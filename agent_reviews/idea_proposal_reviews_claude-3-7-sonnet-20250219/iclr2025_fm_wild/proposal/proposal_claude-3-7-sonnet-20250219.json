        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Reasoning and Planning' challenge identified in the workshop by proposing a hierarchical memory architecture to enhance FMs' multi-step reasoning capabilities. The proposal incorporates the multi-modal aspects mentioned in the research idea, implementing the three-layer memory system (factual knowledge store, reasoning trace memory, and meta-cognitive layer) exactly as outlined. The methodology section thoroughly develops the mathematical formulations for these components. The proposal also builds upon the literature review, addressing key challenges like multi-modal information integration, memory management, reasoning traceability, and error detection through its architectural design. The experimental design across medical, scientific, and mathematical domains aligns with the workshop's scope of in-the-wild applications in critical fields."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally very clear and well-structured. The hierarchical memory system is explained in detail with precise mathematical formulations for each component. The methodology section provides comprehensive explanations of the memory controller functions, integration with foundation models, and experimental design. The research objectives and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for how the system handles transitions between different modalities during reasoning could be more explicitly defined; (2) While the mathematical formulations are thorough, some concrete examples illustrating the reasoning process across modalities would enhance understanding; (3) The proposal could more clearly specify how the system balances computational efficiency with reasoning depth, particularly for resource-constrained environments."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its comprehensive approach to multi-modal reasoning with memory augmentation. The three-tiered memory architecture with specialized functions for each layer represents a fresh perspective on memory augmentation for FMs. The meta-cognitive layer that continuously evaluates reasoning quality and guides error correction is particularly innovative. However, several components build upon existing approaches mentioned in the literature review: memory networks for multi-modal tasks (papers 5 and 6), transformer-based controllers for reasoning paths (paper 7), and meta-cognitive evaluation (paper 8). The proposal synthesizes these concepts into a cohesive system rather than introducing entirely new fundamental mechanisms. While the integration is novel, many of the individual components have precedents in the literature. The proposal would benefit from more explicitly highlighting what specific aspects of the architecture represent advances beyond the current state-of-the-art."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-developed mathematical formulations for each component of the MMRAM architecture. The hierarchical memory system is rigorously defined with appropriate mathematical notation for the factual knowledge store, reasoning trace memory, and meta-cognitive layer. The memory controller functions (retrieval, update, planning, and backtracking) are described with clear mathematical expressions. The integration with foundation models follows a logical approach. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas where additional technical details would strengthen the proposal: (1) The exact mechanism for embedding multi-modal information into a unified representation space (function f_embed) could be more thoroughly specified; (2) The proposal could benefit from more detailed analysis of potential failure modes in the reasoning process; (3) While evaluation metrics are comprehensive, baseline comparisons could be more specifically tied to the state-of-the-art approaches mentioned in the literature review."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined components and implementation strategies. The integration with existing foundation models through a prompt-based interface is practical and doesn't require retraining the base models. The experimental design across three domains with specific datasets and evaluation metrics demonstrates a realistic plan for validation. However, several implementation challenges affect the overall feasibility: (1) The computational requirements for maintaining and operating the three-tiered memory system during complex reasoning tasks may be substantial, potentially limiting real-time applications; (2) Creating high-quality multi-modal datasets with expert annotations for the proposed evaluation domains (especially medical diagnosis) requires significant resources and domain expertise; (3) The proposal doesn't fully address how the system would handle conflicting information across modalities or ambiguous reasoning paths; (4) While the mathematical formulations are sound, implementing efficient algorithms for the memory controller functions (especially the planning and backtracking components) presents non-trivial engineering challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical limitation in current foundation models: their ability to perform complex multi-modal reasoning in real-world applications. This directly aligns with the workshop's focus on making FMs useful 'in the wild.' The potential impact spans multiple high-value domains: (1) In healthcare, enhancing diagnostic reasoning across patient histories, medical imaging, and test results could significantly improve clinical decision support; (2) In scientific research, supporting complex hypothesis generation and validation could accelerate discoveries; (3) In education, enabling personalized guidance based on multi-modal inputs could enhance learning outcomes. The proposal's approach to extending FM capabilities without requiring retraining or parameter growth is particularly significant for practical applications. By addressing fundamental limitations in reasoning capabilities, the research could substantially advance how FMs support expert decision-making in critical domains. The expected 15-20% improvement in reasoning accuracy and 30% reduction in logical inconsistencies would represent meaningful progress in making FMs more reliable for real-world applications."
