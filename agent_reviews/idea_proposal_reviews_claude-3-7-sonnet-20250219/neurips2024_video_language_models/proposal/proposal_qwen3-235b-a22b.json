        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central question of 'How do we make sense of touch?' by focusing on temporal components and the active nature of touch sensing. The TACR-EL framework combines self-supervised learning with active exploration policies as outlined in the research idea. The proposal incorporates insights from the literature review, citing similar approaches to contrastive learning (references [2,4,7]), temporal dynamics (reference [8]), active exploration (references [1,10]), and dataset creation (reference [9]). The methodology addresses all key challenges identified in the literature review, including limited labeled data, temporal dynamics modeling, and active exploration strategies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated with three central questions. The methodology is logically organized into four main components: data collection, temporal-aware contrastive learning, active exploration policy, and experimental design. Mathematical formulations are precisely defined with appropriate notation. The expected outcomes are quantified with specific performance targets. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the contrastive learning module with the RL policy during joint training could be more detailed, (2) some technical terms (e.g., 'Dynamic InfoNCE') are introduced without full explanation, and (3) the relationship between the proposed TouchAct-200k dataset and existing datasets mentioned in the literature review could be more explicitly stated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in several aspects. The integration of temporal-aware contrastive learning with reinforcement learning for active exploration represents a novel approach to tactile representation learning. The 3D Convolutional Transformer architecture specifically designed for tactile sequences is innovative. The proposed TouchAct-200k dataset with diverse sensorimotor interactions would be a valuable contribution to the field. However, many of the individual components build upon existing methods: contrastive learning approaches from [2,4,7], temporal modeling techniques similar to [8], and active exploration strategies that extend work in [1,10]. While the combination and application to tactile sensing is fresh, the core technical innovations are incremental rather than revolutionary. The proposal acknowledges this by positioning itself as building upon existing work (e.g., '97.2% accuracy in [4] with reduced labeling cost')."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The contrastive learning approach is well-grounded in established literature, with appropriate mathematical formulations for the loss functions. The RL formulation as an MDP with clearly defined states, actions, and rewards is technically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and evaluation protocols. The hyperparameter search strategy is comprehensive. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from additional justification: (1) the choice of PPO+LSA over other RL algorithms is not fully explained, (2) the reward function design, particularly the information gain component, could be more thoroughly justified, and (3) the assumption that temporal jittering will generate effective positive pairs for contrastive learning in the tactile domain needs more theoretical support. Overall, the technical approach is well-founded but has minor gaps in justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. The creation of TouchAct-200k with 200 materials and 100 motorized interactions per object is ambitious but achievable with appropriate resources. The contrastive learning and RL components use established algorithms that have been successfully implemented in similar contexts. The experimental design is realistic and well-structured. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) collecting high-quality tactile data across multiple sensors with precise control of pressure, speed, and orientation requires sophisticated robotic setups, (2) the joint training strategy alternating between contrastive pretraining and policy fine-tuning may require significant computational resources and careful optimization, (3) achieving cross-sensor generalization within 'Â±8% accuracy variance' is challenging given the fundamental differences between sensor types, and (4) the timeline for completing all aspects of the proposal (dataset creation, model development, extensive experiments) is not specified but likely demanding. While these challenges are significant, they do not render the proposal impractical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in tactile sensing and has the potential for significant impact. As noted in the task description, touch processing is an emerging field with applications in robotics, prosthetics, and AR/VR. The proposed framework directly addresses the workshop's goal of developing 'foundations of this new computational science dedicated to the processing and understanding of touch sensing.' The expected outcomes include substantial improvements in texture classification accuracy and material property estimation, which would advance the state of the art in tactile perception. The open-source release of TouchAct-200k and TACR-EL tools aligns with the workshop's aim to 'lower the entry barrier for all AI researchers interested in exploring this new field.' The practical applications in agricultural robotics, prosthetics, and haptic interfaces are well-justified and impactful. However, the proposal could more explicitly address how the findings might generalize beyond the specific sensors and materials studied, which would enhance its broader significance."
