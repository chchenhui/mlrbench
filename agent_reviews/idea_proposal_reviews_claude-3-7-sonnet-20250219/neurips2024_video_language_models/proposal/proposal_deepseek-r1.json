    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on touch processing, specifically tackling the unique challenges of touch as a sensing modality: temporal components, active nature, and local sensing. The proposal incorporates the self-supervised learning and active exploration components outlined in the research idea, and builds upon the literature review by citing relevant works (e.g., AcTExplore, Contrastive Touch-to-Touch, M2CURL) and addressing key challenges identified in the review such as limited labeled data, temporal dynamics modeling, and active exploration strategies. The proposal's focus on releasing open-source tools and datasets also aligns with the workshop's goal of lowering entry barriers for AI researchers interested in touch processing."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is described in detail with appropriate technical formulations. The introduction provides a clear context and motivation, while the methodology section outlines the data collection, representation learning approach, and active exploration strategy with sufficient technical depth. The expected outcomes and impact are also well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the specific mechanisms for integrating the contrastive learning module with the RL agent could be more explicitly described, (2) the evaluation protocols for cross-sensor generalization tests mentioned in the expected outcomes could be elaborated, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the information gain reward component in the RL formulation could be more precisely defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining temporal-aware representation learning with active exploration in the tactile domain. While individual components like contrastive learning and reinforcement learning for active exploration have been explored in prior work (as evidenced in the literature review), the integration of these approaches specifically for tactile sensing with an emphasis on temporal dynamics represents a fresh perspective. The proposal's novelty lies in: (1) the joint optimization of representation learning and exploration policies, (2) the specific focus on temporal coherence in tactile sequences, and (3) the development of a curiosity-driven reward function for tactile exploration. However, the core technical approaches (CNN-LSTM architecture, contrastive learning, PPO) are established methods rather than entirely new techniques, which somewhat limits the novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established techniques from deep learning and reinforcement learning. The contrastive learning objective using NT-Xent loss is appropriate for the self-supervised learning task, and the RL formulation with information gain and curiosity rewards is well-justified for active exploration. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, tasks, and metrics for evaluation, along with ablation studies to analyze the contribution of different components. The technical formulations are correct and clearly presented. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes a comprehensive evaluation plan. One minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions freezing the tactile encoder during RL training to stabilize learning, it doesn't fully address potential issues with the joint optimization of representation learning and exploration policies, which could present theoretical and practical challenges."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it will require significant resources and expertise. The hardware requirements (GelSight sensor, 6-DOF robotic arm) are commercially available, and the computational approaches (CNN-LSTM, contrastive learning, PPO) have established implementations. The data collection plan is realistic, though collecting interactions on 100+ material types will be time-intensive. The development of a PyBullet-based tactile simulator adds complexity but will be valuable for pretraining. The main feasibility challenges include: (1) the integration of the contrastive learning and RL components may require careful engineering and hyperparameter tuning, (2) designing an effective reward function that balances information gain and curiosity could be challenging, and (3) collecting a large-scale tactile dataset with diverse materials and interactions will require substantial time and resources. Overall, while ambitious, the proposal is implementable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in tactile perception with significant potential impact. By developing methods for temporal-aware tactile representation learning and active exploration, the research could advance robotic manipulation capabilities in unstructured environments, improve haptic interfaces, and enhance sensory feedback in prosthetics. These applications align well with the workshop's vision and have real-world relevance. The release of a large-scale tactile dataset and open-source tools will benefit the broader research community and lower barriers to entry in this emerging field. The expected improvements (15-20% accuracy increase in texture recognition, 30% reduction in data collection time) would represent meaningful advances. The proposal also has interdisciplinary significance, potentially fostering collaboration across AI, robotics, and neuroscience. While the impact is substantial, it's not transformative enough to warrant a 9 or 10, as the proposal builds upon existing approaches rather than introducing paradigm-shifting concepts."
