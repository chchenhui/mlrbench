        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the call for 'approaches that account for interactions between traditional sub-components (e.g., joint perception and prediction)' by proposing a model that bridges perception and prediction. It also strongly addresses the representation learning aspect and explicitly focuses on interpretability, which matches the task's emphasis on 'ML/statistical learning approaches to facilitate safety/interpretability/generalization.' The idea is highly relevant to the workshop's goal of promoting real-world impact in self-driving technology through better integration strategies and intermediate representations."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is generally well-articulated and understandable. It clearly identifies the problem (black-box nature of current joint perception-prediction models), proposes a solution (interpretable interaction representations), and suggests implementation approaches (graph neural networks or attention mechanisms). However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific structure of the proposed intermediate representation, how exactly the attention weights or graph edge features would be made interpretable, and what metrics would be used to evaluate interpretability. The technical details of how this module would be integrated into the broader autonomous driving stack are also somewhat vague."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by focusing specifically on interpretable interaction representations as an intermediate layer between perception and prediction. While both graph neural networks and attention mechanisms are established techniques in autonomous driving research, their application specifically for interpretable interaction modeling as a bridge between perception and prediction appears to be a fresh perspective. The emphasis on making the interaction strengths and types explicitly interpretable adds novelty. However, the core techniques mentioned (GNNs, attention) are well-established, and similar approaches to modeling agent interactions exist, though perhaps not with the same focus on interpretability as a bridge between perception and prediction."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Graph neural networks and attention mechanisms are well-established techniques with mature implementations available. Datasets for autonomous driving that include multi-agent interactions are readily available (e.g., nuScenes, Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse). The primary technical challenge would be designing the interaction representations to be truly interpretable while maintaining prediction accuracy, but this seems achievable with careful design and evaluation. The proposal doesn't require any breakthrough technologies or unrealistic computational resources, making it implementable with current research capabilities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This idea addresses a critical challenge in autonomous driving: understanding and explaining agent interactions for safer prediction. The significance is high because interpretability is crucial for deploying autonomous vehicles in real-world settings where safety certification, debugging, and human trust are essential. By making interaction reasoning explicit and interpretable, the approach could significantly advance both the technical performance of prediction systems and their practical deployability. The impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in the autonomous driving industry, potentially influencing how future systems are designed and validated. The approach could also generalize to other multi-agent prediction domains beyond driving."
