    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on representation learning, integration strategies, and approaches that account for interactions between traditional sub-components. The proposed Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Graph (HSG) framework faithfully implements the core idea of combining static and dynamic elements in a unified representation while incorporating self-supervised contrastive learning for better generalization. The proposal thoroughly references and builds upon the literature review, citing relevant works like HDGT, STGAT, Trajectron++, and others. It also addresses all five key challenges identified in the literature review: integration of static and dynamic elements, scalability, multi-sensor data fusion, generalization to unseen scenarios, and safety-critical decision making. The only minor inconsistency is that the proposal expands significantly beyond the initial idea with more technical details, but this enhances rather than detracts from the alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, research gap, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations for the graph construction, attention mechanisms, and loss functions. The hierarchical structure of the graph and the joint perception-prediction framework are well-defined. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear baselines, ablation studies, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact implementation of the hierarchical structure could be more precisely defined, as the proposal mentions both spatial and temporal hierarchies but focuses primarily on spatial; (2) the integration between the perception refinement and trajectory prediction components could be more explicitly detailed; and (3) some technical terms (e.g., DiffPool) are mentioned without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with these techniques."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality in several aspects. The key innovation is the hierarchical spatiotemporal graph structure that integrates both static and dynamic elements within a unified representation, which extends beyond existing graph-based approaches that typically focus on either static elements or dynamic agents separately. The incorporation of adaptive edge weights using attention mechanisms to model the dynamic relevance of interactions is also innovative. Additionally, the joint perception-prediction framework and the application of self-supervised contrastive learning to graph representations for autonomous driving are relatively novel combinations. However, many of the individual components (GNNs, attention mechanisms, contrastive learning) are well-established techniques in the literature. The proposal builds incrementally on existing graph-based methods like HDGT and Trajectron++ rather than proposing a fundamentally new paradigm. While the integration is novel, the core technical approaches leverage existing methodologies in new combinations rather than introducing groundbreaking new algorithms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness and rigor. The graph formulation is mathematically well-defined, with clear specifications for nodes, edges, and their features. The attention mechanism for adaptive edge weights is properly formulated with equations. The spatiotemporal encoding using GNNs and temporal models is technically sound and follows established practices in the field. The loss functions for joint learning and contrastive learning are well-specified. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, ablation studies, and evaluation metrics. The proposal is grounded in relevant literature and builds on established methods in graph neural networks, trajectory prediction, and representation learning. However, there are a few areas that could be strengthened: (1) the theoretical justification for why the hierarchical structure would be beneficial over flat graphs could be more developed; (2) the proposal could more thoroughly address potential challenges in training such a complex model end-to-end; and (3) while the contrastive learning approach is sound, more details on how to ensure the augmentations preserve semantic meaning in the driving context would enhance rigor."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is moderately feasible but presents several implementation challenges. On the positive side, it leverages existing datasets (nuScenes, Waymo, Argoverse 2) and builds on established methods in graph neural networks and trajectory prediction. The modular design allows for incremental development and testing. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The computational complexity of processing hierarchical graphs with attention mechanisms for large scenes with many agents and map elements could be prohibitive for real-time applications; (2) Training such a complex model end-to-end with multiple loss components might require extensive hyperparameter tuning and could face optimization difficulties; (3) The integration of multi-modal sensor data (LiDAR, camera) into a unified graph representation is challenging and may require sophisticated pre-processing pipelines; (4) The proposal mentions but does not fully address how to handle the varying number of nodes and edges across different scenes and time steps; (5) The self-supervised contrastive learning component requires careful design of augmentations specific to the driving domain, which adds another layer of complexity. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively suggest that implementing the full system as described would require significant engineering effort and computational resources, and might need to be scaled back in practice."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in autonomous driving: the need for unified scene representations that can integrate static and dynamic elements while supporting joint perception and prediction. If successful, this research could have substantial impact in several ways: (1) It could improve the accuracy and robustness of autonomous driving systems, particularly in complex interactive scenarios like urban intersections; (2) The explicit modeling of interactions could lead to safer planning decisions; (3) The unified representation could reduce error propagation between perception and prediction modules; (4) The self-supervised learning component could reduce dependency on labeled data, which is a significant bottleneck in autonomous driving development; (5) The hierarchical approach could provide insights into multi-scale reasoning for dynamic scenes. The proposal aligns well with industry trends toward more integrated architectures for autonomous driving. The expected improvements of 10-20% over baselines would be meaningful in practice, especially for safety-critical applications. However, the significance is somewhat tempered by the fact that the proposal is evolutionary rather than revolutionary, building incrementally on existing approaches rather than proposing a paradigm shift in autonomous driving architecture."
