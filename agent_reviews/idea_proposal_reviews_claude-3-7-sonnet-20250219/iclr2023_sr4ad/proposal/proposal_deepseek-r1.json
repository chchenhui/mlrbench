    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on representation learning and integration strategies for autonomous driving by proposing a hierarchical spatiotemporal graph (HSTG) that unifies static and dynamic elements. The methodology incorporates joint perception-prediction learning as specified in the task description, and the contrastive learning approach aims to enhance safety and generalization. The proposal builds upon the literature review by referencing and extending works like VAD, HDGT, Trajectron++, and Social-STGCNN, addressing the key challenges identified in the review regarding integration of static and dynamic elements, scalability, and generalization to unseen scenarios. The only minor inconsistency is that while the idea mentioned 'advancing end-to-end driving systems,' the proposal focuses more on unified representation rather than fully end-to-end driving."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from motivation to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical details are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the approach understandable to domain experts. The hierarchical structure of the graph (static, dynamic, and temporal layers) is well-defined, and the learning objectives are explicitly stated. The experimental design outlines clear metrics and baselines for evaluation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for cross-layer interactions between static and dynamic elements could be more explicitly defined, (2) the details of how the contrastive learning approach generates augmented views of scenes could be elaborated, and (3) the proposal could more clearly explain how the unified representation would be used in downstream planning tasks."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a hierarchical spatiotemporal graph that integrates static map features and dynamic agent states into a unified representation. While graph-based approaches for trajectory prediction exist in the literature (e.g., HDGT, Social-STGCNN), this proposal innovates by combining three distinct layers (static, dynamic, temporal) and introducing adaptive attention weights for modeling interactions. The self-supervised contrastive learning approach for scene graphs is a fresh perspective that could reduce dependency on labeled data. However, many of the individual components (GATv2, TCNs, contrastive learning) are established techniques being applied to a new problem rather than fundamentally new methods. The proposal builds incrementally on existing work rather than presenting a revolutionary paradigm shift, which is why it scores well but not at the highest level of novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for adaptive attention weights, temporal convolutions, and contrastive learning are well-defined and theoretically sound. The approach builds on established graph neural network architectures (GATv2) and temporal modeling techniques (TCNs) with appropriate citations to prior work. The experimental design includes relevant metrics (mAP, ADE/FDE) and baselines (VAD, HDGT, Trajectron++) for comprehensive evaluation. The two-phase training protocol (pretraining and fine-tuning) is well-justified. The proposal also acknowledges the challenges of integrating multiple data sources and provides preprocessing steps to address them. One minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions Kalman filtering for temporal alignment, it doesn't fully address potential issues with sensor synchronization and occlusion handling in complex environments."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it would require significant engineering effort. The datasets mentioned (nuScenes, Argoverse 2) are publicly available and appropriate for the task. The graph neural network architectures and contrastive learning approaches have established implementations that could be adapted. However, there are several implementation challenges: (1) constructing and maintaining hierarchical graphs with thousands of nodes in real-time could be computationally intensive, potentially requiring optimization or hardware acceleration; (2) the integration of multiple sensor modalities (LiDAR, camera, HD maps) would require careful calibration and synchronization; (3) the two-phase training protocol with contrastive learning might require substantial computational resources. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but could benefit from more detailed discussion of computational requirements and potential optimizations for real-time performance."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in autonomous driving: the fragmentation of perception, prediction, and planning modules that leads to error propagation and reduced robustness. By unifying scene representation through hierarchical spatiotemporal graphs, the approach could substantially improve the performance and reliability of autonomous driving systems, particularly in complex urban environments. The expected outcomes (15-20% reduction in ADE, 10% improvement in mAP, 30-50% reduction in annotation needs) would represent meaningful advances in the field. The explicit modeling of interactions could enhance safety in multi-agent scenarios, addressing a critical concern for real-world deployment. The unified representation could also serve as a foundation for future research in end-to-end driving systems. While the impact would be substantial within the autonomous driving domain, it doesn't necessarily extend to broader AI applications, which is why it scores highly but not at the maximum level."

        "justification": "This proposal presents a well-conceived, technically sound approach to unified scene representation for autonomous driving. It effectively addresses the workshop's focus on integration strategies and intermediate representations, with clear potential for real-world impact. The hierarchical spatiotemporal graph structure offers a promising framework for jointly modeling static and dynamic elements, while the contrastive learning approach could reduce dependency on labeled data. The proposal builds thoughtfully on existing literature while introducing novel elements, particularly in the hierarchical structure and adaptive edge weights.
