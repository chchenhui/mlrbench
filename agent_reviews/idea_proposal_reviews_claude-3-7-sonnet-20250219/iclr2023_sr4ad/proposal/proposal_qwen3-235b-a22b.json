    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on representation learning and integration strategies for autonomous driving by proposing a hierarchical spatiotemporal graph (HSTG) that unifies static and dynamic elements. The proposal incorporates all key aspects mentioned in the original idea, including the hierarchical graph structure, temporal modeling via TCNs, and self-supervised contrastive learning. It builds upon the literature review by extending works like HDGT [4], STGAT [5], and Trajectron++ [9], while addressing the identified challenges of integrating static and dynamic elements, computational efficiency, and safety-critical decision making. The methodology section thoroughly explains how the approach will overcome these challenges through adaptive edge weights, multimodal sensor fusion, and explicit modeling of actor interactions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described in detail, including mathematical formulations for node representations, edge definitions, and learning algorithms. The experimental design section outlines specific datasets, metrics, and baselines for evaluation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the hierarchical levels in the graph structure could be more explicitly defined, (2) the integration of the contrastive learning framework with the main architecture could be elaborated further, and (3) some technical details about the planning component are less developed compared to the perception and prediction aspects. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a hierarchical spatiotemporal graph that unifies static infrastructure and dynamic actors in a shared representation. This approach extends beyond existing works like HDGT [4] and Trajectron++ [9] by incorporating hierarchical temporal layers and contrastive learning. The integration of multimodal sensor data (LiDAR, camera, motion) into the graph framework is also innovative. However, many of the individual components (GATs, TCNs, contrastive learning) have been previously explored in related contexts, and the proposal builds incrementally on existing graph-based approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The novelty lies primarily in the specific combination of these techniques and their application to the unified scene representation problem, rather than in developing entirely new methodological approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established methods from graph neural networks, temporal modeling, and contrastive learning. The mathematical formulations for node representations, edge weights, and message passing are correctly specified and consistent with the literature. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets (NuScenes, Argoverse 2, KITTI) and evaluation metrics (ADE/FDE, mAP, NDS) that are standard in the field. The methodology builds logically on prior work and addresses known limitations. The integration of spatial and temporal modeling is well-justified, and the use of contrastive learning to improve generalization is supported by recent advances in self-supervised learning. One minor limitation is that the proposal could provide more detailed justification for some of the architectural choices, such as the specific form of the attention mechanism and the depth of the TCN layers. Overall, the approach is rigorous and well-founded in both theory and empirical considerations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The use of established datasets (NuScenes, Argoverse 2, KITTI) and frameworks (PyTorch Geometric) provides a solid foundation. The individual components (graph neural networks, temporal convolutions, contrastive learning) have been successfully implemented in related contexts. However, several aspects may require significant engineering effort: (1) the integration of multimodal sensor data into a unified graph structure is complex and computationally intensive, (2) training the full system end-to-end with both static and dynamic elements may require substantial computational resources, and (3) the proposed 20% reduction in computational latency compared to Trajectron++ may be challenging to achieve given the added complexity of the hierarchical structure. The proposal acknowledges these challenges implicitly but could benefit from a more explicit discussion of potential implementation difficulties and mitigation strategies. Despite these concerns, the overall approach appears implementable with appropriate resources and optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in autonomous driving: the integration of fragmented perception and prediction systems. By developing a unified representation that combines static infrastructure and dynamic actors, the research could significantly impact the field in several ways: (1) reducing error propagation between modular components, (2) improving accuracy in complex urban scenarios through explicit modeling of interactions, (3) enhancing generalization to unseen scenarios via contrastive learning, and (4) enabling safer planning through better understanding of actor interactions. The expected performance improvements (15% reduction in ADE/FDE, NDS improvement to 62.0, 30% fewer collisions in edge cases) would represent meaningful advances over current state-of-the-art methods. The approach also aligns well with industry trends toward more integrated autonomous driving systems. While the impact may not be transformative in the sense of completely revolutionizing autonomous driving, it represents a significant step forward in addressing a fundamental limitation of current approaches."
