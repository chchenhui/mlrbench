        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea on Cross-Modal Watermarking for Trustworthy AI-Generated Content aligns excellently with the task description on Trustworthy Multi-modal Foundation Models and AI Agents. The proposal directly addresses one of the explicitly mentioned topics in the task description: 'Identifiers of AI-generated material, such as watermarking.' The idea focuses on creating watermarking techniques that work across multiple modalities (text, image, audio, video), which is perfectly aligned with the multi-modal focus of the task. The proposal also addresses transparency and accountability concerns mentioned in the task description, and contributes to the broader goal of building trustworthy AI systems. The only minor reason it doesn't receive a perfect 10 is that it focuses primarily on watermarking without explicitly addressing some of the other aspects of trustworthiness mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (distinguishing AI-generated from human-created content across modalities), the proposed solution (cross-modal watermarking framework), and the key innovations (modal-invariant encoding, hierarchical patterns, and self-supervised learning). The motivation and potential impact are well-explained. However, there are some technical details that could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific frequency domain transformations to be used, how exactly the modal-invariant watermark encoding would work across dramatically different modalities, and what metrics would be used to evaluate the trade-off between watermark robustness and content quality. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. While watermarking for AI-generated content is not new, the cross-modal approach that maintains detectability across modality transformations represents a fresh and innovative direction. The concept of modal-invariant watermark encoding that preserves signatures across transformations (e.g., text-to-speech) is particularly novel. The hierarchical watermarking patterns and self-supervised learning mechanism for optimizing robustness also add originality. However, some elements build upon existing watermarking techniques and frequency domain transformations that have been explored in digital watermarking literature, which is why it doesn't receive a perfect novelty score. The innovation lies more in the application and integration of these techniques in a cross-modal AI context rather than in completely new fundamental methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several significant challenges. While watermarking within individual modalities (text, images, audio) has been demonstrated, creating truly modal-invariant watermarks that survive transformations between dramatically different modalities (e.g., image-to-text or audio-to-image) presents substantial technical hurdles. The proposal doesn't detail how it would overcome the fundamental information loss that occurs during such transformations. Additionally, ensuring watermarks remain imperceptible while being robust against manipulations involves complex trade-offs. The self-supervised learning approach is promising but would require extensive computational resources and careful design. The hierarchical watermarking system adds another layer of complexity. While the core concept is implementable with current technology, achieving all the stated goals simultaneously would require considerable research breakthroughs, making this a challenging but not impossible project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research idea is exceptionally high given the rapid advancement and deployment of multi-modal AI systems. As AI-generated content becomes increasingly indistinguishable from human-created content, the ability to authenticate and trace such content becomes crucial for addressing misinformation, deep fakes, copyright issues, and maintaining trust in digital information. The cross-modal approach is particularly significant as content often flows between modalities in real-world scenarios. If successful, this framework could become a standard component of responsible AI deployment, enabling platforms to automatically verify AI-generated content and helping users make informed decisions about the content they consume. The potential impact extends to policy-making, legal frameworks, and broader societal trust in digital media. The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 10 is that watermarking alone cannot solve all trustworthiness issues with AI systems."
