        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Identifiers of AI-generated material, such as watermarking' topic explicitly mentioned in the TiFA task. The proposal directly tackles the challenge of verifying AI-generated content provenance in multi-modal generative models (MMGMs), which is a core concern highlighted in the task description. The idea also touches on transparency, accountability, and technical approaches to regulation, which are other key topics in the task. The focus on combating misinformation through robust watermarking is highly relevant to the trustworthiness concerns outlined in the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (differentiating AI-generated content and tracing origins), the proposed solution (latent space watermarking before generation), and the intended outcomes (resilient watermarks that survive post-processing). The technical approach is well-defined, explaining how the watermark would be embedded in the latent space and manifest in the output. The only minor ambiguities are in the specific technical details of how the watermark would be encoded and decoded across different modalities, and how the verification process would work in practice, which would naturally be elaborated in a full proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in several aspects. While watermarking for AI-generated content isn't new, the cross-modal approach that works in the latent space before generation represents a fresh perspective. The focus on maintaining watermark integrity across different modalities (text, image, video, audio) and designing for resilience against common manipulations shows innovation beyond current approaches. However, it builds upon existing watermarking concepts rather than introducing a completely revolutionary approach. The integration with MMGMs and the emphasis on cross-modal verification does provide a meaningful advancement over current single-modality watermarking techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces some significant challenges. While watermarking in individual modalities has been demonstrated, creating a unified framework that works across modalities and is robust to various transformations is considerably more difficult. The proposal requires access to and modification of the latent space of state-of-the-art MMGMs, which may be challenging depending on model access. Additionally, ensuring the watermark is both imperceptible to humans yet robust against manipulations presents a fundamental trade-off that's difficult to optimize. The idea is implementable with current technology, but would require considerable research effort to overcome these challenges, particularly in maintaining watermark fidelity across dramatic transformations (e.g., text-to-video)."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in the era of increasingly powerful generative AI. As models like Sora make AI-generated content nearly indistinguishable from real content, the ability to verify provenance becomes essential for combating misinformation, deepfakes, and ensuring accountability. The cross-modal approach is particularly significant as it addresses a gap in current watermarking solutions. If successful, this work could establish a standard for responsible AI content generation and provide crucial tools for content verification across platforms. The societal impact could be substantial, helping maintain trust in digital media and providing a technical foundation for regulatory approaches to AI-generated content."
