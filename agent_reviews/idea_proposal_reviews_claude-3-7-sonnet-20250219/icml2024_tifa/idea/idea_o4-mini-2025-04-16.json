        "justification": "The CrossModMark proposal aligns excellently with the TiFA task description. It directly addresses the need for 'identifiers of AI-generated material, such as watermarking' which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest. The proposal focuses on multi-modal foundation models (MFMs), which are the central focus of the task. The research specifically targets the challenge of tracking provenance across different modalities (text, images, audio, video) produced by these models, which is highly relevant to the trustworthiness concerns outlined in the task description. The proposal also touches on regulatory aspects and content authenticity, which aligns with the task's emphasis on 'AI governance and regulatory insights'."

        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (lack of cross-modal watermarking solutions), proposes a specific approach (embedding watermarks in joint latent space), outlines the methodology (lightweight watermark encoder with contrastive learning objectives), and specifies expected outcomes (>95% detection accuracy, <1% utility loss). The technical approach involving adversarial training to simulate real-world manipulations is well-explained. However, some technical details about how the watermark encoder would work across different modalities could be more precisely defined, and the exact mechanism for ensuring the watermark survives transformations across modalities could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by addressing a gap in current watermarking approaches. While watermarking exists for individual modalities (images, text, etc.), the concept of a unified cross-modal watermarking system that operates in the joint latent space of multi-modal models represents a novel contribution. The adversarial training approach to ensure robustness across transformations and modalities is innovative. The proposal correctly identifies that existing watermarking schemes are modality-specific and often fail under common transformations, making this cross-modal approach a meaningful advancement over the state-of-the-art. The integration of contrastive learning objectives for watermark detection across modalities is particularly innovative."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally feasible but faces some implementation challenges. The core idea of embedding watermarks in the joint latent space is technically sound and builds on existing watermarking and multi-modal embedding techniques. However, achieving the ambitious goals of >95% detection accuracy under diverse transformations while maintaining <1% utility loss may be challenging. The approach requires access to and modification of the training process of large multi-modal models, which could be resource-intensive. The adversarial training to simulate real-world manipulations is computationally expensive but achievable with sufficient resources. Integration with existing MFMs like LLaVA+Stable Diffusion and Sora is realistic but would require significant engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical challenge in the era of increasingly powerful multi-modal generative AI. As these systems produce more convincing content across modalities, the ability to track provenance becomes essential for mitigating misuse and maintaining trust. The proposal has significant implications for content authenticity, combating misinformation, and supporting regulatory frameworks. The cross-modal nature of the watermarking solution is particularly significant as it addresses a fundamental limitation of current approaches. If successful, this work could establish a new standard for watermarking in multi-modal AI systems and directly contribute to the trustworthiness of these technologies. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in content verification systems."
