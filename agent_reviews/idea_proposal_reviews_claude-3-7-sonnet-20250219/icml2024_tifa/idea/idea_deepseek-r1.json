    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description of 'Trustworthy Multi-modal Foundation Models and AI Agents.' It directly addresses the novel safety challenges with new modalities, which is explicitly listed as a topic in the task description. The proposal covers adversarial attacks and defenses, robustness issues, and technical approaches to safety - all key elements mentioned in the task. The focus on proactive risk assessment for emerging modalities (3D, thermal, depth) perfectly matches the task's emphasis on 'preempting vulnerabilities' and 'proactive risk assessment.' The idea's three-part framework (threat modeling, attack simulation, and mitigation) comprehensively addresses the security concerns outlined in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity and structure. The motivation clearly establishes the problem space, explaining why novel modalities in MFMs present unexplored safety risks. The main idea is well-articulated with a three-part framework that provides a logical progression from threat modeling to attack simulation to mitigation strategies. Each component is explained with specific examples (e.g., LiDAR spoofing, thermal/RGB misalignment) that make the concepts concrete. The expected outcomes are also clearly defined. The only minor ambiguity is in the specifics of how the validation would be conducted - while it mentions using 'prototype MFMs,' more details on evaluation metrics and success criteria would have made this aspect even clearer."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea demonstrates excellent novelty by addressing a significant gap in current safety research. While most safety evaluations focus on established modalities like text, image, and audio, this proposal specifically targets understudied emerging modalities such as 3D point clouds, thermal imaging, and depth sensors. The cross-modal vulnerability analysis approach is particularly innovative, as it examines not just individual modalities but their interactions, which is an under-explored area. The concept of developing modality-specific threat models and tailored adversarial perturbations for disrupting modality fusion layers represents a fresh approach to multi-modal safety. The proactive stance - identifying vulnerabilities before widespread deployment - is forward-thinking compared to the reactive approaches common in the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally feasible but faces some implementation challenges. On the positive side, the methodological framework is logical and builds on existing adversarial machine learning techniques. Creating taxonomies of risks and designing targeted perturbations are established research practices that can be adapted to new modalities. However, several practical challenges exist: (1) Access to diverse multi-modal foundation models with novel modalities may be limited, as many cutting-edge MFMs are proprietary; (2) Creating realistic attack scenarios for emerging modalities requires specialized domain knowledge across multiple fields; (3) Validating the effectiveness of proposed safeguards would require extensive testing across diverse scenarios. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the research impossible - rather, they suggest the need for careful scoping and potentially collaborative approaches with domain experts."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in AI safety with high potential impact. As multi-modal foundation models expand to include new sensing capabilities and are deployed in high-stakes domains like healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and security systems, the safety implications become increasingly consequential. By proactively identifying vulnerabilities in novel modalities before widespread deployment, this research could prevent serious harms. The proposed vulnerability catalog and defensive toolkits would provide practical resources for developers of multi-modal systems, potentially establishing safety standards for an emerging technology. The cross-modal perspective is particularly significant as it addresses complex interaction effects that might otherwise be overlooked. This work could influence how the AI community approaches safety for next-generation multi-modal systems, making it highly significant for both research and practical applications."
