    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for trustworthy multi-modal foundation models by focusing on watermarking for AI-generated content provenance, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic in the task description. The proposal comprehensively expands on the initial research idea, maintaining its core focus on cross-modal watermarking embedded in latent spaces while adding technical depth and implementation details. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with the proposal building upon existing works like InvisMark and GenPTW while addressing limitations identified in papers like 'Watermarks in the Sand' (reference 8). The methodology specifically addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as robustness against manipulations and cross-modal effectiveness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and broken down into specific goals. The technical approach is presented with mathematical formulations that precisely define the watermarking embedding and extraction processes. The experimental design includes concrete metrics and baselines for evaluation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for cross-modal watermark persistence could be more explicitly detailed, (2) some technical terms (e.g., LPIPS, MUSHRA) are used without definition, and (3) the relationship between watermark strength parameter Î± and perceptual quality trade-offs could be more thoroughly explained. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal remains highly comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. First, it introduces a unified cross-modal watermarking framework that works across text, image, video, and audio modalities, which addresses a gap in existing literature that primarily focuses on single-modal approaches. Second, it proposes embedding watermarks directly in the latent space before content generation, which is a fresh approach compared to post-generation watermarking. Third, the modality-specific injection techniques are innovative, particularly the integration with latent diffusion's noise prediction step and the use of FFT transformations for spatial transformation resistance. The proposal also introduces a novel multi-task loss function that balances perceptual quality, watermark reconstruction, and adversarial robustness. While some individual components build upon existing techniques (as acknowledged in the baselines section), the integration and application to cross-modal scenarios represent a meaningful advancement beyond current approaches documented in the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for watermark embedding and extraction are well-defined and appear technically correct. The multi-task loss function appropriately balances competing objectives of imperceptibility, robustness, and watermark fidelity. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics for evaluation. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the proposal claims watermark persistence despite modality transformations, but doesn't fully explain how the watermark survives the decoder-encoder transitions between modalities; (2) while the paper references adversarial training using PGD, it doesn't address potential limitations of this approach against adaptive adversaries; (3) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the theoretical impossibility results from reference 8 ('Watermarks in the Sand'), instead suggesting that careful parameter balancing might overcome these limitations without providing rigorous proof. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is methodologically sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The implementation leverages existing frameworks (PyTorch, HuggingFace, fairseq) and models (Stable Diffusion, Sora), which increases practicality. The data collection strategy is comprehensive and achievable, using established datasets and models to generate training samples. The evaluation metrics and experimental design are well-specified and implementable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the proposal requires access to large-scale MMGMs like Sora, which may have limited availability or high computational costs; (2) generating and processing 100,000+ cross-modal samples will require significant computational resources; (3) achieving the claimed >90% bit accuracy across all modalities and transformations may be challenging given the theoretical limitations noted in reference 8; (4) the timeline for implementation is not specified, making it difficult to assess temporal feasibility. While these challenges exist, they don't fundamentally undermine the project's implementability, especially if the researchers have access to appropriate computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety and trustworthiness with far-reaching implications. As multi-modal generative models become more powerful and widespread, the ability to verify content provenance becomes essential for combating misinformation, ensuring accountability, and maintaining public trust. The proposed framework directly addresses this need with potential applications in media verification, regulatory compliance, and content authentication. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act. The expected outcomes include not just technical advancements but also practical tools (open-source libraries, benchmark datasets) that can be adopted by platforms and service providers. The societal impact is well-articulated, with clear connections to media accountability, policy compliance, and public awareness. The commercialization potential through partnerships with cloud AI providers further demonstrates the practical significance of the work. Overall, this research addresses a pressing technological and societal challenge with substantial potential for real-world impact."
