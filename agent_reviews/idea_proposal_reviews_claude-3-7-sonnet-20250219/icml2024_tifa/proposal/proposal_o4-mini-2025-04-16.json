    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for trustworthy multi-modal foundation models by developing a watermarking framework for AI-generated content provenance across modalities (text, image, audio, video). The proposal builds upon existing watermarking techniques identified in the literature review (e.g., InvisMark, GenPTW, VLPMarker) while addressing their limitations in cross-modal scenarios. It specifically targets the challenges outlined in the literature review, including robustness against manipulations, security against adversarial attacks, and cross-modal watermarking. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposed approach will embed watermarks in the latent space before generation, ensuring traceability across different modalities, which directly aligns with the core idea presented."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented with appropriate technical detail, including mathematical formulations of the embedding and decoding processes. The data flow is logically explained, and the training objectives are well-defined with clear loss functions. The experimental design section provides comprehensive details on datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for cross-modal decoding could be more explicitly detailed, (2) the relationship between the watermark bits and the cryptographic hash could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., BCH error-correcting code) are introduced without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with these concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The concept of embedding watermarks in the latent space before generation across multiple modalities with a unified decoder represents an innovative approach not fully explored in the literature. The adversarial training regime specifically designed for watermark robustness is a novel contribution, as is the cross-modal code design with error correction capabilities. The proposal extends beyond existing works like InvisMark and GenPTW by addressing multi-modal scenarios and providing a unified framework that works across text, image, audio, and video. However, some individual components (like latent space perturbation and adversarial training) build upon established techniques, albeit applied in a new context. The proposal's primary innovation lies in the integration and adaptation of these techniques into a cohesive cross-modal watermarking framework rather than introducing entirely new fundamental concepts."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The technical foundations of the proposal are generally sound. The mathematical formulations for the embedding and decoding processes are well-defined, and the training objectives incorporate appropriate loss functions for generation fidelity, watermark decoding, and regularization. The adversarial training approach is well-justified for enhancing robustness. However, there are some potential theoretical concerns: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address the theoretical limitations mentioned in reference [8] regarding the impossibility of strong watermarking for generative models; (2) The trade-offs between imperceptibility, robustness, and computational overhead are acknowledged but not rigorously analyzed; (3) While the proposal mentions BCH error-correcting codes, it doesn't provide sufficient justification for this specific choice over alternatives; (4) The assumption that a single decoder can effectively extract watermarks across all modalities may need stronger theoretical justification given the significant differences between modalities."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined implementation steps. The use of existing architectures (U-Net, CNN, transformer) as building blocks enhances practicality. The computational requirements are explicitly stated (8 × NVIDIA A100 GPUs, 4-6 weeks training), which seems reasonable for the scope of the project. The evaluation metrics and datasets are well-established and appropriate. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) Training a unified decoder that works effectively across all modalities may be more difficult than anticipated; (2) The robustness requirements (e.g., JPEG Q10-Q95, cropping ≥30%) are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve simultaneously with high imperceptibility; (3) The adversarial training regime adds significant computational complexity; (4) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address how to handle the varying latent space structures across different model architectures; (5) Integration with existing models like Stable Diffusion and Sora may present unforeseen technical challenges due to their architectural differences."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical need in the field of trustworthy AI, particularly as multi-modal generative models become more powerful and widespread. The ability to trace the provenance of AI-generated content across modalities has significant implications for combating misinformation, ensuring accountability, and supporting regulatory compliance. The technical contributions (unified cross-modal watermarking, adversarial training for robustness, quantitative trade-off curves) would advance the scientific understanding of watermarking in generative AI. The societal impact is substantial, providing tools for platforms to tag and track AI-generated content, empowering copyright holders, and laying groundwork for multi-modal watermarking standards. The proposal directly addresses one of the key topics mentioned in the task description: 'Identifiers of AI-generated material, such as watermarking.' The deliverables (library, checkpoints, benchmark suite, white paper) would provide practical tools for the research community and industry, potentially influencing standardization efforts in AI watermarking."
