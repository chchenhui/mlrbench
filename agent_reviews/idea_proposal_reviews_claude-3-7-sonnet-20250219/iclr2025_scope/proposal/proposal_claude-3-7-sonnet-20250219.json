        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on efficient long context understanding and sub-quadratic models for foundational tasks. The proposal incorporates the core elements from the research idea, including dynamic sparse retrieval, sparse attention mechanisms, and rotating compressive KV cache. The methodology thoroughly builds upon the literature review, referencing concepts like attention-guided context pruning (AttentionRAG), efficient KV cache compression (RazorAttention, PyramidKV), and retrieval-augmented generation approaches. The proposal successfully integrates these elements into a cohesive framework that tackles the challenges identified in both the task description and literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical components are explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations and diagrams. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the significance of the work is well-articulated. The methodology section provides comprehensive explanations of each component (DSR, SQA, RCKV, HOF) with their respective architectures, formulations, and optimization strategies. However, some technical details, particularly in the Sub-Quadratic Sparse Attention section, could benefit from additional clarification on how the cluster-based approach specifically achieves sub-quadratic complexity. Additionally, while the experimental design is well-described, more specific details on implementation challenges and potential solutions would strengthen the clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integrated approach that combines several innovative elements. The Dynamic Sparse Retriever with reinforcement learning optimization offers a fresh perspective on token selection, moving beyond fixed thresholds to adaptive budgeting based on query complexity. The Rotating Compressive KV Cache introduces an innovative importance-weighted rotation mechanism that addresses the unbounded memory growth problem in a unique way. The Hybrid Optimization Framework that jointly optimizes retrieval precision, computational efficiency, and task performance is particularly innovative. While individual components build upon existing work (e.g., AttentionRAG, RazorAttention, PyramidKV), their integration and specific implementations (especially the RL-based retriever and rotating buffer mechanism) represent significant innovations. The proposal goes beyond simply combining existing techniques by introducing new formulations and optimization strategies that address the limitations of current approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations and rigorous methodology. The mathematical formulations for each component are generally well-defined and technically sound. The reinforcement learning approach for optimizing the retriever is well-justified, with appropriate reward functions and optimization techniques. The multi-objective loss function balancing different aspects of performance is thoughtfully designed. However, there are some areas where the technical soundness could be strengthened. The cluster-based attention sparsification claims sub-quadratic complexity, but the precise complexity analysis is not fully elaborated. The reconstruction process in the RCKV component relies on pseudo-inverse matrices, which may introduce numerical instability issues that aren't addressed. Additionally, while the curriculum learning strategy is mentioned, the specific implementation details and theoretical justification for its effectiveness in this context could be more thoroughly developed. Overall, while the approach is generally sound, some technical aspects would benefit from more rigorous analysis and justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach but faces several implementation challenges. The individual components (DSR, SQA, RCKV) are technically implementable, and the datasets and evaluation metrics are well-defined. However, the integration of these components into a unified framework presents significant complexity. The reinforcement learning optimization of the retriever requires careful design of reward functions and training procedures, which may be challenging to tune effectively. The cluster-based attention mechanism may face efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs that are difficult to balance. The rotating buffer mechanism with importance-weighted rotation introduces additional computational overhead that might offset some of the efficiency gains. The multi-objective optimization with four different loss components will likely require extensive hyperparameter tuning to achieve the right balance. Additionally, the proposal doesn't fully address potential computational bottlenecks in the retriever module itself, which could become a new efficiency constraint. While the approach is implementable with sufficient resources and expertise, these challenges make it moderately rather than highly feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in foundation models: enabling efficient processing of long contextual information while maintaining performance. This has significant implications for real-time applications, resource-constrained environments, and domains requiring extensive context understanding. The expected outcomes, including significant reductions in memory usage (70-85%) and computational requirements (50-70% fewer FLOPs), would represent a substantial advancement in the field. The ability to maintain near-constant memory usage and sub-quadratic computational growth as context length increases would be particularly impactful for scaling foundation models to longer contexts. The approach directly addresses the workshop's focus on scalable optimization for efficient and adaptive foundation models. The practical applications in real-time news analysis, customer support, and enterprise knowledge processing demonstrate the broad potential impact. The contribution to addressing fundamental bottlenecks in transformer-based models further enhances its significance. While the proposal builds on existing work, its integrated approach to solving multiple efficiency challenges simultaneously gives it high significance in advancing the field."
