    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on scalable optimization for efficient and adaptive foundation models, particularly targeting long context understanding, sub-quadratic models, and retrieval-augmented generation. The three core modules (Dynamic Sparse Retriever, Sub-Quadratic Sparse Attention, and Rotating Compressive KV Cache) align perfectly with the research idea of integrating dynamic sparse retrieval and compressive KV caching. The proposal builds upon the literature review by addressing limitations in existing approaches like AttentionRAG, GCA, RazorAttention, and PyramidKV, while incorporating their strengths. The mathematical formulations and technical details are consistent with the state-of-the-art approaches mentioned in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical formulations are precise and well-defined, with appropriate mathematical notation and clear explanations of algorithms. The three core modules are explained in detail with their interactions clearly specified. The experimental design section provides concrete details on baselines, hardware, hyperparameter sweeps, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few minor areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact integration mechanism between the retriever and the sparse attention could be more explicitly defined, (2) some technical details about the implementation of the Gumbel-Softmax or stochastic beam sampling for the retriever could be elaborated, and (3) the proposal could more clearly specify how the rotating compressive KV cache interacts with the retrieval policy during inference."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of several cutting-edge techniques in a unified architecture. The key innovations include: (1) the RL-based dynamic sparse retriever that optimizes for both accuracy and computational efficiency, (2) the integration of sparse attention conditioned on retrieved tokens to achieve sub-quadratic scaling, (3) the rotating compressive KV cache using learned low-rank projections, and (4) the joint end-to-end training approach with a hybrid loss function. While individual components build upon existing work (e.g., sparse attention, RAG, KV cache compression), their combination and co-optimization represent a significant advancement. The proposal goes beyond existing approaches like AttentionRAG and PyramidKV by dynamically learning the retrieval policy rather than using fixed heuristics, and by integrating compression, retrieval, and attention mechanisms in a unified framework. The reinforcement learning approach to optimize the retriever for both accuracy and efficiency is particularly innovative."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with appropriate theoretical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for the sparse retriever, sub-quadratic attention, and compressive KV cache are technically correct and build upon established principles. The RL-based optimization approach is well-justified, and the hybrid loss function appropriately balances task accuracy with computational efficiency. However, there are some areas that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the convergence properties of the joint optimization of retrieval policy and model parameters are not thoroughly analyzed, (2) the theoretical guarantees for the sub-quadratic scaling claim (O(n^1.1)) could be more rigorously established, and (3) the potential interactions between the rotating compressive KV cache and the quality of retrieved tokens over time could be more thoroughly examined. Additionally, while the proposal mentions baseline comparisons, a more detailed analysis of how the approach theoretically improves upon these baselines would strengthen the soundness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined components and evaluation metrics. The implementation leverages existing technologies and frameworks, and the experimental design is comprehensive with appropriate baselines and metrics. The hardware requirements (NVIDIA A100 GPUs) are reasonable for this type of research. However, there are several challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) the joint optimization of retrieval policy, attention mechanism, and compression modules may be computationally intensive and potentially unstable, (2) the RL-based training of the retriever might require significant tuning to balance exploration and exploitation effectively, (3) the integration of all components in an end-to-end trainable system could present engineering challenges, and (4) the evaluation on real-time streaming data might require substantial infrastructure setup. While these challenges are not insurmountable, they do represent non-trivial implementation hurdles that could impact the timeline and completeness of the research outcomes."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in foundation model deployment: enabling efficient processing of long contexts while maintaining adaptability to streaming data. The significance is high for several reasons: (1) it directly tackles the quadratic scaling problem of transformer attention, which is a major bottleneck for long-context applications, (2) it provides a unified solution for RAG, KV cache management, and sparse attention, which are typically treated separately, (3) the constant memory usage with fixed-size rotating cache enables processing of arbitrarily long sequences, crucial for real-time applications, (4) the approach is applicable across multiple domains (NLP, vision, multi-modal), increasing its impact potential, and (5) the expected outcomes (2-5Ã— speedup, sub-quadratic scaling, comparable accuracy) would represent a substantial advancement in efficient foundation model deployment. The proposal aligns perfectly with the workshop themes and addresses pressing needs in both research and practical deployment of foundation models."
