    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on scalable optimization for efficient and adaptive foundation models, particularly in the areas of long context understanding, sub-quadratic models, and retrieval-augmented generation. The three main components (dynamic sparse retrieval, sub-quadratic attention, and compressive KV caching) are well-integrated and consistent with the initial research idea. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works like AttentionRAG, GCA, RazorAttention, and PyramidKV while positioning itself as an advancement over these approaches. The experimental design appropriately includes baselines mentioned in the literature review, and the expected outcomes are framed in relation to existing work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is broken down into distinct components with clear mathematical formulations. The algorithm design is detailed with specific equations for the retrieval module, sparse attention mechanism, and compressive KV caching. The experimental design clearly outlines baselines, tasks, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the rotating compressive KV cache with the sparse attention needs more elaboration, (2) the details of how the RL-based retriever is initialized and trained could be more specific, and (3) the relationship between the NewsStreams dataset and the continual adaptation experiments could be more explicitly defined."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents significant novelty in several aspects. The integration of RL-based sparse retrieval with sub-quadratic attention and compressive KV caching represents a novel approach not found in the cited literature. While individual components build upon existing work (e.g., sparse attention from Kitaev et al., PPO from Schulman et al.), their combination and co-optimization is innovative. The rotating low-rank KV cache concept appears to be a novel contribution to address unbounded context retention. The end-to-end optimization framework with a hybrid loss function that balances task accuracy, retrieval cost, and attention sparsity is also innovative. However, some individual techniques (like low-rank projections and sparse attention) are extensions of existing approaches rather than completely new inventions, which prevents the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness with well-defined mathematical formulations and methodological rigor. The RL-based retrieval mechanism is grounded in established reinforcement learning techniques (PPO), and the sparse attention mechanism builds on theoretical foundations with complexity guarantees. The low-rank projection approach for KV cache compression is mathematically sound. However, there are some areas where the theoretical foundations could be strengthened: (1) the claim of O(n log n) complexity needs more rigorous justification, (2) the theoretical guarantees for information preservation in the rotating compressive KV cache are mentioned but not fully developed, and (3) the hybrid loss function's convergence properties and potential trade-offs between competing objectives are not thoroughly analyzed. These gaps, while not critical, prevent the proposal from receiving the highest soundness score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined components and experimental design. The datasets mentioned (passkey retrieval, NewsStreams, NQ, HotpotQA) are appropriate for the tasks, and the evaluation metrics are well-aligned with the research objectives. The baseline comparisons are reasonable and include state-of-the-art methods. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the end-to-end training of the retriever, attention, and cache modules may be computationally intensive and challenging to optimize jointly, (2) the RL-based retrieval mechanism might face training stability issues when integrated with the language model training, (3) the implementation of the rotating compressive KV cache could be complex in practice, especially for maintaining temporal context effectively, and (4) the proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in hyperparameter tuning for the hybrid loss function. These practical implementation challenges somewhat limit the feasibility score."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in foundation models: enabling efficient long-context understanding while maintaining adaptability. The significance is high because: (1) it directly tackles the quadratic complexity bottleneck in transformer attention, which is a fundamental limitation for scaling, (2) it offers a solution for real-time adaptation to streaming data without unbounded memory growth, which has broad applications in news analysis, healthcare, and other domains requiring up-to-date information, (3) it provides a framework that could significantly improve the efficiency of retrieval-augmented generation, making RAG more practical for deployment, and (4) the expected outcomes (70% KV cache reduction, 5Ã— latency improvement, O(n log n) complexity) would represent substantial advances over current methods. The work aligns well with the workshop's goals and has potential for both theoretical contributions and practical impact. However, it doesn't completely revolutionize the field, as it builds upon existing paradigms rather than introducing an entirely new approach."
