        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on scalable optimization for efficient and adaptive foundation models. It directly addresses multiple key topics mentioned in the task description: efficient long context understanding (via compressive KV states), sub-quadratic models, adaptive routing with Mixture of Experts, and retrieval-augmented generation. The proposal specifically targets the challenge of balancing efficiency with contextual adaptability and personalization, which is a central theme of the workshop. The idea also addresses the need for models to handle growing KV caches and perform test-time adaptation, as highlighted in the workshop description. The only minor gap is that while the proposal mentions multimodal workloads as an application, it doesn't deeply explore the specific challenges of multimodal foundation models that the workshop also covers."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The core concept of combining sparse activation (via MoE) with compressive state retention is explained coherently. However, there are some areas that would benefit from further elaboration: (1) The specific mechanism for how the router determines which historical tokens to retain/compress could be more detailed, (2) The reinforcement learning approach for updating the router's policy lacks technical specifics on reward function design and training methodology, and (3) The integration of RAG into the routing process is mentioned but the exact implementation details are somewhat vague. While the overall direction is clear, these technical ambiguities prevent the idea from receiving a higher clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to combining multiple efficiency techniques that are typically treated separately. The integration of adaptive MoE routing with compressive KV states represents a fresh perspective on addressing the efficiency-adaptability trade-off. Particularly innovative is the proposed online router that makes joint decisions about expert activation and historical token compression, creating a unified framework for dynamic resource allocation. The incorporation of RAG into the routing process is also a novel contribution. While individual components (MoE, compressive KV caching, RAG) exist in the literature, their integration into a cohesive framework with joint optimization via reinforcement learning represents a meaningful innovation. The idea doesn't completely reinvent foundation model architecture, but it does propose a novel combination and optimization approach that could advance the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces several implementation challenges that affect its feasibility. First, designing an effective online router that can make real-time decisions about both expert activation and token compression would require sophisticated architecture and training procedures. Second, the reinforcement learning approach for optimizing the router policy across multiple objectives (accuracy, latency, memory) introduces complexity in reward design and training stability. Third, integrating RAG with the routing process adds another layer of complexity. While all components are technically possible with current technology, their integration presents significant engineering and optimization challenges. The proposal would likely require substantial computational resources for experimentation and validation. Additionally, the performance trade-offs between compression and accuracy would need careful empirical validation. The idea is implementable but would require considerable effort and resources to realize fully."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical challenge in foundation model deployment: balancing computational efficiency with adaptability and personalization. If successful, this approach could significantly impact how large language models are deployed in resource-constrained environments and real-time applications. The potential for automated trade-offs between computation/memory costs and performance is particularly valuable for practical applications. The ability to handle long-context, time-sensitive tasks more efficiently would expand the applicability of foundation models to domains requiring real-time analysis of evolving information. The improved throughput for multimodal workloads could also open new application areas. From both academic and practical perspectives, this research could lead to meaningful advancements in making foundation models more accessible and useful in diverse real-world scenarios. The significance is high because it tackles fundamental limitations that currently restrict the deployment of foundation models in many practical settings."
