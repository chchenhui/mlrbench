    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on System-2 reasoning in transformer models and tackles key questions like how to implement such reasoning capabilities, whether they should emerge from training or be explicitly engineered, and how to benchmark generalization while avoiding data contamination. The proposal's core components—Reflection Layers, self-supervised training framework, and procedural benchmarks—are consistent with the research idea of developing emergent System-2 capabilities through self-supervision. The methodology draws appropriately from the literature, incorporating concepts like contrastive learning for logical consistency (Chen & Lee, 2024), curriculum learning (Johnson & Williams, 2023), and meta-learning for reasoning refinement (Brown & Green, 2023). The proposal also addresses the challenge of distinguishing memorization from rule-based learning mentioned in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical details of the ReasonNet architecture are presented with appropriate mathematical formalism, making the approach understandable and implementable. The three-component methodology (architecture, training framework, evaluation) is well-defined, with clear explanations of how each component contributes to the overall goal. The implementation timeline provides a concrete roadmap for the research. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for detecting logical contradictions in the consistency loss could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the number of refinement iterations and computational efficiency could be further elaborated, and (3) some details about the data generation process for the procedural benchmarks could be more specific."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality in several aspects. The Reflection Layers concept, which enables models to evaluate and refine their own reasoning, represents a fresh approach to developing System-2 capabilities. The integration of multiple learning objectives (curriculum, contrastive, and meta-reasoning) into a cohesive framework is innovative. The proposal also introduces novel procedural benchmarks specifically designed to assess genuine reasoning rather than pattern matching. However, some elements build incrementally on existing work: the concept of iterative refinement has similarities to System 2 Attention (Weston & Sukhbaatar, 2023), and the dual-process approach resembles Dualformer (Su et al., 2024). The contrastive learning and curriculum learning components, while well-integrated, are adaptations of established techniques rather than entirely new concepts. The proposal synthesizes and extends existing approaches in a valuable way but doesn't represent a completely revolutionary paradigm shift."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The ReasonNet architecture is well-grounded in transformer technology with clear mathematical formulations for the reflection and refinement mechanisms. The multi-faceted training approach is theoretically sound, combining established techniques (curriculum learning, contrastive learning) with novel meta-reasoning objectives. The evaluation methodology is particularly rigorous, with careful attention to preventing data contamination and distinguishing genuine reasoning from memorization. The implementation plan is systematic and includes appropriate ablation studies to evaluate component contributions. The mathematical formulations for the various loss functions are technically correct and well-justified. One minor limitation is that while the proposal acknowledges the computational challenges of the approach, it doesn't fully address potential optimization issues that might arise from the complex loss function or the iterative refinement process. Additionally, while the proposal discusses the relationship between model scale and reasoning capabilities, it could provide more theoretical justification for why the proposed approach would scale differently than standard transformers."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with a reasonable implementation timeline and clear technical specifications. The architectural modifications to transformer models, while novel, build on established components and techniques, making implementation straightforward for researchers familiar with transformer architectures. The curriculum learning and contrastive learning components have precedents in the literature, suggesting their feasibility. The evaluation methodology, while rigorous, uses established metrics and comparison approaches. However, there are some implementation challenges that could affect feasibility: (1) the computational cost of multiple refinement iterations could be substantial, especially for larger models; (2) designing effective procedural benchmarks that truly test reasoning rather than pattern matching is non-trivial; (3) the complex loss function with multiple components may require careful tuning to avoid optimization difficulties; and (4) detecting logical contradictions automatically for the consistency loss presents technical challenges. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the proposal infeasible—rather, they represent areas requiring careful attention during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical limitation in current AI systems—the lack of robust System-2 reasoning capabilities—which has significant implications for AI safety, trustworthiness, and applicability to complex domains. If successful, ReasonNet would represent an important advancement in developing models with genuine reasoning capabilities rather than mere pattern recognition. The potential impacts outlined in the proposal are substantial and well-justified: enhanced AI safety through more predictable and verifiable reasoning, new applications in fields requiring complex logical analysis, bridging neural and symbolic approaches, and foundational insights for AGI development. The procedural benchmarks and evaluation methodologies would also provide valuable tools for the broader research community. While the proposal may not completely solve the System-2 reasoning challenge, it represents a significant step forward and addresses a problem of fundamental importance to the field. The approach also has the potential to influence future research directions by demonstrating how reasoning capabilities can emerge from appropriately structured neural architectures."
