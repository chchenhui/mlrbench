        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on System-2 reasoning in neural networks. It directly addresses several key questions posed in the task description: it proposes a specific mechanism for implementing System-2 reasoning capabilities in language models, explores whether this should be implemented implicitly inside the model or as an engineered system around it (proposing a hybrid approach), and tackles the challenge of improving reasoning beyond mere memorization. The idea of training models to self-correct by selectively invoking external verification tools is highly relevant to the workshop's interest in integrating neural networks with symbolic reasoning systems."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (incorrect reasoning chains), proposes a specific solution (training with an auxiliary objective to predict correctness of reasoning steps), and outlines the implementation approach (confidence scoring with external tool calls when needed). The training methodology and inference process are both explained concisely. Minor ambiguities exist around the exact implementation details of the confidence scoring mechanism and how the thresholds would be learned, but these are reasonable omissions for a research proposal at this stage."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines several existing concepts in a fresh way. While external tool use, verification of reasoning steps, and confidence estimation are not individually new, the proposal to train models specifically to predict when they need external verification represents a novel approach to self-correction. The integration of internal confidence scoring with selective external verification creates an innovative hybrid approach that mimics human metacognition. However, it builds upon existing work in areas like chain-of-thought reasoning, tool use in LLMs, and uncertainty estimation rather than introducing a completely new paradigm."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach appears largely feasible with current technology. Training models with auxiliary objectives is an established practice, and creating datasets with labeled correctness for reasoning steps is challenging but doable (potentially using stronger models as verifiers). The main implementation challenges would be in developing effective confidence estimation mechanisms that reliably identify reasoning errors and creating appropriate thresholds for tool invocation. The approach would require significant computational resources for training and careful engineering of the external tool interfaces, but these challenges seem surmountable with current methods and technology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical limitation of current LLMs: their tendency to produce plausible but incorrect reasoning. Improving self-correction capabilities could significantly enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of AI systems for high-stakes applications. The approach is particularly significant because it aims to make external verification more efficient by selectively applying it only when needed, potentially offering a practical path to more reliable reasoning without prohibitive computational costs. If successful, this work could advance the field's understanding of how to implement System-2 reasoning capabilities in neural network models and provide a valuable framework for hybrid neural-symbolic approaches."
