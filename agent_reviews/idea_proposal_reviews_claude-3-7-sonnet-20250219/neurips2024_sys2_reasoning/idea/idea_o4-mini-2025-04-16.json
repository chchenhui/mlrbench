        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The ANSRR idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on System-2 reasoning in neural networks. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the task description: it proposes a specific mechanism for implementing System-2 reasoning (a neural-symbolic hybrid approach), discusses where such reasoning should be implemented (partly inside the model via a router, partly in an engineered symbolic system), and mentions benchmarking with 'strict contamination controls' which addresses the data contamination concern. The proposal also touches on the question of whether System-2 reasoning should emerge or be explicitly engineered, suggesting a middle path where the router learns to delegate between neural and symbolic approaches."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (limitations of current transformer models in systematic reasoning), proposes a specific solution (the adaptive neural-symbolic reasoning router), and outlines the implementation approach (RL-trained router that dispatches to either neural or symbolic solvers). The expected outcomes are also clearly stated. However, some technical details could be more precise - for example, how exactly the router determines which subtasks to route where, what specific symbolic solver is used, and how the reinforcement learning reward function balances task accuracy with symbolic tractability. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines neural and symbolic approaches in a novel way through its adaptive routing mechanism. While neural-symbolic integration itself is not new, the dynamic, learned routing of subproblems during generation represents a fresh approach to the problem. The reinforcement learning training of the router to optimize both accuracy and symbolic tractability is also innovative. However, the concept builds upon existing work in neuro-symbolic AI and routing networks, rather than introducing a completely new paradigm. The novelty lies more in the specific implementation and application to System-2 reasoning rather than in creating an entirely new approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Training a router to accurately identify reasoning subtasks is non-trivial, especially for complex problems where the boundaries between subtask types may be fuzzy. The reinforcement learning approach would require careful reward engineering to balance neural flexibility with symbolic precision. Integration of a symbolic solver with a neural decoder in a way that maintains coherent generation is also challenging. While all components (transformers, symbolic solvers, routers) exist separately, their integration as described would require significant engineering effort. The benchmarking with strict contamination controls is feasible but would require careful dataset curation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental limitation in current AI systems - the lack of robust, systematic reasoning capabilities. If successful, it could significantly advance the field by providing a practical approach to combining the strengths of neural and symbolic methods. The potential impacts include improved reliability in safety-critical applications, better interpretability through symbolic reasoning traces, and enhanced generalization to novel problems. The approach could influence how future AI systems are designed, particularly for applications requiring verifiable reasoning. The significance is high because it tackles a core challenge in AI that has implications for both theoretical understanding and practical deployment."
