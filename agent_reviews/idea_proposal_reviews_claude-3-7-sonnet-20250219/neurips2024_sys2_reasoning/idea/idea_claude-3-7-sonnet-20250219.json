        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on System-2 reasoning in neural networks. It directly addresses several key questions posed in the task description: it proposes a specific approach to imbue language models with System-2 reasoning capabilities, suggests that these capabilities should emerge from within the model architecture rather than external systems, presents a different training methodology beyond simple scaling, and even addresses the benchmarking challenge by proposing novel procedural benchmarks with protocols to prevent data contamination. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly discuss whether we 'need' this capability, though it implies its importance for AI safety and trustworthiness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated and understandable. It clearly defines the problem (LLMs' struggle with System-2 thinking), proposes a specific solution (Reflection Layers and a three-part training process), and outlines an evaluation approach. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration. For instance, the exact mechanism of how 'Reflection Layers' work is not fully explained, nor is the specific implementation of the contrastive learning between sound and flawed reasoning paths. The idea of 'explicit rewards for stepwise reasoning' also lacks detail on how these rewards would be defined and implemented. These ambiguities prevent the idea from receiving a higher clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea demonstrates significant originality in its approach to developing System-2 reasoning capabilities. The concept of 'Reflection Layers' that enable self-evaluation and iterative refinement of reasoning appears to be a novel architectural modification. The combination of curriculum learning, contrastive learning between sound and flawed reasoning, and explicit rewards for logical rule-following creates a fresh approach to the problem. What prevents this from scoring higher is that some individual components (curriculum learning, contrastive learning) are established techniques, though their specific application to System-2 reasoning development is innovative. The focus on developing inherent reasoning capabilities within the model's architecture, rather than through external frameworks, also represents a valuable shift in approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate implementation challenges. While the proposed components (curriculum learning, contrastive learning, reward mechanisms) are established techniques in machine learning, implementing effective 'Reflection Layers' that can genuinely evaluate reasoning quality would be technically challenging. Creating a system that can identify logical inconsistencies in its own reasoning requires sophisticated meta-learning capabilities that may be difficult to achieve. Additionally, developing procedural benchmarks that truly assess rule application rather than pattern matching is a significant challenge, as is ensuring no data contamination. The proposal doesn't address computational requirements, which could be substantial given the complexity of the approach. These challenges make the idea somewhat feasible but with considerable implementation hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical limitation in current AI systems - the lack of reliable logical reasoning capabilities. If successful, this approach could significantly advance the field by creating models with genuine System-2 reasoning abilities, which would have profound implications for AI safety, trustworthiness, and applicability across domains requiring logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, and consistent decision-making. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in critical systems where reliable reasoning is essential. The approach also offers a potential path forward beyond simple parameter scaling, which could influence the broader direction of AI research. The significance is particularly high given the growing recognition that current scaling approaches may not inherently solve reasoning limitations."
