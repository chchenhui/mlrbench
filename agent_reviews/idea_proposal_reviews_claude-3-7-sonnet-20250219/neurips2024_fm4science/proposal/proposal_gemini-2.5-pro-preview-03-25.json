        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of 'quantifying the scientific uncertainty of foundation models' mentioned in the task description. The proposal follows the research idea of developing a Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification in scientific foundation models, incorporating all key elements: scalable variational inference, domain-specific priors, calibration metrics, and visualization tools. The methodology thoroughly integrates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works like Psaros et al. (2022) for uncertainty decomposition, White & Green (2023) for scalable inference, and Johnson & Williams (2023) for incorporating domain knowledge. The proposal also addresses all five key challenges identified in the literature review. The only minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions benchmarking across multiple scientific domains, it could have been more specific about which domains from the task description (e.g., astrophysics, biomedicine) would be prioritized."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, problem statement, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly enumerated and well-defined. The technical approach is explained with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the Bayesian framework and variational inference methodology accessible. The experimental design is thoroughly outlined with specific datasets, models, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) The specific SciFM architectures to be used as the foundation for the Bayesian approach could be more clearly defined; (2) The proposal mentions selecting '2-3 diverse scientific domains' but doesn't fully commit to which ones; (3) Some technical details about how the domain-specific priors would be mathematically formulated for different scientific constraints could be more concrete with examples. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity is strong, with logical flow and well-articulated concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty in several aspects. The integration of Bayesian uncertainty quantification with scientific foundation models represents a fresh approach, particularly the emphasis on incorporating domain-specific scientific knowledge as Bayesian priors. The development of science-specific calibration metrics tailored to scientific applications is also innovative. However, many of the individual components build upon existing methods: variational inference for Bayesian neural networks is well-established, and techniques like SVI, the reparameterization trick, and local reparameterization have been applied in other contexts. The proposal acknowledges this by citing relevant prior work. What makes this proposal novel is not revolutionary new algorithms but rather the thoughtful combination and adaptation of existing approaches to the specific challenges of Scientific Foundation Models, with particular attention to scalability and domain knowledge integration. The proposal could have pushed the boundaries further by proposing more innovative inference techniques specifically designed for the unique characteristics of foundation models rather than adapting existing approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The Bayesian framework is mathematically well-formulated, with clear expressions for the variational objective (ELBO) and approaches for incorporating scientific priors. The scalability techniques (SVI, reparameterization trick, local reparameterization) are appropriate for handling large models. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines (deterministic FM, Deep Ensembles, MC Dropout) and evaluation metrics that cover both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quality. The proposal also acknowledges computational challenges and offers potential solutions. The approach to decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components is theoretically sound. However, there are a few areas that could be strengthened: (1) More detailed discussion of the potential limitations of variational inference, which is known to underestimate uncertainty in some cases; (2) More rigorous justification for why the proposed approach would work better than alternatives for SciFMs specifically; (3) More detailed discussion of how the approach would handle multi-modal scientific data. Overall, the technical foundations are solid and well-justified, with only minor gaps."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components, but faces some significant implementation challenges. On the positive side, the methodology builds on established techniques like variational inference that have proven effective in smaller-scale models. The experimental design is well-structured with clear evaluation metrics and baselines. The proposal also acknowledges computational challenges and offers potential solutions like parameter-efficient Bayesian fine-tuning. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) Scaling Bayesian inference to foundation model size remains extremely computationally demanding, and the proposal acknowledges this might require parameter-efficient approaches rather than full Bayesian treatment; (2) Formulating appropriate scientific priors for diverse domains requires deep domain expertise across multiple fields; (3) The proposal aims to address multiple scientific domains, which may be ambitious given the complexity of each domain. The timeline for implementation is not explicitly discussed, which raises questions about how long such comprehensive work would take. While challenging, the research appears feasible with appropriate computational resources and potentially by narrowing the initial focus to one or two scientific domains before expanding."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in the application of foundation models to scientific domains. Uncertainty quantification is essential for scientific applications where understanding confidence in predictions directly impacts decision-making, experimental design, and scientific conclusions. The significance is particularly high because: (1) It directly addresses one of the key challenges identified in the task description ('How to quantify the scientific uncertainty of foundation models?'); (2) It would enable more trustworthy deployment of powerful AI tools in high-stakes scientific applications; (3) The integration of domain knowledge as Bayesian priors could help address another key challenge ('How to align scientific foundation models with scientific facts without hallucination?'); (4) The expected outcomes include open-source software that could benefit the broader scientific community. The proposal clearly articulates how reliable uncertainty quantification would accelerate scientific discovery while maintaining scientific rigor. The impact spans multiple scientific domains and addresses fundamental challenges in AI for Science. The only limitation in significance is that some of the benefits depend on successful scaling of Bayesian methods to foundation model size, which remains challenging."
