        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the challenge of 'How to quantify the scientific uncertainty of foundation models?' which is explicitly mentioned in the Challenges section. The proposal directly tackles the need for reliable uncertainty quantification in scientific applications of foundation models, which is critical for scientific validity and trustworthiness. The idea acknowledges the unique requirements of scientific domains where error quantification is essential, making it highly relevant to the workshop's focus on foundation models for science."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a structured approach with four specific components: (1) variational inference techniques, (2) incorporation of scientific laws as priors, (3) domain-specific calibration metrics, and (4) uncertainty visualization tools. The motivation is well-articulated, and the expected outcomes are clearly stated. The only minor ambiguity is in the technical details of how the variational inference would be implemented at scale, and how exactly scientific laws would be encoded as priors across different domains, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its application of Bayesian methods specifically to scientific foundation models. While Bayesian neural networks and uncertainty quantification are established research areas, the integration of domain-specific scientific constraints as Bayesian priors and the focus on creating uncertainty visualization tools specifically for scientists without ML expertise represent fresh perspectives. The approach is not entirely groundbreaking as it builds upon existing Bayesian methods, but its targeted application to scientific foundation models and the emphasis on making uncertainty interpretable to domain scientists offers meaningful innovation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces some significant challenges. Implementing variational inference techniques that scale to large foundation models is computationally intensive and technically complex. Additionally, incorporating scientific laws as Bayesian priors across multiple scientific domains would require extensive domain expertise and careful formalization. The calibration of uncertainty estimates in complex foundation models is also a known difficult problem. While the individual components have precedents in smaller-scale models, extending them to foundation model scale presents considerable implementation challenges that may require substantial computational resources and interdisciplinary collaboration."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is very high, as reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for the adoption of foundation models in scientific research. The proposal addresses a fundamental gap between the capabilities of foundation models and the rigorous uncertainty requirements of scientific applications. If successful, this work could substantially increase the trustworthiness and utility of AI in scientific discovery across multiple domains. The impact would extend beyond academic interest to practical applications where scientists need to know the confidence levels of model predictions to make informed decisions, especially in high-stakes scenarios like drug discovery, climate modeling, or materials science."
