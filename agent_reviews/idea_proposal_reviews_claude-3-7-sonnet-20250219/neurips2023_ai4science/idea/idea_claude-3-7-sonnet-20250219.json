    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the 'scaling dynamical system modeling to millions of particles' challenge mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposal also incorporates physical insights into AI methods (another explicit topic) through its physics-informed approach. The applications mentioned (molecular dynamics, fluid simulations, plasma physics) match the scientific domains of interest in the task. The only minor reason it's not a perfect 10 is that it doesn't explicitly address how it might connect to some of the other workshop interests like structural biology or black hole visualization, though the approach could potentially be adapted to those domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (computational constraints in modeling complex dynamical systems), the proposed solution (Physics-Informed Neural Network Ensembles with a hierarchical structure), and the expected benefits (physical consistency with less training data). The three-tier architecture is well-defined with base networks for conservation laws, specialized networks for interaction patterns, and a meta-network for orchestration. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as how exactly the differentiable physics modules will be designed and implemented, and how the adaptive resolution techniques will work in practice. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) themselves are not new, but the ensemble approach with hierarchical specialization and the meta-network orchestration layer appears to be an innovative extension. The integration of adaptive resolution techniques with PINNs is also a relatively novel combination. However, the core components (PINNs, ensemble methods, adaptive resolution) are established techniques in the field, which is why the score is not higher. The innovation lies more in the specific combination and application to large-scale particle systems rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithmic concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. The individual components (PINNs, ensemble methods) have been demonstrated in the literature, suggesting basic feasibility. However, scaling to millions of particles while maintaining physical consistency presents substantial computational challenges. The hierarchical structure adds complexity to training and optimization. The meta-network that decides which specialized network to activate introduces another layer of complexity that may be difficult to train effectively. While the adaptive resolution approach is sensible, implementing it efficiently for large-scale systems requires careful algorithm design. The proposal would likely require considerable computational resources and expertise in both physics and deep learning to implement successfully."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is very high. If successful, it would address a fundamental limitation in current scientific computing: the trade-off between physical accuracy and computational scalability. The ability to model millions of particles while maintaining physical consistency would enable breakthroughs across multiple scientific domains mentioned in the proposal (molecular dynamics, fluid simulations, plasma physics). The uncertainty quantification aspect is particularly valuable for scientific applications where understanding confidence bounds is crucial. The potential to accelerate scientific discovery 'by orders of magnitude' as claimed would represent a transformative advance in computational science. The approach directly addresses the workshop's goal of using AI to fundamentally change how scientific discovery is performed."
