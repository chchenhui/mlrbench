        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the 'Accelerating drug discovery pipeline' topic and incorporates 'physical insights to AI methods' by integrating molecular dynamics simulations with reinforcement learning. The proposal also touches on 'molecular modeling and de novo generation' and 'speeding up physical simulators' through the lightweight MD surrogate model. The idea perfectly fits within the workshop's goal of using AI to impact scientific discovery methods, particularly in structural biology and drug discovery."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (physically implausible molecular candidates), proposes a specific solution (RL framework with MD simulation feedback), and outlines expected outcomes (higher proportion of stable molecules, reduced experimental cycles). The technical approach involving gradient updates from reward signals is well-explained. However, some minor details could be further elaborated, such as the specific architecture of the lightweight MD surrogate model and how exactly the adaptive reward balancing would work."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by combining reinforcement learning with molecular dynamics simulations in a closed-loop system. While both RL and MD are established techniques in their respective domains, their integration for de novo molecular generation with real-time physical validation represents a fresh approach. The concept of a lightweight MD surrogate model for rapid feedback is particularly innovative. However, physics-informed neural networks and RL for molecular generation have been explored before, though perhaps not in this specific configuration with MD simulation feedback."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces implementation challenges. Building a reliable MD surrogate model that accurately captures complex molecular physics while being computationally efficient is non-trivial. The computational resources required for running even simplified MD simulations within an RL loop could be substantial. Additionally, defining appropriate reward functions that balance chemical and physical properties effectively requires careful design. While the core components (RL frameworks, MD simulators) exist, their integration at scale presents moderate technical hurdles that would require significant expertise in both computational chemistry and machine learning."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical bottleneck in drug discovery: the high attrition rate of candidate molecules due to physical instability. By incorporating physics-based validation earlier in the discovery pipeline, this approach could significantly reduce wasted resources on synthesizing non-viable molecules. The projected 30-50% reduction in simulation-driven experimental cycles would have substantial economic and time-saving impacts on pharmaceutical research. This work could bridge an important gap between computational chemistry and AI-driven drug discovery, potentially establishing a new paradigm for physics-informed molecular generation."
