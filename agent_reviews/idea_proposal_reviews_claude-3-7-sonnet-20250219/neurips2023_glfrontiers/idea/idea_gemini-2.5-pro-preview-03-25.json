        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description, particularly with the 'Graph/Knowledge enhanced LLMs' topic. The proposal directly addresses how to use structured knowledge (knowledge graphs) to enhance LLM factuality and reasoning capabilities, which is explicitly mentioned as a focus area in the workshop. The iterative framework that combines LLMs with knowledge graphs for improved reasoning and factual accuracy fits perfectly with the workshop's interest in 'using structured knowledge to enhance the capability of LLMs in returning factual... answers.' The idea also touches on the workshop's broader goal of expanding graph learning's impact and demonstrating how graph learning can be a generic tool for understanding structured data."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation clearly identifies the problem (LLMs struggling with complex reasoning and factual accuracy). The main idea articulates a specific approach (iterative framework where LLM collaborates with KG) and explains the process step-by-step (query → reasoning step → graph operation → verification → refinement). The workflow is logical and easy to follow. The only minor ambiguity is in the technical details of how exactly the LLM's hypotheses would be translated into graph operations, and what specific mechanisms would be used to integrate the KG feedback into the LLM's reasoning process. These implementation details would need further elaboration, but the core concept is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by proposing a specific iterative mechanism for LLMs to interact with knowledge graphs. While both retrieval-augmented LLMs and knowledge graphs are established concepts, the proposed approach innovates by creating a feedback loop where the KG actively guides and verifies the LLM's reasoning process step-by-step. This differs from standard retrieval augmentation by leveraging the relational structure of KGs and incorporating verification at each reasoning step. However, similar concepts of iterative reasoning with external knowledge sources have been explored, and the idea builds upon existing work in knowledge-enhanced LLMs rather than introducing a completely new paradigm. The novelty lies in the specific implementation of the graph-guided reasoning process rather than in a fundamentally new concept."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible with current technology and methods. Both LLMs and knowledge graphs are mature technologies, and there are existing methods for translating natural language into graph queries. The iterative framework could be implemented using current prompt engineering techniques and API calls between the LLM and a graph database. The main implementation challenges would be: (1) developing robust methods to translate LLM outputs into precise graph operations, (2) designing effective ways to incorporate graph feedback into the LLM's context window, and (3) ensuring the system can handle complex multi-hop reasoning without exceeding token limits. These challenges are significant but solvable with current technology. The approach would likely require considerable engineering effort to implement effectively, but doesn't require fundamental technological breakthroughs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in current LLM technology: factual accuracy and reliable reasoning. By grounding LLM reasoning in structured knowledge graphs, the approach could significantly reduce hallucinations and improve trustworthiness in knowledge-intensive applications. The potential impact is substantial across multiple domains where factual accuracy is crucial (healthcare, legal, education, scientific research). The approach also contributes to the broader goal of developing more reliable AI systems by combining the strengths of neural and symbolic approaches. The significance is enhanced by the growing importance of LLMs in real-world applications and the increasing concern about their factual reliability. The approach could also advance our understanding of how to effectively combine different AI paradigms (neural language models and symbolic knowledge representations)."
