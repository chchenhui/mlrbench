    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GEM workshop's goal of bridging the gap between generative ML and experimental biology in biomolecular design. The proposal incorporates adaptive experimental design and closed-loop optimization as mentioned in the task topics. It fully implements the main idea of combining generative models with Bayesian optimization for efficient protein engineering, including the specific goal of reducing experimental costs by 80%. The proposal also builds upon the literature review, citing relevant works like Calvanese et al. (2025) on experimental feedback integration, Kouba et al. (2024) and Winnifrith et al. (2023) on generative models, and Lee & Kim (2023) on high-throughput assays. The methodology addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly high false-positive rates, integration of experimental feedback, and balancing exploration/exploitation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate technical details. The adaptive closed-loop framework is explained thoroughly with a clear algorithm (Algorithm 1) that outlines the complete pipeline. Mathematical formulations for the VAE training objective and acquisition function are precisely defined. The experimental design section provides concrete details about case studies, iterations, batch sizes, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for biasing the VAE generation toward functional regions could be more explicitly described, (2) the relationship between the surrogate model and the VAE could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., microfluidic droplet screening) are used without sufficient explanation for non-specialists."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by integrating several existing approaches into a cohesive framework specifically designed for protein engineering. While individual components (VAEs, Bayesian optimization, closed-loop systems) have been explored separately in the literature, their combination with real-time experimental feedback for protein engineering represents a fresh approach. The proposal introduces a novel acquisition function that balances exploration, exploitation, and diversity through a penalty term. However, the core methodological components (VAEs, GPs, Bayesian optimization) are well-established techniques rather than groundbreaking innovations. The proposal builds incrementally on existing work rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The novelty lies primarily in the application context and integration approach rather than in developing new algorithmic foundations."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The VAE formulation is mathematically correct, with a proper ELBO objective function. The Bayesian optimization approach with uncertainty quantification and diversity penalties is theoretically well-grounded. The closed-loop algorithm is logically structured and follows established principles in active learning. The evaluation metrics are appropriate for measuring performance, and the statistical analysis plan using bootstrapping is rigorous. The proposal also acknowledges practical constraints like experimental costs and replication needs. However, there are some minor limitations: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in VAE training with limited protein data, (2) the surrogate model could benefit from more detailed discussion of kernel choice or architecture, and (3) the proposal could more thoroughly discuss potential failure modes or limitations of the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic scope and resource requirements. The experimental design is well-specified with concrete parameters (5 rounds, 50 sequences per round) and clear cost estimates ($12,500 per case study). The methodology leverages established techniques (VAEs, GPs) with existing implementations. The proposal includes practical wet-lab assays (microfluidic droplet screening, yeast display) that are standard in the field. However, several feasibility concerns exist: (1) the timeline for completing 5 rounds of experimental validation is not specified, (2) potential challenges in protein synthesis and characterization are not fully addressed, (3) the computational resources required for model training and updating are not detailed, and (4) the proposal assumes successful integration between computational and experimental workflows without discussing potential coordination challenges. While ambitious, the overall approach appears implementable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in protein engineering with potentially high impact. The closed-loop framework directly tackles the disconnect between computational predictions and experimental validation that currently limits progress in the field. The anticipated outcomes (5× faster discovery, 80% reduction in wet-lab assays) would represent substantial improvements over current approaches. The proposal has immediate practical applications in medicine, industry, and environmental domains through the development of novel functional proteins. The framework is generalizable beyond proteins to other biomolecules and materials, expanding its potential impact. By open-sourcing the pipeline, the proposal aims to enable wider adoption across academic and industrial settings. The work directly addresses the core mission of the GEM workshop by bridging computational and experimental approaches in biomolecular design. The significance is well-justified and aligned with current needs in the field."
