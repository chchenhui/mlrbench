        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Effect of Data' in foundation models, specifically investigating how the number of data passes affects training. The proposal builds upon the literature review's findings on data recycling, overfitting risks, and theoretical frameworks for understanding data repetition in LLM training. The methodology incorporates gradient statistics analysis, loss landscape dynamics, and generalization bounds, which align with the workshop's interest in convergence analysis and generalization for overparametrized models. The proposal comprehensively addresses all aspects of the research idea, including developing a theoretical framework for data recycling, deriving analytic bounds, and proposing adaptive heuristics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented with appropriate mathematical formulations that enhance understanding. The theoretical framework is explained in detail, with clear connections to gradient dynamics, loss landscape evolution, and representation learning. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering dataset construction, model architecture, training protocols, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact implementation details of the adaptive recycling rule could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the theoretical bounds and the practical heuristics could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some of the mathematical notation (e.g., in the adaptive recycling formulation) could be more thoroughly explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for data recycling in LLM pretraining, an area that has been empirically explored but lacks rigorous theoretical understanding. The integration of information geometry with stochastic optimization theory to analyze data repetition effects is innovative. The adaptive data recycling heuristics based on gradient statistics and Fisher information matrix properties represent a fresh approach to optimizing training efficiency. However, some components build incrementally on existing work in optimization theory and generalization bounds. The proposal acknowledges prior work on data recycling (e.g., Doe & Smith, 2023; Blue & Red, 2024) and extends these ideas rather than introducing entirely new concepts. While the combination of methods and their application to the specific problem of data recycling optimization is novel, individual components draw from established theoretical frameworks."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The theoretical framework is built on well-established principles from stochastic optimization, information geometry, and PAC-Bayes theory. The mathematical formulations for gradient statistics analysis, Fisher information matrix, and generalization bounds are correctly presented and appropriately applied to the problem of data recycling. The experimental design includes proper controls, ablation studies, and a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics that address different aspects of model performance. The proposed adaptive recycling rule is grounded in measurable quantities (gradient norm and correlation) and follows a principled approach to balancing accuracy and computational cost. However, there are some assumptions that could benefit from further justification, such as the relationship between Fisher information matrix spectral properties and memorization, and the exact form of the generalization degradation estimate in the adaptive rule."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible research plan with some implementation challenges. The theoretical components (gradient analysis, loss landscape characterization, generalization bounds) are achievable with existing mathematical tools. The experimental design is comprehensive but ambitious, spanning synthetic data to real-world corpora and models from 100M to 10B parameters. This range of experiments would require substantial computational resources, especially for the larger models. The adaptive recycling heuristics can be implemented and tested, though the development of accurate generalization degradation estimates may prove challenging. The proposal acknowledges resource constraints and aims to optimize them, which strengthens its feasibility. However, the comprehensive nature of the experiments across multiple model scales and dataset types may require prioritization or partnership with institutions having access to significant compute resources. The timeline for completing all theoretical and experimental components is not specified, which makes it difficult to fully assess temporal feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in modern machine learning: optimizing the computational and environmental costs of training large language models while maintaining performance. The potential impact is substantial, with the proposal suggesting a 20-40% reduction in compute requirements for equivalent model quality. This would have significant implications for democratizing access to LLM development beyond organizations with massive computational resources. The theoretical contributions would advance understanding of the interplay between data repetition, gradient dynamics, and generalization in overparametrized models, addressing fundamental questions in the field. The practical implications include resource optimization, training stability improvements, and policy guidance for ethical LLM development. The work bridges the gap between theory and practice, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals. While the impact is significant, it focuses on optimizing existing training paradigms rather than introducing transformative new approaches to LLM development."
