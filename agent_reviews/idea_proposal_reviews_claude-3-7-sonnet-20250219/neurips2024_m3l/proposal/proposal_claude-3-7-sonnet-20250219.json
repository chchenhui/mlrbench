    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Effect of Data' in foundation models, specifically investigating how the number of data passes affects training. The proposal expands on the initial idea of developing a theoretical framework for data recycling in LLM pretraining, incorporating all key elements mentioned in the idea (gradient statistics, convergence, generalization, and representation quality). It also builds upon the literature review by addressing the identified challenges of overfitting, balancing efficiency and performance, and the lack of theoretical frameworks. The proposal cites relevant literature like 'Understanding the Impact of Data Repetition on Large Language Models' and extends the concepts discussed in other papers. The methodology section is particularly well-aligned with both the task requirements and research idea, proposing concrete mathematical approaches to model gradient dynamics, information-theoretic approaches, and generalization bounds."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. Research questions are explicitly stated, and the methodology section provides detailed mathematical formulations that specify how the theoretical framework will be developed. The proposal effectively communicates complex concepts using appropriate mathematical notation and algorithmic descriptions. The experimental setup is well-defined, with clear specifications of model architectures, datasets, and metrics to be used. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) Some mathematical formulations, particularly in the information-theoretic approach section, could be more explicitly connected to the practical implications for LLM training; (2) The relationship between the theoretical components (gradient dynamics, information theory, generalization bounds) could be more clearly integrated to show how they form a cohesive framework; (3) The adaptive scheduling algorithm could include more specific details on the stopping criterion function."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel approach to understanding data recycling in LLM pretraining by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework that combines multiple perspectives (optimization theory, information theory, and statistical learning theory). While individual components like gradient analysis or generalization bounds are not entirely new, their integration specifically for analyzing data repetition in LLMs represents a fresh perspective. The proposal extends beyond existing work by attempting to formalize the relationship between epoch counts and various factors like dataset characteristics and model scale. The adaptive epoch scheduling algorithm and data-dependent epoch allocation strategies are innovative contributions. However, some aspects of the proposal build incrementally on existing approaches rather than introducing completely new paradigms. The literature review indicates that some work has already been done on theoretical insights into data recycling, though this proposal aims to provide a more comprehensive and unified framework specifically for LLMs."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for modeling gradient dynamics, information-theoretic approaches, and generalization bounds are well-grounded in established theories from optimization, information theory, and statistical learning. The methodology section provides specific equations and algorithms that appear technically correct and appropriate for the research questions. The empirical validation plan is comprehensive, with appropriate metrics and experimental designs to test the theoretical predictions. The proposal acknowledges the complexity of the problem and approaches it from multiple angles, which strengthens its soundness. The connection to existing literature is well-established, building on prior work in a logical manner. However, some assumptions about the relationship between gradient statistics and generalization could benefit from more explicit justification, and the proposal could more clearly address potential limitations of the theoretical models when applied to extremely large-scale LLMs."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a reasonable research plan, but there are significant challenges to its full implementation. The theoretical components are feasible with appropriate expertise in optimization theory and information theory. However, the empirical validation with models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters would require substantial computational resources that may be beyond the reach of many research groups. Computing the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian for large models is computationally intensive, even with approximation methods like power iteration. The proposal acknowledges computational constraints but doesn't fully address how to overcome them for the largest model sizes. The timeline for completing both the theoretical framework and comprehensive empirical validation is not specified, raising questions about whether all components can be realistically accomplished. The adaptive scheduling algorithm would require multiple training runs to validate, further increasing computational demands. While the core theoretical work and smaller-scale empirical validation are feasible, the full scope as described would be challenging to implement without significant computational resources or partnerships with well-resourced organizations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in modern LLM development: optimizing training efficiency while maintaining model quality. The potential impact is substantial, as even modest improvements in training efficiency could translate to significant reductions in computational costs, energy consumption, and carbon emissions for large-scale models. The theoretical framework would fill an important gap in our understanding of how data repetition affects LLM training, potentially transforming current heuristic-based approaches into more principled methods. The practical guidelines and adaptive scheduling algorithms could be directly applied by practitioners to optimize training regimes. The proposal explicitly addresses the environmental and economic impacts, noting how more efficient training could democratize access to LLM development beyond well-resourced organizations. The work also has potential extensions to other domains like vision models and reinforcement learning. While the significance is high, it's not rated at the highest level because some benefits might be incremental rather than transformative, and the practical adoption of theoretical insights is not guaranteed."
