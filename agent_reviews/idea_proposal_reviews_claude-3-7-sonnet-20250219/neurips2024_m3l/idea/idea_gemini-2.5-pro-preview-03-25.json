        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the workshop's focus on 'Effect of Data' under the 'Intriguing phenomena of foundation models' topic. It directly addresses the question posed in the task description: 'How does the number of data passes affect training, and can we consolidate the empirical and theoretical understanding?' The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for understanding data recycling in LLM pretraining, which is highly relevant to the workshop's goal of providing principled guidance for training large models. However, it doesn't explicitly connect to some other aspects mentioned in the task description, such as the Edge of Stability phenomenon or optimization algorithms, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is exceptionally well-articulated. It clearly defines the problem (understanding the impact of data recycling in LLM pretraining), the approach (developing a theoretical framework using stochastic optimization theory and information geometry), and the expected outcomes (theoretically grounded heuristics for choosing the number of data passes). The proposal uses precise technical language while remaining accessible, and it outlines specific aspects to be studied (gradient statistics, loss landscape dynamics, memorization). The logical flow from motivation to approach to outcomes is seamless, making the idea immediately comprehensible to experts in the field. The only minor limitation is that some technical details about the specific mathematical tools to be employed could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by addressing an understudied aspect of LLM training. While data recycling is a common practice, the proposal correctly identifies that its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood, especially in the context of large language models. The approach of combining stochastic optimization theory with information geometry to analyze this specific problem appears fresh. However, the fundamental concepts being explored (convergence, generalization, representation quality) are well-established areas of study in machine learning theory, and similar theoretical analyses have been conducted for other aspects of deep learning. The novelty lies more in the specific application to data recycling in LLMs rather than in proposing entirely new theoretical frameworks or concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with existing mathematical tools and experimental setups. The theoretical component draws on established fields (stochastic optimization, information geometry) and aims to derive bounds on well-defined quantities. The experimental validation component is reasonable, suggesting controlled experiments on representative architectures rather than requiring full-scale training of the largest LLMs. However, there are significant challenges: developing tight theoretical bounds that actually predict empirical behavior is notoriously difficult in deep learning; the proposed experiments would still require substantial computational resources; and the complex interplay between data repetition, model size, and other factors may prove difficult to disentangle cleanly. These challenges are surmountable but would require considerable expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a highly relevant problem in the era of large language models, where training costs are enormous and optimizing resource allocation is critical. Understanding the optimal number of data passes could lead to significant efficiency gains in LLM training, potentially reducing computational costs and environmental impact. The theoretical insights could also advance our fundamental understanding of how these models learn from data. The significance extends beyond just practical guidelines, as it could reveal deeper principles about generalization and representation learning in overparameterized models. The impact would be felt across both academic research and industrial applications of LLMs, though it might not revolutionize the field as dramatically as some other potential breakthroughs in AI theory."
