        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice,' specifically addressing the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon that is explicitly mentioned in the task description. The proposal directly tackles the question of 'How do optimization methods minimize training losses despite large learning rates and large gradient noise?' and explores 'Continuous approximations of training trajectories' through SDEs, both of which are core topics in the workshop. The idea also connects to practical hyperparameter tuning challenges mentioned in the introduction of the task description, promising to replace trial-and-error approaches with principled guidelines."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a specific problem (Edge of Stability), a proposed approach (modeling discrete-time gradient methods as continuous SDEs with curvature-aware drift terms), and expected outcomes (quantifying EoS and suggesting tailored learning rate schedules). The mathematical framework involving Fokker-Planck equations provides a concrete methodology. The only minor ambiguities lie in the details of how the Hessian-weighted correction is specifically incorporated and how the validation on 'mid-sized Transformers' would be conducted, which would benefit from further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. While stochastic differential equations and Fokker-Planck equations have been used in optimization theory before, the specific incorporation of curvature-aware drift terms to explain the Edge of Stability phenomenon represents an innovative approach. The extension to adaptive optimizers like Adam by embedding preconditioning into the SDE framework also adds novelty. However, the core mathematical tools (SDEs, Fokker-Planck) are established in the field, and similar continuous approximations of discrete optimizers have been explored, though perhaps not with this specific focus on EoS."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with existing mathematical tools and computational resources. The theoretical framework builds on well-established differential equations and stochastic processes. The validation on toy models is straightforward, and testing on mid-sized Transformers is realistic. However, there are moderate challenges: accurately computing Hessian information for large models can be computationally expensive, and the extension to adaptive optimizers may introduce additional complexity. The proposal acknowledges these practical aspects by focusing on mid-sized rather than the largest models, suggesting awareness of computational constraints."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a significant problem in deep learning optimization theory with potentially high impact. Understanding the Edge of Stability phenomenon could bridge a major gap between theory and practice in deep learning optimization. As the task description emphasizes, 'trial and error with billion- or trillion-size models can result in enormous costs,' making principled approaches to hyperparameter selection extremely valuable. If successful, this work could lead to substantial computational savings in large-scale model training and provide theoretical insights that guide practical training procedures. The significance is particularly high given the increasing scale of models and the corresponding computational costs."
