        "justification": "The Dynamic Context Windows (DCW) idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Applications: long-context, multi-round and personalized instruction-following models' topic. It directly tackles the challenge of improving instruction following in long-text scenarios, which is a core focus of the task. The proposal also touches on 'Modeling' aspects by suggesting algorithms for learning from instructions with adaptive attention mechanisms, and 'Training and inference efficiency' by optimizing computational resource allocation. The hierarchical importance zones based on instruction semantics directly addresses personalized instruction-following capabilities."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, proposed solution, and implementation approach. The two-phase architecture is explained concisely - first identifying critical segments based on instruction relevance, then allocating computational resources accordingly. The motivation and potential applications are well-defined. However, some minor ambiguities exist around the specific mechanisms for determining 'hierarchical importance zones' and how exactly the sparse attention patterns would be implemented. Additional technical details on the lightweight classifier and the exact nature of the specialized datasets would make the idea even clearer."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by proposing an adaptive attention mechanism specifically tailored to instruction semantics. While attention mechanisms and sparse attention are not new concepts in transformer architectures, the instruction-driven dynamic segmentation of context windows represents a fresh approach to the long-context problem. The hierarchical importance zones based on instruction relevance is an innovative concept. However, the approach builds upon existing work in sparse attention and efficient transformers rather than introducing a completely new paradigm. The novelty lies in the application and combination of these techniques specifically for instruction-following in long-text scenarios."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The two-phase architecture could be implemented using existing transformer models with modifications to attention mechanisms. Creating specialized datasets for fine-tuning is a practical approach. However, there are implementation challenges to consider: (1) designing an effective lightweight classifier that can accurately identify critical segments without significant computational overhead, (2) balancing the trade-off between computational efficiency and maintaining sufficient context awareness, and (3) creating high-quality training data that effectively captures diverse instruction-following scenarios across varying document lengths. These challenges are substantial but not insurmountable with current techniques."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant limitation in current LLMs - their inefficiency and degraded performance when processing very long texts. The potential impact is considerable across multiple domains including legal document analysis, literature review, and research tasks that require comprehensive understanding of extensive documents. If successful, DCW could enable more efficient and effective instruction following for long documents, potentially reducing computational costs while improving performance. This would expand the practical applications of LLMs in professional and academic settings where document length is a current barrier. The dual focus on both effectiveness and efficiency makes this research particularly valuable for real-world applications."
