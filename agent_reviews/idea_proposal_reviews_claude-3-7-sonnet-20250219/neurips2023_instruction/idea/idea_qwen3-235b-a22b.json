    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description. It directly addresses the 'Evaluation and Oversight' topic by proposing formal verification methods to enforce guardrails and guarantees for model behaviors. It also covers 'Limitations, Risks and Safety' by focusing on safety concerns in instruction-following models. The multimodal aspect of the proposal matches the 'Multimodal and Multidisciplinary' topic. The idea specifically targets hallucination reduction, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description. The only minor gap is that it doesn't extensively address the data collection or engineering aspects mentioned in the task description, though these could be implicit in the implementation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (safety vulnerabilities in instruction-following models), the proposed solution (a hybrid framework combining formal verification and adversarial training), and expected outcomes (improved robustness, formal guarantees, and open-source tools). The methodology is well-defined, mentioning specific techniques like abstract interpretation and multi-modal perturbation. However, some technical details could be further elaborated - for instance, how exactly the formal specifications will be translated into differentiable soft penalties, or what specific symbolic logic formalism will be used. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to safety certification for instruction-following models. The combination of formal verification with adversarial training specifically for multi-modal LLMs represents a fresh perspective. While both formal verification and adversarial training are established techniques in ML safety, their integration for instruction-following models, particularly in a multi-modal context, appears innovative. However, each individual component (formal verification, adversarial training, interpretable auditing) has precedents in the literature. The novelty lies more in the specific application domain and the integration of these techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methods, which is why it doesn't receive a higher score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several significant challenges. Formal verification of neural networks, especially large-scale models like LLMs, remains computationally intensive and often limited to simplified properties. Translating ethical constraints into formal specifications is conceptually difficult and potentially subjective. The adversarial training component is more feasible, but generating meaningful adversarial examples across multiple modalities adds complexity. The 20% reduction in hallucination errors seems optimistic given the current state of the art. While the individual components have been demonstrated in simpler settings, scaling them to multi-modal LLMs presents substantial technical hurdles. The idea is implementable but would require considerable resources and may need to be scoped to specific constraints or domains to be fully realized."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is exceptionally high. As instruction-following models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains like healthcare and autonomous systems, ensuring their safety and robustness becomes paramount. The proposed framework addresses a critical gap in current approaches by providing formal guarantees rather than just empirical improvements. If successful, this work could establish new standards for certifying AI systems before deployment in high-risk applications. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to industry adoption and possibly regulatory frameworks. The focus on multi-modal settings is particularly timely as these systems become more prevalent. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's commitment to open-sourcing tools, which could accelerate progress across the field."
