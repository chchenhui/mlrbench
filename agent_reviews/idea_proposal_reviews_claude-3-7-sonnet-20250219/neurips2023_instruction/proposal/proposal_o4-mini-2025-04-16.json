    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of instruction following over long documents, which falls under the 'Applications' topic in the task description (specifically 'long-context instruction-following models'). The proposal implements the exact concept outlined in the research idea of 'Dynamic Context Windows' that adaptively adjusts attention based on instruction relevance. The methodology builds upon and extends the literature review's findings on efficient transformers and long-context models (e.g., LongLoRA, Core Context Aware Attention). The proposal's two-phase architecture with a lightweight classifier followed by adaptive attention directly implements the approach described in the idea. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions challenges in generalizing across tasks, the proposal could have more explicitly addressed how DCW handles this specific challenge."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical flow with appropriate technical detail. The algorithmic steps are provided in clear pseudocode, and the mathematical formulations of the attention mechanism are precise. The experimental design section thoroughly outlines baselines, datasets, metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for training the CRC on 'human-annotated relevance labels or silver labels derived via exact-match heuristics' could be more detailed, (2) The process for determining the optimal values of hyperparameters like τ_high and τ_low could be more explicitly described, and (3) The proposal could more clearly explain how the system handles dependencies between distant but related segments that might both be relevant to the instruction."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a novel approach to handling long-context instruction following. The Dynamic Context Windows framework, particularly its instruction-driven relevance classification and hierarchical attention allocation, represents a fresh perspective on the problem. The combination of a lightweight classifier with a fine-tuned LLM architecture is innovative. However, the core mechanisms build upon existing approaches in the literature: the attention masking technique resembles those in Longformer and Core Context Aware Attention, while the efficiency improvements leverage ideas similar to LongLoRA. The proposal extends rather than fundamentally reimagines these approaches. The novelty lies primarily in the instruction-specific adaptation of attention patterns and the hierarchical relevance zones, which are meaningful innovations but not entirely groundbreaking in the context of existing sparse attention mechanisms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-defined methodologies and rigorous formulations. The mathematical framework for the Context Relevance Classifier and Dynamic Attention Mechanism is clearly presented with proper notation and formulas. The approach builds logically on established techniques like LoRA fine-tuning and transformer attention mechanisms. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The proposal also acknowledges efficiency considerations and provides concrete metrics for evaluation. The training methodology with alternating CRC and DA-LLM steps is well-justified. However, there are some minor gaps: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address potential issues with attention dilution even within relevant segments, (2) There's limited discussion of how the model handles conflicting relevance signals when instructions have multiple components, and (3) The theoretical justification for why the specific attention mask formula with the three-tier approach (1, α, β) would be optimal could be strengthened."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly feasible approach with realistic implementation paths. It builds on established models (Llama2-7B) and techniques (LoRA adapters) that are widely available and well-documented. The computational efficiency gains through sparse attention are well-founded and likely achievable. The data requirements leverage existing benchmarks (GovReport, Qasper, MultiDoc2Dial) supplemented with synthetic data, which is a practical approach. The two-phase architecture allows for modular development and testing. The use of LoRA adapters specifically addresses GPU memory constraints during fine-tuning. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) The human annotation of relevance labels for training the CRC could be resource-intensive, though the proposal does mention silver labels as an alternative, (2) The joint training procedure might require careful balancing to prevent oscillations between CRC and DA-LLM optimization, and (3) While the proposal targets documents up to 100k tokens, testing at this scale would require substantial computational resources, though still within reach of research labs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in the field of large language models: efficiently processing and reasoning over very long documents while following instructions. The significance is substantial for several reasons: (1) It could enable practical applications in domains requiring long-context understanding, such as legal document analysis, scientific literature review, and multi-document summarization, (2) The projected 30-50% reduction in GPU memory and 2× higher throughput would democratize access to long-context LLMs for smaller organizations and researchers with limited computational resources, (3) The expected 5-10% performance improvement would represent a meaningful advance in state-of-the-art capabilities, (4) The approach enhances interpretability by making explicit which parts of documents the model focuses on, addressing an important concern in AI safety, and (5) The commitment to open-source release would benefit the broader research community. The proposal directly addresses limitations in current instruction-following models that restrict their applicability in real-world scenarios requiring comprehensive document understanding."
