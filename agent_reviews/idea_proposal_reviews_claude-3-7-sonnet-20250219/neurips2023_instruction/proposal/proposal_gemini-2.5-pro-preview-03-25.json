    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of efficient long-context processing in instruction-following LLMs, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description under 'Applications: long-context, multi-round and personalized instruction-following models.' The Dynamic Context Windows (DCW) framework elaborates comprehensively on the initial idea, maintaining the core concept of adaptively adjusting attention based on instruction relevance. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing and building upon works like Longformer, LongLoRA, and various efficient attention mechanisms. It addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly computational complexity and attention mechanism limitations. The only minor inconsistency is that while the idea mentioned hierarchical importance zones, the proposal uses a simpler two-level (high/low relevance) approach with an intermediate zone, which is a reasonable simplification."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail, with formal mathematical notation to describe the attention mechanisms and clear explanations of how the DCW framework modifies standard attention. The two-phase architecture (Instruction-Relevance Assessment and Adaptive Attention Allocation) is well-defined, with multiple implementation options presented. The experimental design section provides comprehensive details on tasks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the relevance predictor with the main LLM during inference could be more precisely specified, (2) the training procedure for the relevance predictor could be more detailed, especially if it's trained jointly with the main model, and (3) the proposal mentions 'multi-document analysis' tasks but doesn't fully elaborate on how DCW would handle multiple documents simultaneously."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The DCW framework presents a novel approach to long-context processing by explicitly making attention allocation instruction-dependent. While existing methods like Longformer, Reformer, and Linformer offer efficient attention mechanisms, they typically employ static patterns or are input-driven rather than instruction-driven. The proposal's innovation lies in dynamically identifying text segments relevant to the specific instruction and allocating computational resources accordingly. This instruction-specific adaptation distinguishes it from prior work like Adaptive Attention Span, which learns per-token spans independent of task instructions. However, the novelty is somewhat tempered by the fact that the individual components (relevance assessment, sparse attention patterns) build heavily on existing techniques. The proposal combines these techniques in a new way rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. Additionally, the concept of using auxiliary models to guide attention is not entirely new, though applying it specifically to instruction-following in long contexts represents a fresh application."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The DCW framework is built on well-established attention mechanisms with clear mathematical formulations. The adaptation of standard self-attention to incorporate instruction-specific relevance is technically sound, with proper consideration of how to modify the attention computation. The two-phase architecture is well-justified, with multiple implementation options that address potential challenges. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. The proposal also acknowledges potential risks and limitations, such as relevance prediction errors and data dependency, and offers mitigation strategies. The technical formulations are correct and clearly presented. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further theoretical analysis: (1) the theoretical guarantees or bounds on computational savings could be more rigorously established, (2) the potential impact of relevance prediction errors on model performance could be more formally analyzed, and (3) the proposal could more explicitly address how DCW handles cases where relevance is distributed throughout the document rather than concentrated in specific segments."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The DCW framework is generally feasible with current technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The proposal wisely builds on existing open-source LLMs and efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA/LongLoRA, which increases practicality. The use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning is appropriate given the computational constraints of working with large models. The data collection strategy combining curation, synthetic generation, and human validation is reasonable and addresses the need for specialized training data. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Training the relevance predictor alongside the main LLM may be complex and resource-intensive, especially if it requires significant architectural modifications; (2) Creating high-quality relevance annotations at scale could be challenging and expensive; (3) The proposal acknowledges the complexity of implementing the two-phase architecture but doesn't fully detail how to overcome this; (4) The computational overhead of the relevance assessment phase during inference might partially offset the efficiency gains from sparse attention. While these challenges don't render the approach impractical, they do suggest that significant engineering effort would be required for successful implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The DCW framework addresses a critical limitation in current LLMs - the inefficient processing of long contexts - which has substantial implications for numerous applications. If successful, this research could significantly advance the state-of-the-art in long-text instruction following, enabling more efficient and effective processing of documents like legal contracts, research papers, and technical manuals. The expected outcomes include both effectiveness improvements (5-15% on accuracy/ROUGE scores) and efficiency gains (30-60% reduction in computational costs), which would represent meaningful progress. The potential applications span multiple high-value domains including law, medicine, finance, and research, where extracting specific information from lengthy documents is crucial. The proposal also contributes to the broader goal of making large-scale AI more energy-efficient and accessible. The open-source nature of the planned implementation aligns with the workshop's theme of openness and reproducibility. While the significance is high, it falls short of transformative as the approach represents an important incremental advance rather than a paradigm shift in how LLMs process information."
