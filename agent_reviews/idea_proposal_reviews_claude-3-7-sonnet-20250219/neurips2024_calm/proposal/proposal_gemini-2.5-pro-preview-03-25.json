    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of improving LLM robustness through counterfactually guided fine-tuning, which falls under the 'Causality for large models' topic identified in the task description. The proposal incorporates the core idea of using counterfactual pairs to steer models away from spurious correlations toward causal mechanisms. It thoroughly references and builds upon the literature review, citing many of the same papers and addressing the key challenges identified (spurious correlation identification, counterfactual generation, generalization, computational complexity, and evaluation metrics). The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposed approach will tackle these challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research questions and goals are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described in detail with concrete examples and mathematical formulations. The counterfactual generation process and fine-tuning methodology are explained thoroughly. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, with specific datasets, baselines, and metrics identified. The only minor issues preventing a perfect score are: (1) some technical details in the counterfactual loss function could be further elaborated, particularly the alternative formulations briefly mentioned, and (2) there's a small inconsistency in the methodology section numbering (Step 1, Step 3, Step 4, Step 5, with Step 2 missing)."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel integration of counterfactual reasoning with LLM fine-tuning, particularly in its systematic approach to generating and utilizing counterfactual pairs. While individual components (counterfactual data augmentation, fine-tuning for robustness) have been explored in prior work cited in the literature review, the proposal innovates by: (1) developing a semi-automated approach for generating high-quality counterfactual text pairs based on simplified causal graphs, (2) introducing a specific counterfactual consistency loss function for fine-tuning, and (3) applying this framework comprehensively across multiple text classification tasks. However, it builds substantially on existing work in counterfactual data augmentation (e.g., Doe & Smith, 2023) and causal fine-tuning (e.g., Brown & Green, 2024), which limits its groundbreaking nature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations in causal inference and machine learning. The counterfactually guided fine-tuning approach is well-grounded in structural causal models and clearly articulates how interventions on causal versus spurious features should affect model predictions. The methodology is rigorous, with a well-defined loss function and training procedure. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including appropriate datasets, baselines, and metrics to assess both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness. The proposal acknowledges potential limitations and includes ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components. The only aspects preventing a perfect score are: (1) some simplifying assumptions about the ability to clearly identify causal vs. spurious features in text, which may be challenging in practice, and (2) limited discussion of potential failure modes if the assumed causal structures are incorrect."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable scope. The datasets mentioned (BiosBias, SNLI/MNLI, Jigsaw) are publicly available, and the proposed model architectures (fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs) are standard practice. The semi-automated counterfactual generation approach is practical, combining template-based and LLM-assisted methods. However, several challenges affect the feasibility score: (1) The quality of LLM-generated counterfactuals may vary and require significant human verification, potentially creating a bottleneck; (2) The computational resources required for fine-tuning large models with the proposed loss function could be substantial; (3) Identifying clear causal and spurious features in complex text may be more difficult than presented, especially for tasks beyond the simplified examples given; and (4) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address how to handle cases where the causal structure is ambiguous or contested."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in AI trustworthiness: making LLMs more robust to distribution shifts by reducing reliance on spurious correlations. This has significant implications for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and policy-making, as mentioned in the task description. The research could lead to more reliable and fair AI systems by mitigating biases associated with demographic attributes. The proposal's significance is enhanced by its practical methodology that could be adopted by practitioners to improve deployed systems. It also contributes to the theoretical understanding of how causal principles can be operationalized in deep learning. The score is not higher because: (1) the approach focuses on specific text classification tasks rather than more complex generative capabilities of LLMs, potentially limiting broader impact, and (2) while important, similar goals are being pursued by multiple research groups, as evidenced in the literature review."
