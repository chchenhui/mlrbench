    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of improving large language models' robustness by focusing on causal relationships rather than spurious correlations, which is central to the task's concern about trustworthiness and reliability of large models. The methodology thoroughly implements the counterfactually guided fine-tuning approach outlined in the research idea, with detailed procedures for identifying spurious correlations, generating counterfactual pairs, and fine-tuning models. The proposal also incorporates insights from the literature review, particularly building on works like 'Counterfactual Data Augmentation for Mitigating Spurious Correlations' and 'Fine-tuning Large Language Models with Counterfactual Examples for Fairness'. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions computational complexity as a key challenge, the proposal doesn't thoroughly address computational efficiency considerations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical, step-by-step manner with appropriate mathematical formulations. The four phases of the methodology (spurious correlation identification, counterfactual pair generation, counterfactually guided fine-tuning, and evaluation) are thoroughly explained with specific techniques, formulas, and implementation details. The expected outcomes and broader impact are also clearly delineated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact procedure for constructing causal graphs could be more detailed, (2) some of the mathematical notations (e.g., in the quantification of spuriousness) could be further explained for broader accessibility, and (3) the specific datasets to be used in the evaluation could be more explicitly identified."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating causal reasoning principles with LLM fine-tuning in a systematic way. The counterfactual consistency loss function and the three-pronged approach to generating counterfactual pairs (template-based, LLM-based, and controlled text generation) represent innovative contributions. The comprehensive evaluation framework, particularly the Causal Robustness Ratio metric, is also a novel addition. However, the core idea of using counterfactual examples for fine-tuning builds upon existing work mentioned in the literature review (papers 5 and 6), and the general approach of applying causality to improve model robustness has been explored in several cited papers. The proposal extends and systematizes these ideas rather than introducing a completely new paradigm. The novelty lies more in the comprehensive integration and systematic application rather than in fundamentally new concepts."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The mathematical formulations for spurious correlation identification, counterfactual generation, and the counterfactual consistency loss are theoretically grounded in causal inference principles. The training protocol is detailed with specific hyperparameters and optimization strategies. The evaluation framework is comprehensive, covering in-distribution performance, out-of-distribution generalization, fairness, and causal reasoning. The proposal also includes ablation studies to assess component contributions. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the approach: (1) the causal graph construction relies heavily on domain knowledge without specifying how to validate these graphs, (2) the counterfactual generation methods could benefit from more formal guarantees about the quality and validity of the generated examples, and (3) the assumption that the identified spurious correlations can be cleanly separated from causal factors may not always hold in complex real-world scenarios."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally feasible with current technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The use of existing LLMs as base models and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (LoRA) is practical and resource-efficient. The counterfactual generation methods, particularly the LLM-based approach, leverage available technologies. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Accurately identifying spurious correlations in complex domains requires significant domain expertise and may be subjective; (2) Generating high-quality counterfactual pairs that preserve semantic meaning while altering only spurious features is challenging and may require substantial manual verification; (3) The evaluation metrics, particularly for causal reasoning assessment, may require specialized datasets that aren't readily available; (4) The computational resources needed for fine-tuning multiple large models and conducting comprehensive evaluations could be substantial. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present significant hurdles that would require careful planning and potentially additional resources to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI development: the tendency of large language models to rely on spurious correlations rather than causal relationships. This issue directly impacts model robustness, fairness, and reliability in real-world applications. By developing methods to steer models toward learning causal mechanisms, the research could significantly advance trustworthy AI, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal services, and financial decision-making where reliability is paramount. The expected outcomes—15-25% improvement in out-of-distribution performance and 10-20% improvement in causal reasoning benchmarks—would represent substantial progress. The broader impact extends beyond the specific technical contributions to advancing the integration of causal reasoning in deep learning systems, enhancing model fairness, improving domain adaptation, and providing educational resources for practitioners. The significance is further amplified by the growing deployment of LLMs in critical applications where robustness to distribution shifts and fairness across demographic groups are essential requirements."
