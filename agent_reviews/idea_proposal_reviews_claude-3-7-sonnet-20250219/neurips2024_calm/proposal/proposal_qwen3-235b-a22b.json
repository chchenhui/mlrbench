    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Causality for large models' by proposing a counterfactually-guided fine-tuning approach to improve LLM robustness. The methodology clearly builds upon the literature review's findings about LLMs struggling with causal reasoning (Jin et al., 2023; Kıcıman et al., 2023) and vulnerability to spurious correlations (White & Black, 2024). The proposal incorporates counterfactual data augmentation techniques mentioned in the literature (Doe & Smith, 2023; Johnson & Lee, 2023) and extends them into a comprehensive fine-tuning framework. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets and evaluation metrics that align with the task's emphasis on trustworthiness and reliability in high-stakes domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The causal graph specification, counterfactual pair generation methods, and learning framework are all thoroughly explained. The experimental design includes well-defined metrics and baselines. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for automating counterfactual generation could be more precisely defined, particularly for complex scenarios; (2) the relationship between the causal graph and the actual fine-tuning process could be more explicitly connected; and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'structural Hamming distance') are used without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with causal inference terminology."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating counterfactual reasoning directly into the fine-tuning process for LLMs. While individual components draw from existing work (counterfactual data augmentation, consistency losses), the comprehensive framework that combines causal graph specification, automated counterfactual generation, and a two-phase curriculum training approach represents a fresh synthesis. The proposal's novelty lies in systematically bridging causality and LLMs through a practical fine-tuning methodology rather than just evaluation. However, it builds significantly on prior work mentioned in the literature review (particularly Doe & Smith, 2023 and Johnson & Lee, 2023), and the counterfactual consistency loss bears similarities to existing contrastive learning approaches. The two-step curriculum training strategy offers some innovation, but the core techniques are extensions rather than fundamentally new approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is grounded in causal inference principles with appropriate mathematical formulations for the counterfactual consistency loss and optimization strategy. The causal graph specification provides a solid theoretical framework, and the connection between spurious correlations and model robustness is well-established. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines (standard fine-tuning, domain-adversarial training, invariant risk minimization) and comprehensive evaluation metrics that address both performance and fairness. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the effects of different components. The two-phase curriculum training approach is theoretically justified. However, there are some minor concerns: (1) the assumption that counterfactual pairs can be reliably generated for complex language tasks may need further validation; (2) the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach; and (3) the causal faithfulness metric requires ground truth DAGs which may not always be available in real-world scenarios."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The use of established LLMs (e.g., Llama-7B) and standard datasets (IMDb, AG News, Bios, CivilComments) is practical. The rule-based templates for counterfactual generation are straightforward to implement for simpler cases. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Generating high-quality counterfactuals for complex language tasks is non-trivial and may require significant manual effort or sophisticated generative models; (2) The computational resources required for fine-tuning large models like Llama-7B with additional counterfactual pairs could be substantial; (3) Constructing accurate causal graphs for real-world datasets requires domain expertise and may involve subjective judgments; (4) The two-phase curriculum training adds complexity to the implementation. While these challenges don't render the proposal impractical, they do suggest that successful execution will require careful planning, sufficient computational resources, and potentially some scope adjustments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety and trustworthiness: making LLMs more robust to distribution shifts and less reliant on spurious correlations. This has significant implications for deploying these models in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and legal systems. The expected outcomes include substantial improvements in out-of-distribution accuracy (≥15%) and fairness metrics (≥40% reduction in bias), which would represent meaningful progress. The work bridges theoretical causality with practical LLM fine-tuning, potentially influencing future model development. The broader impact section convincingly argues for applications in safety-critical domains and contributions to theoretical understanding. The proposal directly addresses multiple directions from the workshop description, particularly 'Causality for large models' and 'Causality in large models.' While the impact may not be transformative of the entire field, it represents a significant step forward in an important research direction with clear practical applications."
