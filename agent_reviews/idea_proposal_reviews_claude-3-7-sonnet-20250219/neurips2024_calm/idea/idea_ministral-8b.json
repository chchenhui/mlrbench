    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task description, particularly addressing the question (B) about trustworthiness of large models. It directly tackles the challenge of making 'black box' models more reliable and interpretable through causal inference. The proposal covers two of the four main directions mentioned in the task: 'Causality in large models' (through causal knowledge assessment) and 'Causality of large models' (through interpretability and controllability). However, it doesn't fully address 'Causality with large models' (using large models to improve causal inference), which is why it doesn't receive a perfect score."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The three-part methodology (assessment, augmentation, and interpretability) provides a good framework. However, there are some ambiguities that could be clarified: the specific causal inference techniques to be used aren't detailed, the metrics for evaluating causal knowledge aren't specified, and the exact mechanisms for causal augmentation remain somewhat abstract. More concrete examples or specific methodological approaches would enhance clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The integration of causal inference with large models represents a relatively novel approach to addressing trustworthiness issues. While both causal inference and large model research exist separately, their systematic combination as proposed here offers fresh perspectives. The idea of developing specific metrics for causal knowledge assessment in large models and using causal structures for interpretability are particularly innovative aspects. However, some elements like using causal reasoning for robustness have been explored in other contexts, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces significant feasibility challenges. Causal inference typically requires strong assumptions and controlled environments, which are difficult to establish in the context of large, complex models trained on diverse data. Developing meaningful causal metrics for these models and identifying causal structures within them are technically challenging tasks that may require substantial methodological innovations. The proposal doesn't address how to overcome the computational complexity of applying causal inference at scale. While not impossible, these challenges suggest moderate feasibility that would require considerable resources and methodological advances."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is very high. Trustworthiness and reliability of large models are critical concerns, especially as these models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains. If successful, this research could fundamentally transform how we understand, evaluate, and improve large models, addressing one of the most pressing challenges in AI today. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in healthcare, policy-making, and other safety-critical domains where reliable AI systems are essential. The combination of theoretical rigor from causality with the practical power of large models could lead to major advancements in responsible AI."
