    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of incorporating behavioral science insights into AI systems, specifically focusing on alignment, evaluation, and computational cognitive science topics. The proposal builds upon the research idea by developing a framework that uses cognitive architectures (ACT-R, CLARION) to guide LLM training and inference, with the hybrid training objective and constrained decoding mechanism as specified. It thoroughly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, including alignment of cognitive models with LLMs, scalability, evaluation metrics, generalization, and balancing performance with interpretability. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposal will integrate cognitive architectures with LLMs, which is consistent with the approaches discussed in the literature review papers."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The hybrid training framework, constrained decoding mechanism, and evaluation metrics are all well-defined. The proposal uses appropriate technical language while remaining accessible. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mapping between cognitive model states and LLM attention patterns could be more precisely defined, (2) the implementation details of the cognitive state tracker during inference could be elaborated, and (3) the proposal could more explicitly describe how the cognitive architectures will be computationally implemented and integrated with the LLM training pipeline."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to integrating cognitive architectures with LLMs. While the literature review shows that similar ideas have been explored (e.g., CoALA, LLM-ACTR), this proposal introduces several innovative elements: (1) the hybrid training objective that combines language modeling loss with cognitive alignment loss, (2) the specific formulation of trace matching and step consistency components, (3) the constrained decoding mechanism with a cognitive state tracker, and (4) the comprehensive evaluation framework. However, the core concept of integrating cognitive architectures with LLMs is not entirely new, as evidenced by the literature review. The proposal builds upon existing work rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, which is why it scores a 7 rather than higher. The innovation lies more in the specific implementation details and comprehensive framework rather than in the fundamental concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in both cognitive science and machine learning principles. The mathematical formulations for the hybrid loss function, trace matching, step consistency, and guided beam search are technically sound and appropriate for the task. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes ablation studies to assess the impact of different components. The integration of two complementary cognitive architectures (ACT-R and CLARION) is well-justified based on their respective strengths. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) more detailed explanation of how the cognitive model activations will be mapped to LLM attention patterns, (2) clearer justification for the specific form of the cognitive alignment loss, and (3) more discussion of potential failure modes and mitigation strategies."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a challenging but potentially achievable research agenda. Several aspects support its feasibility: (1) the use of existing cognitive architectures (ACT-R, CLARION) rather than developing new ones, (2) the modular approach that allows for incremental implementation and testing, and (3) the clear experimental design with well-defined metrics. However, significant challenges affect its feasibility: (1) the complexity of integrating symbolic cognitive architectures with neural LLMs may be more difficult than anticipated, (2) obtaining and preprocessing appropriate cognitive trace data at scale could be resource-intensive, (3) the computational requirements for training with the hybrid loss function may be substantial, and (4) the proposal doesn't fully address how to handle the potential mismatch between the discrete, rule-based nature of cognitive architectures and the continuous, probabilistic nature of LLMs. These challenges don't make the proposal infeasible, but they do suggest that significant technical hurdles will need to be overcome, possibly requiring scope adjustments during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in AI alignment and interpretability. By grounding LLM reasoning in cognitive architectures, it has the potential to significantly improve the transparency, trustworthiness, and human-alignment of these models. The expected outcomes include both technical contributions (framework, datasets, models) and scientific insights about the integration of cognitive science with machine learning. The societal impact section convincingly argues for applications in education, healthcare, and human-AI collaboration. The proposal directly addresses the growing concern about the opacity of LLM reasoning processes, which is a critical issue for high-stakes applications. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's focus on open-source models and datasets, which could benefit the broader research community. While the proposal has high potential impact, it's not completely transformative of the field, as it builds upon existing work rather than introducing an entirely new paradigm, which is why it scores an 8 rather than higher."
