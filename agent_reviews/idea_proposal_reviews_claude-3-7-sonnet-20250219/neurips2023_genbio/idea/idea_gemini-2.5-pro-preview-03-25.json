        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Designing and optimizing novel and useful biomolecules' topic and the 'biological experiment design with GenerativeAI-in-the-loop' challenge mentioned in the special track. The proposal directly tackles the inefficiency of current biomolecule optimization approaches by integrating generative AI with Bayesian optimization in an active learning framework. It addresses the task's focus on rational design and optimization while incorporating the concept of AI-guided experimental design, which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (costly wet-lab experiments), the proposed solution (active learning with generative surrogates), and the expected benefits (reduced experiments and faster convergence). The workflow is well-defined: generative model creates a surrogate, Bayesian optimization selects candidates, wet-lab testing provides feedback, and the model is updated. However, some minor details could be further elaborated, such as specific metrics for 'maximal information gain' and how the posterior distribution updating mechanism works in practice. The technical approach is sound but could benefit from slightly more specificity about implementation details."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing techniques (generative models, Bayesian optimization, active learning) in a novel way specifically for biomolecule optimization. While each individual component (generative models for biomolecules, Bayesian optimization, experimental design) exists in the literature, their integration into a closed-loop system with wet-lab validation represents a fresh approach. The novelty lies in the specific application and integration rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithms. The approach of using generative models as differentiable surrogates within a Bayesian optimization framework for biomolecule design is relatively uncommon and represents a meaningful innovation, though not a completely revolutionary concept."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible with current technology and methods, though it faces some practical challenges. The technical components (generative models, Bayesian optimization) are well-established. However, implementation would require significant resources for wet-lab experiments, which the proposal acknowledges as costly and time-consuming. The iterative nature of the approach means results would take time to materialize. There are also potential challenges in creating accurate surrogate models for complex biomolecular functions and ensuring that uncertainty estimates are reliable enough to guide experimental design effectively. Despite these challenges, the approach is implementable with current technology and expertise, making it reasonably feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research idea is high as it addresses a critical bottleneck in biomolecule design: the inefficiency and high cost of experimental validation. If successful, this approach could dramatically accelerate the discovery and optimization of functional biomolecules with applications in medicine, biotechnology, and materials science. The potential impact extends beyond just computational efficiency to enabling discoveries that might otherwise be impractical due to experimental constraints. By intelligently guiding experimental resources, the approach could lead to faster development of therapeutics, enzymes, and other biomolecules with tailored functions. The alignment with the growing field of AI-guided scientific discovery further enhances its significance."
