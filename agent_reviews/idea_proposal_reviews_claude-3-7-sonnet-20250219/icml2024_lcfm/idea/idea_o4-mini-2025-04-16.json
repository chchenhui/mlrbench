        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on long-context foundation models. It directly addresses the challenge of processing extreme-length contexts (millions of tokens) which is a core topic of the workshop. The proposal incorporates multiple elements from the workshop topics: new modeling strategies (hierarchical compression), efficiency techniques (adaptive compute allocation), retrieval augmentation, and potential interdisciplinary applications (genomic analysis, code comprehension). The only minor gap is that while the workshop mentions various data forms (images, audio, etc.), the proposal focuses primarily on text-based contexts."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, proposed solution, and expected outcomes. The hierarchical approach is explained with specific components (retriever, Context Compressor, specialized attention layers). The training methodology and evaluation benchmarks are also specified. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the exact mechanism of the 'gated summarization' and how the 'specialized hierarchical cross-attention layers' would adaptively allocate compute. The relationship between the different granularity levels and how they interact in the final model architecture could also be more precisely defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents significant innovation in its hierarchical approach to extreme-length context processing. While retrieval-augmented models and context compression techniques exist separately, the multi-granularity compression combined with adaptive compute allocation represents a novel integration. The joint training of retriever, compressor, and transformer with a combined objective is also innovative. The approach isn't entirely unprecedented—hierarchical attention and multi-granularity representations have been explored—but the specific combination for extreme-length contexts and the end-to-end trainable pipeline represents a meaningful advancement over existing approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The individual components (retrieval, compression, attention mechanisms) are established techniques, making the overall approach technically viable. However, training such a complex end-to-end system with multiple interacting components would require substantial computational resources. The joint optimization of retriever, compressor, and transformer might face convergence issues. Additionally, processing millions of tokens, even with the proposed efficiency improvements, remains computationally intensive. The benchmarking on multi-document QA and genomic pattern discovery is feasible, though creating appropriate evaluation datasets for extreme-length contexts might require additional effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical limitation in current foundation models—their inability to effectively process extremely long contexts. Success would enable transformative applications in document analysis, scientific research, and software engineering. The potential for linear-to-sublinear scaling in compute cost represents a significant efficiency breakthrough. The approach could establish a new paradigm for handling long contexts that balances retrieval and compression, potentially influencing future model architectures. The impact extends across multiple domains (text, code, genomics) and could enable entirely new capabilities in foundation models. The significance is particularly high given the growing importance of processing and synthesizing information across vast datasets."
