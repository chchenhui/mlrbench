    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on efficiency techniques for long-context foundation models by tackling the KV cache memory bottleneck. The proposed ADKVC method is faithful to the original idea of using attention patterns to guide dynamic compression. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works (FastKV, DynamicKV, KV-Distill) and positioning itself relative to these approaches. It acknowledges the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly balancing compression and performance (Challenge 1) and developing adaptive compression strategies (Challenge 2). The methodology section provides a detailed technical approach that is consistent with the stated objectives and builds upon existing knowledge in the field."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction provides sufficient background and motivation, the methodology section offers detailed mathematical formulations of the proposed approach, and the expected outcomes are explicitly stated. The technical details of attention history tracking and dynamic compression policy are thoroughly explained with appropriate equations. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying models, baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of how the relevance scores will be efficiently updated during inference could be more specific, (2) the computational overhead of tracking and updating relevance scores could be more thoroughly addressed, and (3) the proposal could more clearly articulate how the dynamic compression policy will be initialized for the first few tokens when historical attention data is not yet available."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to KV cache compression by using historical attention patterns to guide dynamic compression decisions. While individual components (attention-based pruning, quantization, cache management) have been explored in prior work, the specific combination and implementation of tracking historical attention weights to inform compression decisions appears to be original. The proposal differentiates itself from existing methods like FastKV (which uses Token-Selective Propagation), DynamicKV (which is task-adaptive), and KV-Distill (which uses learnable compression). However, the core idea of using attention signals to guide compression has some conceptual overlap with attention-based token pruning (reference 10) and H2O methods mentioned in the proposal. The novelty is in the specific mechanism of tracking historical attention patterns over time rather than just recent attention spikes, and in the dynamic mapping of these patterns to variable compression rates, but it builds incrementally on existing concepts rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness. The mathematical formulation of the attention mechanism and the proposed modifications are correct and well-justified. The approach is grounded in the established understanding of Transformer attention mechanisms and builds logically on this foundation. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. The proposal acknowledges potential limitations and includes ablation studies to isolate the effects of different components. The hypothesis that tokens receiving high attention are more important for future predictions is reasonable and supported by existing literature on attention mechanisms. However, there are a few aspects that could be strengthened: (1) the proposal could provide more theoretical analysis of why historical attention patterns would be predictive of future importance, (2) the computational complexity analysis could be more rigorous, and (3) the proposal could more thoroughly address potential edge cases where the approach might fail (e.g., when attention patterns shift dramatically during generation)."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed research is generally feasible within the scope of current technology and methods. The implementation builds on existing Transformer frameworks and requires modifications to the inference loop rather than fundamental architectural changes. The models and datasets specified are publicly available, and the evaluation metrics are standard in the field. The proposal includes a detailed algorithm for implementation. However, there are several practical challenges that affect feasibility: (1) the computational overhead of tracking and updating relevance scores for each token at each layer could be significant, potentially offsetting some of the efficiency gains from compression; (2) the memory required to store relevance scores adds overhead, though the proposal acknowledges this is small compared to the KV cache itself; (3) the dynamic re-quantization of KV pairs based on updated relevance scores could introduce additional latency during inference; and (4) implementing and comparing against state-of-the-art baselines like FastKV and DynamicKV might be challenging if detailed implementations are not available. Overall, while the approach is implementable, these practical considerations may impact the real-world efficiency gains."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying long-context foundation models: the memory requirements of the KV cache during inference. This is a significant problem with broad implications for the accessibility and applicability of these models. If successful, the research could enable longer effective context lengths on existing hardware, democratize access to powerful LCFMs by reducing hardware requirements, and provide insights into attention dynamics in these models. These outcomes align perfectly with the workshop's focus on efficiency techniques for long-context models. The approach is also potentially model-agnostic, making it widely applicable across different Transformer-based architectures. The significance is somewhat tempered by the incremental nature of the advance (building on existing compression techniques rather than proposing a fundamentally new architecture) and the fact that it addresses only one aspect of the efficiency challenge (KV cache memory, not computation or training efficiency). Nevertheless, given the practical importance of the problem and the potential for real-world impact, the significance is high."
