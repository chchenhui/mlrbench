        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on challenging assumptions in human feedback models for AI alignment, particularly the assumption of human rationality. The proposal expands on the core idea of modeling cognitive effort in human feedback by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework, computational methods, and experimental validation approach. It incorporates concepts from bounded rationality as mentioned in the literature review and addresses the key challenges identified, such as modeling cognitive effort, integrating bounded rationality frameworks, and identifying systematic biases. The proposal also connects well with the workshop's interdisciplinary focus by bridging cognitive science, behavioral economics, and machine learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-explained, particularly the extension of standard preference models to incorporate cognitive effort. The three-part methodology (theoretical model, computational framework, and experimental validation) is clearly delineated with specific details for implementation. The experimental design is thoroughly described with appropriate sample sizes, conditions, and measurements. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity, such as more explicit connections between the heuristic function H(d_i|c) and specific cognitive shortcuts, and more details on how the physiological measures would be integrated into the effort estimation process."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly original approach to human-AI alignment by explicitly modeling cognitive effort as a mediating variable between true preferences and expressed feedback. While inverse reinforcement learning and preference learning are established fields, the integration of cognitive effort dynamics represents a significant innovation. The hierarchical Bayesian framework for jointly inferring preferences and effort levels is a novel methodological contribution. The proposal also introduces innovative experimental protocols for validating effort-aware preference models. The mathematical formulation P(d_i|θ, e, c) ∝ exp(β · (e · U(d_i|θ) + (1-e) · H(d_i|c))) that explicitly models the transition from preference-based to heuristic-based decision making is particularly innovative and addresses a fundamental gap in current alignment approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations, drawing appropriately from bounded rationality theory, Bayesian inference, and inverse reinforcement learning. The mathematical framework is well-formulated and builds logically on established preference learning models. The experimental methodology is rigorous, with appropriate controls, sample sizes, and multiple measurement approaches. The variational inference approach for implementation is technically sound and appropriate for the problem. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) the relationship between the proposed effort function e = f(c, κ) = κ/(c + κ) and empirical findings in cognitive science could be more thoroughly justified; (2) the proposal could more explicitly address potential confounds in the experimental design, such as learning effects across repeated preference elicitations; and (3) more details on the validation of the heuristic function H(d_i|c) would strengthen the technical soundness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The experimental design with 200 participants is ambitious but achievable with proper recruitment strategies. The computational methods (MCMC sampling, variational inference) are well-established and implementable with current technology. However, there are several feasibility challenges: (1) accurately measuring cognitive effort, especially through physiological measures, may require specialized equipment and expertise; (2) establishing 'ground truth' preferences in Experiment 2 is inherently difficult and may introduce methodological complications; (3) the joint inference of preferences and effort levels may face computational challenges with high-dimensional preference spaces; and (4) recruiting participants for the extended protocol in Experiment 2 may face attrition issues. While these challenges are significant, they do not render the proposal infeasible, but rather require careful planning and potential methodological adjustments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in human-AI alignment that has substantial implications across multiple domains. By developing methods to distinguish between true preferences and artifacts of cognitive limitations, the research could significantly improve the robustness and safety of AI systems that learn from human feedback. The potential applications span healthcare decision support, educational technology, recommendation systems, and large language model alignment—all areas where misinterpreting human feedback due to cognitive constraints could lead to harmful outcomes. The theoretical contributions would advance our understanding of human decision-making under cognitive constraints, while the methodological advances would provide practical tools for more accurate preference inference. The interdisciplinary nature of the work bridges important gaps between cognitive science and AI alignment, potentially catalyzing new research directions. The focus on addressing a fundamental limitation in current alignment approaches makes this work particularly significant for the development of AI systems that genuinely understand and align with human intentions."
