    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on challenging simplistic human feedback models in AI alignment by explicitly modeling cognitive effort in human decision-making. The methodology incorporates bounded rationality frameworks from cognitive science as mentioned in both the task description and research idea. The proposal builds upon the cited literature, particularly extending inverse reinforcement learning approaches (from Ren et al. and Jarrett et al.) to account for cognitive effort. The four-component methodology (model formalization, hierarchical inference, data collection, and experimental validation) comprehensively addresses the research objectives stated in the introduction. The only minor inconsistency is that while the workshop title mentions 'Mechanistic Interpretability,' the proposal focuses more on modeling human feedback rather than interpreting AI mechanisms, though this is still within the workshop's stated topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and conclusion. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is presented with precise mathematical formulations. The utility model with effort cost, stochastic choice model, hierarchical priors, and posterior inference objective are all rigorously defined. The experimental design, including data collection protocols and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly explained. The only areas that could benefit from additional clarity are: (1) some technical details about the variational inference implementation could be more explicit about how the factorization handles the non-linear components of the model, and (2) the connection between the effort parameter e and observable human behaviors could be more concretely specified to strengthen the empirical grounding of the model."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers significant novelty in explicitly modeling cognitive effort within the context of human feedback for AI alignment. While inverse reinforcement learning and preference learning are established fields, the integration of cognitive effort as a formal component in the utility function represents a fresh perspective. The hierarchical Bayesian approach to jointly infer both preference parameters and effort levels is innovative. The proposal extends beyond existing work (like Jarrett et al.'s Inverse Decision Modeling) by specifically parameterizing effort costs rather than just modeling general biases. The experimental design involving controlled task complexities and time constraints to measure effort effects is also novel. However, some components build incrementally on existing methods (e.g., the variational inference approach and softmax choice models are standard techniques), which prevents it from receiving the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical formulations. The utility model incorporating both reward and effort cost is grounded in established economic and cognitive science principles. The hierarchical Bayesian framework is appropriate for capturing individual differences while learning population-level parameters. The mathematical formulations for the likelihood model, priors, and inference objectives are technically correct and well-specified. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, including both synthetic validation (where ground truth is known) and human behavioral studies. The comparison against multiple baselines and inclusion of ablation studies shows rigorous experimental design. The statistical analysis plan is appropriate for the research questions. The only minor limitation is that the effort cost function C(a|s) is somewhat simplified (proportional to number of pairwise evaluations), which may not capture all aspects of cognitive effort, though this is acknowledged implicitly in the future directions."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, though with moderate implementation challenges. The technical components (variational inference, hierarchical Bayesian modeling) are well-established methods with available software libraries (PyTorch, Pyro). The data collection protocol is realistic, with a reasonable sample size (N≈100) and well-defined tasks. The synthetic data generation provides a controlled environment to validate the inference algorithm before moving to human data. However, several aspects introduce complexity: (1) the hierarchical Bayesian inference with non-linear utility functions may face convergence challenges at scale; (2) recruiting and maintaining consistent human participation across multiple task conditions requires significant coordination; (3) accurately measuring cognitive effort in online settings has inherent noise; and (4) the implementation of both VI and MCMC methods for comparison adds to the workload. While these challenges are manageable, they require careful execution and may necessitate methodological adjustments during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in human-AI alignment with potentially far-reaching implications. By explicitly modeling cognitive effort in human feedback, it tackles a fundamental limitation in current approaches like RLHF that assume rational, consistent human behavior. The expected outcomes—reducing preference inference error by 15-30% and identifying systematic biases from effort constraints—would significantly advance the field's understanding of human feedback. The impact extends to multiple high-stakes domains including healthcare decision support, educational systems, and ethical AI alignment broadly. The work bridges cognitive science and machine learning in a novel way that could influence future research directions in both fields. The proposal also has practical significance for improving feedback interfaces and RLHF protocols. The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect score is that while the theoretical and methodological contributions are clear, the translation to deployed systems would require additional steps not fully elaborated in the proposal."
