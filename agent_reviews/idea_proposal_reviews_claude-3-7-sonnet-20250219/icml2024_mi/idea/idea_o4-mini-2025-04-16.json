        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding human feedback models in AI alignment, particularly challenging the simplistic assumptions in RLHF about human rationality and unbiased feedback. The proposal specifically tackles bounded rationality, effort costs, and systematic biases in human feedback - all explicitly mentioned as relevant topics in the workshop description. The hierarchical Bayesian approach to model these human factors fits perfectly with the workshop's goal of developing better mathematical and computational models of human feedback. The application to language tasks is also relevant to the LLM fine-tuning mentioned in the topics list."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (unrealistic assumptions about human feedback in RLHF), the proposed solution (hierarchical Bayesian RLHF with bounded-rationality modeling), and the implementation approach (collecting calibration data, integrating parameters as latent variables, and using Gaussian process regularization). The expected outcomes are also well-defined. The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details - for example, the exact formulation of the bounded-rationality model and how the 'effort scores' would be quantified and collected. These details would need further elaboration in a full proposal, but the core idea is well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty by integrating bounded rationality models from behavioral economics into RLHF frameworks - a combination that appears to be underexplored. While both RLHF and bounded rationality models exist separately, their integration in a hierarchical Bayesian framework with explicit modeling of individual annotator parameters represents a fresh approach. The addition of 'effort scores' and calibration tasks to estimate individual noise parameters and bias priors is particularly innovative. The approach doesn't completely reinvent either field but creates a valuable new intersection between them that addresses a recognized gap in current RLHF implementations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The core components - RLHF pipelines, Bayesian modeling, and bounded rationality frameworks - all exist and have established methodologies. However, integrating these components requires careful design of the hierarchical model and appropriate calibration tasks. Collecting reliable 'effort scores' and accurately estimating individual bias parameters may be challenging and require significant experimental design work. The Gaussian process regularization approach is technically sound but may require computational optimization for large-scale language tasks. Overall, the idea is implementable with current technology and methods, though it would require substantial expertise in both machine learning and behavioral modeling."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI alignment that has been explicitly acknowledged but inadequately addressed in current systems. Improving the quality of reward models by accounting for human cognitive limitations could significantly enhance the safety, reliability, and alignment of AI systems trained with human feedback. The potential impact extends beyond the specific application to language models, potentially influencing the broader field of human-AI alignment. By providing a more realistic model of human feedback, this work could help bridge the gap between theoretical alignment goals and practical implementation. The workshop explicitly calls for better understanding of human feedback models, and this research directly contributes to that goal with a concrete, implementable framework."
