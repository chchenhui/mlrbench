    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on mechanistic interpretability and human-AI alignment. It directly addresses the workshop's concern about questionable assumptions in human feedback models by focusing on bounded rationality in human decision-making. The proposal specifically targets the workshop's critique that current approaches like RLHF assume humans act rationally and provide unbiased feedback. The research methodology incorporates elements from cognitive science and behavioral economics, which are explicitly mentioned as relevant topics in the workshop description. The proposal's goal to develop mechanistic models of human decision-making that account for cognitive biases is perfectly aligned with the workshop's aim to better understand human feedback for improved AI alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity and structure. It clearly outlines the motivation, main idea, methodology (with four well-defined steps), and expected outcomes. The proposal articulates a specific focus on bounded rationality and identifies particular cognitive biases (anchoring, framing, loss aversion) that will be studied. The methodology is logically sequenced from data collection to application. However, some minor ambiguities remain: the specific experimental designs for data collection aren't detailed, the exact mechanistic modeling techniques aren't specified, and the evaluation metrics for comparing model predictions with human behavior could be more precisely defined. These details would further enhance the clarity of an otherwise well-articulated proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to human-AI alignment. While bounded rationality and cognitive biases are established concepts in behavioral economics and cognitive science, applying mechanistic interpretability techniques to model these phenomena for AI alignment represents a fresh combination of existing fields. The proposal innovatively bridges cognitive science, behavioral economics, and AI alignment in a way that addresses a significant gap in current approaches. However, it doesn't introduce fundamentally new concepts or methodologies; rather, it applies existing frameworks in a novel context. The idea of incorporating cognitive biases into AI systems has been explored before, though perhaps not with the specific mechanistic approach proposed here. The novelty lies more in the integration and application than in creating entirely new concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Data collection on human decision-making with cognitive biases is well-established in behavioral economics, providing a solid foundation. However, developing mechanistic models that accurately capture the complexity of human cognitive biases is significantly challenging. The proposal doesn't specify how it will address the inherent variability in human decision-making across different individuals and contexts. The evaluation phase may also face difficulties in establishing ground truth for comparison, as human behavior is often inconsistent. The application phase, which involves integrating these models into AI systems, represents another layer of complexity that may require substantial resources and expertise across multiple disciplines. While the individual components are feasible, their integration presents considerable challenges that may require more detailed planning and potentially more resources than implied."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical gap in current AI alignment approaches and has significant potential impact. Improving our understanding of bounded rationality in human decision-making directly tackles one of the fundamental challenges identified in the workshop description: the oversimplified assumptions about human feedback in current AI systems. If successful, this research could substantially improve AI alignment by creating systems that better understand and accommodate human cognitive limitations and biases. This has broad implications for numerous applications mentioned in the workshop, including robotics, recommender systems, autonomous driving, and large language models. The potential to make AI systems more ethical and user-centric by accounting for human cognitive biases represents a meaningful contribution to the field. The significance is heightened by the growing deployment of AI systems that interact with humans, making alignment increasingly important."
