        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on robots with human-level abilities. It directly addresses the workshop's interest in novel ML algorithms integrating large multi-modal models for robot control, which is explicitly mentioned as an area of interest. The proposal focuses on long-horizon tasks like 'tidy the room' which matches the workshop's example of 'tidying up a house'. The adaptive skill composition approach also addresses the workshop's concern about robustness in unstructured environments. The only minor gap is that while the workshop mentions interest in sim-to-real bridging, this aspect isn't explicitly addressed in the proposal, though it may be implied in the implementation."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, proposed approach, and expected outcomes. The motivation establishes the limitations of current methods and the potential of LMMs. The main idea explains how the LMM will be integrated with robot skills to generate conditional sequence plans that adapt based on real-world feedback. The approach to fine-tuning using RL or imitation learning is specified. However, some technical details could be more precise - for example, how exactly the probabilistic policy over skill transitions will be represented and implemented, what specific architecture will connect the LMM to the skill library, and what evaluation metrics will be used to measure success. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines several existing concepts (LMMs, skill libraries, adaptive planning) in a novel way. The key innovation appears to be the use of LMMs to generate probabilistic policies over skill transitions rather than fixed sequences, allowing for mid-execution adaptation. This approach differs from most current LMM-based robotics systems that typically generate static plans. However, the core components (LMMs for planning, skill libraries, conditional execution) have been explored separately in recent literature. The novelty lies in their integration and the specific focus on adaptive skill composition for long-horizon tasks, rather than in introducing fundamentally new technical concepts. The approach represents an incremental but meaningful advance over existing methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, it builds on existing technologies (pre-trained LMMs and learned robot skills) rather than requiring entirely new capabilities. However, several significant challenges exist: 1) Training an LMM to output reliable probabilistic policies over skill transitions would require substantial data and compute resources; 2) Ensuring robust closed-loop execution based on visual feedback in unstructured environments remains difficult; 3) The fine-tuning process using RL or imitation learning would need careful design to avoid catastrophic forgetting of the LMM's capabilities; 4) Real-world deployment would require addressing safety concerns when adapting plans mid-execution. These challenges don't make the idea impractical, but they do suggest considerable engineering and research effort would be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research addresses a critical challenge in robotics: enabling robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. If successful, this approach could significantly advance the field's ability to deploy robots in household settings for practical assistance tasks. The adaptive nature of the proposed system directly addresses a major limitation of current methods - their brittleness when faced with environmental variations. The integration of LMMs with robotics skills could establish a valuable paradigm for leveraging foundation models in embodied AI. The impact would extend beyond the specific implementation to influence how researchers approach the composition of complex behaviors in robotics systems. The significance is high because it tackles a fundamental bottleneck in deploying robots in real-world settings."
