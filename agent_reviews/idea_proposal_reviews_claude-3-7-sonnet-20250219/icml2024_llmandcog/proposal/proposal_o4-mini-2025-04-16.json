    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on assessing LLMs' cognitive abilities, particularly in planning, navigation, and theory of mind. The Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB) methodology is consistent with the original idea of creating an adaptive evaluation framework that can pinpoint emergence thresholds. The proposal thoroughly incorporates the literature review by addressing the limitations of static benchmarks identified in the cited papers and building upon concepts like the modular architecture from Hypothetical Minds, the cognitive dynamics from CogGPT, and the ToM capabilities discussed in Li et al. The only minor inconsistency is that the proposal could have more explicitly connected to the workshop's interest in comparing LLMs to human cognition."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined, and the technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The curriculum sampling mechanism using multi-armed bandits is particularly well-explained, as is the emergence point estimation. The methodology section provides concrete details on task generation, difficulty parameterization, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for generating diverse tasks within each domain could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the human-in-the-loop audit and the automatic scoring system could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'coherence collapse') are used without full explanation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly innovative approach to LLM evaluation through its dynamic, adaptive benchmarking system. The DCB's use of multi-armed bandits to automatically adjust task difficulty based on model performance is a novel contribution that addresses a significant gap in current evaluation methods. The integration of emergence point estimation to quantify when cognitive abilities 'turn on' is particularly original. The proposal also innovatively combines techniques from reinforcement learning with LLM evaluation and incorporates human auditing in a systematic way. While the individual components (task generation, bandit algorithms, human-in-the-loop verification) exist in various contexts, their integration into a cohesive framework for cognitive evaluation of LLMs represents a fresh approach. The novelty is somewhat tempered by building on existing work in adaptive testing and multi-armed bandits, but the application to LLM cognitive abilities is distinctive."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent technical rigor and soundness. The mathematical formulations for the multi-armed bandit algorithm, Q-value updates, and emergence point estimation are precise and well-justified. The experimental design includes appropriate controls (static benchmarks) and covers a comprehensive range of model types. The evaluation metrics are well-chosen to capture both performance trajectories and emergence thresholds. The proposal shows awareness of potential methodological pitfalls, such as auto-scoring reliability, and incorporates mechanisms to address them through human auditing. The logistic performance curve fitting provides a principled way to compare models across different cognitive domains. The methodology is grounded in established techniques from reinforcement learning and psychometrics, and the authors have clearly thought through the technical challenges of implementing such a system. The only minor limitation is that the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential confounding factors in measuring emergence points."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, though with some implementation challenges. The core components—task generation, bandit-based sampling, and evaluation metrics—are all implementable with current technology. The experimental design with 2,000 tasks per model is reasonable in scope. However, several practical challenges may affect feasibility: (1) Creating diverse, parameterizable tasks across three domains will require substantial engineering effort; (2) Human-in-the-loop auditing of 5% of tasks (100 per model) demands significant resources and coordination; (3) Ensuring consistent scoring across the wide range of possible LLM responses will be challenging; (4) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle potential instability in the bandit algorithm when model performance is highly variable. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they do increase its complexity and resource requirements. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed discussion of implementation strategies and potential fallback approaches."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current LLM evaluation methods and has the potential for substantial impact across multiple dimensions. By developing a dynamic benchmark that can precisely locate emergence thresholds for cognitive abilities, the research would provide unprecedented insights into how and when LLMs acquire higher-order reasoning capabilities. This directly addresses core questions in the workshop about the fundamental limits of language models and their performance on cognitive tasks. The expected outcomes—including fine-grained cognitive profiles, comparisons between architecture types, and a public benchmark suite—would be valuable resources for the research community. The work bridges AI, cognitive science, and neuroscience, potentially catalyzing interdisciplinary research on the nature of emergent intelligence. The proposal's focus on planning and theory-of-mind is particularly significant given their centrality to human cognition and the current limitations of LLMs in these areas. The DCB methodology could also establish a new paradigm for adaptive evaluation that extends beyond the specific cognitive domains studied."
