    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on LLMs and cognition, specifically addressing Theory of Mind (ToM) which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest. The proposal directly tackles the question of 'Where do LLMs stand in terms of performance on cognitive tasks, such as theory of mind?' and explores whether 'multimodal approaches [can] address some of current limits of LLMs to cognitive tasks.' The idea also touches on the comparison between language-only models and those augmented with additional modalities, which relates to the workshop's interest in comparing different LLM architectures. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address the neuroscience or interpretability aspects mentioned in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a three-stage approach with clear objectives. The motivation is well-articulated, identifying the specific gap in current LLMs' capabilities regarding Theory of Mind. The proposed methodology involving pre-training on visual scenarios, implementing a specialized attention mechanism, and evaluation on ToM tasks is logically structured. However, some technical details could be further elaborated - for instance, the exact nature of the 'novel attention mechanism' that tracks perceptual access is not fully specified, and the evaluation metrics for measuring success in ToM tasks could be more precisely defined. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving the highest clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to enhancing LLMs' Theory of Mind capabilities through multimodal training. While multimodal LLMs exist, the specific focus on using visual grounding to develop ToM capabilities and the proposed attention mechanism that explicitly tracks perceptual access across agents represent innovative elements. The three-stage framework offers a fresh perspective on addressing ToM limitations. However, the core concept of using multimodal inputs to improve language model capabilities builds upon existing research directions rather than introducing a completely revolutionary approach. The novelty lies more in the specific application and implementation details rather than in creating an entirely new paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate feasibility challenges. Creating a curated dataset of videos depicting false-belief scenarios with annotated mental states would require significant effort and expertise in both cognitive psychology and data annotation. Implementing an attention mechanism that accurately tracks perceptual access across agents is technically complex and may require substantial engineering work. The evaluation on increasingly complex ToM tasks is feasible but would need careful design to ensure it truly measures ToM rather than pattern matching. Current multimodal architectures provide a foundation to build upon, but the specialized nature of ToM reasoning and the need to track beliefs versus reality adds complexity. While challenging, these obstacles are not insurmountable with sufficient resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental limitation in current AI systems - the ability to understand and reason about others' mental states. Enhancing Theory of Mind capabilities in LLMs would represent a significant advancement toward more socially intelligent AI systems that can better understand human intentions, beliefs, and desires. Success in this area could lead to improvements in human-AI interaction, social robotics, educational assistants, and therapeutic applications. The research also has interdisciplinary significance, potentially providing insights into human cognitive development and social cognition. While focused on a specific cognitive capability rather than a broader transformation of AI, the importance of ToM for human-like intelligence and the potential applications make this a highly significant research direction."
