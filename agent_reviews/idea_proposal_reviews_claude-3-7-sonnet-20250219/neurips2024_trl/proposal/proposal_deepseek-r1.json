    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on generative models for structured data, particularly in the context of LLM-driven systems for tabular data. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the original idea, including the multi-agent framework, constraint-aware validation, and privacy mechanisms. It thoroughly builds upon the literature review, citing relevant works like HARMONIC (Wang et al., 2024), TabuLa (Zhao et al., 2023), and addressing the key challenges identified in the review such as schema compliance, privacy preservation, and capturing complex dependencies. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposal addresses these challenges through its four-stage approach."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The four-stage approach (Retrieval-Augmented LLM Generation, Schema Validation, Quality Assessment, and Differential Privacy) is logically presented with specific details on implementation. The technical aspects are explained with appropriate mathematical formulations, such as the Jensen-Shannon Divergence for statistical similarity evaluation. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as more details on how the Quality Assessor's feedback specifically modifies the LLM's generation process, and more concrete examples of the business rules that would be enforced by the Schema Validator."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several approaches in a novel way. The multi-agent framework combining LLMs with specialized validation agents represents a fresh perspective on synthetic data generation. The integration of schema validation with differential privacy and quality assessment in an iterative feedback loop is innovative. However, many of the individual components build upon existing techniques mentioned in the literature review, such as retrieval-augmented generation (Adams & Brown, 2024), differential privacy mechanisms (Doe & Smith, 2023), and schema constraints (Johnson & Williams, 2023). While the combination is novel, the proposal could push boundaries further by introducing more groundbreaking techniques in at least one of its components rather than primarily integrating existing approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The four-stage approach is well-justified and based on established methods from the literature. The mathematical formulations for constraint validation, statistical similarity measurement, and differential privacy are correctly presented. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and validation techniques (5-fold cross-validation, paired t-tests). The proposal acknowledges the trade-offs between privacy and utility, addressing them through the Quality Assessor agent. However, there are some areas that could benefit from deeper theoretical justification, such as the choice of nucleus sampling with p=0.95 for decoding, and more detailed explanation of how the differential privacy mechanisms would be calibrated to achieve the target ε ≤ 1.0 while maintaining acceptable utility."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. It leverages available LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3), established differential privacy techniques, and well-defined evaluation metrics. The experimental design using public datasets is practical and implementable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require considerable effort. The fine-tuning of LLMs on tabular data using the permutation-based strategy may be computationally expensive. The Schema Validator agent needs to handle complex business rules that might vary significantly across domains, requiring substantial domain knowledge encoding. The iterative refinement process between the Quality Assessor and the LLM generation could be time-consuming to optimize. Additionally, achieving the stated privacy goal (ε ≤ 1.0) with minimal utility degradation (<5%) is ambitious and may require significant tuning."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses important challenges in synthetic tabular data generation that have significant real-world implications. The ability to generate high-fidelity, constraint-compliant synthetic data would benefit numerous applications facing data scarcity or privacy restrictions, such as healthcare analytics, financial modeling, and enterprise data sharing. The expected outcomes of reducing constraint violations by ≥30% and improving statistical fidelity by ≥15% would represent meaningful advances in the field. The proposal's focus on both privacy preservation and data utility addresses a critical gap in existing approaches. The potential impact on data sharing under privacy regulations like GDPR is particularly significant. However, the proposal could more explicitly address how SynthTab would handle very large datasets or extremely complex schemas with hundreds of interrelated tables, which would further enhance its significance for enterprise-scale applications."
