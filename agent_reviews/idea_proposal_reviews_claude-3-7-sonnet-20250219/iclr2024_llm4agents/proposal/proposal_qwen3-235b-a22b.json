    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Memory Mechanisms and Linguistic Representation' topic from the workshop by developing a biologically-inspired semantic memory architecture with forgetting capabilities. The dual-pathway approach (semantic network + forgetting mechanism) perfectly matches the initial research idea. The proposal extensively references the literature review, citing works like MemoryBank (Zhong et al., 2023), UGBench (Wang et al., 2025), and RecallM (Kynoch et al., 2023) both as baselines and foundations. It addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, including catastrophic forgetting, balancing retention with forgetting, and efficient memory management. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions GDPR compliance and ethical unlearning, it could have more explicitly connected to the 'Reasoning, Planning, and Risks' topic from the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the semantic network design and forgetting mechanism, including mathematical formulations that enhance precision. The system overview clearly delineates the two core components (semantic network and dynamic forgetting mechanism). The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the RL optimization and the forgetting parameters could be more explicitly defined; (2) Some technical terms (e.g., 'hierarchical agglomerative clustering') are introduced without sufficient explanation for non-specialists; and (3) The transition between the semantic network and the forgetting mechanism could be more seamlessly integrated to show how they interact in practice."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The integration of a hierarchical semantic network with a dynamic forgetting mechanism guided by reinforcement learning represents a fresh approach to memory management in LLMs. The use of a forget score computation that balances recency, relevance, and importance is innovative, especially with the RL-optimized thresholding. The proposal also introduces novel evaluation protocols for unlearning and long-term coherence. However, several core components build upon existing work: the semantic network structure resembles knowledge graphs used in previous research, the forgetting curve mechanism draws heavily from MemoryBank (Zhong et al., 2023), and the use of RL for parameter optimization is an established technique. While the proposal creates a novel synthesis of these elements, it doesn't introduce fundamentally new algorithmic approaches or theoretical frameworks that would merit a higher novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The mathematical formulations for the semantic network, temporal compression, and forget score computation are rigorous and theoretically justified. The RL framework for optimizing forgetting parameters is well-specified with clear state space, action space, and reward function definitions. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and comprehensive evaluation metrics. The proposal also acknowledges potential risks and offers mitigation strategies. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) The temporal compression model uses an exponential decay parameter Î», but there's limited justification for how this parameter would be initially set or adapted; (2) The clustering approach for the semantic network could benefit from more detailed analysis of computational complexity and scalability; and (3) While the proposal mentions biological inspiration, it could more thoroughly connect the algorithmic components to specific neurobiological mechanisms of human memory to strengthen its theoretical foundations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible research plan with realistic components. The semantic network and forgetting mechanism are implementable using existing technologies and methods. The experimental design includes concrete datasets and evaluation metrics that can be reasonably executed. The use of established baselines like MemoryBank and RecallM provides practical comparison points. However, several aspects present implementation challenges: (1) The RL optimization of forgetting parameters may require significant computational resources and careful hyperparameter tuning; (2) The hierarchical semantic network could face scalability issues with very large knowledge bases; (3) The integration of the forgetting mechanism with existing LLM architectures might require non-trivial engineering work; and (4) The proposal aims for a 50% reduction in context usage without performance degradation, which is an ambitious goal that may require refinement based on initial results. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do suggest that considerable effort and resources would be needed for successful implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in LLM agent development: efficient memory management for long-term tasks. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions. From a technical perspective, the architecture could significantly improve LLM performance in extended interactions by reducing context saturation while maintaining coherence. The expected 15-20% improvement in coherence scores and 50% reduction in context usage would represent meaningful advances. The proposal also has broader implications for applications requiring GDPR compliance and ethical data handling. The connection to human cognitive processes adds scientific significance by bridging AI and cognitive science. However, while the proposal has clear significance for LLM agent development, its impact may be somewhat constrained to this specific domain rather than transforming the broader field of AI. Additionally, the practical implementation of the system in real-world applications may face challenges related to computational efficiency and integration with existing systems that could limit its immediate impact."
