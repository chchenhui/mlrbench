        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on exploring XAI applications across diverse domains (healthcare, legal reasoning, NLP, fairness auditing) and specifically targets the workshop's goal of exploring 'whether insights gained from one use case can be transferred to other use cases.' The proposed meta-explainability framework is designed to identify transferable patterns across domains, which perfectly matches the workshop's interest in cross-domain applications. The idea also addresses the obstacles hindering progress (fragmentation, 'explanation silos') and proposes methodological requirements for applying XAI in new domains, which are key topics in the task description."

        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-step approach (knowledge graph construction, cross-domain explanation generator, validation) provides a concrete implementation path. The examples given (e.g., transferring bias explanations from NLP to hiring algorithms) help illustrate the concept. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as how the 'causal reasoning and contrastive learning' would specifically work to adapt explanations across domains, and what metrics would be used in the proposed benchmarks for measuring transferability. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea presents a highly innovative approach to XAI by reconceptualizing explainability as a transferable property across domains. While domain-specific XAI methods exist in abundance, the meta-framework approach that systematically maps and transfers explanation patterns between fields represents a significant departure from current practices. The knowledge graph of explanations annotated with contextual constraints is particularly original. Most current XAI research focuses on developing or improving methods within domains rather than creating cross-domain frameworks. This meta-level approach to XAI represents a paradigm shift from developing isolated explanation techniques to creating a unified theory of explainability that transcends domain boundaries."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces several implementation challenges. Creating a comprehensive knowledge graph mapping explanations across diverse domains would require extensive expert knowledge in multiple fields and significant annotation efforts. The cross-domain explanation generator using causal reasoning would need to overcome the fundamental differences in what constitutes a good explanation in different contexts (e.g., legal vs. medical). While the individual components (knowledge graphs, contrastive learning) are established technologies, their integration for cross-domain explanation transfer remains unproven. The validation across multiple domains would require substantial resources and domain expertise. These challenges don't make the idea impractical, but they do suggest a high-complexity, resource-intensive project with significant technical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in current XAI research and practice. If successful, it could fundamentally transform how explainability methods are developed and deployed across domains. The potential impact is substantial: reducing redundant development efforts, enabling rapid adoption of XAI in emerging fields, establishing common principles of effective explanations, and fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration. The meta-framework could serve as a foundation for standardizing explainability approaches while maintaining domain-specific nuances. In a landscape where AI is being deployed across increasingly diverse applications, the ability to transfer explainability insights could accelerate responsible AI adoption and address shared challenges like transparency, fairness, and trust across multiple sectors."
