    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The MetaXplain idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on exploring XAI applications across diverse domains. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of identifying ways to transfer insights between use cases, which is a central theme. The proposal specifically mentions applications in healthcare, finance, and NLP, which are domains highlighted in the workshop description. The meta-learning approach also addresses the workshop's interest in overcoming obstacles in XAI adoption and exploring methodological requirements. The only minor gap is that while the workshop emphasizes understanding XAI limitations, the proposal doesn't explicitly discuss potential limitations of the meta-learning approach itself."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The MetaXplain idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation, main idea, methodology, and expected outcomes are all well-articulated and logically structured. The MAML-style meta-training approach is specified, along with clear evaluation criteria. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further elaboration: the specific types of explanation methods being meta-learned (e.g., attention-based, gradient-based, perturbation-based), the architecture of the base explainer model, and how the expert annotations would be collected and standardized across different domains. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The MetaXplain idea demonstrates exceptional novelty by applying meta-learning to the field of explainable AI. While meta-learning is established in other areas of machine learning, its application to create transferable explanation modules represents a genuinely innovative approach. The concept of learning 'explanation patterns' that transfer across domains is particularly original. Most current XAI research focuses on developing domain-specific methods or improving existing techniques within domains, whereas this proposal aims to fundamentally change how XAI methods are developed and deployed across different fields. This represents a significant paradigm shift in XAI research."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of MetaXplain faces several challenges. While meta-learning frameworks like MAML are established, applying them to explanations presents unique difficulties. Explanations across different domains (images, text, tabular data) have fundamentally different structures and semantics, making a universal explainer challenging to implement. The proposal requires paired datasets with expert annotations across multiple domains, which would be resource-intensive to collect. Additionally, standardizing explanation quality metrics across diverse domains is non-trivial. The methodology is conceptually sound but would require significant engineering effort and may face unexpected technical hurdles. The 5× faster adaptation claim also needs more substantiation given these challenges."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The significance of MetaXplain is substantial. If successful, it would address a major pain point in XAI adoption: the high cost and expertise required to deploy explanation methods in new domains. By enabling rapid adaptation to new fields with minimal data, it could dramatically accelerate XAI adoption across industries. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of extending XAI to new domains. The potential to establish consistent transparency standards across industries is particularly valuable for regulatory compliance and building user trust. While extremely valuable, it stops short of a perfect score because it builds upon rather than fundamentally reimagines the nature of explanations themselves."
