    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on XAI applications across different domains and the transferability of insights between use cases. The proposal builds upon the meta-learning approaches mentioned in the literature review (particularly FIND, MetaQuantus, and gradient-based meta-learning for interpretable AI) while extending them to create transferable explanation modules. The methodology section clearly outlines how the framework will work across multiple domains (healthcare, finance, legal text, climate science) with plans to evaluate on unseen domains, which aligns with the workshop's goal of exploring XAI in diverse fields. The proposal also addresses several challenges identified in the literature review, particularly domain-specific tailoring, data scarcity, and transferability of explanation modules."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The introduction effectively establishes the problem and motivation. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the MetaXplain framework, including the model architecture, meta-training approach, and evaluation metrics. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-presented. The expected outcomes are specific and measurable. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for handling different data modalities in the domain encoder could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the adaptation layer and the meta-explanation module could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical details about how the MAML optimization would be implemented for explanation transfer could be more explicit."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in applying meta-learning specifically to the problem of transferring explanation capabilities across domains. While meta-learning itself is not new, and some papers in the literature review have explored related concepts (like FIND for explainable meta-learning), the specific application to create a universal explainer that can rapidly adapt to new domains with minimal annotation is innovative. The integration of domain-specific encoders with a shared meta-explanation module and lightweight adaptation layers represents a novel architecture for XAI transfer. The proposal goes beyond existing work by explicitly modeling shared explanation patterns across diverse domains and providing a comprehensive framework for few-shot adaptation of explanations. The combination of MAML-style training with XAI metrics and human-in-the-loop validation also represents a fresh approach not fully explored in prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The use of MAML for meta-learning is well-justified, and the faithfulness metrics (AOPC, deletion/insertion accuracy, Spearman correlation) are appropriate for evaluating explanation quality. The model architecture with domain encoders, meta-explanation module, and adaptation layers is technically coherent. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in aligning different types of explanations (saliency maps, feature importance vectors, attention weights) into a common representation space, (2) there's limited discussion of how to handle potential negative transfer between domains with very different explanation characteristics, and (3) the mathematical formulation of the meta-loss function could benefit from more detailed explanation of how different explanation types are compared. While these don't invalidate the approach, they represent areas where the technical rigor could be enhanced."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. The data collection requirement is substantial, needing paired datasets from 3-5 source domains with expert annotations, which could be time-consuming and expensive to obtain, especially for specialized domains like legal text with lawyer annotations. The computational requirements for meta-learning across multiple domains with different modalities will likely be significant. The proposal acknowledges the need for human-in-the-loop experiments with domain experts, which adds another layer of complexity and resource requirements. While the technical approach is sound, the practical implementation may be more challenging than anticipated. The timeline is not explicitly stated, making it difficult to assess whether the scope is manageable within a reasonable research period. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential implementation challenges and mitigation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in XAI research with potentially high impact. The ability to transfer explanation capabilities across domains with minimal annotation would significantly advance the field by: (1) reducing the engineering effort required to deploy XAI in new domains, (2) enabling XAI in data-scarce fields where expert annotations are limited, and (3) potentially revealing universal principles of interpretability that could improve XAI standards globally. The practical implications are substantial, potentially accelerating XAI adoption in critical areas like healthcare, finance, and legal domains where transparency is essential but data may be limited. The proposal directly addresses multiple workshop topics, particularly the transferability of insights across use cases and identifying new domains for XAI application. If successful, MetaXplain could fundamentally change how XAI methods are developed and deployed, moving from domain-specific solutions to more universal, adaptable approaches."
