    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on exploring XAI applications across diverse domains and identifying strategies for transferability. The MetaXplain framework specifically targets the challenge of domain-specific tailoring mentioned in the task description and elaborated in Key Challenge 1 of the literature review. The methodology closely follows the outlined approach in the research idea, including the MAML-style meta-learning framework, multi-domain datasets, and evaluation metrics. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant papers and addressing all five key challenges identified. The expected outcomes align perfectly with those mentioned in the research idea, including 5Ã— faster adaptation and reduced annotation burden."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, research gap, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research problem is precisely defined, and the objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the meta-learning framework, including mathematical formulations and implementation details. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact architecture of the base explainer model could be more specifically defined, (2) some technical details about handling different input modalities could be elaborated further, and (3) the proposal could more explicitly address potential challenges in standardizing explanations across diverse domains for meta-learning."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly innovative approach by applying gradient-based meta-learning to the challenge of cross-domain XAI transferability. While meta-learning itself is not new, and some papers in the literature review have conceptually proposed similar ideas (papers #5-#10), this proposal offers a comprehensive and concrete framework that goes beyond existing work. The novelty lies in: (1) the specific application of MAML-style meta-learning to explanation generation across highly diverse domains, (2) the detailed methodology for training a universal explainer model that can rapidly adapt to new domains, (3) the comprehensive evaluation framework that measures both adaptation speed and explanation fidelity, and (4) the focus on reducing annotation burden in new domains. The proposal doesn't claim to invent entirely new algorithms but rather applies and extends existing techniques in a novel way to address a significant challenge in XAI."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with a methodology grounded in established meta-learning techniques and XAI evaluation methods. The MAML-based approach is appropriate for the task, and the mathematical formulations are correct. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that address both quantitative and qualitative aspects of explanation quality. However, there are some areas that could be strengthened: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address the challenge of creating a unified representation for explanations across different modalities (e.g., saliency maps for images vs. feature importance for tabular data), (2) there's limited discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach, (3) the proposal could benefit from more rigorous theoretical analysis of why meta-learning should work for explanation transfer, and (4) while evaluation metrics are mentioned, there could be more discussion about their limitations and potential biases, especially given the meta-evaluation challenges mentioned in paper #3 of the literature review."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach but faces several implementation challenges that are not fully addressed. On the positive side, the methodology leverages existing meta-learning frameworks and libraries, and the experimental design is realistic. However, several practical challenges affect feasibility: (1) obtaining high-quality ground-truth explanations across multiple domains is difficult and expensive, yet crucial for the success of the approach, (2) designing a universal explainer architecture that can handle diverse input modalities (images, text, tabular data) while maintaining a shared explanation core is technically challenging, (3) the computational requirements for meta-training across multiple domains could be substantial, (4) standardizing explanations across domains into a consistent format may be more difficult than acknowledged, and (5) the human evaluation component, while valuable, adds significant complexity and resource requirements. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively suggest that the full implementation as described would require substantial resources and may need to be scaled back or focused on fewer domains initially."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in the field of XAI: the domain-specificity of explanation methods that hinders widespread adoption. If successful, MetaXplain would have substantial impact by: (1) dramatically reducing the time, cost, and data required to deploy XAI in new domains, (2) enabling organizations with limited resources to implement trustworthy AI, (3) promoting more consistent standards for AI explainability across industries, (4) advancing our understanding of which explanation patterns are universal versus domain-specific, and (5) potentially revealing insights about the transferability of XAI methods that could guide future research. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's goal of extending the frontiers of applied XAI and identifying strategies for cross-use-case knowledge transfer. The significance is further enhanced by the practical focus on real-world applications across diverse domains, aligning perfectly with the workshop's emphasis on XAI in action."
