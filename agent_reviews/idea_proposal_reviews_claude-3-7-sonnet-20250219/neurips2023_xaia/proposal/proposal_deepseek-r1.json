    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of exploring XAI applications across domains and identifying transferable strategies. The MetaXplain framework specifically targets the challenge of transferring XAI methods between domains (e.g., from healthcare to finance), which is explicitly mentioned in the task description. The methodology follows the outlined approach in the research idea, including the MAML-style meta-training and evaluation on unseen domains. The proposal also builds upon the literature review, particularly drawing from papers on meta-learning for XAI (papers 1, 2, 5, 6, 7) and addressing the key challenge of 'Domain-Specific Tailoring of XAI Methods' identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate technical details. The mathematical formulations of the meta-learning approach are precise and well-explained. The experimental design, including baselines, metrics, and validation protocol, is thoroughly described. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact relationship between the base model f_θ and explainer g_φ could be more explicitly defined, (2) the specific types of explanations to be generated for each domain could be more detailed, and (3) the integration of human evaluations into the meta-learning framework could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by applying meta-learning specifically to explanation modules, which represents a fresh approach to XAI. The concept of a universal explainer that can rapidly adapt across domains is innovative and addresses a significant gap in current XAI research. The extension of MAML to jointly optimize for prediction accuracy and explanation fidelity is a novel technical contribution. However, the core meta-learning approach builds upon existing techniques (MAML), and some aspects of the proposal overlap with existing work mentioned in the literature review (papers 5, 6, 7). While the application to XAI transferability is novel, the fundamental meta-learning methodology is established, limiting the proposal's groundbreaking nature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates rigorous methodology. The meta-learning framework is well-grounded in established techniques (MAML) and appropriately adapted for the XAI context. The mathematical formulations for the inner loop adaptation and meta-update are correct and clearly presented. The evaluation metrics (AUFC, human evaluations, adaptation efficiency) are appropriate for assessing both technical performance and practical utility. The experimental design includes important controls such as ablation studies and comparisons against established baselines. The validation protocol is comprehensive, covering pre-training, adaptation, and testing phases. One minor limitation is that the proposal could more thoroughly address potential challenges in obtaining ground-truth explanations across diverse domains, which is crucial for the supervised meta-learning approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. The meta-learning approach is well-established, and the extension to explanation modules is technically viable. The data requirements (3-5 source domains, 2 target domains) are reasonable, though collecting expert-annotated explanations across multiple domains may be resource-intensive. The computational requirements for meta-learning are manageable with modern infrastructure. The evaluation protocol is practical and well-defined. However, several challenges may affect feasibility: (1) obtaining consistent ground-truth explanations across diverse domains is difficult, (2) defining a universal explanation representation that works across modalities (images, text, time series) is complex, and (3) the proposed 5× speedup in adaptation may be optimistic without prior empirical validation. These challenges don't render the proposal infeasible but will require careful consideration during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in XAI: the lack of transferability between domains, which creates redundancy, increases costs, and slows adoption. If successful, MetaXplain would have substantial impact across multiple dimensions: (1) Technical impact: establishing a new paradigm for transferable XAI that reduces the annotation burden and accelerates deployment; (2) Practical impact: enabling organizations without domain expertise to deploy interpretable AI systems; (3) Regulatory impact: supporting compliance with emerging AI regulations that mandate explainability; (4) Research impact: spurring new directions in 'explanation-aware' meta-learning. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's goal of identifying transferable strategies for XAI and has the potential to significantly advance the field by bridging domain-specific approaches. The long-term vision of establishing global standards for AI transparency further underscores its significance."
