        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on exploring XAI applications across different domains and identifying ways to transfer insights between use cases. The MetaXplain framework specifically tackles the challenge of domain-specific customization mentioned in the literature review, proposing a meta-learning approach to capture shared 'explanation patterns' across diverse fields. The methodology is comprehensive and includes data collection from multiple domains, meta-training procedures, and evaluation metrics that align with the research idea's outline. The proposal also addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly the issues of domain-specific tailoring of XAI methods and transferability of explanation modules."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The technical details of the meta-learning framework are explained with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the approach understandable. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined evaluation metrics and procedures. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for handling different explanation formats across domains could be more explicitly defined, (2) the relationship between the domain-agnostic feature extractors and domain-specific aspects could be elaborated further, and (3) some of the mathematical notations in the meta-training procedure could be explained more thoroughly for readers less familiar with meta-learning concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel application of meta-learning techniques to the field of explainable AI. While meta-learning itself is not new, and some papers in the literature review have explored meta-learning for XAI in specific contexts (e.g., graph neural networks, algorithm recommendation), the comprehensive framework for transferable explanations across diverse domains represents a fresh approach. The integration of domain adversarial training and contrastive learning to enhance transferability is innovative. However, the core meta-learning approach (MAML) is well-established, and several papers in the literature review have already begun exploring similar concepts of transferable explanation modules and universal explainer networks. The proposal builds upon these existing ideas rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm, which somewhat limits its novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The meta-learning framework is based on well-established principles (MAML) and includes appropriate loss functions and regularization techniques. The explanation evaluation metrics are comprehensive and include both quantitative measures (faithfulness metrics, localization metrics) and qualitative human evaluation. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and controls. The mathematical formulations appear correct and are clearly presented. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes strategies to address them, such as domain adversarial training to encourage domain-invariant features. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) more detailed justification for the choice of specific loss function components and their weights, (2) clearer explanation of how the framework will handle fundamentally different types of explanations across domains, and (3) more discussion of potential failure modes and mitigation strategies."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The data collection strategy is practical, requiring 1,000 samples with expert annotations per domain, which is ambitious but achievable. The meta-learning approach is computationally intensive but within the capabilities of modern research infrastructure. The evaluation methodology is well-designed and includes both automated metrics and human evaluation. However, there are several challenges that may impact feasibility: (1) obtaining expert annotations across multiple domains may be time-consuming and expensive, (2) ensuring consistency in annotation formats across diverse domains will be challenging, (3) the adaptation to fundamentally different explanation types (e.g., from saliency maps to feature importance) may be more difficult than anticipated, and (4) the human evaluation component requiring 20+ domain experts per target domain may be logistically challenging. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they do present significant hurdles that will require careful management."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in the field of XAI: the domain-specific nature of explanation methods and the high cost of adapting them to new domains. If successful, MetaXplain would have substantial impact across multiple dimensions: (1) democratizing access to XAI by reducing the expertise and resources required to implement explanation methods in new domains, (2) accelerating the adoption of XAI in emerging fields where transparency is crucial but expertise is limited, (3) establishing more consistent explanation standards across different domains, and (4) advancing our theoretical understanding of universal explanation principles. The potential for 5Ã— faster adaptation to new domains and significant reduction in annotation burden would represent a major advancement in making AI systems more transparent and trustworthy. The alignment with increasing regulatory demands for explainable AI further enhances its significance. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's goal of identifying strategies to extend the frontiers of applied XAI and make notable progress in this rapidly evolving area."
