    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on exploring XAI applications across different domains and identifying ways to transfer insights between use cases. The MetaXplain framework specifically tackles the challenge of domain-specific tailoring mentioned in the literature review by creating a meta-learning approach that can adapt to new domains with minimal data. The methodology follows the outlined approach in the research idea, including collecting paired datasets from multiple domains, using MAML-style meta-training, and evaluating on unseen domains. The proposal also addresses the data scarcity challenge highlighted in the literature review by reducing the annotation burden through meta-learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the context and motivation for the research. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the meta-learning framework, including mathematical representations of the meta-training and fine-tuning processes. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined, making it clear how the effectiveness of MetaXplain will be assessed. The expected outcomes and potential impact are explicitly stated. However, there could be more specificity about the exact architecture of the explainer model and more details on how the human interpretability evaluations would be conducted. Additionally, while the mathematical formulations are present, they could benefit from more explanation of the variables and their significance for non-experts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by applying meta-learning specifically to XAI in a cross-domain context. While meta-learning itself is not new, and some papers in the literature review (like 'Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Explainable AI' and 'Transferable Explanation Modules for Cross-Domain XAI') suggest similar approaches, this proposal offers a fresh perspective by focusing on a gradient-based MAML-style approach specifically designed for explanation modules. The concept of a 'universal explainer' that can rapidly adapt across domains represents an innovative direction in XAI research. However, the proposal shares similarities with existing approaches mentioned in the literature review, which somewhat limits its groundbreaking nature. The innovation lies more in the specific implementation and application rather than introducing an entirely new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on well-established theoretical foundations. The meta-learning approach is rigorously described with appropriate mathematical formulations for both the meta-training and fine-tuning processes. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, including metrics for adaptation speed, explanation fidelity, and human interpretability. The experimental design includes appropriate comparisons with domain-specific baselines. The proposal also acknowledges existing work in the field through the literature review and builds upon it in a logical manner. However, there could be more discussion about potential limitations of the approach, such as the challenge of finding truly generalizable explanation patterns across vastly different domains, or the computational complexity of the meta-learning process. Additionally, while metrics like LIME and SHAP are mentioned for evaluation, more details on how these would be applied across different domains would strengthen the technical rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps. The meta-learning approach is well-established, and the application to XAI is reasonable. The data collection from 3-5 diverse domains is manageable, though it will require significant effort to obtain paired datasets with expert annotations. The MAML-style meta-training is computationally intensive but achievable with modern resources. The evaluation on two unseen domains is realistic and appropriate for demonstrating the framework's effectiveness. However, there are some challenges that might affect implementation: (1) obtaining high-quality expert annotations across multiple domains could be resource-intensive, (2) ensuring that the meta-learned patterns are truly transferable across very different domains may be difficult, and (3) the claim of 5× faster adaptation would need careful benchmarking. Overall, while ambitious, the proposal is implementable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in XAI: the difficulty of adapting explanation methods to new domains. By developing a meta-learning framework that can rapidly adapt to new domains with minimal data, MetaXplain has the potential to significantly accelerate the adoption of XAI across industries. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of extending the frontiers of applied XAI. The expected outcomes—faster adaptation, comparable or higher fidelity explanations, and reduced annotation burden—would represent meaningful contributions to the field. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in critical domains like healthcare, finance, and law, where interpretability is essential but data may be scarce. By enabling consistent transparency standards across industries, MetaXplain could help bridge the gap between AI's potential and its practical, trustworthy application. The significance is somewhat limited only by the fact that it builds on existing approaches rather than creating an entirely new paradigm."
