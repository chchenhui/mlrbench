        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on deep learning and inverse problems. It directly addresses one of the explicitly mentioned topics: addressing model uncertainty in learning-based solutions for inverse problems. The proposal specifically tackles scenarios where 'we only have access to partial information about the system model' through its Bayesian neural surrogate approach. Additionally, it incorporates diffusion models as priors for solving inverse problems, which is another explicitly mentioned topic of interest. The application domains mentioned (medical tomography, sparse-view CT, multi-coil MRI) also match the workshop's scope perfectly."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating both the problem (lack of accurate forward models) and the proposed solution (two-stage framework with Bayesian neural surrogates). The technical approach is well-defined, explaining how the surrogate captures uncertainty and how it integrates with diffusion models through the expected log-likelihood gradient. The validation domains are clearly specified. Minor ambiguities exist around the specific implementation details of the Bayesian neural surrogate (what architecture, what Bayesian approach) and how exactly the Monte Carlo draws will be performed, but these are reasonable omissions given the space constraints of a research idea summary."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in how it combines several concepts in a unique way. While Bayesian neural networks, diffusion models, and inverse problems have all been studied separately, the integration of Bayesian uncertainty from forward model surrogates directly into the diffusion sampling process appears to be a fresh approach. The replacement of fixed data-consistency terms with expected log-likelihood gradients that account for model uncertainty is particularly innovative. The approach isn't completely revolutionary as it builds upon established methods, but it offers a novel combination that addresses an important gap in current methodologies."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Both Bayesian neural networks and diffusion models are established techniques with available implementations. The integration of uncertainty estimates into diffusion sampling is technically challenging but achievable. The main implementation challenges likely involve: (1) efficiently training Bayesian neural surrogates that accurately capture epistemic uncertainty, (2) computing the expected log-likelihood gradients without excessive computational overhead, and (3) ensuring stable convergence of the modified diffusion sampling process. The validation on CT and MRI is realistic given existing datasets, though acquiring appropriate calibration data with known model mismatches might require careful experimental design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in inverse problems: the assumption of perfect forward models that rarely holds in practice. The significance is particularly high because: (1) it could substantially improve reconstruction quality in medical imaging and other high-stakes applications where model uncertainty is unavoidable, (2) it provides a principled way to quantify uncertainty in reconstructions, which is essential for clinical decision-making and scientific interpretation, (3) it bridges the gap between theoretical diffusion models and practical deployment in real-world scenarios with imperfect physics models, and (4) it generalizes to any inverse problem with partial forward knowledge, making its potential impact very broad across scientific and engineering domains."
