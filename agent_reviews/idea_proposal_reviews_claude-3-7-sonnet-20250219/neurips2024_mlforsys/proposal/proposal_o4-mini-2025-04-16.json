        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the ML for Systems workshop's focus on 'applying ML for compute sustainability, including power/energy/carbon optimization' and specifically tackles 'energy-aware job scheduling' as mentioned in the task. The proposal builds upon the research idea of using LLMs for carbon-aware workload scheduling and incorporates all the key elements mentioned in the idea, including integrating multiple data sources, predicting workload patterns, and implementing continuous learning. The proposal thoroughly references and builds upon the literature review, explicitly mentioning PCAPS, CASPER, CarbonClipper, and CarbonScaler as baselines for comparison. The methodology addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as integrating diverse data sources and balancing performance with carbon reduction."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and numbered, making them easy to follow. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of each component of the GreenSched system, including mathematical formulations for the prediction model, scheduling optimization, and evaluation metrics. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clearly defined baselines, metrics, and statistical analysis approaches. The expected outcomes are quantified with specific targets. However, there are a few areas where additional clarity would be beneficial, such as more details on how the LLM will be specifically trained to understand the relationships between workload characteristics and carbon emissions, and a more explicit discussion of potential limitations of the approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach by leveraging LLMs for carbon-aware scheduling, which distinguishes it from existing work that primarily uses rule-based or classical ML methods. The integration of LLMs to jointly predict energy consumption and service time across candidate datacenters represents a significant innovation in this domain. The continuous learning loop that adapts the model based on actual execution outcomes is also a novel contribution. The proposal explicitly states that 'GreenSched will be the first system to harness the representational power of LLMs' for this purpose, which is supported by the literature review that doesn't mention any existing LLM-based approaches for carbon-aware scheduling. While the basic concept of carbon-aware scheduling isn't new (as evidenced by PCAPS, CASPER, etc.), the application of LLMs to this problem and the unified prediction-optimization framework represent meaningful innovations."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for the prediction model, training objective, and scheduling optimization are well-defined and appropriate for the problem. The experimental design includes multiple baselines, clear metrics, and statistical analysis with confidence intervals. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from further justification or elaboration. For instance, while the proposal claims that LLMs will outperform classical ML methods, it doesn't provide a detailed theoretical justification for why LLMs would be particularly well-suited for this specific task compared to simpler models. Additionally, the proposal could more thoroughly address potential challenges in fine-tuning LLMs on the specific data types involved in this application. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contribution of different components, but more details on how the LLM will handle the heterogeneous input data would strengthen the technical soundness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined implementation details. The use of existing LLM architectures (LLaMA-2 7B with LoRA fine-tuning), publicly available workload traces, and established carbon intensity data sources makes the project practically implementable. The computational requirements seem reasonable, especially with the lightweight optimization step that runs in O(|D|) time. The continuous learning approach is also feasible given the incremental nature of the fine-tuning. However, there are some potential challenges that might affect feasibility. The real-time inference using LLMs might introduce latency that could impact scheduling decisions, especially for time-sensitive workloads. The proposal mentions a sub-10 ms per job scheduling overhead target, which might be ambitious for LLM inference without specialized hardware. Additionally, obtaining accurate real-world measurements of energy consumption and service time for the continuous learning loop might be challenging in production environments. The proposal would benefit from more discussion of these practical implementation challenges and potential mitigation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem with substantial real-world impact. Cloud computing's carbon footprint is a growing concern, and effective carbon-aware scheduling could lead to meaningful reductions in emissions. The expected 15-30% carbon savings beyond existing methods would represent a substantial improvement in sustainability. The proposal clearly articulates both scientific contributions (demonstrating LLMs as unified predictors for spatiotemporal scheduling, novel joint prediction-optimization framework) and practical impact (helping cloud providers meet sustainability goals, reducing carbon taxes). The open-source release of code and datasets would further amplify the impact by enabling broader adoption and extension of the approach. The significance is well-aligned with growing industry and research focus on sustainable computing. The proposal also outlines promising future directions that could further enhance the significance of this work, such as reinforcement learning formulations and integration with spot-market electricity prices."
