    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the ML for Systems workshop's focus on 'applying ML for compute sustainability, including power/energy/carbon optimization' and specifically tackles 'energy-aware job scheduling' as mentioned in the task description. The proposal fully develops the initial idea of using LLMs for carbon-aware workload scheduling in cloud environments, maintaining all core elements while expanding on methodology and evaluation. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with explicit references to works like PCAPS, CASPER, and CarbonScaler, and the proposal addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as integrating diverse data sources and balancing performance with carbon reduction."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations that enhance understanding. The data collection, model architecture, implementation details, and evaluation protocol are all thoroughly described. However, there are a few areas where clarity could be improved: (1) some mathematical notations could benefit from additional explanation for non-experts, (2) the transition between the LLM component and the RL module could be more explicitly connected, and (3) the explanation of how the system handles trade-offs between carbon reduction and SLA compliance could be more detailed. Overall, the main points are understandable and the structure is logical, but these minor ambiguities prevent a perfect score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant originality by combining LLMs with reinforcement learning for carbon-aware scheduling, which represents a novel approach compared to existing methods in the literature. The innovation of using LLMs to understand complex interdependencies between spatiotemporal variables and workload characteristics goes beyond traditional ML or heuristic approaches mentioned in the literature review. The three-part innovation (holistic integration through self-attention, online learning via RL, and interpretability through natural language explanations) differentiates this work from prior solutions like PCAPS and CASPER. However, while innovative, the approach builds upon existing techniques in both LLMs and RL rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms, and the application of LLMs to systems problems is becoming more common, which slightly reduces the novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The methodology section provides detailed mathematical formulations for the LLM context encoding and RL policy optimization, demonstrating technical rigor. The evaluation protocol is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines and metrics. However, there are some areas where the soundness could be improved: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address how the LLM will be trained to understand the specific domain of carbon-aware scheduling, (2) there's limited discussion of potential biases in the training data or how they'll be mitigated, (3) the RL reward function is somewhat simplified and may not capture all the complexities of real-world scheduling decisions, and (4) while the proposal mentions a hybrid scheduling engine with heuristic fallbacks, it doesn't fully explain when and how these fallbacks would be triggered. These gaps in theoretical justification and methodology prevent a higher score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is moderately feasible but presents several implementation challenges. On the positive side, it leverages existing technologies (LLMs, RL) and datasets (Azure Batch Traces, Google Cluster Data), and the evaluation methodology is well-defined. However, several factors limit its feasibility: (1) training and fine-tuning LLMs requires substantial computational resources, which may be prohibitive, (2) obtaining and integrating real-time carbon intensity data across different regions presents data acquisition challenges, (3) the complexity of the combined LLM+RL system may lead to long training times and difficult debugging, (4) deploying such a system in production environments would require significant engineering effort to ensure reliability and performance, and (5) the proposal doesn't fully address how the system would handle edge cases or system failures. While the approach is technically possible, these practical challenges make implementation moderately difficult."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem with substantial real-world impact. Cloud computing's carbon footprint is a growing environmental concern, and effective carbon-aware scheduling could significantly reduce emissions. The proposal quantifies this impact clearly: potential 20-35% carbon emission reductions over state-of-the-art systems, and if deployed across 10% of global public cloud capacity, could reduce annual emissions by 1.5M metric tons (equivalent to removing 326k gasoline cars). The work aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals and addresses regulatory requirements like EU CSRD. The proposal also offers benefits beyond carbon reduction, including cost optimization and improved transparency through natural language explanations. The combination of environmental impact, regulatory alignment, and business benefits makes this research highly significant, with potential for transformative change in how cloud resources are managed."
