        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the topic of 'Responsibility in generative AI for audio/speech/music' from the task description by focusing on watermarking for verifiable TTS synthesis. The proposal fully implements the core idea of steganographic watermarking in TTS models with the three components mentioned in the idea: embedding watermarks in latent spaces, developing differentiable extraction networks, and training watermark-robust speech encoders. The proposal also incorporates the literature effectively, building upon works like XAttnMark, AudioSeal, and psychoacoustic modeling techniques mentioned in the review. The expected outcomes align with the 98% detection accuracy and <1dB distortion metrics mentioned in the idea. The only minor inconsistency is that some references in the proposal (e.g., [3], [4]) don't perfectly match the literature review, but this doesn't significantly impact the overall coherence."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formulations. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the three interconnected modules: watermark embedding, extraction, and zero-shot detection. The experimental design, including datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics, is well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the psychoacoustic masking loss and the overall training objective could be more explicitly connected, (2) some technical details about the diffusion model architecture are assumed rather than explained, and (3) the zero-shot detection approach could be elaborated further to clarify how it generalizes across unseen models. Despite these minor issues, the proposal remains highly understandable and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several innovative components. The core contribution—embedding watermarks directly into the latent space of diffusion-based TTS models—represents a fresh approach compared to post-hoc watermarking methods. The use of psychoacoustic masking loss for imperceptibility and the development of watermark-robust encoders for zero-shot detection are also innovative elements. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing techniques mentioned in the literature review, such as XAttnMark's cross-attention mechanisms and AudioSeal's localized detection. The mathematical formulations for watermark embedding and extraction follow established patterns in the field. While the combination of these elements into a unified framework is novel, each individual component shares similarities with prior work. The proposal offers an innovative synthesis of existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts, placing it in the 'good' rather than 'excellent' category for novelty."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The diffusion-based approach for TTS is grounded in established literature, and the mathematical formulations for watermark embedding and extraction are technically correct. The psychoacoustic masking loss is well-justified for maintaining imperceptibility, and the contrastive learning approach for the watermark-robust encoder is theoretically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets (VCTK, FreeSound), relevant baselines, and comprehensive evaluation metrics covering detection accuracy, imperceptibility, and robustness. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address potential adversarial attacks against the watermarking system, (2) the statistical significance of the expected results isn't discussed, and (3) the theoretical guarantees for watermark extraction under extreme transformations aren't provided. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technology and resources. The use of established datasets (VCTK, FreeSound) and building upon existing diffusion-based TTS models provides a solid foundation. The three-module approach (embedding, extraction, zero-shot detection) allows for incremental development and testing. However, several implementation challenges exist: (1) training diffusion models is computationally expensive and may require significant GPU resources, (2) achieving the targeted performance metrics (98% detection accuracy with <1dB distortion) may be optimistic given the inherent trade-offs between imperceptibility and robustness, (3) the zero-shot detection across unseen generative models presents particular challenges that may require extensive model collections for validation, and (4) the augmentation pipeline with various transformations adds complexity to the training process. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do suggest that additional resources or timeline adjustments might be necessary for full implementation. The proposal acknowledges most technical challenges but could benefit from a more detailed discussion of computational requirements and potential fallback strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI-generated media with far-reaching implications. As synthetic speech becomes increasingly indistinguishable from human speech, the ability to verify the provenance of audio content is essential for maintaining trust in media, protecting individuals from voice identity theft, and enabling responsible AI deployment. The proposed framework would provide a technical solution to these pressing societal challenges. The expected outcomes—a watermarking system with high detection accuracy and minimal quality degradation—would represent a significant advancement in the field. The potential impact spans multiple domains including journalism, legal evidence, content creation, and regulatory compliance. The proposal also contributes to standardization efforts for evaluating watermarking in generative audio, addressing a gap identified in the literature review. The long-term contributions extend beyond TTS to other audio generation tasks. Given the urgency of the problem and the comprehensive nature of the proposed solution, this work has the potential to make a substantial contribution to responsible AI development in the audio domain."
