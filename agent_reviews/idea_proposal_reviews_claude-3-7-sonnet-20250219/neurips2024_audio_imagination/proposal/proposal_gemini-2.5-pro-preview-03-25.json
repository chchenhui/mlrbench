    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the NeurIPS Audio Imagination Workshop's focus on text-to-speech synthesis, evaluation methods, and responsibility in generative AI for audio. The proposal comprehensively incorporates the core concept from the research idea of integrating steganographic watermarking into TTS models for verifiable synthesis, maintaining the key objectives of imperceptibility (<1dB distortion) and high detection accuracy (>98%). The methodology thoroughly builds upon the literature review, citing relevant works like XAttnMark for psychoacoustic masking, AudioSeal for watermarking techniques, and WavLM for detection approaches. The proposal also addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as the imperceptibility vs. robustness trade-off and integration with generative models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The technical approach is explained with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the diffusion model integration and watermarking process understandable. The evaluation metrics and experimental design are comprehensively detailed. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for how the watermark embedding affects the diffusion process could be more precisely defined, (2) The relationship between the imperceptibility loss and the standard diffusion loss could be further elaborated, and (3) Some technical details about the zero-shot detection module's architecture could be more specific. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly clear and well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. First, it introduces a novel approach to integrate watermarking directly into the latent space of diffusion-based TTS models, rather than applying watermarking as a post-processing step. Second, the combination of a dedicated watermark extractor with a zero-shot detection module represents an innovative dual-verification approach not commonly seen in the literature. Third, the use of psychoacoustic principles to guide the watermark embedding process within the diffusion model's generation pipeline is a fresh perspective. While individual components like audio watermarking, diffusion TTS models, and deepfake detection have been explored separately in the literature, their integration into a cohesive framework for verifiable synthesis represents a novel contribution. The proposal builds upon existing work (e.g., XAttnMark, AudioSeal) but extends these approaches in meaningful ways, particularly in the context of diffusion models."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness overall. The diffusion model formulation is mathematically correct, and the watermarking approach is grounded in established principles of steganography and psychoacoustics. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, with appropriate metrics for audio quality, watermark imperceptibility, robustness, and detection accuracy. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The mathematical formulation of how the watermark embedding vector e_w specifically influences the diffusion process could be more rigorously defined, (2) The proposal mentions but doesn't fully elaborate on potential security vulnerabilities of the watermarking scheme against adversarial attacks, (3) The trade-offs between watermark payload size, robustness, and imperceptibility could be more thoroughly analyzed. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and well-justified, with clear connections to established methods in the literature."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic objectives. The use of publicly available datasets (VCTK, LibriTTS) and established model architectures (diffusion models, WavLM/HuBERT) provides a solid foundation. The evaluation metrics and experimental design are well-defined and achievable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) The computational resources required for training diffusion models are substantial, and the addition of watermarking components may further increase this burden, (2) Achieving both high imperceptibility (<1dB distortion) and high robustness (>98% detection accuracy) simultaneously may be challenging given the inherent trade-offs, (3) The zero-shot detection module's ability to generalize across different watermarking keys and models is ambitious and may require extensive experimentation to achieve. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential mitigation strategies. Overall, the research is feasible but will require careful implementation and possibly some scope adjustments during execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical and timely challenge in the field of generative AI for audio. As synthetic speech becomes increasingly indistinguishable from human speech, the ability to verify the origin and authenticity of audio content has profound implications for information integrity, security, and trust. The research directly tackles the societal risks posed by audio deepfakes, offering a proactive rather than reactive approach to detection and verification. The potential impact spans multiple domains: (1) Scientific: advancing the integration of security mechanisms within generative models, (2) Technological: providing practical tools for content verification and provenance tracking, (3) Societal: combating misinformation and fraud while enabling responsible use of powerful TTS technologies. The proposal aligns perfectly with the growing emphasis on responsible AI development and could establish important benchmarks and standards for the field. The work could influence how TTS systems are developed and deployed in the future, potentially becoming a standard requirement for ethical AI systems."
