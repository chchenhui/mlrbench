        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the Audio Imagination workshop's focus on responsible AI for audio generation by proposing a steganographic watermarking framework for TTS systems. The proposal comprehensively incorporates the key challenges identified in the literature review, including the imperceptibility vs. robustness trade-off, integration with generative models, detection accuracy, and standardization. It builds upon recent works like XAttnMark (2025) and AudioSeal (2024) while addressing their limitations. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposed approach extends diffusion-based TTS models with cross-attention watermarking layers, which aligns perfectly with the research idea of embedding imperceptible identifiers during synthesis."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and motivation. The methodology section provides detailed mathematical formulations for the watermarking approach, including specific equations for the diffusion process and cross-attention mechanism. The evaluation metrics and expected outcomes are clearly defined with quantitative targets. However, there are a few minor areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the relationship between the watermark code w and the actual metadata being embedded could be more explicitly defined, (2) some technical details about the Provenance-ResNet101 encoder architecture could be elaborated, and (3) the transition between different training stages could be more thoroughly explained. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is logically organized and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating steganographic watermarking directly into the diffusion-based TTS generation pipeline, rather than applying it as a post-processing step. This represents a significant advancement over existing approaches like XAttnMark (2025), which the authors acknowledge as a foundation but differentiate from by emphasizing the tight integration with the generation process. The cross-attention watermarking mechanism for diffusion models appears to be a novel contribution. However, the core concepts of audio watermarking and using cross-attention for conditioning are not entirely new, as evidenced by the cited literature. The zero-shot detection capability using watermark-robust encoders is innovative but builds incrementally on existing work. While the proposal offers a fresh combination of techniques and a new application context, it doesn't represent a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift in the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The mathematical formulations for the diffusion process and cross-attention watermarking are correctly presented and build upon established techniques. The three-component loss function (perceptual, robustness, and adversarial) is well-justified and aligns with best practices in the field. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, using standard metrics (PESQ, FAD, STOI) and following established protocols like ITU-T Rec. P.800 for robustness testing. The statistical significance assessment using bootstrap sampling and Benjamini-Hochberg correction shows rigorous attention to experimental validity. The training protocol with its staged approach is logical and well-structured. The only minor limitations are: (1) some assumptions about the effectiveness of the cross-attention mechanism for watermarking could benefit from additional theoretical justification, and (2) the exact architecture of the watermark detector could be more thoroughly specified. Overall, the technical foundations are solid and the approach is rigorous."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic goals and implementation steps. The use of established datasets (VCTK-Corpus, LJSpeech) and standard preprocessing techniques makes the initial setup straightforward. The extension of existing diffusion-based TTS models with cross-attention layers is technically feasible given current deep learning frameworks. The staged training protocol is practical and allows for incremental development and testing. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require significant effort: (1) achieving the targeted 98% watermark detection accuracy with <1dB distortion is ambitious and may require extensive hyperparameter tuning, (2) ensuring robustness against the wide range of attacks specified will be challenging, and (3) the zero-shot detection capability may require more sophisticated training strategies than outlined. The computational resources needed for training diffusion models are substantial but within reach of typical research environments. Overall, while the proposal is implementable with current technology and methods, it will require considerable expertise and resources to achieve all stated goals."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the field of AI-generated speech: the lack of robust frameworks for verifying the provenance of synthetic audio. This has significant implications for media trustworthiness, personal identity security, and legal integrity in an era of increasingly convincing audio deepfakes. The expected outcomes—including high-accuracy watermark detection, improved robustness against compression, and zero-shot detection capabilities—would represent meaningful advances in responsible AI deployment. The proposed open-source toolkit integration with HuggingFace's TTS pipeline could have substantial practical impact by standardizing provenance tracking across popular frameworks. The societal and legal impacts outlined, such as enabling forensic verification for journalism and supporting legal compliance with regulations like the EU AI Act, demonstrate the broader significance beyond technical contributions. While the approach is focused specifically on TTS systems rather than addressing all forms of audio generation, its potential impact on establishing standards for responsible AI in this domain is considerable."
