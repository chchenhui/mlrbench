    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Responsibility in generative AI for audio/speech/music' topic from the task description by developing a watermarking framework for TTS models. The proposal faithfully implements the core idea of steganographic watermarking for verifiable synthesis, including all key components mentioned in the research idea: embedding imperceptible identifiers, developing extraction networks, and training robust speech encoders. The methodology also incorporates insights from the literature review, particularly drawing on techniques from papers like XAttnMark, AudioSeal, and diffusion-based TTS with integrated watermarking. The expected outcomes (98% detection accuracy with <1dB distortion) match exactly what was outlined in the research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with distinct components. The architecture is well-defined with five specific components, and the experimental design outlines a clear step-by-step process. The evaluation metrics are precisely defined, making it easy to understand how success will be measured. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism of how the watermark code is generated and what information it contains could be more detailed, (2) the specific architecture of the watermark extraction network could be elaborated further, and (3) more details on the training procedure and loss functions would strengthen the technical rigor of the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating steganographic watermarking directly into the latent space of diffusion-based TTS models, which represents a fresh approach compared to post-processing watermarking methods. The combination of watermark embedding during synthesis with differentiable extraction networks and zero-shot detection capabilities offers a novel end-to-end framework. However, the core techniques build upon existing work in audio watermarking and diffusion models rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The literature review shows that similar approaches like AudioSeal and diffusion-based TTS with integrated watermarking already exist, though this proposal appears to combine these ideas in a more comprehensive framework. The novelty lies more in the integration and application rather than in developing entirely new technical methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on established foundations in diffusion models, steganography, and speech synthesis. The architecture components are well-justified, and the evaluation metrics are appropriate for measuring both watermark effectiveness and audio quality. The use of standard datasets (VCTK and FS2) strengthens the experimental design. However, there are some gaps in the technical rigor: (1) the proposal lacks mathematical formulations for the watermark embedding and extraction processes, (2) there's limited discussion of potential adversarial attacks and how the system would resist them, (3) the trade-off between imperceptibility and robustness (identified as a key challenge in the literature review) is acknowledged but not thoroughly addressed in the methodology. While the overall approach is sound, these technical details would need to be developed further to ensure complete rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible with current technology and resources. It builds on existing diffusion-based TTS models and uses standard datasets (VCTK and FS2) that are readily available. The components of the architecture (text encoder, watermark encoder, diffusion model, extraction network, and robust speech encoder) all utilize established neural network techniques. The evaluation metrics are measurable and quantifiable. The target of 98% detection accuracy with <1dB distortion is ambitious but not unrealistic given recent advances in the field, as evidenced by the literature review. The experimental design outlines a clear implementation path. The main implementation challenges would be in fine-tuning the balance between watermark robustness and audio quality, but these are manageable with current deep learning techniques and computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem with far-reaching implications. As synthetic speech becomes increasingly indistinguishable from human speech, the ability to verify the provenance of audio content is essential for maintaining trust in digital media. The impact spans multiple domains including journalism, legal systems, personal identity protection, and AI ethics. By providing a standardized framework for verifiable synthesis, this research directly contributes to responsible AI deployment - a key concern identified in the task description. The potential to achieve high detection accuracy with minimal audio distortion would represent a significant advancement over current methods. The approach also enables accountability without restricting the beneficial applications of TTS technology, striking an important balance between innovation and responsibility. The democratization of voice creation tools with embedded accountability would be particularly impactful for the broader adoption of these technologies."
