        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the 'Responsibility in generative AI for audio/speech/music' topic by proposing a steganographic watermarking framework for text-to-speech models. It also touches on 'Methods for Evaluation of Generated Audio' through its watermark detection metrics. The proposal specifically targets text-to-speech synthesis, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest in the workshop description. The focus on mitigating deepfake risks and ensuring ethical deployment aligns perfectly with the workshop's interest in responsible AI applications for audio generation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a specific problem (audio deepfakes), a proposed solution (steganographic watermarking in TTS latent spaces), and expected outcomes (98% detection accuracy with <1dB distortion). The technical approach is well-defined, mentioning diffusion models conditioned on text and watermark codes, with specific components like watermark extraction networks. The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details of how the watermarking would be implemented in the latent space and how the differentiable extraction networks would function, which would benefit from further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining steganographic watermarking techniques with modern TTS diffusion models in a way that appears to be underexplored. While watermarking itself is not new in digital media, the specific application to TTS latent spaces and the creation of content-specific identifiers tied to prompts, authors, and timestamps represents a fresh approach. The integration of watermarking directly into the generation pipeline rather than as a post-processing step is innovative. However, similar watermarking approaches have been explored in other generative domains like images and text, so the core concept is an adaptation rather than a completely new paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology. Diffusion models for TTS are well-established, and steganographic techniques have been successfully applied in other domains. The proposal builds on existing methods and datasets (VCTK/FS2), suggesting practical implementability. The specified performance metrics (98% detection accuracy with <1dB distortion) seem ambitious but potentially achievable given recent advances in audio processing. The main implementation challenges would likely be in ensuring the watermarks remain robust against common audio transformations and attacks while maintaining imperceptibility, but these challenges appear surmountable with current techniques."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical and timely problem with substantial real-world impact. Audio deepfakes pose genuine threats to media trust, journalism integrity, and personal security. The proposed framework could establish much-needed standards for verifying synthetic audio provenance, directly addressing an urgent gap in responsible AI deployment. The significance extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in journalism, legal systems, and content creation tools. By enabling attribution and verification while preserving creative capabilities, this work could help shape ethical guidelines and technical standards for the entire field of generative audio, potentially influencing policy and industry practices."
