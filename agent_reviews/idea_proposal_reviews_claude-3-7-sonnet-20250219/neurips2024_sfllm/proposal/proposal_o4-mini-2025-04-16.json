    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for statistical tools for black-box models as specified in the task, focusing specifically on conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification in LLMs. The proposal elaborates comprehensively on the semantic conformal prediction framework outlined in the research idea, maintaining consistency in approach and objectives. It builds upon the literature review by acknowledging existing works (ConU, Conformal Language Modeling) while addressing identified gaps in black-box uncertainty quantification. The methodology section clearly extends the core idea with detailed algorithms, evaluation metrics, and experimental design that align with both the task requirements and the cited literature. The only minor inconsistency is that some papers mentioned in the literature review (particularly papers 5-10) aren't explicitly referenced in the proposal, though their concepts are incorporated."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is presented with precise mathematical formulations. The algorithms are clearly defined with step-by-step procedures, making implementation straightforward. The experimental design section thoroughly outlines datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) The transition between calibration and prediction phases could be more explicit about how the calibration set is used in prediction; (2) The notation in Algorithm 2 could be more consistent with the mathematical formulations; and (3) The explanation of how chain-of-thought reasoning is embedded and evaluated could be more detailed. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing Semantic Conformal Prediction Sets (SCPS) as a novel approach to uncertainty quantification in black-box LLMs. The key innovation lies in leveraging semantic embedding spaces to define nonconformity scores without requiring access to model internals. While conformal prediction itself is not new (as evidenced by ConU and other works in the literature review), the application to semantic embeddings for black-box LLMs and the extension to chain-of-thought reasoning represent fresh perspectives. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by emphasizing its task-agnostic nature and black-box applicability. However, it builds incrementally on existing conformal prediction frameworks rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm. The nearest-neighbor approximation and domain transfer experiments add innovative elements, but the core methodology follows established conformal prediction principles."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulation of the conformal prediction framework is correct and well-presented, with proper notation and clear definitions of nonconformity scores, thresholds, and prediction sets. The statistical guarantees are properly derived from conformal prediction theory, ensuring finite-sample coverage under the exchangeability assumption. The methodology is well-justified with appropriate references to established techniques in both conformal prediction and semantic embeddings. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-chosen baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies are thoughtfully designed to test key components of the approach. One minor limitation is that the proposal doesn't fully address potential violations of the exchangeability assumption when applying the method across different domains or tasks. Additionally, while the chain-of-thought extension is interesting, its theoretical guarantees could be more rigorously established. Overall, the proposal demonstrates sound statistical reasoning and methodological rigor."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible with current resources and technology. It relies on established components: (1) existing LLM APIs for generating outputs, (2) pre-trained sentence embedding models like Sentence-BERT, and (3) standard conformal prediction algorithms. The computational requirements are reasonable, with the proposal acknowledging potential efficiency challenges and offering solutions like nearest-neighbor approximations. The calibration dataset sizes (500-5000 examples) are practical and attainable. The experimental design is comprehensive but manageable, covering multiple tasks and models without requiring prohibitive resources. The implementation path is clearly defined with explicit algorithms. One potential challenge is the collection of high-quality calibration data across diverse domains, which might require significant effort. Additionally, the chain-of-thought extension might face practical challenges in defining appropriate discourse encoders and evaluating reasoning chains. Nevertheless, these challenges are acknowledged and don't significantly impact the overall feasibility of the core approach."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety and trustworthiness: providing reliable uncertainty quantification for black-box LLMs. This is particularly important as LLMs are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. The expected contributions are substantial: (1) a framework with provable coverage guarantees for black-box LLMs, (2) reduction in hallucination rates by 15-30%, and (3) extensions to chain-of-thought reasoning for auditing purposes. The broader impact section convincingly argues for applications in risk-aware human-AI collaboration, regulatory compliance, and model auditing. The significance is enhanced by the method's applicability to any black-box LLM API, making it widely accessible to practitioners without requiring access to model internals. While the approach may not be transformative to the field of conformal prediction itself, its application to black-box LLMs and potential impact on safe AI deployment represent a significant contribution to responsible AI development."
