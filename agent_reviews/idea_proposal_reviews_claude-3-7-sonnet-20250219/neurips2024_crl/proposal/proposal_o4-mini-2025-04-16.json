    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of integrating causal relationships into generative models, specifically diffusion models, which is central to the workshop's focus on causal representation learning. The proposal builds upon the literature review by extending concepts from DeCaFlow, CausalBGM, and C2VAE into the diffusion model framework. The methodology section clearly incorporates the structural equation modeling approach mentioned in the literature while adapting it to the diffusion process. The proposal also addresses all key challenges identified in the literature review: identifying latent causal variables, handling confounders, ensuring interpretability, robustness to distribution shifts, and computational efficiency. The only minor gap is that while the proposal mentions potential applications in healthcare and other domains, it could have more explicitly connected to some of the application areas mentioned in the workshop topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented with appropriate mathematical formalism. The three core components of the model architecture (encoder/decoder, causal discovery module, and causally-guided diffusion process) are well-defined with clear equations and explanations. The experimental design section provides comprehensive details on baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are a few areas where clarity could be improved: (1) The relationship between the latent code z and the causal variables could be more explicitly defined early in the methodology; (2) The exact mechanism by which the causal graph G(A) conditions the noise predictor ε_θ could be elaborated further; and (3) The proposal could benefit from a visual representation of the overall architecture to help readers better understand the integration of the causal discovery module with the diffusion process."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of causal discovery and representation learning with diffusion models, which represents a significant advancement over existing approaches. The key innovation lies in the causally-guided diffusion process that incorporates the learned causal structure directly into the denoising steps (equation 3). This approach differs from prior work like DeCaFlow and C2VAE by embedding causal structure into a continuous-time generative process rather than a one-step generation framework. The modification of the reverse diffusion process to incorporate causal structural corrections is particularly innovative. While the individual components (diffusion models, NOTEARS-style causal discovery) build upon existing techniques, their combination and adaptation for causal representation learning in high-dimensional data represents a fresh approach. The proposal could have scored higher if it had proposed more novel theoretical contributions to causal identifiability or presented entirely new algorithms for causal discovery rather than adapting existing ones."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness with well-founded methodology. The mathematical formulations for the causal discovery module and diffusion process are correctly presented and build upon established techniques like NOTEARS and DDPMs. The overall objective function (equation 5) appropriately combines the diffusion loss with the causal discovery constraints. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. However, there are some limitations to the soundness: (1) The linear SEM assumption may be too restrictive for complex real-world data, though the authors acknowledge this as future work; (2) The proposal does not thoroughly address identifiability conditions for the latent causal variables, which is a critical aspect of causal representation learning; (3) The causal injection term κA^Tz_t in equation 3 lacks theoretical justification for why this specific form would enforce causal consistency; and (4) The proposal could benefit from more rigorous analysis of how the joint optimization of diffusion and causal discovery objectives affects convergence properties."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined components and evaluation strategy. The implementation leverages existing frameworks (PyTorch) and established techniques (DDPM, NOTEARS), making the technical implementation realistic. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets ranging from synthetic benchmarks to real-world applications, and the evaluation metrics are well-chosen to assess different aspects of the model's performance. However, several challenges may affect feasibility: (1) The joint optimization of diffusion models and causal discovery is computationally intensive and may require significant computational resources; (2) The acyclicity constraint in equation 2 is known to be difficult to optimize in practice, especially at scale; (3) The proposal assumes access to interventional data in some experiments, which may be limited in real-world settings; and (4) The alternating optimization procedure between encoder parameters and causal graph structure may face convergence issues. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they represent significant hurdles that would need careful handling during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current generative AI systems by integrating causal reasoning into diffusion models, which has significant implications for both theoretical advancement and practical applications. From a theoretical perspective, CDMs extend causal representation learning to continuous-time generative processes, potentially opening new research directions in causally-aware generative modeling. Practically, the ability to perform controlled interventions on specific latent factors would be valuable in domains like healthcare, where generating counterfactual medical images could aid in diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical education. The proposal's focus on improving robustness to distribution shifts and confounding also addresses key limitations of current generative models. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on specific application domains and the reliance on linear SEMs, but the potential impact on trustworthy AI development and causal representation learning is substantial. The proposal aligns well with the growing emphasis on interpretable and reliable AI systems in critical applications."
