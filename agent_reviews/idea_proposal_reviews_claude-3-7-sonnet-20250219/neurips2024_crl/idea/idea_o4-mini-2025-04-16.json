        "justification": "The CausalDiff proposal aligns excellently with the Causal Representation Learning Workshop's focus. It directly addresses the workshop's core concern of identifying causal relationships in latent spaces when handling complex data like images. The proposal specifically targets the integration of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) into diffusion models to capture causal relationships rather than mere dependencies. It aims to enhance interpretability and reliability of generative models through causal disentanglement, which perfectly matches the workshop's goal of exploring techniques that 'identify latent causal variables and discern the relationships among them.' The proposal also fits within multiple listed topics, including causal representation learning models, causal generative models, and applications of causal representation learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The CausalDiff idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (diffusion models ignoring cause-effect structure), the proposed solution (integrating SCMs into the diffusion process), the technical approach (using GNNs to parameterize adjacency matrices and causal mechanisms), and the evaluation strategy (testing on synthetic and real-world datasets). The training methodology involving intervention-aware contrastive losses is well-explained. The only minor ambiguities are in the specific details of how the variational ELBO is augmented with contrastive losses and how exactly the ancestral sampling integrates with the diffusion decoder during inference. These technical details would benefit from further elaboration, but the overall concept is well-articulated and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "CausalDiff presents a highly novel integration of two powerful frameworks: diffusion models and structural causal models. While both diffusion models and causal representation learning exist separately, their combination in this manner appears to be innovative. The use of intervention-aware contrastive losses to disentangle cause and effect during training is particularly original. The approach of using a GNN to parameterize a learnable adjacency matrix in latent space is also innovative. The idea doesn't completely reinvent either diffusion models or causal learning, but it creates a new synthesis that could potentially address significant limitations in current generative AI. The approach of using synthetic interventions to infer causal direction is clever and builds upon existing causal discovery techniques in a new context."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The core components—diffusion models and graph neural networks—are well-established with available implementations. Testing on synthetic datasets with known SCMs (dSprites, 3DShapes) is practical and provides a clear validation path. However, several challenges exist: (1) Learning causal structures in high-dimensional latent spaces is notoriously difficult; (2) The intervention-aware contrastive losses may require careful tuning to avoid mode collapse or instability; (3) Evaluating causal correctness on real-world image datasets without ground truth causal graphs will be challenging; (4) The computational requirements for joint optimization of both the SCM and diffusion model could be substantial. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the idea impractical—rather, they represent reasonable research hurdles that could be overcome with careful experimental design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "CausalDiff addresses a fundamental limitation in current generative AI systems: their inability to model causal relationships. This limitation impacts reliability, interpretability, and robustness—all critical concerns for deploying AI in high-stakes domains. If successful, this research could significantly advance several important areas: (1) Enable more reliable generative models that maintain coherence under distribution shifts; (2) Improve interpretability by providing explicit causal structures; (3) Allow for meaningful interventions in generative processes, which is crucial for scientific modeling and simulation; (4) Address fairness concerns by disentangling spurious correlations from causal factors. The potential applications span scientific modeling, healthcare, fairness-critical domains, and robust AI systems. The work could bridge the gap between the impressive capabilities of modern generative models and the causal understanding needed for truly reliable AI."
