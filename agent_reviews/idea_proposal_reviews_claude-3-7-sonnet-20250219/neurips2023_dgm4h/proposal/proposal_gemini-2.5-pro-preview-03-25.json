    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on deep generative models for health applications, specifically leveraging diffusion models to tackle multimodal healthcare diagnostics. The proposal incorporates key elements from the research idea, including the hierarchical architecture with modality-specific encoders, shared latent space, and adaptive training strategy with modality masking. It thoroughly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, such as data scarcity, multimodal integration, missing modalities, and explainability. The proposal cites relevant literature appropriately and builds upon existing work like MedM2G and MedCoDi-M. The only minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions addressing rare diseases and underrepresented populations, it could have elaborated more specifically on how the approach would benefit these particular groups."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical details of the RMDM architecture are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the diffusion process and training strategy understandable. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined tasks, baselines, evaluation scenarios, and metrics. The proposal effectively communicates the problem, solution, and potential impact. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the diffusion process and the diagnostic task could be more explicitly explained - whether the diffusion model is directly producing diagnoses or generating representations for a downstream classifier; (2) Some technical details about the fusion mechanism could be more precisely defined; (3) The proposal occasionally uses complex sentences that could be simplified for better readability."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel combination of existing concepts rather than a fundamentally new approach. Its originality lies in the specific application of diffusion models to multimodal healthcare diagnostics with a focus on robustness to missing modalities. The adaptive training strategy with deliberate modality masking is innovative in the context of diffusion models for healthcare. The hierarchical fusion mechanism and the integration of domain knowledge through specialized attention mechanisms also contribute to the novelty. However, many of the core components build directly upon existing work in multimodal fusion, diffusion models, and robustness techniques. The proposal acknowledges this by citing relevant prior work like MedM2G and MedCoDi-M. While the combination and healthcare-specific adaptations are valuable, the proposal doesn't introduce a fundamentally new generative modeling paradigm or fusion technique."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The diffusion model formulation is mathematically correct and follows established principles. The multimodal fusion approach is grounded in current best practices, and the adaptive training strategy is logically designed to address the missing modality challenge. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, evaluation scenarios, and metrics that will effectively test the claims. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and includes multiple evaluation metrics to ensure robust assessment. The technical formulations are mostly correct, though some details about the exact implementation of the fusion mechanism could be more precisely defined. The proposal could also benefit from more discussion of potential failure modes or theoretical limitations of the approach. Overall, the methodology is rigorous and well-justified, with a clear path from theory to implementation and evaluation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, but with some implementation challenges. The use of publicly available datasets (MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-CXR, TCGA, CheXpert) is practical and appropriate. The technical approach builds on established methods in diffusion models and multimodal fusion, which increases feasibility. However, several aspects present challenges: (1) Computational requirements for training diffusion models on large multimodal medical datasets are substantial, requiring significant GPU resources; (2) The complexity of implementing and debugging the hierarchical fusion mechanism and adaptive training strategy may be time-consuming; (3) The proposal acknowledges the need for clinical expertise to evaluate interpretability, which may be difficult to secure; (4) Working with multiple modalities across different datasets introduces data preprocessing and alignment challenges. While these challenges don't make the project infeasible, they do increase its complexity and resource requirements. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed timeline and resource allocation plan to address these challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses significant challenges in healthcare AI with potentially high impact. The problem of robust multimodal integration for medical diagnostics, especially under conditions of missing data, is critically important for real-world clinical applications. If successful, the RMDM framework could meaningfully improve diagnostic accuracy for complex cases and rare diseases, contributing to better patient outcomes. The focus on robustness to missing modalities directly addresses a key barrier to clinical adoption of AI systems. The proposal's emphasis on interpretability also enhances its potential impact by making the system more trustworthy for clinicians. The work could advance the state of the art in generative models for healthcare and provide a foundation for future research. While the immediate clinical impact might be limited by regulatory and implementation barriers not fully addressed in the proposal, the methodological contributions and potential long-term impact on healthcare AI are substantial."
