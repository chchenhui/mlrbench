        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses preference-based learning in healthcare, which is explicitly mentioned as one of the application areas in the task description. The proposal combines multi-objective optimization and reinforcement learning, both of which are listed as relevant topics. The idea of learning from clinicians' preferences rather than numerical rewards perfectly captures the core premise mentioned in the task description that 'humans are more reliable at providing relative feedback compared to numerical values.' The proposal also connects theory to practice by identifying a real-world healthcare system that can benefit from preference feedback, which directly addresses the second broad objective of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (multiple conflicting objectives in healthcare decisions), the limitations of current approaches (difficulty in defining numerical reward functions), and the proposed solution (combining multi-objective optimization with preference-based RL). The methodology is well-explained: maintaining a Pareto front of policies, collecting preferences from clinicians on treatment trajectories, and learning a distribution over objective weights. The application domain (medication dosing for chronic conditions) is also specified. However, some minor details could be further elaborated, such as the specific algorithm for learning the weight distribution from preferences and how the system would adapt to individual patient priorities versus general physician expertise."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining two established approaches (multi-objective optimization and preference-based RL) in a novel way for healthcare applications. While both preference-based learning and multi-objective optimization exist separately, their integration specifically for healthcare decision support represents a fresh approach. The concept of learning a distribution over objective weights from clinician preferences, rather than asking for direct numerical weights, is particularly innovative. However, the core technical components (Pareto fronts, preference elicitation) are established techniques, and similar combinations have been explored in other domains, which prevents it from receiving the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible with current technology and methods. The components required (multi-objective RL algorithms, preference learning methods, Pareto optimization) all exist and have been implemented separately. Healthcare data for chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension is available, and clinician preferences can be collected through established methods. However, there are moderate challenges: obtaining sufficient high-quality preference data from busy clinicians may be difficult; the computational complexity of maintaining Pareto fronts in high-dimensional objective spaces could be substantial; and validating the approach in real clinical settings would require careful ethical considerations and possibly regulatory approvals. These challenges are significant but not insurmountable, justifying a good but not perfect feasibility score."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research idea is very high. Healthcare decision-making is an area where improved AI support could have substantial real-world impact, potentially improving patient outcomes while reducing costs and side effects. The multi-objective nature of the approach addresses a fundamental limitation in current clinical decision support systems. By capturing the implicit trade-offs made by experienced clinicians, the system could help standardize care while still allowing for personalization. The approach also has potential to improve transparency in AI healthcare systems by explicitly representing different objectives rather than using a single opaque reward function. If successful, this research could influence how AI is applied across various healthcare domains and potentially extend to other fields with similar multi-objective decision problems."
