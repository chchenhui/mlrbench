    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on preference-based learning in healthcare, specifically targeting multi-objective optimization and reinforcement learning - both explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposal faithfully expands on the research idea of combining multi-objective optimization with preference-based RL for clinical decision support, maintaining the core concept of learning from clinician preferences to navigate trade-offs between competing healthcare objectives. The methodology thoroughly incorporates recent literature cited in the review, including references to preference transformers, fairness considerations, offline learning approaches, and human-in-the-loop policy optimization. The proposal addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as balancing multiple objectives, eliciting accurate preferences, and ensuring interpretability. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review emphasizes data scarcity as a challenge, the proposal could have more explicitly addressed this issue in its methodology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem formulation to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is presented in a detailed, step-by-step manner with appropriate mathematical formulations. The problem of multi-objective preference-based RL in healthcare is well-defined, and the proposed approach is explained thoroughly. The experimental design section provides clear information about datasets, baselines, evaluation metrics, and protocols. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the N weight samples and the resulting policies could be more explicitly explained for non-experts; (2) The information-theoretic approach to selecting trajectory pairs for clinician feedback could be elaborated; and (3) Some technical details about the Bayesian sampling methods for posterior approximation could be more specific. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. It introduces a novel integration of multi-objective optimization with preference-based RL specifically tailored for healthcare decision-making, which represents a fresh approach not fully explored in the cited literature. The framework's ability to maintain a distribution over weight vectors rather than committing to a fixed scalarization is innovative, as is the method for approximating the Pareto front through preference elicitation. The proposal extends beyond existing work by explicitly modeling the uncertainty in clinician preferences and using this to guide policy learning. While individual components (preference-based RL, multi-objective optimization) exist in the literature, their combination and application to chronic disease management represents a novel contribution. The proposal builds upon recent work like Li & Guo (2024) and Harland et al. (2024) but extends these approaches with healthcare-specific considerations and a more comprehensive framework for preference elicitation and policy adaptation. The novelty is somewhat constrained by the fact that it primarily combines existing techniques rather than developing fundamentally new algorithms, but the integration and application domain represent meaningful innovation."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor throughout. The problem formulation as a multi-objective MDP with vector-valued rewards is mathematically precise and appropriate for the healthcare context. The preference elicitation model using the Bradley-Terry-Luce framework is well-established in the literature and correctly applied here. The policy learning approach using actor-critic architecture with weight-specific critics is technically sound and builds on proven reinforcement learning methods. The Bayesian approach to maintaining a posterior over weights is theoretically well-grounded. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics (hypervolume indicator, inverse generational distance), and protocols for evaluation. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes sensitivity analyses to test robustness. The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented, with proper notation and definitions. The only minor limitation is that the proposal could provide more details on how the transition probabilities will be learned from historical data, particularly given the challenges of healthcare data. Overall, the technical approach is rigorous, well-justified, and builds appropriately on established methods in reinforcement learning and preference modeling."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, the methodology builds on established techniques in reinforcement learning and preference modeling, and the authors propose using both real EHR data and validated physiological simulators, which is a practical approach. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, several feasibility concerns exist: (1) Collecting sufficient high-quality preference data from busy clinicians may be challenging and time-consuming; (2) The computational complexity of maintaining multiple policies and approximating the Pareto front could be substantial; (3) Access to large, high-quality EHR datasets with the necessary granularity for chronic disease management may be difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns; (4) The proposal requires expertise across multiple domains (RL, multi-objective optimization, healthcare, Bayesian inference); (5) The online preference elicitation phase may face practical implementation barriers in clinical settings. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they represent significant hurdles that would require careful planning and potentially additional resources to overcome. The proposal would benefit from more explicit discussion of these implementation challenges and potential mitigation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in healthcare AI: developing decision support systems that can handle the complex, multi-objective nature of clinical decision-making while aligning with clinician expertise. The significance is substantial for several reasons: (1) It tackles a fundamental limitation of current RL approaches in healthcare - the difficulty of defining appropriate scalar reward functions; (2) The framework could significantly improve personalization of chronic disease management, an area affecting millions of patients globally; (3) By maintaining a Pareto front of policies, the approach enables adaptation to different patient priorities without requiring clinicians to specify numerical weights, enhancing clinical utility; (4) The emphasis on interpretability and transparency addresses a major barrier to AI adoption in healthcare; (5) The methodology has potential applications beyond chronic disease management to other healthcare domains with similar multi-objective characteristics. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and provides a convincing case for how the research could advance both the theoretical understanding of preference-based RL and its practical application in healthcare. The expected outcomes include not just algorithmic advances but also open-source tools that could facilitate broader adoption and impact."
