    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on preference-based learning in healthcare, specifically tackling the multi-objective nature of clinical decision-making. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, citing relevant papers like the Preference Transformer [1], fairness-aware PbRL [2], and multi-objective optimization approaches [7, 8]. The methodology clearly builds upon these works while addressing the challenges identified in the literature review, such as balancing multiple objectives, eliciting accurate preferences, and handling data scarcity. The only minor inconsistency is that while the task description mentions various application domains, the proposal focuses exclusively on healthcare, though this is consistent with the provided research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The three-component framework (preference elicitation, multi-objective RL optimization, and policy personalization) is logically organized and well-articulated. The experimental design includes clear metrics for evaluation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the Bayesian preference model with the Pareto front maintenance could be more explicitly defined, (2) the details of the meta-learner for policy personalization could be elaborated further, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'non-dominated sorting algorithm') are mentioned without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with the field."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to combining multi-objective optimization with preference-based reinforcement learning for healthcare applications. The integration of Bayesian preference modeling with Pareto front maintenance and personalized policy distribution is innovative and addresses a clear gap in the literature. The proposal extends beyond existing work by: (1) dynamically modeling clinician preferences rather than using static weights, (2) maintaining a Pareto front of policies representing different trade-offs, and (3) personalizing policies based on patient characteristics. While individual components (preference elicitation, multi-objective RL, personalization) have been explored separately in the literature, their integration into a cohesive framework specifically for healthcare decision support represents a novel contribution. The approach builds upon existing methods rather than introducing entirely new algorithms, which slightly limits its novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for preference modeling, multi-objective optimization, and policy personalization are well-defined and theoretically sound. The Bradley-Terry model for preference elicitation is appropriate, and the Bayesian approach to uncertainty quantification is well-justified. The extension of PPO to handle multiple objectives follows established principles in multi-objective RL. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) the proposal does not fully address potential challenges in preference elicitation, such as inconsistent or noisy clinician feedback, (2) the convergence properties of the proposed multi-objective PPO algorithm are not discussed, and (3) while the Gaussian process for policy personalization is mentioned, its exact formulation and training procedure could be more precisely defined."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The use of both real-world EHRs and simulated environments is practical, and the evaluation metrics are measurable. The proposed validation with 10 clinicians providing preference feedback is realistic. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) obtaining sufficient high-quality EHR data with appropriate annotations may be difficult, (2) recruiting clinicians for preference elicitation requires significant coordination and may face practical constraints, (3) the computational complexity of maintaining a Pareto front of policies could be substantial, especially for complex healthcare scenarios, and (4) the integration of multiple components (preference modeling, multi-objective optimization, personalization) introduces system complexity that may lead to implementation challenges. While these challenges are not insurmountable, they do require careful planning and may extend the timeline for implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in healthcare decision support: balancing multiple competing objectives while incorporating clinical expertise. The significance of this work is substantial for several reasons: (1) it offers a more intuitive approach for capturing clinician expertise compared to traditional reward engineering, (2) it enables personalized treatment recommendations that account for patient-specific factors, (3) it provides a framework for transparent decision-making through Pareto front visualization, and (4) it has potential applications beyond the specific use cases mentioned (diabetes, hypertension) to other chronic conditions requiring complex treatment decisions. The expected outcomes align well with current healthcare needs for more personalized, transparent, and effective decision support systems. The potential impact extends beyond technical contributions to practical clinical applications that could improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The proposal also addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as balancing multiple objectives and handling preference elicitation in healthcare contexts."
