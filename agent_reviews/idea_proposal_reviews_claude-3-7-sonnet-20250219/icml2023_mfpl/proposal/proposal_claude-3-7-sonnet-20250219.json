    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on preference-based learning in healthcare, specifically targeting the multi-objective nature of clinical decision-making. The methodology incorporates preference-based reinforcement learning techniques to capture clinician expertise while maintaining a Pareto front of policies representing different trade-offs between competing healthcare objectives. The proposal builds upon the literature review by addressing key challenges identified, such as balancing multiple objectives, eliciting accurate preferences, and ensuring interpretability. It cites relevant works like Kim et al. (2023) and Li & Guo (2024) that were mentioned in the literature review. The proposal's focus on medication dosing for chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension provides a concrete application area that aligns with the research idea's suggestion."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem formulation to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical aspects are explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the approach understandable to those familiar with reinforcement learning concepts. The multi-objective Markov Decision Process formulation is particularly well-defined, as is the preference-based learning of objective weights. The experimental design section provides a clear roadmap for implementation and evaluation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for incorporating patient preferences could be more detailed, (2) the computational complexity of maintaining and updating the Pareto front is not fully addressed, and (3) some technical terms might be challenging for readers without a strong background in reinforcement learning."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel integration of multi-objective optimization with preference-based reinforcement learning specifically tailored for healthcare applications. The approach of learning a distribution over objective weights rather than point estimates is innovative and addresses a gap in existing preference-based RL methods that typically assume a single underlying objective. The Bayesian approach to modeling uncertainty in clinician preferences is also a valuable contribution. However, while the individual components (multi-objective RL, preference-based learning, Pareto front optimization) are well-established in the literature, the novelty lies primarily in their integration and application to healthcare rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithms. The proposal builds incrementally on existing approaches like Convex Hull Value Iteration and the Bradley-Terry model rather than proposing entirely new methodological frameworks."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The mathematical formulation of the multi-objective MDP, preference modeling using the Bradley-Terry model, and Bayesian inference for learning weight distributions are all well-established and appropriate for the problem. The variational inference approach for approximating the posterior distribution is technically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate metrics for evaluation and comparison against relevant baselines. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes robustness analyses to address them. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from further theoretical justification: (1) the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm are not fully analyzed, (2) the theoretical guarantees for the Pareto-optimality of the computed policies are not explicitly stated, and (3) the impact of approximation errors in the variational inference on the final policy recommendations could be more thoroughly addressed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with a clear implementation plan. The methodology builds on established techniques in reinforcement learning and preference elicitation, and the experimental design outlines concrete steps for data collection, model training, and evaluation. The focus on specific medical conditions (diabetes and hypertension) provides a well-defined scope. However, several practical challenges may affect feasibility: (1) obtaining sufficient high-quality preference data from 20-30 clinical experts may be difficult and time-consuming, (2) accessing and preprocessing de-identified EHR data requires navigating complex privacy regulations and institutional approvals, (3) the computational complexity of maintaining a Pareto front of policies and performing Bayesian inference may be substantial, and (4) the proposal does not fully address how to handle the potential inconsistency in preferences across different clinicians. While these challenges don't render the approach infeasible, they may require significant resources and time to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in healthcare AI: developing decision support systems that can handle the inherently multi-objective nature of clinical decision-making while respecting both clinical expertise and patient preferences. If successful, this research could significantly impact how AI is applied in healthcare settings. The potential benefits include more personalized treatment recommendations, improved clinical decision support, reduced unwarranted variation in care, and enhanced interpretability of AI systems in healthcare. The approach also has broader implications for addressing fairness concerns in healthcare AI by explicitly modeling multiple objectives rather than collapsing them into a single reward function. The methodology is generalizable beyond the initial focus on medication dosing to other healthcare domains involving complex trade-offs. The proposal aligns with emerging regulatory requirements for interpretable and transparent AI in healthcare, increasing its potential for real-world adoption and impact."
