    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on scalable continual learning for foundation models by proposing a framework that combines knowledge graphs with parameter-efficient adapters. The proposal specifically tackles key workshop topics including avoiding retraining large models, addressing catastrophic forgetting, handling domain shifts and long-tailed distributions, and combining FMs with structured knowledge sources. The methodology builds upon the literature review, incorporating concepts from K-Adapter, Linked Adapters, and incremental LoRA approaches while extending them with dynamic knowledge graphs. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions the CLiMB benchmark from the literature review, it could have more explicitly connected to some of the evaluation protocols discussed in the literature review."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and conclusion. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formulations. The three main components (Dynamic Knowledge Graph, KG-Infused Adapters, and Sparse Retrieval Engine) are clearly defined, and the training protocol is logically presented. The experimental design includes specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for sparse retrieval during inference could be more detailed, (2) the process for identifying redundant or conflicting relations during graph consolidation needs more specificity, and (3) the relationship between the adapter architecture and the base foundation model architecture could be more explicitly defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong novelty by introducing several innovative elements. The integration of dynamic knowledge graphs with parameter-efficient adapters for continual learning represents a fresh approach not fully explored in the literature. The cross-attention mechanism for retrieving task-relevant knowledge from the KG during adaptation is particularly innovative. The periodic graph consolidation process to manage KG growth while preserving knowledge is also novel. While individual components like adapters and knowledge graphs have been explored separately (as seen in K-Adapter and incremental LoRA papers from the literature review), their combination into a unified framework for scalable continual learning, along with the sparse retrieval mechanism and the hybrid loss function incorporating KG alignment, represents a significant advancement beyond existing approaches. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work while building upon established foundations."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for cross-attention retrieval, hybrid training loss, and distillation loss are correctly presented and appropriate for the described tasks. The adapter architecture follows principles from existing literature while extending them with KG integration. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics for evaluation. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved: (1) the mechanism for initializing and updating KG embeddings could be more thoroughly explained, (2) the proposal mentions TransE for initializing KG embeddings but doesn't fully justify this choice over other KG embedding methods, (3) the exact formulation of the KG alignment loss (L_kg) is not provided, and (4) the proposal could benefit from a more detailed analysis of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach, particularly regarding the scalability of the KG as the number of tasks increases."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation details. The use of parameter-efficient adapters rather than full model fine-tuning reduces computational requirements, and the sparse retrieval mechanism addresses memory concerns. The experimental design specifies concrete datasets, metrics, and baselines. The implementation details mention using pre-trained Vision-Language FMs like CLIP, with specific adapter rank parameters. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) constructing and maintaining dynamic knowledge graphs at scale could be resource-intensive, especially for multimodal data, (2) the periodic graph consolidation process might introduce computational bottlenecks, (3) the proposal claims 40% reduction in training time and 30% reduction in memory use but doesn't provide sufficient justification for these specific numbers, and (4) the integration of the proposed system with existing foundation model architectures may require significant engineering effort. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present implementation hurdles that would need to be carefully addressed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in AI research: enabling foundation models to continuously adapt to new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting or prohibitive computational costs. If successful, this work could significantly impact how large models are maintained and updated in production environments. The approach has broad applicability across modalities (text, vision) and domains, with particular relevance to fields with evolving knowledge bases like healthcare and climate science. The proposal's focus on reducing computational requirements aligns with growing concerns about AI sustainability. The expected outcomes include substantial improvements in knowledge retention (15-20%) and computational efficiency (40% reduction in training time), which would represent meaningful advances in the field. The framework also contributes methodologically by providing a principled approach to integrating structured knowledge with neural adaptation. The significance is well-aligned with the workshop's focus on scalable continual learning for foundation models."
