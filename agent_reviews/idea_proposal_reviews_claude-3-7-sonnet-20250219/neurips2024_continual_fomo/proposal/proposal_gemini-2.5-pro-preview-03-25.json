        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on scalable continual learning for foundation models, particularly the challenges of catastrophic forgetting, domain shifts, and long-tailed distributions. The DKG-Adapter framework incorporates structured knowledge sources (knowledge graphs) as highlighted in the workshop topics. The proposal builds upon the literature review by extending concepts from K-Adapter (knowledge infusion), Linked Adapters (inter-adapter knowledge transfer), I2I (adapter initialization), and incremental KG embedding techniques. The methodology is comprehensive and addresses all aspects mentioned in the original research idea, including the dynamic KG component, cross-attention mechanism, sparse retrieval, and graph consolidation strategies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical notation and algorithmic descriptions. The DKG-Adapter architecture, KG update process, and continual learning algorithm are all thoroughly described. The experimental design, including baselines and evaluation metrics, is well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for initializing new adapters could be more explicitly connected to existing methods like I2I, (2) the relationship between task-specific adapters and the global KG could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical details about the KG embedding update process could be more precisely defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of dynamic knowledge graphs with adapter-based continual learning for foundation models. While it builds upon existing concepts (adapters, knowledge-infused models, and continual KG embedding), the combination and implementation approach is innovative. Specifically, the dynamic KG component that evolves with new tasks, the cross-attention mechanism for selective knowledge integration, the sparse retrieval strategy, and the graph consolidation process collectively form a novel framework. The approach differs from K-Adapter by making the knowledge source dynamic rather than static, from Linked Adapters by incorporating structured external knowledge rather than just inter-adapter connections, and from incremental KG embedding work by focusing on the application to foundation model adaptation rather than just KG representation learning."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-grounded in established methods and literature. The technical formulations for the cross-attention mechanism, adapter architecture, and evaluation metrics are correct and follow standard practices. The continual learning algorithm is logically structured and addresses the key challenges of catastrophic forgetting and efficient knowledge transfer. However, there are some areas that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the theoretical guarantees for forgetting mitigation are not explicitly provided, (2) the potential interference between the KG update process and adapter learning could be more thoroughly analyzed, and (3) the computational complexity analysis of the sparse retrieval mechanism could be more rigorous. Additionally, while the approach to KG consolidation is reasonable, more formal criteria for redundancy detection and merging could strengthen the theoretical foundation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined components that can be implemented using existing technologies and frameworks. The use of adapters significantly reduces computational requirements compared to full fine-tuning, and the sparse retrieval mechanism addresses potential scalability issues with the growing KG. However, there are several implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) the quality and coverage of automatically extracted entities and relations for KG construction may vary across domains, (2) the efficiency of the sparse retrieval mechanism for very large KGs needs careful optimization, (3) the computational overhead of cross-attention between adapter states and KG facts during training could be significant, and (4) the graph consolidation process may be computationally expensive for large KGs. While these challenges are acknowledged and strategies are proposed to address them, they represent non-trivial engineering efforts that could impact the practical implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in the field of foundation models: enabling efficient continual learning without catastrophic forgetting or excessive computational costs. If successful, the DKG-Adapter framework could significantly impact how large models are updated and maintained over time, reducing the need for costly retraining cycles. The integration of dynamic structured knowledge with implicit model knowledge represents an important step toward more robust, adaptable AI systems. The approach is broadly applicable across different modalities (language, vision, multimodal) and foundation model architectures, increasing its potential impact. The focus on computational efficiency and scalability directly addresses a pressing need in the field. The proposal could lead to both theoretical advances in understanding knowledge integration for continual learning and practical applications in domains requiring up-to-date knowledge and adaptation."
