    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on scalable continual learning for foundation models. It directly addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in FMs when fine-tuned on smaller datasets, which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposal integrates structured knowledge sources (knowledge graphs) to help CL, which is another specific topic of interest. The idea also considers computational efficiency (<5% additional compute) addressing the scalability concerns highlighted in the task description. The only minor limitation in alignment is that while the proposal mentions benchmarks for evaluation, it doesn't fully elaborate on designing new evaluation protocols as mentioned in one of the workshop topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a well-defined problem (catastrophic forgetting in FMs), a specific approach (knowledge-anchored parameter isolation), and expected outcomes (30-50% reduction in forgetting with <5% additional compute). The mechanism of using a knowledge graph to identify critical parameters is clearly explained, as is the process of incremental KG expansion. The concept of task-specific metadata for handling domain shifts is also well-articulated. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific algorithm for determining which parameters are 'knowledge-anchored' and the exact mechanism for KG-FM alignment measurement."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to continual learning for foundation models. The integration of dynamic knowledge graphs with parameter isolation represents a fresh combination of techniques not commonly seen in current CL literature. The concept of 'knowledge-anchored' parameters guided by external knowledge structures is particularly innovative. While parameter isolation and knowledge graphs have been explored separately in ML research, their combination for selective parameter freezing in foundation models appears to be a novel contribution. The approach of using KG nodes to encode task-specific metadata for routing inputs to relevant sub-networks also adds originality. The idea builds upon existing concepts (adapters, soft prompts) but combines them in innovative ways."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The use of adapters and parameter isolation techniques has been demonstrated in prior work, making that aspect practical. Knowledge graphs are well-established tools that could be integrated with foundation models. However, several aspects require careful consideration: (1) maintaining alignment between the KG and the FM's latent space at scale could be computationally intensive; (2) determining which parameters are truly 'knowledge-anchored' may require extensive analysis; (3) the promised <5% additional compute seems optimistic given the overhead of maintaining and querying a dynamic KG. The 30-50% reduction in forgetting is an ambitious target that would require rigorous experimental validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in the field of foundation models - catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning - which is a major barrier to their practical deployment and continuous improvement. If successful, the approach could enable foundation models to be continuously updated without expensive retraining, significantly reducing computational costs and environmental impact. The potential applications mentioned (personalized AI assistants and domain-adaptive medical models) represent high-impact use cases where continual learning is essential. The work could bridge the gap between static foundation models and dynamic real-world information, which is a fundamental limitation identified in the workshop description. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's focus on efficiency and scalability, which are pressing concerns in the field."
