    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on memory, long-range context, and architectural improvements for sequence models. The proposed ADM-SSM architecture implements the core concept from the research idea of combining state space models with an external, differentiable dual-memory system. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing and building upon works like Mamba, SMR, and LMNs while addressing the identified key challenges of memory retention, computational efficiency, and adaptive memory management. The methodology section provides comprehensive technical details that align perfectly with the proposed approach, including the dual-memory architecture, memory controllers, and RL-based optimization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical flow with appropriate technical detail. The architecture is explained thoroughly with mathematical formulations and a helpful algorithmic summary. The dual-memory system (working memory and long-term memory) and the controllers' functions are well-defined. The experimental design section clearly outlines baselines, ablation studies, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism of the 'Compress' function for LTM storage could be more precisely defined, (2) some parameters like δ and ε are introduced without full explanation of how they would be determined, and (3) the interaction between the RL objective and the main task loss could be more explicitly formulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly novel approach to extreme-length sequence modeling. The integration of a dual-memory architecture with SSMs and the use of RL-trained controllers for memory management represents a significant innovation beyond existing approaches. While individual components like SSMs, external memory, and RL for optimization have been explored separately, their combination into this adaptive dual-memory framework with importance-based memory management is original. The proposal clearly differentiates itself from prior work like SMR (which lacks explicit long-term retrieval), Mamba (which lacks external memory), and LMNs (which use rigid hierarchies). The RL-driven approach to optimize memory decisions directly tied to downstream performance is particularly innovative. The proposal doesn't completely reinvent sequence modeling but rather introduces a thoughtful new paradigm that builds intelligently on existing foundations."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with a solid theoretical framework. The mathematical formulations for the SSM dynamics, memory operations, and retrieval mechanisms are technically correct and build on established methods. The RL formulation for memory management is appropriate and well-justified. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the stability of the RL training process for memory controllers might face challenges that aren't fully addressed, (2) the proposal doesn't thoroughly analyze potential failure modes or edge cases in the memory management system, (3) there's limited discussion of how the model would handle distribution shifts between training and inference, and (4) the theoretical analysis of memory capacity and information retention could be more rigorous. While the approach is generally well-founded, these gaps slightly reduce its soundness score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach but with several implementation challenges. On the positive side, it builds on established SSM architectures and uses well-understood RL techniques. The pseudocode provides a clear implementation path, and the experimental design is comprehensive. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) training the RL controllers alongside the main model introduces significant complexity and potential instability, (2) the computational overhead of maintaining and querying dual memory stores might offset efficiency gains, especially at extreme lengths, (3) the proposal requires extensive experimentation with hyperparameters like memory sizes K and L, thresholds δ and ε, and RL reward formulations, (4) scaling to 1M tokens as proposed would require substantial computational resources, and (5) the integration of compression mechanisms for LTM adds another layer of complexity. While the approach is implementable, these challenges make it moderately difficult to execute successfully without significant engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical limitation in current sequence modeling architectures - the ability to effectively model and retrieve information from extremely long contexts. If successful, this work would have substantial impact on multiple domains including document-level understanding, code reasoning, scientific literature synthesis, and genome analysis. The expected outcomes of 10-20% lower perplexity on long-context tasks and doubled retrieval accuracy would represent meaningful advances. The proposal's significance extends beyond performance metrics to introducing a new paradigm for sequence modeling that could influence future architectural designs. The principled approach to dynamic memory allocation based on importance rather than recency could be particularly influential. The work also bridges theoretical understanding of memory in neural networks with practical implementations. While not completely transformative of the field, this research would make a significant contribution to advancing sequence modeling capabilities for extreme-length contexts."
