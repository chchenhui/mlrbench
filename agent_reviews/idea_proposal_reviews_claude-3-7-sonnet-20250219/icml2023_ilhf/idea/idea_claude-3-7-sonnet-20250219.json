    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description. It directly addresses the challenge of learning from implicit human feedback signals (specifically facial expressions) during interaction, which is a core topic mentioned in the task. The proposal tackles how to ground initially unknown feedback signals, deals with the non-stationarity of human feedback through its adaptive interpretation component, and addresses personalization versus general learning. The three-stage approach specifically targets interaction-grounded learning from arbitrary feedback signals, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest in the task description. The only minor gap is that it doesn't extensively address some of the broader HCI design methods or accessibility concerns mentioned in the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates a three-stage approach with specific components: unsupervised representation learning, correlation mechanisms for inferring rewards, and adaptive interpretation. The motivation is well-explained, and the evaluation plan is outlined with concrete scenarios (virtual assistant tasks and robotic learning). The only minor ambiguities are in the details of how exactly the correlation mechanism will work to infer reward signals from facial expressions, and how the system will handle potential misinterpretations during the learning process. These implementation details would benefit from further elaboration, but the overall concept is well-articulated and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to interactive reinforcement learning. While facial expression recognition itself is not new, and some work exists on using human feedback in RL, the proposed unsupervised approach to learning the meaning of expressions without pre-labeled data is innovative. The three-stage framework that builds personalized models of user feedback styles represents a fresh perspective on the problem. However, it builds upon existing work in both facial expression recognition and interactive RL rather than introducing a completely revolutionary paradigm. The novelty lies in the integration and the specific approach to grounding initially unknown feedback signals, which addresses a gap in current interactive learning systems."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Facial expression recognition technology exists, as do reinforcement learning frameworks, making the basic components available. However, the unsupervised clustering of facial expressions into meaningful patterns that correlate with rewards presents significant technical challenges. Facial expressions are highly variable across individuals and contexts, making consistent interpretation difficult. The adaptive interpretation component that continuously refines meaning would require sophisticated algorithms to handle ambiguity and inconsistency in human expressions. Additionally, real-time processing of facial data while simultaneously running RL algorithms may present computational challenges. These hurdles are not insurmountable but would require considerable effort and expertise to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant gap in current interactive learning systems. If successful, it could substantially reduce the feedback burden on users by leveraging naturally occurring facial expressions instead of requiring explicit feedback. This has broad implications for human-machine interaction across numerous domains including virtual assistants, educational technology, healthcare robots, and accessibility tools. The potential to create more intuitive and natural interaction paradigms could significantly advance the field of interactive learning. The approach also tackles the fundamental challenge of grounding initially unknown feedback signals, which has theoretical importance beyond just facial expressions. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on only one modality of implicit feedback (facial expressions) when multimodal approaches might ultimately be more robust."
