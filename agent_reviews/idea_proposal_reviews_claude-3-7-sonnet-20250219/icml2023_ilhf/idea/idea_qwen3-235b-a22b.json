    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the core challenge of learning from implicit human feedback signals (gestures, language, etc.) without explicit labels, which is central to the workshop's focus. The proposal specifically tackles interaction-grounded learning, non-stationarity in human preferences, and leveraging multimodal cues - all explicitly mentioned in the task description. The cross-modal self-supervised approach directly responds to the question of 'when is it possible to go beyond reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards.' The only minor gap is that it doesn't extensively address the HCI design methods or accessibility aspects mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a three-step framework: (1) modeling policy and feedback as multivariate time-series with mutual information maximization, (2) training a reward function via contrastive learning, and (3) integrating this into RL. The motivation and approach are well-defined, with specific techniques (mutual information maximization, contrastive learning) clearly identified. The application domain (collaborative robotics) is specified. However, some technical details could be further elaborated - for instance, exactly how the mutual information maximization would be implemented, or how the system would handle completely novel feedback signals. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to grounding implicit feedback signals through cross-modal consistency and sequential structure. The combination of mutual information maximization with contrastive learning to infer implicit rewards without explicit labels represents an innovative approach to the problem. While individual components (contrastive learning, mutual information maximization) exist in the literature, their integration for interaction-grounded learning with implicit feedback appears fresh. The approach of treating multimodal signals as time-series data to be aligned is particularly innovative. It's not entirely revolutionary as it builds upon existing self-supervised and contrastive learning techniques, but it applies them in a novel way to an important problem space."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The proposed techniques (mutual information maximization, contrastive learning, reinforcement learning) are well-established, and the integration seems technically viable. Testing in simulated environments provides a practical starting point. However, there are implementation challenges: (1) capturing and processing multimodal human feedback in real-time requires sophisticated sensing and computing infrastructure, (2) aligning sequential patterns across modalities with different temporal characteristics is non-trivial, and (3) the approach may require large amounts of interaction data to learn meaningful representations. The proposal acknowledges testing in simulated environments first, which is a prudent approach given these challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in human-AI interaction: enabling systems to learn from natural, implicit human feedback without requiring explicit reward engineering. The significance is high because: (1) it could dramatically reduce the cost and expertise required to train interactive systems, (2) it would enable more natural and intuitive human-AI interactions across numerous applications, (3) it addresses the fundamental challenge of non-stationary human preferences, and (4) it could bridge important gaps between reinforcement learning and human-computer interaction. The potential impact extends across robotics, assistive technologies, personalized systems, and any domain requiring adaptive human-AI collaboration. The approach could fundamentally change how we design interactive learning systems."
