    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on interactive learning with implicit human feedback, particularly the questions about learning from natural/implicit signals, handling non-stationarity, and designing intrinsic reward systems for social alignment. The SAILOR framework builds upon the literature review, citing and extending work from Abramson et al. (2022), Lee et al. (2021), and Xu et al. (2020). The methodology incorporates multimodal feedback encoding, intrinsic reward inference, and meta-reinforcement learning as outlined in the original idea. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions challenges with data efficiency, the proposal doesn't explicitly address how it will overcome this challenge beyond using pre-training and meta-learning approaches."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The SAILOR framework is explained in detail, with specific algorithmic steps and mathematical formulations that make the approach concrete and implementable. The research design, data collection methods, and experimental setup are thoroughly described. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for bootstrapping the initial reward model when no ground truth is available, (2) more details on how the meta-learning approach will be evaluated specifically for adaptation to non-stationary preferences, and (3) clearer distinction between simulation experiments and human-subject studies in the evaluation section. Despite these minor issues, the overall clarity is strong, making the research plan easy to follow and understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The SAILOR framework presents a novel integration of several cutting-edge approaches in a way that addresses an important gap in the literature. While individual components (multimodal encoding, IRL, meta-learning) have been explored separately, their combination for learning intrinsic rewards from implicit feedback without predefined semantics is innovative. The proposal extends beyond existing work like RLHF (which typically uses explicit feedback) and single-modality approaches (like the EEG-based feedback in Xu et al.). The meta-learning component for adaptation to non-stationary preferences is particularly novel in this context. The proposal doesn't claim to introduce fundamentally new algorithms but rather a novel framework that combines and adapts existing techniques in a meaningful way to solve an important problem. The approach of learning to interpret multimodal implicit feedback signals online without prior knowledge of their meaning represents a significant advancement over current methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations in reinforcement learning, multimodal learning, and human-computer interaction. The mathematical formulations for the transformer-based encoder, contrastive preference learning, and meta-learning components are technically correct and appropriate for the task. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are some potential weaknesses: (1) the assumption that implicit feedback signals contain sufficient information to infer rewards may not always hold, especially in ambiguous situations; (2) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address the challenge of noisy multimodal data in real-time processing; (3) while the meta-learning approach is well-motivated, its convergence properties in this specific context aren't thoroughly analyzed; and (4) the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential failure modes and mitigation strategies. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is methodologically rigorous and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a technically ambitious project with several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the research plan is detailed and broken down into manageable components, and the initial use of simulated environments before human studies is a practical approach. The technical requirements (transformer models, RL algorithms) are within reach of current technology. However, several factors reduce feasibility: (1) collecting and processing multimodal data (facial expressions, speech prosody, gaze) in real-time requires sophisticated sensing infrastructure and processing pipelines; (2) the meta-learning component adds significant computational complexity; (3) human-subject experiments with sufficient diversity to test adaptation capabilities will be resource-intensive; (4) the proposal acknowledges the inherent ambiguity of implicit signals, which may lead to unstable learning; and (5) the timeline for implementing and evaluating all components of SAILOR is likely to be lengthy. While the individual components are feasible, their integration into a cohesive, real-time system that works robustly with human participants presents significant challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in interactive learning systems: enabling agents to learn from natural human feedback without requiring explicit, structured input. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus and has far-reaching implications for human-AI interaction. If successful, SAILOR would represent a significant advancement in creating more intuitive, adaptive, and user-friendly AI systems. The potential applications in personalized education, assistive robotics, collaborative AI, and accessibility tools are compelling and socially valuable. The research would contribute theoretical insights into implicit communication and practical methods for grounding meaning in interaction. By reducing the need for hand-crafted rewards or explicit feedback mechanisms, it could democratize AI development and deployment. The proposal also addresses the critical challenge of adaptation to non-stationary preferences and environments, which is essential for real-world deployment. Overall, the potential impact on both scientific understanding and practical applications is substantial."
