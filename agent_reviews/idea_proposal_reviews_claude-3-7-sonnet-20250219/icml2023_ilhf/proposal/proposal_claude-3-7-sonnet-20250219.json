    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of learning from implicit human feedback in interactive settings, which is central to the task description. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including multimodal feedback interpretation, intrinsic reward learning, and meta-learning for adaptation to non-stationary preferences. It builds upon the literature review by acknowledging existing work (e.g., Abramson et al., Lee et al., Xu et al.) while identifying and addressing gaps in current approaches. The proposal specifically tackles the topics mentioned in the task description, such as interaction-grounded learning from arbitrary feedback signals, learning from natural/implicit human feedback, accounting for non-stationarity, and designing intrinsic reward systems for social alignment. The methodology is comprehensive and addresses the minimal assumptions question raised in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations and clear descriptions of each component. The multimodal data collection, representation learning, reward inference, and meta-learning components are all well-defined with specific implementation details. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are thoroughly outlined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific tasks that will be used in the interactive environment could be more concretely defined, (2) some technical details about how the uncertainty-aware reward model will be implemented in practice could be elaborated, and (3) the proposal could more explicitly discuss how the approach handles the 'initially unknown' aspect of feedback signals mentioned in the task description."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to learning from implicit multimodal feedback that goes beyond existing methods in several ways. The integration of contrastive learning for multimodal representation, maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning for reward inference, and meta-learning for adaptation creates a comprehensive framework that hasn't been fully explored in the literature. The uncertainty-aware reward model is particularly innovative, addressing the ambiguity inherent in implicit feedback. The proposal distinguishes itself from prior work by focusing on learning intrinsic reward functions without predefined semantics, whereas most existing approaches (as noted in the literature review) rely on more structured feedback or single modalities. The combination of supervised and unsupervised contrastive learning objectives is also novel in this context. While individual components build on existing techniques, their integration and application to the problem of implicit multimodal feedback learning represents a significant advancement over current approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The contrastive learning approach for representation learning is well-justified and mathematically formulated. The maximum entropy IRL framework is appropriate for inferring rewards from implicit feedback, and the meta-learning approach addresses the non-stationarity challenge highlighted in the task description. The technical formulations are mostly correct and clearly presented. However, there are some areas where the soundness could be improved: (1) the adversarial training procedure for MaxEnt IRL is described somewhat vaguely and could benefit from more rigorous formulation, (2) the proposal doesn't fully address potential issues of identifiability in the reward inference process (i.e., how to ensure that the inferred rewards actually correspond to human intent), and (3) while uncertainty estimation is mentioned, the specific Bayesian or ensemble methods to be used aren't detailed. Additionally, the proposal could more thoroughly discuss potential failure modes and how they would be addressed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach but faces several implementation challenges. The data collection plan is realistic, with a clear protocol for gathering multimodal interaction data from 50-100 participants. The technical components (multimodal encoders, contrastive learning, IRL, meta-learning) are all implementable with current technology. However, there are significant feasibility concerns: (1) collecting high-quality multimodal data with accurate annotations is resource-intensive and challenging, (2) training the complex model architecture with multiple components may require substantial computational resources, (3) the online adaptation process might face latency issues in real-time interactions, and (4) the proposal doesn't fully address how to handle missing or noisy modalities in real-world settings. Additionally, while the evaluation plan is comprehensive, conducting user studies with sufficient statistical power across diverse demographics will be time-consuming. The timeline for implementation is not specified, which raises questions about the practical execution of this ambitious project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in interactive learning systems with potentially transformative impact. Learning from implicit multimodal feedback without predefined semantics would significantly advance human-AI interaction across numerous domains. The approach directly tackles one of the most challenging problems in interactive machine learning: creating agents that can learn from natural human feedback rather than requiring humans to adapt to AI limitations. The expected outcomes align perfectly with the workshop's goals, offering solutions to fundamental questions about interaction-grounded learning from arbitrary feedback signals. The potential applications in education, healthcare, assistive robotics, and human-robot collaboration are compelling and could lead to more accessible, personalized, and socially aligned AI systems. The proposal also contributes to ethical AI development by creating systems that better respect human values and intentions. The multimodal dataset and benchmarks would be valuable resources for the broader research community, extending the impact beyond the immediate research outcomes."
