    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of learning from implicit human feedback in interactive settings, which is central to the task description. The proposal incorporates multimodal signals (facial expressions, speech tone, EEG, eye movements) as specified in both the task and idea. The methodology follows the outlined approach in the research idea, using transformer-based models to encode multimodal signals and contrastive learning for reward inference. The proposal also addresses non-stationarity through meta-learning as mentioned in the task description and research idea. The literature review is well-integrated, with references to PEBBLE for preference relabeling and EEG-based feedback approaches. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions imitation learning approaches, the proposal focuses more on reinforcement learning paradigms."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and conclusion. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design, including baselines and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly explained. The proposal uses concrete examples (e.g., a healthcare assistant adapting to patient's pain levels) to illustrate applications. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for how the contrastive loss identifies implicit preferences without explicit labels could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the meta-learning approach and the contrastive learning framework could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical details about how the multimodal transformer handles temporal alignment across different modalities are not fully specified."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents significant novelty in several aspects. The integration of multimodal implicit feedback (facial expressions, EEG, eye tracking) for intrinsic reward learning extends beyond current approaches that rely primarily on explicit feedback. The combination of contrastive learning for reward inference with meta-learning for adaptation to non-stationary preferences represents a novel technical approach. The proposal distinguishes itself from prior work like PEBBLE by focusing on truly implicit signals rather than preference relabeling, and from EEG-based approaches by incorporating multiple modalities. The application of these techniques to interactive question-answering with real-time adaptation is also innovative. While individual components (contrastive learning, meta-learning, multimodal transformers) exist in the literature, their integration for socially-aligned intrinsic reward learning represents a fresh perspective that addresses gaps in current interactive learning systems."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for the multimodal transformer encoder and contrastive learning approach are technically correct. The use of PPO for policy optimization is appropriate given the reinforcement learning context. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the contrastive loss formulation doesn't fully explain how trajectory pairs are selected without explicit preference labels, (2) the proposal doesn't address potential challenges in aligning different modalities with varying sampling rates and temporal dynamics, (3) while meta-learning is proposed for adaptation, the specific algorithm (e.g., MAML, Reptile) isn't specified, and (4) the statistical validity of the proposed evaluation metrics could be more thoroughly justified, particularly for the correlation between predicted rewards and human frustration scores."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents moderate feasibility challenges. The data collection plan to gather 50,000 interactions across 200 participants is ambitious and resource-intensive, requiring significant time and coordination. The multimodal nature of the data (including EEG) adds complexity to the collection process and may introduce practical challenges in real-world settings. The computational requirements for training a multimodal transformer with meta-learning components are substantial. The proposal acknowledges some implementation challenges but doesn't fully address how to handle missing modalities or sensor failures in real-world deployments. The timeline for completing such extensive data collection, model development, and evaluation is not specified, raising questions about practical implementation. While the core components are technically feasible, the integration of all elements (multimodal sensing, contrastive learning, meta-learning, and policy optimization) presents significant engineering challenges that may require simplification or phased implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in interactive learning systems by enabling agents to learn from implicit, multimodal human feedback without relying on hand-crafted rewards. This has transformative potential across multiple domains: (1) In assistive robotics, it could enable more natural and adaptive human-robot interaction; (2) In education, it could lead to personalized tutoring systems that respond to subtle cues of confusion or engagement; (3) In accessibility, it could create interfaces that adapt to users with diverse abilities. The reduction in labeling burden is particularly significant for deploying AI systems in resource-constrained environments. The proposed benchmark dataset would be valuable to the broader research community. The interdisciplinary nature of the work bridges machine learning, HCI, cognitive science, and robotics, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals. The ethical considerations regarding data privacy and bias mitigation further enhance the proposal's significance by addressing important societal concerns."
