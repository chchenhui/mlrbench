    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key subject areas mentioned in the task, including causal representation learning, perturbation biology, active learning in genomics, multimodal representation learning, uncertainty quantification, and experimental design for biology. The proposal's focus on using machine learning to understand biological mechanisms for drug discovery perfectly matches the workshop's primary objective of bridging the gap between machine learning and genomics for target identification. The integration of multi-omics data and the emphasis on interpretable models also align with the task's interest in single-cell RNA analysis, bulk RNA studies, and proteomics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates a three-part framework: (1) learning latent causal representations from multimodal data, (2) identifying causal relationships via interventional data, and (3) optimizing experimental design using active learning. The expected outcomes and potential impact are well-defined. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific implementation of the structured variational autoencoders and how counterfactual reasoning will be applied. The connection between the different components of the framework could also be more explicitly described to enhance clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to combining causal graphical models with active learning for genomics. While causal discovery and active learning are established fields individually, their integration for iterative design of perturbation experiments in multi-omics data represents an innovative approach. The use of structured variational autoencoders for learning latent causal representations from multimodal omics data is particularly novel. The feedback loop between computational predictions and experimental validation also represents a fresh perspective. However, some components build upon existing methods in causal inference and active learning, which slightly reduces the novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents some implementation challenges. The availability of perturbation datasets like LINCS and CRISPR screens provides a solid foundation for validation. The individual components (causal modeling, active learning, variational autoencoders) have established methodologies. However, integrating these components into a cohesive framework that works effectively across different omics modalities will require significant technical expertise. The computational complexity of learning causal graphs at genomic scale could be challenging. Additionally, the validation of causal discoveries might require new experimental data beyond what's publicly available, potentially increasing resource requirements. Overall, the idea is implementable but will require careful planning and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research idea is very high. Understanding causal relationships in genomics is a fundamental challenge in drug discovery, and the proposed approach directly addresses this critical need. If successful, this framework could substantially improve target identification, reducing the high failure rate in clinical trials by prioritizing interventions with high causal confidence. The integration of uncertainty quantification and experimental feedback loops could transform how drug development is conducted, making it more hypothesis-driven and less reliant on trial-and-error. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in pharmaceutical research, potentially accelerating the development of new therapies for various diseases."
