        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging machine learning and genomics for drug discovery by developing a framework that combines causal graphical models with active learning for perturbation experiment design. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the original idea, including multi-omics data integration, causal representation learning, counterfactual reasoning, and active learning for experimental design. It thoroughly addresses the five key challenges identified in the literature review: high dimensionality, multimodal data integration, interpretability, efficient experimental design, and uncertainty quantification. The proposal also cites and builds upon the relevant literature mentioned in the review, such as Sun et al. (2024), Tejada-Lapuerta et al. (2023), Wu et al. (2024), Lopez et al. (2022), and others. The methodology section clearly outlines how these challenges will be tackled through the proposed framework."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and well-defined. The methodology section provides a detailed algorithmic framework with clear steps and mathematical formulations. The proposal effectively communicates complex concepts like causal representation learning, active learning, and uncertainty quantification in an accessible manner. The experimental design and validation approach is thoroughly described with appropriate metrics and baselines. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mathematical formulation of how interventions are incorporated into the SVAE could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the latent representations and the causal graph structure could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the active learning strategy (e.g., computational approximations for the acquisition function) could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several advanced approaches into a cohesive framework. The combination of structured variational autoencoders for multi-omics causal representation learning with intervention-aware causal discovery and active learning for perturbation selection represents a novel synthesis not fully explored in the literature. The proposal extends existing work (e.g., Lopez et al. 2022, Sun et al. 2024) by explicitly incorporating interventional data into the representation learning process and developing an active learning loop for experimental design. However, while the integration is innovative, many of the individual components build directly on existing methods rather than proposing fundamentally new algorithms. The proposal acknowledges this by citing relevant prior work and positioning itself as an extension and integration of these approaches. The novelty lies more in the synergistic combination and application to the specific problem domain rather than in developing entirely new theoretical foundations."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The theoretical foundations in causal inference, representation learning, and active learning are solid and appropriately referenced. The structured VAE approach for causal representation learning is well-motivated and builds on established principles. The causal discovery methods incorporate both observational and interventional data, which is theoretically sound for causal inference. The uncertainty quantification approaches (Bayesian methods and bootstrapping) are appropriate for the task. The experimental design is comprehensive, with suitable metrics for evaluation on both synthetic and real-world data. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges like latent confounding and proposes reasonable approaches to address them. The mathematical formulations are generally correct, though some details about identifiability conditions for the causal representation learning could be more thoroughly addressed. The validation strategy is rigorous, comparing against appropriate baselines and using multiple evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, though with some implementation challenges. The data sources identified (LINCS L1000, DepMap/Achilles, Perturb-seq) are publicly available and appropriate for the research questions. The methodological components (VAEs, causal discovery algorithms, active learning) have established implementations that can be adapted. The evaluation metrics and experimental design are practical and achievable. However, several aspects present feasibility challenges: (1) The computational complexity of learning causal graphs in high dimensions may require significant optimization or approximation techniques not fully detailed in the proposal; (2) The active learning component requires either real experimental validation (which would be resource-intensive) or realistic simulation of biological perturbations (which is challenging to model accurately); (3) The integration of multiple omics modalities with potentially different scales, noise characteristics, and missing data patterns will require sophisticated preprocessing and alignment techniques; (4) The Bayesian uncertainty quantification over graph structures may be computationally intensive for large networks. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they will require careful implementation strategies and possibly some scope adjustments during execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in drug discovery and genomics with potentially high impact. The problem of identifying causal drivers of disease for drug target selection is of paramount importance, as highlighted in the task description. The proposed framework could significantly accelerate the early stages of drug discovery by providing more reliable causal insights, potentially reducing the high failure rates in clinical trials. The active learning component addresses the resource-intensive nature of perturbation experiments, offering a more efficient approach to experimental design that could save substantial time and costs. The interpretable causal models would provide biologists with valuable tools to understand disease mechanisms beyond mere correlations. The methodology advances machine learning for genomics in multiple areas (causal inference, multimodal learning, active learning, uncertainty quantification) aligned with the workshop's goals. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and connects them to real-world applications in drug development. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's interdisciplinary nature, bridging machine learning and biology in a way that could foster valuable collaborations."
