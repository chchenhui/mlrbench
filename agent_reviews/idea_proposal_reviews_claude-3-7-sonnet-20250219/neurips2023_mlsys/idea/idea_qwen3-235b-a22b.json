        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on ML for systems, specifically targeting carbon-aware job scheduling in distributed datacenters, which is explicitly mentioned as a desired topic in the task description ('Applying ML for compute sustainability, including power/energy/carbon optimization. Examples include energy-aware job scheduling...'). The proposal uses reinforcement learning, which is highlighted in the task description as a key approach. The idea also addresses the workshop's goal of establishing best practices and methods in ML for Systems, and contributes to the unification of benchmarks through its proposed simulation environment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (carbon emissions from datacenters), the proposed solution (hierarchical reinforcement learning framework), the specific components (high-level and low-level policies), and expected outcomes (30-40% carbon reduction with 10-15% performance trade-off). The hierarchical structure of the RL framework is well-defined, with distinct roles for different levels of policies. The only minor ambiguities are in the details of how transfer learning would be implemented and how the simulation environment would be structured, which would likely be elaborated in a full paper."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in several aspects. The hierarchical approach to RL for datacenter scheduling that jointly considers carbon intensity, energy prices, and workload urgency is innovative. The integration of transfer learning to adapt policies to new datacenters without retraining is also a fresh perspective. However, both RL for job scheduling and carbon-aware computing have been explored before, though perhaps not in this specific hierarchical combination. The proposal builds upon existing concepts in RL and green computing rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or paradigms, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to various scheduling problems, and the hierarchical approach is well-established in RL literature. The proposal to create a simulation environment is practical and addresses the need for reproducibility. However, there are moderate challenges: (1) obtaining realistic carbon intensity and workload data across diverse geographic locations may be difficult, (2) balancing the multiple objectives (carbon, performance, cost) in a stable RL framework requires careful design, and (3) ensuring that transfer learning works effectively across heterogeneous datacenters will require significant engineering effort. These challenges are surmountable but non-trivial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is very high. Datacenters accounting for ~2% of global COâ‚‚ emissions represents a substantial environmental impact, and the continued growth of AI workloads (especially LLMs mentioned in both the proposal and task description) will only increase this footprint. The potential 30-40% reduction in carbon emissions while maintaining reasonable performance is impactful. The open-source simulation environment would address a critical gap in reproducibility and benchmarking in this domain. The work bridges ML and systems research, directly addressing the interdisciplinary goals of the workshop. The significance is further enhanced by the timeliness of the topic, as sustainability in computing is becoming increasingly important to industry, academia, and policymakers."
