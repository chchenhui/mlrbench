    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on ML for systems, particularly in the area of 'applying ML for compute sustainability, including power/energy/carbon optimization' through energy-aware job scheduling. The proposal builds upon the literature review by acknowledging existing work (CarbonClipper, PCAPS, CarbonScaler) while proposing a novel reinforcement learning approach that addresses limitations in current heuristic-based methods. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are all consistent with the initial idea of using DRL for energy-carbon-aware scheduling. The proposal maintains fidelity to all key aspects mentioned in the original idea, including the state representation, action space, and reward signal structure."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined, and the technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations for the state vector, reward function, and learning algorithm. The experimental design, including baselines and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly described. The only minor areas that could benefit from additional clarity are: (1) more specific details on how the simulator will model energy-carbon dynamics, and (2) further elaboration on the implementation details of the Kubernetes integration. Overall, the proposal is easy to follow and presents a comprehensive plan that would be understandable to both ML and systems researchers."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining deep reinforcement learning with energy and carbon-aware scheduling in a way that hasn't been fully explored in the literature. While carbon-aware scheduling (CarbonClipper, PCAPS) and RL for systems optimization exist separately, GreenSched innovates by integrating real-time energy costs, carbon intensity, and SLA constraints into a unified DRL framework. The action space that includes job assignment, power capping, VM migration, and delay scheduling is more comprehensive than existing approaches. However, the proposal builds incrementally on existing methods rather than introducing a completely revolutionary approach. The use of PPO for scheduling is not entirely new, though its application to this specific problem domain with the proposed state and action representations does offer fresh perspectives."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established reinforcement learning techniques (PPO with actor-critic architecture), and the mathematical formulations for the state representation, reward function, and learning objective are correctly presented. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines from the literature and relevant metrics for evaluation. The training approach, using a simulator followed by fine-tuning in a real environment, follows sound ML practices. The proposal also acknowledges the trade-offs between energy/carbon reduction and performance through the weighted reward function. The only minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions generalized advantage estimation (GAE), it doesn't fully elaborate on how advantage estimation will be handled in this specific context with potentially delayed rewards from energy and carbon impacts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with existing technology and methods. The use of Kubernetes and Kubeflow for deployment provides a practical implementation path. The data sources (Google Cluster Workload Traces, energy and carbon data from public APIs) are accessible. The PPO algorithm is well-established and has been successfully applied to similar control problems. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require significant effort: (1) building a high-fidelity simulator that accurately models data center dynamics, energy consumption, and carbon emissions; (2) scaling the approach to 10,000 nodes in simulation and then to real-world deployments; (3) integrating with existing data center management systems for power capping and VM migration. The two-phase approach (simulator training followed by real-world fine-tuning) mitigates some risks, but the complexity of the full system integration remains substantial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem with substantial potential impact. Data centers consume 1-2% of global electricity and contribute 0.3% of global CO₂ emissions, making any improvements in this area meaningful. The expected outcomes of 15-30% reduction in energy costs and 20-40% lower carbon emissions would translate to meaningful environmental and economic benefits if widely adopted. The proposal also contributes to the research community by establishing RL as a viable methodology for systems optimization and providing an open-source framework for future work. The alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals further enhances its significance. While the immediate impact depends on adoption by cloud providers, the potential annual savings of 2.1M tons of CO₂ represents a substantial contribution to sustainability efforts in computing."
