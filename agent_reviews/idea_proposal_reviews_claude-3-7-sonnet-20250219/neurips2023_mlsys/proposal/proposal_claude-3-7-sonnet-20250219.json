    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the ML for Systems workshop's focus on applying ML to systems challenges, particularly in the area of compute sustainability and carbon/energy optimization, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest. The proposal expands on the initial GreenSched idea by developing a comprehensive framework (GreenScaler) that incorporates all the key elements: reinforcement learning for scheduling, consideration of energy costs and carbon emissions, and integration with Kubernetes. The proposal also builds upon the literature review, citing similar works like CarbonClipper and CarbonScaler while addressing their limitations by creating a more comprehensive, adaptable solution that considers the complex interplay between performance, energy, and carbon emissions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The problem formulation is particularly strong, with precise mathematical definitions of the state space, action space, and reward function. The architecture of the system is clearly explained, and the experimental design is comprehensive. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) some technical details about the neural network architecture are mentioned but not fully elaborated, (2) the exact mechanism for integrating with Kubernetes could be more detailed, and (3) while Figure 1 and Figure 2 are referenced, they are not included in the proposal, which slightly reduces clarity when discussing the system architecture and neural network design."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several innovative elements. The multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that simultaneously optimizes for energy cost, carbon emissions, and SLA compliance is a fresh perspective compared to existing solutions that often focus on a single objective. The incorporation of LLM workloads, which have unique resource consumption patterns, is timely and addresses an emerging challenge. The hierarchical framework with monitoring, prediction, and control components is also well-conceived. However, the core techniques (PPO for RL, attention mechanisms for neural networks) are established methods rather than novel innovations, and the approach builds incrementally on existing carbon-aware scheduling systems like those mentioned in the literature review rather than proposing a fundamentally new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The MDP formulation is mathematically sound, with well-defined state and action spaces, and a comprehensive reward function that captures the multi-objective nature of the problem. The choice of PPO as the RL algorithm is well-justified given its stability and sample efficiency. The neural network architecture with embedding layers and attention mechanisms is appropriate for the complex state space. The experimental design is thorough, with clear baselines, diverse workload scenarios, and multiple evaluation metrics. The data collection approach using real-world traces and power models adds to the rigor. One minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions prediction models for forecasting energy prices and carbon intensity, it doesn't fully detail these models or address how prediction errors might affect the overall system performance, though sensitivity analysis is mentioned."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with a clear implementation path. The use of existing workload traces, energy price data, and carbon intensity measurements makes data collection realistic. The phased approach—starting with simulations before moving to a real-world Kubernetes deployment—is pragmatic. The technical components (RL algorithms, neural networks, Kubernetes integration) are all implementable with current technology. However, there are some feasibility challenges: (1) the complexity of the full system with all its components may require significant engineering effort, (2) obtaining accurate power models for diverse server types could be difficult, (3) the real-time integration with electricity pricing and carbon intensity APIs depends on external data sources that may have limitations, and (4) the computational overhead of the RL-based scheduler itself might be significant, especially for large-scale deployments, though this is acknowledged as an evaluation metric."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem at the intersection of computing, energy systems, and environmental sustainability. With datacenters consuming 1-2% of global electricity and contributing 0.3% of carbon emissions (figures cited in the proposal), even modest improvements can have substantial real-world impact. The expected outcomes—15-30% reductions in energy costs and 20-40% reductions in carbon emissions—would be significant if achieved. The multi-objective approach that balances environmental impact with performance is particularly valuable for practical adoption. The open-source release of the framework would contribute to the research community and potentially accelerate progress in sustainable computing. The proposal also aligns well with industry trends toward greater environmental responsibility in cloud computing. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on a specific application (datacenter scheduling) rather than a broader methodological contribution to ML for Systems, but within its domain, the potential impact is substantial."
