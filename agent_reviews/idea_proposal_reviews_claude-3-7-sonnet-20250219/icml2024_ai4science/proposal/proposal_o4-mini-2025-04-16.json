    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Scaling in AI for Science' by proposing a Symmetry-Driven Adaptive Scaling (SDAS) pipeline for molecular dynamics. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including the three-stage pipeline with equivariant transformer architecture, physics-informed scaling laws, and active sampling with uncertainty quantification. It thoroughly builds upon the literature review, citing relevant works like Equiformer and NequIP for equivariant architectures, and addressing the challenges identified in the review such as computational efficiency, physical symmetries, and interpretability. The proposal's focus on pushing the methodology-interpretability-discovery Pareto frontier directly responds to the task's interest areas."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical formulations are precisely defined with appropriate mathematical notation, particularly in the equivariant self-attention mechanism and uncertainty estimation sections. The methodology is broken down into logical components with detailed explanations of each step. The algorithmic presentation of the active sampling loop enhances understanding. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for transitioning between the three stages of the pipeline could be more explicitly stated, (2) some technical terms (e.g., 'Clebsch-Gordan projections') might benefit from brief explanations for interdisciplinary audiences, and (3) the relationship between the adaptive scaling rules and the active sampling loop could be more clearly delineated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several innovative elements into a cohesive framework. The integration of equivariant transformers with adaptive scaling laws and active learning for molecular dynamics represents a fresh approach. The physics-informed scaling policy that dynamically allocates computation and data is particularly innovative. However, many of the individual components build upon existing work: equivariant neural networks (Equiformer, NequIP), transformer architectures, and active learning strategies are all established in the literature. The novelty lies more in their integration and application to molecular dynamics foundation models rather than in fundamentally new algorithmic innovations. The proposal acknowledges this by citing relevant prior work while clearly articulating how SDAS extends beyond these approaches through its comprehensive pipeline and focus on scaling efficiency."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is well-founded in established theoretical principles. The equivariant transformer architecture is mathematically formulated with precise tensor operations that preserve SE(3)/E(3) symmetries. The physics-informed scaling laws are grounded in empirical observations about diminishing returns in large-scale training. The active sampling approach uses principled uncertainty quantification methods. The evaluation metrics and experimental validation plan are appropriate and comprehensive. The proposal correctly identifies the importance of symmetry preservation in molecular dynamics and provides a mathematically sound approach to enforce these constraints. There are minor areas that could benefit from additional justification: (1) the choice of specific hyperparameters in the adaptive scaling rules, (2) the rationale for the particular form of the empirical scaling law, and (3) more detailed analysis of how the ensemble-based uncertainty estimation would perform in high-dimensional molecular spaces."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with realistic implementation paths. The equivariant transformer architecture builds on established frameworks like Equiformer and NequIP, suggesting practical implementability. The data sources (OCP, MD17) are publicly available, and the computational requirements, while substantial, are within reach of modern high-performance computing resources. The active learning loop is well-defined with a clear algorithm. However, there are some implementation challenges that merit consideration: (1) training large-scale equivariant transformers may require significant computational resources, potentially limiting accessibility; (2) the adaptive scaling approach requires careful monitoring and hyperparameter tuning that could be complex in practice; (3) the high-fidelity simulations required for active learning (e.g., DFT calculations) can be computationally expensive, potentially creating bottlenecks; and (4) the integration of all components into a seamless pipeline may present engineering challenges not fully addressed in the proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in applying AI to molecular dynamics: balancing computational efficiency with accuracy and interpretability. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions. First, the promised 2Ã— improvement in accuracy-per-FLOP would significantly reduce computational costs for high-accuracy MD simulations, democratizing access to these tools. Second, the enhanced interpretability through symmetry-aware features could lead to new scientific insights about molecular interactions. Third, the general methodology (equivariant transformers, physics-informed scaling, active learning) could transfer to other scientific domains beyond MD. The proposal explicitly connects to broader scientific goals in drug discovery and materials design, areas with significant societal impact. The commitment to open science through code and model release further amplifies potential impact. While the significance is high, it stops short of being transformative as it builds on and improves existing paradigms rather than introducing fundamentally new approaches to molecular modeling."
