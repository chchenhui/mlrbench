        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on modeling interactions between humans, algorithmic decision-making, and society. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the task description, including feedback loops between human and algorithmic decisions, their long-term impacts, and fairness approaches to mitigate disparate impact. The proposal's emphasis on dynamic causal modeling to understand recursive influences between algorithms and human behavior perfectly matches the workshop's goal of understanding 'complex interactions as a whole.' The idea also incorporates elements of strategic behavior and societal outcomes, which are explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a well-defined problem (algorithmic feedback loops causing societal harms), a methodological approach (dynamic causal framework with structural causal models), and expected outcomes (toolkit, training schemes, benchmarks). The integration of reinforcement learning with equilibrium analysis is clearly explained as a means to identify harmful feedback conditions. While the overall structure is logical and coherent, some technical details about how the 'intervention modules' would specifically work to regularize algorithms could benefit from further elaboration. The connection between causal modeling and practical system design is mentioned but could be more precisely defined in terms of implementation steps."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to algorithmic fairness by shifting focus from static datasets to dynamic, evolving interactions. The integration of causal modeling with reinforcement learning to address feedback loops represents an innovative methodological contribution. While individual components (causal modeling, fairness in ML) exist in the literature, the comprehensive framework that connects theoretical causal analysis with practical system design for long-term equity represents a fresh perspective. The concept of 'intervention modules' that specifically target the amplification of disparities over time appears to be a novel contribution to the field. The idea doesn't completely reinvent the foundations of algorithmic fairness but offers a substantial new direction by emphasizing temporal dynamics and recursive effects."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate feasibility challenges. While structural causal models and reinforcement learning are established methodologies, accurately modeling complex human-algorithm interactions with causal fidelity is notoriously difficult. The proposal mentions validation using synthetic and real-world datasets, but obtaining appropriate real-world data that captures the temporal dynamics of feedback loops may be challenging. The integration of equilibrium analysis with reinforcement learning is technically complex and may require significant methodological innovation. The development of intervention modules that effectively balance utility maximization with societal impact presents both technical and normative challenges, as defining and measuring 'societal impact' involves value judgments that may vary across contexts. While the overall approach is sound, implementation would likely require substantial resources and interdisciplinary expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical problem in algorithmic decision-making with far-reaching societal implications. As algorithms increasingly mediate social, economic, and political interactions, understanding and mitigating harmful feedback loops is of paramount importance. The proposed framework could significantly advance our ability to design more equitable algorithmic systems that avoid reinforcing or amplifying existing disparities. The practical outputs (toolkit, training schemes, benchmarks) have clear potential for real-world impact by enabling developers and policymakers to audit and improve deployed systems. By bridging theory and practice, the research could influence both academic understanding and industry implementation of more responsible AI systems. The focus on long-term, dynamic effects rather than static fairness metrics represents an important shift in how we evaluate algorithmic impacts on society."
