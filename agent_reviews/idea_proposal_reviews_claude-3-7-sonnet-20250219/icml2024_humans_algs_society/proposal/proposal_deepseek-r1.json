    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on modeling interactions between humans, algorithmic decision-making, and society, with particular emphasis on feedback loops and their long-term impacts. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including dynamic causal modeling, structural causal models, reinforcement learning integration, and intervention modules for equitable outcomes. The literature review is thoroughly integrated, with specific references to papers on causal inference [1], reinforcement learning [2], structural causal models [3], equilibrium analysis [4], filter bubbles [5], credit scoring [6], intervention modules [7], auditing feedback risks [8], policy-aware training [9], and benchmarks for long-term fairness [10]. The only minor limitation is that the proposal could have more explicitly addressed some workshop topics like foundation models for interpretable human behavior."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research design is logically organized into four distinct phases with well-defined mathematical formulations that precisely describe the proposed causal relationships, reinforcement learning integration, and intervention mechanisms. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and significance, while the methodology section provides concrete details on implementation. The expected outcomes and impact sections clearly articulate the deliverables and their potential benefits. However, some technical aspects could benefit from additional clarification, particularly regarding how the dispersion index is calculated and how the human behavioral model (g_φ) is learned or estimated. Additionally, while the mathematical formulations are precise, a visual representation of the causal model would have enhanced clarity further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant originality by integrating multiple methodological approaches (structural causal models, reinforcement learning, and equilibrium analysis) into a unified framework for modeling algorithm-human feedback loops. This integration represents a novel contribution to the field, as most existing approaches focus on either static fairness metrics or short-term interventions without considering dynamic interactions. The adaptive intervention modules that adjust algorithmic parameters in response to emerging disparities are particularly innovative. The proposal also introduces new concepts like 'policy-aware training' and 'equilibrium-aware exploration' that extend beyond current practices. While individual components (causal modeling, RL, fairness metrics) exist in the literature, their combination and application to long-term societal outcomes represents a fresh perspective. The proposal could have scored higher if it had more explicitly detailed how its approach fundamentally differs from or improves upon specific state-of-the-art methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations by building on established methods in causal inference, reinforcement learning, and fairness research. The mathematical formulations for the structural causal model and reinforcement learning integration are technically sound and well-justified. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics for both short-term and long-term outcomes. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved. The proposal does not fully address potential identification challenges in the causal model, particularly how confounding variables will be handled. The human behavior model (g_φ) lacks detailed specification of how strategic adaptation will be modeled. Additionally, while the fairness regularization approach is promising, the proposal could benefit from more rigorous analysis of potential trade-offs between different fairness metrics and utility maximization. The validation strategy using both synthetic and real-world data is appropriate, but more details on statistical power and validation metrics would strengthen the methodological soundness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, the phased approach provides a clear roadmap for execution, and the use of both synthetic and real-world datasets is practical. The mathematical framework is well-defined and implementable using existing tools and libraries. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) Learning accurate human behavioral models that capture strategic adaptation is notoriously difficult and may require extensive data collection or simplifying assumptions; (2) The computational complexity of simulating long-term feedback loops with multiple agents could be prohibitive, especially for real-world scale applications; (3) Validating causal claims about long-term societal outcomes faces fundamental challenges due to the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual data; (4) The proposal does not specify the computational resources required or provide a detailed timeline for implementation. While the research direction is promising, these practical challenges suggest that the full scope of the proposal may need to be narrowed or extended over a longer timeframe than implied."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in algorithmic fairness research by focusing on long-term societal outcomes rather than static fairness metrics. This shift in perspective has profound implications for how we design, deploy, and regulate algorithmic systems. The potential impact spans multiple domains: (1) Academic significance is high, as the framework bridges machine learning, economics, and social science, potentially creating a new interdisciplinary approach to algorithmic governance; (2) Practical significance is substantial, offering concrete tools for auditing deployed systems and mitigating feedback risks, which directly addresses regulatory needs (e.g., EU AI Act compliance); (3) Societal significance is exceptional, as successful implementation could reduce polarization, enhance economic mobility, and improve transparency in human-algorithm interactions. The proposal tackles fundamental challenges in algorithmic decision-making that affect millions of people through recommendation systems, credit scoring, and hiring platforms. The framework's ability to identify and mitigate harmful equilibria could prevent significant societal harms before they emerge, representing a proactive rather than reactive approach to algorithmic governance."
