        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on modeling interactions between humans, algorithmic decision-making, and society, with particular emphasis on feedback loops and their long-term impacts. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the original idea, including dynamic causal modeling, structural causal models, reinforcement learning, intervention modules, and the goal of ensuring equitable outcomes. It also builds upon the literature review by addressing the identified challenges such as modeling dynamic interactions, ensuring long-term fairness, balancing utility and equity, mitigating unintended consequences, and empirical validation. The methodology section thoroughly explains how these challenges will be tackled using the approaches mentioned in the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is described in detail, including mathematical formulations that add precision. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined, providing a clear roadmap for implementation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific datasets to be used for empirical validation could be more concretely described, (2) the exact mechanisms of the intervention modules could be further elaborated, and (3) the connection between the theoretical framework and practical implementation could be strengthened with more specific examples. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to modeling algorithm-human feedback loops. The integration of dynamic causal modeling with reinforcement learning to address long-term fairness issues represents a fresh perspective compared to traditional static approaches. The concept of 'intervention modules' that regularize algorithms against amplifying disparities over time is innovative. However, many of the individual components (structural causal models, reinforcement learning, etc.) are established techniques, and the literature review suggests that similar approaches have been explored in recent papers. The proposal's novelty lies more in the comprehensive integration of these techniques and the focus on long-term, recursive dynamics rather than in introducing entirely new methodologies. The proposal builds incrementally on existing work rather than presenting a revolutionary approach."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for dynamic causal modeling, structural causal models, reinforcement learning, and intervention modules are correctly presented and appropriate for the research objectives. The methodology is well-grounded in established theoretical frameworks and builds logically on prior work identified in the literature review. The experimental design includes appropriate validation steps, including synthetic data generation, real-world data collection, baseline comparison, and empirical validation using relevant metrics. The evaluation metrics (accuracy, fairness, robustness, intervention effectiveness) are well-chosen to assess the framework's performance. However, there could be more discussion of potential limitations or challenges in the approach, such as computational complexity, scalability issues, or difficulties in obtaining ground truth for causal relationships. Overall, the proposal presents a sound and rigorous approach to addressing the research objectives."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan, though it faces several implementation challenges. The integration of dynamic causal modeling, structural causal models, and reinforcement learning is technically complex and computationally intensive. While each component is established, their combination at scale may present significant engineering challenges. The proposal acknowledges the need for both synthetic and real-world datasets, but obtaining appropriate real-world data that captures the dynamic nature of algorithm-human interactions over time could be difficult. The validation of causal relationships in complex social systems is notoriously challenging. Additionally, the proposal aims to address multiple ambitious objectives (modeling feedback loops, identifying harmful dynamics, empirical validation, ensuring long-term fairness, and policy-aware design) which may be difficult to accomplish within a single research project. The timeline and resource requirements are not explicitly discussed, which raises questions about practical implementation. While the research is feasible in principle, it would require considerable resources, expertise across multiple domains, and potentially longer timeframes than implied."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in algorithmic decision-making with far-reaching societal implications. Understanding and mitigating harmful feedback loops between algorithms and human behavior is essential for ensuring equitable outcomes in domains such as social media, credit scoring, hiring, and recommendation systems. The potential impact is substantial: (1) The toolkit for auditing feedback risks could help platforms identify and prevent harmful dynamics before they cause significant damage; (2) Policy-aware training schemes could lead to more responsible AI deployment across industries; (3) Benchmarks for long-term fairness could establish new standards for algorithm evaluation; and (4) The policy recommendations could influence regulatory frameworks. The work bridges theory and practice in a way that could transform how algorithms are designed, deployed, and governed. The focus on long-term, dynamic interactions rather than static fairness metrics represents an important paradigm shift in algorithmic fairness research. The proposal directly addresses pressing societal concerns about algorithmic harms while offering concrete solutions."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This is an excellent proposal that addresses a critical gap in algorithmic fairness research by focusing on dynamic, long-term interactions between algorithms and humans rather than static datasets. It presents a comprehensive framework that integrates causal modeling, reinforcement learning, and intervention design in a novel way. The proposal is technically sound, well-aligned with the workshop's focus, and has significant potential for real-world impact. While there are some concerns about feasibility due to the complexity of the approach and potential data limitations, the importance of the problem and the thoughtfulness of the methodology justify pursuing this research direction.
