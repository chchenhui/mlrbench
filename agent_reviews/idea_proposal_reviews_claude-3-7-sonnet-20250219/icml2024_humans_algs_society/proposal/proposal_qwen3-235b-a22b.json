    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on modeling interactions between humans, algorithmic decision-making, and society, with particular emphasis on feedback loops and their long-term impacts. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including dynamic causal modeling, structural causal models, reinforcement learning with equilibrium analysis, and intervention modules for equity. The literature review is thoroughly integrated, with specific citations to relevant works (e.g., Doe et al., Davis et al., Martinez et al., Taylor et al.) that inform the theoretical framework, methodology, and expected outcomes. The only minor inconsistency is that some papers mentioned in the literature review (e.g., Clark & Lewis on intervention modules) could have been more explicitly connected to the proposed intervention modules."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research questions and goals are explicitly stated in the introduction, and the methodology section provides detailed explanations of data collection, SCM construction, RL for equilibrium analysis, and intervention modules. The technical aspects are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations that enhance understanding rather than obscuring it. The experimental design is laid out in a systematic table format that clearly communicates the evaluation approach. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanisms by which the intervention modules will be integrated into real-world systems could be more detailed, and (2) some technical terms (e.g., 'KL-Divergence', 'ATE accuracy') are used without sufficient explanation for readers who might not be familiar with these concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant originality in its approach to algorithmic fairness by integrating multiple methodologies (causal modeling, reinforcement learning, and game theory) to address dynamic feedback loops. The innovation lies particularly in: (1) formalizing algorithm-human interactions as recursive structural causal models with temporal dimensions, (2) developing intervention modules that specifically target long-term equity rather than just immediate fairness metrics, and (3) creating a comprehensive framework that bridges theoretical modeling with practical system design. While individual components (SCMs, RL, fairness constraints) have been explored in prior work as noted in the literature review, their integration into a cohesive framework for modeling and mitigating feedback loops represents a novel contribution. The proposal could have scored higher if it had more explicitly articulated how its approach fundamentally differs from or extends beyond the existing work on intervention modules (Clark & Lewis) or policy-aware training (Young & King)."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-founded and rigorous in its theoretical formulations and methodological approach. The structural causal model is properly specified with clear variables and causal equations, and the reinforcement learning framework for equilibrium analysis is technically sound. The intervention modules are mathematically formulated with appropriate loss functions and constraints. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the proposal does not fully address how unobserved confounding variables will be handled in the causal inference framework, despite mentioning this challenge, (2) the convergence analysis for detecting harmful feedback equilibria is stated but not thoroughly justified mathematically, and (3) while the experimental design includes baseline models and statistical validation, the specific statistical tests for comparing interventions are not detailed. The proposal acknowledges theoretical challenges but could provide more rigorous solutions to some of the technical issues it raises."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined stages, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The use of both synthetic data (for controlled experiments) and real-world datasets (YouTube recommender logs, LendingClub) strengthens the practical implementability. The computational pipeline is logically structured, and the technical requirements appear reasonable for a research project. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) the proposal mentions using YouTube recommender logs but doesn't address potential data access limitations or privacy concerns, (2) the simulation of 500+ iterations of feedback cycles using RL may be computationally intensive and time-consuming, (3) validating the causal effects in real-world systems is challenging due to the inability to run true counterfactual experiments, and (4) the proposal doesn't fully address how the intervention modules would be deployed in production systems where there might be competing business objectives. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they do present significant implementation hurdles that would need to be carefully managed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in algorithmic fairness with far-reaching implications for society. Its significance is evident in several dimensions: (1) theoretical advancement in understanding dynamic feedback loops between algorithms and humans, (2) practical tools for auditing and mitigating harmful algorithmic effects, (3) policy relevance for regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act, and (4) applications across multiple domains including education, finance, and healthcare. The expected outcomes—particularly the dynamic causal toolkit, policy-aware algorithms, and benchmarks for equitable reinforcement learning—would provide valuable resources for both researchers and practitioners. The proposal explicitly quantifies potential impact (e.g., '45% reduction in polarization while maintaining 80% engagement rates' and '20% reduction in racial default disparities'), making its significance concrete and measurable. The work directly addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review and has the potential to shift how algorithmic fairness is conceptualized from static to dynamic frameworks."
