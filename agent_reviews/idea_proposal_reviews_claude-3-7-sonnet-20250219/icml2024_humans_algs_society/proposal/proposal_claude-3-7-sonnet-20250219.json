    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on modeling interactions between humans, algorithmic decision-making, and society, with particular emphasis on feedback loops and their long-term impacts. The proposal incorporates the key elements from the research idea, including dynamic causal modeling, structural causal models, and intervention modules. It also builds upon the literature review by citing relevant works (e.g., Doe & Smith, 2023; Davis & Brown, 2023; Taylor & White, 2023; Harris & Robinson, 2023; Martinez & Wilson, 2023) and addressing the key challenges identified in the review. The methodology section thoroughly develops the theoretical framework suggested in the idea, and the expected outcomes align with the proposed deliverables (audit toolkit, intervention modules, and benchmarks)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and research objectives. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the dynamic causal framework, feedback loop identification, intervention module design, and empirical validation approaches. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-presented, with clear notation and explanations. The expected outcomes section clearly articulates the theoretical contributions, practical tools, and broader impacts. However, there are a few areas where additional clarity would be beneficial, particularly in explaining how the intervention modules would be implemented in real-world systems and how the empirical validation would address potential confounding factors. Some technical concepts (e.g., the counterfactual term in the FeedbackStrength metric) could benefit from further elaboration for interdisciplinary audiences."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to algorithmic fairness. While individual components (causal modeling, reinforcement learning, game theory) have been explored separately in the literature, the integration of these methods into a comprehensive framework for analyzing and mitigating algorithm-human feedback loops represents an innovative contribution. The dynamic causal framework extends beyond traditional static fairness measures, addressing a critical gap in current approaches. The feedback metrics and intervention modules introduce novel methodological tools for identifying and addressing harmful feedback effects. The proposal's emphasis on temporal equity and long-term fairness trajectories offers a fresh perspective on algorithmic governance. However, some elements, such as causal regularization and adversarial training, build incrementally on existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations, drawing appropriately from causal inference, reinforcement learning, and game theory. The structural causal model is well-formulated, with clear mathematical definitions of variables and their temporal evolution. The feedback loop identification methods are grounded in established techniques from dynamical systems theory. The intervention module designs incorporate sound principles from regularization theory and constrained optimization. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened. The stability analysis using eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix assumes linearizability of the system, which may not hold in complex social systems with non-linear dynamics. The proposal acknowledges the need for sensitivity analyses but could more explicitly address potential identification challenges in the causal framework. The empirical validation plan is comprehensive but could benefit from more detailed discussion of potential confounding factors and how they would be addressed in the experimental design."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research agenda, but with significant implementation challenges. The synthetic data simulation and semi-synthetic experiments are clearly achievable with existing computational resources and methodologies. The development of the feedback audit toolkit and intervention module library is technically feasible given the described approaches. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns. The real-world case studies require partnerships with platform providers, which may be difficult to establish given potential commercial and reputational risks. The temporal scope of the experiments (3-6 months) may be insufficient to observe meaningful long-term feedback effects in complex social systems. The proposal's ambitious integration of causal modeling, reinforcement learning, and game theory requires interdisciplinary expertise that may be challenging to coordinate. The mathematical framework, while theoretically sound, may face practical limitations when applied to real-world systems with high-dimensional state spaces and complex human behaviors that are difficult to model accurately."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem at the intersection of algorithmic decision-making and societal welfare. The significance of understanding and mitigating harmful feedback loops in algorithmic systems is substantial, given their increasing deployment in high-stakes domains like content recommendation, credit allocation, and hiring. The theoretical contributions would advance our understanding of dynamic fairness, providing a foundation for future research on algorithm-human interactions. The practical tools (audit toolkit, intervention modules, policy-aware training) would enable technology companies to assess and mitigate the long-term societal impacts of their systems. The benchmarks for long-term fairness would establish new standards for evaluating algorithmic systems beyond short-term performance metrics. The interdisciplinary nature of the work would bridge machine learning, causal inference, economics, and social science, fostering collaboration on algorithmic fairness issues. The potential societal impact is considerable, addressing pressing concerns about algorithmic systems reinforcing inequities or creating new forms of discrimination."
