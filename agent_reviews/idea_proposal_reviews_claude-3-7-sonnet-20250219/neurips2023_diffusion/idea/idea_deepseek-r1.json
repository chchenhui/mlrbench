        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on diffusion models. It specifically addresses the application of diffusion models to inverse problems, which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposal explores conditional generation and solving inverse problems in imaging, which are key application areas highlighted in the task description. The idea also touches on methodology improvements for diffusion models by introducing a novel framework for handling ambiguity, which aligns with the 'Novel training methodology or architectures' topic. The focus on medical CT reconstruction and microscopy deconvolution also fits well with the 'Science and engineering applications' mentioned in the workshop topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (ambiguity in inverse problems), proposes a specific solution (conditional diffusion model with latent space encoding uncertainty), and outlines the expected outcomes. The technical approach involving conditional diffusion models, latent codes, and hybrid sampling is explained concisely. The integration of cross-attention and likelihood-aware loss is mentioned, though these could benefit from slightly more elaboration on their specific implementation. The application domains (medical CT reconstruction and microscopy deconvolution) are clearly specified. Overall, the idea is presented with good clarity, with only minor ambiguities in the technical details of the implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by specifically addressing the challenge of ambiguity in inverse problems using diffusion models. While diffusion models have been applied to inverse problems before, the explicit focus on modeling multiple plausible solutions and the proposed architecture combining conditional diffusion with a specialized latent space for encoding uncertainty represents a fresh approach. The hybrid sampling strategy that incorporates task-specific constraints is also innovative. However, the core components (conditional diffusion models, latent codes, cross-attention) are established techniques being combined in a new way rather than fundamentally new methods. The approach builds upon existing work in diffusion models and inverse problems rather than introducing an entirely new paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology and methods. Diffusion models are well-established, and conditional variants have been successfully implemented in various domains. The proposed integration of latent codes to represent uncertainty is technically sound and implementable. The specific application domains (CT reconstruction and microscopy deconvolution) have existing datasets and evaluation protocols. The hybrid sampling strategy might require careful tuning to balance diversity and constraint satisfaction, but this is manageable. The computational requirements would be significant but not prohibitive given current GPU resources. The proposal builds on established techniques and extends them in ways that don't require theoretical breakthroughs or new fundamental algorithms, making it quite practical to implement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses an important limitation in current approaches to inverse problems: the inability to capture multiple plausible solutions. This is particularly significant in medical imaging and scientific applications where understanding the range of possible interpretations can be critical for decision-making. The potential impact extends beyond the specific applications mentioned to any domain with ambiguous inverse problems. By enabling uncertainty quantification and exploratory analysis, the approach could meaningfully advance scientific imaging and diagnostic capabilities. The work bridges generative modeling and scientific inverse problem solving, potentially influencing both fields. While not revolutionary in its approach, the practical benefits for real-world applications in medicine and science give it substantial significance."
