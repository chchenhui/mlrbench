        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'AI for cell and gene therapies' component with a focus on 'AI-based CRISPR design' as explicitly mentioned in the Application Track. The proposal also fits well within the ML track by developing a Foundational Model for drug discovery that incorporates multimodal data (genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic) and addresses long-range dependencies in biological sequences. The idea bridges the gap between FMs and design in drug discovery as requested, with specific application to CRISPR guide RNA design. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address how lab feedback would be incorporated into the fine-tuning process beyond the initial training data."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and clearly defined. It specifies the problem (off-target effects in CRISPR), the proposed solution (cell-type-aware Foundational Model), the architecture (transformer-based), the training approach (pre-training on genomic sequences followed by fine-tuning), and the expected outcome (more precise gRNA selection). The integration of multi-modal data is explicitly mentioned, and the conditioning mechanism is explained. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as how exactly the cell-type-specific embeddings would be derived from epigenetic/transcriptomic data, the specific transformer architecture to be used, and how the model would balance on-target efficiency with off-target propensity in its predictions."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining several innovative elements. The integration of cell-type-specific context into CRISPR guide RNA design using a foundational model approach is relatively novel. While there are existing tools for gRNA design and some that consider chromatin accessibility, the comprehensive integration of multiple cellular context factors (chromatin accessibility, methylation, transcriptomics) into a unified FM is innovative. The concept of conditioning gRNA predictions on both genomic locus and cellular context as embeddings is a fresh approach. However, the core components (transformer models, multi-modal data integration, fine-tuning on experimental data) are established techniques in the field, limiting the highest novelty score. The innovation lies more in the application and combination rather than introducing fundamentally new methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Transformer-based models have been successfully applied to genomic sequences, and there are established methods for integrating multi-modal biological data. The necessary data types (ATAC-seq, methylation, transcriptomics, experimental CRISPR outcomes) are available for many cell types. However, there are implementation challenges: (1) obtaining sufficient experimental on-target/off-target data across diverse cell types for fine-tuning may be resource-intensive; (2) modeling long-range genomic dependencies requires significant computational resources; (3) creating meaningful embeddings from heterogeneous epigenetic data that effectively capture cellular context is non-trivial; and (4) validating the model's predictions would require extensive experimental work. These challenges are substantial but surmountable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical problem in gene therapy development. Off-target effects remain one of the major safety concerns limiting clinical applications of CRISPR technologies. A model that can accurately predict cell-type-specific gRNA efficiency and specificity would have substantial impact by: (1) improving safety profiles of gene therapies; (2) reducing the need for extensive experimental screening; (3) enabling more personalized therapeutic approaches; and (4) potentially accelerating the development timeline for new gene therapies. The significance extends beyond academic interest to direct clinical applications, potentially benefiting patients with genetic disorders. The cell-type-specific approach is particularly valuable as it addresses the reality that gene therapies must function in specific target tissues with unique cellular environments."
