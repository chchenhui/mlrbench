        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the HAIC 2025 workshop's focus on human-AI coevolution and feedback loops. It directly addresses the workshop's interest in 'Dynamic Feedback Loops in Socially Impactful Domains' (healthcare), 'Socio-Technological Bias, Norms, and Ethics' (through its focus on bias mitigation), and 'Algorithmic Adaptation and Robustness' (via the bias-aware co-correction mechanism). The proposal specifically examines bidirectional adaptation between AI systems and patients in healthcare, which perfectly matches the workshop's emphasis on understanding how humans and AI systems coadapt over time. The introduction of the 'looping inequity' metric also aligns with the call for 'revising evaluation metrics to assess AI systems through the lens of HAIC.'"

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a three-part methodology: (1) a simulation framework for modeling human-AI coevolution, (2) a bias-aware co-correction mechanism, and (3) validation through a diabetes management case study. The proposal clearly defines its novel metric ('looping inequity') and articulates expected outcomes. The only minor ambiguities relate to the specific implementation details of the causal mediation analysis and how exactly the patient explanations will be designed to recalibrate trust. While these technical aspects could benefit from further elaboration, the overall structure and objectives of the research are well-articulated and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea demonstrates significant originality in several ways. First, it shifts from static fairness interventions to dynamic, coevolutionary approaches in healthcare AI—addressing a critical gap in current research. Second, the proposed 'bias-aware co-correction' mechanism represents a novel technical contribution that combines causal mediation analysis with explainable AI for patients. Third, the introduction of 'looping inequity' as a metric offers a new conceptual framework for evaluating fairness in dynamic systems. The integration of reinforcement learning, causal analysis, and patient-centered design in a longitudinal framework represents a fresh approach that goes beyond existing work in algorithmic fairness, which typically focuses on point-in-time interventions rather than sustained interactions."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible but faces some implementation challenges. The simulation framework using reinforcement learning agents is technically achievable with current methods. The diabetes management case study provides a concrete application domain with available datasets. However, several aspects present moderate challenges: (1) accurately modeling patient adaptation to AI recommendations requires sophisticated behavioral models that may be difficult to validate; (2) causal mediation analysis in complex healthcare scenarios with numerous confounding variables is methodologically challenging; (3) designing effective explanations that recalibrate patient trust requires interdisciplinary expertise in both AI and behavioral science. While these challenges are substantial, they don't render the project infeasible—rather, they require careful methodological consideration and potentially iterative refinement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical problem at the intersection of healthcare AI, algorithmic fairness, and human-AI interaction. Its significance is substantial for several reasons: (1) healthcare AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings where bias can directly impact patient outcomes and health disparities; (2) the longitudinal perspective on fairness fills an important gap in current research, which often neglects how biases evolve over time; (3) the proposed framework could generalize beyond diabetes management to other chronic conditions requiring ongoing AI-supported care; (4) the anticipated 25-40% reduction in disparities compared to static approaches would represent a meaningful improvement in health equity. The work bridges technical AI research with participatory design and healthcare ethics, offering potential impact across multiple disciplines and direct applications to real-world healthcare challenges."
