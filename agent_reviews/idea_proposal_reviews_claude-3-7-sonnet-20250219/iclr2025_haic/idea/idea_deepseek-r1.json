        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the HAIC 2025 workshop focus. It directly addresses the core theme of human-AI coevolution by examining feedback loops in human-AI coadaptation, particularly in high-stakes domains like criminal justice. The proposal spans multiple subject areas from the task description, including 'Dynamic Feedback Loops in Socially Impactful Domains,' 'Socio-Technological Bias, Norms, and Ethics,' and 'Algorithmic Adaptation and Robustness.' The focus on bias trajectories and mitigation strategies in systems where humans and AI adapt to each other over time is precisely what the workshop seeks to explore. The only minor limitation is that it could more explicitly address the 'multiple levels of analysis' mentioned in the task description, though this is implied in the methodology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, methodology, and expected outcomes. The proposal defines a specific problem (dynamic bias in HAIC systems), outlines a computational framework approach, and explains the validation strategy. Key concepts like 'disparity amplification rates' and 'adaptive debiasing algorithms' are introduced, though some technical details about how these would be implemented could benefit from further elaboration. The connection between agent-based simulations and real-world applications is logically presented. While the overall direction is clear, some specific methodological details about how the counterfactual reasoning and preference-aware RLHF would work in practice remain somewhat abstract, preventing a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant originality by addressing a critical gap in current AI bias mitigation approaches. While bias in AI is a well-studied area, the focus on temporal dynamics and coevolutionary feedback loops represents a novel perspective. The integration of agent-based modeling with reinforcement learning to simulate iterated human-AI interactions over time is an innovative methodological approach. The concept of tracking 'bias trajectories' rather than static bias measurements represents a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize fairness in AI systems. The proposal's emphasis on adaptive debiasing algorithms that update based on real-time interactions is particularly innovative, moving beyond traditional static debiasing methods. This temporal dimension of bias analysis in human-AI systems is underexplored in current literature, making this a highly novel contribution."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally feasible but faces some implementation challenges. The technical components (agent-based simulations, reinforcement learning) are well-established methods, and historical datasets for criminal justice are available. However, accurately modeling human adaptation to AI systems is complex and may require simplifying assumptions that could limit ecological validity. The proposal mentions validation with legal experts, which is practical but may face recruitment challenges. The development of adaptive debiasing algorithms that work in real-time presents technical hurdles, particularly in balancing fairness with utility. The computational resources required for simulating complex coevolutionary dynamics could be substantial. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the project infeasible - rather, they suggest a need for careful scoping and potentially a phased implementation approach."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical gap in AI ethics with potentially far-reaching implications. The focus on high-stakes domains like criminal justice and healthcare means that improvements could directly impact vulnerable populations and reduce systemic inequities. By developing methods to predict and mitigate dynamic bias trajectories, the work could fundamentally change how AI systems are designed, deployed, and regulated in socially impactful contexts. The proposal offers concrete tools for policymakers and system designers to audit and adapt AI systems over time, addressing a pressing need in AI governance. The significance extends beyond technical contributions to include societal impact through more equitable decision-making systems. The work bridges technical AI research with social science and policy considerations, positioning it to influence multiple disciplines and practical applications in critical domains."
