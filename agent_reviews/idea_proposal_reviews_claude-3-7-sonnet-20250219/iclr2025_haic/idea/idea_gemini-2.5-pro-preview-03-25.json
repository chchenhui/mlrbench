        "justification": "The Co-Adapt Metrics idea aligns exceptionally well with the HAIC 2025 workshop's focus on human-AI coevolution and feedback loops. It directly addresses the workshop's call for 'revising evaluation metrics to assess AI systems through the lens of HAIC' and explores 'how prolonged human-AI interactions shape cognition and decision-making.' The proposal specifically targets longitudinal studies of human-AI interaction, which matches the workshop's interest in understanding adaptation over extended periods. The idea also connects to multiple subject areas from the call, including human-AI interaction, bidirectional learning beyond performance metrics, and dynamic feedback loops. The only minor limitation is that it could more explicitly address some of the societal and ethical dimensions mentioned in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The concept of 'Co-Adapt Metrics' is defined precisely as an evaluation framework that assesses AI systems based on human cognitive adaptation over time. The methodology involving longitudinal studies with specific measurements (strategy shifts, decision time, reliance patterns) is well-specified. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from standard benchmarks and articulates its unique focus on the dynamics of adaptation rather than just performance. However, some minor ambiguities remain about the specific tasks that would be used, the exact metrics to be developed, and how the framework would quantify 'beneficial' versus 'detrimental' adaptations, which prevents it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The Co-Adapt Metrics idea represents a highly innovative approach to AI evaluation. While there has been growing interest in human-AI collaboration, the specific focus on longitudinal cognitive adaptation as an evaluation metric is genuinely novel. Most current evaluation frameworks focus on immediate performance or satisfaction rather than tracking cognitive shifts over time. The proposal introduces a paradigm shift from evaluating what AI systems can do to evaluating how they shape human cognition and behavior through extended interaction. This perspective is particularly innovative in proposing concrete measurements of cognitive adaptation patterns rather than just task outcomes. The approach bridges cognitive science and AI evaluation in a way that few existing frameworks attempt, making it a substantially original contribution to the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally feasible but faces some implementation challenges. Longitudinal studies are resource-intensive and time-consuming, requiring sustained participant engagement. Measuring cognitive adaptation reliably presents methodological challenges, particularly in isolating AI-induced changes from other factors. The proposal mentions tracking 'shifts in human strategies' and 'cognitive skill change,' which would require careful experimental design and validated assessment tools. While the core concept is implementable with current technology and methods, the comprehensive framework would require significant expertise in both cognitive assessment and AI evaluation. The idea would benefit from more specific details on study duration, participant selection criteria, and concrete measurement protocols. Nevertheless, with appropriate resources and methodological refinements, the research is certainly achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in AI evaluation that has profound implications for the field. As AI systems become more integrated into human cognitive workflows, understanding their long-term effects on human cognition is essential for responsible development. The proposed metrics could fundamentally change how we design and deploy AI systems, shifting focus from short-term performance to long-term cognitive impact. This work could help prevent detrimental dependencies and skill degradation while promoting beneficial cognitive augmentation. The significance extends beyond academic interest to practical AI design guidelines that could influence how AI is integrated into education, healthcare, scientific research, and other domains where cognitive adaptation matters. By providing a framework to distinguish systems that foster synergistic partnerships from those causing harmful dependencies, this research directly addresses a pressing need in the evolving human-AI ecosystem."
