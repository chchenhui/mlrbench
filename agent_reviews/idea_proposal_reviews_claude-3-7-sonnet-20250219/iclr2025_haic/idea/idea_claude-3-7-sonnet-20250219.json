        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the HAIC 2025 workshop's focus on human-AI coevolution and feedback loops. It specifically addresses the 'Human-AI Interaction and Alignment' subject area, with particular emphasis on the 'Evolution of human expectations and trust in AI systems' which is explicitly mentioned in the task description. The proposal also touches on other relevant areas including ethical implications and long-term alignment risks. The longitudinal approach directly addresses the workshop's interest in extended periods of human-AI interaction, and the focus on trust calibration speaks to the dynamic feedback loops emphasized in the workshop description."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, defining the key concept of 'trust inflation' and outlining a structured three-part methodology. The proposal clearly articulates its motivation, approach, and expected outcomes. The distinction between explicit and implicit trust measurements is well-defined. However, some minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific experimental design details, such as the exact duration of 'extended interaction periods' and the precise mechanisms of the proposed 'trust calibration interrupts.' These details would benefit from further elaboration, but overall the core concept and approach are well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by identifying and focusing on 'trust inflation' as a specific phenomenon in iterative human-AI interaction. While trust in AI systems has been studied before, the proposal correctly identifies a gap in understanding how trust evolves dynamically through repeated interactions, especially as AI systems adapt to human feedback. The longitudinal approach and the concept of 'trust calibration interrupts' appear to be innovative contributions. The combination of empirical studies with computational modeling to track trust evolution over time represents a fresh approach to studying human-AI alignment. The idea builds upon existing work in trust calibration but extends it in novel directions."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally feasible with current technologies and methodologies. Measuring explicit trust through self-reports and implicit trust through behavioral markers is well-established in human factors research. The longitudinal tracking of trust calibration is more challenging but achievable with careful experimental design. The computational modeling component may face challenges in accurately capturing the complex dynamics of trust evolution, and the development of effective 'trust calibration interrupts' will require iterative testing. The proposal would benefit from more specific details on participant recruitment for long-term studies and the technical implementation of adaptive AI systems for the experiments. Overall, the idea is implementable but will require significant resources and careful methodological planning."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical issue in human-AI interaction with substantial implications for AI safety and alignment. Trust inflation could lead to serious consequences in high-stakes domains like healthcare and legal advice, as mentioned in the proposal. Understanding and mitigating this phenomenon is essential for responsible AI deployment. The potential outcomes—a dynamic model of trust evolution and evidence-based design principles—would make valuable contributions to both theoretical understanding and practical applications in AI alignment. The work directly addresses a fundamental challenge in ensuring that AI systems remain beneficial as they adapt to human feedback, making it highly significant for the field of human-AI coevolution."
