    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the HAIC 2025 workshop's focus on human-AI coevolution, particularly in the areas of dynamic feedback loops, bias mitigation, and healthcare applications. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including the simulation framework, bias-aware co-correction mechanism, and validation through diabetes management. It builds upon the literature review by integrating concepts like causal mediation analysis (from Martinez & Wang), the looping inequity metric (from Zhang & Patel), and explainability for trust calibration (from Patel & Nguyen). The methodology section thoroughly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, particularly regarding perpetuation of biases, dynamic feedback loops, and longitudinal impact assessment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the simulation framework, bias-aware co-correction algorithm, and experimental design. Mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined, with clear notation for the MDP framework, reward design, and causal mediation analysis. The pseudocode for the algorithm enhances understanding of the implementation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the relationship between the patient behavior model Ï† and the transition kernel P could be more explicitly defined; (2) the exact mechanism for how explanations recalibrate trust could be elaborated; and (3) the definition of the looping inequity metric L could be more intuitive for non-technical stakeholders."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant originality in several aspects. The integration of causal mediation analysis with reinforcement learning to detect and mitigate bias in human-AI feedback loops represents a novel approach not commonly seen in healthcare AI systems. The introduction of the 'looping inequity' metric provides a new way to quantify disparities arising specifically from human-AI interaction over time, addressing a gap in current evaluation frameworks. The bias-aware co-correction mechanism that combines algorithmic adjustments with patient-facing explanations is innovative in its bidirectional approach to bias mitigation. While individual components (RL, causal analysis, explainability) have been explored separately in the literature, their synthesis into a cohesive framework for addressing dynamic feedback loops in healthcare represents a fresh perspective. The proposal builds upon existing work in a meaningful way rather than proposing entirely new paradigms, which is appropriate given the state of the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and methodological rigor in many aspects. The MDP formulation for the simulation environment is mathematically sound, with clear definitions of states, actions, transitions, and rewards. The causal mediation analysis is well-grounded in established causal inference techniques. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are some limitations to the soundness: (1) The patient behavior model is somewhat simplified, potentially overlooking complex psychological factors that influence adherence and trust; (2) The assumption that trust can be accurately modeled with a simple update equation may not capture the nuanced ways humans develop trust in AI systems; (3) While the proposal acknowledges the need for statistical significance testing, it doesn't fully address potential confounding variables in the simulation environment; (4) The front-door adjustment method for causal mediation may have limitations when applied to complex healthcare scenarios with unmeasured confounders. These issues don't invalidate the approach but suggest areas where additional theoretical development or empirical validation would strengthen the proposal."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a generally feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The use of existing datasets (MIMIC-IV) combined with published cohort statistics provides a practical data foundation. The implementation leverages established tools and frameworks (Python, PyTorch, DoWhy, SHAP) rather than requiring new infrastructure development. The simulation approach allows for controlled experimentation without immediate ethical concerns of deploying potentially biased systems to real patients. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) Creating realistic patient behavior models that accurately reflect how diverse populations respond to AI recommendations is complex and may require additional validation; (2) The computational resources needed for running causal mediation analysis within reinforcement learning loops could be substantial; (3) The proposal doesn't fully address how to validate the simulation against real-world patient-AI interactions, which would be necessary to ensure external validity; (4) The timeline for implementing and evaluating all components (simulation, co-correction algorithm, explanations, trust modeling) is ambitious and may require prioritization of certain aspects."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem at the intersection of AI fairness, healthcare equity, and human-AI interaction. The significance is substantial for several reasons: (1) Healthcare AI systems are increasingly being deployed in clinical settings, making bias mitigation urgent and impactful; (2) The focus on dynamic feedback loops rather than static fairness constraints addresses a fundamental limitation in current approaches; (3) The proposed framework could generalize beyond diabetes management to other chronic conditions and potentially to domains outside healthcare; (4) The introduction of the 'looping inequity' metric provides a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners to evaluate AI systems; (5) The integration of patient trust and explanations acknowledges the socio-technical nature of healthcare AI, potentially improving both adoption and outcomes; (6) The expected reduction in disparities (25-40%) while maintaining clinical effectiveness would represent a meaningful improvement in health equity. The proposal directly addresses multiple priority areas from the HAIC 2025 workshop, particularly around dynamic feedback loops in socially impactful domains and socio-technological bias."
