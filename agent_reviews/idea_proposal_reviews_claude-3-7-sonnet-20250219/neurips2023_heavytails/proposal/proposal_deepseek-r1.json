    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of reframing heavy-tailed distributions as beneficial rather than problematic in machine learning. The proposed Heavy-Tail Gradient Amplification (HTGA) framework perfectly matches the initial idea of leveraging heavy-tailed stochastic gradients for improved generalization. The proposal incorporates relevant literature, citing works from the review such as Raj et al. (2023), Hübler et al. (2024), and Lee et al. (2025), and positions itself as addressing a gap in the existing research. The methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes all consistently support the central thesis that heavy-tailed gradients can be strategically exploited rather than mitigated."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented with appropriate mathematical formulations. The HTGA algorithm is explained in detail, including the update rule and key features. The experimental design section provides specific information about datasets, models, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The only minor areas that could benefit from additional clarity are: (1) more detailed explanation of how the Hill estimator will be implemented efficiently during training, (2) further justification for the specific hyperparameter choices (e.g., why α_target = 3), and (3) more explicit connection between the theoretical analysis and the practical implementation. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a genuinely novel approach to handling heavy-tailed gradients in machine learning. While existing methods (as cited in the literature review) focus on mitigating or providing convergence guarantees under heavy-tailed conditions, HTGA takes the innovative step of actively amplifying heavy-tailed characteristics when beneficial. The dynamic adjustment of optimization parameters based on tail index estimation represents a fresh perspective. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work that treats heavy tails as problematic, positioning HTGA as a paradigm shift. The novelty is somewhat constrained by building on established concepts (Hill estimator, adaptive optimization), but the combination and application to leverage rather than suppress heavy-tailed behavior is distinctly original."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The use of the Hill estimator for tail index estimation is appropriate, and the HTGA update rule is mathematically coherent. However, there are some areas where the theoretical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the proposal lacks detailed convergence analysis for the HTGA algorithm, (2) there is limited discussion of potential instabilities that might arise from amplifying heavy-tailed gradients, and (3) the relationship between the tail index and generalization performance is asserted but not thoroughly justified with theoretical arguments. The experimental design is comprehensive and well-planned, with appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. Overall, while the approach is well-founded, some theoretical aspects would benefit from more rigorous development."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The implementation of HTGA appears practical, requiring only modest modifications to standard optimization algorithms. The experimental setup with specified datasets, models, and computational resources is realistic. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the computational overhead of repeatedly estimating tail indices during training could be significant, especially for large models, (2) the sensitivity of the Hill estimator to the choice of k (number of upper-order statistics) is not addressed, and (3) the proposal does not fully discuss potential challenges in tuning the hyperparameters α_target and γ across different architectures and datasets. The infrastructure requirements (4 NVIDIA A6000 GPUs) are substantial but reasonable for the proposed experiments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important gap in machine learning optimization and has the potential for significant impact. By reframing heavy-tailed gradients as beneficial rather than problematic, it challenges a fundamental assumption in the field. If successful, HTGA could lead to improved generalization performance, particularly in low-data regimes, which has broad applications across domains. The theoretical contributions would advance our understanding of the relationship between gradient distributions and generalization. The practical significance is enhanced by the proposal's focus on providing guidelines for hyperparameter selection and demonstrating improvements on standard benchmarks. The work aligns well with emerging trends in optimization research and could influence future algorithm design. While revolutionary breakthroughs are not guaranteed, the potential for meaningful advancement in both theory and practice is substantial."
