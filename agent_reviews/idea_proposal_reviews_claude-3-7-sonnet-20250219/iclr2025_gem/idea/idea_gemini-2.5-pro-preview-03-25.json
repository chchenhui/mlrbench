        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the GEM workshop's goals of bridging generative ML with experimental biology. It specifically addresses the 'Adaptive experimental design' topic in the Biology track and touches on 'Inverse design of biomolecules' from the ML track. The proposal creates a feedback loop between computational predictions and wet lab validation, which is central to the workshop's mission. However, it doesn't explicitly address the workshop's emphasis on benchmark performance versus real-world applications, which is why it doesn't receive a perfect score."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with exceptional clarity. It clearly defines the problem (antibody affinity maturation), the proposed solution (integrating generative models with active learning), and the workflow (generation, selection, experimental testing, and model refinement). The proposal specifies concrete examples of models (ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF) and experimental techniques (yeast display, SPR). The closed-loop nature of the system is well-articulated, making the iterative improvement process easy to understand. The only minor ambiguity is in the details of how the acquisition function would be designed and optimized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines existing approaches (generative protein models and active learning) in a potentially powerful way for antibody design. While neither generative protein design nor active learning is new, their integration specifically for antibody affinity maturation with a closed experimental feedback loop represents a fresh approach. The novelty lies in the systematic coupling of computational prediction with experimental validation in an iterative framework. However, similar active learning approaches have been applied in other domains of molecular design, which is why the score isn't higher. The proposal extends existing paradigms rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible with current technology. Generative protein models like ProteinMPNN and ESM-IF are established tools, and experimental techniques for measuring antibody binding (yeast display, SPR) are standard in the field. Active learning frameworks are well-developed in machine learning. The main implementation challenges would be in establishing the experimental pipeline, ensuring model retraining is efficient between iterations, and developing effective acquisition functions. These are substantial but surmountable challenges. The proposal wisely limits experimental testing to small batches, making the approach practically implementable within reasonable resource constraints."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical challenge in therapeutic antibody development. Antibody optimization is typically resource-intensive and time-consuming, and improving this process could accelerate drug development and reduce costs. The approach could significantly increase the hit rate of finding high-affinity antibodies while minimizing experimental overhead. Beyond antibodies, the framework could potentially be extended to other therapeutic proteins and enzymes. The direct integration with experimental validation aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of bridging computational and experimental approaches, making it particularly significant in this context. The potential impact on both scientific understanding and practical applications in biomedicine is substantial."
