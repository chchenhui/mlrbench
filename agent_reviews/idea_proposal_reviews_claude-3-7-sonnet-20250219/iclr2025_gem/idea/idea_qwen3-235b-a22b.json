        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Adaptive experimental design' area mentioned in the Biology track of the GEM workshop. The proposal directly tackles the disconnect between ML models and experimental validation that the workshop aims to bridge. It offers a concrete approach to integrate computational predictions with wet lab experiments through an active learning framework. The idea also touches on 'High-throughput data generation methods' as it mentions high-throughput screening experiments for validation. The only minor limitation is that while it implies wet lab results would be generated, it doesn't explicitly detail the specific biological experiments that would be conducted."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (costly biomolecular design experiments), proposes a specific solution (GP-based active learning system), and outlines the expected outcomes (reduction in experimental iterations and discovery of novel biomolecules). The methodology is described with sufficient detail, mentioning the use of Gaussian Processes, uncertainty-based selection, and specialized kernel functions. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific biomolecular properties that would be incorporated into the kernel functions and more details on how the graph neural networks would be integrated with the GP framework. The experimental validation process is mentioned but not extensively detailed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by proposing an integrated framework that combines active learning with biomolecular design. While active learning and Gaussian Processes are established techniques, their application to guide experimental design in biomolecular optimization represents a fresh approach. The integration of graph neural networks for representation learning within the GP framework adds an innovative element. However, active learning for experimental design has been explored in some domains before, and Gaussian Processes have been used in biological contexts. The novelty lies more in the specific application and integration of these methods rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithms or approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed research is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Gaussian Processes and active learning are well-established techniques with available implementations. The integration with high-throughput screening is practical as these experimental platforms exist in many research settings. The approach is modular, allowing for incremental development and testing. The main implementation challenges would likely be in developing effective kernel functions for biomolecular data and ensuring efficient computation for potentially large datasets. The iterative nature of the approach also means that partial results can be obtained even if the full optimization is not achieved. The research would require access to wet lab facilities for validation, but this is standard for the field targeted by the workshop."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical challenge in biomolecular design: the high cost and time investment of experimental validation. By creating a framework that minimizes experimental iterations while maximizing discovery efficiency, it could substantially accelerate progress in protein engineering, drug discovery, and enzyme optimization. The potential impact extends across multiple fields including medicine, industrial biotechnology, and environmental applications. The approach directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging the gap between computational models and experimental biology. If successful, this work could establish a new paradigm for how ML-guided experiments are conducted in biomolecular engineering, potentially leading to significant cost savings and faster discovery of novel biomolecules with desired properties."
