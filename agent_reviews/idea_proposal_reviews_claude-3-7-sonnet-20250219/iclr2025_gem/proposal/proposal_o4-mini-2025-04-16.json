    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GEM workshop's goal of bridging computational and experimental perspectives in biomolecular design, specifically focusing on antibody affinity maturation. The proposal incorporates both the ML track (generative models for biomolecular design) and biology track (experimental validation with wet lab results) aspects mentioned in the task description. The core methodology of integrating generative models with active learning for experimental guidance perfectly matches the initial research idea. The proposal also thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing similar approaches like CloneBO and active learning frameworks while extending beyond them with a more comprehensive closed-loop system. The mathematical formulation, experimental design, and evaluation metrics are all consistent with current research directions identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research framework is presented in a logical flow from data collection through model design to experimental validation. The mathematical formulations are precisely defined, including the generative model objective, predictive model design, and acquisition function. The IGAL algorithm is presented step-by-step with clear inputs, processes, and outputs. The hyperparameters and implementation details are explicitly stated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for uncertainty estimation in the predictive model could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the weight function w(y_i) in the generative model and the overall optimization objective could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical details about the wet-lab protocols could be more specific. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity is strong."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing approaches into a cohesive closed-loop framework. While individual components (generative models, active learning, and affinity prediction) have been explored in the literature (as seen in papers like CloneBO and AffinityFlow), the IGAL framework offers a fresh perspective by tightly coupling these elements into an iterative system with bidirectional feedback between computational predictions and experimental validation. The weighted fine-tuning objective for the generative model that emphasizes high-affinity examples is a clever innovation. The proposal's novelty lies more in the integration and implementation approach rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or models. The UCB-inspired acquisition function is adapted from existing work rather than being entirely novel. While not groundbreaking in terms of theoretical innovation, the proposal offers a valuable new combination of techniques with potential practical impact."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The mathematical formulations for the generative model, predictive model, and acquisition function are rigorous and theoretically grounded. The use of upper confidence bounds for active learning is well-established in the literature and appropriately applied here. The proposal shows awareness of important technical considerations such as uncertainty estimation, normalization of binding affinities, and appropriate model architectures. The experimental design includes proper controls and statistical analysis. The hyperparameter choices are reasonable and explicitly stated. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and appropriate for the task. One minor limitation is that the proposal could more thoroughly address potential failure modes or edge cases in the active learning loop, such as model misspecification or experimental noise. Additionally, while the proposal mentions using Monte Carlo dropout or deep ensembles for uncertainty estimation, it doesn't fully justify this choice over other Bayesian approaches. Overall, the technical foundations are solid and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with realistic resource requirements and implementation plans. The computational components rely on established models (ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF) and standard deep learning techniques, making them implementable with current technology. The experimental aspects utilize standard techniques in antibody engineering (yeast display, SPR) that are widely available in academic and industry labs. The iterative process with 5 rounds of 50 samples each (250 total measurements) is reasonable for a research project. The hardware requirements (A100 GPUs) are accessible at many institutions. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the timeline for completing 5 rounds of wet-lab experiments, including protein expression, purification, and binding measurements, could be challenging; (2) the proposal assumes that the initial dataset of ~5,000 sequences with measured affinities will be sufficient for training effective models; (3) the integration of computational and experimental workflows requires careful coordination that might face practical challenges. While ambitious, these challenges appear manageable with proper planning and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in therapeutic antibody development with potential for substantial impact. Affinity maturation is a critical bottleneck in antibody engineering, and reducing the experimental burden could accelerate development timelines and reduce costs significantly. The anticipated 10-fold improvement in binding affinity using only 250 wet-lab measurements would represent a meaningful advance over current approaches. The 50% reduction in experimental budget compared to random or purely generative approaches would have real economic impact in pharmaceutical R&D. The framework's extensibility to other biomolecular design problems (enzymes, peptides, etc.) increases its potential significance. The commitment to open-source release of code, models, and data enhances the proposal's impact on the research community. While the immediate application is focused on antibody affinity maturation rather than solving entirely new classes of problems, the efficiency gains and methodological advances could substantially influence how computational and experimental approaches are integrated in biomolecular engineering more broadly."
