    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the disconnect between generative ML and experimental biology highlighted in the workshop description by creating a closed-loop system that integrates computational predictions with experimental validation. The proposal builds upon the core idea of combining generative models with active learning for antibody affinity maturation, and extensively references concepts from the literature review such as Bayesian optimization, energy-based methods, and diffusion models. The methodology section thoroughly details how generative models (both sequence-based and structure-aware) will be integrated with active learning strategies to guide experimental testing, which is precisely what was outlined in the research idea. The proposal also incorporates specific acquisition functions and experimental validation approaches that are consistent with the papers mentioned in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The technical aspects are explained with appropriate mathematical formulations that enhance understanding without overwhelming the reader. The iterative optimization protocol is particularly well-defined, with clear steps from initial model training through experimental testing to model updating. The proposal also clearly delineates the computational and experimental components of the research. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as more specific details on how the different acquisition functions will be compared and evaluated, and clearer criteria for determining when to terminate the iterative process. Additionally, while the proposal mentions several generative models (ESM-2, IgDiff), it could more explicitly state which specific model architectures will be implemented or compared."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating multiple cutting-edge approaches into a cohesive framework. The combination of dual-track generative modeling (sequence-based and structure-aware), multiple acquisition functions for active learning, and a closed-loop experimental validation system represents a fresh approach to antibody design. The proposal builds upon existing methods mentioned in the literature review but extends them by creating a comprehensive system that bridges computational and experimental aspects. However, while the individual components (generative models, active learning, affinity prediction) are not entirely new, the integration and application to antibody affinity maturation in a closed-loop system provides a novel perspective. The proposal could have scored higher if it had introduced more groundbreaking methodological innovations rather than primarily combining existing approaches in a new way."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for both the generative models and affinity prediction models are well-defined and grounded in established principles. The active learning framework is thoroughly described with multiple acquisition functions that are mathematically sound. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate controls and evaluation metrics. The proposal also acknowledges the challenges in the field and addresses them through its methodology. The integration of sequence-based and structure-based approaches is well-justified given the complex nature of antibody-antigen interactions. However, there are some areas where additional rigor could be beneficial, such as more detailed discussion of potential biases in the training data and how these might be mitigated, or more specific statistical methods for evaluating the significance of affinity improvements. Additionally, while the proposal mentions updating both generative and predictive models, it could provide more detail on the specific updating mechanisms to ensure stability across iterations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with existing technology and methods, though it will require significant resources and expertise to implement successfully. The computational components (generative models, affinity prediction, active learning) are all implementable with current machine learning frameworks and computational resources. The experimental validation methods (antibody expression, affinity measurement) are standard techniques in molecular biology laboratories. The proposal also provides a realistic timeline (2-3 weeks per cycle) and acknowledges the need for high-performance computing infrastructure. However, there are some challenges that may affect feasibility: 1) The integration of multiple complex components (sequence-based generation, structure-aware generation, affinity prediction, active learning) into a seamless pipeline is technically challenging; 2) The proposal requires access to specialized equipment and expertise across both computational and experimental domains; 3) The iterative nature of the approach means that delays in any component could significantly impact the overall timeline; 4) The proposal assumes that the affinity prediction models will be accurate enough to guide the selection process effectively, which may not be the case initially."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in therapeutic antibody development with potential for significant impact. Improving the efficiency of antibody affinity maturation could accelerate the development of new therapeutics for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases, directly benefiting patients. The approach also directly addresses the gap between computational methods and experimental biology highlighted in the workshop description, potentially establishing a new paradigm for biomolecular design. The methodological advances could be extended beyond antibodies to other protein engineering applications. The proposal clearly articulates both the immediate expected outcomes (improved antibody variants, optimized computational pipeline) and the broader impact on the field. However, while the potential impact is substantial, it is somewhat constrained by the focus on antibody affinity maturation specifically, rather than addressing a broader range of biomolecular design challenges. Additionally, the proposal could more explicitly discuss how the approach might be scaled or adapted to different types of targets or therapeutic modalities."
