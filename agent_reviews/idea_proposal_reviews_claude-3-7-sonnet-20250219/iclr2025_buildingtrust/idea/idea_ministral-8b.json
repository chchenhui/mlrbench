        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on trustworthiness of LLMs, particularly emphasizing explainability and interpretability (point 3 in the workshop scope). The proposal also touches on improving reliability and truthfulness (point 2) and indirectly contributes to evaluation metrics (point 1). The methodology includes user studies which align with the workshop's emphasis on use-centric systems. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some other workshop topics like robustness, unlearning, or guardrails, though its framework could potentially incorporate these aspects."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, methodology, expected outcomes, and potential impact. The four-step methodology provides a good overview of the approach. However, there are some ambiguities that could be clarified: (1) The specific baseline LLM to be used is not specified; (2) The exact implementation details of how XAI techniques will be integrated with LLMs need elaboration; (3) The evaluation process could be more detailed, particularly how the metrics will quantify trustworthiness; and (4) The framework structure itself is mentioned but not fully described. These points prevent the idea from receiving a higher clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea combines existing XAI techniques (LIME, SHAP, attention mechanisms) with LLMs, which shows some originality in application. The focus on trustworthiness through explainability is timely and relevant. However, these XAI techniques have been applied to language models before, and the proposal doesn't clearly articulate what novel technical contributions it will make beyond applying existing methods. The user interaction component adds some freshness, but the overall approach follows established patterns in the XAI field. The research doesn't propose fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical frameworks, instead focusing on applying and evaluating existing techniques in a specific context."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. The XAI techniques mentioned (LIME, SHAP, attention mechanisms) are well-established and have existing implementations. The evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) are standard in NLP. User studies, while requiring careful design, are common practice. The main implementation challenges would likely come from effectively integrating these techniques with modern LLMs at scale and designing meaningful user studies that accurately measure trust. The proposal doesn't require developing fundamentally new algorithms or technologies, making it practical to implement with existing resources and expertise in the field."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical problem in AI today: the lack of transparency and explainability in LLMs, which directly impacts trust. As LLMs become more prevalent in high-stakes applications, the ability to explain their outputs becomes increasingly important for user acceptance, regulatory compliance, and ethical deployment. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications across industries. The research could lead to meaningful contributions in how we deploy LLMs responsibly. The significance is somewhat limited by the fact that explainability alone doesn't solve all trustworthiness issues (such as hallucinations or bias), but it represents an important component of the broader trustworthiness challenge."
