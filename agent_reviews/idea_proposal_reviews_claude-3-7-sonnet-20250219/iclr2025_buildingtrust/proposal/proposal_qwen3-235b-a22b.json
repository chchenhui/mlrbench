        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Error detection and correction' and 'Improving reliability and truthfulness of LLMs' by developing a Self-Correcting Language Model framework. The proposal comprehensively incorporates the core concept from the research idea of using internal confidence scoring and retrieval-augmented correction. It also thoroughly addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, including error detection accuracy, computational overhead, dependence on external resources, and generalization across domains. The proposal references all four papers from the literature review and builds upon their limitations to propose a more comprehensive solution."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design, including datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly explained. The only minor areas that could benefit from further clarification are: (1) more details on how the weights w_{l,h} for attention heads would be determined, and (2) additional specifics on the fine-tuning process for the base LLM. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible and provides sufficient detail for understanding the research plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several innovative elements. The use of self-attention entropy for uncertainty quantification is a fresh approach to error detection that leverages the model's internal representations. The integration of this confidence scoring with retrieval-augmented correction in an iterative loop represents a novel framework that addresses limitations in existing approaches. However, while the individual components (attention analysis, retrieval augmentation) have been explored separately in prior work, the proposal's main innovation lies in their combination and application to self-correction rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques. The approach builds incrementally on existing methods like SuperCorrect, ISC, and STaSC mentioned in the literature review, offering improvements rather than a revolutionary paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for self-attention entropy and confidence scoring are well-defined and theoretically grounded. The methodology for span-level filtering and retrieval-augmented rewriting is logically sound and builds on established techniques in information retrieval (BM25, DPR). The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate benchmarks (TruthfulQA, FEVER), baselines, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components. The only minor concerns are: (1) the assumption that attention entropy correlates with uncertainty could benefit from more theoretical justification, and (2) the proposal could elaborate more on how the confidence threshold τ_c would be calibrated. Overall, the technical approach is robust and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible research plan with realistic implementation details. The use of Falcon-40B as the base model and NVIDIA DGX A100 for training indicates appropriate resource planning. The methodology leverages existing techniques (BM25, DPR) and datasets (TruthfulQA, FEVER), which increases practicality. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) the computational requirements for running multiple correction loops with a 40B parameter model could be substantial, potentially limiting real-time applications; (2) curating high-quality knowledge bases for domain-specific tasks (medicine, law) may require significant effort; and (3) the proposed 40% reduction in hallucinations compared to GPT-4 is ambitious and may be difficult to achieve consistently across domains. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is implementable with current technology and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in LLM deployment—hallucinations and factual errors—that directly impacts trustworthiness in high-stakes domains. The potential impact is substantial, with expected outcomes including a 40% reduction in hallucinations on TruthfulQA and 50% reduction in medical misinformation. These improvements would significantly enhance the applicability of LLMs in healthcare, legal, and other critical sectors where accuracy is paramount. The open-source toolkit deliverable would benefit the broader research community, enabling others to build upon this work. The proposal also aligns well with emerging regulatory frameworks for AI trustworthiness. While the immediate impact may be strongest in specific domains (healthcare, legal), the framework's potential to transform LLMs into self-regulating systems has far-reaching implications for AI safety and reliability more broadly."
