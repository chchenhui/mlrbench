    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Error detection and correction' and 'Improving reliability and truthfulness of LLMs' by developing a self-supervised framework for automated error detection and correction. The proposal expands on the core idea of combining an internal confidence scorer with a retrieval-augmented corrector, providing detailed technical specifications for both components. It also builds upon the literature review by acknowledging existing work like SuperCorrect and Intrinsic Self-Correction while addressing key challenges identified in the review, such as computational overhead and error detection accuracy. The methodology section thoroughly explains how the proposed approach will work, consistent with the initial research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical components are explained in detail with mathematical formulations that are precise and understandable. The three main components of the methodology (confidence scoring, retrieval-augmented correction, and iterative refinement) are clearly delineated with subsections that explain each aspect thoroughly. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are comprehensively outlined. The only minor areas that could benefit from additional clarity are: (1) some technical details about how the retrieval system would be implemented in practice, and (2) more specific information about how the weighting parameters in the confidence score aggregation would be learned. Overall, however, the proposal is highly readable and well-structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several innovative components into a cohesive framework. The internal confidence scoring mechanism that leverages self-attention patterns, token-level probability analysis, and contrastive decoding signals represents a novel approach to error detection. The combination of this with a retrieval-augmented correction system in an iterative refinement process is also innovative. However, as acknowledged in the literature review, several existing approaches like SuperCorrect and Intrinsic Self-Correction already address self-correction in LLMs. While this proposal builds upon these approaches and offers new technical contributions (particularly in the confidence scoring mechanism), it represents an evolution rather than a revolutionary breakthrough in the field. The integration of multiple signals for confidence scoring and the iterative refinement process are the most novel aspects of the proposal."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for confidence scoring are well-defined and grounded in established concepts from attention mechanisms and probability theory. The retrieval-augmented correction system builds on proven techniques in information retrieval and knowledge integration. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate datasets, baseline comparisons, and ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component. The evaluation metrics are well-chosen to assess both technical performance and real-world utility. The only minor concerns about soundness relate to: (1) potential challenges in tuning the weighting parameters for confidence score aggregation, and (2) the assumption that retrieved knowledge will always be reliable enough for correction. Overall, however, the methodology is robust and well-justified with appropriate technical depth."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it will require significant engineering effort to implement successfully. The confidence scoring mechanism relies on model internals that are accessible in most modern LLM architectures. The retrieval-augmented correction system builds on established retrieval techniques. The datasets proposed for evaluation are publicly available. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) the computational overhead of running multiple iterations of correction, especially for long texts; (2) the need for high-quality knowledge sources across diverse domains; (3) the complexity of training the weighting parameters for confidence score aggregation; and (4) potential latency issues in real-time applications. The proposal acknowledges these challenges in the limitations section and proposes reasonable approaches to address them, suggesting the authors have a realistic understanding of the implementation challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI trustworthiness that has significant implications across multiple domains. Hallucinations in LLMs represent one of the most pressing challenges for deploying these models in high-stakes environments like healthcare, legal advice, and financial services. By enabling models to detect and correct their own errors, this research could substantially improve the reliability of AI systems without sacrificing their accessibility or usability. The expected reduction in hallucination rates by 30-50% across general knowledge domains and up to 70% in specialized domains would represent a major advancement in LLM trustworthiness. The approach also has the potential to reduce reliance on human oversight, making reliable AI more accessible to organizations with limited resources. The broader impact section convincingly articulates how this work contributes to a paradigm shift toward self-improving AI systems, which has far-reaching implications for the field."
