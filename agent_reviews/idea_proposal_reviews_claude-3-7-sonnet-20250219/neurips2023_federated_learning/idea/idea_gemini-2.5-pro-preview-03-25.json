        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The FedPrompt idea aligns excellently with the task description, addressing the intersection of federated learning and foundation models. It directly tackles the challenges mentioned in the task: resource constraints, privacy preservation, and efficient adaptation of foundation models in federated settings. The proposal specifically addresses 'prompt tuning in federated settings' and 'resource-efficient FL with foundation models,' which are explicitly listed topics. It also touches on personalization and adaptive aggregation strategies, which are other mentioned topics. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some other aspects like fairness or security considerations, but these weren't mandatory requirements."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation, main approach, and expected outcomes are all well-articulated. The concept of federating prompt tuning rather than full model fine-tuning is explained concisely and logically. The workflow (clients download frozen model once, train prompts locally, communicate only prompt parameters) is clearly laid out. However, there are some minor ambiguities: the specific adaptive aggregation strategies aren't detailed, and the exact mechanism for handling heterogeneity across clients could be more precisely defined. The proposal would benefit from slightly more technical specificity about the prompt tuning approach being used."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "FedPrompt presents a novel combination of two cutting-edge approaches: federated learning and prompt tuning for foundation models. While both federated learning and prompt tuning exist separately, their integration in this specific manner appears innovative. The focus on prompt-only parameter sharing in FL settings is particularly novel, as most federated approaches still focus on sharing larger portions of model parameters. The adaptive aggregation strategies for prompts tailored to data heterogeneity also suggest innovation beyond simply combining the two techniques. However, the core techniques being combined (FL and prompt tuning) are established, which prevents this from receiving the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible with current technology. Prompt tuning is already an established technique for foundation models, and federated learning frameworks exist. The communication efficiency gained by only sharing prompt parameters (typically a tiny fraction of the full model size) makes this approach particularly practical for real-world deployment. The one-time download of the foundation model is a reasonable assumption given modern edge devices' capabilities. The computational requirements for clients are manageable since they're only tuning small prompt vectors rather than large model components. Implementation would require careful engineering but doesn't require any technological breakthroughs or unrealistic resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical challenge in deploying foundation models in privacy-sensitive, resource-constrained environments. If successful, it could dramatically reduce the barriers to utilizing powerful foundation models on edge devices while preserving privacy. The significance is high because: 1) it tackles the growing tension between model size and device capabilities, 2) it preserves privacy while enabling personalization, 3) it could make foundation models accessible to a much wider range of applications and devices, and 4) the communication efficiency gains could be orders of magnitude compared to traditional FL approaches. The potential impact spans multiple domains where both privacy and computational efficiency are concerns."
