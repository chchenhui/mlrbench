    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of adapting foundation models in federated settings while preserving privacy and reducing computational overhead, which is central to the task description. The proposal incorporates the core concept from the research idea of using prompt tuning as a lightweight alternative to full model fine-tuning in FL settings. It builds upon the literature review by extending approaches like FedBPT and FedDTPT with a novel dynamic aggregation mechanism and exploring multiple prompt parameterization techniques. The proposal comprehensively covers the key challenges identified in the literature review: data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, privacy preservation, and computational constraints. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions model accessibility as a challenge, the proposal doesn't explicitly address black-box scenarios throughout, though it does reference them."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. Research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described with sufficient detail, including mathematical formulations for the dynamic aggregation mechanism. The prompt parameterization techniques (Prefix Tuning, LoRA, Discrete Prompt Optimization) are well-defined, and the experimental design includes specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the three prompt parameterization techniques could be more explicitly compared, (2) The exact implementation details of the secure multi-party computation protocol are somewhat vague, and (3) The proposal could more clearly articulate how the dynamic weighting mechanism (φ_i) is calculated beyond mentioning 'local validation accuracy and class diversity'. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by combining several innovative elements. The dynamic aggregation mechanism that weights client contributions based on data quality and diversity represents a novel approach to addressing non-IID data in federated prompt tuning. The exploration of multiple prompt parameterization techniques (Prefix Tuning, LoRA, and Discrete Prompt Optimization) within a unified federated framework is also innovative. However, the core components build upon existing work rather than introducing entirely new concepts - federated prompt tuning has been explored in works like FedBPT and FedDTPT, and the prompt parameterization techniques themselves are adapted from prior work. The integration of differential privacy with prompt tuning in FL settings is valuable but not groundbreaking. The proposal extends and combines existing approaches in meaningful ways rather than introducing fundamentally new paradigms, placing it in the 'good' rather than 'excellent' category for novelty."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The mathematical formulation of the dynamic aggregation mechanism is rigorous and properly accounts for client data heterogeneity. The three prompt parameterization techniques are well-established in the literature and appropriately selected for the federated setting. The privacy-preserving protocols (MPC and DP) are grounded in solid theoretical foundations, with appropriate references to established work like Dwork and Roth. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics that will enable thorough validation of the approach. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the impact of key components. The only minor weaknesses are: (1) The proposal doesn't fully elaborate on how the client data quality scores (φ_i) are computed, which is crucial for the dynamic weighting mechanism, and (2) The sensitivity analysis for the DP noise calibration could be more precisely defined. Overall, the technical approach is rigorous and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly feasible research plan with realistic objectives and implementation strategies. The prompt tuning approach significantly reduces computational and communication requirements compared to full model fine-tuning, making it practical for resource-constrained clients. The experimental design uses established datasets (GLUE, CIFAR-100) and builds on existing frameworks (FedAvg, FedBPT), which increases feasibility. The three prompt parameterization techniques provide flexibility to adapt to different resource constraints. The privacy-preserving mechanisms (MPC and DP) have well-established implementations available. The expected outcomes include realistic performance improvements (5-15% accuracy gains, 80-95% communication reduction) based on prior work. The main implementation challenges are: (1) Coordinating secure aggregation across heterogeneous clients may require additional infrastructure, (2) Calibrating DP noise to maintain utility while providing meaningful privacy guarantees requires careful tuning, and (3) The computational requirements for the server may still be substantial when dealing with many clients. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is well within the capabilities of current technology and methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge at the intersection of foundation models and federated learning, with far-reaching implications. By enabling efficient adaptation of foundation models in privacy-sensitive, distributed environments, this work could significantly impact domains like healthcare and finance where data cannot be centralized due to regulatory constraints. The communication efficiency gains (80-95% reduction) would make FL practical for resource-constrained environments, democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities. The privacy-preserving mechanisms ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, addressing a major barrier to adoption. The framework's adaptability to different prompt parameterization techniques makes it broadly applicable across various foundation model architectures. The societal impact is particularly noteworthy - enabling small institutions with sensitive data to participate in collaborative AI development without compromising privacy. The sustainability benefits through reduced communication costs align with green AI initiatives. The proposal addresses a timely challenge as foundation models become increasingly prevalent, making its potential impact especially significant."
