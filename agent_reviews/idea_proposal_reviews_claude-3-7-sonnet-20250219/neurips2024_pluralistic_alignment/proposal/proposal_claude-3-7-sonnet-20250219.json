        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on pluralistic AI alignment by developing a framework (MOVR) that captures diverse human values without imposing homogeneous ethical frameworks. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including vector-valued reinforcement learning, context-sensitive arbitration mechanisms, and interpretability tools. It thoroughly engages with the literature review, citing all ten papers appropriately and building upon their concepts (e.g., Davis and Brown's vector-valued RL, Taylor and Harris's context-sensitive arbitration, Martinez and Wilson's preference elicitation techniques). The methodology section clearly shows how these concepts are integrated into a coherent framework. The proposal also addresses the workshop topics comprehensively, covering philosophical aspects (value representation), machine learning methods (multi-objective optimization), HCI considerations (interpretability tools), and social science perspectives (consensus-building mechanisms)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The introduction effectively establishes the problem and motivation, while the methodology section provides detailed explanations of the technical approach with appropriate mathematical formulations. The four components of the MOVR framework are clearly delineated, and the experimental design is thoroughly described with specific datasets, evaluation metrics, and comparison baselines. The expected outcomes section logically follows from the proposed work. However, there are a few areas where clarity could be improved: (1) some mathematical notations could benefit from additional explanation, particularly for interdisciplinary audiences; (2) the relationship between the arbitration mechanisms and the learning objectives could be more explicitly connected; and (3) the transition between theoretical framework and practical implementation could be more detailed, especially regarding how the meta-network would be trained to select appropriate arbitration strategies."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to pluralistic AI alignment. The core innovation—maintaining distinct representation spaces for different value systems rather than collapsing them into a single utility function—represents a fresh perspective on the alignment problem. The context-sensitive arbitration mechanism that applies different resolution strategies based on context is a novel combination of existing techniques. The proposal builds upon established methods (vector-valued RL, multi-objective optimization) but extends them in new directions specifically for pluralistic alignment. However, while innovative, the approach is not entirely groundbreaking—it primarily combines and adapts existing techniques from the literature (e.g., Davis and Brown's vector-valued RL, Taylor and Harris's arbitration mechanisms) rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The novelty lies more in the application and integration of these techniques to address value pluralism than in the development of entirely new methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The mathematical framework for multi-dimensional value representation is well-formulated, with clear definitions of the value space, value functions, and learning objectives. The three-strategy arbitration mechanism (consensus-seeking, trade-off surfacing, and adaptive weighting) is theoretically sound and well-justified. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets, evaluation metrics, and comparison baselines that would effectively test the framework's capabilities. The proposal also acknowledges limitations and ethical considerations, demonstrating critical awareness of potential challenges. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) the mechanism for training the meta-network to select appropriate arbitration strategies could be more thoroughly explained; (2) the statistical validity of the proposed user studies could be more explicitly addressed; and (3) the potential interactions between the different loss terms in the learning objective could benefit from more detailed analysis."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that could be implemented with current technology and methods, though it would require significant resources and expertise. The technical components build on established methods in reinforcement learning and multi-objective optimization, making the core algorithms implementable. The data collection approach for preference elicitation is practical, using stratified sampling across demographic dimensions. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive and realistic. However, several aspects present implementation challenges: (1) collecting preference data from truly diverse demographic groups at scale would require substantial resources and coordination; (2) training the proposed architecture with multiple loss terms may present optimization difficulties; (3) the user studies involving 200 diverse participants would be logistically complex; and (4) ensuring that the arbitration mechanisms work effectively across diverse domains would require extensive testing and refinement. While these challenges are significant, they do not render the proposal infeasible—rather, they suggest that successful implementation would require careful planning, sufficient resources, and possibly some scope adjustments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI alignment with potentially far-reaching implications. As AI systems increasingly make consequential decisions affecting diverse populations, the ability to represent and reason about multiple value systems simultaneously is crucial for ethical and socially beneficial AI. The MOVR framework could significantly advance pluralistic AI alignment by providing a principled approach to handling value conflicts without imposing artificial consensus. The potential applications span critical domains including content moderation, healthcare, public policy, and education—areas where value conflicts are prevalent and consequential. Beyond technical contributions, the societal impact could be substantial: enhancing AI's cultural competence, promoting more inclusive technology development, supporting democratic governance of AI, and potentially offering new approaches to human-human value conflicts. The proposal directly addresses key challenges identified in the literature review and workshop description, particularly the need for methods that can handle annotation disagreements and integrate diverse perspectives into AI alignment. The significance is well-articulated and justified throughout the proposal."
