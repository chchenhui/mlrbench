    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'fact verification (e.g. hallucinated generation)' topic from the workshop description, focusing on improving LLM trustworthiness through proactive hallucination detection. The methodology follows the core idea of using contrastive learning to calibrate internal confidence scores with factual accuracy. The proposal incorporates insights from the literature review, particularly building upon works like InternalInspector and MIND that leverage internal states for hallucination detection. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are comprehensive and consistent with the research objectives."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are defined in a logical and coherent manner. The technical approach is explained with appropriate mathematical formulations for contrastive loss and confidence calculation. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-specified. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific internal states to be used could be more precisely defined, (2) the threshold determination process for flagging unreliable statements during inference could be elaborated, and (3) the exact implementation details of how the model will signal uncertainty during generation could be more explicit."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by focusing on proactive hallucination detection during generation rather than post-hoc verification. While it builds upon existing work in internal state analysis and contrastive learning (as seen in papers like InternalInspector and MIND), it introduces a novel integration of these approaches specifically for real-time hallucination signaling. The idea of having LLMs preface uncertain statements with markers during generation is innovative. However, the core technical components (contrastive learning, internal state analysis) are extensions of existing methods rather than fundamentally new approaches, which somewhat limits the novelty. The proposal could be more explicit about how it advances beyond the methods described in the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The contrastive learning approach is well-justified and mathematically formulated. The use of internal states for confidence calibration is supported by recent literature. The experimental design includes appropriate benchmarks and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. The methodology follows a logical progression from data collection to model training and evaluation. The technical formulations for contrastive loss and confidence calculation are correct. However, there could be more discussion about potential limitations of the approach, such as how to handle cases where the model is confidently wrong or how the approach might perform across different model architectures and sizes."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The contrastive learning approach and internal state analysis are implementable with existing LLM architectures. The data collection strategy is practical, involving both factual statements and generated hallucinations. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) extracting and analyzing internal states across different LLM architectures may require significant engineering effort, (2) creating a balanced and comprehensive dataset of factual and hallucinated statements across diverse domains is resource-intensive, (3) integrating the confidence calibration mechanism into the generation process without significantly impacting inference speed could be challenging, and (4) the computational resources required for training and fine-tuning large models with contrastive learning might be substantial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in LLM deployment - hallucination detection and mitigation - which is essential for building trustworthy AI systems. The impact potential is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) it could significantly improve user trust in LLM outputs by providing real-time confidence indicators, (2) it addresses a fundamental limitation of current LLMs that restricts their use in high-stakes applications, (3) the approach could be applied across various domains and use cases, from healthcare to education to information retrieval, and (4) it aligns with growing regulatory and ethical concerns about AI truthfulness and reliability. The proactive nature of the approach (detecting hallucinations during generation rather than after) represents a meaningful advancement over current reactive methods."
