    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'fact verification (e.g. hallucinated generation)' topic from the workshop description by developing a proactive hallucination detection system. The proposal builds upon the core idea of using internal confidence calibration through contrastive learning, as outlined in the research idea. It thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, specifically citing and building upon works like InternalInspector, MIND, and PRISM for internal state analysis, and leveraging contrastive learning approaches mentioned in multiple papers. The methodology addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, including calibration of internal confidence metrics, real-time detection efficiency, and generalization across domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described in detail with mathematical formulations. The methodology section provides a comprehensive breakdown of the four main components: dataset creation, internal state extraction, contrastive fine-tuning, and inference-time hallucination detection. The experimental design is thoroughly outlined with specific metrics and baselines. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact relationship between the confidence encoder and the base LLM architecture could be more explicitly defined, (2) some technical details about how the internal states will be accessed without disrupting model performance could be elaborated, and (3) the adaptive thresholding mechanism could be more precisely formulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing approaches in a novel way. The core innovation lies in the integration of internal state analysis with contrastive learning specifically for hallucination detection during generation. While individual components like internal state analysis (from InternalInspector and MIND) and contrastive learning (from papers by Li et al. and others) exist in the literature, their combination for proactive hallucination detection represents a fresh approach. The sliding window aggregation for token-level confidence scoring and the adaptive thresholding mechanism are also innovative contributions. However, the proposal builds heavily on existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques, and the contrastive learning approach for confidence calibration has precedents in the cited literature, which somewhat limits its novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The mathematical formulations for confidence metrics, contrastive loss, and calibration loss are technically correct and appropriate for the task. The approach builds on established techniques from the literature, including contrastive learning and internal state analysis, providing a solid theoretical foundation. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate metrics, baselines, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes strategies to address them, such as the adaptive batch construction and dynamic thresholding. The dataset creation process is well-thought-out, incorporating multiple sources of factual and hallucinated content. One minor limitation is that the proposal could provide more details on how the confidence encoder will be integrated with different LLM architectures without affecting their performance."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The approach leverages existing techniques and builds upon established research, making implementation more straightforward. The dataset creation strategy is practical, using a combination of existing datasets and generated content. The internal state extraction methods have precedents in the literature (InternalInspector, MIND), suggesting their technical feasibility. The experimental design is comprehensive but achievable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) extracting and processing internal states from large models in real-time may introduce significant computational overhead, potentially affecting inference speed; (2) creating a high-quality dataset with verified hallucinations across diverse domains will require substantial resources; (3) the adaptive thresholding mechanism may be challenging to implement effectively across different contexts; and (4) ensuring the approach generalizes across different model architectures and sizes could be difficult. These challenges are acknowledged but would benefit from more detailed mitigation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in LLM deployment: hallucination detection and mitigation. This research has high significance for several reasons: (1) It directly tackles one of the most pressing challenges in trustworthy AI, as identified in the workshop description; (2) The proactive approach to hallucination detection could significantly improve the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes applications; (3) The expected outcomes include both technical advancements and practical tools that could be widely adopted; (4) The approach could enable new applications of LLMs in domains where factual accuracy is paramount, such as education, healthcare, and legal contexts; (5) The insights gained could inform future model development to reduce hallucination tendencies from the outset. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and connects them to broader goals of secure and trustworthy AI systems. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's focus on democratizing access to reliable AI systems through techniques that work with various model architectures."
