        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'fact verification (e.g. hallucinated generation)' topic from the workshop description by focusing on proactive hallucination detection in LLMs. The proposal faithfully expands on the initial idea of using internal confidence calibration through contrastive learning, maintaining the core concept while elaborating on implementation details. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with explicit references to works like InternalInspector, MIND, and PRISM, and the proposal addresses key challenges identified in the literature review such as calibration issues, domain generalization, and real-time detection efficiency. The methodology sections clearly build upon the approaches mentioned in the literature, particularly contrastive learning techniques and internal state analysis."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized, with a clear progression from background to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical aspects, including the mathematical formulations of contrastive loss and entropy-based uncertainty thresholding, are precisely defined and explained. The experimental design clearly outlines benchmarks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: the specific internal states to be used for confidence calibration could be more precisely defined, and the exact mechanism for dynamically adjusting the threshold parameter Î¸ during training could be further elaborated. Additionally, while the proposal mentions both synthetic and real-world datasets, the balance between these and specific preprocessing steps could be more detailed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing approaches in a novel way. The integration of contrastive learning with internal confidence calibration specifically for hallucination detection represents a fresh perspective. The proposal innovates by focusing on proactive, real-time detection rather than post-hoc verification, which distinguishes it from many existing approaches. The dynamic threshold mechanism for flagging potentially unreliable statements during generation is also innovative. However, the core techniques (contrastive learning, internal state analysis) build significantly on existing methods like InternalInspector and MIND. While the proposal creates a novel synthesis of these approaches and applies them to an important problem, it does not introduce fundamentally new algorithmic concepts. The approach is more evolutionary than revolutionary, building intelligently on established techniques rather than proposing entirely new paradigms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-defined mathematical formulations and methodological rigor. The contrastive learning approach is properly formalized with a clear loss function, and the uncertainty thresholding mechanism is mathematically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate benchmarks (HELM, AVeriTeC, TruthfulQA) and evaluation metrics (ECE, AUC-ROC) that align with the research objectives. The proposal is grounded in established theoretical frameworks from the literature and builds logically on prior work. The data collection strategy, combining synthetic generation with real-world datasets, is well-justified. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional rigor: the proposal could more explicitly address potential limitations of contrastive learning in this context, such as sensitivity to negative sampling strategies. Additionally, while the proposal mentions dynamic threshold adjustment, the specific algorithm for this adjustment is not fully detailed. Overall, the technical foundations are solid, with only minor gaps in the methodological details."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technologies and resources. The use of existing LLMs (LLaMA-3, GPT-4) and established benchmarks (HELM, AVeriTeC, TruthfulQA) makes the experimental setup practical. The contrastive learning approach has been successfully applied in similar contexts, suggesting its viability for this application. The data collection strategy, combining synthetic generation with existing datasets, is realistic and addresses the challenge of obtaining sufficient training data. However, there are some feasibility concerns: fine-tuning large models like GPT-4 may be computationally expensive and potentially inaccessible to many researchers. The proposal also requires creating paired factual/hallucinated statements at scale, which could be labor-intensive even with automated generation. Additionally, while the proposal aims to maintain inference efficiency, the real-time computation of internal confidence metrics might introduce latency that could impact practical applications. These challenges are significant but not insurmountable, making the overall approach feasible with appropriate resources and optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in LLM deployment: hallucination detection and trustworthiness. This issue is of paramount importance as LLMs are increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains such as healthcare, legal reasoning, and information retrieval. The potential impact is substantial, as improving real-time hallucination detection could significantly enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of LLM applications. The approach offers several advantages over existing methods: it operates proactively during generation rather than relying on post-hoc verification, it reduces dependence on external fact-checking tools, and it potentially generalizes across domains. The proposal directly addresses multiple topics from the workshop call, including reliability assurance, interpretability, and fact verification. If successful, this research could establish a new paradigm for building self-aware language models that can communicate uncertainty appropriately, which would be transformative for responsible AI deployment. The societal implications are significant, as more reliable LLMs would reduce the spread of misinformation and increase user trust in AI systems."
