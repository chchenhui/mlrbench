    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The DiffuNA proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the AI4NA workshop's focus on AI applications for nucleic acids, specifically targeting RNA therapeutic design through diffusion models. The proposal elaborates comprehensively on the brief idea, maintaining fidelity to the core concept of a 3D graph-based diffusion model for RNA design with reinforcement learning optimization. It thoroughly incorporates relevant literature, building upon works like RiboDiffusion, DiffSBDD, and other RNA structure prediction tools mentioned in the review. The methodology section demonstrates awareness of the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as the complexity of RNA folding and sequence-structure relationships. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions data scarcity as a challenge, the proposal doesn't explicitly address how it will overcome this limitation beyond mentioning data sources."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and conclusion. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The graph construction, diffusion process, and reinforcement learning components are explained thoroughly. The evaluation metrics and benchmarks are well-defined, making it clear how success will be measured. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact architecture of the GNN could be more precisely specified beyond mentioning SE(3)-Transformer as an example; (2) The proposal mentions a 'curriculum learning strategy' but doesn't elaborate on the specific curriculum; (3) While the proposal mentions data sources, it doesn't specify the exact size of the datasets or how potential data limitations will be addressed. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "DiffuNA presents significant novelty in several aspects. The integration of 3D graph-based diffusion models with reinforcement learning for RNA therapeutic design represents a novel approach not fully explored in the literature. While RiboDiffusion (2024) applies diffusion to RNA inverse folding, DiffuNA extends this by jointly optimizing sequence, structure, and binding affinity in a unified framework. The proposal's approach to representing RNA as 3D graphs with comprehensive node and edge features is innovative, as is the cross-modal attention mechanism connecting structural and sequence information. The reinforcement learning loop for optimizing therapeutic properties is particularly novel, as most existing methods focus on either structure prediction or sequence generation without this optimization component. However, some individual components build directly on existing techniques (e.g., SE(3)-Transformer, PPO algorithm), which slightly reduces the overall novelty score. Nevertheless, the combination and application of these techniques to RNA therapeutic design represents a fresh and innovative direction."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in most aspects. The diffusion model formulation is mathematically sound, with clear forward and reverse processes defined. The graph representation of RNA molecules is well-conceived, capturing both sequence and structural information. The reinforcement learning approach for optimization is theoretically justified with an appropriate reward function. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and relevant to the task. However, there are some areas where the technical soundness could be strengthened: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address how the model will handle the non-unique mapping between RNA sequences and structures; (2) While the proposal mentions using SHAPE reactivity data, it doesn't specify how this data will be incorporated into the model architecture; (3) The docking surrogate model for estimating binding affinity is mentioned but not thoroughly described; (4) The proposal lacks discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach. Despite these gaps, the overall technical approach is well-founded and builds appropriately on established methods in diffusion models, graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan, though with several significant challenges. On the positive side, the approach builds on existing techniques (diffusion models, GNNs, RL) that have proven successful in related domains. The data sources are identified, and the evaluation metrics are well-defined and measurable. However, several factors impact feasibility: (1) The integration of diffusion models with 3D graph representations and RL is complex and computationally intensive, potentially requiring substantial computational resources; (2) The data scarcity issue mentioned in the literature review is not adequately addressed, and high-quality RNA 3D structures with functional annotations are limited; (3) The proposal aims to achieve â‰¥80% sequence recovery on thrombin aptamers, significantly outperforming existing methods, which is ambitious; (4) The timeline for implementation is not specified, making it difficult to assess temporal feasibility; (5) Validating the generated RNA therapeutics would ideally require experimental testing, which is not discussed in the proposal. While the individual components have precedent in the literature, their integration and application to RNA therapeutic design at the proposed performance levels presents substantial implementation challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical need in RNA therapeutic development with potentially transformative impact. RNA therapeutics represent a rapidly growing field with applications in treating previously undruggable targets, and the current discovery process is indeed bottlenecked by laborious experimental screening. DiffuNA could dramatically accelerate this process, reducing lead generation time from months to days as claimed. The potential to discover novel RNA motifs with enhanced stability or affinity could expand the repertoire of RNA therapeutics. The proposal's aim to release open-source tools would democratize access to AI-driven RNA design, potentially catalyzing broader innovation in the field. The societal impact is substantial, as accelerated and improved RNA therapeutic design could address unmet medical needs in oncology, rare diseases, and infectious diseases. The technical contributions would also advance the state of the art in generative AI for biomolecular design. The proposal clearly articulates these impacts and provides specific metrics for success that would represent meaningful advances over current approaches. The significance is further enhanced by the timeliness of the work, given the growing interest in RNA therapeutics following the success of mRNA vaccines."
