        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the AI4NA workshop's focus on AI applications for nucleic acids, specifically targeting RNA therapeutic design through a novel diffusion model approach. The proposal faithfully expands on the core idea of DiffuNA as outlined in the research idea, maintaining the focus on joint learning of RNA sequence and structure, conditional generation based on binding pockets or scaffolds, and the RL-based refinement loop. The methodology thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing and building upon relevant works like RiboDiffusion [1] for RNA inverse folding, structure-based diffusion models like DiffSBDD [3], and RNA structure prediction tools [5-10]. The proposal addresses all five key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly focusing on the sequence-structure relationship (#3) and complexity of RNA folding (#2). The validation plan using thrombin-binding aptamers and hammerhead ribozymes directly matches what was proposed in the original idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. It provides a comprehensive introduction that establishes the background, problem statement, and proposed solution. The methodology section is particularly strong, with detailed explanations of the data collection process, model architecture, conditional generation approach, and RL refinement loop. The mathematical formulations of the diffusion process and loss functions are precisely defined. The experimental design and validation plan are thoroughly described with specific benchmarks and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact implementation details of the SE(3)-equivariant GNN could be more specific, (2) The transition between the diffusion model and the RL loop could be more explicitly defined, and (3) Some technical terms (e.g., SHAPE reactivity, G-quadruplex structures) are used without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with RNA biology. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. First, it introduces a novel application of 3D equivariant diffusion models to RNA design, extending approaches that have been successful in protein and small molecule design. Second, the joint modeling of RNA sequence, secondary structure, and tertiary structure in a single generative framework is innovative and addresses a gap in existing methods. Third, the integration of an RL-based refinement loop to optimize for functional properties is a creative approach not commonly seen in RNA design tools. The proposal builds upon existing work (e.g., RiboDiffusion [1], DiffSBDD [3]) but extends these approaches in non-trivial ways for RNA therapeutic design. While diffusion models themselves are not new, and equivariant GNNs have been applied to proteins and small molecules, their combination for RNA design with the specific graph representation and RL refinement represents a novel contribution to the field. The proposal could have scored higher if it had introduced more fundamentally new algorithmic innovations rather than novel combinations of existing techniques."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The diffusion model framework is well-established in the literature, and the adaptation to RNA graphs with SE(3)-equivariance is technically justified. The data preprocessing pipeline is comprehensive and appropriate for the task. The loss function formulation and training objective are mathematically coherent. However, there are some aspects that raise concerns about the technical rigor: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address how the model will handle the discrete nature of RNA sequences alongside continuous 3D coordinates in the diffusion process - the combination of continuous and discrete diffusion is non-trivial. (2) The RL refinement loop, while conceptually sound, lacks details on how the policy gradient will be efficiently computed given the high-dimensional action space of RNA generation. (3) The proposal acknowledges data scarcity as a challenge but doesn't provide a robust solution beyond using existing databases, which may be insufficient for training a complex model. (4) The validation metrics are appropriate, but there's limited discussion of statistical significance or how to handle potential biases in the evaluation. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is technically sound and follows established principles in machine learning and computational biology."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents several feasibility challenges that warrant a moderate score. On the positive side, the research leverages existing data sources (PDB, RNA STRAND) and builds upon established methodologies (diffusion models, GNNs, RL). The validation plan using known RNA structures is practical and achievable. However, significant challenges include: (1) Data limitations - the number of high-quality RNA 3D structures available is relatively small compared to proteins or small molecules, potentially limiting the model's ability to learn complex patterns. (2) Computational complexity - training 3D equivariant GNNs on graph structures with diffusion models is computationally intensive and may require substantial GPU resources. (3) The integration of continuous coordinate diffusion with discrete sequence features adds implementation complexity. (4) The RL refinement loop requires reliable surrogate models for RNA stability and binding affinity, which themselves are challenging research problems. (5) The timeline for completing all aspects of this ambitious project is not specified but would likely be substantial. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively suggest that the full implementation as described would be challenging and might require scope adjustments or significant computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in RNA therapeutic design with potentially far-reaching impact. RNA therapeutics represent a rapidly growing field in medicine, as evidenced by the success of mRNA vaccines and other RNA-based drugs. The current bottleneck in designing functional RNA molecules is precisely the challenge this research aims to solve. If successful, DiffuNA could dramatically accelerate the discovery of RNA therapeutics by reducing the need for extensive experimental screening, potentially saving years of development time and millions in research costs. The approach is comprehensive, addressing the full pipeline from sequence to structure to function prediction. Beyond the immediate application to therapeutics, the model could advance our fundamental understanding of RNA structure-function relationships and find applications in synthetic biology, diagnostics, and nanotechnology. The proposal aligns perfectly with the AI4NA workshop's goal of applying AI to nucleic acid research challenges. The open-source release of the model would further amplify its impact by enabling wider adoption in the research community. The significance is slightly tempered only by the inherent uncertainties in any drug discovery process - even with advanced computational tools, experimental validation remains essential."
