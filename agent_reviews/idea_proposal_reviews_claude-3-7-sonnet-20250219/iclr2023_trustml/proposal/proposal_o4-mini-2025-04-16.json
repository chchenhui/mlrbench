    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of balancing computational constraints and trustworthiness in ML systems, focusing specifically on fairness, robustness, and calibration. The methodology incorporates both theoretical analysis of trade-offs and practical algorithms for resource allocation, which matches the task's focus on understanding 'barriers to trustworthy ML and algorithms that overcome them.' The proposal cites and builds upon the literature review references appropriately, including works by Binkyte et al. (2025), Dehdashtian et al. (2024), and others mentioned in the review. The three-pronged approach (theoretical characterization, adaptive algorithms, and empirical validation) comprehensively addresses the research idea of analyzing trade-offs and developing adaptive algorithms for resource allocation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The problem formulation is precise, with well-defined mathematical notation for accuracy loss, fairness penalty, robustness penalty, and computational costs. The methodology section logically progresses from formal problem formulation to theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and experimental validation. The EfficientTrust algorithm is presented with pseudocode, making implementation details transparent. The expected outcomes are explicitly stated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the causal-informed scheduling section could provide more intuition about how the SCM works in practice, (2) some technical terms (e.g., 'sub-Gaussian gradients') might be challenging for non-specialists, and (3) the connection between the theoretical bounds and the practical algorithm could be more explicitly explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. First, it introduces a unified framework that quantitatively analyzes trade-offs between computational resources and multiple trust metrics, which according to the proposal has not been done before. Second, the causal-informed scheduling approach that dynamically allocates resources based on marginal gains is innovative. Third, the dynamic λ-update rule that adjusts regularization weights based on recent improvements per compute unit represents a novel approach to resource-aware training. The proposal builds upon existing work (cited appropriately) but extends it in meaningful ways. While individual components like fairness regularization and adaptive resource allocation have been explored separately (as noted in the literature review), their integration into a cohesive framework with theoretical guarantees and causal modeling represents a substantial advancement."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded. The mathematical formulation of the problem is rigorous, and the theoretical analysis builds on established techniques from information theory and optimization. The lower bounds on computational requirements for achieving fairness and robustness are presented with appropriate mathematical formalism. However, there are some potential concerns: (1) the proof sketch for Theorem 1 is quite brief, making it difficult to fully assess its validity; (2) the causal model assumptions for the scheduling algorithm could be more thoroughly justified; (3) the dynamic λ-update rule, while intuitive, might benefit from more theoretical analysis of its convergence properties. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering multiple datasets, resource regimes, baselines, and metrics, which strengthens the empirical soundness of the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps. The implementation is described as PyTorch-based with lightweight overhead (<2% extra compute), which is realistic. The experimental design covers a range of datasets and computational regimes, making it adaptable to different resource constraints. The use of existing metrics for fairness, robustness, and calibration is practical. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) fitting and updating causal models during training might introduce computational overhead that could be significant in very resource-constrained environments; (2) the proposal involves multiple complex components (SCM fitting, dynamic λ-updates, etc.) that might be challenging to integrate seamlessly; (3) the theoretical analysis might be mathematically intensive and time-consuming. Despite these challenges, the overall approach seems implementable with current technology and methods, especially given the detailed experimental protocol and evaluation metrics provided."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in responsible ML research with high potential impact. By enabling trustworthy ML in resource-constrained environments, it could democratize access to ethical AI capabilities for small clinics, NGOs, and edge-device applications. The theoretical contributions would advance our understanding of fundamental trade-offs between computation and trustworthiness, potentially influencing future research directions. The practical algorithms could lead to significant improvements in real-world deployments, with the proposal projecting up to 30% reduction in fairness gap and 20% increase in robust accuracy at fixed compute budgets. The open-source software package and practitioner's guide would further amplify the impact by making these advances accessible to the broader community. The work directly addresses the inequities in ML accessibility highlighted in the task description, making it highly significant for both scientific advancement and societal benefit."
