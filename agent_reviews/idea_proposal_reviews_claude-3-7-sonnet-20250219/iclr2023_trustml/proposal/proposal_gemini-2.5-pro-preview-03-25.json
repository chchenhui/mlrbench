        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of balancing computational constraints with trustworthiness in ML systems, focusing specifically on fairness and robustness as key trustworthiness dimensions. The methodology thoroughly incorporates the computational limitations mentioned in the task (hardware constraints, memory limitations, training/inference time constraints) and examines their impact on trustworthiness aspects. The proposal builds upon the literature review effectively, citing and extending concepts from papers like Johnson & Lee (2024) on adaptive resource allocation, Davis & Wilson (2025) on efficient fairness algorithms, and Binkyte et al. (2025) on causal understanding of trade-offs. The four-phase approach (empirical quantification, adaptive algorithm development, theoretical analysis, validation) comprehensively addresses the research idea of analyzing trade-offs and developing adaptive algorithms that prioritize compute allocation to trust-critical components."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and broken down into four specific goals. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the four phases, including specific datasets, metrics, and experimental designs. The mathematical formulation of the Adaptive Trustworthiness-Aware Training Scheduler (ATATS) is particularly well-defined, with clear equations showing how the dynamic weighting of different loss components works. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of the RL-based policy for ATATS could be more specific, (2) the theoretical analysis section is somewhat less detailed than other sections, and (3) some of the proposed metrics (e.g., for robustness evaluation) could be more precisely defined with equations as was done for fairness metrics."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers significant novelty in several aspects. The Adaptive Trustworthiness-Aware Training Scheduler (ATATS) represents a novel approach to dynamically allocate computational resources during training to optimize for multiple trustworthiness objectives simultaneously. This goes beyond existing work that typically focuses on static trade-offs or single dimensions of trustworthiness. The comprehensive empirical study examining how different types of computational constraints affect multiple dimensions of trustworthiness across diverse datasets is also innovative. The proposal extends current literature by investigating the interplay between computational constraints and multiple trustworthiness metrics simultaneously, rather than focusing on binary trade-offs (e.g., accuracy vs. fairness). While some individual components build on existing techniques (e.g., fairness metrics, adversarial training), their integration into a unified adaptive framework represents a novel contribution. The theoretical analysis of fundamental limits also promises to provide new insights into the relationship between computation and trustworthiness."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness overall. The methodology is well-grounded in established ML practices and builds upon existing literature in fairness, robustness, and computational efficiency. The mathematical formulation of the ATATS approach is technically sound, with clear loss functions and constraints. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, metrics, and baselines. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) The theoretical analysis section lacks specific mathematical frameworks or approaches for deriving the proposed bounds, (2) The connection between the empirical findings in Phase 1 and the design of ATATS in Phase 2 could be more explicitly formalized, (3) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address potential conflicts between different trustworthiness objectives (e.g., cases where improving fairness might reduce robustness), and (4) The validation metrics for the RL-based policy learning are not clearly specified. These limitations somewhat reduce the overall technical soundness, though the core approach remains well-founded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, but with some challenging aspects that may require careful management. The empirical quantification phase is highly feasible, using established datasets, metrics, and experimental designs. The development of rule-based heuristics for ATATS is also reasonably straightforward. However, several aspects present feasibility challenges: (1) The RL-based policy learning for ATATS may be computationally intensive and difficult to train effectively, especially given the high-dimensional state and action spaces, (2) The theoretical analysis of fundamental limits between computation and trustworthiness is ambitious and may be difficult to achieve comprehensively across different model classes and constraints, (3) The extensive validation across multiple datasets, models, and constraint types will require significant computational resources, which is somewhat ironic given the focus on computational efficiency. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed discussion of how these challenges will be addressed, including potential fallback strategies if certain approaches prove too difficult. Nevertheless, the phased approach allows for incremental progress even if some components prove more challenging than anticipated."

The tension between computational efficiency and trustworthiness is a critical challenge in deploying ML systems, particularly in resource-constrained environments and high-stakes applications. The expected outcomes would make several important contributions: (1) A comprehensive empirical understanding of how different computational constraints affect various trustworthiness dimensions, providing valuable insights for practitioners, (2) Novel adaptive algorithms that could enable more trustworthy ML in resource-constrained settings, potentially democratizing access to fair and robust AI systems, (3) Theoretical insights into fundamental trade-offs, advancing scientific understanding, (4) Practical guidelines that could directly influence industry practices.
