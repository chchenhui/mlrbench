    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, addressing the challenge of limited high-quality labeled data (a key statistical limitation mentioned in the task) and its impact on fairness (explicitly mentioned as a trustworthiness concern). The proposed active learning framework directly tackles the question of 'How does having less data affect the trustworthiness of ML algorithms?' and suggests a specific algorithmic technique (active learning with fairness-aware acquisition functions) to mitigate these problems. The idea also acknowledges potential trade-offs between model performance and fairness, which resonates with the task's interest in trade-offs between different aspects of trustworthiness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (data scarcity leading to fairness issues), the proposed solution (fairness-aware active learning), and the evaluation approach (using benchmark datasets). The concept of developing new acquisition functions that balance uncertainty, representativeness, and fairness criteria is well-defined. However, the idea could benefit from slightly more specificity about exactly how the fairness metrics will be incorporated into the acquisition function mathematically, and what specific fairness-accuracy trade-offs might be expected. Despite these minor points, the overall concept is well-articulated and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining active learning with fairness considerations in a data-scarce setting. While both active learning and fairness in ML are established research areas, their integration specifically to address data scarcity for underrepresented groups represents a fresh approach. The concept of developing acquisition functions that explicitly target fairness improvements is innovative. However, there have been some prior works exploring fairness in active learning, which slightly reduces the novelty score. The idea builds upon existing concepts rather than introducing an entirely new paradigm, but does so in a thoughtful way that addresses an important gap in current approaches."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Active learning is a well-established field with many existing frameworks that can be extended. The benchmark datasets mentioned (COMPAS, Adult) are publicly available and commonly used for fairness research. Developing and testing new acquisition functions that incorporate fairness metrics is technically straightforward for researchers with ML expertise. The evaluation methodology is clear and practical. The only minor challenges might be in balancing multiple competing objectives (accuracy, uncertainty reduction, and various fairness metrics) in the acquisition function design, but these are surmountable with careful experimental design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant problem at the intersection of two important challenges in ML: data scarcity and algorithmic fairness. The impact could be substantial for real-world applications where labeled data is expensive and fairness concerns are paramount (e.g., healthcare, criminal justice, lending). By proactively addressing fairness during the data acquisition phase rather than as a post-hoc correction, the approach could lead to more inherently fair models. The significance is enhanced by the practical reality that many organizations face limited labeling budgets while simultaneously needing to ensure fair outcomes. The research could influence how data collection strategies are designed across various high-stakes domains mentioned in the task description."
