    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The DP-Active proposal aligns excellently with the task description, addressing both statistical limitations (data scarcity, especially labeled data) and computational limitations (hardware constraints requiring lightweight models). It directly tackles multiple trustworthiness aspects mentioned in the task: privacy (through differential privacy), robustness to distribution shifts, and calibration under domain transfer. The proposal specifically targets resource-constrained environments like healthcare, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description as a sensitive domain. The approach of using active learning to overcome data limitations while maintaining privacy guarantees is precisely the kind of algorithmic technique the task is soliciting."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, proposed solution, and evaluation plan. The core components of DP-Active are explicitly defined: (1) privacy-cost estimation, (2) robustness optimization, and (3) lightweight architecture design. The methodology for sample selection and privacy budget allocation is explained concisely. The evaluation metrics (accuracy, calibration, privacy cost) and datasets are specified. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as the exact mechanism for quantifying 'robustness gains' and how the dynamic privacy budget allocation works across iterations. The proposal would benefit from more specificity about the lightweight CNN architecture and quantization approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty by integrating multiple research areas in a unique way. While active learning, differential privacy, and robustness have been studied separately, their joint optimization under computational constraints represents a fresh approach. The concept of dynamically allocating privacy budget based on sample utility is particularly innovative. The idea of explicitly modeling privacy-cost estimates during the active learning selection process appears to be a novel contribution. The approach isn't entirely unprecedented, as each component builds on existing work, but the combination and specific application to resource-constrained medical imaging creates a novel research direction that addresses gaps in current literature."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The individual components (active learning, differential privacy, lightweight models) are well-established with existing implementations. Medical imaging datasets like CheXpert are publicly available. However, several practical challenges exist: (1) balancing the competing objectives of privacy, robustness, and efficiency might require complex optimization; (2) implementing efficient gradient clipping while maintaining model performance could be technically challenging; (3) quantifying distribution shift robustness gains a priori is non-trivial; and (4) the computational overhead of privacy mechanisms might conflict with the resource constraints. These challenges are surmountable with careful engineering but will require significant effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical gap in trustworthy ML deployment for resource-constrained, privacy-sensitive domains. The significance is high because: (1) it tackles multiple real-world constraints simultaneously rather than in isolation; (2) healthcare and other sensitive domains urgently need privacy-preserving ML solutions that can work with limited data; (3) the approach could enable ML deployment in settings previously considered infeasible due to privacy or resource constraints; (4) the methodology could generalize beyond medical imaging to other sensitive domains; and (5) it directly addresses the trade-offs between different aspects of trustworthiness (privacy vs. accuracy vs. robustness) which is explicitly called for in the task description. The potential impact on enabling trustworthy ML in critical applications is substantial."
