        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, addressing the intersection of computational constraints and fairness in ML systems. It directly tackles the computational limitations mentioned in the task (particularly 'extreme constraints on computation time' and 'lack of high memory hardware') while focusing on fairness as a key aspect of trustworthy ML. The proposal specifically addresses how to maintain fairness guarantees under compute constraints, which is a central concern of the workshop. The idea also touches on certification of ML systems under limited resources, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, clearly articulating both the problem (fairness evaluation under compute constraints) and the proposed solution (adaptive subsampling with stratified mini-batches and variance reduction). The two-phase framework is well-defined, and the expected outcomes are quantified (5× reduction in evaluation time). The technical approach involving stratified sampling, control variates, and statistical guarantees is well-articulated. However, some minor details could be further elaborated, such as the specific fairness metrics being optimized beyond demographic parity and equality of opportunity, and how exactly the algorithm adjusts batch sizes dynamically."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining established statistical techniques (stratified sampling, control variates) in a novel way specifically for fairness estimation under compute constraints. The adaptive nature of the framework and its application to on-edge or low-power devices represents a fresh perspective on fairness evaluation. While the individual components (stratified sampling, variance reduction) are well-established statistical methods, their integration for fairness estimation with theoretical guarantees in resource-constrained environments appears to be a novel contribution. However, the approach builds upon existing fairness metrics and sampling techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and statistical methods. The proposed techniques (stratified sampling, control variates) are well-established in statistics and can be readily implemented. The approach doesn't require specialized hardware or unrealistic computational resources—in fact, it's specifically designed for resource-constrained environments. The theoretical analysis providing sample-complexity bounds suggests the authors have a solid mathematical foundation for the approach. The empirical evaluation on existing benchmarks indicates that implementation and testing are straightforward. The 5× reduction in evaluation time mentioned suggests preliminary results may already exist, further supporting feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses an important gap in trustworthy ML: how to maintain fairness guarantees in resource-constrained environments. As ML systems increasingly deploy to edge devices and low-power settings, this work could have substantial practical impact. The significance is heightened by the growing regulatory focus on algorithmic fairness and the need for efficient fairness monitoring in real-world applications. The theoretical contribution of establishing sample-complexity bounds for fairness estimation under compute constraints adds scientific value. The 5× reduction in evaluation time while maintaining fairness guarantees represents a meaningful improvement that could enable fairness-aware ML in previously infeasible settings. However, it focuses specifically on fairness rather than addressing multiple aspects of trustworthy ML simultaneously."
