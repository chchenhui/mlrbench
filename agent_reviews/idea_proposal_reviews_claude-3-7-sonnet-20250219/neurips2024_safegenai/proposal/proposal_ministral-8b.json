    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the vulnerability to adversarial attacks mentioned in the workshop topics by extending randomized smoothing to conditional generative models. The methodology follows the main idea closely, implementing the noisy variant sampling, model inference, output aggregation, and robustness certification as outlined. The proposal builds upon the literature review effectively, particularly drawing from papers on randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019) and its applications to GANs (Zhang et al., 2021). The focus on certified robustness for generative models directly contributes to the safe deployment of AI systems, which is central to the workshop's theme. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions challenges with computational overhead, the proposal doesn't thoroughly address strategies to mitigate this issue."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical sequence. The algorithmic steps are precisely defined with mathematical formulations that enhance understanding. The evaluation metrics are well-specified, covering both robustness certification and generation quality. The introduction effectively establishes the context and significance of the research. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for adaptive noise calibration could be more thoroughly explained with specific algorithms or formulations; (2) The relationship between the noise standard deviation and the certified robustness radius could be more explicitly defined; and (3) The proposal could provide more concrete examples of how SmoothGen would be applied to specific generative models (e.g., DALL-E, GPT, Stable Diffusion) to illustrate its practical implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by extending randomized smoothing from classification tasks to conditional generative models. This extension is non-trivial and addresses a significant gap in the current literature. The introduction of adaptive noise calibration strategies in latent space is an innovative approach to preserving generation quality while ensuring robustness. However, the core technique of randomized smoothing itself is not new, as evidenced by the literature review. The proposal builds upon existing work (particularly Zhang et al., 2021 on adversarial robustness of conditional GANs) rather than introducing a fundamentally new concept. While the application to high-dimensional generative tasks and the derivation of Wasserstein distance-based certificates represent meaningful advances, they are extensions of established techniques rather than groundbreaking innovations. The proposal could strengthen its novelty by more clearly articulating how its approach differs from or improves upon the existing work on randomized smoothing for GANs."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for noise sampling, model inference, output aggregation, and robustness certification are correctly presented and follow established principles in the field. The use of Wasserstein distance as a metric for bounding output distribution shifts is appropriate for generative models. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, incorporating both quantitative metrics for robustness (certified radius) and generation quality (IS, FID, BLEU, ROUGE). The proposal demonstrates a good understanding of the technical challenges involved in extending randomized smoothing to generative models. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from more rigorous treatment: (1) The theoretical guarantees for the Wasserstein bounds could be more thoroughly derived; (2) The statistical properties of the output aggregation method could be more rigorously analyzed; and (3) The proposal could provide more detailed analysis of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach, particularly for very high-dimensional generative tasks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technology and methods. The algorithmic steps are clearly defined and can be implemented using existing deep learning frameworks. The evaluation metrics are standard in the field and can be readily computed. The datasets mentioned (CIFAR-10, Penn Treebank) are publicly available and commonly used. However, there are several challenges that affect feasibility: (1) The computational overhead of sampling multiple noisy variants for each input condition could be substantial, especially for large generative models like diffusion models or LLMs; (2) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address how to efficiently implement adaptive noise calibration at scale; (3) The derivation of theoretical certificates for high-dimensional generative models may be mathematically complex and challenging; and (4) The trade-off between robustness and generation quality might be difficult to optimize in practice. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do represent significant hurdles that would require careful consideration and potentially substantial computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety with far-reaching implications. Providing certified robustness for generative models is essential for their safe deployment in sensitive domains like healthcare, legal systems, and security applications. The significance is particularly high given the rapid proliferation of generative AI systems and their increasing integration into critical infrastructure. The proposal's focus on provable guarantees rather than empirical robustness represents a significant advancement over current approaches. If successful, SmoothGen would be the first framework to provide certified adversarial protection for high-dimensional generative tasks, filling a major gap in the literature. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in industry and public policy, potentially influencing how generative AI systems are evaluated and regulated for safety. The alignment with growing concerns about AI safety and the need for trustworthy AI systems further enhances its significance in the current technological landscape."
