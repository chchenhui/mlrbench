    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the Safe Generative AI Workshop's concerns about vulnerability to adversarial attacks in generative models. The SmoothGen framework extends randomized smoothing to conditional generative models as outlined in the research idea, focusing on certified robustness against adversarial perturbations. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, building upon Cohen et al.'s (2019) randomized smoothing work, Zhang et al.'s (2021) application to conditional GANs, and other relevant papers. It addresses all the key challenges identified in the literature review, including extension to high-dimensional models, balancing robustness with generation quality, adaptive noise calibration, computational overhead, and theoretical guarantees. The methodology is comprehensive and well-aligned with both the task requirements and research objectives."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The mathematical formulation of SmoothGen is presented with precision, defining the smoothed generator and explaining the certification process. The algorithmic steps are laid out in a logical sequence, making the implementation approach easy to follow. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying models, datasets, perturbations, attacks, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) The exact mechanism for aggregating outputs from multiple noisy samples could be more precisely defined, especially for text generation; (2) The derivation of the Wasserstein distance bounds could be elaborated with more mathematical detail; and (3) The relationship between the noise level σ and the certified radius ε could be more explicitly formulated. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity of the proposal is strong."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. It extends randomized smoothing from classification to complex conditional generative models like diffusion models and LLMs, which represents a substantial advancement. The focus on bounding Wasserstein distances between output distributions rather than classification outcomes is an innovative approach to certification. The adaptive noise schedules and gradient-based noise calibration techniques for balancing robustness and fidelity are novel contributions. While the core concept builds upon existing randomized smoothing literature (Cohen et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021), the proposal clearly distinguishes itself by addressing the unique challenges of high-dimensional generative models and developing new theoretical frameworks for them. The proposal acknowledges its relationship to prior work while emphasizing its novel contributions, stating it aims to provide 'the first general framework for verifiable adversarial robustness in high-dimensional conditional generative models,' which appears justified based on the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations from randomized smoothing literature. The mathematical formulation follows logical principles and extends existing theory in a reasonable way. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate models, datasets, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) The proof sketch for the Wasserstein distance bounds is somewhat abstract, and it's not entirely clear how these bounds will be derived in practice; (2) The aggregation strategies for outputs from multiple noisy samples need more theoretical justification, especially for text generation where simple averaging isn't applicable; (3) The proposal assumes that adding noise to embeddings will yield meaningful certified robustness, but this assumption may need further validation. While these concerns don't invalidate the approach, they represent areas where the theoretical foundations could be more thoroughly developed. The proposal acknowledges these challenges and outlines plans to address them, which demonstrates awareness of potential limitations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable scope. The implementation leverages existing frameworks (PyTorch, Hugging Face) and builds upon established randomized smoothing techniques. The selected models (Stable Diffusion, Llama 2) are publicly available and well-documented. However, several practical challenges affect the feasibility: (1) Computational requirements for running multiple forward passes through large models like diffusion models and LLMs could be prohibitive, especially with large N; (2) Deriving theoretical certificates for complex generative models is mathematically challenging and may require simplifying assumptions; (3) The proposed adaptive noise schedules and gradient-based calibration add implementation complexity; (4) Evaluating generation quality, particularly for text, involves subjective human evaluation which can be resource-intensive. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they may require adjustments to the scope or timeline. The proposal acknowledges the computational overhead but could more explicitly address mitigation strategies for these feasibility concerns."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety with high potential impact. Providing certified robustness guarantees for conditional generative models directly tackles one of the key concerns of the Safe Generative AI Workshop: vulnerability to adversarial attacks. The significance is well-articulated in several dimensions: (1) Enhanced safety by preventing harmful content generation triggered by subtle input manipulations; (2) Increased trustworthiness for deploying generative AI in critical applications; (3) Theoretical advancement of robust ML beyond classification to generative modeling; (4) Practical tools for the AI safety research community. The work could significantly influence how generative models are deployed in high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal, and educational contexts. The proposal makes a compelling case that SmoothGen would be the first framework to provide verifiable adversarial protection for high-dimensional generative tasks, which would represent a substantial contribution to the field. The potential for broader applications beyond the specific models tested further enhances its significance."
