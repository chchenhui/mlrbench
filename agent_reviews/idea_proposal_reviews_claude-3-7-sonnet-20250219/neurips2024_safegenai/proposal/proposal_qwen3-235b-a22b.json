    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'vulnerability to adversarial attacks' topic from the Safe Generative AI Workshop task, focusing on certified robustness for generative models. The proposal faithfully expands on the core idea of extending randomized smoothing to conditional generative models, with detailed methodology that builds upon the literature review. It incorporates key concepts from the cited papers, particularly leveraging randomized smoothing techniques (Ref 1, 5) and extending them to generative contexts (Ref 7, 9). The proposal also addresses limitations identified in prior work, such as scalability to high-dimensional outputs and adaptive noise control. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions challenges with computational overhead, the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve this limitation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, literature review, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained with appropriate mathematical formalism, including explicit equations for the smoothing process, theoretical certificates, and adaptive noise calibration. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined metrics, baselines, and implementation details. The proposal effectively communicates complex concepts through a logical progression from problem statement to solution approach. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for aggregating outputs in different model types could be more precisely defined, (2) some technical terms (e.g., Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality) are mentioned without sufficient explanation for non-experts, and (3) the relationship between the adaptive noise calibration and the theoretical certificates could be more explicitly connected."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. First, it extends randomized smoothing from classification to high-dimensional conditional generative models, which represents a non-trivial advancement beyond existing work. Second, the adaptive noise calibration mechanism based on gradient sensitivity is an innovative approach to balance robustness and generation quality. Third, the derivation of Wasserstein stability certificates for generative outputs extends theoretical guarantees in new directions. The literature review clearly establishes that while randomized smoothing has been applied to conditional GANs (Ref 7), the proposal goes beyond by addressing high-resolution generation, adaptive noise control, and theoretical guarantees for Wasserstein distances. However, the core technique still builds upon established randomized smoothing principles rather than introducing an entirely new paradigm, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness with well-founded theoretical formulations and methodological rigor. The randomized smoothing approach is mathematically well-defined, with clear formulations for noise injection, output aggregation, and theoretical certificates. The Wasserstein robustness certificate derivation builds on established mathematical principles (Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality). The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and implementation details. However, there are some areas where the technical foundations could be strengthened: (1) the derivation of the Wasserstein bound is stated but not fully proven, (2) the adaptive noise calibration approach, while intuitive, lacks rigorous justification for why gradient sensitivity is the optimal criterion, (3) the proposal doesn't fully address how the theoretical guarantees might be affected by the adaptive noise approach, and (4) there's limited discussion of potential failure modes or edge cases where the certificates might not hold."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible approach with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, it builds on established randomized smoothing techniques with clear implementation steps, uses existing datasets, and proposes reasonable evaluation metrics. The methodology is well-defined with specific equations and algorithms. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) The computational cost is significant—running 100 parallel inferences per sample would substantially increase resource requirements, especially for large models like diffusion models or LLMs; (2) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the latency overhead issue; (3) Implementing adaptive noise calibration requires computing gradient sensitivity, which may be challenging for black-box or very large models; (4) The expected outcome of '≥80% certified radii on ImageNet-scale diffusion models at FID < 20' seems ambitious given the state of the art; and (5) The human evaluation component adds logistical complexity. While the approach is theoretically implementable, these practical challenges reduce its immediate feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety—the vulnerability of generative models to adversarial attacks—which aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on safe generative AI. The significance is high for several reasons: (1) It provides the first framework for certified robustness in high-dimensional generative tasks, filling an important gap in the literature; (2) The approach has direct applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare and legal tech, where adversarial vulnerabilities could have serious consequences; (3) The theoretical contributions advance understanding of robustness in generative contexts; and (4) The work could enable safer deployment of generative AI in sensitive applications. The proposal clearly articulates these impacts and connects them to broader societal concerns. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the computational overhead, which might restrict practical deployment in resource-constrained settings, and by the focus on input perturbations rather than addressing other safety concerns like harmful content generation or bias."
