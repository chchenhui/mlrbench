    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Vulnerability to adversarial attacks' topic from the Safe Generative AI Workshop task, focusing on certified robustness for generative models. The proposal faithfully expands on the core idea of extending randomized smoothing to conditional generative models as outlined in the research idea. It builds upon the literature review effectively, particularly drawing from papers 1 (Cohen et al.'s randomized smoothing), 7 (Zhang et al.'s work on GANs), and 5 (Cohen et al.'s generalized smoothing). The methodology addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, including high-dimensional generative models, balancing robustness and quality, and adaptive noise calibration. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions computational overhead as a challenge, the proposal only briefly addresses this through 'dynamic sampling' without extensive discussion of efficiency optimizations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate mathematical formulations. The algorithmic framework is broken down into three distinct stages (Input Perturbation, Noisy Generation, Aggregation) that are easy to follow. The theoretical foundations, including Theorem 1 on certified robustness, are precisely formulated. The experimental design section clearly outlines datasets, models, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for applying randomized smoothing to discrete outputs like text could be more detailed, as the aggregation via majority voting is mentioned but not fully explained; (2) The relationship between the Wasserstein distance bound and the certified radius could be more explicitly connected; and (3) The adaptive noise calibration section introduces gradient-based noise scaling without fully explaining how the loss function is defined for generative models."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by extending randomized smoothing from classification to conditional generative models, which represents a significant advancement. The adaptive noise calibration using gradient-based scaling is an innovative approach to balance robustness and generation quality. The application of Wasserstein barycenters for output aggregation in the continuous case is also a fresh perspective. However, the core technique of randomized smoothing itself is not new, as acknowledged by the extensive citations to prior work. The proposal builds incrementally on existing methods, particularly Zhang et al.'s work on GANs (reference 7), rather than introducing a completely new paradigm. While the application to diffusion models and LLMs is novel, the theoretical framework follows established patterns from the randomized smoothing literature. The proposal would benefit from more explicit discussion of how SmoothGen differs from or improves upon the approach in reference 7 for conditional GANs."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulation of randomized smoothing for generative models is well-developed, with clear definitions of the smoothing distribution, aggregation methods, and certified robustness bounds. The use of the Neyman-Pearson lemma to derive the certified radius follows established theoretical approaches in the literature. The adaptive noise calibration is grounded in gradient-based optimization principles. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) The assumption of L-Lipschitz continuity for the base generator may be difficult to verify or enforce for complex models like diffusion models or LLMs; (2) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle the computational challenges of computing Wasserstein barycenters in high-dimensional spaces; and (3) The theoretical guarantees focus on bounding the Wasserstein distance between output distributions, but don't explicitly connect this to practical notions of robustness for generative models (e.g., semantic consistency)."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The core randomized smoothing approach has been successfully applied to classification tasks and GANs, suggesting its extension to other generative models is plausible. The experimental design uses established models (Stable Diffusion, GPT-3, Llama-2) and datasets. However, several practical challenges affect feasibility: (1) Computational demands of running multiple forward passes through large generative models like Stable Diffusion or GPT-3 could be prohibitive, especially for real-time applications; (2) Computing Wasserstein barycenters for high-dimensional outputs like images is computationally intensive and may require approximations; (3) The gradient-based noise scaling requires access to model gradients, which may not be available for black-box or API-based models; and (4) Evaluating certified robustness for generative models is more complex than for classifiers, potentially requiring new evaluation protocols. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they will require significant engineering effort and potential methodological adaptations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety: ensuring robustness of generative models against adversarial attacks. This is highly relevant given the increasing deployment of generative AI in sensitive domains like healthcare and legal applications. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's focus on certified robustness, which provides provable guarantees rather than empirical robustness that might fail against novel attacks. The expected outcomes include both theoretical contributions (robustness certificates) and practical benefits (improved safety in deployment). The impact section convincingly argues for applications in safety-critical domains and contributions to research standards for AI safety. The proposal aligns well with growing concerns about generative AI safety and regulatory requirements for trustworthy AI systems. However, the significance is somewhat limited by potential trade-offs between robustness and generation quality/efficiency, which might restrict practical adoption in some contexts. Additionally, while the proposal focuses on input perturbations, it doesn't address other safety concerns like harmful content generation or privacy risks mentioned in the workshop topics."
