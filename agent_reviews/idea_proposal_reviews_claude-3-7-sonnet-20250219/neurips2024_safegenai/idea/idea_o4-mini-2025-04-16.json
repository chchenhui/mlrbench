        "justification": "The SmoothGen idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Vulnerability to adversarial attacks' topic mentioned in the Safe Generative AI Workshop. The proposal directly tackles the problem of adversarial perturbations in conditional generative models, which is explicitly listed as a concern in the workshop topics. The focus on providing certified robustness for generative models like diffusion models and large language models matches the workshop's emphasis on safety concerns in these exact technologies. The idea also indirectly addresses 'Limited robustness in out-of-distribution contexts' by improving model resilience to perturbed inputs."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, proposed solution, and evaluation approach. The concept of extending randomized smoothing to conditional generative models is explained concisely, and the technical approach involving sampling noisy variants and aggregating outputs is well-defined. The introduction of adaptive noise schedules and gradient-based noise calibration shows thoughtful consideration of implementation details. However, some minor ambiguities exist around the specific mathematical formulation of the Wasserstein certificates and how exactly the ensemble outputs would be aggregated for different types of generative models (text vs. image), which prevents a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea shows notable originality by extending randomized smoothing—a technique primarily used for classification tasks—to the domain of conditional generative models. This cross-domain application represents a fresh perspective. While randomized smoothing itself is not new, its application to generative models, especially with the proposed adaptive noise schedules and gradient-based noise calibration in latent space, offers innovation. The claim that it's 'the first framework for verifiable adversarial protection in high-dimensional generative tasks' suggests novelty, though similar approaches may exist in limited forms. The idea builds upon existing concepts but combines them in a way that addresses an important gap in the literature."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Randomized smoothing is a well-established technique in classification tasks, and the mathematical foundations for extending it to generative models seem sound. The proposed evaluation on benchmark diffusion and autoregressive models is practical. However, there are implementation challenges: (1) the computational overhead of generating multiple outputs for each input could be substantial for large generative models, (2) deriving tight theoretical certificates for complex generative models may require significant mathematical work, and (3) maintaining generation quality while adding noise introduces a difficult trade-off. These challenges are acknowledged in the proposal through the introduction of adaptive techniques, but they will require careful engineering and optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI safety that has become increasingly important with the widespread deployment of generative models. Providing certified robustness against adversarial attacks for generative models would be a major advancement in ensuring their safe use in sensitive domains. The impact could be substantial across multiple fields including healthcare (medical image synthesis), legal tech, content creation, and any domain where generative models are deployed. The theoretical guarantees would significantly improve trust in these systems, addressing a key barrier to their adoption in high-stakes applications. The work bridges an important gap between theoretical robustness guarantees (common in classification) and the practical needs of generative AI systems."
