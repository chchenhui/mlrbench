        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the DL4C workshop's focus on 'Developer Productivity and HCI for Code' and 'Post-training and Alignment for Code' by proposing a human-AI co-adaptation framework for personalized code assistants. The proposal faithfully expands on the core idea of creating adaptation loops using multi-modal feedback and online learning techniques. It thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works on personalization (Dai et al., 2024; Hou et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024), proactive assistance (Zhao et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2024), and human-AI collaboration (Holter & El-Assady, 2024; Guan et al., 2023). The methodology section clearly outlines the implementation of the IDE plugins, feedback mechanisms, and adaptation algorithms mentioned in the original idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated, with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The technical approach is explained in detail, including the mathematical formulations for the adaptation algorithms. The experimental design is thoroughly described with specific metrics and procedures. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The conceptual figure is only described but not actually provided, which would have enhanced understanding of the co-adaptation loop; (2) Some technical details about the implementation of the meta-learning approach could be more concrete; (3) The distinction between the online learning module and meta-learning components could be more clearly delineated in terms of when each would be applied. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically presented."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to personalized code assistance through continuous, bidirectional adaptation between developers and AI assistants. While personalization in AI code assistants has been explored (as noted in the literature review), the concept of a real-time co-adaptation loop with rich, multi-modal feedback mechanisms represents a significant advancement. The integration of online learning and meta-learning techniques for immediate model updates based on diverse feedback types (implicit and explicit) is particularly innovative. The proposal also introduces novel evaluation metrics for measuring the effectiveness of personalized code assistants. However, some individual components (like RLHF, PEFT techniques) are adaptations of existing methods rather than completely new inventions. Nevertheless, their combination and application in this specific context of real-time code assistance personalization represents a fresh and valuable contribution to the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and methodological rigor in many aspects. The technical approach is well-grounded in established machine learning techniques (PEFT, LoRA, online learning, meta-learning) with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear metrics and evaluation procedures. However, there are some areas where the soundness could be improved: (1) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address potential challenges with catastrophic forgetting during online updates; (2) The computational feasibility of performing frequent model updates in real-time settings needs more detailed consideration; (3) While privacy concerns are mentioned, the specific techniques for ensuring privacy-preserving adaptation could be more thoroughly developed; (4) The statistical power analysis for determining the appropriate sample size in the user study is not explicitly discussed. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a challenging but potentially achievable research agenda. Several aspects support its feasibility: (1) The use of existing open-source LLMs as base models; (2) The focus on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to reduce computational requirements; (3) The well-defined experimental methodology. However, significant implementation challenges exist: (1) Real-time adaptation of large language models with minimal latency is computationally demanding and may require substantial resources; (2) Developing effective online learning algorithms that can rapidly update model behavior without degrading performance is technically complex; (3) Creating a seamless IDE integration that captures rich feedback without disrupting developer workflow requires sophisticated engineering; (4) Recruiting sufficient participants for the proposed user study (24-30 developers) may be challenging. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential technical limitations and fallback strategies. The timeline for completing all aspects of this ambitious project is also not specified, raising questions about its practical implementation within typical research timeframes."

        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in AI-assisted programming that has substantial practical and theoretical importance. If successful, this research could significantly enhance developer productivity by creating truly personalized code assistants that adapt to individual coding styles and preferences. The work has broad implications for: (1) Software engineering practices, potentially transforming how developers interact with AI tools; (2) Machine learning research, advancing techniques for online personalization of large models; (3) Human-computer interaction, providing insights into effective human-AI collaboration; (4) Responsible AI development, exploring methods for user-controlled adaptation while preserving privacy. The proposal directly addresses multiple focus areas of the DL4C workshop, including developer productivity, post-training alignment, and responsible AI for code. The potential for commercial impact is also significant, as the findings could influence the next generation of AI coding assistants.
