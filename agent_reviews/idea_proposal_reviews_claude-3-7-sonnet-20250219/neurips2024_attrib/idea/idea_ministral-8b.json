    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task description, particularly focusing on the 'Data attribution and selection' aspect mentioned in the task. It directly addresses how to attribute model outputs to training examples and how to select data to optimize performance. The proposal also covers data leakage monitoring, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description. However, it doesn't address some other aspects of the broader task, such as attributing model behavior to subcomponents or understanding algorithmic choices, which are mentioned as additional topics in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main components, and expected outcomes. The four main components (attribution methodology, data selection framework, monitoring data leakage, and expected outcomes) are defined with sufficient detail to understand the approach. However, there are some ambiguities in how these components would interact with each other, and the specific technical details of implementation are somewhat vague. For instance, while SHAP and LIME are mentioned, the exact methodology for scaling these techniques to large datasets isn't fully elaborated."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea combines existing techniques (SHAP, LIME, active learning, reinforcement learning) in a potentially useful way to address data attribution and selection. While the integration of these methods for the specific purpose of optimizing model performance is somewhat novel, the core techniques themselves are well-established. The proposal doesn't introduce fundamentally new algorithms or approaches, but rather applies and potentially extends existing ones. The focus on comprehensive data attribution and selection at scale has some innovative aspects, but the approach largely builds on existing work rather than proposing groundbreaking new methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally feasible with current technology and methods. Attribution techniques like SHAP and LIME exist and are well-documented, though scaling them to very large datasets presents challenges. Active learning and reinforcement learning for data selection are established approaches. The main feasibility concerns relate to computational efficiency when dealing with large-scale datasets and the complexity of integrating multiple techniques into a cohesive framework. The proposal acknowledges these challenges implicitly but doesn't detail specific solutions for overcoming them. Overall, the idea is implementable but would require significant engineering effort and methodological refinements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses an important problem in machine learning: understanding and optimizing the relationship between training data and model performance. As models and datasets grow larger, efficient data attribution and selection become increasingly critical for both performance and ethical considerations. The potential impact is substantial across domains where data quality and model interpretability are essential. By helping practitioners select optimal training data and understand model behavior, this research could lead to more efficient, transparent, and less biased models. The significance is particularly high given the growing concerns about data quality, model interpretability, and computational efficiency in large-scale machine learning systems."
