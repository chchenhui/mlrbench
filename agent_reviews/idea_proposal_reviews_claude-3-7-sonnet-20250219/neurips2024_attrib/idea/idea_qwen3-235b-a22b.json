        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Data attribution and selection' and 'Data leakage/contamination' topics. It directly tackles the challenge of attributing model behavior to specific data sources and examines how data feedback loops (particularly LLM-generated content) influence model biases. The proposed randomized influence analysis framework is designed precisely to trace model behaviors back to data sources, which is a central theme of the workshop. The idea also touches on how to select data to optimize performance while minimizing harmful biases, which aligns with the task's focus on data selection for downstream performance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (tracing model biases to data sources), the proposed methodology (randomized influence analysis with perturbation of data subsets), and expected outcomes (scalable attribution metrics and guidelines for data pruning). The technical approach involving causal mediation analysis and influence functions is well-specified. Minor ambiguities exist around the exact implementation details of the randomized estimators and how the distributed batch ablation would work in practice, but these are reasonable omissions for a research proposal at this stage."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining existing techniques (influence functions, causal mediation analysis) in a new context - specifically for attributing model biases to data sources at scale. While influence analysis and data attribution methods exist, the application to disentangling the causal influence of mixed data sources (authentic vs. synthetic) represents a fresh approach. The focus on LLM-generated content and feedback loops is particularly timely. However, the core technical components (influence functions, ablation studies) build upon established methods rather than proposing fundamentally new algorithms, which prevents it from receiving the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces some significant challenges. While the conceptual approach is sound, implementing randomized influence analysis at the scale of large language models would be computationally intensive. The proposal acknowledges this by suggesting efficient estimators and distributed batch ablation, but these optimizations may still be insufficient for truly large-scale models. Additionally, accurately tagging data by source in real-world datasets can be difficult, especially for internet-scale data. The causal mediation analysis would require careful experimental design to establish valid causal claims. These challenges don't make the idea impractical, but they do represent substantial hurdles that would require considerable resources and methodological refinements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI development with high potential impact. Understanding how different data sources causally influence model biases is essential for responsible AI development, especially as models increasingly train on mixed data that includes synthetic content. The ability to attribute biases to specific data sources would enable more targeted interventions in training pipelines, potentially preventing harmful feedback loops in model generations. This work could significantly advance data governance practices for large models and help establish standards for data quality assessment. The implications extend beyond academic interest to practical applications in reducing harmful biases in deployed AI systems, making this research highly significant."
