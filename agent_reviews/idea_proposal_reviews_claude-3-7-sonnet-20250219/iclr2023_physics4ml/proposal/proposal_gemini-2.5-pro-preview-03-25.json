        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on leveraging physics structures for machine learning by proposing Symplectic Neural Networks that embed geometric conservation laws into neural architectures. The proposal thoroughly incorporates the literature review, citing and building upon works like He & Cai (2024), Xiong et al. (2022), and David & MÃ©hats (2023). It addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, including architectural design for symplectic preservation, training stability, and generalization to non-separable systems. The proposal also aligns with the workshop's questions about leveraging physical structures in ML and applying physics-inspired methods to classical ML tasks like video prediction and time-series forecasting."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, research gap, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical content is presented with appropriate mathematical formalism, making the symplectic integration approach understandable. The proposed SympNet architecture is explained in detail, including specific implementations for separable and non-separable Hamiltonians. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, some aspects could benefit from further clarification, such as the exact implementation details for the non-separable Hamiltonian case and how the symplectic structure would be maintained in more complex architectures like Transformers. The proposal occasionally uses technical terminology that might be challenging for readers without a background in Hamiltonian mechanics."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to embedding symplectic structures directly into neural network architectures. While previous works like Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) have explored learning Hamiltonians, and others have used symplectic integrators or loss functions, this proposal's focus on designing network layers that are inherently symplectic by construction offers a fresh perspective. The extension to non-separable Hamiltonians and integration with GNNs and sequence models adds originality. However, the core idea builds upon existing concepts in symplectic integration and physics-informed neural networks. The proposal acknowledges related work like NSSNNs (Xiong et al., 2022) and the approaches of He & Cai (2024), indicating evolutionary rather than revolutionary advancement. The application to classical ML tasks like video prediction is innovative but not entirely unprecedented in the literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations in both Hamiltonian mechanics and deep learning. The mathematical formulation of symplectic maps and their implementation in neural networks is rigorous and well-justified. The use of Hamiltonian splitting methods to design symplectic layers is theoretically sound and builds on established numerical integration techniques. The proposal correctly identifies the conservation properties that would be preserved by such architectures and provides clear mathematical expressions for the layer transformations. The experimental design includes appropriate metrics for evaluating both task performance and conservation law adherence. However, there are some potential challenges that could be addressed more thoroughly, such as the computational complexity of implicit methods for non-separable Hamiltonians and the potential trade-offs between expressivity and strict symplecticity. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed error analysis of the proposed integration schemes."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction with clear implementation paths for the separable Hamiltonian case. The use of automatic differentiation to ensure conservative forces is practical within modern deep learning frameworks. The experimental design with progressively complex systems (from pendulums to molecular dynamics) provides a sensible development path. However, several challenges may affect feasibility: (1) The non-separable Hamiltonian case relies on more complex methods like generating functions or implicit integration, which may be difficult to implement efficiently in standard deep learning frameworks; (2) Training stability could be an issue, especially for higher-order methods or when dealing with chaotic systems; (3) The computational overhead of ensuring symplecticity might be significant, particularly for large-scale applications; (4) The extension to sequence models and GNNs, while conceptually outlined, would require substantial engineering effort to implement effectively. Overall, the core ideas are implementable, but the full scope of the proposal is ambitious and may require prioritization of specific aspects."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important gap in physics-informed machine learning by focusing on geometric conservation laws that are fundamental to many physical systems. If successful, SympNets could significantly improve the reliability and long-term stability of ML models for scientific simulations, addressing a critical need in fields like molecular dynamics, astrophysics, and materials science. The potential impact extends beyond scientific applications to classical ML tasks, where the inductive bias of conservation laws could enhance generalization and data efficiency. The work directly contributes to the workshop's goal of leveraging physics structures for ML and could foster interdisciplinary collaboration. The open-source implementation would facilitate adoption and further research. However, the significance depends on demonstrating clear advantages over existing approaches like HNNs and proving that the architectural constraints don't overly limit expressivity for complex systems. The proposal could more explicitly quantify the expected improvements in terms of prediction accuracy, energy conservation, or data efficiency compared to baselines."
