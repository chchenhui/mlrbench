    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on synthetic data generation for overcoming data scarcity, privacy concerns, and bias issues. The methodology incorporates differential privacy mechanisms (DP-SGD during fine-tuning) and fairness constraints (demographic parity, equalized odds) as outlined in the research idea. The proposal builds upon the literature review by extending work from papers like DP-TBART, DP-LLMTGen, and TableDiffusion, while addressing the key challenges identified in the literature review regarding balancing utility, privacy, and fairness. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets (Adult Income, German Credit, MIMIC-III) and evaluation metrics that align with those mentioned in the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence. The technical details, including mathematical formulations for DP-SGD and fairness constraints, are precisely defined. The experimental design outlines specific datasets, preprocessing steps, evaluation metrics, and baseline models for comparison. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for constrained decoding could be more thoroughly explained, (2) the relationship between the fairness loss function and the actual generation process could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some details about the implementation of the moments accountant method are assumed rather than explicitly stated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining differential privacy and fairness constraints within an LLM-based tabular data synthesis framework. While individual components (DP-SGD, fairness constraints, LLMs for tabular data) have been explored separately in the literature, their integration into a unified framework represents a fresh approach. The constrained decoding mechanism with fairness-aware masking is particularly innovative. However, the core techniques (DP-SGD, fairness penalties in loss functions) build upon established methods rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The proposal extends existing work (e.g., DP-TBART, DP-LLMTGen) rather than presenting a completely novel paradigm, which is appropriate but limits its groundbreaking potential."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The DP-SGD approach is well-established and correctly formulated, with appropriate privacy accounting via the moments accountant method. The fairness constraints are grounded in recognized metrics like demographic parity and equalized odds. The experimental design includes comprehensive evaluation metrics covering utility, privacy, fairness, and data quality. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the effects of different components. However, there are some minor concerns: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address potential conflicts between privacy and fairness objectives, which might require careful balancing, (2) the hyperparameter λ in the fairness loss function needs justification for its selection, and (3) while the approach to constrained decoding is sound in principle, more details on its implementation would strengthen the technical rigor."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Using Llama-3-8B as the base model is practical, and the DP-SGD implementation can leverage established libraries like Opacus. The datasets chosen are publicly available, and the computational infrastructure (NVIDIA A100 GPUs with PyTorch+DeepSpeed) is appropriate for the task. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) fine-tuning large models like Llama-3-8B with DP-SGD may require significant computational resources and careful optimization to avoid instability, (2) the fairness-aware beam search during decoding might be complex to implement efficiently, and (3) achieving the anticipated results (ε ≤ 2 while maintaining ≥85% utility) is ambitious given the known trade-offs between privacy and utility. The proposal acknowledges some limitations and offers mitigation strategies, which strengthens its feasibility assessment."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem at the intersection of privacy, fairness, and synthetic data generation, with potential for substantial impact. If successful, it would enable the creation of high-quality tabular datasets that satisfy both differential privacy guarantees and fairness constraints, facilitating regulatory compliance in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. The broader implications for policy, fair algorithm development, and scientific advancement are well-articulated. The work could establish a new benchmark for trustworthy synthetic data generation. However, the impact might be somewhat limited by the focus on tabular data only (though this is a deliberate scope choice), and the practical adoption would depend on how well the method scales to very large datasets and complex real-world scenarios beyond the test datasets mentioned."
