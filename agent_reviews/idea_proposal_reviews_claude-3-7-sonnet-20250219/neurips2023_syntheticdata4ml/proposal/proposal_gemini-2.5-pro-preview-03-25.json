    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the three key challenges outlined in the workshop description: data scarcity, privacy concerns, and bias/fairness issues in tabular data. The proposed DP-Fair-TabLLM framework specifically targets the generation of synthetic tabular data using LLMs with differential privacy and fairness constraints, exactly as outlined in the research idea. The methodology incorporates relevant techniques from the literature review, including DP-SGD for privacy (as in papers by Tran & Xiong, Afonja et al.) and fairness constraints (similar to Johnson & Lee, Grey & Yellow). The proposal acknowledges the existing work while clearly positioning its contribution at the intersection of LLMs, differential privacy, and fairness for tabular data synthesis."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The problem statement, research objectives, and methodology are all precisely defined. The technical approach is explained in detail, with clear descriptions of data representation, model architecture, DP integration, fairness integration, and evaluation metrics. Mathematical formulations are provided where appropriate (e.g., for DP-SGD and fairness metrics). The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The only minor areas that could benefit from further clarification are: (1) more specific details on how the fairness regularization term L_fair would be implemented in practice, (2) clearer explanation of how the serialization of numerical features would work, and (3) more concrete examples of the trade-offs between privacy, utility, and fairness that might be expected."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining three key elements in a novel way: (1) using pre-trained LLMs for tabular data synthesis, (2) incorporating differential privacy via DP-SGD during fine-tuning, and (3) integrating fairness constraints directly into the training objective. While each individual component has precedents in the literature (e.g., DP-TBART, DP-LLMTGen for privacy; various works on fair data generation), the unified approach addressing all three aspects simultaneously using LLMs is innovative. The proposal extends beyond existing work by focusing specifically on the three-way trade-off between utility, privacy, and fairness in the context of LLM-based tabular data generation. However, it builds significantly on existing techniques rather than proposing fundamentally new algorithms, which limits its groundbreaking nature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates strong theoretical foundations. The differential privacy approach using DP-SGD is well-established and correctly formulated, with appropriate privacy accounting methods mentioned. The fairness metrics (Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds) are properly defined, and the integration strategies are theoretically justified. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, covering utility, privacy, and fairness dimensions with appropriate metrics for each. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and ablation studies to isolate the effects of different components. The proposal shows awareness of potential limitations and trade-offs. The only minor weakness is that some technical details of the fairness regularization term could be more rigorously defined, particularly how it would be calculated during mini-batch training in a way that remains differentiable and computationally efficient."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The use of pre-trained LLMs and DP-SGD is practical, with established libraries available (e.g., Opacus for DP-SGD). The datasets mentioned are publicly available and commonly used in fairness research. However, several aspects may require significant effort: (1) Efficiently implementing DP-SGD for large LLMs can be computationally expensive and may require substantial GPU resources; (2) Designing an effective fairness regularization term that works well during mini-batch training could be challenging; (3) Balancing the three-way trade-off between utility, privacy, and fairness will likely require extensive hyperparameter tuning; (4) The evaluation across multiple datasets, baselines, and metrics is comprehensive but time-consuming. While these challenges are manageable, they represent non-trivial implementation hurdles that could extend the timeline or require scaling back some aspects of the evaluation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem at the intersection of privacy, fairness, and synthetic data generation, which has significant implications for trustworthy ML in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. If successful, the DP-Fair-TabLLM framework would provide organizations with a practical tool to leverage sensitive data for model development without compromising individual privacy or perpetuating biases. This directly aligns with the workshop's goals of empowering trustworthy ML training. The potential impact extends to facilitating data sharing, addressing data scarcity (especially for underrepresented groups), and advancing generative modeling research. The comprehensive evaluation framework proposed could also help establish benchmarking standards in this emerging field. While the immediate impact might be limited to research communities and early adopters in industry, the long-term significance for ethical AI development is substantial."
