    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description of 'Practical ML for Limited/Low Resource Settings.' It directly addresses the challenge of deploying ML models in developing countries with limited computational resources, which is a central focus of the task. The proposed adaptive knowledge distillation framework specifically targets the 'Algorithms and Methods' topic area mentioned in the task, particularly 'approaches to training and inference on resource constrained devices' and 'model distillation.' The idea's focus on reducing computational requirements by 80% while maintaining 90%+ performance directly addresses the need for balancing accuracy/latency tradeoffs mentioned in the 'Industry Experience and Applications' section. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address some of the social and policy aspects mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (deploying ML models in resource-constrained environments), proposes a specific solution (adaptive knowledge distillation framework), and outlines three concrete innovations (resource-aware teacher selection, selective feature imitation, and incremental learning capabilities). The expected benefits are quantified (80% reduction in computational requirements while maintaining 90%+ performance). The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details of how exactly the three innovations would be implemented and how the framework would adapt to different levels of resource constraints. More specifics on the metrics and evaluation methodology would further enhance clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by introducing an adaptive approach to knowledge distillation specifically designed for low-resource environments. While knowledge distillation itself is not new, the three proposed innovations represent fresh perspectives: (1) resource-aware teacher selection that dynamically adapts to available computational power is particularly novel; (2) selective feature imitation based on task relevance offers a thoughtful refinement to standard distillation; and (3) incremental learning capabilities represent a practical innovation for real-world deployment. However, each individual component builds upon existing research in model compression and distillation rather than introducing fundamentally new paradigms, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology and methods. Knowledge distillation is a well-established technique with proven effectiveness, and the proposed adaptations build on existing research rather than requiring theoretical breakthroughs. The resource-aware teacher selection and selective feature imitation would require careful algorithm design but are implementable with current ML frameworks. The quantified goals (80% reduction in computational requirements while maintaining 90%+ performance) are ambitious but within the realm of possibility based on existing distillation literature. The main implementation challenges would likely be in creating a truly adaptive system that works across diverse resource environments and validating performance across different domains (healthcare, agriculture, etc.), which is why it doesn't receive the highest feasibility score."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in democratizing ML across developing countries and resource-constrained environments. If successful, it could have substantial real-world impact by enabling sophisticated ML capabilities in settings like rural healthcare facilities or agricultural monitoring systems where they are currently inaccessible. The significance is heightened by the growing performance gap between state-of-the-art models (which require enormous computational resources) and what's deployable in low-resource settings. By maintaining 90%+ of teacher model performance with 80% fewer computational requirements, this approach could significantly narrow the 'AI divide' between resource-rich and resource-constrained environments. The potential applications across multiple domains (healthcare, agriculture, education) further amplify its significance."
