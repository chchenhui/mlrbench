        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description's focus on mathematical reasoning and AI. It directly addresses the workshop theme of measuring mathematical reasoning capabilities in AI systems, which is explicitly mentioned as a key area of interest. The proposed dynamic benchmark specifically targets the evaluation of mathematical reasoning in LLMs, which is central to the workshop's guiding question about machine comprehension of mathematics. The idea also touches on the comparative aspect between human and machine reasoning by creating difficulty-calibrated tests that can meaningfully assess genuine logical generalization versus pattern memorization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear three-step pipeline: (1) sampling formal libraries to propose candidate statements, (2) using LLMs to draft proof sketches, and (3) checking and refining proofs in Lean. The motivation and expected outcomes are explicitly stated. The only minor ambiguities relate to the specific implementation details of how the difficulty calibration will work in practice and how the novelty score will be calculated. While these are mentioned, they could benefit from further elaboration to make the methodology completely transparent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea presents a highly innovative approach to benchmarking mathematical reasoning in AI. While there are existing mathematical reasoning benchmarks, the dynamic, continuously evolving nature of this benchmark is a significant innovation. The closed-loop system that integrates formal verification (through Lean) with LLM capabilities to generate new theorems represents a fresh approach. The tagging system for calibrating difficulty based on multiple dimensions (domain, proof-length, dependency-graph complexity, and novelty) is particularly original and addresses known limitations of static benchmarks that quickly saturate or fail to distinguish between memorization and true reasoning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology, though it presents moderate implementation challenges. The integration of Lean (a proof assistant) with LLMs has been demonstrated in previous work, making this technical foundation solid. However, creating a truly effective closed-loop system that can generate mathematically interesting and novel theorems (rather than trivial variations) will require significant engineering effort. The difficulty calibration system, while conceptually sound, may require extensive tuning to ensure it accurately reflects true reasoning difficulty. Community engagement for contributions also presents a practical challenge that will require careful management and incentive structures."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI evaluation - the tendency of static benchmarks to saturate quickly and fail to distinguish genuine reasoning from memorization. By creating a dynamic, evolving benchmark that continuously challenges AI systems with new mathematical problems, it could significantly advance our understanding of mathematical reasoning capabilities in AI. The approach could become a new standard for rigorous benchmarking in this domain, with potential applications extending beyond mathematics to other areas requiring logical reasoning. The transparency in tracking progress would be valuable for the entire research community and could guide architecture innovations in a principled way."
