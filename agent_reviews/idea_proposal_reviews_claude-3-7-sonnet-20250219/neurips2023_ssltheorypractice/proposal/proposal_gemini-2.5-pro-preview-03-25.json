        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging the gap between theory and practice in SSL by developing theoretical foundations for sample complexity in contrastive vs. non-contrastive methods. The proposal incorporates key elements from the research idea, including the theoretical framework for deriving sample complexity bounds, validation across multiple modalities (vision, language, time-series), and practical guidelines for method selection based on data availability. It also builds upon the literature review by extending the work of Hieu et al. (2024) on generalization bounds, exploring the duality concepts from Garrido et al. (2022), and considering the spectral embedding connections identified by Balestriero & LeCun (2022). The proposal comprehensively addresses the identified challenges from the literature review, particularly the theoretical understanding of sample complexity and the differences between SSL paradigms."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the theoretical framework, including formal mathematical expressions of the contrastive and non-contrastive objectives. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear descriptions of datasets, algorithms, and evaluation metrics. The expected outcomes and impact are well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The precise mathematical formulation of the sample complexity bounds could be more explicitly stated, rather than presented in a general form; (2) The connection between the theoretical bounds and the empirical validation methodology could be more tightly linked; and (3) Some technical terms and concepts (e.g., 'Rademacher Complexity', 'algorithmic stability') are introduced without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with these concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality in its comparative analysis of sample complexity between contrastive and non-contrastive SSL methods. While individual components (theoretical analysis of SSL, empirical comparisons) have been explored separately in prior work, the proposal's integrated approach combining rigorous theoretical bounds with systematic empirical validation across multiple modalities represents a fresh perspective. The focus on sample complexity as a key differentiator between SSL paradigms is relatively unexplored in the literature. However, the proposal largely builds upon existing theoretical frameworks (e.g., statistical learning theory, information theory) and established SSL methods (SimCLR, BYOL, DINO) rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts or techniques. The novelty lies more in the comparative analysis and cross-modal validation than in the development of new theoretical tools or SSL algorithms."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness in its theoretical framework and methodology. The formalization of SSL objectives is mathematically precise, and the proposed approaches for deriving sample complexity bounds (using Rademacher complexity, algorithmic stability, and information-theoretic measures) are well-established in statistical learning theory. The experimental design is rigorous, with appropriate controls, ablation studies, and evaluation metrics. The proposal acknowledges the challenges in connecting theoretical bounds to empirical performance and proposes reasonable approaches to address them. The multi-modal validation strategy strengthens the soundness by testing the generality of the findings. However, there are some potential limitations: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle the gap between the idealized theoretical setting and the practical implementation details of complex SSL methods; (2) The theoretical analysis might not capture all relevant factors affecting sample complexity in practice (e.g., optimization dynamics, implicit biases of SGD); and (3) The proposal could more explicitly discuss potential failure modes or limitations of the theoretical framework."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, but with some significant challenges. On the positive side, the experimental components are clearly implementable using standard datasets and established SSL algorithms. The theoretical analysis builds on existing frameworks in statistical learning theory. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Deriving tight and meaningful sample complexity bounds for complex deep learning models is notoriously difficult, and the proposal may be overly optimistic about the expressiveness of the bounds that can be obtained; (2) The cross-modal analysis spanning vision, language, and time-series data represents a substantial workload that may be difficult to complete comprehensively; (3) The proposal doesn't specify the computational resources required, which could be substantial given the need to train multiple SSL models with varying dataset sizes across different modalities; (4) The connection between theoretical bounds and empirical measurements may prove more challenging than anticipated, potentially limiting the practical impact of the theoretical results. While ambitious, the core components of the proposal are feasible with appropriate scoping and prioritization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant gap in SSL research with potentially high impact. Understanding the sample complexity of different SSL paradigms would provide valuable theoretical insights into why certain methods work better than others and offer practical guidance for deploying SSL in data-constrained environments. The cross-modal analysis would extend the significance beyond vision-centric SSL research. The work directly addresses the workshop's call for bridging theory and practice in SSL. The potential outcomes could influence both algorithm development (by inspiring sample-efficient SSL methods) and practical applications (by guiding method selection based on data availability). However, the significance depends on obtaining sufficiently tight and interpretable bounds that provide meaningful insights beyond what can be determined empirically. The proposal's impact would be enhanced if it could demonstrate cases where theoretical predictions lead to surprising or counter-intuitive practical recommendations that wouldn't be obvious from empirical studies alone."
