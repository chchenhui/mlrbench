        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, which calls for bridging the gap between theory and practice in self-supervised learning. The proposal directly addresses theoretical foundations of SSL by deriving sample complexity proxies for SSL tasks, which matches the task's explicit interest in 'sample complexity of SSL methods' and 'theoretical foundations of SSL'. The curriculum learning approach based on these theoretical insights directly responds to the call for 'theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks' and 'comparative analysis of different auxiliary tasks'. The implementation across multiple domains (vision and language) also aligns with the task's interest in SSL for various data modalities."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear three-part structure: (1) deriving sample complexity proxies, (2) designing a curriculum controller, and (3) implementing and validating the approach. The proposal specifies concrete metrics for success (20-30% fewer epochs, 2-5% higher accuracy). The methodology is explained with sufficient detail to understand the approach. However, some technical aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as how exactly the 'mutual information gaps and spectral properties' will be estimated in practice, and what specific mechanisms the curriculum controller will use to weight and schedule tasks."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea offers a fresh perspective by applying curriculum learning specifically to self-supervised tasks based on their theoretical complexity. While curriculum learning itself is not new, and theoretical analyses of SSL exist separately, the integration of these approaches—using theoretical complexity measures to guide a curriculum of SSL tasks—appears innovative. The proposal to create lightweight proxies for sample complexity that can be used during training is particularly novel. The approach doesn't completely reinvent SSL, but rather provides a principled framework to organize and schedule existing SSL techniques, which represents a valuable innovation in how we approach SSL training."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with existing technology and methods. It builds upon established SSL frameworks (SimCLR, MAE, BERT) and applies curriculum learning, which has been successfully implemented in other contexts. The computational requirements seem reasonable for academic or industry research. However, there are implementation challenges: accurately estimating sample complexity for diverse SSL tasks may be difficult; designing a curriculum controller that works well across different domains requires careful engineering; and validating the approach across multiple benchmarks demands significant computational resources. These challenges are substantial but not insurmountable with proper expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant gap in SSL research—the disconnect between theoretical understanding and practical implementation. If successful, it could lead to more efficient SSL training (requiring less data and computation), which has broad implications for making deep learning more accessible and environmentally sustainable. The potential improvements in downstream accuracy (+2-5%) would be meaningful in practical applications. Moreover, the theoretical insights gained could inform future SSL method development. The impact would extend across multiple domains where SSL is applied, including vision, language, and potentially other modalities mentioned in the task description. The work directly contributes to the workshop's goal of bridging theory and practice in SSL."
