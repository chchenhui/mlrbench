    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenges of healthcare time series data mentioned in the task description, including irregular sampling, missing values, multimodality, and the need for interpretable models. The proposal expands on the initial idea of a Continuous-Time Masked Autoencoder (CT-MAE) with detailed methodology that incorporates all key elements: learnable temporal kernels, masking strategies across modalities, and a continuous-time transformer architecture. The literature review is well-integrated, with the proposal building upon recent advances in masked autoencoders (like bioFAME and MMAE-ECG) while addressing the specific challenges of irregular time series data mentioned in papers like 'Time-Series Transformer for Irregularly Sampled Data'. The proposal's focus on creating a foundation model for healthcare time series that can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks aligns perfectly with the workshop's themes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations that make the model architecture and training objectives understandable. The continuous-time encoding mechanism, masking strategy, and multi-modal decoder are all clearly defined. The experimental design section provides specific datasets, baseline methods, and evaluation metrics, giving a comprehensive picture of how the research will be conducted and evaluated. The only minor areas that could benefit from additional clarity are: (1) some technical details about how the cross-modal attention mechanism specifically works could be more explicit, and (2) the relationship between the uncertainty estimation in the loss function and its practical benefits could be more thoroughly explained. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents significant novelty in several aspects. The integration of continuous-time representation learning with masked autoencoding for multi-modal health data is a novel combination that addresses a critical gap in the literature. While masked autoencoders have been explored in various domains (as seen in the literature review with bioFAME and MMAE-ECG), and continuous-time models exist for irregular time series, the proposal innovatively combines these approaches with several unique contributions: (1) the adaptive temporal kernel learning through learnable basis functions, (2) the multi-level masking strategy that operates across time, features, and modalities, and (3) the uncertainty-aware reconstruction loss. The approach of treating irregularity as an inherent property rather than a preprocessing concern represents a paradigm shift in healthcare time series analysis. The proposal builds upon existing work but extends it in meaningful ways that could advance the state-of-the-art in this domain."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness with well-defined mathematical formulations and a coherent methodology. The continuous-time transformer architecture with temporal basis functions is theoretically well-grounded, and the multi-level masking strategy is logically designed to encourage learning robust representations. The training objective incorporating uncertainty estimation is mathematically sound. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the choice of Gaussian-process-inspired basis functions could be more thoroughly justified compared to other possible temporal encodings, (2) the interaction between the time-decay function in the attention mechanism and the temporal basis functions could be analyzed more rigorously, and (3) the theoretical guarantees for the model's ability to handle missing data could be more explicitly stated. The experimental design is comprehensive, but some details about hyperparameter selection and optimization strategies could be more specific. Overall, the approach is technically sound but has some areas that would benefit from deeper theoretical analysis."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined components and evaluation strategies. The use of existing healthcare datasets (MIMIC-IV, PhysioNet Challenge 2019, PPMI) is practical and appropriate for the research questions. The transformer-based architecture, while computationally intensive, is implementable with current deep learning frameworks. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the computational requirements for training a multi-modal continuous-time transformer on large healthcare datasets could be substantial, and the proposal doesn't fully address computational optimization strategies; (2) the complexity of implementing and tuning the multi-level masking strategy across different modalities might present practical challenges; (3) the evaluation on multiple downstream tasks requires significant resources and time. The proposal would benefit from more discussion of potential implementation challenges and mitigation strategies. Nevertheless, the core methodology is implementable with current technology and resources, making the overall approach feasible with appropriate computational resources."

        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical need in healthcare AI with potentially high impact. The development of a foundation model that can effectively handle irregular, multi-modal health time series without preprocessing or imputation would represent a significant advancement in the field. The potential clinical applications are compelling and well-articulated, including early warning systems, personalized treatment recommendations, and continuous remote monitoring. The model's ability to provide uncertainty estimates and interpretability through attention mechanisms addresses key requirements for clinical deployment. The expected technical contributions extend beyond healthcare to other domains with irregular time series data. The proposal aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on advancing time series modeling in healthcare to bring these models closer to deployment. The potential to bridge the gap between theoretical advances and practical clinical applications makes this work highly significant, with the possibility of improving patient outcomes through more accurate and reliable AI systems."
