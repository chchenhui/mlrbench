    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenges of health time series data mentioned in the task description (irregular sampling, missing values, multi-modality, etc.) and proposes a solution that matches the outlined research idea of a Continuous-Time Masked Autoencoder. The proposal incorporates relevant literature from the review, citing all 10 papers and building upon them appropriately. The methodology section clearly explains how the CT-MAE architecture handles irregular timestamps through learnable temporal kernels, implements masking of both values and timestamps, and uses cross-modal attention for reconstruction - all key elements from the original idea. The downstream tasks (sepsis forecasting, arrhythmia detection) align with the workshop's focus areas. The only minor inconsistency is that while the idea mentioned EHR, ECG, and wearable channels specifically, the proposal sometimes discusses more general multi-modal health data."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical notation and diagrams. The continuous-time embedding mechanism, masking strategy, and cross-modal decoder are all described with sufficient technical depth. The experimental design section clearly outlines datasets, procedures, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for handling multiple modalities with different dimensionalities and sampling rates could be more explicitly defined; (2) The proposal could more clearly distinguish between the novel contributions and existing approaches from the literature; (3) Some technical details about the implementation of the continuous-time attention mechanism could be more precisely specified. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel combination of existing techniques rather than a fundamentally new approach. The core innovation lies in adapting the Masked Autoencoder framework to handle continuous-time, irregularly sampled, multi-modal health data. Specifically, the integration of learnable temporal kernels for timestamp encoding, the masking of both values and timestamps, and the cross-modal attention mechanism for reconstruction represent meaningful innovations. The proposal builds upon existing work in MAEs [1,2,3,4,5] and continuous-time modeling [6,7], but extends these approaches in ways that address the specific challenges of health time series. While not revolutionary, the CT-MAE architecture represents a significant advancement over existing methods by natively handling irregularity and multi-modality without requiring imputation or modality-specific preprocessing. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work while acknowledging its foundations."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The continuous-time embedding approach using learnable temporal basis functions is theoretically well-grounded, drawing from established work in Neural Processes and Gaussian Process kernels. The adaptation of the Transformer architecture for irregular time series follows sound principles from the literature [6]. The masking strategy and loss function are appropriately designed for the self-supervised learning objective. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, ablation studies, and evaluation metrics that will effectively test the model's capabilities. The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and includes ablation studies to evaluate key components. The only minor limitations are: (1) The exact choice of temporal basis functions could be more thoroughly justified; (2) The proposal could more explicitly address potential issues with very long sequences or computational complexity; (3) Some additional theoretical analysis of the model's properties would strengthen the soundness further."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic goals and available resources. The datasets mentioned (MIMIC-IV, PhysioNet databases) are publicly accessible and appropriate for the proposed tasks. The methodology builds on established frameworks (Transformers, MAEs) that have existing implementations that can be adapted. The experimental design is comprehensive but manageable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) The computational requirements for training on large-scale multi-modal health datasets could be substantial, especially with continuous-time attention mechanisms; (2) Linking different data sources (e.g., MIMIC-IV EHR with waveform data) may present practical challenges with data alignment and preprocessing; (3) The timeline for completing all the proposed experiments, ablation studies, and analyses is not specified but seems ambitious; (4) The proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in hyperparameter tuning for such a complex model architecture. Despite these concerns, the core research is definitely implementable with current technology and methods, making it a feasible project overall."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in healthcare time series analysis with potentially high impact. If successful, the CT-MAE model could significantly advance the field of health time series analysis by providing a foundation model that natively handles the key challenges of irregularity, missingness, and multi-modality. The potential clinical applications in sepsis forecasting and arrhythmia detection address important healthcare problems with direct patient impact. The focus on robustness, interpretability, and uncertainty quantification addresses key requirements for clinical deployment. The proposal aligns perfectly with the workshop's themes of foundation models and behavioral health. The expected outcomes include both methodological contributions (novel architecture) and practical tools (pre-trained model). The significance is somewhat limited by: (1) The focus on specific clinical tasks rather than a broader range of applications; (2) Potential challenges in clinical adoption that aren't fully addressed; (3) Limited discussion of how the approach might generalize beyond the specific data types mentioned. Nevertheless, the proposal has strong potential to advance both the technical field and clinical practice."
