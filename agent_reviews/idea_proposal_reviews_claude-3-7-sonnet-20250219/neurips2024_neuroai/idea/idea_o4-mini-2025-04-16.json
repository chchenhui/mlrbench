    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the NeuroAI workshop task description. It directly addresses the 'Neuro-inspired Computations' topic by proposing a spiking neural network architecture on neuromorphic hardware (Intel Loihi). It also strongly connects to 'Self-supervised Systems in NeuroAI' by implementing predictive coding and active inference, which are explicitly mentioned in the task description. The proposal incorporates Hebbian-style updates for learning without labels, which matches the workshop's interest in biologically-inspired learning mechanisms. The focus on energy efficiency and adaptation also aligns with the workshop's goals of developing 'computationally less intensive artificial systems trained using small-data regimes.' The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some other topics mentioned in the task description like explainable AI or cognitive functions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with good clarity. It clearly articulates the core components: hierarchical predictive coding in SNNs, active inference for camera control, and self-supervised learning through prediction error minimization. The hardware platform (Intel Loihi) is specified, and evaluation metrics (energy usage, adaptation speed, robustness) are defined. The expected outcomes are also clearly stated. However, some technical details could be more precisely defined - for example, the exact learning rules for the Hebbian-style updates, the specific architecture of the multilayer SNN, and the mathematical formulation of the active inference module. While these might be beyond the scope of a brief proposal, their absence slightly reduces the clarity of how the system would be implemented."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several cutting-edge concepts in a unique way. While predictive coding, active inference, and SNNs have been explored separately, their integration on neuromorphic hardware specifically for vision tasks represents a fresh approach. The active inference module controlling a pan/tilt event-based camera is particularly innovative. However, the core components (predictive coding, SNNs, active inference) are established concepts in the field, and similar approaches have been proposed conceptually, though perhaps not implemented on neuromorphic hardware with this specific combination of features. The proposal builds upon existing frameworks rather than introducing fundamentally new computational principles, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents some implementation challenges. Intel Loihi and other neuromorphic platforms provide the necessary hardware foundation, and event-based cameras are commercially available. The principles of predictive coding and active inference have been implemented in various computational models. However, scaling hierarchical predictive coding to complex visual tasks on neuromorphic hardware remains challenging. The self-supervised learning approach without labels is ambitious and may require significant algorithmic innovation to achieve good performance. The integration of the active inference module with physical camera control adds another layer of complexity. While all components are technically feasible, their successful integration at scale would require substantial engineering effort and possibly theoretical advances in learning algorithms for SNNs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses significant challenges in both AI and neuroscience. If successful, it could advance neuromorphic computing by demonstrating practical applications in vision tasks with ultra-low power consumption. The self-supervised learning approach could reduce dependence on labeled data, addressing a major limitation in current AI systems. The active inference component could improve robustness in dynamic environments, which is crucial for real-world applications. From a neuroscientific perspective, it could provide insights into how biological brains implement predictive processing. The impact would be particularly strong in edge computing, robotics, and IoT applications where power efficiency and adaptability are critical. However, the immediate practical impact might be limited to specific domains rather than transforming AI broadly, which is why it doesn't receive the highest significance score."
