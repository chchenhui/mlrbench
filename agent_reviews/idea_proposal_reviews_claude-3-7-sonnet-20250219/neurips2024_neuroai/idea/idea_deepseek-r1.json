    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the NeuroAI workshop task description. It directly addresses the 'Self-supervised Systems in NeuroAI' topic by integrating predictive coding and active inference - both explicitly mentioned in the task description as key areas of interest. The proposal aims to create more sample-efficient AI that learns from limited data, which matches the workshop's goal of developing 'computationally less intensive artificial systems trained using small-data regimes.' The idea also touches on neuro-inspired computation by mimicking cortical processing mechanisms. The only minor limitation in consistency is that it doesn't explicitly address some other topics mentioned in the task description like explainable AI or cognitive functions, though it does indirectly relate to neuro-inspired reasoning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with good clarity. It clearly articulates the motivation (addressing data inefficiency in current AI), the main approach (combining predictive coding with active inference in a hierarchical neural framework), and expected outcomes (50% reduction in training data needs and improved adaptability). The proposal includes a concrete example of application in robotic navigation to illustrate the concept. However, some technical details about the implementation of the hierarchical neural framework and how exactly the integration of predictive coding and active inference would be achieved could be more precisely defined. The metrics for evaluation are somewhat clear (comparison against traditional reinforcement learning in specific environments), but could benefit from more specific benchmarks or evaluation protocols."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea shows good novelty in its approach to integrating two neuroscience principles - predictive coding and active inference - into a unified framework for AI learning. While both concepts individually have been explored in AI research, their explicit combination in a hierarchical neural framework for sample-efficient learning represents a fresh perspective. The application to sparse-reward, changing environments also adds an innovative dimension. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that both predictive coding and active inference have already been studied in computational neuroscience and AI contexts separately, and some researchers have begun exploring their integration. The proposal builds upon existing concepts rather than introducing entirely new paradigms, though it does so in a thoughtful and potentially valuable way."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, both predictive coding and active inference have established computational frameworks that could serve as foundations. The proposed evaluation against traditional reinforcement learning is practical and achievable. However, integrating these complex neuroscience principles into a unified, hierarchical neural framework that actually achieves the stated 50% reduction in training data is ambitious. The proposal doesn't detail how to overcome known challenges in scaling predictive coding models to complex environments or how to efficiently implement active inference (which can be computationally expensive). The robotic navigation example is reasonable, but implementing a system that can generalize across different environments while maintaining sample efficiency would require significant engineering and theoretical advances."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a significant problem in AI: the need for more sample-efficient learning systems that can operate effectively in dynamic, low-data settings. If successful, achieving a 50% reduction in training data requirements would represent a meaningful advance with broad implications. The potential applications in personalized healthcare and autonomous systems highlight real-world impact. The approach aligns well with the growing interest in neuroscience-inspired AI methods, potentially contributing to both fields. The significance is particularly high given the current limitations of data-hungry deep learning approaches and the increasing need for AI systems that can adapt quickly to new environments with limited experience. However, the significance would be even higher if the proposal more explicitly addressed how the approach might lead to fundamental new insights about learning in both artificial and biological systems."
