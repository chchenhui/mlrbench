    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the NeuroAI workshop's focus on neuro-inspired computations and self-supervised systems, particularly through predictive coding and active inference frameworks. The proposal builds upon the literature review's key works, especially the Active Predictive Coding Networks by Rao et al. and Meta-Representational Predictive Coding, extending these concepts into a hierarchical framework for reinforcement learning. The research objectives clearly address the challenges identified in the literature review, including sample efficiency, compositional representation learning, and balancing exploration/exploitation. The methodology section provides a comprehensive technical approach that implements the core idea of using predictive coding-driven active inference for data-efficient reinforcement learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical formulations are presented with appropriate mathematical notation and explanations. The hierarchical predictive coding architecture, free energy minimization approach, and active inference mechanism for action selection are all well-defined. The experimental design outlines specific environments and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the different levels of the hierarchy could be more explicitly connected to temporal and spatial scales with concrete examples, (2) the meta-learning for adaptive precision section could provide more intuition about how the precision parameters relate to uncertainty, and (3) some of the mathematical formulations, while correct, might benefit from additional explanation of their practical implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by integrating several existing concepts in a novel way. The hierarchical predictive coding architecture combined with active inference for action selection represents a fresh approach to reinforcement learning. The integration of meta-learning for adaptive precision is particularly innovative, allowing the system to modulate learning rates based on uncertainty. However, the core components build significantly upon existing work in predictive coding networks (Rao et al., 2022; Gklezakos & Rao, 2022) and meta-representational predictive coding (Ororbia et al., 2025). While the proposal extends these approaches by emphasizing hierarchical processing and expected free energy minimization for action selection, it doesn't introduce fundamentally new computational principles. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and implementation of these principles rather than in proposing entirely new theoretical constructs."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for hierarchical predictive coding, free energy minimization, and active inference are well-grounded in established theoretical frameworks. The approach to implementing these concepts using neural networks (recurrent and convolutional) is appropriate and well-justified. The training algorithm integrates free energy minimization with reinforcement learning in a coherent manner. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) the Monte Carlo approach for action selection might face challenges in high-dimensional action spaces, which isn't fully addressed, (2) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve potential computational complexity issues, and (3) while the adaptive precision mechanism is theoretically sound, its practical implementation and convergence properties could be more thoroughly analyzed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with existing technology and methods, though it will require significant computational resources and careful implementation. The hierarchical predictive coding architecture can be implemented using standard deep learning frameworks, and the free energy minimization objective is computationally tractable. The experimental environments (sparse-reward tasks, POMDPs, exploration-heavy environments) are well-established in the RL community. However, several implementation challenges exist: (1) training deep hierarchical models with recurrent components can be unstable and may require careful hyperparameter tuning, (2) the Monte Carlo approach for expected free energy minimization could be computationally expensive for complex environments or large action spaces, (3) the meta-learning component adds another layer of complexity that might affect training stability, and (4) as acknowledged in the limitations section, the computational overhead of maintaining and updating hierarchical predictive models could be substantial compared to simpler RL approaches."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses important challenges in reinforcement learning and NeuroAI with potentially significant impact. If successful, the approach could substantially improve sample efficiency in RL, which is a critical limitation in many real-world applications. The bridging of neuroscience theories (predictive coding, active inference) with practical AI algorithms contributes to the core mission of NeuroAI research. The expected outcomes include not just improved algorithms but also theoretical insights into how brain-inspired principles can enhance learning efficiency. The practical applications span robotics, healthcare, and resource-constrained AI systems, addressing real-world needs. The proposal could also generate testable predictions for neuroscience, creating a virtuous cycle between AI and brain research. While the impact may not be transformative in the sense of creating an entirely new paradigm, it represents a significant advancement in integrating neuroscience principles into reinforcement learning algorithms with broad implications for both fields."
