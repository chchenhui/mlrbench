    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the NeuroAI workshop's focus on self-supervised systems, particularly predictive coding and active inference. The proposal elaborates on the core idea of integrating predictive coding and active inference into reinforcement learning to improve sample efficiency, which was the central concept in the research idea. The methodology section provides a detailed implementation plan that builds upon the literature review's emphasis on hierarchical predictive coding networks and active inference principles. The proposal also acknowledges the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as sample efficiency and balancing exploration with exploitation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology section provides a detailed step-by-step approach to implementing the proposed framework. The mathematical formulation adds rigor to the explanation of free energy minimization and action selection. The experimental design clearly outlines the tasks that will be used to evaluate the approach. However, there could be more clarity on how the hierarchical predictive coding network will be specifically structured (e.g., number of layers, types of neural networks) and how the active inference module will be implemented in practice. Additionally, while the mathematical formulation is present, some aspects of the integration between predictive coding, active inference, and reinforcement learning could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel integration of predictive coding and active inference principles into reinforcement learning. While these concepts have been explored separately in the literature (as evidenced by the cited works), their combination specifically for improving sample efficiency in RL represents a fresh approach. The hierarchical predictive coding network for world modeling combined with action selection based on expected free energy minimization provides an innovative framework. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that active predictive coding networks and meta-representational predictive coding have already been explored in the literature review. The proposal builds upon these existing concepts rather than introducing entirely new paradigms, though the specific application to sample efficiency in RL does add a novel dimension."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations, drawing appropriately from established theories of predictive coding and active inference. The mathematical formulation of free energy and action selection is technically sound and aligns with the principles described in the literature. The experimental design includes appropriate baseline comparisons with standard model-based and model-free RL algorithms. The hierarchical approach to predictive coding is well-justified given the complexity of the tasks. The methodology follows a logical progression from model initialization to action selection and policy updates. However, the proposal could benefit from more detailed discussion of potential challenges in implementing the hierarchical predictive coding network and how these might be addressed. Additionally, while the mathematical formulation is correct, more details on how the KL divergence term would be practically computed or approximated would strengthen the technical rigor."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and evaluation metrics. The selected experimental tasks (Cart-Pole, Sparse-Reward Gridworld, Complex Navigation) are standard benchmarks that are appropriate for evaluating the approach. The algorithmic steps provide a clear roadmap for implementation. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) The computational complexity of minimizing expected free energy for action selection might be high, especially in environments with large action spaces; (2) Training hierarchical predictive coding networks can be challenging and might require significant hyperparameter tuning; (3) The proposal doesn't specify the computational resources required or provide time estimates for the experiments. While the approach is implementable with current technology and methods, these challenges might require considerable effort to overcome, potentially affecting the timeline and scope of the research."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant challenge in reinforcement learning: sample efficiency. Improving data efficiency in RL has broad implications for various applications, including robotics, autonomous systems, and other domains where data collection is costly or time-consuming. The integration of neurobiologically inspired principles into RL aligns well with the NeuroAI workshop's goals and could contribute to bridging the gap between artificial and biological intelligence. If successful, the approach could lead to more efficient learning algorithms that require fewer interactions with the environment, potentially making RL more applicable to real-world problems. The focus on intrinsically motivated exploration through active inference principles could also advance our understanding of efficient exploration strategies. The significance is somewhat limited by the fact that the proposal focuses primarily on standard RL benchmarks rather than more complex real-world applications, but the potential for broader impact is clearly articulated."
