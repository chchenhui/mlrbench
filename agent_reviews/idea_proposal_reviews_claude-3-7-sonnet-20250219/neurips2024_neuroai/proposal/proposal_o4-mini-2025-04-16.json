        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the NeuroAI workshop's focus on self-supervised systems, particularly predictive coding and active inference. The proposal builds upon the literature review's emphasis on active predictive coding networks and hierarchical world models (Rao et al., 2022), while addressing the key challenge of sample efficiency identified in the literature review. The methodology section provides a comprehensive mathematical formulation of hierarchical predictive coding and expected free energy minimization, which is consistent with the core principles outlined in the research idea. The experimental design appropriately includes sparse-reward and hard-exploration benchmarks to test the sample efficiency claims, as specified in the original idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are specific and logically organized, providing a clear roadmap for the project. The methodology section presents a detailed mathematical formulation of the hierarchical predictive coding network and active inference principles, making the technical approach transparent. The experimental design specifies concrete benchmarks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the policy parameters φ and the H-PCN parameters θ could be more explicitly defined, (2) the precise formulation of the intrinsic reward derived from expected free energy could be more detailed, and (3) the implementation of the CEM sampling procedure for action selection could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating predictive coding and active inference principles into a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. While individual components (predictive coding, active inference, hierarchical world models) have been explored in prior work cited in the literature review, the proposal offers a novel synthesis through: (1) the specific hierarchical architecture that captures increasingly abstract features across layers, (2) the formulation of expected free energy that balances reward maximization with epistemic exploration, and (3) the PCAI-RL algorithm that unifies world-model learning and policy optimization. However, it builds significantly on existing work by Rao et al. (2022) on Active Predictive Coding Networks, rather than introducing an entirely new paradigm. The integration of these components for sample-efficient RL represents an incremental but valuable advance rather than a revolutionary breakthrough."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor in its formulation. The mathematical framework for hierarchical predictive coding is well-grounded in variational inference principles, with clear definitions of the generative and recognition models. The expected free energy objective properly balances extrinsic (reward-seeking) and intrinsic (information-seeking) motivations, consistent with theoretical work on active inference. The RL algorithm integrates these components coherently, with a sensible training procedure. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics for evaluation. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from further theoretical justification: (1) the choice of hierarchical structure and number of layers, (2) the specific form of the KL divergence term in the expected free energy, and (3) potential stability issues in training the hierarchical model. Overall, the approach is technically sound with minor areas for improvement in theoretical justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined implementation details. The hierarchical predictive coding network can be implemented using standard deep learning frameworks, and the active inference mechanism can be realized through Monte Carlo rollouts. The experimental benchmarks (MiniGrid, Montezuma's Revenge, continuous control tasks) are established environments with available implementations. However, there are several implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) the computational cost of performing Monte Carlo rollouts through the hierarchical model for action selection could be substantial, potentially limiting real-time performance; (2) training stability of the hierarchical model might be challenging, especially with the interplay between layers; (3) the CEM sampling with 500 population size and multiple iterations per step could be computationally intensive. The proposal acknowledges the need for substantial computational resources (A100 GPUs, 32 parallel environments), which is realistic but indicates the approach's resource demands. While ambitious, the project appears implementable with the specified resources and timeline."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in reinforcement learning—sample efficiency—which has substantial implications for real-world applications where data collection is expensive or risky. By bridging neuroscience theories (predictive coding, active inference) with reinforcement learning, the research contributes to the NeuroAI field's goal of leveraging biological principles to improve AI systems. The expected 2×–5× improvement in sample efficiency would represent a meaningful advance for applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and healthcare. The hierarchical architecture offers insights into how biological systems might organize knowledge at different levels of abstraction. The proposal also highlights energy efficiency benefits through reduced environment interactions, aligning with sustainable AI goals. The broader impact section convincingly argues for the project's significance across multiple dimensions: theoretical advancement in NeuroAI, practical improvements in real-world RL applications, and environmental sustainability. The significance is well-justified and extends beyond incremental improvements to potentially transformative impacts in sample-efficient learning."
