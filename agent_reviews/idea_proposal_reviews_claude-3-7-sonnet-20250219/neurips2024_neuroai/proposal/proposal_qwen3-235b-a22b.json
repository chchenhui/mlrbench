    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the NeuroAI workshop's focus on neuro-inspired computations and self-supervised systems, particularly leveraging predictive coding and active inference principles as highlighted in the task description. The proposal faithfully expands on the research idea of integrating predictive coding and active inference into reinforcement learning for improved sample efficiency. It thoroughly incorporates the literature review by building upon active predictive coding networks (APCNs) and meta-representational predictive coding (MPC), while addressing the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as sample efficiency, exploration-exploitation balance, and biologically plausible learning mechanisms. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions benchmarking against SPEQ (from the literature review), it could have more explicitly connected to some of the computational efficiency aspects discussed in that paper."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined with specific, measurable goals. The technical components are explained with appropriate mathematical formulations, including the hierarchical predictive coding network, free energy functional, and action selection mechanisms. The experimental design is comprehensive, detailing environments, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact relationship between the hierarchical layers could be more precisely defined, (2) some mathematical notations (e.g., the transition function) are introduced without full context, and (3) the connection between the theoretical bound in the expected outcomes and the methodology could be more explicitly developed. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of hierarchical predictive coding with active inference for reinforcement learning. While both predictive coding and active inference have been explored separately in computational neuroscience and some AI applications (as evidenced in the literature review), their combined implementation within a deep RL framework with dual optimization objectives represents a significant innovation. The approach of selecting actions to minimize expected free energy while maximizing rewards offers a fresh perspective on the exploration-exploitation dilemma. The hierarchical structure that propagates prediction errors across multiple levels of abstraction is also innovative. The theoretical contribution linking prediction error minimization to PAC learnability in RL appears to be original. However, the proposal builds upon existing work in active predictive coding networks rather than introducing an entirely new paradigm, which slightly limits its novelty. Nevertheless, the specific implementation and application to data-efficient RL represent a substantial advancement over prior work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations from both neuroscience (predictive coding, active inference) and machine learning (reinforcement learning, hierarchical models). The mathematical formulations for the hierarchical predictive coding network and free energy minimization are well-grounded in existing literature. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the theoretical bound linking prediction error minimization to PAC learnability is stated without sufficient derivation or justification, (2) the exact mechanism for balancing the dual objectives of free energy minimization and reward maximization needs more detailed analysis, and (3) the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components, but more rigorous statistical analysis plans would strengthen the methodology."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined components and experimental design. The implementation details are specific, including network architectures, training protocols, and evaluation metrics. The environments chosen (Mujoco, MiniGrid, Atari) are standard in RL research and appropriate for testing the claims. The computational requirements, while substantial, are within the range of typical deep RL research. However, there are several challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) training hierarchical models with multiple objectives can be unstable and may require extensive hyperparameter tuning, (2) the integration of predictive coding with policy optimization might face convergence issues not fully addressed in the proposal, (3) the computational complexity of computing expected free energy for action selection could be prohibitive in large action spaces, and (4) the timeline and resources required for the comprehensive evaluation across multiple environments and baselines may be underestimated. Despite these challenges, the proposal includes ablation studies and a step-by-step implementation plan that increases its feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning—sample efficiency—which has significant implications for real-world applications where data collection is costly or limited. By bridging neuroscience theories with practical RL algorithms, the research has the potential to advance both fields substantially. The expected 2-5× reduction in environment interactions would represent a major improvement over current methods. The framework's potential applications in energy-constrained systems, robotics, and healthcare demonstrate its broad impact. The theoretical contributions linking free energy minimization to exploration strategies could influence future research directions in RL. The focus on interpretable latent representations aligns with growing demands for explainable AI. The long-term vision of neuromorphic RL systems operating at human-brain energy levels is ambitious but impactful if achieved. While the significance is high, the proposal could more explicitly address how the approach might generalize beyond the specific environments tested to real-world, high-dimensional problems with partial observability."
