        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the workshop's focus on bidirectional human-AI alignment. It specifically addresses the dynamic, evolving nature of alignment that the workshop emphasizes, proposing a dual-agent framework that works in both directions: aligning AI with humans (through feedback incorporation and model updates) and aligning humans with AI (through explanations and visualizations). The idea touches on several workshop topics including interaction mechanisms, customizable alignment, and steerability. However, it could more explicitly address some aspects like societal norms or inclusive ecosystem considerations mentioned in the workshop scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and anticipated outcomes. The dual-agent framework comprising a primary AI model and metacognitive assistant is well-defined, and the operational mechanism (detecting preference drift, issuing queries, updating models) is logically presented. However, some technical details remain ambiguous - for instance, how exactly the 'online meta-reinforcement learning' would be implemented, what specific metrics would detect 'preference drift', and what the 'lightweight interface' would entail in practice. These aspects would benefit from further elaboration to enhance clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to bidirectional alignment. The concept of a metacognitive assistant that actively monitors alignment confidence and initiates feedback collection represents a fresh perspective on human-AI collaboration. The real-time adaptation mechanism goes beyond traditional static alignment methods, and the integration of active learning with metacognition for alignment purposes appears innovative. While some individual components (like reinforcement learning from human feedback) are established techniques, their combination into this dual-agent framework with real-time bidirectional adaptation represents a novel contribution to the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate feasibility challenges. On the positive side, it builds upon existing technologies like reinforcement learning and active learning, and the proposed evaluation tasks (document summarization and planning) are reasonable domains. However, several technical hurdles exist: (1) designing effective metacognitive monitoring that can reliably detect preference drift is non-trivial; (2) implementing online meta-reinforcement learning that can update models efficiently without catastrophic forgetting is challenging; (3) creating a lightweight interface that doesn't burden users while collecting meaningful feedback requires careful design; and (4) balancing the frequency of queries to avoid user fatigue while maintaining alignment presents a practical challenge. These issues don't make the idea infeasible, but they represent significant implementation challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical problem in AI alignment - the static nature of traditional alignment approaches that fail to adapt to evolving contexts and preferences. If successful, this work could significantly advance human-AI collaboration by enabling continuous co-adaptation and reducing misalignment incidents. The emphasis on user agency and transparency aligns with important ethical considerations in AI development. The potential impact extends beyond the specific applications mentioned (summarization and planning) to a broader class of AI systems that require ongoing alignment. The framework could serve as a blueprint for dynamic alignment approaches, potentially influencing how future AI systems are designed to maintain alignment over time."
