        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea of Customizable Alignment Profiles aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on bidirectional human-AI alignment. It directly addresses the workshop's emphasis on the dynamic, evolving nature of human-AI interactions by proposing a framework that allows for personalization while maintaining safety. The three-layer approach specifically tackles both directions mentioned in the task: 'Aligning AI with Humans' (through the contextual and personal layers) and 'Aligning Humans with AI' (through transparency and agency). The proposal also fits perfectly within the workshop's listed topic of 'Deployment: Customizable Alignment, Steerability, Interpretability, and Scalable Oversight.' The only minor reason it doesn't receive a perfect 10 is that it could more explicitly address some of the evaluation aspects mentioned in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a three-layer framework (Core Safety, Contextual, and Personal) that is easy to understand conceptually. The motivation is well-articulated, identifying a clear gap in current alignment approaches. The main components of the system are defined, including the interactive preference elicitation techniques and blockchain verification. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further elaboration: the specific mechanisms for capturing implicit behavioral signals, how conflicts between layers would be resolved, and more concrete examples of how the framework would operate in practice. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score, but overall the idea is well-defined and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by reframing alignment as a customizable, multi-layered system rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. The three-layer architecture that balances universal safety with personal preferences is a fresh perspective on alignment. The integration of blockchain for verification adds an innovative technical component. However, some elements of the proposal build upon existing concepts in preference learning, personalization systems, and value alignment research. The concept of eliciting user preferences for AI systems isn't entirely new, though the comprehensive framework and focus on democratization provides a novel angle. The idea offers a valuable recombination of existing concepts rather than a completely groundbreaking approach, which is why it receives a 7 rather than a higher novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposed framework faces moderate implementation challenges. The three-layer architecture is conceptually sound and technically feasible, and preference elicitation techniques already exist in various forms. However, several practical hurdles emerge: (1) Defining universal 'Core Safety' parameters that work across cultures and contexts would be extremely difficult; (2) The blockchain verification system adds complexity and potential scalability issues; (3) Capturing implicit behavioral signals ethically and accurately presents technical challenges; (4) Resolving conflicts between user preferences and safety boundaries would require sophisticated mechanisms. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they would require significant research and development efforts. The idea is implementable but would require considerable refinement and likely a phased approach to realization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI alignment that will only grow more important as AI systems become more integrated into diverse aspects of human life. The democratization of alignment could have far-reaching impacts on user agency, trust in AI systems, and the ethical deployment of AI across different cultural contexts. By creating a framework that respects individual differences while maintaining safety, it could significantly improve human-AI interactions and potentially prevent harmful one-size-fits-all alignment approaches. The proposal also has the potential to generate valuable data about diverse human values and preferences, which could inform future alignment research. The significance is high because it tackles a fundamental tension in alignment research between universal safety and individual autonomy, though it stops short of a perfect score because the immediate practical impact might be limited by implementation challenges."
