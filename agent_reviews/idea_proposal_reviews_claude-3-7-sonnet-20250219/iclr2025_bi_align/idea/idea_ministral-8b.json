    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns very well with the task description's focus on bidirectional human-AI alignment. It explicitly addresses both the AI-centered perspective (aligning AI with humans through feedback loops, customization, and monitoring) and the human-centered perspective (empowering humans to evaluate, explain, and collaborate with AI). The proposal covers several key topics mentioned in the workshop scope, including reinforcement learning with human feedback, interaction mechanisms, and customizable alignment. The idea's emphasis on dynamic and interactive approaches directly addresses the workshop's critique of traditional unidirectional alignment methods as inadequate."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented in a well-structured and comprehensible manner. It clearly articulates the motivation, main components, methodology, and expected outcomes. The distinction between AI-centered and human-centered perspectives is well-defined, making the bidirectional nature of the proposed framework evident. The methodology section provides concrete steps for implementation. However, some specific technical details about how the reinforcement learning with human feedback would be implemented or how the interfaces would be designed could have been elaborated further to make the proposal even clearer."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea presents a fresh approach by explicitly framing alignment as a bidirectional process and developing a comprehensive framework that integrates both AI-centered and human-centered perspectives. While individual components like reinforcement learning with human feedback or user-centered design are not entirely new, their integration into a cohesive framework for dynamic human-AI interaction represents a novel contribution. The proposal could have scored higher if it had introduced more groundbreaking technical innovations or specific novel algorithms rather than primarily combining existing approaches in a new framework."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology and methodologies. The proposed methods—surveys, interviews, prototyping, testing, and iterative refinement—are well-established research practices. The framework builds upon existing techniques like reinforcement learning with human feedback, which have demonstrated success. The iterative approach allows for continuous improvement based on feedback, enhancing practicality. The main implementation challenges would likely be in effectively integrating the AI-centered and human-centered components, but these appear manageable given the clear methodology outlined."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical challenge in AI development: ensuring alignment with human values while preserving human agency. The bidirectional approach could significantly advance how we think about and implement AI alignment, moving beyond static, unidirectional methods. The potential impacts mentioned—improved AI adaptability, enhanced human-AI collaboration, and a more inclusive alignment ecosystem—are substantial contributions to the field. The framework could influence both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of AI systems across various domains. The significance is particularly high given the growing deployment of AI in complex decision-making contexts where alignment is crucial."
