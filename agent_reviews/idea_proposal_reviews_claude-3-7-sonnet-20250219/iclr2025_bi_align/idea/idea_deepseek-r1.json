    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The Co-Adaptive Alignment idea is highly consistent with the workshop's focus on bidirectional human-AI alignment. It directly addresses both alignment directions specified in the task: 'Aligning AI with Humans' through RLHF and adaptive learning, and 'Aligning Humans with AI' through explanations tailored to user comprehension levels. The proposal explicitly frames itself around bidirectional adaptation, which is the core theme of the workshop. It also touches on multiple topics listed in the workshop scope, including methods (RLHF), evaluation metrics, interpretability, and human-AI interaction mechanisms. The only minor limitation is that it could more explicitly address some societal impact considerations mentioned in the workshop scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (one-sided alignment), the proposed solution (co-adaptive framework), and the specific mechanisms for implementation (parallel modules for AI learning and explanation generation). The evaluation approach is well-defined with dual metrics that measure both sides of the alignment relationship. The application domains (healthcare diagnosis, educational tutoring) are specified. The only aspects that could benefit from further clarification are the specific technical details of how the explanation module would adapt to different user comprehension levels and how the micro-assessments would be designed to avoid disrupting user experience."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to alignment. While RLHF and explainable AI are established research areas, the integration of these components into a bidirectional framework with dynamic adaptation on both sides represents a novel contribution. The concept of tracking 'human alignment maturity' as a formal metric appears to be particularly innovative, as most alignment research focuses primarily on AI performance. The dual metrics system that evaluates both AI and human adaptation is a fresh perspective. The idea doesn't completely reinvent fundamental techniques but rather combines and extends existing approaches in a new direction that addresses a gap in current alignment research."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology, though it presents some implementation challenges. The RLHF component is well-established, and explainable AI techniques like saliency maps and counterfactuals exist. The integration of these components is technically achievable. However, there are practical challenges: (1) designing non-intrusive micro-assessments that accurately measure user understanding, (2) creating explanation systems that can dynamically adjust to different user comprehension levels, and (3) developing metrics that reliably measure 'human alignment maturity.' The proposal would benefit from more details on how these challenges would be addressed, but the core components are implementable with current technology and methods."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in current alignment approaches by recognizing the bidirectional nature of human-AI interaction. Its significance is high because: (1) it could fundamentally improve how AI systems are deployed in high-stakes domains like healthcare and education, (2) it addresses the growing concern about human over-reliance or distrust in AI systems, (3) it provides a framework for measuring and improving human understanding of AI capabilities and limitations, which is crucial for responsible AI deployment, and (4) it bridges multiple disciplines (NLP, HCI, ML) in a way that could advance all fields. The potential impact extends beyond technical improvements to addressing core issues in responsible AI deployment."
