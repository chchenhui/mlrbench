    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bidirectional human-AI alignment by proposing a framework that enables dynamic co-adaptation between humans and AI systems. The proposal incorporates both AI-centered perspectives (adapting AI to human feedback) and human-centered perspectives (preserving user agency through interpretable explanations). The methodology builds upon the literature review, referencing relevant works like RL-SaLLM-F, KTO, and PPO-based RLHF implementations. The proposal's emphasis on real-time feedback loops, interpretable explanations, and longitudinal evaluation aligns perfectly with the original research idea. The only minor inconsistency is that some referenced papers have future dates (2025), which is likely an error."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical sequence. The technical approach is explained with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the hybrid objective function and its components understandable. The experimental validation section clearly outlines baselines, metrics, and study design. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific mechanisms for integrating implicit feedback (e.g., eye-tracking, behavioral cues) into the learning algorithm could be more detailed, (2) the process for generating interpretable explanations via LLMs could be elaborated further, and (3) the regularization term in the objective function (R(θ, θ_prior)) could be more explicitly defined. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality in its approach to bidirectional human-AI alignment. The integration of real-time feedback loops with interpretable explanations and a hybrid RL-imitation learning framework represents a fresh perspective on alignment. The emphasis on dynamic co-adaptation, rather than static alignment, is innovative and addresses a gap in current research. The proposal's use of multimodal feedback (both explicit and implicit) and the generation of interpretable explanations in real-time are novel aspects. However, many of the individual components (PPO-based RL, imitation learning, LLM-based explanations) are established techniques being combined in a new way rather than fundamentally new methods. The proposal builds incrementally on existing approaches like RLHF and RLAIF rather than introducing entirely new paradigms. While the combination is innovative, the novelty is more in the integration and application than in the development of groundbreaking new algorithms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The hybrid learning objective combining RL, imitation learning, and regularization is well-formulated and theoretically sound. The use of PPO as the base RL algorithm is appropriate given its stability and effectiveness in preference-based learning. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines (RLHF, RLAIF, static imitation learning) and a comprehensive set of metrics to evaluate alignment persistence, adaptability, user trust, and explanation quality. The longitudinal study design with 50 participants across two domains provides a robust evaluation framework. The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented. One area that could be strengthened is the theoretical analysis of convergence properties and stability guarantees for the hybrid learning approach, particularly in non-stationary environments. Additionally, while the proposal mentions preventing catastrophic forgetting through regularization, more details on how this balances with adaptation to new preferences would enhance the soundness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components, though it does face some implementation challenges. The core technologies (RL algorithms, imitation learning, LLM-based explanation generation) are established and accessible. The two task domains (collaborative robotics and personalized recommendations) are appropriate for studying dynamic alignment. The 6-week longitudinal study with 50 participants is ambitious but achievable with proper resources. However, several aspects present feasibility challenges: (1) collecting and integrating implicit feedback (eye-tracking, behavioral signals) in real-time requires sophisticated sensing and processing infrastructure; (2) generating interpretable explanations that accurately reflect policy updates is non-trivial; (3) balancing real-time adaptation with stability might require extensive hyperparameter tuning; and (4) the longitudinal study across two domains with multiple feedback modalities will generate large amounts of data requiring careful analysis. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the proposal impractical, but they do suggest that some scope adjustment or prioritization might be necessary during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI alignment research by focusing on dynamic, bidirectional adaptation rather than static, one-way alignment. This shift in perspective has significant implications for developing AI systems that remain aligned with human preferences over time and across contexts. The expected outcomes include both technical contributions (a novel hybrid learning algorithm and benchmark dataset) and human-centered impacts (increased user trust and guidelines for bidirectional alignment). The proposal's emphasis on interpretable explanations and user agency aligns with growing concerns about transparency and control in AI systems. The application domains (healthcare, education, ethical AI deployment) are areas where improved alignment could have substantial societal benefits. The projected improvements (15-20% in alignment persistence, 30% increase in user trust) would represent meaningful advances if achieved. While the proposal doesn't claim to solve all alignment challenges, it offers a valuable framework for addressing the dynamic nature of human-AI interactions, making it a significant contribution to the field."
