    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bidirectional human-AI alignment by developing a framework that enables continuous co-adaptation between humans and AI systems. The proposal incorporates both directions emphasized in the task: 'Aligning AI with Humans' through online preference learning and 'Aligning Humans with AI' through interpretable explanation generation. The methodology builds upon the literature review, particularly extending RLHF approaches (Huang et al., 2024; Rafailov et al., 2024) and addressing non-stationarity in human preferences. The proposal also acknowledges key challenges identified in the literature review, such as dynamic human preferences and interpretability concerns. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions multimodal feedback, it could have more explicitly connected to SHARPIE framework mentioned in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and research gap. The methodology section is particularly strong, providing detailed explanations of the framework architecture, learning algorithms (with mathematical formulations), feedback integration mechanisms, and evaluation approach. The technical components are explained with appropriate mathematical notation that enhances precision without sacrificing readability. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the relationship between the adaptive learning engine and the explanation generator could be more explicitly defined, (2) some technical terms (e.g., 'counterfactual explanations') are introduced without sufficient explanation for non-expert readers, and (3) the transition between theoretical formulations and practical implementations could be smoother in some sections."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality in its approach to bidirectional human-AI alignment. The core innovation lies in conceptualizing alignment as a dynamic, continuous process rather than a static training objective. Specific novel elements include: (1) the integration of multimodal feedback channels for real-time adaptation, (2) the temporal weighting mechanism for handling non-stationary rewards, and (3) the counterfactual explanation generation approach. However, many of the individual components build incrementally on existing techniques (e.g., PPO with preference learning, KL divergence regularization) rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The proposal effectively combines and extends existing approaches from RLHF literature rather than proposing entirely new paradigms. While the integration of these components into a cohesive framework for bidirectional alignment is valuable, the technical innovations are evolutionary rather than revolutionary."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The online learning algorithm is well-grounded in established reinforcement learning principles, particularly extending PPO with appropriate modifications for preference learning. The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented, with proper notation and justification. The framework architecture is logically structured with clear connections between components. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate control conditions, sample sizes, and evaluation metrics. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and challenges, demonstrating critical awareness of technical constraints. However, there are some areas that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the convergence properties of the online preference learning algorithm under non-stationary conditions are not fully analyzed, (2) the potential interactions between the KL divergence regularization and the adaptive exploration mechanism could be more thoroughly examined, and (3) the statistical power analysis for the proposed sample sizes is not explicitly provided."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components, though it faces some implementation challenges. The modular framework architecture allows for incremental development and testing, which enhances feasibility. The experimental design is practical, with reasonable participant numbers and study duration. The use of established reinforcement learning algorithms as a foundation provides a solid starting point. However, several aspects present feasibility concerns: (1) the real-time adaptation of complex models may face computational constraints, as acknowledged in the limitations section; (2) collecting high-quality multimodal feedback from users over extended periods (4-6 weeks) may face practical challenges with participant retention and data quality; (3) the integration of multiple feedback modalities into a unified representation requires sophisticated engineering that may be more complex than described; and (4) the explanation generation system, particularly the counterfactual explanations, may be computationally intensive for real-time deployment. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do suggest that some scope adjustment or technical compromises may be necessary during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current alignment methodologies by focusing on the dynamic, bidirectional nature of human-AI alignment. Its significance is substantial across multiple dimensions. Theoretically, it advances our understanding of alignment as a continuous, co-adaptive process rather than a static objective. Practically, the framework has direct applications in domains requiring sustained human-AI collaboration, such as healthcare, education, and assistive technologies. The emphasis on human agency and interpretable feedback loops addresses growing concerns about user disempowerment in AI systems. The proposal also contributes methodologically through novel evaluation approaches for measuring alignment quality over time. The potential impact extends beyond academic contributions to societal benefits through enhanced human control over AI systems and sustained alignment with evolving human values. However, the proposal's significance is somewhat limited by its focus on individual human-AI interactions rather than addressing broader societal alignment challenges at scale, and by the incremental nature of some of its technical innovations."
