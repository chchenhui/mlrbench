        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bidirectional human-AI alignment by proposing a Dynamic Human-AI Co-Adaptation Framework that enables continuous, real-time adaptation between humans and AI systems. The proposal incorporates both the AI-centered perspective (aligning AI with humans through online RL) and the human-centered perspective (aligning humans with AI through interpretability mechanisms) as outlined in the workshop description. The methodology builds upon the literature review, citing relevant works like SHARPIE for experimental frameworks (#1), online preference-based RL (#2), RLHF implementation details (#8, #9), and addressing challenges like strategic behavior (#3) and interpretability. The proposal also addresses all key challenges identified in the literature review, including dynamic preferences, bidirectional adaptation, non-stationarity, and interpretability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and motivation. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the conceptual framework, algorithmic details, and experimental design. The technical aspects are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations that enhance precision. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for translating different types of feedback into reward signals could be more precisely defined, (2) the explanation generation process could be elaborated with more concrete examples, and (3) some of the evaluation metrics (e.g., 'alignment score') could be more operationally defined. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically coherent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers significant novelty in several aspects. First, it introduces a real-time, bidirectional alignment framework that moves beyond traditional static, unidirectional approaches like offline RLHF. While RLHF itself is not new, the integration of online RL with real-time interpretability mechanisms for continuous co-adaptation represents a novel contribution. The hybrid RL-imitation learning approach to address non-stationarity is innovative, balancing adaptation with stability. The proposal's emphasis on explaining how specific feedback influences policy updates in real-time is particularly original, as most existing work focuses either on adaptation OR interpretability, not their synergistic integration. The framework also innovatively bridges ML techniques with HCI principles. While it builds upon existing methods (PPO, interpretability techniques), the combination and application to bidirectional alignment constitutes a fresh approach. The proposal could have scored higher if it had introduced more fundamentally new algorithms rather than adapting existing ones, but the overall conceptual framework and integration of components is highly original."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness overall. It is grounded in established reinforcement learning methods (PPO) and provides appropriate mathematical formulations for the online RL component. The conceptual framework for bidirectional adaptation is well-reasoned and logically structured. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas where technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) The mechanism for translating natural language feedback into reward signals is not fully specified, which is a non-trivial challenge; (2) The explanation generation methods are described at a high level but lack detailed technical specifications; (3) While non-stationarity is addressed through the hybrid RL-IL approach, the specific mechanisms for determining when and how to update the base policy could be more precisely defined; (4) The proposal acknowledges but does not fully resolve potential challenges like reward hacking or feedback inconsistency. These limitations somewhat reduce the technical soundness, though the overall approach remains well-founded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan with some significant implementation challenges. On the positive side, it leverages existing frameworks like SHARPIE for human-AI interaction experiments and builds on established RL algorithms like PPO. The experimental design is reasonable, with clearly defined tasks, conditions, and evaluation metrics. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Implementing real-time policy updates based on diverse feedback modalities while maintaining system stability is technically challenging; (2) Generating meaningful, human-interpretable explanations of policy updates in real-time presents significant computational and design challenges; (3) The longitudinal user studies with 40-50 participants across multiple sessions will require substantial resources and coordination; (4) Balancing adaptation with stability in the hybrid RL-IL approach may prove difficult to tune effectively. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively suggest that full implementation of the proposed framework would require significant engineering effort and might need to be scaled back in scope or complexity to be completed within a typical research timeframe."

        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI alignment research and practice, offering a framework that could fundamentally transform how we approach human-AI interaction. Its significance is evident in multiple dimensions: (1) Scientific impact: It advances the theoretical understanding of bidirectional alignment as a dynamic, interactive process rather than a static, one-way imposition of constraints; (2) Methodological impact: It provides a concrete framework for implementing and evaluating bidirectional alignment, potentially establishing new standards and practices in the field; (3) Practical impact: The framework could be applied across numerous domains including healthcare, education, and collaborative robotics, addressing real-world challenges in human-AI collaboration; (4) Societal impact: By empowering users to understand and guide AI systems while ensuring AI systems remain responsive to evolving human needs, the research directly contributes to more trustworthy, ethical AI deployment.
