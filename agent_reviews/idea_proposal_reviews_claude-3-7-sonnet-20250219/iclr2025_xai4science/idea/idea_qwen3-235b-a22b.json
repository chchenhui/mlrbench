        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on explainable AI for scientific discovery, particularly in healthcare. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of using models to improve understanding of the world and advance human knowledge. The proposal specifically targets a-priori (ante-hoc) interpretability through self-explainable models, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest. The idea also emphasizes practical knowledge discovery in healthcare, another key focus area of the workshop. The proposal's emphasis on bridging ML with mechanistic understanding perfectly matches the workshop's aim of connecting model behavior understanding with scientific knowledge discovery."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (black-box models hindering trust in healthcare), proposes a specific solution (knowledge-guided self-explainable models integrating biomedical ontologies into GNNs), and outlines expected outcomes (models revealing actionable scientific insights). The methodology involving attention mechanisms over regulatory networks is specified, as is the evaluation framework. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as the specific architecture of the proposed GNNs, how exactly the biomedical ontologies will be encoded, and more concrete examples of the additive models mentioned. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by proposing to integrate biomedical ontologies directly into model architectures rather than using them as post-hoc explanation tools. The concept of knowledge-guided self-explainable models that explicitly encode interpretable biological entities represents a fresh approach to explainable AI in healthcare. However, both GNNs for biomedical data and incorporating domain knowledge into models have been explored previously. The innovation lies in the specific combination and application to enable end-to-end learning of biological processes with built-in explainability. While innovative, it builds upon existing approaches rather than introducing a completely novel paradigm, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. GNNs are well-established, and biomedical ontologies (gene networks, pathways) are readily available. The proposed validation through wet-lab experiments is practical, though resource-intensive. The main implementation challenges include: 1) effectively encoding complex biomedical knowledge into model architectures without sacrificing performance, 2) ensuring the interpretability of attention mechanisms over large biological networks, and 3) coordinating interdisciplinary validation with domain experts. These challenges are significant but surmountable with appropriate expertise and resources. The proposal would benefit from more details on how to address potential computational complexity when scaling to large biological networks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a critical problem in healthcare AI - the lack of interpretability hindering clinical trust and scientific progress. If successful, this approach could have major impacts by: 1) enabling AI to contribute directly to scientific discovery of biological mechanisms, 2) improving clinical adoption of AI by enhancing trust through transparency, 3) accelerating precision medicine by identifying novel biomarkers and treatment targets, and 4) establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI that bridges predictive performance with mechanistic understanding. The potential to discover actionable scientific insights like synergistic drug targets or disease subtypes could lead to tangible improvements in patient outcomes. The significance is particularly high given healthcare's direct impact on human wellbeing."
