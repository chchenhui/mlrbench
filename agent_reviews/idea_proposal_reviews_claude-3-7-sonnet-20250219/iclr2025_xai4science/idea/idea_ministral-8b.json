        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on explainable AI (XAI) for scientific applications, specifically targeting climate science which is one of the three highlighted application areas. The proposal directly addresses a-posteriori interpretability methods (LIME and SHAP) for understanding model behavior, which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The idea also connects model interpretability to knowledge discovery and societal impact, which matches the workshop's goal of using models to improve understanding of the world and advance human knowledge."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear motivation, methodology, and expected outcomes. The proposal identifies specific XAI techniques (LIME and SHAP) and explains their application to climate models. However, there are some ambiguities that could be clarified: (1) it doesn't specify which climate prediction models will be targeted, (2) it doesn't detail how the XAI methods will be adapted to handle the spatial and temporal complexities of climate data, and (3) it lacks specifics on evaluation metrics for measuring improvements in interpretability. These details would make the proposal more precise and comprehensive."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea shows moderate novelty by applying established XAI techniques (LIME and SHAP) to climate models, which represents a valuable but incremental innovation. While the application domain is important, the core methodological approach relies on existing attribution techniques rather than developing fundamentally new XAI methods. The proposal doesn't clearly articulate how it will address the unique challenges of climate models (e.g., spatiotemporal dependencies, multi-scale phenomena) that might require novel extensions to current XAI approaches. The combination of XAI and climate science has been explored in recent literature, though there remains significant room for innovation in this intersection."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible as it builds upon established XAI techniques (LIME and SHAP) that have mature implementations available. Climate models and datasets are also widely accessible to researchers. The post-hoc nature of the proposed approach means it can be applied to existing climate models without requiring their modification, which increases practicality. The main implementation challenges would likely involve scaling these methods to handle the high dimensionality and complexity of climate data, and validating the explanations with domain experts. These challenges are substantial but surmountable with current computational resources and interdisciplinary collaboration."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research addresses a critical need in climate science where model transparency is essential for scientific advancement, policy decisions, and public trust. Improving the interpretability of climate models could have far-reaching impacts on climate policy and action, potentially contributing to addressing one of humanity's most pressing challenges. The work could also advance XAI methodology by testing and refining techniques on complex scientific models. The significance is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of the methodological innovation, but the potential real-world impact in climate science and policy elevates its importance considerably."
