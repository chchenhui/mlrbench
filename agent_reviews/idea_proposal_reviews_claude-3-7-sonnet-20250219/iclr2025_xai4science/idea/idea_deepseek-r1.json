        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing post-hoc attribution methods for understanding model behavior in healthcare, which is one of the three scientific application areas mentioned in the workshop description. The proposal directly connects XAI techniques with knowledge discovery in medical imaging, aiming to uncover new biomarkers while improving model trustworthiness. It perfectly addresses the workshop's goal of using model understanding to discover new human knowledge. The idea also includes evaluation of post-hoc interpretability accuracy through clinician validation, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest in the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (black-box nature of medical imaging models), the proposed approach (applying post-hoc attribution methods and analyzing the resulting heatmaps), and expected outcomes (improved trustworthiness, identification of novel biomarkers, protocol for hypothesis generation). The methodology involving iterative feedback between ML engineers and clinicians is well-explained. However, some minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific diseases or imaging modalities that would be targeted, and the exact validation protocols that would be used to confirm potential biomarkers. These details would strengthen the clarity further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by repurposing post-hoc attribution methods not just for model explanation but for scientific discovery of new biomarkers. While attribution methods like Grad-CAM and SHAP are well-established in the XAI field, their systematic application for biomarker discovery with clinician validation represents a fresh perspective. The integration of retrospective and prospective validation studies to confirm model-identified regions as genuine biomarkers is innovative. However, the core techniques mentioned (Grad-CAM, SHAP) are existing methods, and similar approaches of using model attributions for knowledge discovery have been explored, though perhaps not as systematically as proposed here."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and resources. Post-hoc attribution methods are well-developed and readily available in most deep learning frameworks. The medical imaging domain has abundant datasets and established model architectures. The proposed collaboration between ML engineers and clinicians is practical in academic medical centers. The retrospective validation using existing patient data is straightforward. The main implementation challenges would be in the prospective validation studies, which require more time and resources, and in establishing protocols for distinguishing known from novel biomarkers. Overall, the technical components are mature enough to make this research immediately implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in healthcare AI adoption - the lack of transparency and trustworthiness. Its potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: clinical (enabling more informed medical decisions), scientific (discovering new biomarkers for diseases), and methodological (creating protocols for hypothesis generation from ML models). The approach could accelerate medical discovery while making AI systems more trustworthy for clinical use. The dual benefit of improving model interpretability while potentially uncovering new medical knowledge makes this particularly significant. If successful, this work could establish a template for responsible AI adoption in healthcare that balances performance with explainability and scientific discovery."
