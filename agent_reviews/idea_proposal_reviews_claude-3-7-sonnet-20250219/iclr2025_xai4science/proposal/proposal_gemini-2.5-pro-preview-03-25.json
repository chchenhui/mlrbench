        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the XAI4Science workshop's goal of using models to discover new scientific knowledge, specifically in healthcare. The proposal builds upon the research idea of knowledge-guided self-explainable models for biomedical discovery, incorporating biomedical ontologies into GNNs and additive models as suggested. It also effectively leverages the literature review by building on approaches like Factor Graph Neural Networks for integrating biological knowledge and addressing the identified challenges of balancing performance with interpretability. The methodology section thoroughly details how domain knowledge will be structurally integrated into the model architecture, and the evaluation framework includes both predictive performance and explainability assessment as outlined in the original idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and impact. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The technical approach is explained in detail, including mathematical formulations that help understand the proposed KG-SEM framework. The experimental design and validation methods are comprehensively described. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific mechanisms for translating model insights into actionable scientific hypotheses could be more concrete, (2) some technical details in the mathematical formulation might be challenging for non-specialists to follow, and (3) the proposal could more clearly delineate how the approach differs from some of the cited works like Ma & Zhang's Factor Graph Neural Network."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a notable level of innovation by combining several existing concepts in a new way. The integration of biomedical knowledge graphs with GNNs and interpretable additive models to create self-explainable architectures is a fresh approach. The knowledge-guided attention mechanism that explicitly incorporates domain knowledge into the information propagation process is particularly innovative. However, the core techniques (GNNs, attention mechanisms, GAMs) are established methods, and similar approaches for incorporating biological knowledge into neural networks have been explored in the literature (e.g., the cited Factor Graph Neural Network). The proposal extends and refines these ideas rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The novelty lies more in the specific integration approach and application to biomedical discovery rather than in developing entirely new algorithmic techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulation of the KG-SEM framework is well-developed, showing how knowledge graphs can be integrated with GNNs and how attention mechanisms can be knowledge-guided. The loss function includes appropriate regularization terms to encourage desired properties like sparsity and knowledge alignment. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baseline comparisons, evaluation metrics, and validation approaches. The proposal acknowledges limitations (e.g., noting that full wet-lab validation is beyond scope) and proposes reasonable alternatives. The approach is grounded in established ML techniques and biological knowledge bases. One minor concern is that the proposal could more thoroughly address potential challenges in optimizing the complex architecture and ensuring that the knowledge integration doesn't overly constrain the model's ability to discover truly novel patterns."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and realistic implementation strategies. The use of publicly available datasets (TCGA, ICGC, etc.) and knowledge bases (GO, KEGG, etc.) makes data acquisition practical. The implementation leverages established libraries like PyTorch and specialized GNN libraries. However, there are several challenges that affect feasibility: (1) the complexity of integrating diverse knowledge sources into a unified framework, (2) the computational demands of training GNNs on large biological networks, (3) the need for domain expert involvement for qualitative evaluation, and (4) the challenge of balancing model flexibility with knowledge constraints. While these challenges don't make the project infeasible, they do increase its difficulty and risk. The timeline for completing all aspects of the proposed work (framework development, implementation for multiple tasks, comprehensive evaluation) might be ambitious depending on available resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical need in healthcare AI: developing models that not only predict accurately but also generate meaningful scientific insights. This directly aligns with the XAI4Science workshop's goal of using AI to discover new knowledge. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) Methodological impact through advancing ante-hoc interpretability approaches, (2) Scientific impact by facilitating deeper understanding of disease mechanisms, (3) Clinical impact through improved decision-making and precision medicine, and (4) Building trust in AI among biomedical researchers and clinicians. The approach could significantly accelerate biomedical discovery by guiding experimental research and generating testable hypotheses. The framework's potential generalizability to other scientific domains further enhances its significance. The proposal convincingly argues that this work could help bridge the gap between black-box predictive models and mechanistic understanding in biomedicine."
