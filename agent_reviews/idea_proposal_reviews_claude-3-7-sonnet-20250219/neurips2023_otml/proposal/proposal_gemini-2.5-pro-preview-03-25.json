        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the OTML workshop's focus on unbalanced OT formulations and applications to domain adaptation. The proposal builds upon the cited literature, particularly Fatras et al. (2021, 2022) and Rakotomamonjy et al. (2020), by addressing the key challenge of parameter selection in UOT for domain adaptation under label shift. The methodology is consistent with the research idea of developing an adaptive UOT framework that learns optimal relaxation parameters during training. The proposal comprehensively covers all aspects mentioned in the original idea while expanding on the technical details and implementation strategy."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction provides a comprehensive background on OT, UOT, and domain adaptation, establishing the context for the research. The research gap and objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section is detailed, with clear mathematical formulations of standard OT, UOT, and the proposed A-UOT framework. The algorithmic steps and experimental design are thoroughly explained. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for computing gradients with respect to Î¸ could be more explicitly detailed, (2) the implementation of the Sinkhorn-like algorithm for the UOT problem could be more thoroughly described, and (3) the proposal ends abruptly in the implementation details section, suggesting it might be incomplete."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to domain adaptation under label shift by introducing learnable relaxation parameters in UOT. While UOT itself is not new (as evidenced by the cited literature), the adaptive mechanism for automatically learning the optimal degree of marginal relaxation during end-to-end training represents a significant innovation. The approach differs from existing methods like Rakotomamonjy et al. (2020) that explicitly estimate target proportions, instead allowing the model to implicitly adapt to label shifts through the optimization process. However, the novelty is somewhat incremental rather than transformative, as it builds directly upon existing UOT frameworks and deep domain adaptation architectures. The core contribution lies in the parameterization and learning mechanism for the relaxation parameters, which is a valuable but focused advancement."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations of OT, UOT, and A-UOT are correct and well-presented. The learning mechanism for the relaxation parameters is theoretically justified through implicit differentiation or the envelope theorem. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. The proposal acknowledges computational challenges and provides a clear algorithmic approach. The connection between the learned relaxation parameters and the underlying label shift is well-reasoned. However, there are a few aspects that could be strengthened: (1) more detailed theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed method, (2) formal guarantees on the behavior of the learned parameters under different label shift scenarios, and (3) potential limitations or failure cases of the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed research is highly feasible with current technology and methods. The implementation builds upon established OT and UOT algorithms, particularly entropic regularization and Sinkhorn iterations, which are well-documented in the literature. The datasets suggested (Digits, Office-Caltech10, Office-Home, VisDA-2017) are standard benchmarks and readily available. The experimental design is comprehensive and realistic. The computational requirements, while potentially significant due to the OT calculations, are manageable with modern hardware. The gradient computation for the relaxation parameters might be challenging but is theoretically sound and implementable using automatic differentiation frameworks. The proposal also includes a clear step-by-step algorithm for implementation. The only potential challenges are the computational efficiency of the UOT solver in a deep learning loop and ensuring stable convergence of the joint optimization of network and relaxation parameters."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in domain adaptation: handling unknown label shifts without requiring explicit estimation of target label proportions. This is a practical challenge in many real-world applications where class distributions vary between domains. The proposed A-UOT framework has the potential to significantly improve the robustness and applicability of OT-based domain adaptation methods. The research contributes to both the theoretical understanding of adaptive regularization in OT and the practical deployment of domain adaptation systems. If successful, the approach could be extended to other OT applications beyond domain adaptation. The significance is enhanced by the comprehensive evaluation plan, which includes controlled experiments to assess performance under various label shift scenarios. The impact would be particularly notable in applications where collecting balanced target domain data is impractical or impossible."
