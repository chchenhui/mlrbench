        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, which specifically asks for applications of moral philosophy and psychology theories to AI practices. The proposal directly addresses the question 'What can theories of developmental moral psychology teach us about making AI?' by applying Kohlberg's stages of moral development to AI training. It also tackles the methodological question about alternatives to RLHF for teaching AI systems human values. The idea addresses pluralistic values and moral reasoning, which are central themes in the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly discuss how to incorporate diverse voices and values, though the staged approach could potentially accommodate this."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (static value alignment), proposes a solution (developmental scaffolding through moral stages), and outlines the implementation approach (curriculum learning with stage-appropriate training data). The progression from pre-conventional to post-conventional moral reasoning is well-explained. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific mechanisms for transitioning between stages, how progress would be evaluated, and concrete examples of the training data and reinforcement signals that would be used at each stage. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving the highest clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by applying developmental moral psychology theories to AI training, which represents a fresh perspective compared to current approaches like RLHF. While developmental approaches have been used in AI before, applying Kohlberg's specific moral development stages to value alignment is innovative. The staged curriculum for moral reasoning is a novel alternative to treating value alignment as a static process. The idea doesn't completely reinvent AI ethics (building on existing curriculum learning and psychological theories), but it combines these elements in a new way that could potentially transform how we approach value alignment in AI systems."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea faces moderate implementation challenges. While curriculum learning is an established technique in machine learning, operationalizing abstract moral concepts and stages into concrete training objectives presents significant difficulties. Creating appropriate simulated social interactions and ethical dilemmas of increasing complexity would require substantial effort. Measuring and validating progression through moral stages would be challenging, as would determining when an AI system has sufficiently mastered one stage to move to the next. The proposal doesn't address potential regression or conflicts between moral reasoning at different stages. These challenges make the idea somewhat feasible but with considerable implementation hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI alignment - how to develop AI systems with sophisticated moral reasoning capabilities. If successful, it could lead to AI systems with more nuanced, context-aware ethical decision-making, potentially reducing alignment failures in complex situations. The developmental approach might produce more robust moral reasoning than current methods, with greater adaptability across contexts. This would be valuable for high-stakes AI applications where ethical considerations are paramount. The significance is somewhat limited by implementation challenges and the need to validate whether human developmental stages are actually optimal for AI moral learning, but the potential impact on AI safety and alignment is substantial."
