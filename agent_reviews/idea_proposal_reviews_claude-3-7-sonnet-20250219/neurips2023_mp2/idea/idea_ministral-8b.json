    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses how theories from moral psychology (specifically Kohlberg's stages of moral development) can be applied to AI systems, which is a central theme requested in the workshop. The proposal tackles several key topics mentioned in the task description, including how developmental moral psychology can inform AI development, methodologies for teaching AI systems human values beyond RLHF, and considerations about embedding diverse human values in AI systems. The idea specifically responds to questions about how moral psychologists can contribute to ethical AI and alternative approaches to value alignment."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-step methodology (Stage Identification, Value Inculcation, and Evaluation) provides a solid framework for understanding the approach. However, there are some ambiguities that prevent a higher score. For instance, the proposal doesn't clearly explain how Kohlberg's stages would be operationalized in AI systems or what specific reinforcement learning techniques would be used for value inculcation. The evaluation metrics for assessing moral reasoning in AI systems are also not fully specified. These details would be necessary for complete understanding and implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates strong originality by applying established theories of moral development from psychology to AI systems in a structured way. While both moral psychology and AI ethics are established fields, their integration through Kohlberg's developmental framework represents a fresh approach. The stage-based implementation of moral reasoning in AI systems offers a novel perspective compared to most current approaches that tend to implement static ethical frameworks. The proposal goes beyond simply embedding ethical rules and instead considers the developmental nature of moral reasoning, which is innovative in the AI ethics landscape. However, it builds upon existing work in AI alignment rather than proposing a completely revolutionary paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate implementation challenges. While the conceptual framework is sound, translating Kohlberg's abstract moral stages into computational models presents significant technical hurdles. The proposal doesn't address how abstract moral concepts would be operationalized in machine learning systems or how the AI would progress through developmental stages. Additionally, evaluating moral reasoning in AI systems is notoriously difficult and subjective. The reinforcement learning approach mentioned would require carefully designed reward functions that capture nuanced moral principles, which is a complex challenge. The research is feasible but would require substantial methodological development beyond what's outlined in the proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical problem in AI ethics - how to develop systems that align with human moral values in a psychologically grounded way. The significance is high because it could bridge an important gap between abstract ethical principles and practical AI implementation. If successful, this approach could lead to AI systems that reason about ethics in ways more aligned with human moral psychology, potentially improving trust and acceptance. The developmental approach could also help address the challenge of moral pluralism by acknowledging different stages of moral reasoning. The impact would extend across multiple domains where ethical AI decision-making is crucial, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles, making this research broadly significant."
