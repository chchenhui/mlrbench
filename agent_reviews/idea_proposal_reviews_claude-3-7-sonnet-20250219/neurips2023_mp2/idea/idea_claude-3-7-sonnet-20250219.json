        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the topic of applying moral philosophy theories to AI practices, specifically focusing on pluralistic value alignment. The proposal explicitly tackles the question 'How can we incorporate diverse voices, views and values into AI systems?' which is listed as a key topic in the task description. It also addresses concerns about current AI alignment potentially amplifying monolithic voices, which is another specified topic. The idea explores alternatives to current alignment methods by proposing a multi-framework ethical architecture, which relates to the task's interest in competitors to RLHF. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly discuss how moral philosophers and psychologists would contribute to the development process, though this is implied."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (monolithic value systems in current AI), proposes a specific solution (multi-framework ethical architecture incorporating various ethical theories), and outlines a three-part approach to implementation (identifying conflicts, representing trade-offs, and allowing context-dependent prioritization). The evaluation method through case studies with diverse cultural groups is also well-defined. The only aspects that could benefit from further elaboration are the specific technical mechanisms for implementing the multi-framework architecture and more details on how the context-dependent prioritization would work in practice. Despite these minor ambiguities, the overall concept is well-articulated and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in the AI alignment space. While ethical pluralism is an established concept in philosophy, its systematic application to AI systems through a multi-framework architecture represents a fresh approach. Most current AI alignment efforts focus on either value learning from human feedback or alignment to specific ethical frameworks, whereas this proposal explicitly embraces moral disagreement as a feature rather than a bug. The simultaneous reasoning through multiple ethical theories (consequentialist, deontological, virtue ethics, and care ethics) is particularly innovative. The idea isn't entirely without precedent—some researchers have proposed incorporating multiple ethical frameworks—but the specific approach to transparent representation of trade-offs and context-dependent prioritization offers a novel contribution to the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several challenges. While representing different ethical frameworks is conceptually sound, operationalizing diverse moral theories into computational systems is notoriously difficult. Each framework (consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics, care ethics) has internal complexities and variations that would be challenging to formalize. The proposal to identify conflicts between frameworks is reasonable, but developing mechanisms for transparent representation of trade-offs and context-dependent prioritization would require significant technical innovation. The evaluation through case studies with diverse cultural groups is practical, though ensuring representative diversity would be resource-intensive. The idea doesn't address how to handle fundamental incompatibilities between ethical frameworks or how to prevent manipulation of the system by selecting convenient ethical frameworks. While challenging, the core components are not impossible with current technology, making it somewhat feasible but requiring substantial research effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in current AI alignment approaches and could have far-reaching implications. As AI systems become more integrated into global decision-making processes, the ability to represent diverse moral perspectives is essential for creating truly inclusive technology. The significance is particularly high because current alignment methods risk embedding and amplifying dominant cultural perspectives, potentially marginalizing alternative value systems. If successful, this approach could fundamentally shift how we think about AI alignment—moving from seeking consensus on 'correct' values to creating systems that can navigate moral complexity and disagreement. This would be valuable not only for AI development but could also contribute to broader discussions in applied ethics and cross-cultural moral philosophy. The potential impact extends beyond technical AI safety to questions of global technological governance and ethical pluralism in digital systems."
