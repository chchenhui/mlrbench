    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the application of moral psychology theories (specifically Kohlberg's stages) to AI development as requested in the task. The proposal elaborates comprehensively on the initial idea of developmental scaffolding for moral AI, maintaining the core concept while adding substantial methodological details. It incorporates relevant literature, particularly building on works about moral development in AI, inverse reinforcement learning for value learning, and curriculum approaches. The proposal addresses most of the topics mentioned in the task description, including how developmental moral psychology can inform AI development, methodological alternatives to RLHF, and incorporating diverse values. The only minor gap is that it could have more explicitly addressed the question of whose values are being aligned to, though it does mention cross-cultural considerations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, evaluation, and expected outcomes. The research goals are explicitly stated, and the four-stage curriculum is thoroughly explained with specific data sources, reward functions, and transition criteria for each stage. The algorithmic workflow is presented in pseudocode, making the implementation approach transparent. Mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined. The timeline and evaluation metrics are clearly specified. The only minor issues affecting clarity are: (1) some technical details about the composite reward function R3 could be more elaborated, and (2) the relationship between the cultural adaptation in Stage 4 and the earlier stages could be more explicitly connected. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant originality by applying developmental psychology principles to AI moral learning in a structured, stage-based curriculum. While the literature review shows that others have explored developmental approaches to AI ethics, this proposal innovates by formalizing a complete four-stage curriculum with distinct MDPs and reward functions for each stage. The integration of different learning paradigms (rule-based learning, IRL, composite rewards, and meta-learning) across developmental stages is particularly novel. The progression criteria between stages and the explicit modeling of cultural variability in the final stage represent fresh approaches to the problem. The proposal doesn't completely reinvent the field—it builds on existing concepts like RLHF, IRL, and developmental psychology—but it combines and extends these in innovative ways that clearly differentiate it from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations from both developmental psychology and reinforcement learning. The mathematical formulations for reward functions and policy optimization are technically correct. The stage-based curriculum is well-justified by Kohlberg's theory, and the transition between stages follows a logical progression. The evaluation methodology includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and statistical analyses. However, there are some areas where the theoretical foundations could be strengthened: (1) the proposal assumes that Kohlberg's stages can be directly mapped to AI learning processes without fully addressing potential limitations of this mapping; (2) the composite reward function for Stage 3 needs more theoretical justification for how abstract principles are encoded and balanced; (3) the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential failure modes or theoretical limitations of the approach. Despite these concerns, the overall methodology is rigorous and well-founded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach but faces several implementation challenges. The timeline of 12 months seems ambitious given the complexity of the project. Each stage requires different types of data, some of which may be difficult to collect or generate (especially culturally diverse human behavior logs and expert annotations of abstract ethical principles). The IRL components for Stages 2 and 4 are computationally intensive and may require significant resources. The progression criteria between stages need careful calibration to ensure meaningful learning. The hardware requirements (16 GPUs) are substantial but reasonable for this type of research. The proposal acknowledges these challenges implicitly but could benefit from more explicit risk mitigation strategies. While challenging, the project appears implementable with sufficient resources and expertise, though it may require timeline adjustments or scope refinements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in AI alignment research by offering a developmental approach to moral learning that could potentially lead to more robust, adaptable, and transparent AI systems. If successful, this work could significantly impact how we approach value alignment in AI, moving beyond monolithic training methods to more nuanced, stage-based approaches. The cross-cultural considerations and explicit modeling of diverse value systems are particularly important contributions to the field. The proposal has both theoretical significance (formalizing developmental moral learning in AI) and practical applications (potentially more trustworthy and culturally sensitive AI systems). The broader impacts section convincingly argues for how this approach could improve AI trustworthiness, cross-cultural fairness, and ethical standards. The long-term vision of AI systems that undergo moral development analogous to human learning is compelling and addresses important societal concerns about AI alignment."
