    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of applying moral philosophy and psychology theories to AI practices, specifically focusing on developmental moral psychology as suggested in the idea. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, including Kohlberg's moral development stages, inverse reinforcement learning approaches (Oliveira et al.), developmental support frameworks (Endo), and hybrid approaches (Tennant et al.). The methodology clearly operationalizes the staged developmental approach mentioned in the idea, with concrete implementations of pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional stages. The proposal also addresses several topics explicitly mentioned in the task description, including alternatives to RLHF, pluralistic values in AI, and methodologies for teaching AI systems human values."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the algorithmic framework, including formal mathematical representations of the reward functions for each developmental stage. The experimental design, including baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies, is comprehensively outlined. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as the specific mechanisms for transitioning between stages and more detailed explanations of how the cultural adaptation will be implemented across different stages. Additionally, while the mathematical formulations are precise, some readers might find them challenging to follow without additional context or examples."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly original approach to AI alignment by systematically operationalizing developmental moral psychology theories into a computational framework. While individual elements like hierarchical reinforcement learning and stage-based learning exist in the literature, the integration of these techniques with Kohlberg's moral development theory represents a novel contribution. The staged curriculum with progressively complex moral reasoning tasks and corresponding reward functions is particularly innovative. The proposal also introduces new evaluation metrics like Moral Stage Accuracy and Cultural Consistency Index that are specifically designed for assessing developmental moral reasoning in AI. The approach of treating moral development as a dynamic, iterative process rather than a static optimization problem represents a significant departure from conventional RLHF methods and addresses a gap identified in the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations by drawing from established theories in developmental psychology and reinforcement learning. The mathematical formulations for the reward functions at each stage are technically sound and build logically upon each other. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved. For instance, the proposal does not fully address potential challenges in the transition between stages, such as catastrophic forgetting or conflicting reward signals. Additionally, while the Cultural Consistency Index is proposed as an evaluation metric, the methodology for ensuring cultural adaptability across different moral frameworks could be more thoroughly justified. The proposal also makes some assumptions about the effectiveness of the staged approach without providing preliminary evidence or theoretical guarantees."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a technically implementable approach using existing frameworks like PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers. The data collection strategy and algorithmic framework are described in sufficient detail to be actionable. However, several feasibility concerns arise: 1) The complexity of simulating social environments with sufficient fidelity to teach conventional and post-conventional moral reasoning may require resources beyond what's implied; 2) The creation of culturally diverse datasets with appropriate annotations for moral reasoning stages presents significant challenges; 3) The proposal requires human judgment via Amazon Mechanical Turk for evaluation, which may introduce scalability issues and potential biases; 4) The integration of pre-trained BERT models for norm compliance scoring would require substantial validation to ensure they accurately represent sociocultural norms. While the overall approach is feasible, these implementation challenges suggest that significant refinement and resource allocation would be necessary for successful execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI alignment approaches by moving beyond static optimization toward developmental models that mirror human cognitive growth. If successful, this research could significantly impact how AI systems learn and apply ethical reasoning, potentially leading to more robust, adaptable, and culturally sensitive AI. The anticipated improvements in cross-cultural adaptability (CCI ≥ 0.90 for ≥80% of non-WEIRD clusters) and generalization to novel scenarios (30% higher accuracy on the ETHICS suite) would represent meaningful advances in AI alignment. The proposal also has broader implications for AI ethics, offering a framework that could inform regulatory approaches and guide the development of AI systems in sensitive domains like healthcare and legal assistance. The interdisciplinary nature of the work, bridging moral psychology and AI, aligns well with emerging research directions and could foster valuable collaborations between these fields."
