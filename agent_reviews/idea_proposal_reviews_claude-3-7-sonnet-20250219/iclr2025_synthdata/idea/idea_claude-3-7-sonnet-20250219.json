    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the core question of whether synthetic data can solve data access problems, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. The proposal specifically tackles privacy concerns (a key topic of interest in the task) and presents a framework that balances privacy protection with data utility. The idea incorporates differential privacy guarantees, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest in the task description. The framework also addresses evaluation of synthetic data quality, another listed topic. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly discuss mixing synthetic and natural data, though this could be implied in the adaptive approach."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (privacy-utility trade-off in synthetic data), proposes a specific solution (two-phase approach with adaptive privacy mechanisms), and outlines the expected benefits. The framework components are described with sufficient detail - including domain-specific risk assessment, multi-level generative models, and privacy budgeting. However, some technical aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific implementation of the 'multi-level generative model' and how exactly the 'privacy verification mechanisms' work. The preliminary results are mentioned but not detailed, which is understandable for a research proposal but slightly reduces clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining several existing concepts in a new way. The adaptive approach to applying different privacy preservation strengths to different data components is innovative, as is the integration of privacy budgeting that allows organizations to control the privacy-utility balance. However, both differential privacy and synthetic data generation are established research areas, and the core components of the framework build upon existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methods. The novelty lies primarily in the adaptive calibration and the domain-specific risk assessment integration, which represents an incremental but meaningful advancement rather than a revolutionary approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology and methods. Differential privacy techniques are well-established, and generative models for synthetic data have matured significantly. The mention of preliminary experiments in healthcare datasets suggests that initial implementation has already begun, which strengthens feasibility. The two-phase approach is practical and implementable. The adaptive mechanism might present some implementation challenges, particularly in accurately measuring and optimizing the privacy-utility trade-off in real-time, but these challenges seem surmountable with existing techniques. The domain-specific nature of the approach may require customization for different fields, but the overall framework appears technically viable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical problem in machine learning: accessing high-quality data while respecting privacy concerns. The significance is particularly high because it targets sensitive domains like healthcare and finance where data access is severely limited by regulations, yet the potential benefits of ML applications are enormous. By providing a framework that offers mathematical privacy guarantees while maintaining data utility, this research could enable organizations to leverage sensitive data that would otherwise remain inaccessible. The adaptive approach that allows customization of privacy-utility trade-offs for specific use cases enhances its practical impact. If successful, this work could significantly advance the use of ML in regulated industries and contribute to solving the data access problem identified in the task description."
