    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central question about synthetic data solving the data access problem by proposing a targeted approach that leverages model uncertainty to guide synthetic data generation. The methodology clearly builds upon the active learning-inspired framework outlined in the research idea, and incorporates concepts from the literature review such as uncertainty-driven data augmentation and targeted data synthesis. The proposal covers multiple topics of interest mentioned in the task description, including new algorithms for synthetic data generation, mixing synthetic and natural data, and fine-grained control of synthetic data generation. The mathematical formulations and evaluation metrics are consistent with the active synthesis approach described in the idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The algorithmic steps are precisely defined with mathematical formulations, making the approach easy to understand. The evaluation metrics are well-specified and directly tied to the research objectives. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the specific uncertainty estimation methods could be elaborated further, (2) the details of how the conditional generative model will be guided by uncertainty maps could be more explicit, and (3) the stopping criteria for the iterative process could be more clearly defined. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining active learning principles with synthetic data generation in a novel way. The concept of using model uncertainty to guide targeted synthetic data generation represents a fresh perspective compared to traditional approaches that generate synthetic data without considering model weaknesses. The iterative feedback loop between uncertainty estimation and synthetic data generation is innovative. However, as indicated in the literature review, similar concepts have been explored in recent papers such as 'Active Synthesis: Bridging Active Learning and Data Augmentation' and 'Uncertainty-Driven Data Augmentation for Deep Learning.' While the proposal builds upon these existing ideas, it does offer a more comprehensive framework and specific algorithmic steps that distinguish it from prior work. The novelty lies more in the integration and application of these concepts rather than introducing entirely new paradigms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established machine learning principles. The methodology is rigorous, with clearly defined algorithmic steps and mathematical formulations. The approach builds logically on active learning and uncertainty estimation techniques, which have strong theoretical foundations. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and appropriate for assessing the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, demonstrating awareness of technical considerations. The iterative process for model improvement is well-justified and follows sound machine learning practices. There are some minor areas where additional theoretical justification could strengthen the proposal, such as explaining why the combination of real and synthetic data would be more effective than other approaches, but overall, the technical foundations are solid and well-presented."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technologies and methodologies. The components required for implementation—uncertainty estimation, conditional generative models, and model training—are all established techniques with available tools and frameworks. The algorithmic steps are clearly defined and implementable. However, there are some practical challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) the computational resources required for iterative model training and synthetic data generation could be substantial, (2) the quality of synthetic data generated based on uncertainty maps may vary depending on the domain and task, and (3) the integration of uncertainty estimation with generative models might require significant engineering effort. The proposal acknowledges computational complexity as an evaluation metric but could benefit from more detailed discussion of resource requirements and potential optimizations. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is feasible with current technology and reasonable resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in machine learning: the need for large-scale, high-quality data while respecting privacy, fairness, and ethical concerns. The active synthesis framework has the potential to make substantial contributions to the field by improving model performance with less real data, enhancing robustness, and democratizing machine learning for organizations with limited data access. The approach directly addresses several key challenges identified in the task description and literature review. The expected outcomes—improved model performance, enhanced robustness, data efficiency, and scalability—would have meaningful impact across various applications of machine learning. The proposal also acknowledges ethical considerations related to synthetic data generation, which is increasingly important in responsible AI development. The significance is further enhanced by the potential applicability of this approach across different domains and model architectures."
