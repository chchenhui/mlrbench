    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on synthetic data for machine learning by proposing a novel 'Active Synthesis' framework that targets the generation of synthetic data based on model uncertainty. The proposal incorporates key elements from the literature review, including uncertainty-driven data generation, active learning principles, and the integration of generative models. It also addresses several topics of interest mentioned in the task description, such as new algorithms for synthetic data generation, mixing synthetic and natural data, and fine-grained control of synthetic data generation. The methodology section clearly builds upon the cited works while addressing the identified gaps in the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, related work, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate mathematical notation. The experimental design is comprehensive, including datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The only minor issues preventing a perfect score are: (1) some technical details in the prompt construction section could be more specific about how exactly the features of uncertain regions are extracted and encoded, and (2) the filtering step could benefit from more concrete criteria for what constitutes 'low uncertainty' or an acceptable class-label consistency score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing an end-to-end 'Active Synthesis Loop' that combines uncertainty estimation, conditional generation, and iterative retraining. While individual components (uncertainty estimation, synthetic data generation) exist in prior work as noted in the literature review, the proposal innovates by creating a unified algorithmic template and applying it at scale to real-world benchmarks. The approach of using model uncertainty to guide synthetic data generation is not entirely new (as seen in works by Patel & Liu and Chen & Zhao), but the proposal extends these ideas significantly with a more comprehensive framework and broader application scope. The novelty lies more in the integration and application rather than in fundamentally new theoretical concepts."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established methods from active learning, uncertainty quantification, and generative modeling. The mathematical formulations for uncertainty estimation (ensemble variance and predictive entropy) are correct and clearly presented. The methodology follows a logical progression from uncertainty estimation to synthetic data generation and model retraining. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The only aspects that could be strengthened are: (1) more detailed discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach, and (2) clearer justification for some design choices, such as the specific filtering threshold Ï„ or the number of synthetic samples L per prototype."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The components required (uncertainty estimation, conditional generative models, model training) are all well-established techniques with available implementations. The experimental design is realistic, with appropriate datasets and evaluation metrics. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require additional resources or refinement: (1) the computational cost of training ensembles and running large generative models repeatedly could be substantial, (2) creating effective conditioning prompts for generative models in complex domains might require significant engineering effort, and (3) the filtering step to ensure quality synthetic samples may need careful tuning. The proposal acknowledges the need for substantial computing resources, which is realistic but does represent a practical constraint."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in machine learning: how to efficiently leverage synthetic data to improve model performance when real data is limited or sensitive. The expected outcomes include achieving equal or better performance with 20-50% fewer real examples, which would be a significant advancement in data efficiency. The broader impacts on data access, privacy preservation, fairness, and generalizability are well-articulated and compelling. The approach could be particularly valuable in domains with data scarcity or privacy concerns, such as healthcare. The long-term vision of models that 'self-diagnose their weaknesses and request synthetic experiences' represents a potentially transformative shift in how data is collected and used for AI training. While not completely revolutionary, the significance is high due to the practical importance of the problem and the potential for wide applicability across domains."
