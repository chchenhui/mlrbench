        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central question about synthetic data solving data access problems by proposing Active Synthesis as a targeted approach. The framework incorporates model uncertainty to guide synthetic data generation, exactly as outlined in the research idea. The proposal thoroughly integrates concepts from the literature review, citing relevant works on uncertainty-driven data generation and active learning with synthetic data. It maintains consistency throughout all sections, from the problem statement to methodology and expected outcomes, creating a cohesive narrative that builds upon the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The Active Synthesis framework is explained in detail with mathematical formulations and step-by-step procedures. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the experimental design is comprehensive. The writing is generally precise and technical terms are well-defined. However, some parts of the methodology section, particularly the conditioning mechanism explanations, could benefit from more concrete examples to improve clarity for readers less familiar with generative models. Additionally, while the overall flow is logical, the extensive technical detail in some sections might slightly impede readability for non-specialists."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of active learning principles with synthetic data generation in a closed-loop system. While individual components (uncertainty estimation, synthetic data generation) exist in prior work as noted in the literature review, the Active Synthesis framework offers innovation through its iterative, targeted approach that directly links model weaknesses to data generation. The proposal acknowledges related work while clearly articulating its unique contributions, particularly the focus on efficiency and the explicit use of real data signals to guide synthesis. However, the core idea builds upon existing concepts in active learning and uncertainty-guided data generation rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques, which somewhat limits its groundbreaking nature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The Active Synthesis framework is well-grounded in established machine learning principles, with clear mathematical formulations for each component. The uncertainty estimation techniques (ensembles, MC Dropout) are based on sound statistical principles, and the experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and includes strategies to address them. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, covering both performance and robustness metrics. While the approach is generally well-justified, some assumptions about how uncertainty signals will effectively translate to generator conditioning could benefit from more theoretical validation, and the potential limitations of the generative models themselves could be more thoroughly addressed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines an implementable research plan with existing technologies and methods. The components required (uncertainty estimation, generative models, model training) are all established techniques with available implementations. The experimental design is realistic, using standard datasets and evaluation metrics. However, there are several practical challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) The computational resources required for multiple iterations of model training, uncertainty estimation (especially with ensembles), and generative model inference could be substantial; (2) Effectively translating uncertainty signals into appropriate generator conditioning is non-trivial and may require significant experimentation; (3) The quality of synthetic data will depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying generative models, which may vary across domains. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do introduce implementation complexities that could affect the timeline and scope."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in machine learning: data access limitations. By offering a more efficient and targeted approach to synthetic data generation, Active Synthesis has the potential to significantly impact domains where data is scarce, sensitive, or expensive to collect (e.g., healthcare, finance). The research directly contributes to the workshop's theme by providing a nuanced perspective on how synthetic data can help solve data access problems. If successful, the approach could improve model robustness and reliability while reducing the amount of real data needed, which has broad implications for ML applications. The potential for open-source implementation further enhances its impact by enabling community adoption. While the significance is high, it stops short of being transformative as it represents an evolution rather than a revolution in how synthetic data is utilized."
