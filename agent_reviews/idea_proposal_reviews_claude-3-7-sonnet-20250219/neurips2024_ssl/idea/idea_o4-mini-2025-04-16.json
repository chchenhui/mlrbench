        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The MetaSSL idea aligns excellently with the task description, which specifically calls for research on 'theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks in SSL' and 'comparative analysis of different auxiliary tasks.' The proposal directly addresses a key question mentioned in the task: 'the reasons behind the superior performance of certain auxiliary tasks.' The idea combines theoretical foundations (sample complexity bounds) with practical implementations across multiple domains (vision, text, time-series), which perfectly matches the workshop's aim to 'foster dialogue between theory and practice.' The only minor limitation is that while it touches on sample complexity (a requested topic), it could more explicitly address some of the other theoretical foundations mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a well-defined bilevel meta-learning framework with clear inner and outer loops. The parameterization of auxiliary tasks via a controller network is well-explained, as is the evaluation mechanism. The theoretical contribution (sample complexity bounds) is mentioned, though it could benefit from slightly more elaboration on the specific mathematical approach. The empirical claims are clear but would be strengthened with more specific details about implementation across the different modalities mentioned. Overall, the core concept is immediately understandable with only minor ambiguities around the theoretical derivations and specific implementation details."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in automating the discovery of auxiliary tasks for SSL, which traditionally relies on manual design and domain expertise. The meta-learning approach to parameterize and optimize these tasks represents a fresh perspective on SSL methodology. While meta-learning itself is not new, its application to discover optimal SSL pretext tasks appears innovative. The theoretical contribution regarding sample complexity bounds for adaptive task selection also adds originality. The approach doesn't completely reinvent SSL but rather introduces a novel framework for optimizing an existing paradigm. The combination of theoretical guarantees with practical implementation across multiple domains further enhances its innovative nature."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed MetaSSL framework is feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The bilevel optimization structure is well-established in meta-learning literature, making the overall approach technically viable. However, several practical challenges exist: (1) The computational cost of the nested optimization loops could be substantial, especially for large-scale datasets; (2) Designing a sufficiently expressive yet trainable parameterization for the space of possible auxiliary tasks is non-trivial; (3) The approach requires a small labeled or proxy validation set, which might limit its applicability in some domains. The claim of state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains would require significant engineering and experimental validation. Overall, the idea is implementable with current technology but would require considerable computational resources and careful design choices."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research idea is very high as it addresses a fundamental limitation in current SSL approaches - the manual and often suboptimal design of auxiliary tasks. Automating this process could substantially advance the field by: (1) Reducing the reliance on domain expertise, making SSL more accessible; (2) Potentially improving performance by discovering more optimal tasks than human-designed ones; (3) Providing theoretical insights into what makes effective pretext tasks, addressing a key question highlighted in the task description; (4) Enhancing sample efficiency of SSL, which is crucial for domains with limited data. If successful, this approach could influence how SSL is applied across numerous domains and contribute to both theoretical understanding and practical applications of self-supervised learning."
