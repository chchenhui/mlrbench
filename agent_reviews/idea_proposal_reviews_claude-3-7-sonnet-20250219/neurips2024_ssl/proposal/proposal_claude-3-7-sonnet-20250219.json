        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the gap identified in the task description regarding the lack of theoretical underpinnings in SSL by proposing a principled framework based on information disentanglement. The proposal fully embraces the core idea of separating 'invariant' information from 'variant' information using mutual information objectives. It builds upon the literature review by incorporating concepts from papers on disentangled representations, mutual information estimation, and information-theoretic approaches to SSL. The methodology section clearly outlines how the theoretical framework will be implemented and evaluated, addressing the key challenges identified in the literature review. The proposal also covers the suggested topics from the task description, including theoretical foundations of SSL, information theory and SSL, and theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from theoretical foundations to practical implementations and experimental validation. The introduction effectively establishes the context and significance of the research. The methodology section is particularly strong, with clear mathematical formulations of the information disentanglement objectives and detailed descriptions of how these will be implemented in practice. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive, specifying datasets, metrics, and baseline comparisons. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the four proposed auxiliary tasks could be more explicitly compared, (2) some technical details about the implementation of the adversarial training for minimizing I(z_i; n_i) could be elaborated further, and (3) the definition of nuisance variables n_i could be more precisely specified in practical contexts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel theoretical framework for SSL based on information disentanglement principles. While individual components like mutual information maximization and disentanglement have been explored in the literature, the comprehensive integration of these concepts specifically for auxiliary task design in SSL represents a significant innovation. The four proposed auxiliary tasks (DCL, IB-SSL, MVD, and TSD) offer fresh perspectives on how to implement the theoretical framework in practice. Particularly novel is the Task-Specific Disentanglement (TSD) approach, which incorporates knowledge about downstream tasks to guide the disentanglement process. The proposal also innovatively bridges multiple research areas (information theory, representation learning, and SSL) in a cohesive framework. However, some aspects, such as the use of InfoNCE for mutual information estimation, build directly on existing approaches rather than introducing entirely new methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness in its theoretical formulations and methodology. The information-theoretic framework is mathematically rigorous, with clear objectives for maximizing mutual information between representations of different views while minimizing mutual information with nuisance variables. The practical implementations of these objectives using established techniques like InfoNCE, non-contrastive estimators, and adversarial training are well-justified. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive, covering multiple data modalities, architectures, and evaluation metrics. The proposal also acknowledges the challenges in directly optimizing mutual information and provides practical approximations. However, there are some potential theoretical concerns: (1) the assumption that nuisance variables can be clearly identified and separated may not always hold in practice, (2) the relationship between the proposed information disentanglement objectives and downstream task performance could be more rigorously established, and (3) the theoretical analysis of sample complexity is mentioned but not fully developed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and methodologies. The implementation of the theoretical framework using established techniques like InfoNCE and adversarial training is practical and achievable. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive but realistic, covering multiple datasets and modalities while using standard architectures and training procedures. The proposal also acknowledges computational requirements and suggests using multi-GPU setups with mixed-precision training for efficiency. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the optimization of multiple mutual information objectives simultaneously may be challenging and require careful balancing, (2) the adversarial training component for minimizing I(z_i; n_i) might introduce training instabilities, (3) the comprehensive evaluation across multiple data modalities (images, text, graphs, time-series) is ambitious and may require significant computational resources, and (4) the identification and modeling of nuisance variables in complex real-world datasets might be difficult in practice."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental gap in SSL research: the lack of principled theoretical frameworks for auxiliary task design. This is a significant contribution that could transform how SSL methods are developed and understood. The potential impact spans multiple dimensions: (1) theoretical advances in understanding why certain SSL approaches work, (2) methodological innovations in designing more effective auxiliary tasks, (3) practical improvements in representation quality for downstream applications, and (4) broader impacts on fields like healthcare, fairness in AI, and resource-efficient learning. The proposal's emphasis on connecting theory and practice aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals and could lead to more principled, efficient, and effective SSL methods. The framework's applicability across different data modalities further enhances its significance. The research could also contribute to interdisciplinary connections between information theory, representation learning, and cognitive science, potentially yielding insights into how humans learn from unlabeled data."
