    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for theoretical foundations in SSL as highlighted in the task description, focusing specifically on the theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks. The proposal faithfully implements the core idea of information disentanglement through mutual information objectives, separating invariant from variant information. The mathematical formulation clearly operationalizes the mutual information maximization and minimization objectives outlined in the idea. The proposal also incorporates relevant concepts from the literature review, particularly drawing on papers about disentangled representations, mutual information estimation, and information-theoretic approaches to SSL. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions challenges with multimodal data, the proposal doesn't explicitly address multimodal scenarios in its methodology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a comprehensive overview of the research design, data collection approach, algorithmic steps, and mathematical formulation. The mathematical formulation is particularly well-presented, with clear equations for the mutual information objectives and the overall loss function. The experimental design outlines specific evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific data augmentation techniques could be more thoroughly described, (2) the definition of 'view-specific nuisance variables' could be more precisely explained, and (3) the hyperparameter λ's tuning strategy is not discussed. Despite these minor issues, the proposal is generally clear and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by developing a principled framework for designing SSL auxiliary tasks based on information disentanglement. While the concept of using mutual information for representation learning is not entirely new (as evidenced by the literature review), the proposal offers a fresh perspective by explicitly focusing on the disentanglement of invariant and variant information through a combination of mutual information maximization and minimization objectives. The derivation of novel contrastive and non-contrastive loss functions based on this principle represents an innovative contribution. However, the proposal shares similarities with existing approaches in the literature, particularly those focusing on mutual information estimation and disentangled representations. The novelty lies more in the systematic integration of these concepts into a cohesive framework specifically for auxiliary task design rather than in introducing entirely new concepts."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in information theory. The mathematical formulation of mutual information objectives is correct and appropriately applied to the problem of representation learning. The research design follows a logical progression from theoretical development to implementation and empirical evaluation. The proposed methodology is rigorous, with clear algorithmic steps and evaluation metrics. The connection between the theoretical framework and practical implementation is well-established. The proposal also acknowledges the importance of empirical validation on benchmark datasets, which strengthens its soundness. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) the estimation of mutual information in high-dimensional spaces is known to be challenging, but the proposal doesn't address potential estimation issues, (2) the theoretical guarantees for the proposed approach are not fully elaborated, and (3) the potential limitations of the approach are not thoroughly discussed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The research objectives are achievable within a reasonable timeframe, and the proposed methodology uses established techniques in self-supervised learning and information theory. The data collection approach relies on publicly available datasets, which makes it practical. The algorithmic steps are clearly defined and implementable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) estimating mutual information in high-dimensional spaces can be computationally expensive and potentially unstable, (2) balancing the mutual information maximization and minimization objectives may require careful tuning of the hyperparameter λ, which could be time-consuming, and (3) the proposal doesn't specify the computational resources required for the experiments, which could be substantial for large-scale datasets. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is feasible with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant gap in the field of self-supervised learning: the lack of theoretical foundations for designing auxiliary tasks. By developing a principled framework based on information disentanglement, the research has the potential to advance our understanding of why certain SSL methods succeed and guide the design of more effective auxiliary tasks. The expected outcomes include both theoretical contributions (framework and loss functions) and practical insights (tailored auxiliary tasks for specific requirements), which could benefit researchers and practitioners in the field. The proposal aligns well with the workshop's goal of fostering dialogue between theory and practice in SSL. The significance is enhanced by the potential applications across various domains and data modalities. However, the impact might be somewhat limited by the focus on a specific aspect of SSL (auxiliary task design) rather than addressing broader challenges in the field. Nevertheless, the potential contributions to both theoretical understanding and practical applications make this research highly significant."
