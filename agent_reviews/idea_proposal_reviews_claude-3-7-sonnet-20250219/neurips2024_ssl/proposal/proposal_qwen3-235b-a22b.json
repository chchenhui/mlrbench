    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the gap identified in the task description regarding the lack of theoretical underpinnings for SSL by proposing a theory-driven framework based on information disentanglement. The proposal follows the research idea closely, developing the concept of separating 'invariant' from 'variant' information using mutual information objectives. The literature review is well-integrated, with clear connections to works like DisentangledSSL (2024) and other papers on mutual information-based approaches. The methodology section thoroughly develops the mathematical formulation outlined in the idea, and the evaluation metrics address the practical performance concerns mentioned in both the task description and idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and conclusion. The theoretical framework is presented with precise mathematical formulations, defining the mutual information objectives and how they translate into practical loss functions (DCL and NC-Disentangled). The experimental design is comprehensive, detailing datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for extracting variant components v1 and v2 could be more explicitly defined, (2) the relationship between the theoretical framework and the specific loss functions could be more thoroughly explained, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the mutual information estimators are not fully specified."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by formalizing SSL as an information disentanglement problem and developing a unified MI objective that jointly maximizes shared information while suppressing view-specific biases. The extension of InfoNCE with explicit disentanglement (DCL) and the adaptation of Barlow Twins for non-contrastive disentanglement (NC-Disentangled) represent innovative contributions. However, the core idea of using mutual information for representation learning in SSL is not entirely new, as evidenced by several papers in the literature review (e.g., papers from 2019, 2023, 2024). The proposal builds incrementally on these existing approaches rather than introducing a completely novel paradigm. The modality-agnostic formulation is a fresh perspective, but the fundamental theoretical framework shares similarities with existing information-theoretic approaches to SSL."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations, grounding the approach in information theory and mutual information principles. The mathematical formulation is rigorous, with clear definitions of the shared and variant components and how they relate to the overall representation. The dual objective of maximizing MI between shared features while minimizing MI between variant features is well-justified. The extension to both contrastive and non-contrastive loss functions shows methodological breadth. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that directly assess the claims made. However, there are some areas that could be strengthened: (1) the theoretical guarantees or bounds on the performance of the proposed approach are not fully developed, (2) the assumptions underlying the disentanglement approach could be more explicitly stated and justified, and (3) potential limitations of the mutual information estimation in high-dimensional spaces are not thoroughly addressed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The implementation builds on established SSL frameworks (contrastive and non-contrastive approaches) and uses standard architectures (ViT-B, BERT). The evaluation metrics and datasets are well-defined and accessible. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) accurate estimation of mutual information in high-dimensional spaces is notoriously difficult and may require sophisticated approximation techniques not fully detailed in the proposal, (2) the computational resources required for training across multiple modalities (vision, language, multimodal) could be substantial, (3) the disentanglement of variant and invariant features might be more challenging in practice than in theory, especially for complex data types. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but could provide more detailed strategies for addressing them."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in SSL research - the lack of theoretical understanding of why certain auxiliary tasks yield superior representations. By providing a principled framework for auxiliary task design, it has the potential to significantly impact both theoretical understanding and practical applications of SSL. The expected outcomes include both theoretical insights (novel bounds on sample complexity) and practical advancements (improved robustness and accuracy). The cross-modal applicability enhances its significance, potentially benefiting diverse domains from healthcare to environmental sciences. The explicit connection between theory and practice is particularly valuable, as it could guide the development of more effective SSL methods for specific domains or constraints. The focus on disentanglement also has implications for fairness and bias mitigation, addressing important ethical considerations in AI development."
