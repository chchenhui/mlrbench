        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on computational modeling of Theory of Mind (ToM) in communicating agents. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of leveraging ToM to improve and explain NLP models, which is explicitly mentioned as a key topic. The proposal connects ToM with model explainability and human value alignment, both highlighted in the workshop description. The idea also touches on cognitive foundations of ToM by incorporating cognitive science frameworks for annotation. The only minor limitation is that while the workshop mentions acquisition of ToM, the proposal doesn't strongly address how the model would acquire ToM capabilities beyond supervised training."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, approach, and evaluation. The dual-channel architecture is explained concisely, and concrete examples are provided to illustrate how the model would generate ToM-based explanations. The annotation process and training objectives are defined with sufficient detail. However, some technical aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific mechanisms for ensuring coherence between the task output and inferred mental states, and how the posterior ToM reasoning would be implemented. The proposal outlines what will be done but could provide more specifics on how certain components would be operationalized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel approach to model explainability by explicitly incorporating Theory of Mind components into transformer architectures. While explainable AI is a well-established field, using ToM as a framework for generating human-aligned explanations represents a fresh perspective. The dual-channel architecture that simultaneously learns task objectives and mental state prediction is innovative. The approach of generating explanations via posterior ToM reasoning differs from conventional post-hoc explanation methods. However, the core techniques (transformer models, supervised learning) are established, and some aspects of mental state modeling have been explored in dialogue systems, though not with the comprehensive ToM framework proposed here."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents some implementation challenges. The technical components (transformer models, multi-task learning) are well-established. Annotating datasets with mental state labels is achievable through crowdsourcing, though ensuring annotation quality and consistency for subjective mental states will require careful protocol design. The main challenges lie in: (1) creating reliable ToM annotations at scale, (2) designing effective regularization mechanisms to ensure coherence between task outputs and mental states, and (3) developing evaluation metrics that can reliably measure explanation faithfulness. The proposal acknowledges the need for human judgments in evaluation, which adds complexity but is appropriate for the task. Overall, the idea is implementable with current technology but requires significant effort in dataset creation and evaluation methodology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in current AI systems: the lack of human-like reasoning about mental states that makes AI decisions opaque and potentially misaligned with human values. The significance is particularly high for high-stakes domains mentioned in the proposal (healthcare, education) where transparency and trust are essential. By creating models that can explain their decisions through a ToM lens, this work could substantially advance human-AI collaboration and address growing concerns about AI transparency. The approach also creates a bridge between cognitive science and machine learning, potentially yielding insights for both fields. If successful, this research could establish a new paradigm for explainable AI that is fundamentally aligned with human cognitive processes rather than technical model internals."
