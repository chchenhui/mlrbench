    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on using scientific methods to understand deep learning. It proposes using dataset distillation as an empirical approach to reveal inductive biases of different architectures (CNNs, Transformers, hybrids), which directly addresses the workshop's call for studies that 'validate or falsify hypotheses about the inner workings of deep networks.' The proposal specifically mentions investigating inductive biases, which is explicitly listed as a topic of interest. The approach is empirical rather than purely theoretical, using controlled experiments to test hypotheses about architectural differences, perfectly matching the workshop's emphasis on the scientific method over purely mathematical approaches."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, methodology, and expected outcomes. The core concept of using dataset distillation as a probe for inductive biases is precisely defined. The specific research questions are explicitly stated: (1) which architectures preserve high-level semantic structures versus local patterns, and (2) how these differences affect robustness to distribution shifts. The intervention experiments are also clearly described. There are only minor ambiguities around the exact implementation details of the distillation process and the specific metrics that will be used to quantify the differences between architectures, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates strong originality by repurposing dataset distillation—typically used for efficiency—as a tool for scientific inquiry into architectural biases. While dataset distillation itself is not new, and studies of inductive biases exist, the combination creates a fresh methodological approach. The intervention experiments to introduce targeted spurious correlations add another innovative dimension. The approach offers a systematic framework for comparing architectural biases empirically rather than theoretically, which is relatively uncommon. It doesn't receive a perfect score because it builds upon existing techniques rather than introducing entirely new methods, but the novel application and combination of techniques represents significant innovation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Dataset distillation techniques are established in the literature, and the architectures to be compared (CNNs, Transformers, hybrids) are widely available. The experimental setup involving controlled interventions is implementable with current resources. However, there are moderate challenges: dataset distillation can be computationally expensive, especially for complex datasets; the analysis of distilled datasets to extract meaningful patterns about inductive biases may require sophisticated techniques; and ensuring that the distilled datasets truly capture the essence of the original data's structure is non-trivial. These challenges are surmountable but require careful experimental design and sufficient computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a fundamental gap in deep learning: understanding why different architectures work well for different tasks. The significance is high because: (1) it could provide empirical evidence for theoretical hypotheses about architectural biases; (2) it offers a systematic framework for architecture comparison beyond performance metrics; (3) the findings could directly inform architecture selection and design for specific applications; and (4) it bridges the theory-practice gap highlighted in the workshop description. The potential impact extends to multiple domains where understanding model biases is crucial for robustness and reliability. The approach could become a standard tool for characterizing new architectures, making it highly significant for the field."
