        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on modularity for collaborative, decentralized, and continual deep learning by proposing a framework (DMKD) that transforms monolithic models into modular experts. The proposal incorporates key elements from the literature review, including knowledge distillation techniques (referencing m2mKD), decentralized training approaches (building on DIMAT), and entropy-based specialization metrics. The research objectives clearly target the sustainability challenges mentioned in the task description by enabling knowledge preservation and reuse. The methodology section provides detailed technical approaches that align with the main idea of creating specialized expert modules with dynamic routing mechanisms. The proposal comprehensively addresses all aspects of the task requirements with no significant inconsistencies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations for the knowledge preservation protocol, entropy-based specialization metric, and decentralized training procedures. The experimental design is well-defined with specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for how the gating network G_\\\\theta is trained is not fully specified, (2) the relationship between the entropy measure and module specialization could be more explicitly connected to the routing mechanism, and (3) some details about the implementation of the spectral clustering for module assignment are missing. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The integration of knowledge distillation, modular architecture, entropy-based specialization metrics, and decentralized training creates a unique framework that addresses the sustainability challenges in deep learning. The knowledge preservation protocol that identifies and transfers valuable parameters from deprecated models is a fresh approach to model recycling. The entropy-based specialization metric for guiding the routing mechanism is also innovative. However, many of the individual components build directly on existing work (e.g., DIMAT for decentralized training, knowledge distillation techniques from m2mKD), rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The proposal extends and combines these approaches in creative ways but doesn't present a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift. The novelty lies more in the integration and application of these techniques to create a sustainable ecosystem for continual learning."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The mathematical formulations for knowledge preservation, entropy-based specialization, and decentralized training are well-defined and theoretically sound. The importance scoring mechanism for identifying valuable parameters is grounded in established principles of neural network optimization. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics to validate the approach. The ablation studies are well-conceived to isolate the effects of different components. However, there are a few areas where additional theoretical justification would strengthen the proposal: (1) the spectral clustering approach for module assignment could benefit from more theoretical motivation, (2) the choice of the specific entropy formulation could be better justified, and (3) the theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the decentralized training procedure are not fully addressed. Despite these minor limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and implementation details. The use of established frameworks like PyTorch and well-known datasets (CIFAR-100, ImageNet, GLUE) enhances practicality. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes appropriate baselines and metrics. The technical approach builds on existing methods that have been demonstrated to work in practice. However, there are several implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) the computational resources required for the initial distillation from large models could be substantial, (2) the spectral clustering approach for module assignment may face scalability issues with very large models, (3) the coordination of decentralized training across multiple nodes introduces complexity in terms of synchronization and communication, and (4) the dynamic routing mechanism may require significant hyperparameter tuning to work effectively. While these challenges are manageable, they do increase the implementation complexity and resource requirements, making the proposal moderately challenging to execute fully."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in deep learning: the unsustainable practice of discarding deprecated models and retraining from scratch. The DMKD framework has the potential for substantial impact across multiple dimensions. First, it could significantly reduce the computational resources and carbon footprint associated with training large models by enabling knowledge reuse. Second, it addresses catastrophic forgetting in continual learning through modular specialization. Third, it enables collaborative model development in a decentralized setting, which could democratize access to advanced AI capabilities. The broader impacts section clearly articulates these potential benefits, including sustainability, collaboration, accessibility, and foundations for future work. The dissemination plan through open-source code, workshops, and publications will maximize the reach and influence of the research. The significance is particularly high given the growing concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training increasingly large AI models."
