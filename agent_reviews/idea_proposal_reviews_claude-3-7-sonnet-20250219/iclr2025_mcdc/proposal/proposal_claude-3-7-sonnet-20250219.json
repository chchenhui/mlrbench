    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on modularity for collaborative, decentralized, and continual deep learning by proposing the ModuleMesh framework. The proposal tackles the unsustainable 'bigger is better' paradigm mentioned in the task description by introducing a modular approach that preserves knowledge across model generations. It incorporates the core concepts from the research idea, including decentralized knowledge distillation, specialized expert modules, dynamic routing, and knowledge preservation protocols. The proposal also builds upon the literature review by extending concepts like module-to-module knowledge distillation (m2mKD), addressing optimization challenges in modular networks, balancing stability and plasticity in continual learning, and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions challenges with communication overhead in decentralized systems, the proposal could have more explicitly addressed how it overcomes these specific challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical details are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the approach understandable and implementable. The four main components of the methodology (modular expert architecture, decentralized knowledge distillation, dynamic routing mechanism, and knowledge preservation protocol) are thoroughly explained with formal definitions. The experimental design section provides specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics, demonstrating a well-thought-out research plan. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact communication protocol for decentralized updates could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the entropy-based specialization metric and the router training could be further elaborated, and (3) some of the hyperparameters (α, λ, β, γ) are introduced without clear guidelines for setting their values."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing concepts into a cohesive framework with novel elements. The ModuleMesh framework combines mixture-of-experts architectures, knowledge distillation, and continual learning in a decentralized setting, which represents a fresh approach to sustainable AI development. The knowledge preservation protocol that identifies and transfers valuable parameters from deprecated models to new architectures is particularly innovative. The entropy-based specialization metric for guiding routing decisions also adds novelty. However, many of the individual components build directly upon existing techniques mentioned in the literature review, such as module-to-module knowledge distillation, decentralized training approaches, and methods for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. While the integration is novel, the fundamental techniques themselves are extensions rather than completely new paradigms. The proposal would benefit from more explicitly highlighting what specific technical innovations differentiate it from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The mathematical formulations for the modular expert architecture, knowledge distillation, dynamic routing, and knowledge preservation are well-defined and theoretically sound. The use of established techniques like Kullback-Leibler divergence for knowledge distillation and fisher information for parameter importance scoring is appropriate. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear evaluation metrics and baseline comparisons that would allow for rigorous validation of the approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) the theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the decentralized learning approach are not fully addressed, (2) the potential impact of expert specialization on overall model performance could be more rigorously analyzed, and (3) the proposal could benefit from a more detailed analysis of how the approach handles potential conflicts between experts during the aggregation phase."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation paths, though it does involve several complex components that would need to be carefully integrated. The modular architecture and knowledge distillation techniques build on established methods, making these aspects highly feasible. The experimental design uses standard datasets (CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, DomainNet, Office-Home, Visual Decathlon) and well-defined evaluation metrics, which is practical. However, there are several challenges that could affect feasibility: (1) the decentralized knowledge distillation across distributed nodes may face communication bottlenecks and synchronization issues in practice, (2) the knowledge mapping between old and new architectures could be difficult to implement effectively, especially for significantly different architectures, (3) the computational overhead of maintaining and routing between multiple expert modules might be substantial, and (4) the proposal aims for ambitious performance targets (e.g., 90% retention of performance on earlier tasks, 60-80% reduction in computational resources) that may be difficult to achieve in practice. Overall, while the approach is implementable, it would require significant engineering effort and may face practical challenges in achieving all stated goals."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the field of deep learning: the unsustainable cycle of training increasingly large models from scratch and discarding deprecated ones. The ModuleMesh framework has the potential for transformative impact by fundamentally changing how AI systems are developed and maintained. The expected outcomes include substantial reductions in computational requirements (60-80%), mitigation of catastrophic forgetting, enhanced collaboration capabilities, improved model flexibility, and a more sustainable development lifecycle. These outcomes would address major challenges in the field, including the environmental impact of AI training, accessibility of advanced AI research to institutions with limited resources, and the inefficiency of current development practices. The broader impacts extend to democratization of AI development, environmental sustainability, accelerated innovation, knowledge preservation, enhanced model interpretability, and new research directions. The proposal aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on modularity for collaborative, decentralized, and continual deep learning, and could significantly advance the state of the art in these areas. The potential for real-world impact is substantial, as the approach could be applied across various domains and model architectures."
