    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on modularity for collaborative, decentralized, and continual deep learning by proposing a framework that combines modular knowledge distillation, decentralized training, and continual learning. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, including m2mKD for module-to-module knowledge distillation, DIMAT for decentralized training, and Subspace Distillation for continual learning. The research objectives clearly target the workshop topics of Mixture-of-Experts architectures, model recycling, and decentralized training. The only minor inconsistency is that some referenced papers in the methodology (like 'Adaptively Integrated Distillation') aren't fully elaborated on in terms of how they specifically inform the proposed approach."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formulations. The Graph of Specialized Experts (GoSE) architecture, Knowledge Preservation Protocol (KPP), and Entropy-Guided Selection (EGS) mechanism are all well-defined. The evaluation plan includes specific datasets, baselines, and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for identifying 'critical parameters' in the KPP needs more detail, (2) the alignment function D_align in the global merging equation contains a Chinese character that creates ambiguity, and (3) the relationship between the proposed approach and some of the cited works (e.g., Adaptively Integrated Distillation) could be more explicitly described."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty by integrating several cutting-edge concepts into a cohesive framework. The Knowledge Preservation Protocol (KPP) for identifying and preserving critical parameters from deprecated models is an innovative approach to knowledge recycling. The Entropy-Guided Selection (EGS) mechanism for dynamic routing based on task confidence represents a novel way to quantify and leverage module specialization. The integration of decentralized training with modular knowledge distillation and continual learning is also original. While individual components draw from existing work (m2mKD, DIMAT, etc.), their combination and adaptation into a unified framework for sustainable AI development represents a fresh perspective. The proposal could have scored higher if it had more thoroughly explained how its approach fundamentally differs from or advances beyond the existing methods it builds upon."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for distillation loss, entropy-based routing, and global merging are technically correct and appropriate for the described tasks. The evaluation plan includes relevant datasets and metrics that align with the research objectives. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in balancing the various loss components, (2) there's limited discussion of convergence guarantees for the decentralized training approach, (3) the mechanism for subspace distillation is mentioned but not mathematically formalized, and (4) there's a typo or unclear notation in the global merging equation (D_align). While the overall approach is well-founded, these gaps in technical detail prevent it from receiving a higher score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined components and evaluation metrics. The use of established datasets (ImageNet-1k, COCO, GitHub Code Corpora) and comparison with relevant baselines is practical. The modular nature of the framework allows for incremental development and testing of individual components. However, several challenges may affect implementation: (1) the computational resources required for training on large datasets across multiple modalities could be substantial, (2) the complexity of implementing and debugging the decentralized training system with gradient-space alignment might be significant, (3) the proposal doesn't fully address how to handle potential instabilities in the entropy-based routing during training, and (4) the ambitious goal of 40% reduction in carbon footprint while maintaining 90% accuracy may be difficult to achieve in practice. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present notable implementation hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in current deep learning paradigms: the unsustainable practice of discarding deprecated models and retraining from scratch. The significance of this work is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) Environmental impact - the potential 40% reduction in training carbon footprint would represent a major advancement in sustainable AI, (2) Computational efficiency - the proposed 1.5Ã— lower computational cost at inference compared to static MoE models would benefit deployment in resource-constrained environments, (3) Knowledge preservation - the 20% reduction in catastrophic forgetting addresses a fundamental challenge in continual learning, (4) Collaborative development - the decentralized framework enables distributed teams to contribute specialized modules, democratizing AI development. The proposal also has significant theoretical implications by unifying modular networks, knowledge distillation, and decentralized optimization. The practical applications in cloud computing, healthcare, and finance further underscore its broad impact potential."
