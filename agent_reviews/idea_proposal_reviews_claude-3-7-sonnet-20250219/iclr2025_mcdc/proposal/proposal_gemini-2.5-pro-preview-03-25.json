        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on modularity, collaborative/decentralized training, and continual learning. The proposed Decentralized Modular Knowledge Distillation (DMKD) framework incorporates key elements from the research idea, including specialized knowledge distillation into modular experts, dynamic routing, and the knowledge preservation protocol. The proposal thoroughly integrates concepts from the literature review, citing relevant works on modular knowledge distillation (Lo et al., 2024), continual learning approaches (Chen et al., 2023; Roy et al., 2023), decentralized training (Saadati et al., 2024), dynamic routing (Johnson & Lee, 2023), knowledge preservation (White & Black, 2023), and entropy-based specialization metrics (Green & Brown, 2023). The methodology specifically addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, including optimization difficulties in modular architectures, balancing stability and plasticity, communication overheads, catastrophic forgetting, and efficient knowledge transfer."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and well-defined. The methodology section provides detailed algorithmic steps, mathematical formulas, and experimental design, making the implementation approach transparent. The proposal effectively explains complex concepts like the knowledge preservation protocol, entropy-guided routing, and decentralized coordination. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for decentralized coordination could be more precisely defined, particularly regarding how modules are distributed and synchronized across nodes; (2) the relationship between the router and the expert modules during training could be further elaborated; and (3) some mathematical formulations, while correct, could be more thoroughly explained in terms of their practical implementation. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity of the proposal is strong, with sufficient detail for implementation and evaluation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The integration of decentralized training, modular architectures, knowledge distillation, and continual learning into a cohesive framework represents a novel approach not previously explored in the literature. The knowledge preservation protocol, which identifies and transfers salient parameters between modules across time, is particularly innovative. The use of entropy-based metrics to quantify module specialization and guide the routing mechanism is also a novel contribution. While individual components like knowledge distillation, modular networks, and decentralized training have been explored separately in the literature, their combination and specific implementation in the DMKD framework represents a fresh perspective. The proposal builds upon existing work (e.g., m2mKD, DIMAT, subspace distillation) but extends these approaches in new directions. The framework's focus on sustainability through knowledge reuse and preservation aligns with emerging research directions but takes a distinctive approach. The proposal is not entirely groundbreaking, as it leverages established techniques, but its novel integration and specific mechanisms for knowledge preservation and module specialization justify a high novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness overall, with well-established theoretical foundations. The methodology is grounded in established techniques from knowledge distillation, modular networks, and continual learning. The mathematical formulations for routing, knowledge distillation loss, module specialization entropy, and Fisher information are technically correct and appropriate for the described approach. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the proposal lacks detailed theoretical analysis of convergence properties in the decentralized setting; (2) while the knowledge preservation protocol is innovative, its theoretical guarantees for mitigating catastrophic forgetting could be more rigorously established; (3) the interaction between the entropy-based specialization metric and the routing mechanism could benefit from more formal analysis; and (4) the proposal could more explicitly address potential challenges in the non-IID data setting for decentralized training. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and well-justified, with a clear connection between the proposed methods and the research objectives."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components and implementation steps. The algorithmic steps are clearly defined and implementable using current deep learning frameworks. The experimental design uses standard datasets (CIFAR, ImageNet) and established evaluation metrics for continual learning. The modular approach allows for incremental development and testing of individual components. However, several aspects present implementation challenges: (1) the decentralized training component adds significant complexity, requiring careful coordination between nodes and potentially substantial communication overhead; (2) the dynamic routing mechanism and knowledge preservation protocol, while conceptually clear, may require extensive hyperparameter tuning to work effectively; (3) the computational resources needed for comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets and baselines could be substantial; and (4) the integration of multiple complex components (modular networks, knowledge distillation, decentralized training, dynamic routing) increases the risk of implementation difficulties. While these challenges are significant, they do not render the proposal infeasible, but rather indicate a moderate to high level of implementation complexity that would require careful planning and potentially phased development."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses critical challenges in current deep learning paradigms with potentially high impact. The DMKD framework directly tackles the sustainability issues highlighted in the workshop description by enabling knowledge reuse and reducing computational waste through modular, reusable components. The approach offers a promising solution to catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, a fundamental problem that limits the deployment of AI in dynamic environments. The decentralized nature of the framework aligns with growing interest in collaborative AI development and edge computing scenarios. If successful, this research could significantly influence how deep learning models are developed, maintained, and evolved over time, moving away from the disposable model paradigm toward more sustainable practices. The proposal's integration of modularity, knowledge preservation, and decentralized training addresses multiple key challenges identified in the literature review. The potential applications span various domains where continual adaptation is crucial, such as autonomous systems, healthcare, and personalized services. The significance is further enhanced by the framework's potential to democratize AI development by enabling collaborative model building across distributed resources."
