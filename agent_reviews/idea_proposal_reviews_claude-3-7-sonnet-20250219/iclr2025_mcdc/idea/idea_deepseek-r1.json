        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on modularity for collaborative, decentralized, and continual deep learning. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the task description: Mixture-of-Experts architectures, decentralized training, and model recycling. The proposal specifically tackles communication efficiency in federated learning through modular approaches, which is a central theme of the workshop. The idea of sparse expert updates and expert recycling perfectly matches the workshop's interest in sustainable model development and reuse of existing models. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address some secondary topics like model soups or adaptive architectures beyond the MoE framework."

        "justification": "The research idea is presented in a well-structured and comprehensible manner. The motivation clearly establishes the problem with current federated learning approaches. The main idea is articulated with three specific innovations (sparse expert updates, router consensus, and expert recycling) that form the core of the proposal. The expected outcomes are quantified (50-70% reduction in communication costs) and qualitatively described. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as how exactly the router consensus mechanism works while preserving privacy, and what specific algorithms will be used for expert selection and aggregation. The proposal is clear enough to understand the general approach but leaves some implementation specifics undefined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines two established concepts—federated learning and Mixture-of-Experts—in a novel way that specifically addresses communication efficiency. While both FL and MoE are well-studied individually, their integration with a focus on decentralized expert training and sparse updates represents a fresh approach. The concept of expert recycling is particularly innovative, as it introduces a sustainable dimension to model development. However, the core mechanisms build upon existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical frameworks. The router consensus mechanism appears to be an extension of existing federated aggregation techniques applied to gating networks. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and application rather than in creating entirely new methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach builds on established technologies (federated learning and MoE), which suggests implementation is realistic. The sparse expert updates mechanism has clear precedent in both federated learning literature (where partial model updates are common) and in MoE training (where sparse activations are standard). The expert recycling concept is practically implementable using transfer learning techniques. However, there are notable challenges: ensuring the router consensus mechanism works effectively across heterogeneous data distributions could be difficult; maintaining model coherence when experts are trained independently might require sophisticated coordination; and the privacy guarantees during router aggregation need careful implementation. The proposal doesn't address potential computational overhead on client devices for maintaining and selecting experts. Overall, the idea is feasible but would require significant engineering effort to implement effectively."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical challenge in collaborative AI development: enabling institutions to pool capabilities without compromising data privacy or incurring prohibitive communication costs. The 50-70% reduction in communication costs would be a substantial improvement for federated learning systems, potentially enabling their deployment in bandwidth-constrained environments. The approach could significantly advance federated learning's applicability to non-IID data scenarios, which is a major current limitation. The expert recycling component aligns with growing concerns about the sustainability of AI development. If successful, this work could influence how distributed AI systems are designed, moving away from monolithic models toward modular, reusable components. The impact would be particularly significant for domains where data privacy is paramount, such as healthcare and finance, while still enabling collaborative model improvement."
