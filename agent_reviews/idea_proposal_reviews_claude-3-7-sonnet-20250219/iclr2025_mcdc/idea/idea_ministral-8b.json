    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on modularity for collaborative, decentralized, and continual deep learning. It directly addresses the core issues identified in the task description: the unsustainability of monolithic models and the need for modular approaches. The proposal specifically mentions key topics from the workshop scope including Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), routing algorithms, and combining independently trained checkpoints. It also targets applications in continual learning and machine unlearning, which are explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address decentralized and collaborative training algorithms in detail, though it does mention collaborative development as a motivation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated and understandable. It clearly outlines the motivation, main approaches (MoE, PEFT, routing algorithms, checkpoint combination), and expected outcomes. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further elaboration. For instance, the specific methodologies for converting existing dense models into modular frameworks are not detailed. Similarly, while routing algorithms are mentioned, the specific innovations proposed in this area aren't clearly defined. The proposal would be stronger with more concrete details on the technical approaches and evaluation metrics that will be used to measure success in terms of model performance, training costs, and flexibility."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea combines several existing concepts (MoE, PEFT, model merging) rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques. While the integration of these approaches toward a comprehensive modular framework has merit, many of these components are already active research areas. The concept of converting dense models to modular ones (MoE-fication) shows some originality, as does the emphasis on combining independently trained checkpoints for multi-task models. However, similar ideas have been explored in recent literature on model merging, model soups, and sparse expert models. The proposal would benefit from more clearly articulating what specific novel contributions it aims to make beyond the current state of the art in each of these areas."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is quite feasible with current technology and methods. MoE architectures, PEFT techniques, and model merging approaches are all established areas with existing implementations and frameworks. The computational resources required are significant but not prohibitive, especially since the proposal aims to improve efficiency. The modular nature of the proposed approach actually enhances feasibility, as components can be developed and tested incrementally. The conversion of dense models to modular frameworks might present some challenges, but there are already precedents for this in the literature. The routing algorithm development is perhaps the most challenging aspect, but even this builds on existing work in conditional computation and dynamic neural networks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical problem in deep learning: the unsustainability and inefficiency of the current monolithic model paradigm. If successful, it could lead to a significant shift in how models are developed, maintained, and evolved over time. The potential impacts include reduced computational costs for training, more collaborative model development, and enhanced model adaptability for diverse applications. These outcomes align well with growing concerns about the environmental and economic costs of AI development. The significance is particularly high given the current trend toward ever-larger models and the diminishing returns of this approach. The research could contribute to making AI development more sustainable, accessible, and adaptable to changing requirements and environments."
