    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on modularity for continual learning. It directly addresses the topic of Mixture-of-Experts architectures and their application to continual learning, which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop scope. The proposal tackles the challenge of managing model complexity over time through expert pruning and merging, which connects well with the workshop's interest in adaptive architectures and model merging. The idea also addresses the workshop's concern about sustainable ML development by proposing methods to avoid unbounded model growth, making it highly relevant to the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (unbounded growth in modular architectures during continual learning), proposes a specific solution (dynamic expert management through similarity assessment and knowledge consolidation), and outlines concrete mechanisms for implementation. The proposal specifies how experts will be assessed for similarity and how consolidation will occur. However, some minor details could be further elaborated, such as the specific metrics for determining when to trigger merging/pruning and the exact algorithms for merging experts beyond the brief mentions of parameter averaging or task-vector merging."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. While Mixture-of-Experts, expert pruning, and model merging are established techniques individually, their integration into a dynamic framework specifically for continual learning represents an innovative approach. The automatic assessment of expert similarity and subsequent consolidation as a periodic process during continual learning appears to be a novel contribution. However, the core techniques mentioned (parameter averaging, task-vector merging) build upon existing methods rather than proposing fundamentally new algorithms, which prevents it from receiving the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. MoE architectures are well-established, and techniques for measuring functional similarity between neural network components exist in the literature. The proposed expert merging and pruning operations are computationally tractable and can be implemented using existing frameworks. The buffering of examples for similarity assessment is a practical approach. The main implementation challenges would likely be in determining optimal thresholds for merging/pruning and ensuring that the consolidated experts maintain performance across all relevant tasks, but these challenges appear manageable with careful experimentation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses an important problem in continual learning: how to maintain model efficiency while accommodating new knowledge. If successful, it could significantly advance the field by enabling more sustainable lifelong learning systems that don't suffer from unbounded growth. The impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications, as it could make continual learning more viable for real-world deployment where computational and memory resources are limited. The approach also aligns with broader trends toward more efficient and sustainable AI systems. While highly significant, it doesn't receive a perfect score as it focuses on a specific aspect of continual learning rather than revolutionizing the entire field."
