        "justification": "The P2P-MoE idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on modularity for collaborative, decentralized, and continual deep learning. It directly addresses key topics mentioned in the task description including Mixture-of-Experts architectures, routing of specialized experts, model merging, decentralized training, and applications of modularity for continual learning. The proposal specifically tackles the workshop's concern about monolithic models being costly, prone to forgetting, and rarely reused once deprecated. The peer-to-peer approach with expert modules and a shared router network perfectly embodies the workshop's call for modular components that can be seamlessly integrated and reused."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (limitations of monolithic models in decentralized settings), proposes a specific solution (P2P-MoE with local expert training and gossip-based router aggregation), and outlines the key mechanisms (sparse routing, expert signatures, periodic merging). The technical approach is described with sufficient detail to understand the overall architecture and workflow. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific mechanisms for gossip aggregation, how expert signatures are defined, and the exact criteria for representation similarity during merging. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel combination of several existing concepts in a way that creates a unique approach. While Mixture-of-Experts, federated learning, and model merging are established techniques individually, their integration into a peer-to-peer system with gossip-based router aggregation and representation-based expert merging represents a fresh perspective. The focus on expert signatures rather than full weight sharing for privacy preservation is innovative. The concept of upcycling experts from pre-trained models in a decentralized setting is particularly novel. However, it builds upon existing MoE and federated learning foundations rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is largely feasible with existing technologies and methods. MoE architectures, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and federated learning techniques are well-established. The gossip-based aggregation of routing information and expert signatures is implementable using existing distributed systems techniques. However, there are some practical challenges that would need to be addressed: ensuring router consistency across peers with asynchronous updates, managing network latency during inference when selecting experts across peers, handling peer availability/reliability issues, and developing effective representation similarity metrics for expert merging. These implementation challenges, while not insurmountable, would require significant engineering effort and careful design considerations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses several critical challenges in modern deep learning: the high cost and inefficiency of training monolithic models, catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, privacy concerns in collaborative settings, and the wasteful practice of discarding deprecated models. The P2P-MoE approach could have far-reaching impacts by enabling more efficient, privacy-preserving, and sustainable model development in decentralized environments. It could be particularly transformative for resource-constrained settings where full model training is prohibitive. The approach also aligns with broader trends toward more modular, reusable AI systems. The potential to create continuously evolving, collaborative AI systems without central coordination represents a significant advancement in the field."
