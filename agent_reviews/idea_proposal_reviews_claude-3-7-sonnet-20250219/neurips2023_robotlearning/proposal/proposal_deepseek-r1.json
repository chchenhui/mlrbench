    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on fine-tuning large pre-trained models for robotics with limited hardware while ensuring safe deployment. The proposal incorporates the core concept of 'safety adapters' from the research idea, implementing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (using <5% of parameters) and safety-constrained reinforcement learning. The literature review is thoroughly integrated, with clear connections to papers like KALIE and Skip Tuning for adapter-based approaches, and TRC and shielding methods for safe RL. The proposal maintains consistency with the workshop's interest in combining different modalities (vision-language) and addresses all key aspects: pre-training, fine-tuning, generalization, and safety."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations for the contrastive alignment objective, safety-constrained RL, and shielded policy optimization. The two-phase methodology (pre-training adapters and safety-constrained RL fine-tuning) is well-defined with specific algorithms and implementation details. The experimental design includes clear tasks, baselines, and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for how the safety critic interacts with the policy during deployment could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the contrastive pre-training and the safety constraints could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., CQL) are introduced without full explanation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing approaches in a novel way. The integration of adapter-based fine-tuning with safety-constrained RL specifically for vision-language models in robotics represents a fresh perspective. The contrastive alignment between vision-language embeddings and robot state-action pairs is an innovative approach to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and control. However, many of the individual components draw heavily from existing work cited in the literature review (e.g., adapter architectures from KALIE and Skip Tuning, safety mechanisms similar to TRC and shielding approaches). While the combination is novel, the fundamental techniques themselves are extensions rather than groundbreaking innovations. The proposal acknowledges its foundations in existing work while offering incremental but meaningful improvements in how these techniques are integrated for the specific context of safe robot learning."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for contrastive learning and safety-constrained RL are well-defined and based on established principles. The two-phase approach (pre-training followed by fine-tuning) is theoretically sound and builds upon proven techniques in the literature. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics for evaluation, with statistical validation through ANOVA across multiple seeds. The safety mechanisms, particularly the shielded policy optimization with a risk-aware Q-network, are well-justified. However, there are some areas that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the theoretical guarantees for the safety constraints could be more rigorously established, (2) the convergence properties of the combined contrastive learning and RL approach are not fully analyzed, and (3) potential failure modes or edge cases in the safety critic are not thoroughly addressed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with realistic implementation requirements. The use of adapter-based fine-tuning significantly reduces computational demands compared to full model fine-tuning, making it practical for resource-constrained settings. The experimental setup using established simulation environments (RLBench, Habitat-Matterport) is reasonable and accessible. The expected outcome of fine-tuning in under 1 hour on a single GPU is ambitious but potentially achievable given the parameter efficiency. However, several implementation challenges exist: (1) collecting sufficient multi-modal logs for pre-training may be difficult, especially for novel tasks, (2) the safety critic requires careful tuning to avoid being too conservative or too permissive, (3) the integration of multiple complex components (VLMs, adapters, safety critics) introduces engineering complexity, and (4) the zero-shot generalization claim of >80% success rate is optimistic and may require more extensive validation. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the approach impractical, just more difficult than the proposal might suggest."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in deploying large vision-language models for robotics: how to efficiently adapt these models while ensuring safety. This has substantial significance for both research and practical applications. The parameter-efficient approach (using <5% of parameters) democratizes access to large models for researchers with limited computational resources, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals. The safety-constrained fine-tuning addresses a major concern in deploying learning-based systems on physical robots. If successful, this work could establish new standards for safe, efficient adaptation of large models in robotics, with applications in homes, healthcare, and industry. The broader impact section convincingly argues for the democratization of advanced AI techniques and establishment of safety standards. While the approach may not completely revolutionize the field, it represents a significant step forward in making large pre-trained models practical and safe for real-world robotic applications."
