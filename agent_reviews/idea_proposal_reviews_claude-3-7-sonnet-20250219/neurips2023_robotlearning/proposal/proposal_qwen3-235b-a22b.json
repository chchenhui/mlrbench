    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on fine-tuning large pre-trained models for robotics with limited hardware while ensuring safe deployment. The SafeAdapt3D framework incorporates parameter-efficient adaptation (via adapters) of vision-language models, contrastive pre-training on offline data, and safety-constrained reinforcement learning—all key topics mentioned in the workshop description. The methodology builds upon recent works cited in the literature review, including adapter-based fine-tuning approaches (Sharma et al. 2023, KALIE 2024) and safe reinforcement learning techniques (Liu et al. 2023, Du et al. 2023). The proposal's emphasis on safety guarantees, sample efficiency, and generalization to novel tasks directly responds to the challenges identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the three main components of SafeAdapt3D (frozen VLM, SafetyAdapter, and SafetyCritic) are well-defined. The technical formulations, including the adapter architecture, contrastive loss, and safety-constrained RL objectives, are presented with appropriate mathematical notation. The experimental design section outlines datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics in a straightforward manner. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the contrastive pre-training phase and the RL fine-tuning phase could be more explicitly connected, (2) some technical details about the SafetyCritic's implementation are somewhat abstract, and (3) Figure 1 is referenced but not provided in the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing concepts in a novel way. The core innovation lies in combining parameter-efficient adapter-based fine-tuning with safety-constrained reinforcement learning for vision-language robotics. While both adapter-based fine-tuning (Sharma et al. 2023, KALIE 2024) and safe RL (Liu et al. 2023, Du et al. 2023) exist separately in the literature, their integration with a contrastive pre-training approach specifically for vision-language robotics represents a fresh perspective. The SafetyCritic component that provides action masking during exploration is a valuable contribution to safe deployment. However, the individual components (adapters, contrastive learning, conservative Q-learning) are established techniques, and the proposal builds incrementally upon them rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical frameworks."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The adapter architecture follows established practices in parameter-efficient fine-tuning, with clear mathematical formulations. The contrastive learning approach for aligning visual, linguistic, and robot state representations is theoretically sound and builds on proven techniques. The safety-constrained RL formulation using Conservative Q-Learning with a safety critic is well-justified and mathematically rigorous. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics to evaluate the approach. The proposal also acknowledges the theoretical foundations of its safety guarantees through Lyapunov stability analysis. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from more rigorous justification: (1) the specific choice of adapter architecture and placement within the VLM, (2) the theoretical guarantees of the SafetyCritic's ability to prevent all unsafe actions, and (3) more detailed explanation of how the contrastive pre-training objective translates to effective policy learning."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation requirements. The adapter-based fine-tuning strategy is computationally efficient, requiring only 5% of the total parameters to be updated, which makes it practical for deployment on limited hardware (single GPU). The use of existing datasets (MetaWorld benchmarks and Google's RT-2 dataset) for pre-training is reasonable. The experimental setup with the KALIE testbed and UR5e robot is appropriate and achievable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the claim of achieving fine-tuning in under 1 hour with ≤1000 trials seems ambitious given the complexity of the tasks, (2) ensuring zero collisions during exploration with a learned SafetyCritic may be challenging in practice, especially in dynamic environments, (3) the integration of multiple complex components (VLM, adapters, contrastive learning, safe RL) increases implementation complexity, and (4) the Lyapunov stability analysis for formal safety guarantees may be difficult to establish in practice for complex, high-dimensional robotic systems."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses significant challenges in deploying large vision-language models for robotics applications. Its contributions have important implications for several key areas: (1) democratizing access to large pre-trained models by reducing computational requirements, enabling smaller labs to leverage these powerful models, (2) ensuring safety in robotic learning and deployment, which is critical for real-world applications, especially in human environments, (3) improving sample efficiency in robot learning, which addresses a major bottleneck in current approaches, and (4) enhancing generalization to novel objects and tasks. The expected outcomes, if achieved, would represent meaningful advances in making large pre-trained models more accessible and safer for robotics applications. The broader impact section convincingly argues for applications beyond robotics, including computer vision, NLP, and ethical AI development. The proposal directly addresses multiple challenges identified in the literature review, particularly regarding parameter-efficient adaptation and safety guarantees."
