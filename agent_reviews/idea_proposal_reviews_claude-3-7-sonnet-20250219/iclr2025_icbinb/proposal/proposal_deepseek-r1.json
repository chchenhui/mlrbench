    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of deep learning failures in real-world healthcare applications, which is consistent with the ICBINB workshop's focus on understanding why deep learning approaches don't always deliver as expected. The proposal incorporates the four elements requested in the task: a healthcare use case tackled with deep learning, solutions proposed in literature, descriptions of negative outcomes, and investigations into why these solutions failed. The multi-dimensional framework specifically addresses the literature review's key challenges, including underspecification, deployment workflow issues, adversarial vulnerabilities, data distribution shifts, and clinical workflow integration. The methodology comprehensively covers retrospective analysis, experimental simulations, and stakeholder interviews as outlined in the research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated with distinct sections for introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. Research objectives are explicitly stated and the four-dimensional analysis framework is thoroughly explained with appropriate mathematical formulations. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of data collection methods, experimental design, and evaluation metrics. The proposal uses technical terminology appropriately and defines complex concepts. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific criteria for selecting case studies could be more detailed, (2) the connection between the four dimensions and the taxonomy development could be more explicitly explained, and (3) some technical details about the decision support tool development are somewhat vague. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its comprehensive, multi-dimensional approach to analyzing deep learning failures in healthcare. While individual components (like distribution shift analysis or fairness metrics) have been explored in prior work, the integration of these dimensions into a unified framework specifically for healthcare applications is innovative. The proposal's strength lies in combining technical analysis with clinical workflow integration and trust assessmentâ€”bridging technical and human factors in a novel way. However, many of the individual methods proposed (MMD, DANN, SHAP, adversarial testing) are established techniques rather than new methodological innovations. The taxonomy development approach, while valuable, builds upon existing failure analysis frameworks rather than proposing a fundamentally new paradigm. The proposal offers a fresh perspective on an important problem but doesn't introduce groundbreaking new technical methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The multi-dimensional framework is built on well-established methods in machine learning, including Maximum Mean Discrepancy for distribution shift analysis, fairness metrics like Disparate Impact and Equalized Odds, and SHAP values for interpretability assessment. The mathematical formulations are correctly presented, and the experimental design includes appropriate controls and validation strategies. The proposal incorporates both quantitative and qualitative methods, strengthening its methodological approach. The evaluation metrics and statistical tests are well-chosen for the research questions. The literature citations support the technical approaches, drawing from relevant work in adversarial machine learning, domain adaptation, and fairness. One minor limitation is that some of the thresholds (e.g., for MMD) are left to be determined during the research rather than being theoretically justified in advance. Overall, the technical approach is well-founded and demonstrates a strong understanding of both machine learning methods and healthcare applications."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps, though it involves several ambitious components. The partnership with three healthcare systems for collecting case studies is realistic but will require significant coordination and data sharing agreements. The retrospective analysis of deployment failures and literature review are straightforward and achievable. The stakeholder interviews (30+ clinicians) are manageable but will require careful recruitment and IRB approval. The experimental simulations using adversarial attacks and synthetic shifts are technically feasible with existing methods. However, there are some potential challenges: (1) accessing detailed failure data from healthcare institutions may be difficult due to privacy concerns and reluctance to share negative outcomes, (2) the comprehensive four-dimensional analysis of each case study will be time-intensive, and (3) developing a clinically useful decision tool will require extensive validation. The proposal acknowledges these challenges implicitly but could benefit from more explicit discussion of contingency plans. Overall, the research is implementable with current resources and methods, though it will require significant effort and coordination."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in healthcare AI with far-reaching implications. Understanding why deep learning systems fail in clinical settings is essential for improving patient safety, reducing healthcare costs, and building trust in medical AI. The proposed taxonomy of healthcare-specific DL failures would fill a significant gap in the literature and provide actionable guidance for researchers, clinicians, and healthcare administrators. The decision support tool for evaluating AI implementation risks could directly impact clinical practice by helping healthcare organizations make better-informed decisions about AI adoption. The research also has potential policy implications, potentially influencing regulatory frameworks for medical AI validation. Beyond healthcare, the multi-dimensional framework could be adapted to analyze DL failures in other high-stakes domains. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and provides a convincing case for how the research outcomes would address current challenges in deploying healthcare AI. The significance is further enhanced by the focus on both technical and human factors in AI implementation."
