    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the ICBINB workshop's focus on challenges in applied deep learning by examining failure modes in healthcare applications. The proposal incorporates all four required elements: (1) healthcare use cases, (2) deep learning solutions from literature, (3) negative outcomes in deployment, and (4) investigation of why these solutions fail. The methodology thoroughly explores the key challenges identified in the literature review, including underspecification, deployment workflow issues, adversarial vulnerabilities, data distribution shifts, and clinical workflow integration. The proposal's multi-dimensional assessment approach (dataset shifts, demographic disparities, workflow integration, interpretability) directly maps to the research idea's framework for analyzing healthcare-specific DL failures."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and broken down into manageable sub-objectives. The methodology section is particularly strong, with detailed explanations of each dimension of analysis and the corresponding evaluation metrics. Mathematical formulations are presented clearly with proper notation and context. However, there are a few areas where the proposal could be more concise - some sections contain redundant information, and the technical details occasionally become dense, which might challenge readers without a strong ML background. The proposal would benefit from more visual aids or diagrams to illustrate the relationships between different components of the framework."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty in its approach to systematically categorizing and addressing healthcare-specific DL failures. While the individual components (dataset shift analysis, fairness evaluation, workflow integration) have been studied separately, the integration of these dimensions into a unified framework specifically for healthcare applications is innovative. The proposal goes beyond existing work by connecting theoretical challenges (underspecification, adversarial attacks) to real-world clinical deployment contexts. The development of a healthcare-specific failure taxonomy and corresponding mitigation strategies represents a valuable contribution. However, some of the proposed methods (e.g., SHAP, Grad-CAM for interpretability, adversarial training) are relatively standard in the field, and the proposal could benefit from more cutting-edge techniques or novel combinations of existing approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for evaluating dataset shifts, fairness metrics, and adversarial robustness are correctly presented and appropriate for the research questions. The experimental design includes appropriate baseline models, testing protocols, and evaluation metrics. The proposal effectively leverages established techniques from the literature (e.g., domain adaptation, counterfactual explanations) while adapting them to healthcare contexts. The multi-dimensional approach ensures comprehensive coverage of different failure modes. The case study collection methodology is well-designed, with clear inclusion criteria and analysis protocols. However, there are some potential limitations in the statistical analysis approach - for example, the proposal could benefit from more discussion of statistical power considerations for subgroup analyses, especially given the often limited sample sizes in healthcare datasets."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and methodologies. The use of existing datasets (CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR, NIH ChestX-ray14) and established model architectures (DenseNet-121, Transformers) increases practicality. The case study collection approach is realistic, drawing from published literature, expert interviews, and developer reports. However, the scope is ambitious - analyzing 50+ case studies across four healthcare subdomains, implementing multiple evaluation frameworks, and developing synthetic data generators represents a substantial workload. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed timeline and resource allocation plan. Additionally, some aspects may face practical challenges: obtaining IRB approval for clinician interviews, accessing proprietary healthcare AI systems for analysis, and simulating realistic clinical workflows. The proposal acknowledges these challenges but could provide more specific contingency plans."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in healthcare AI research with potentially high impact. Understanding and mitigating DL failures in healthcare applications has direct implications for patient safety, clinical outcomes, and healthcare resource allocation. The proposed taxonomy and mitigation toolkit could significantly improve the reliability and trustworthiness of AI systems in clinical settings, potentially accelerating safe adoption. The work directly contributes to the ICBINB workshop's goal of systematically collecting and analyzing real-world failure cases, with healthcare representing a particularly high-stakes domain where failures can have severe consequences. The open-source toolkit and standardized risk-assessment framework would provide valuable resources for both researchers and healthcare organizations. The proposal effectively bridges theoretical ML research with practical clinical implementation challenges, addressing a significant need in the field."
