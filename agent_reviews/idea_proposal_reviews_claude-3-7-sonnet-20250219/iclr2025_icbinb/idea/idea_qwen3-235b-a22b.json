        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The X-Cause proposal aligns exceptionally well with the ICBINB workshop's focus on challenges in applied deep learning. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes: identifying failure modes in real-world deployments, investigating underlying reasons across domains, and providing systematic analysis of why deep learning solutions don't work as promised in literature. The proposal specifically targets the four required elements: it addresses use cases across multiple domains (healthcare, robotics, fairness), acknowledges solutions from DL literature, focuses on negative outcomes, and most importantly, provides a structured framework for investigating why these failures occur. The cross-domain approach also perfectly matches the workshop's goal of finding common patterns in challenges across different fields."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The X-Cause proposal is well-articulated with a clear structure that outlines the motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The three-step approach (compiling failure cases, applying XAI methods, validating root causes) provides a concrete methodology. The proposal clearly defines its scope and deliverables (taxonomy of failure patterns, diagnostic reports, benchmark dataset, and software tool). However, there are some minor ambiguities that could benefit from further elaboration - for instance, the specific XAI techniques to be used could be more precisely defined beyond the examples given, and the exact methodology for validating root causes through counterfactual analysis could be more detailed. Overall, the core concept is immediately understandable with only minor areas needing refinement."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The X-Cause framework demonstrates significant originality by combining two established fields - explainable AI and root cause analysis - in a novel way specifically targeted at diagnosing deep learning failures. While both XAI and RCA exist independently, their systematic integration for failure analysis in deep learning deployments represents an innovative approach. The proposal's emphasis on creating a structured taxonomy of failure patterns across domains is particularly novel, as most current approaches to troubleshooting ML failures are ad hoc and domain-specific. The idea of creating a benchmark dataset of annotated failure cases also represents a fresh contribution to the field. While it builds on existing XAI techniques rather than inventing entirely new ones, the application and integration of these techniques for systematic failure diagnosis represents a meaningful innovation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The X-Cause proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it faces some implementation challenges. The use of established XAI techniques (SHAP, ICE) is practical, and the creation of a failure case repository is achievable through collaboration with domain experts. However, several aspects require careful consideration: (1) Obtaining a diverse and representative set of real-world failure cases may be challenging, as organizations might be reluctant to share failures; (2) Validating root causes through counterfactual analysis can be computationally intensive and methodologically complex; (3) Creating a taxonomy that generalizes across diverse domains will require significant expertise and iteration. While these challenges are substantial, they don't render the project infeasible - rather, they suggest the need for careful planning, sufficient resources, and potentially a phased implementation approach."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The X-Cause framework addresses a critical gap in the field of applied deep learning. As the task description highlights, there is currently no systematic platform for collecting and analyzing real-world failure cases, despite their importance for advancing the field. This proposal directly addresses this need by providing a structured methodology for diagnosing failures and extracting generalizable insights. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) Practical value for practitioners who can use the framework to diagnose and mitigate failures; (2) Scientific contribution through the taxonomy of failure patterns and benchmark dataset; (3) Educational value in helping researchers understand common pitfalls; and (4) Cross-domain knowledge transfer by identifying patterns that span different application areas. The work could significantly influence how the ML community approaches failure analysis and potentially lead to more robust deep learning systems in real-world deployments."
