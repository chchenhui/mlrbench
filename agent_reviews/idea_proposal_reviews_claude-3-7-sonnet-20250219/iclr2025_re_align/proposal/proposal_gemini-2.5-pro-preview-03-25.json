    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the central theme of the Re-Align workshop by exploring when and why systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. The proposed Prototypical Contrastive Alignment (PCA) framework faithfully implements the two-stage method outlined in the research idea: joint clustering to define prototypes followed by contrastive learning to align DNN representations with brain-derived prototypes. The proposal thoroughly incorporates the literature, citing all relevant papers from the review and building upon their findings. It specifically addresses the identified challenges (lack of interpretable anchors, limited generalizability, semantic integration, measurement difficulties, and intervention mechanisms) and positions PCA as a solution to these issues. The only minor inconsistency is that some references in the proposal (e.g., Kriegeskorte & Raichle, 2008; Cichy et al., 2016) were not in the provided literature review, but these are appropriate supplementary citations that strengthen the proposal rather than detract from its consistency."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the background, identifies gaps in existing research, and presents the proposed solution. The methodology section is particularly strong, providing detailed explanations of the two-stage PCA framework, including mathematical formulations of the prototypical contrastive loss and clear descriptions of the experimental design. The expected outcomes and impact sections clearly articulate the anticipated contributions and their significance. The proposal uses appropriate technical language while remaining accessible. There are a few areas that could benefit from slight refinement: (1) some mathematical notations could be more consistently defined (e.g., the relationship between z_i and d_{l,i}), (2) the transition between prototype identification and the PCA loss could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some implementation details regarding the joint clustering approach could be further elaborated. However, these are minor issues in an otherwise very clear proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant originality by introducing a novel framework that combines several existing concepts in an innovative way. The core innovation lies in adapting prototypical contrastive learning (PCL) specifically for brain-DNN alignment, creating a dual-purpose approach that serves both as an alignment metric and an intervention mechanism. While the individual components (prototypical learning, contrastive losses, joint clustering) exist in the literature, their integration into a unified framework for representational alignment is novel. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by emphasizing the interpretable nature of the prototypes and the active steering of representations during training, addressing limitations of post-hoc alignment methods. The approach of using brain-derived prototypes as anchors for DNN training represents a fresh perspective on alignment. The novelty is somewhat constrained by its reliance on established methods like PCL, RSA, and clustering techniques, but the application context and the specific formulation for brain-DNN alignment provide sufficient originality to make this a notably innovative proposal."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with a methodology that builds on established techniques in representation learning, neuroscience, and machine learning. The mathematical formulation of the PCA loss is rigorous and properly derived from prototypical contrastive learning. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The proposal demonstrates awareness of potential challenges and includes strategies to address them. However, there are some areas where the theoretical foundations could be strengthened: (1) the justification for why joint clustering would yield meaningful prototypes across such different representational spaces (brain and DNN) could be more thoroughly developed, (2) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the dimensionality mismatch between brain and DNN representations, (3) there's limited discussion of how the approach handles noise inherent in neural recordings, and (4) the statistical validation of the prototype interpretations could be more rigorously defined. These limitations don't undermine the overall soundness of the approach but do represent areas where the theoretical foundations could be strengthened."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with existing resources, technologies, and methodologies. The use of publicly available datasets (fMRI, EEG, image datasets) and standard DNN architectures (ResNet, ViT) makes the data collection and model training aspects practical. The two-stage methodology is clearly defined with specific implementation steps. The evaluation metrics are well-established and appropriate for measuring alignment. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) the quality and availability of paired brain-DNN datasets with sufficient samples for robust clustering may be limited, (2) the joint clustering of such disparate representational spaces may be more difficult in practice than described, potentially requiring extensive preprocessing or alignment, (3) the computational resources needed for fine-tuning large DNNs with the additional PCA loss could be substantial, and (4) the interpretation of prototypes may be subjective and challenging to validate quantitatively. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do represent practical hurdles that would need to be carefully addressed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in representational alignment research and has the potential for substantial impact across multiple domains. Its significance is particularly high because it directly tackles the central questions posed by the Re-Align workshop, offering both theoretical and practical contributions. The PCA framework provides a novel solution to several key challenges in the field: it offers interpretable anchors through prototypes, enables direct intervention through the contrastive loss, provides a unified metric for measuring alignment, and potentially enhances generalizability. The potential applications span machine learning (more human-like AI systems), neuroscience (insights into shared computational principles), and cognitive science (understanding representational structures). The proposal could significantly advance our understanding of when and why systems learn aligned representations, and how to systematically influence this alignment. The framework also provides a foundation for future research directions, including extensions to other modalities, temporal dynamics, and hierarchical alignment. The potential to bridge disciplines and provide concrete tools for both measuring and intervening on alignment makes this proposal highly significant for the field."
