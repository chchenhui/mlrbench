    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the central theme of the Re-Align workshop by focusing on when and why intelligent systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. The proposal incorporates the key questions from the task description, particularly developing robust alignment measures and systematically increasing representational alignment between biological and artificial systems. The methodology follows closely with the research idea of using prototypical contrastive learning to create semantic anchors for alignment. The literature review challenges are well-addressed: interpretable anchors (via prototypes), generalizability (cross-domain testing), and intervention mechanisms (contrastive loss). The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions semantic information integration, the proposal could more explicitly discuss how the prototypes capture semantic structure."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the two-stage approach (prototype extraction followed by DNN fine-tuning) is well-defined. The mathematical formulations are precise and accompanied by explanatory text. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the joint clustering algorithm and the resulting prototypes could be more explicitly connected to semantic meaning, (2) the process for updating prototypes during training (mentioned briefly as computing prototypes every 5 epochs) could be elaborated, and (3) some technical details about the dimensionality reduction steps could be more thoroughly explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The integration of prototypical contrastive learning (from Li et al., 2020) with brain-DNN alignment is innovative and addresses limitations in current alignment methods. The two-stage approach of joint clustering followed by prototype-based fine-tuning represents a fresh perspective on the alignment problem. However, the core technical components (prototypical contrastive learning, joint clustering, alignment regularization) all exist in prior work, as acknowledged in the literature review. The novelty lies in their combination and application to the brain-DNN alignment problem, rather than in fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical frameworks. The proposal extends existing work rather than introducing an entirely groundbreaking approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established methods. The mathematical formulation of the prototypical contrastive loss is rigorous and builds on the well-established InfoNCE framework. The joint clustering approach for prototype extraction is methodologically sound, with clear steps for dimensionality reduction, clustering, and projection. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, multiple evaluation metrics, and statistical analysis plans. The proposal acknowledges potential limitations and includes hyperparameter tuning strategies. The only minor weaknesses are: (1) limited discussion of how the joint clustering might be affected by the different dimensionalities and statistical properties of brain vs. DNN representations, (2) potential challenges in the interpretation of prototypes when derived from joint spaces, and (3) the assumption that the prototypes will remain stable and meaningful across training epochs."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The data requirements (fMRI or EEG recordings paired with stimuli) are substantial but achievable using existing datasets like NSD. The computational requirements for extracting prototypes and fine-tuning DNNs are reasonable with modern GPU resources. The methodology builds on established techniques (K-means clustering, contrastive learning, RSA/CKA) that have proven implementations. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) the quality of prototypes depends heavily on the alignment of brain and DNN spaces prior to clustering, which may require careful preprocessing, (2) the periodic recomputation of prototypes during training adds complexity to the optimization process, (3) the interpretability evaluation requires human subject studies which add logistical complexity, and (4) the extension to auditory domains may face additional challenges due to the temporal nature of the stimuli. These challenges are manageable but will require careful implementation and possibly additional resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in the field of representational alignment and has the potential for significant impact. By providing both a measurement framework and an intervention mechanism, it goes beyond descriptive analysis to enable prescriptive model design. The expected outcomes include improved alignment metrics, enhanced neural predictivity, and interpretable semantic anchors, all of which would advance the field. The broader impact section convincingly argues for applications in neuroscience (compact semantic scaffolds), machine learning (alignment regularizers), and cognitive science (theories of concept representation). The ethical considerations regarding human-aligned AI are thoughtful and relevant. The contribution to the Re-Align community through open-source code and precomputed prototype libraries would facilitate broader adoption. While the impact is likely to be significant within the representational alignment community, it may not be transformative for the broader fields of AI or neuroscience, as it builds incrementally on existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new paradigms."
