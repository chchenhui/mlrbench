    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the central theme of the Re-Align workshop by exploring when and why intelligent systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. The proposal's focus on Prototypical Contrastive Alignment (PCA) as both a measurement and intervention mechanism addresses multiple workshop questions, particularly around developing robust alignment measures and systematically increasing/decreasing alignment. The methodology follows closely the two-stage approach outlined in the research idea, implementing joint clustering and prototypical contrastive loss. The proposal also builds upon the literature review, incorporating concepts from prototypical contrastive learning (Li et al., 2020) and addressing key challenges identified in the review such as the lack of interpretable anchors and limited generalizability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the two-stage approach, including data collection, joint clustering, and the prototypical contrastive loss function. The mathematical formulation of the loss function adds precision to the explanation. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined, providing a clear roadmap for implementation and assessment. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific neural datasets to be used could be more precisely defined, (2) the exact clustering algorithms and their parameters could be more detailed, and (3) the relationship between the prototypes and semantic meaning could be further elaborated. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining prototypical contrastive learning with brain-DNN alignment in a novel way. While prototypical contrastive learning exists (Li et al., 2020) and brain-DNN alignment has been studied extensively, the integration of these approaches to create semantic prototypes as alignment anchors is innovative. The two-stage method that jointly clusters neural and DNN representations before applying a contrastive loss is a fresh approach to the problem. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by building directly on existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The mathematical formulation of the contrastive loss is similar to established contrastive learning approaches, with modifications for the brain-DNN alignment context. The proposal offers a new combination and application of existing techniques rather than a groundbreaking new paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The approach is grounded in established techniques from contrastive learning, representation alignment, and clustering. The mathematical formulation of the prototypical contrastive loss is technically sound and well-justified. The experimental design includes appropriate controls and evaluation metrics that directly address the research objectives. The proposal also acknowledges the need for dimensionality reduction before clustering, which is important for high-dimensional neural and DNN representations. The evaluation plan includes multiple complementary metrics (neural predictivity, task transfer, behavioral alignment) that provide a comprehensive assessment of the method's effectiveness. One minor limitation is that the proposal could more thoroughly address potential challenges in joint clustering of very different types of data (neural responses vs. DNN activations), including how to handle different dimensionalities, noise characteristics, and sampling rates. Overall, the technical approach is well-founded and rigorous."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with existing technologies and methodologies. The data collection process relies on established neuroimaging techniques and pre-trained DNNs, both of which are readily available. The clustering and contrastive learning components use well-understood algorithms that have been implemented in various contexts. The evaluation metrics are standard in the field and can be computed with existing tools. However, there are some feasibility challenges: (1) collecting paired neural and DNN data at scale may be resource-intensive, particularly for fMRI data; (2) joint clustering of heterogeneous data types may require careful parameter tuning and validation; (3) the computational resources needed for fine-tuning large DNNs with the proposed loss function could be substantial. The proposal does not fully address these practical challenges or provide contingency plans. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is implementable with current technology and expertise, making it a feasible research direction."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant gap in representational alignment research by providing both interpretable anchors and intervention mechanisms. This directly responds to key challenges identified in the literature review and the workshop's central questions. If successful, the PCA method would offer several important contributions: (1) a more interpretable way to measure alignment between biological and artificial systems; (2) a mechanism to systematically modify alignment during training; (3) insights into the semantic structures that underlie both neural and DNN representations. These contributions could advance our understanding of both biological and artificial intelligence and potentially lead to more human-like AI systems. The impact extends across multiple disciplines, including neuroscience, cognitive science, and machine learning, aligning perfectly with the interdisciplinary nature of the workshop. The proposal also has practical applications in developing AI systems that better align with human cognition and behavior. The significance is somewhat limited by focusing primarily on visual representations rather than addressing alignment across multiple domains, but overall, the potential impact is substantial."
