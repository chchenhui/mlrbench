    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the central theme of representational alignment between biological and artificial systems, focusing on when and why intelligence systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. The proposed prototypical contrastive learning approach is fully consistent with the research idea of creating semantically meaningful 'anchor' vectors shared across systems. The methodology incorporates both measurement (alignment metrics) and intervention mechanisms (prototypical contrastive loss), which aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus. The proposal also builds upon the literature review, addressing key challenges like the lack of interpretable anchors, limited generalizability, and insufficient intervention mechanisms. The comprehensive experimental design addresses multiple questions posed in the task description, including how to systematically increase/decrease alignment and the implications of varying degrees of alignment on performance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The methodology is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations and clear descriptions of each component. The joint prototype discovery process, prototypical contrastive alignment loss, and experimental design are all articulated with sufficient detail to understand the approach. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly delineated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact process for mapping between the prototype spaces of brain and DNN representations could be more explicitly defined, (2) some technical details about the joint clustering algorithm could be further elaborated, and (3) the relationship between the prototype-based alignment score and existing metrics could be more precisely formulated. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is well-articulated and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The integration of prototypical contrastive learning with brain-DNN alignment represents a fresh approach that differs from existing methods. While prototypical contrastive learning exists (as cited in the literature review), and various alignment metrics have been proposed, the combination of these approaches into a unified framework that serves both as an alignment metric and an intervention mechanism is innovative. The joint prototype discovery process that simultaneously clusters both neural and DNN activations while maximizing correspondence is particularly novel. The proposal also introduces new metrics (Prototype Alignment Score and Prototype Distribution Alignment) that offer interpretable alternatives to existing approaches. While building on established concepts from contrastive learning and representational similarity analysis, the proposal recombines these elements in a novel way that addresses specific limitations of current approaches to representational alignment."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with a methodology that builds on established techniques in machine learning and neuroscience. The mathematical formulations for the joint clustering approach and prototypical contrastive alignment loss are technically correct and well-justified. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering multiple dimensions of evaluation including alignment metric assessment, intervention effectiveness, task performance impact, and interpretability analysis. However, there are some areas where the theoretical foundations could be strengthened: (1) the statistical properties of the proposed alignment metrics are not fully analyzed, (2) the potential biases in the joint clustering approach are not thoroughly addressed, and (3) the relationship between the prototype-based approach and existing theoretical frameworks for representational alignment could be more rigorously established. Additionally, while the proposal acknowledges the need for appropriate statistical tests, the specific statistical methodology for some experiments could be more precisely defined."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The data collection methods, including fMRI, EEG, and behavioral data, are standard in the field and achievable with the described participant numbers. The computational requirements (4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs) are substantial but reasonable for the proposed experiments. The implementation using PyTorch and existing model architectures is practical. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the joint clustering of neural and DNN representations may be challenging due to the high dimensionality and different statistical properties of these data types, (2) the collection of paired neural and DNN data for 1,000 stimuli is ambitious and may face practical challenges in participant recruitment and data quality, and (3) the optimization of multiple hyperparameters (number of prototypes, balancing parameters, etc.) may require extensive computational resources. While these challenges are significant, they do not fundamentally undermine the feasibility of the approach, and the proposal acknowledges the need for ablation studies to address some of these concerns."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in the field of AI and neuroscience: developing interpretable and actionable methods for aligning representations between biological and artificial systems. The significance is high for several reasons: (1) it provides a framework that bridges the gap between post-hoc analysis and active intervention in representational learning, (2) it offers interpretable anchors (prototypes) that can help explain what aspects of representations are aligned or misaligned, (3) it has potential applications in multiple domains including more human-compatible AI systems, improved brain-computer interfaces, and educational tools, and (4) it contributes to the broader goal of developing AI systems that complement human intelligence by sharing similar representational structures. The proposal directly addresses the central questions posed in the workshop task description and has the potential to advance our understanding of shared computational principles between biological and artificial systems. The expected outcomes include both scientific insights and practical methodological contributions that could influence future research in this interdisciplinary field."
