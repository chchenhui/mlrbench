        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the central theme of when and why intelligence systems learn aligned representations by proposing a novel framework for measuring alignment without ground truth. The idea specifically tackles the question of developing 'more robust and generalizable measures of alignment that work across different domains and types of representations' through its causal intervention approach. It also addresses the question about the extent to which representational alignment indicates shared computational strategies by focusing on functional equivalence rather than surface-level similarities. The proposal is highly relevant to the workshop's focus on advancing measurement approaches beyond current metrics, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description as an area of interest."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The problem statement is well-articulated, identifying limitations in current representational alignment metrics. The proposed solution follows a logical structure with a clear three-step methodology: (1) identifying minimal interventions, (2) applying equivalent interventions to the second system, and (3) measuring functional changes. The concept of a 'causal alignment space' is introduced and its purpose is explained. The only minor ambiguity is in the specific implementation details - while the general approach is clear, the exact mathematical formulation of how to measure 'analogous functional changes' or construct the 'causal alignment space' could benefit from further elaboration. Overall, the idea is well-defined and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates high originality by fundamentally shifting the paradigm of representational alignment from static correlation-based methods to dynamic causal intervention approaches. This represents a significant departure from conventional techniques mentioned in the task description (e.g., the ongoing debates about representational similarity metrics). The focus on functional equivalence rather than structural similarity is particularly innovative, as it addresses a fundamental limitation in current approaches. The concept of a 'causal alignment space' appears to be a novel contribution to the field. The approach also innovatively sidesteps the ground truth problem that plagues existing methods. While some elements build upon existing causal inference concepts, their application to representational alignment constitutes a fresh and original perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea presents some significant challenges. While the conceptual framework is sound, implementing causal interventions in complex representational spaces may prove difficult. Identifying 'minimal interventions' that cause specific representational changes requires a deep understanding of the systems being compared, which may not always be available, especially for biological systems. The approach assumes we can make equivalent interventions across different systems, which may be technically challenging when comparing fundamentally different architectures (e.g., neural networks vs. brains). Additionally, measuring 'analogous functional changes' across different representational formats would require developing new metrics, which brings back some of the measurement challenges the approach aims to solve. The idea is implementable with considerable effort and may require substantial methodological development, but these challenges do not render it impossible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research idea is very high. If successful, it would address a fundamental limitation in current representational alignment research that is explicitly highlighted in the task description - the lack of consensus on appropriate metrics. By shifting focus from structural similarity to functional equivalence, the approach could reveal deeper insights about computational strategies shared between biological and artificial systems, which is directly mentioned as a question of interest in the task description. The proposed framework could potentially resolve ongoing debates about measurement approaches mentioned in the hackathon component of the workshop. Furthermore, the causal intervention approach could provide a more principled foundation for alignment research across disciplines, potentially unifying perspectives from machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science. The impact would extend beyond theoretical advances to practical applications in understanding and designing AI systems that better align with human cognition."
