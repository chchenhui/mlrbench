    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description on Intrinsically-Motivated and Open-Ended Learning (IMOL). The proposal directly addresses the core challenge of developing autonomous agents that can self-generate goals and acquire skills without predefined learning signals. The hierarchical intrinsic motivation system with dual signals (learning progress and novelty) perfectly matches the IMOL framework mentioned in the task. The focus on preventing catastrophic forgetting and enabling lifelong skill composition directly addresses the task's emphasis on 'integrating incremental learning of skills and knowledge over longer periods of time.' The evaluation in procedurally generated environments also aligns with the need for generalization to different domains. The only minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions neurosymbolic memory, it could have elaborated more on how this connects to developmental psychology perspectives mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a well-structured framework with clear components: a hierarchical goal generation system with a meta-controller and lower-level policy, dual intrinsic motivation signals, neurosymbolic memory for skill storage, and mechanisms to prevent forgetting. The relationships between these components are logically explained, and the evaluation approach is specified. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration - particularly how the neurosymbolic memory would be implemented, the exact mechanisms for skill composition, and more specific metrics for measuring 'learning progress' and 'novelty'. The proposal provides a solid conceptual framework but leaves some implementation details that would need to be specified in a full research plan."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The hierarchical approach to intrinsic goal generation that combines both learning progress and novelty as complementary signals is innovative. While intrinsic motivation has been explored before (as mentioned in the task description), the specific dual-signal hierarchical architecture that separates exploration and exploitation goals represents a fresh approach. The integration of neurosymbolic memory with dynamic modularity for skill composition is particularly novel, as most existing approaches don't effectively combine symbolic and neural representations for lifelong learning. The focus on preventing catastrophic forgetting through diversity-based replay prioritization is also innovative. However, some individual components (like learning progress and novelty as intrinsic rewards) have precedents in the literature cited in the task description, which is why it doesn't receive a perfect novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate feasibility challenges. While the individual components (intrinsic motivation, hierarchical policies, memory systems) have established implementations, integrating them into a cohesive system presents significant challenges. The neurosymbolic memory with dynamic modularity is conceptually appealing but technically complex to implement effectively. Preventing catastrophic forgetting in open-ended learning remains an unsolved problem in the field. The evaluation in procedurally generated 3D environments like Minecraft would require substantial computational resources and engineering effort. The proposal is theoretically sound but would likely require multiple research iterations and significant technical expertise to fully realize. The complexity of combining all these components into a working system that achieves the stated goals of lifelong learning without forgetting makes this ambitious but challenging to implement in a single research project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research idea is exceptionally high. If successful, it would address one of the fundamental challenges in artificial intelligence: creating systems that can autonomously learn, adapt, and build upon their skills over time without human intervention. This directly addresses the task description's emphasis on developing 'autonomous lifelong learning machines.' The potential applications mentioned (lifelong learning robots and adaptive educational agents) have profound implications for real-world AI deployment. The framework could bridge the gap between current narrow AI systems and more general-purpose agents capable of open-ended learning. By tackling catastrophic forgetting and enabling skill composition, the research addresses critical bottlenecks in current approaches. The work could significantly advance the IMOL field by providing both theoretical insights and practical implementations of intrinsically motivated learning systems."
