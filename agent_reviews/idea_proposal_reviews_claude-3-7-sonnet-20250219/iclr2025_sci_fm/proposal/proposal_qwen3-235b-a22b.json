    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the SCI-FM workshop's goal of democratizing foundation model research through a federated distillation approach that enables collaborative training without centralizing data. The proposal incorporates key elements from the literature review, including communication efficiency techniques (from ProFe), privacy preservation methods, and strategies to handle data heterogeneity (from FedFed). The methodology section thoroughly explains how the framework addresses the challenges identified in both the task description and literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the task description mentions multi-modal foundation models as a focus area, the proposal primarily emphasizes vision and language tasks without extensive discussion of other modalities like audio or chemistry."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical details are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations, and the framework components are explained systematically. The experimental design section provides specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics, making the research plan concrete and understandable. Figures are referenced (though only placeholders are provided), which would enhance clarity when completed. The only areas that could benefit from further clarification are: (1) more detailed explanation of how the proxy dataset construction would work in practice, especially for diverse domains, and (2) clearer distinction between the roles of the server and clients in the aggregation process. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible with only minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining federated learning with knowledge distillation in a novel way. The use of a proxy dataset as a universal reference for knowledge aggregation is an innovative approach to address data heterogeneity while maintaining privacy. The proposal builds upon existing work in federated distillation but introduces several fresh elements: (1) the three-component architecture with local specialization, proxy-based distillation, and efficient aggregation; (2) the specific techniques for mitigating data heterogeneity through domain-invariant regularization; and (3) the communication-efficient knowledge transfer methods. However, many of the individual components draw from existing techniques in the literature (e.g., logit quantization, temperature scaling in distillation), and the overall approach shares similarities with works like ProFe and FedFed mentioned in the literature review. While not entirely groundbreaking, the proposal offers a meaningful new combination of existing concepts with clear distinctions from prior work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for local specialist training, knowledge distillation, and aggregation are well-defined and theoretically sound. The loss functions are properly specified with clear explanations of their components and purposes. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges like data heterogeneity and privacy concerns, providing specific techniques to address them (e.g., differential privacy, domain-invariant regularization). The communication efficiency analysis is quantitatively supported with formulas for data transmission. The only areas that could benefit from additional rigor are: (1) more detailed theoretical analysis of convergence guarantees under the proposed framework, and (2) clearer justification for the specific hyperparameter choices. Overall, the methodology is robust and well-justified with only minor gaps."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components and implementation strategies. The experimental design specifies concrete datasets (CIFAR-100-Federated, WikiText-103) that are readily available and appropriate for the task. The computational requirements, while substantial, are within reach of academic research environments (AWS p3.16xlarge GPU clusters). The proposal includes a scalability test with up to 100 clients, which is ambitious but achievable. The implementation challenges are acknowledged and addressed through specific techniques like logit quantization and top-K selection to reduce communication costs. However, there are some aspects that may present practical difficulties: (1) constructing an effective proxy dataset that generalizes well across heterogeneous clients could be challenging; (2) coordinating multiple institutions with different data distributions and privacy requirements would require significant effort; and (3) the differential privacy implementation might impact model performance more than anticipated. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the proposal impractical, but rather represent manageable risks that would require careful handling during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in foundation model research: the democratization of FM training by enabling collaborative development without centralizing data or requiring massive computational resources. This directly aligns with the SCI-FM workshop's mission of fostering open science and accessibility in AI research. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) enabling smaller institutions to participate in FM development; (2) reducing computational and communication costs in distributed training; (3) preserving privacy while leveraging diverse data sources; and (4) producing more efficient models suitable for edge deployment. The expected outcomes include concrete deliverables like an open-source codebase and benchmark performance improvements over existing methods. The broader impact section convincingly argues for the proposal's potential to influence open-data policies and accelerate FM deployment in resource-constrained environments. While the impact may be initially limited to specific domains and model types, the framework has the potential for wider application across various foundation model architectures and tasks."
