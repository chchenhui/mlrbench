    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice' topic from the task description, specifically focusing on the Edge of Stability phenomenon and continuous approximations of training trajectories. The proposal follows through on all aspects of the research idea, developing a theoretical framework for EoS dynamics and designing an adaptive optimization algorithm. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, building upon Cohen et al.'s empirical observations of EoS, Arora et al.'s mathematical analysis, and the continuous-time stochastic gradient descent approaches from the other cited papers. The proposal addresses all five key challenges identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined with bullet points, and the mathematical formulations are precise and well-presented. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the continuous-time modeling, stability analysis, adaptive algorithm design, and experimental validation. The pseudocode for the EoS-SGD algorithm is particularly helpful for understanding the implementation. The timeline and milestones section provides a clear roadmap for the research. However, some technical aspects, such as the derivation of the corrected stability boundary and the exact mechanism of noise estimation, could benefit from further elaboration to ensure complete clarity for readers without specialized background."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant originality in several aspects. The development of a continuous-time SDE framework specifically tailored to capture EoS phenomena goes beyond existing work. The proposed corrected stability boundary that accounts for gradient noise and higher-order terms in the loss expansion represents a novel theoretical contribution. The EoS-SGD algorithm, which dynamically tracks local curvature and noise to select step sizes, is an innovative approach to optimization. While the proposal builds upon existing work on EoS and continuous approximations, it offers fresh perspectives and new combinations of these concepts, particularly in the integration of curvature estimation, noise adaptation, and stability analysis into a unified framework. The application to large-scale vision and language models also extends the novelty to practical implementations."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded in established mathematical principles. The continuous-time modeling via SDEs is a recognized approach for analyzing discrete-time algorithms, and the stability analysis builds on classical theory with appropriate extensions. The derivation of the corrected stability boundary appears theoretically justified, though some of the mathematical claims would need rigorous proof in the actual research. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, metrics, and statistical significance testing. However, there are some potential gaps in the theoretical foundations: the assumption that the SDE approximation is accurate up to O(η²) may not hold in highly non-convex landscapes, and the single-vector power iteration for Hessian eigenvalue estimation might be insufficient for complex loss surfaces. Additionally, while the proposal mentions convergence theorems, it doesn't fully address how the algorithm handles saddle points or plateaus in the loss landscape."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with a reasonable timeline and clear milestones. The methodology is implementable with current technology and computational resources, and the experimental design is realistic. The use of PyTorch with custom CUDA kernels for Hessian matvecs is a practical approach. The 24-month timeline allows sufficient time for theoretical development, implementation, and empirical validation. However, there are some feasibility concerns: estimating top Hessian eigenvalues in real-time for billion-parameter models may be computationally expensive, even with the proposed approximations. The power iteration or Lanczos method with k=2 steps might not converge quickly enough for accurate eigenvalue estimation in complex landscapes. Additionally, the proposed experiments on large-scale models (ResNet-50, ViT, Transformer, BERT) would require substantial computational resources, which might be challenging to secure."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in modern deep learning: the gap between optimization theory and practice, particularly for large-scale models. If successful, this research would have substantial impact on both theoretical understanding and practical training of deep neural networks. The potential 2-3× speedups in training time and 20-30% reduction in energy consumption would significantly reduce the computational and environmental costs of training foundation models. The theoretical contributions would advance our understanding of optimization dynamics in deep learning, while the practical algorithm could democratize access to large-scale model training for researchers with limited computational resources. The open-source implementation and practical guidelines would ensure broad adoption and impact across the field. The work directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging theory and practice in modern machine learning."
