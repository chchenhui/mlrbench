    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice' topic from the task description, specifically focusing on the Edge of Stability phenomenon and continuous approximations of training trajectories. The proposal fully embraces the research idea of developing a theoretical framework for EoS dynamics and designing an adaptive optimization algorithm. It thoroughly incorporates the literature review, citing all the key papers and building upon their findings. The proposal's methodology, which combines theoretical analysis with practical algorithm design, is consistent with the goal of bridging theory and practice in modern machine learning. The only minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions the potential impact on democratizing access to large models, it could have more explicitly connected to the 'Theory for Foundation Models' section of the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The introduction provides comprehensive context, the problem statement is precise, and the research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section is particularly strong, with detailed explanations of the theoretical analysis approaches, the proposed AdaEoS algorithm design, and the experimental validation plan. The mathematical formulations are correctly presented and explained. The only areas that could benefit from slight refinement are: (1) some technical details of the SDE approximations could be more precisely formulated, (2) the exact frequency of λ_max estimation could be more concretely specified rather than saying 'periodically', and (3) the proposal could more clearly articulate the specific modifications needed to adapt the approach to different optimizer types beyond SGD with momentum (e.g., Adam variants)."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The core innovation—an adaptive optimizer that explicitly targets the Edge of Stability regime—represents a fresh approach to optimization algorithm design. While the EoS phenomenon has been observed and analyzed (Cohen et al., 2021; Arora et al., 2022), the proposal goes beyond existing work by developing a practical algorithm that actively exploits this phenomenon. The integration of efficient curvature estimation with learning rate adaptation specifically designed for EoS dynamics is original. The use of continuous-time approximations (SDEs) to analyze EoS behavior also offers a novel theoretical perspective. The proposal isn't entirely groundbreaking, as it builds upon existing concepts (power iteration for eigenvalue estimation, adaptive learning rates), but it combines and extends these ideas in innovative ways. The approach of dynamically adjusting learning rates based on stability indicators rather than fixed schedules represents a meaningful departure from standard practice."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with a solid theoretical basis. The mathematical formulation of the EoS condition (η λ_max ≈ 2) is correct, and the proposed power iteration method for eigenvalue estimation is well-established. The learning rate adaptation rule is reasonable and grounded in the stability analysis. However, there are some areas where the theoretical rigor could be strengthened: (1) The SDE approximation discussion acknowledges limitations but doesn't fully resolve how to address them for the high learning rate regime characteristic of EoS; (2) The convergence analysis section outlines an approach but doesn't provide detailed proof strategies for the adaptive setting; (3) The proposal acknowledges the challenges of analyzing non-convex landscapes but doesn't fully specify what simplifying assumptions might be necessary for the theoretical analysis. The experimental methodology is comprehensive and well-designed, with appropriate benchmarks, baselines, and evaluation metrics, which partially compensates for the theoretical uncertainties."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, but with some implementation challenges. The core components—power iteration for eigenvalue estimation, learning rate adaptation, and integration with standard optimizers—are all implementable with current technology and methods. The experimental validation on standard benchmarks (ImageNet, WikiText-103) is realistic. However, several practical challenges may affect feasibility: (1) The computational overhead of eigenvalue estimation, even with efficient methods, could be significant for very large models, potentially offsetting some of the convergence speed gains; (2) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the challenge of determining the optimal frequency for λ_max estimation; (3) The stability of the adaptive learning rate mechanism in highly non-convex landscapes might require more careful tuning than anticipated; (4) The target of 2-3x speedup is ambitious and may be difficult to achieve consistently across different model architectures and tasks. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is implementable, and the proposal includes reasonable strategies to address potential issues, such as using stochastic mini-batches for Hessian estimation and incorporating damping factors in the adaptation rule."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in modern machine learning: the inefficiency and high computational cost of training large-scale models. If successful, the research could have substantial impact in several ways: (1) Theoretical advancement in understanding EoS dynamics would fill an important gap in optimization theory for deep learning; (2) The proposed AdaEoS optimizer could significantly reduce training time and computational resources for large models, with the target 2-3x speedup representing a meaningful improvement; (3) By reducing training costs, the work could democratize access to state-of-the-art AI capabilities beyond well-resourced organizations; (4) The approach aligns with 'Green AI' by potentially reducing the energy footprint of training massive models. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on a specific optimization phenomenon (EoS) rather than addressing the full range of challenges in deep learning theory, but within its scope, the potential impact is considerable. The proposal clearly articulates how the research connects to broader challenges in the field and how the outcomes would benefit both theoretical understanding and practical applications."
