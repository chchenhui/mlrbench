    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice' topic from the task description, specifically focusing on the Edge of Stability phenomenon and continuous approximations of training trajectories. The proposal follows through on the research idea of developing a theoretical framework for EoS dynamics and designing an adaptive optimization algorithm. It builds upon the literature review by extending the work on EoS (Cohen et al.), implicit regularization (Arora et al.), and continuous-time SGD (Wang et al., Lugosi et al.). The methodology section clearly incorporates these elements, proposing both theoretical analysis via SDE models and a practical algorithm (CAEO) that addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented with sufficient technical detail, including mathematical formulations and algorithmic steps. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear specifications of datasets, models, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The expected outcomes are also well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The connection between the SDE model and the CAEO algorithm could be more explicitly explained; (2) Some technical terms (e.g., 'metastable regime') are used without full explanation; and (3) The proposal could more clearly articulate how the theoretical contributions will directly inform the practical algorithm development."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining continuous-time SDE modeling with curvature-aware optimization for EoS dynamics. The CAEO algorithm represents a novel approach to stabilizing training in the EoS regime through dynamic learning rate adjustment based on Hessian eigenvalue estimation. The integration of theoretical analysis (via Fokker-Planck equations) with practical algorithm design is innovative. However, the core components build upon existing approaches (SDE modeling, Hessian-based optimization, power methods for eigenvalue estimation), rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The proposal extends and combines these existing approaches in a thoughtful way, but doesn't represent a revolutionary departure from current methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for the SDE model and the CAEO algorithm are well-defined and theoretically grounded. The connection to existing literature is thorough, with clear references to established work on EoS dynamics, continuous-time approximations, and Hessian estimation. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The proposal acknowledges computational challenges and offers solutions (e.g., using KFAC or Hutchinson's estimator for efficient Hessian approximation). The theoretical analysis via Fokker-Planck equations is mathematically sound. However, some assumptions about the relationship between discrete SGD and continuous SDE approximations could benefit from more rigorous justification, particularly regarding when such approximations are valid in non-convex settings."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The CAEO algorithm is implementable with current technology, and the experimental design uses established datasets and models. The computational efficiency considerations (e.g., reducing Hessian estimation complexity from O(d²) to O(d)) demonstrate awareness of practical constraints. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) Accurate Hessian eigenvalue estimation for very large models (billions of parameters) may still be computationally expensive, even with the proposed approximations; (2) The experimental validation on large-scale models (ViT-H/14, BERT-XXL) requires significant computational resources; and (3) The theoretical analysis of non-convex landscapes via SDEs may prove mathematically challenging. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present notable implementation hurdles that could affect the timeline or scope of results."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in modern machine learning: understanding and harnessing the Edge of Stability phenomenon to improve training efficiency for large-scale models. The potential impact is substantial, with claimed 1.5-3.5× speedups over baselines for large models and up to 40% reduction in carbon emissions compared to naive hyperparameter tuning. These outcomes would directly address the computational waste problem highlighted in the task description. The theoretical contributions would advance our understanding of optimization dynamics in deep learning, potentially bridging the gap between theory and practice. The practical algorithm could benefit researchers with limited computational resources, promoting equity in AI research. The significance is somewhat tempered by the incremental nature of the improvements (speedups rather than order-of-magnitude advances) and the focus on a specific optimization phenomenon rather than a broader theory of deep learning."
