    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice' topic from the task description, specifically focusing on the Edge of Stability phenomenon and continuous approximations of training trajectories. The proposal expands on the research idea by providing a detailed methodology for developing a theoretical framework to characterize the EoS regime and design an adaptive optimization algorithm. It also incorporates insights from the literature review, particularly building upon the work on gradient descent at the edge of stability and continuous-time approximations of SGD. However, it could have more explicitly addressed how the proposed work extends beyond the existing literature, particularly the papers by Cohen et al. and Arora et al. that already explore the EoS phenomenon."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-structured and articulates its objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes clearly. The introduction provides sufficient background and context, and the methodology section outlines a logical research design with specific algorithmic steps. The mathematical formulations are presented clearly, including the SDE model for the SGD process and the characterization of the EoS regime. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration. For instance, the proposal mentions 'low-cost Hessian approximations' without specifying what these approximations are or how they will be implemented. Similarly, the experimental design could be more detailed about the specific datasets, model architectures, and baseline algorithms that will be used for evaluation. The proposal would also benefit from a clearer explanation of how the theoretical insights will be translated into practical algorithm design."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates moderate novelty by combining continuous approximations of gradient dynamics with adaptive optimization techniques to address the EoS phenomenon. The idea of using SDEs to model the training process and incorporating curvature estimates for adaptive learning rate adjustment is interesting. However, much of this builds directly on existing work cited in the literature review. The papers by Cohen et al. and Arora et al. already explore the EoS phenomenon, while the papers on continuous-time SGD provide frameworks for analyzing gradient dynamics. The proposal does not clearly articulate what specific novel theoretical insights or algorithmic innovations it will contribute beyond these existing works. The adaptive optimization algorithm mentioned seems to be an incremental improvement rather than a fundamentally new approach. The proposal would be stronger if it more clearly identified the gaps in current understanding and specified how its approach differs from or extends existing methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established theoretical foundations. The use of SDEs to model the SGD process is well-justified, and the characterization of the EoS regime using the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian is consistent with existing literature. The methodology outlines a logical approach to data collection, algorithm development, and evaluation. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved. The proposal does not provide detailed justification for why the continuous approximation will be valid for the discrete-time gradient dynamics in deep learning. It also does not address potential challenges in estimating the Hessian for large-scale models or how the proposed algorithm will handle non-convexity and saddle points. Additionally, while the proposal mentions statistical analysis for comparing algorithms, it does not specify what statistical methods will be used or how statistical significance will be determined. These gaps in the technical foundations somewhat limit the overall soundness of the proposal."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, but there are significant challenges that are not fully addressed. Training various deep learning models, especially large-scale ones, requires substantial computational resources, and the proposal does not discuss how these resources will be obtained or managed. The development of an adaptive optimization algorithm based on curvature estimates is technically challenging, particularly for large models where computing the Hessian or its approximations can be computationally expensive. The proposal mentions 'low-cost Hessian approximations' but does not specify what these are or demonstrate their feasibility for large-scale models. The timeline for the research is not provided, making it difficult to assess whether the proposed work can be completed within a reasonable timeframe. Additionally, the claim of achieving '2-3x speedups in training large-scale models' is ambitious and would require substantial empirical validation, which may be challenging to achieve in practice."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in modern deep learning: the gap between optimization theory and practice, particularly in the context of large-scale models. If successful, the research could lead to more efficient training algorithms that reduce computational costs, energy consumption, and time requirements for training large modelsâ€”a critical need in the era of billion-parameter foundation models. The theoretical insights into the EoS phenomenon could advance our understanding of deep learning optimization, while the practical algorithm could have immediate applications in training large-scale models. The potential impact on reducing the environmental footprint of AI research and democratizing access to large model training is substantial. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and connects them to broader concerns in the field. However, the significance would be even higher if the proposal more explicitly addressed how the work would generalize beyond specific model architectures or optimization scenarios."
