    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge identified in the task description: 'Foundation models are trained on data without actions. How to overcome this limitation from both the dataset and modeling perspectives?' The Sim2Act framework specifically targets this gap by generating action-conditioned data through simulated environments. The proposal maintains fidelity to the original research idea, expanding it with detailed methodology for data generation, model architecture, and iterative improvement. It incorporates relevant concepts from the literature review, such as leveraging foundation models for decision-making (Yang et al., 2023), self-supervised learning approaches (Johnson & Lee, 2023), and addressing sim-to-real transfer challenges (Green & Black, 2024). The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions contrastive predictive coding, the proposal uses a slightly different contrastive learning approach (InfoNCE)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and broken down into four concrete goals. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the data generation process, model architecture, training approach, and experimental design. Mathematical formulations for the loss functions are precisely defined. The proposal effectively communicates complex technical concepts using appropriate terminology and notation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for how the VLM proposes actions during exploration could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the contrastive and behavior cloning losses could be better explained, and (3) the uncertainty quantification method for identifying under-explored tasks is mentioned but not fully elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to bridging the 'actions gap' in foundation models. The core innovation lies in the self-supervised generation of action-conditioned data through foundation model-guided exploration in simulated environments, creating a bootstrapping process where increasingly capable policies generate increasingly complex data. This approach differs from traditional reinforcement learning methods that learn from scratch and from standard fine-tuning approaches for foundation models. The multi-modal integration of vision, language, and action through a unified architecture is also innovative. However, several components build upon existing techniques: the contrastive learning approach is similar to established methods, the behavior cloning objective is standard, and the use of simulation for data generation has precedents in the literature (e.g., White & Brown, 2023). The proposal represents a novel combination and application of these techniques rather than a fundamentally new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The approach is grounded in established machine learning techniques, including transformer architectures, contrastive learning, and behavior cloning. The mathematical formulations for the loss functions are correctly specified, and the training procedure follows sound principles. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, diverse tasks, and relevant metrics for evaluation. The iterative policy improvement process is well-justified as a means to bootstrap increasingly complex behaviors. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and offers mitigation strategies. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the choice of weighting parameter λ between the contrastive and behavior cloning losses is not discussed, (2) the theoretical guarantees for the iterative improvement process are not provided, and (3) the rejection sampling approach for filtering low-reward episodes could introduce bias if not carefully designed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction with realistic implementation paths, though it involves significant technical challenges. The data generation pipeline leverages existing simulation environments (Habitat, AI2-THOR, MuJoCo) and foundation models, making the initial setup achievable. The model architecture builds on established components (ViT, pretrained LLMs, transformers) that have demonstrated success in related tasks. The iterative policy improvement approach provides a practical mechanism for scaling up complexity. However, several aspects present feasibility concerns: (1) generating 1M+ high-quality vision-language-action triplets across 100+ tasks will require substantial computational resources, (2) the sim-to-real transfer, while addressed through domain randomization, remains a significant challenge that has proven difficult in prior work, (3) the integration of multiple foundation models (for vision, language, and potentially exploration) introduces complexity in training and deployment, and (4) the real-world validation on robotic platforms (UR5, Boston Dynamics Spot) requires specialized hardware and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental limitation in current foundation models—their inability to reason about actions and make sequential decisions—which is a critical barrier to their application in robotics, autonomous systems, and embodied AI. Successfully bridging this 'actions gap' would represent a significant advancement in the field, enabling more capable and generalizable AI systems. The expected outcomes include both methodological contributions (the Sim2Act framework) and practical artifacts (a large-scale dataset and multi-modal foundation model) that could benefit the broader research community. The industrial impact through reduced reliance on real-world data collection is substantial, potentially accelerating the deployment of robotic systems in various domains. The societal benefits in healthcare, logistics, and hazardous environments are also noteworthy. However, the significance is somewhat tempered by the focus on specific robotic applications rather than a universal solution for all decision-making contexts, and the expected 30% improvement over baselines, while substantial, may not represent a transformative leap in performance."
