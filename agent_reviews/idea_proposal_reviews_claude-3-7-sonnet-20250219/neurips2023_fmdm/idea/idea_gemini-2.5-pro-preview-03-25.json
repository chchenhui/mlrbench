        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description. It directly addresses one of the key challenges mentioned: 'Foundation models are trained on data without actions. How to overcome this limitation from both the dataset and modeling perspectives?' The proposal to incorporate action prediction during pretraining is highly relevant to the intersection of foundation models and decision making. It also touches on other aspects mentioned in the task description, such as improving sample efficiency, enhancing generalization, and adapting foundation models to control and planning tasks. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some other aspects like human interaction or theoretical understanding."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly with a well-defined problem statement, approach, and expected outcomes. The concept of using inverse dynamics prediction to infer actions from state transitions is explained concisely. The technical approach involving masked prediction objectives is specific enough to understand the implementation direction. However, there are some minor ambiguities: the exact architecture of the inverse dynamics model is not fully specified, and the details of how the action predictions will be integrated into the foundation model pretraining pipeline could be elaborated further. The proposal could also benefit from more specificity about evaluation metrics and baselines."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel combination of inverse dynamics modeling with foundation model pretraining. While inverse dynamics models have been used in robotics and reinforcement learning, and masked prediction is common in foundation models, their combination for action-aware pretraining of vision-language models represents a fresh approach. The innovation lies in bridging the gap between passive observation data and interactive decision-making by inferring actions from unlabeled video data. However, the core techniques (inverse dynamics modeling and masked prediction) are established methods being applied in a new context rather than fundamentally new algorithms or frameworks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is quite feasible with current technology and resources. The required datasets (Ego4D, Something-Something) already exist, and the technical components (foundation models, inverse dynamics models, masked prediction) are well-established. The approach doesn't require collecting new labeled data, which is a significant practical advantage. Implementation challenges exist but are manageable: training an accurate inverse dynamics model from video data may be difficult for complex interactions, and the computational resources required for pretraining foundation models are substantial. However, these challenges don't fundamentally threaten the feasibility of the approach."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental limitation of current foundation models - their inability to understand action-effect relationships crucial for decision-making tasks. If successful, it could significantly advance the application of foundation models to robotics, embodied AI, and interactive systems by improving sample efficiency and few-shot adaptation capabilities. The potential impact extends across multiple domains where understanding physical interactions and affordances is important. The significance is enhanced by the fact that it tackles a core challenge explicitly mentioned in the task description. However, it remains to be seen whether the inferred actions will be accurate enough to provide the desired grounding in interaction dynamics."
