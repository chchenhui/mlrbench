    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description. It directly addresses the intersection of foundation models (specifically LLMs) and sequential decision making, which is the core focus of the task. The proposal tackles key challenges mentioned in the task description: leveraging foundation models for long-term planning, adapting language models to action-based tasks, and creating hierarchical structures that enable efficient decision making. The idea specifically addresses how to 'structure environments and tasks so that vision language foundation models can benefit traditional decision making applications' and how to overcome the limitation that foundation models are 'trained on data without actions.' The bidirectional translation mechanism is particularly relevant to bridging the gap between LLM knowledge and actionable decisions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (RL's struggle with long-horizon planning and sample complexity), the proposed solution (hierarchical RL with LLM-based high-level controllers), and the mechanism for implementation (bidirectional translation between semantic and action spaces). The evaluation approach is also well-defined, mentioning specific benchmarks. The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details of how the contrastive learning would be implemented and how exactly the bidirectional translation mechanism would work in practice. While these are understandable limitations in a brief proposal, slightly more technical specificity would have earned a perfect score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining hierarchical reinforcement learning with LLM latent spaces in a structured way. The bidirectional translation mechanism between semantic and action spaces appears to be a fresh approach. However, the core concept of using LLMs for high-level planning in RL has been explored in recent literature (e.g., LLM-based planners, language as abstraction in RL). What distinguishes this proposal is the specific focus on the latent space of LLMs and the contrastive learning approach for translation. While not completely groundbreaking, it offers a meaningful extension to existing approaches and combines elements in a way that could yield new insights."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible with current technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The proposed benchmarks (ALFWorld and RoboSuite) are established environments suitable for this research. The hierarchical structure is implementable using existing RL frameworks, and LLMs are readily available. The main challenge lies in the bidirectional translation mechanism between LLM latent spaces and action spaces, which would require careful design and significant computational resources. Training this system end-to-end might be complex, and the contrastive learning approach would need paired demonstrations that might be difficult to obtain at scale. These challenges are substantial but surmountable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant problem in the field: bridging the gap between the semantic understanding of foundation models and the structured decision-making capabilities needed for complex sequential tasks. If successful, this approach could substantially reduce the sample complexity of RL in complex environments, enable more effective transfer learning across tasks, and create more capable embodied agents. The potential impact extends to robotics, autonomous systems, and interactive AI assistants. The significance is particularly high given the growing interest in leveraging foundation models for decision-making tasks, as highlighted in the task description. The main limitation to its significance is that it focuses primarily on language models rather than addressing the full spectrum of foundation models mentioned in the task."
