    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description. It directly addresses one of the key questions posed in the task: 'Foundation models are trained on data without actions. How to overcome this limitation from both the dataset and modeling perspectives?' The proposal to create action-aware pretraining for foundation models is perfectly aligned with the workshop's focus on bridging foundation models and decision-making. It also touches on several specific topics mentioned, including applying foundation models to traditional decision-making problems, learning multi-modal policies, and creating new datasets that apply foundation models to decision-making problems. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some other aspects like long-horizon reasoning or theoretical understanding, but these could emerge as outcomes of the research."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation clearly identifies the gap in current foundation models (lack of action-oriented training data). The main idea articulates a concrete approach: integrating action dynamics into foundation models through pretraining on multi-modal datasets that pair observations with action sequences. The proposal specifies potential self-supervised objectives (masked action prediction, contrastive alignment) and data sources (simulators, D4RL). The expected outcomes are also well-defined. The only minor ambiguities are in the specific architectural details of how the foundation model would be adapted to incorporate actions and the exact formulation of the self-supervised objectives, which would need further elaboration in a full proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by proposing a systematic approach to address the 'action gap' in foundation models. While there have been attempts to use foundation models in decision-making contexts, the specific focus on pretraining with action-paired data as a general approach is relatively fresh. The proposal combines existing techniques (self-supervised learning, contrastive methods) in a new context (action prediction). However, it builds upon existing work in both foundation models and reinforcement learning rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or architectures. The concept of using synthetic data from simulators to augment real-world datasets for action learning is pragmatic but not revolutionary. The novelty lies more in the systematic integration of these approaches to solve an important problem rather than in developing entirely new methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and resources. The proposal leverages existing foundation model architectures and well-established self-supervised learning techniques. The data sources mentioned (simulators, D4RL benchmarks) are readily available. The approach of using masked prediction and contrastive learning has proven effective in other domains. The fine-tuning with reinforcement learning is a standard practice. The main implementation challenges would be in collecting and curating high-quality action-paired datasets from real-world scenarios and ensuring that the foundation model effectively learns the relationship between observations and actions. The computational resources required would be substantial but not prohibitive for research labs with access to GPU clusters. Overall, the technical components exist, and the innovation is in their combination and application."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical limitation in current foundation models that prevents their effective use in decision-making domains. If successful, it would have far-reaching implications across multiple fields. In robotics, it could dramatically reduce the sample complexity for learning new tasks, enabling more rapid deployment of robots in diverse environments. In autonomous systems, it could improve planning capabilities by leveraging the broad knowledge encoded in foundation models. The approach could also bridge the gap between the data-rich world of passive perception (images, text) and the interactive world of decision-making, potentially leading to more general AI systems. The significance is particularly high because it addresses a fundamental limitation rather than an incremental improvement, and the potential applications span numerous domains including healthcare, autonomous driving, and industrial automation."
