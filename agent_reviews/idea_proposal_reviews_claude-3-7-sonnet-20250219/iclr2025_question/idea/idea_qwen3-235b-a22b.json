    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the core challenge of detecting and mitigating hallucinations in generative models while preserving creative capabilities, which is explicitly mentioned in the task. The proposed self-limited reasoning approach offers a scalable and computationally efficient method for uncertainty quantification during generation, which is another key requirement. The idea also connects to decision-making under risk for safer deployment, particularly in high-stakes domains mentioned in the task (legal/medical). The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address multimodal systems or communication of uncertainty to stakeholders, though the core technical approach could potentially be extended to these areas."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity and structure. The motivation clearly establishes the problem of hallucinations in autoregressive models. The main idea articulates a three-part approach: (1) using a lightweight auxiliary network to predict token-level uncertainty, (2) using uncertainty scores to gate knowledge retrieval, and (3) employing a hybrid training objective. The expected outcomes and applications are also well-defined. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as how exactly the 'fact-free generative mode' differs from knowledge retrieval mode in implementation, and how the context-adaptive threshold is determined. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to hallucination mitigation. While uncertainty quantification in LLMs is an active research area, the proposed method introduces several innovative elements: (1) the concept of 'knowledge disengagement' during generation rather than post-hoc verification, (2) the use of contrastive input perturbations to derive entropy bounds, and (3) the dynamic transitioning between knowledge retrieval and fact-free generation modes. This represents a meaningful departure from existing approaches that rely on external knowledge sources or verification mechanisms. The idea isn't entirely without precedent—uncertainty estimation and controlled text generation have been explored—but the specific combination and application to hallucination control during generation appears to be a fresh contribution to the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears feasible with current technology and methods, though it presents moderate implementation challenges. The lightweight auxiliary network for uncertainty prediction is a practical approach that addresses computational efficiency concerns. Using existing benchmarks like TruthfulQA and FActScore for evaluation is sensible. However, several aspects raise feasibility questions: (1) training an effective uncertainty predictor that works across diverse contexts may be challenging, (2) the hybrid training objective combining language modeling, uncertainty calibration, and RL could be complex to optimize effectively, and (3) ensuring that the 'fact-free generative mode' preserves linguistic coherence while avoiding factual claims requires careful design. These challenges are substantial but likely surmountable with appropriate research effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is exceptionally high. Hallucination mitigation is one of the most pressing challenges in deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains. The proposed approach addresses a fundamental limitation of current models—their inability to recognize and signal their own knowledge boundaries during generation. If successful, this work could substantially improve the reliability of LLMs in critical applications like healthcare, legal advice, and education, where factual accuracy is paramount. The lightweight design ensures practical applicability to real-world systems. Moreover, the approach offers a new paradigm for thinking about hallucination control by embedding knowledge limitations into the generation process itself, potentially influencing the broader direction of research in this area. The impact would extend beyond academic interest to practical deployment considerations."
