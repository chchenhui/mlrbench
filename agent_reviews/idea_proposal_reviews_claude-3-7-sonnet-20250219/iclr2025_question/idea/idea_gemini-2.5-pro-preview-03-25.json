        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD) idea aligns excellently with the task's focus on uncertainty quantification in LLMs. It directly addresses the workshop's call for methods to detect and mitigate hallucinations while preserving capabilities. The proposal specifically tackles the question of 'How can we create scalable and computationally efficient methods for estimating uncertainty in large language models?' by integrating uncertainty monitoring into the decoding process. It also addresses the task's concern about hallucination mitigation, which is one of the explicit topics mentioned. The only minor gap is that it doesn't extensively discuss communicating uncertainty to stakeholders or multimodal applications, though these are secondary aspects of the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, proposed solution, and evaluation plan. The UAD mechanism is explained with specific implementation details (monitoring token-level uncertainty metrics, intervention strategies) that make the approach concrete and understandable. The three intervention strategies are clearly delineated. However, there are some minor ambiguities that could be clarified: how exactly the 'dynamically adjusted threshold' would be determined, what specific uncertainty metrics would be prioritized among the options mentioned, and more details on the computational requirements of implementing these uncertainty estimates during generation. These are relatively minor points in an otherwise well-defined proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea shows notable originality by integrating uncertainty quantification directly into the decoding process, rather than treating it as a post-hoc analysis. This real-time intervention approach represents a fresh perspective on hallucination mitigation. The combination of uncertainty monitoring with multiple intervention strategies (constraining, re-ranking, or signaling) is innovative. However, each individual component (uncertainty estimation via entropy/ensemble methods, retrieval-augmented generation, etc.) builds upon existing techniques in the field. The innovation lies primarily in the integration and application of these techniques within the decoding loop, rather than introducing fundamentally new uncertainty quantification methods. It's an innovative combination and application of existing concepts rather than a groundbreaking new approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Uncertainty estimation techniques like predictive entropy and ensemble disagreement are established methods. Integrating these into the decoding process is technically achievable, especially for research teams with access to LLM internals. However, there are implementation challenges that merit consideration: (1) Computing uncertainty metrics at each decoding step may introduce significant computational overhead, especially for methods like MC dropout or ensembles; (2) The retrieval component for factual evidence would require careful design to avoid introducing latency; (3) Determining appropriate dynamic thresholds for intervention is non-trivial and would require substantial experimentation. These challenges don't render the idea infeasible, but they do represent meaningful hurdles that would require careful engineering and optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in LLM deployment: hallucination mitigation. Successfully reducing hallucinations while maintaining generation quality would significantly enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs in high-stakes domains mentioned in the task description (healthcare, law, etc.). The approach could lead to meaningful contributions by: (1) Establishing a framework for real-time uncertainty monitoring in generative models; (2) Providing empirical evidence on which uncertainty metrics best correlate with hallucination risk; (3) Demonstrating practical intervention strategies that balance factuality with fluency. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical deployment considerations, addressing a major barrier to LLM adoption in critical applications. The significance is high but not maximal because similar goals are being pursued by many research teams, and the approach builds on existing uncertainty quantification methods rather than proposing fundamentally new ones."
