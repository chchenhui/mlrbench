        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The LatentFlow idea aligns excellently with the task's focus on uncertainty quantification and hallucination detection in LLMs. It directly addresses the call for 'scalable and computationally efficient methods' by proposing a lightweight approach that fits compact normalizing flows to frozen layer activations. The proposal targets the core challenge of detecting hallucinations while providing uncertainty estimates, which is central to the task description. It also considers practical deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law, which the task specifically mentions. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address multimodal systems or communication of uncertainty to stakeholders, which are secondary aspects of the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The LatentFlow idea is presented with strong clarity. The problem statement is well-defined (hallucinations in LLMs), and the proposed solution is articulated in a structured manner with clear methodology steps. The technical approach using normalizing flows to model activation distributions is explained concisely. The distinction between low-confidence outputs and confident hallucinations is a nuanced point that's well-articulated. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific architecture of the normalizing flows, how exactly the layerwise log-densities are aggregated, and what calibration process would be used for the thresholds. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "LatentFlow presents a novel approach by applying normalizing flows to model the distribution of internal LLM activations for uncertainty quantification. While normalizing flows themselves are established techniques, their application to layerwise activations for hallucination detection represents an innovative combination. The idea of distinguishing between low-confidence outputs and confident hallucinations through fusion of different signals is also relatively novel. However, the core concept of analyzing internal representations for out-of-distribution detection has precedents in the literature, and other approaches have explored activation patterns for uncertainty estimation. The novelty lies more in the specific implementation and combination of techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The LatentFlow approach is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Normalizing flows are well-established models with existing implementations. The proposal works with frozen LLM weights, avoiding the need for expensive retraining of foundation models. The method requires only unlabeled corpora for training the flows, which is readily available. The computational overhead during inference appears manageable since the flows are described as 'compact.' The layerwise approach also allows for parallel computation. The main implementation challenges would be in designing flows that can effectively model high-dimensional activation spaces and determining the optimal aggregation strategy for the layerwise signals. The calibration process on hallucination benchmarks is also feasible but would require careful experimental design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is substantial. Hallucination detection and uncertainty quantification are critical challenges for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains. The proposed method addresses a genuine need for lightweight, real-time uncertainty estimation that could enable safer AI deployment. If successful, this approach could have broad impact across applications where trust in model outputs is essential. The layerwise analysis could also provide valuable insights into how and where hallucinations emerge in the model's reasoning process. The significance is enhanced by the method's potential scalability to very large models where traditional UQ approaches become prohibitively expensive. However, it remains to be seen whether the approach can capture all types of hallucinations and uncertainties that arise in complex real-world scenarios."
