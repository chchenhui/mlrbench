    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of hallucination mitigation in LLMs through uncertainty quantification during the generation process, which is a central focus of the workshop task. The methodology incorporates all key elements from the original idea, including token-level uncertainty metrics (predictive entropy, MC dropout variance, ensemble disagreement) and the three intervention strategies (evidence-constrained sampling, uncertainty-based re-ranking, and unreliability tagging). The proposal also acknowledges and addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as computational overhead, threshold calibration, and evaluation metrics. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions uncertainty-aware training, the proposal focuses exclusively on decoding-time interventions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and conclusion. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described with precise mathematical formulations. The experimental design, including datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly outlined. The dynamic intervention threshold mechanism is particularly well-explained with mathematical formulation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the three uncertainty estimation methods could be more explicitly compared, (2) the evidence-constrained sampling approach could provide more details on how retrieved documents are processed and integrated, and (3) the proposal could more clearly explain how the three intervention strategies would be selected or combined during generation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating uncertainty quantification directly into the decoding process for real-time hallucination mitigation, which is a relatively underexplored approach according to the literature review. The dynamic intervention thresholds that adapt based on historical uncertainty represent an innovative contribution, as does the combination of multiple intervention strategies (evidence-constrained sampling, uncertainty-based re-ranking, and unreliability tagging). However, many of the individual components, such as MC dropout, ensemble methods, and retrieval-augmented generation, build upon existing techniques in the literature. The proposal synthesizes these known approaches in a novel framework rather than introducing fundamentally new uncertainty estimation or mitigation techniques. The integration of these components into a unified, real-time decoding framework is where the novelty primarily lies."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The uncertainty estimation methods (predictive entropy, MC dropout variance, ensemble disagreement) are well-established in the literature and appropriately formulated. The dynamic threshold adaptation mechanism is mathematically sound and addresses the challenge of calibration identified in the literature review. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies will help isolate the contributions of individual components. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional theoretical justification: (1) the relationship between the different uncertainty metrics and their correlation with actual hallucination risk, (2) the theoretical guarantees or limitations of the proposed interventions, and (3) a more detailed analysis of potential failure modes. Overall, the proposal is technically sound but could strengthen its theoretical foundations in these specific areas."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The uncertainty estimation techniques (predictive entropy, MC dropout, ensembles) are well-established and implementable. The evaluation datasets and metrics are readily available. The proposal acknowledges computational overhead as a challenge and offers mitigation strategies like distillation and caching. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) running multiple forward passes or ensemble models during generation could significantly impact inference speed, potentially making real-time applications challenging; (2) the evidence-constrained sampling approach requires an efficient retrieval system that can operate within the decoding loop, which could be computationally expensive; (3) calibrating dynamic thresholds across different domains and tasks may require extensive hyperparameter tuning; and (4) the expected 20-40% reduction in hallucination rates is ambitious and may be difficult to achieve consistently across all benchmarks. Despite these challenges, the proposal includes reasonable mitigation strategies and acknowledges the trade-offs involved."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in LLM deployment: hallucination mitigation in real-time. This has significant implications for high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal analysis, and education, as mentioned in both the task description and the proposal. By integrating uncertainty quantification directly into the decoding process, the approach could enable safer deployment of LLMs while preserving their generative capabilities. The expected outcomes include not just a reduction in hallucination rates but also open-source implementations and benchmarks that could benefit the broader research community. The proposal also contributes to the theoretical understanding of uncertainty in generative models, which aligns with the workshop's goals. While the approach is significant, it represents an incremental rather than transformative advance, as it builds upon existing uncertainty quantification methods rather than fundamentally reimagining them. Nevertheless, the practical impact of successfully implementing this framework could be substantial for improving LLM reliability."
