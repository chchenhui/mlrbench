    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on uncertainty quantification in foundation models and hallucination mitigation. The proposed Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD) framework precisely implements the core idea from the research idea document, incorporating token-level uncertainty monitoring and the three intervention strategies mentioned (constraint via retrieval, re-ranking, and warning token injection). The proposal thoroughly engages with the literature review, citing relevant works and addressing the key challenges identified (computational overhead, threshold calibration, evaluation metrics, etc.). The methodology section provides detailed mathematical formulations for the uncertainty quantification methods mentioned in the literature. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions multimodal systems in the introduction (referencing the workshop description), it doesn't specifically address multimodal uncertainty in its methodology or experiments."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-structured. It presents a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly enumerated and well-defined. The methodology section provides precise mathematical formulations for uncertainty quantification metrics and a clear algorithmic outline of the UAD framework. The experimental design is thoroughly detailed, including models, baselines, comparative analyses, and evaluation metrics. The proposal uses appropriate technical language while remaining accessible, with key concepts explained and contextualized. Figures or diagrams might have enhanced clarity further, particularly for visualizing the UAD algorithm workflow, but this is a minor limitation in an otherwise crystal-clear proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by integrating several innovative aspects. The core contribution—incorporating uncertainty quantification directly into the decoding loop for proactive hallucination mitigation—represents a fresh approach compared to post-hoc methods. The proposal innovatively combines multiple UQ techniques (entropy, MC dropout, lightweight ensembles) with various intervention strategies in a unified framework. However, as acknowledged in the literature review, similar uncertainty-aware decoding concepts have been explored previously (e.g., Smith et al., 2023; Kim & O'Connor, 2023). While the proposal extends these ideas with more sophisticated intervention mechanisms and a comprehensive evaluation framework, it builds incrementally on existing approaches rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm. The integration of retrieval-based constraints with uncertainty-driven interventions is perhaps the most novel aspect of the proposal."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness. The uncertainty quantification methods are well-founded in statistical theory and prior work (e.g., Gal & Ghahramani's Bayesian interpretation of dropout). The mathematical formulations for entropy, MC dropout variance, and ensemble disagreement are correctly presented. The UAD algorithm is logically structured and technically feasible. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, ablation studies, and evaluation metrics. The proposal acknowledges potential limitations and trade-offs (e.g., computational overhead of MC dropout). The evaluation methodology is rigorous, incorporating both automatic metrics and human evaluation. One area that could be strengthened is the theoretical analysis of how the proposed interventions might affect the model's generation distribution and whether they could introduce new biases. Additionally, more details on the implementation of the lightweight ensemble approach would have enhanced technical rigor."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The implementation of entropy-based uncertainty is straightforward and computationally efficient. The use of publicly available pre-trained LLMs and established benchmarks (NQ, TruthfulQA, XSum) is practical. The evaluation metrics are well-defined and accessible. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) The MC dropout approach requires multiple forward passes, potentially creating significant computational overhead for large models; (2) The retrieval-based intervention requires an external knowledge source and retriever, adding complexity; (3) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the challenge of threshold calibration; (4) Human evaluation for factual consistency is resource-intensive. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present implementation hurdles that would need to be carefully managed. The proposal could have benefited from more explicit discussion of computational requirements and potential optimizations to address these concerns."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI reliability—hallucination in LLMs—that has significant implications for deploying these models in high-stakes domains. The potential impact is substantial: (1) Enhancing factual reliability of LLM outputs would enable safer deployment in critical applications like healthcare and legal analysis; (2) The proactive approach to hallucination mitigation could be more efficient than post-hoc methods; (3) The insights into token-level uncertainty quantification would advance understanding of LLM reliability; (4) The open-source implementation would provide practical tools for the research community. The significance is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of the advance (building on existing uncertainty-aware decoding approaches) and the focus on specific tasks (QA, summarization) rather than a broader range of applications. Nevertheless, given the importance of the hallucination problem and the practical nature of the proposed solution, the potential impact is considerable."
