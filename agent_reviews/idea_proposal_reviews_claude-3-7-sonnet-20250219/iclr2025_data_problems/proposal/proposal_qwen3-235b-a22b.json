    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the DATA-FM workshop's focus on data curation for foundation models, particularly in multimodal settings. The proposal builds upon the literature review by extending DataInf's influence estimation approach to multimodal contexts, addressing HEMM's identified challenges in cross-modal reasoning, and incorporating fairness considerations similar to Chameleon. The methodology clearly implements the two-stage pipeline outlined in the research idea (clustering followed by influence estimation). The proposal comprehensively covers multiple workshop themes including data curation, societal impacts, economics of data, and benchmarking."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections for introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formulations. The two-stage pipeline (cross-modal semantic clustering and hierarchical influence estimation) is logically presented with detailed explanations of each component. The experimental design includes specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the exact mechanism for updating influence scores during training and more specifics on the fairness violation detection process. The proposal occasionally uses technical terminology without full explanation, which might reduce clarity for readers unfamiliar with influence functions or Hessian approximations."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. It extends influence estimation techniques (previously applied mainly to single-modal models or parameter-efficient fine-tuning) to full multimodal foundation models. The hierarchical clustering approach to influence estimation is innovative, offering a new balance between computational efficiency and granularity. The combination of cross-modal semantic clustering with influence-based curation represents a novel pipeline not previously explored in the literature. The proposal's centroid-based proxy for influence estimation and the scoring function that balances influence, diversity, and redundancy are original contributions. While it builds upon existing work like DataInf and FLAVA, it substantially advances these approaches by addressing the unique challenges of multimodal data curation at scale."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with appropriate mathematical formulations and methodological choices. The influence function approximation builds on established theoretical foundations, and the clustering approach is justified by the need for computational efficiency. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and appropriate for the research objectives. However, there are some potential weaknesses in the technical approach. The diagonal low-rank approximation of the Hessian might not capture all relevant interactions between parameters, especially in multimodal settings. The proxy influence calculation based on centroids assumes that centroids adequately represent all cluster members, which may not hold for heterogeneous clusters. The proposal acknowledges these limitations implicitly but could benefit from a more explicit discussion of potential failure modes and mitigation strategies."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with careful consideration of computational constraints. The hierarchical clustering strategy and low-rank Hessian approximation address the scalability challenges of influence estimation for large models. The implementation details are specific and realistic, with appropriate hyperparameter choices and optimization strategies. The selected datasets (COCO, HowTo100M) are standard and accessible. However, there are some feasibility concerns. The computational requirements for influence estimation, even with the proposed optimizations, may still be substantial for trillion-parameter models. The proposal mentions a 60% data reduction target while maintaining 95% accuracy, which is ambitious and may require significant hyperparameter tuning. The timeline for implementing and evaluating the full pipeline across multiple datasets is not specified, raising questions about the practical execution of the research plan."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in foundation model development: efficient and principled data curation for multimodal models. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions. From a technical perspective, the hierarchical influence estimation framework could significantly advance data-centric AI development. From a practical standpoint, achieving 60% data reduction while maintaining performance would substantially lower computational costs and carbon footprints for FM training. The fairness improvements through targeted cluster up-weighting could address important ethical concerns in AI development. The proposal explicitly connects to multiple DATA-FM workshop themes and offers contributions that could influence both academic research and industry practices. The open-source toolkit mentioned in the expected outcomes could enable broader adoption of influence-driven curation approaches."
