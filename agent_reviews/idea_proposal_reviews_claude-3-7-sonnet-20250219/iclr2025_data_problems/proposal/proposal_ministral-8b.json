    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Data Collection and Curation for Foundation Models' topic from the workshop call, focusing on practical strategies for curating data tailored to FM training. The proposal maintains fidelity to the original research idea, elaborating on the two-stage pipeline for hierarchical influence-driven curation through cross-modal embeddings and influence score computation. It builds upon the literature review by incorporating concepts from DataInf for efficient influence estimation and addressing challenges identified in HEMM regarding multimodal model evaluation. The proposal also considers fairness aspects mentioned in the Chameleon paper and builds on multimodal foundation concepts from FLAVA. The only minor limitation is that while it addresses data curation and bias mitigation, it could more explicitly connect to some other workshop topics like data attribution or copyright protection."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and motivation. The methodology section is particularly strong, with a clear two-stage pipeline that includes detailed mathematical formulations for cross-modal embedding, clustering, influence score computation, and pruning/up-weighting. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined with specific formulas. The expected outcomes and impact sections provide a comprehensive view of the research's potential contributions. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific clustering algorithm to be used is not specified, (2) the exact implementation details of the low-rank Hessian approximation could be more detailed, and (3) the proposal could more explicitly describe how the influence scores will be calculated at scale for very large datasets."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The hierarchical approach to influence estimation through clustering is innovative and addresses a significant gap in current data curation methods for multimodal foundation models. The two-stage pipeline that first clusters data into semantically coherent groups before computing influence scores is a fresh perspective that could significantly improve computational efficiency. However, the core techniques used (influence functions, clustering, cross-modal embeddings) are established methods in the literature. The proposal builds upon existing work like DataInf for influence estimation rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. While the combination and application to multimodal foundation models is novel, the individual components are adaptations of existing approaches. The proposal would benefit from more explicitly highlighting what specific technical innovations it contributes beyond the integration of existing methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established machine learning techniques, with appropriate mathematical formulations for each step of the pipeline. The influence estimation approach builds on solid theoretical work in the field, and the evaluation metrics are well-defined and appropriate for measuring the method's effectiveness. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and covers multiple dimensions of performance (accuracy, bias, efficiency). The proposal also acknowledges the computational challenges of influence estimation and addresses them through clustering and amortization. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) more detailed justification for why cluster-level influence is a good proxy for individual data point influence, (2) analysis of potential error propagation from the clustering stage to the influence estimation stage, and (3) more discussion of the theoretical guarantees or limitations of the approach. Overall, the technical approach is sound with only minor gaps in the theoretical justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with existing technology and methods, though it will require significant computational resources and careful implementation. The two-stage pipeline breaks down a complex problem into manageable components, and the use of pre-trained models for cross-modal embedding is practical. The clustering approach to amortize influence computation addresses the computational challenges of applying influence functions at scale. However, several feasibility concerns exist: (1) computing influence functions even at the cluster level may still be computationally intensive for very large models, (2) the quality of the clusters will significantly impact the effectiveness of the method, and potential clustering errors are not addressed, (3) the proposal doesn't specify the computational resources required or provide estimates of processing time for large datasets, and (4) the evaluation on multiple vision-language benchmarks will require substantial resources. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present implementation hurdles that will need to be carefully managed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in foundation model development: effective data curation for multimodal models. If successful, this research could significantly impact how training data is selected and balanced for large-scale models, potentially reducing computational costs, improving model performance, and enhancing fairness. The approach offers a principled alternative to heuristic-based data filtering methods currently in use. The significance is particularly high given the growing importance of multimodal foundation models and the increasing concerns about data quality, bias, and efficiency. The proposal's impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in industry, where reducing training costs while maintaining or improving performance is highly valuable. The bias mitigation aspect also addresses important societal concerns about AI fairness. While the proposal may not completely revolutionize foundation model training, it offers a substantial improvement to a critical component of the pipeline that could influence how future models are developed."
