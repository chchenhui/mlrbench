        "justification": "The proposed fairness-aware auditing framework for data curation pipelines aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on data problems in foundation models. It directly addresses the 'Data and Society' topic area by focusing on fairness implications of data curation decisions. It also connects to 'Data Collection and Curation for Foundation Models' by examining how specific curation operations affect model behavior across demographic groups. The proposal recognizes that data curation decisions impact foundation model behavior and aims to provide transparency in understanding these effects - a core concern highlighted in the workshop description. The only minor limitation in alignment is that it doesn't explicitly address some other workshop topics like data attribution or copyright protection."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (opacity in how data curation decisions affect fairness), proposes a specific solution (a modular auditing framework), and outlines the expected functionality and outcomes. The proposal specifies concrete examples of inputs (curation operations like toxicity filtering thresholds) and outputs (quantitative metrics on differential impacts). However, it could benefit from slightly more detail on the specific fairness metrics that would be used, the exact methodology for measuring differential impacts, and how the framework would handle the scale challenges inherent to foundation models. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by focusing specifically on the fairness implications of data curation pipelines for foundation models - an area that has received less attention than model architecture or training algorithm fairness. The modular approach to auditing individual stages of the curation pipeline is innovative and allows for granular analysis. However, fairness auditing tools and frameworks exist in other ML contexts, and the proposal adapts these concepts to the specific domain of FM data curation rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm. The combination of fairness evaluation with data curation decisions is valuable but builds upon existing work in algorithmic fairness and responsible AI development."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed framework is largely feasible with existing technologies and methodologies. Creating metrics to evaluate representation differences across demographic groups and implementing proxies for downstream task performance are established practices in fairness research. The modular design is practical and allows for incremental development. However, there are significant challenges that affect feasibility: (1) obtaining sufficient demographic information about data in large-scale FM training sets is often difficult; (2) defining appropriate fairness metrics across diverse tasks and domains is complex; (3) establishing causal links between specific curation decisions and fairness outcomes requires careful experimental design; and (4) scaling the analysis to the massive datasets used in FM training presents computational challenges. These hurdles are surmountable but require substantial effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in foundation model development. As FMs become increasingly central to AI applications, understanding how data curation decisions affect fairness across demographic groups is essential for building more equitable systems. The proposed framework would provide valuable transparency and enable more informed decision-making in the data preparation pipeline - an often overlooked but highly influential stage in model development. The potential impact extends beyond academic research to practical applications in industry, where data curation decisions are made regularly but often without systematic fairness evaluation. By focusing on the upstream data processes rather than just model outputs, this work could help prevent biases from being encoded in the first place, which is more effective than trying to mitigate them afterward."
