        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on integrating eye gaze with machine learning. It directly addresses the topic of 'Unsupervised ML using eye gaze information for feature importance/selection' which is explicitly listed in the workshop topics. The proposal leverages eye gaze as a physiological signal to reveal human attentional patterns and uses this to inform feature relevance, which is central to the workshop's goal of 'bridging human cognition and AI.' The idea also touches on interpretability aspects mentioned in the workshop description. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some of the other potential topics like ethics or specific applications in domains like radiology or AR/VR, though these could be natural extensions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with good clarity. It clearly articulates the motivation (using eye gaze to identify relevant features without labels), the main approach (modeling relationships between gaze statistics and feature relevance), and expected outcomes (attention-driven feature ranking and improved downstream performance). The technical approach mentions specific methods like contrastive learning and generative models. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific algorithms for aggregating gaze data across observers, how conflicts in attention patterns would be resolved, and more concrete details about the implementation of the feature representation learning process. The proposal is well-structured but leaves some implementation details open."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates strong novelty in several ways. While eye tracking has been used in various contexts, using gaze data specifically for unsupervised feature relevance discovery represents an innovative approach. The proposal bridges human perception (through eye gaze) with machine learning in a way that doesn't require explicit task labels, which is relatively unexplored. The combination of passive observation data with representation learning techniques to extract feature importance is creative. The approach isn't entirely without precedent - eye tracking has been used for attention modeling and some work exists on gaze-informed machine learning - but the specific application to unsupervised feature relevance discovery and the proposed methodology appear to offer a fresh perspective that could advance both gaze research and unsupervised learning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several challenges. Collecting high-quality eye-tracking data from multiple observers can be resource-intensive and requires specialized equipment. Ensuring consistency across different observers and controlling for individual differences in attention patterns presents methodological challenges. The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle the variability in gaze patterns across individuals or how to establish ground truth for feature relevance without labels. Additionally, mapping low-level gaze features to high-level feature importance is non-trivial and may require sophisticated modeling approaches. While the technical components (contrastive learning, generative models) exist, integrating them with eye-tracking data in the proposed manner would require significant development. The idea is implementable but would require substantial resources, careful experimental design, and methodological innovations to overcome these challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant problem in machine learning: identifying relevant features without labeled data. If successful, it could have substantial impact across multiple domains. The approach could provide a more human-aligned method for feature selection compared to purely statistical approaches, potentially improving model interpretability and alignment with human perception. It could be particularly valuable in domains where expert attention is meaningful but labeled data is scarce, such as medical imaging, scientific visualization, or complex decision-making scenarios. The work could also contribute to our understanding of human attention mechanisms and their relationship to feature importance. The significance extends beyond the specific method to broader questions about incorporating human cognitive signals into machine learning pipelines. The main limitation to its significance is the potential domain-specificity of the approach and questions about generalizability across different types of data and tasks."
