    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on integrating eye gaze with machine learning, specifically in the medical imaging domain. The GazeCL framework builds upon the core idea of using radiologists' gaze patterns for self-supervised feature prioritization without manual annotations. The proposal cites and extends concepts from the literature review, including McGIP, FocusContrast, and GazeGNN, while addressing the key challenges identified. The methodology section clearly outlines how gaze data will be incorporated into a contrastive learning framework, which is consistent with the workshop's interest in 'unsupervised ML using eye gaze information for feature importance/selection' and 'annotation and ML supervision with eye-gaze.'"

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and impact. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formulations. The gaze-guided contrastive learning mechanism is explained in detail, including the positive/negative sampling strategy and loss function. The experimental design outlines specific evaluation metrics and baselines. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact procedure for integrating the gaze-guided attention layer with the ViT architecture could be more detailed, (2) the threshold parameter γ for distinguishing gazed vs. non-gazed regions needs more justification, and (3) the proposal could more explicitly address how it will handle the variability in gaze patterns mentioned in the literature review challenges."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing GazeCL, which extends existing gaze-guided and contrastive learning approaches in several ways. The multi-scale approach to gaze-guided contrastive learning and the specific formulation of the loss function that contrasts gazed vs. non-gazed regions represent innovative contributions. The integration of gaze data with Vision Transformers specifically for medical imaging is also relatively unexplored. However, the core concept builds significantly upon existing work cited in the literature review, particularly McGIP and FocusContrast, which already establish the foundation of using gaze data for contrastive learning in medical imaging. While the proposal offers meaningful extensions and refinements to these approaches, it doesn't represent a fundamentally new paradigm but rather an evolution of existing techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for gaze heatmap generation and the contrastive loss function are well-defined and appropriate for the task. The experimental design includes comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUC-ROC, Dice score, NSS, SIM) and appropriate baselines from the literature. The methodology logically connects gaze data to feature prioritization through the attention mechanism. The proposal also acknowledges limitations in gaze-preserving augmentations, citing recent literature (arXiv:2501.02451). However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address how it will handle inter-radiologist variability in gaze patterns, (2) the justification for choosing ViT over other architectures could be more thorough, and (3) while the loss function is well-formulated, additional analysis of its theoretical properties or potential limitations would enhance rigor."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. It leverages publicly available datasets (CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR) and established deep learning frameworks. The eye-tracking technology required is mature and accessible. The experimental design is realistic and includes appropriate evaluation metrics. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) as noted in the literature review challenges, collecting comprehensive eye-tracking data from radiologists is resource-intensive, and the proposal doesn't fully address how it will overcome the limited availability of such data; (2) the computational requirements for training Vision Transformers with the proposed gaze-guided attention mechanism could be substantial; (3) the proposal mentions comparing against several baselines, which will require significant implementation effort; and (4) the integration of gaze data with the ViT architecture may require non-trivial engineering work. These challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, but they do present moderate hurdles to implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in medical AI: the need for models that can learn from limited labeled data while focusing on clinically relevant features. The potential impact is substantial across several dimensions: (1) reducing annotation burden in medical imaging, which is a critical bottleneck; (2) improving model interpretability by aligning AI attention with expert focus; (3) enhancing diagnostic accuracy, particularly in low-resource settings; and (4) establishing a framework that could be extended to other domains beyond radiology. The expected outcomes are quantified (≥5% higher AUC-ROC, ≥0.7 NSS correlation, 30-50% reduction in labeled data requirements), making the significance measurable. The proposal also addresses broader impacts on clinical workflow integration and democratizing access to AI diagnostics. While the immediate impact is focused on medical imaging, the approach could influence how gaze data is used in machine learning more broadly, aligning with the workshop's goal of bridging human cognition and AI."
