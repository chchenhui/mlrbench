        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the MINT workshop's focus on foundation model interventions and controllability by proposing surgical circuit interventions for targeted harm reduction. The methodology incorporates causal tracing techniques and low-rank adaptations as mentioned in the literature review (e.g., FLORAIN, LoRA, PEFTDebias). The proposal comprehensively addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly the identification of causal neural circuits and development of targeted interventions. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets and evaluation metrics that align with the task's goals of mitigating harmful content while preserving model capabilities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research design is logically organized into three phases (causal circuit identification, intervention design, validation), making the workflow easy to follow. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-presented, particularly the equations for causal effect measurement and the two intervention strategies. The experimental design clearly outlines baselines, evaluation metrics, and statistical analysis approaches. However, there are minor areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as more specific details on how the causal circuits will be validated and how the preservation regularizer will be balanced against the harm reduction objective during training."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining causal interpretability techniques with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in a novel way. The concept of 'circuit breakers' that specifically target harmful pathways represents a fresh approach to harm reduction. While individual components like causal tracing and low-rank adaptations exist in the literature (as cited), their integration for surgical interventions on harmful circuits is innovative. The proposal extends beyond existing work by focusing on causal mechanisms rather than just correlational patterns. However, it builds significantly on existing methods like FLORAIN, LoRA, and activation steering rather than introducing entirely new paradigms, which somewhat limits its groundbreaking nature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for causal circuit identification and intervention design are well-defined and technically sound. The research methodology follows established scientific principles, with appropriate controls, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The experimental design includes statistical validation (paired t-tests) to ensure significance of results. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional theoretical justification, such as the choice of significance threshold τ for identifying causal circuits and more detailed explanation of how the preservation regularizer will be weighted against the harm reduction objective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The use of parameter-efficient methods (low-rank adaptations) makes the approach computationally tractable compared to full fine-tuning. The datasets and evaluation metrics are well-established and accessible. The research builds on existing techniques that have been demonstrated to work in related contexts. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) reliably identifying causal circuits for complex harmful behaviors may be more difficult than presented, (2) balancing harm reduction against preservation of general capabilities will require careful tuning, and (3) the expected 50% reduction in toxicity/bias with <5% degradation in general capabilities is ambitious and may require multiple iterations to achieve."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety: mitigating harmful outputs from foundation models without compromising their general capabilities. The significance is high because current approaches like full fine-tuning or RLHF are computationally expensive and often degrade model performance. The expected outcomes—a causal circuit atlas, intervention framework, and empirical results—would provide valuable resources to the research community and industry practitioners. The work aligns perfectly with the MINT workshop's goals of improving foundation model controllability and understanding. The potential impact extends beyond academic research to practical applications in making AI systems safer for deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and education. However, the significance would be even higher if the proposal included more discussion of how the approach might generalize to other types of harmful behaviors beyond toxicity and bias."
