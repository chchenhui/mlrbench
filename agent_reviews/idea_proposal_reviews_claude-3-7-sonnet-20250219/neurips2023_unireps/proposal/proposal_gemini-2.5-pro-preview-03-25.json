        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on unifying representations in neural models, particularly for model merging and multimodal applications. The proposal builds upon the core idea of using optimal transport for cross-modal alignment, elaborating it into a comprehensive framework with clear methodology. It incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works like AlignMamba and DecAlign that use OT for alignment, while addressing the identified key challenges such as modality heterogeneity and identifiability. The proposal maintains consistency throughout, from the theoretical foundations to the practical implementation details and evaluation protocols."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined, and the technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-specified baselines, evaluation protocols, and metrics. The only minor issues are that some sections could benefit from more concise explanations, and the mathematical notation, while correct, might be challenging for non-specialists to follow. Additionally, some implementation details of the OT-based alignment could be further clarified, particularly regarding the computational optimizations for large-scale applications."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by developing a comprehensive framework for cross-modal alignment using optimal transport specifically designed for model merging. While individual components like OT for alignment or cross-attention for fusion have been explored in prior work (as evidenced in the literature review), the integration of these techniques into a cohesive framework with a focus on identifiability and invertibility analysis represents a fresh perspective. The proposal extends beyond existing approaches by emphasizing the creation of a shared latent space that facilitates seamless merging without full retraining, which differentiates it from works like AlignMamba that focus more on multimodal fusion within a single architecture. However, it doesn't introduce fundamentally new algorithmic innovations, instead combining and adapting existing techniques in a thoughtful way."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulation of the OT-based alignment is well-grounded in established theory, with clear connections to Wasserstein distances and entropy regularization. The methodology is comprehensive, covering all aspects from data collection to evaluation. The experimental design is particularly robust, with appropriate baselines, ablation studies, and evaluation metrics. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and includes strategies to address them, such as computational efficiency concerns with Sinkhorn iterations. The identifiability analysis is well-conceived, proposing multiple approaches (reconstruction loss, Jacobian analysis, mutual information) to investigate this important aspect. One minor weakness is that some theoretical guarantees regarding the convergence properties of the alignment process could be more thoroughly addressed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with existing technology and methods. The use of pre-trained models as starting points reduces computational requirements, and the alignment and fusion stages are designed to be parameter-efficient. The datasets mentioned (MS-COCO, Conceptual Captions) are publicly available, and the evaluation benchmarks are standard in the field. However, there are some implementation challenges that might require considerable effort: (1) The computational complexity of OT methods for large datasets could be problematic, though the proposal acknowledges this and suggests using Sinkhorn iterations; (2) The identifiability analysis, particularly the Jacobian analysis and mutual information estimation, may be difficult to implement robustly; (3) The comparison with some baselines like AlignMamba might require significant adaptation work. Overall, while ambitious, the proposal is realistically implementable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in multimodal AI with potentially far-reaching implications. Successfully aligning and merging pre-trained unimodal models would significantly reduce computational costs and democratize access to powerful multimodal capabilities, aligning with broader goals of sustainable AI development. The framework could enable more efficient knowledge transfer between modalities and improve performance on complex multimodal tasks. The theoretical contributions regarding identifiability and the trade-offs between alignment and information preservation would advance understanding of representation learning. The practical applications span numerous domains including robotics, embodied AI, and human-computer interaction. While not completely transformative of the field, the proposal offers meaningful contributions that could substantially impact both theoretical understanding and practical applications of multimodal representation learning."
