    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of unifying representations across neural models, specifically focusing on cross-modal alignment for model merging. The proposal incorporates optimal transport as the primary mechanism for alignment, as specified in the research idea, and builds upon the literature review by addressing key challenges like modality heterogeneity and semantic consistency. The methodology section thoroughly details the OT formulation, alignment process, and post-alignment fusion, which aligns perfectly with the proposed approach. The proposal also addresses identifiability concerns mentioned in both the task description and literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the task description emphasizes both biological and artificial neural systems, the proposal primarily focuses on artificial systems."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is presented with appropriate mathematical formulations that enhance understanding. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined, providing a clear roadmap for implementation and validation. The use of subsections and bullet points improves readability. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the OT-based alignment and the identifiability constraints could be more explicitly connected, (2) The exact procedure for model fusion after alignment could be elaborated further, and (3) Some technical details about the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm implementation might be challenging for readers unfamiliar with optimal transport theory."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining optimal transport with identifiability constraints for cross-modal representation alignment. While optimal transport has been used for alignment in previous work (as evidenced in the literature review), the proposal introduces several novel aspects: (1) The specific focus on invertibility and identifiability of mappings to preserve model functionality, (2) The integration of bijectivity constraints during OT optimization, and (3) The adaptive cross-attention fusion mechanism for merged models. However, the core concept of using OT for cross-modal alignment is not entirely new, as similar approaches appear in the literature review (e.g., papers 5, 6, and 8). The proposal builds incrementally on existing methods rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm, which limits its novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical underpinnings. The optimal transport formulation is mathematically rigorous, with clear objective functions and constraints. The Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm is an established method for approximating OT solutions, and the proposal correctly incorporates entropy regularization. The identifiability analysis includes appropriate constraints on the transport plan to ensure invertibility. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and evaluation metrics that align with standard practices in the field. However, there are a few areas that could be strengthened: (1) The theoretical guarantees for semantic consistency could be more thoroughly developed, (2) The impact of the entropy regularization parameter Î» on alignment quality is not fully explored, and (3) The proposal could benefit from a more detailed error analysis to anticipate potential failure modes."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation requirements. The methodology leverages existing pre-trained models and established datasets, which reduces implementation barriers. The Sinkhorn algorithm for OT is computationally tractable with appropriate regularization, and the cross-attention fusion mechanism builds on well-understood transformer architectures. The data requirements are reasonable, with the proposal acknowledging potential data scarcity and suggesting synthetic data generation as a mitigation strategy. However, several challenges affect feasibility: (1) Optimal transport can be computationally expensive for high-dimensional representations, potentially limiting scalability, (2) The bijectivity constraints might be difficult to enforce in practice, especially for representations of different dimensionalities, and (3) The evaluation on complex tasks like VQA requires significant computational resources. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present notable implementation hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem with broad implications for multimodal AI systems. Successfully aligning cross-modal representations would enable more efficient model reuse, reduce computational costs for training multimodal systems, and potentially improve performance on tasks requiring cross-modal reasoning. The practical applications span multiple domains, including robotics, assistive technologies, and embodied AI. The theoretical contributions to understanding representation invariances and the role of optimal transport in model interoperability are valuable to the research community. The proposal also aligns with current trends toward more modular, reusable AI systems. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on specific modality pairs (primarily vision-language) and the dependence on paired data, which may not generalize to all cross-modal scenarios. Additionally, while the proposal aims for a 40% reduction in training costs, the actual impact on real-world applications would depend on the quality of the aligned representations."
