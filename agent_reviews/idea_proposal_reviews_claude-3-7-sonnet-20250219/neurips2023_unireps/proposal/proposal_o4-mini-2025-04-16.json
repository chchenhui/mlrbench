        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of unifying representations across neural models, specifically focusing on cross-modal alignment for model merging. The methodology employs optimal transport (OT) for alignment as outlined in the research idea, and builds upon the literature by addressing gaps in existing OT-based methods. The proposal acknowledges and cites relevant works from the literature review (AlignMamba, CMOT, DecAlign) and addresses the key challenges identified, particularly modality heterogeneity, semantic consistency, and invertibility. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets and metrics that align with the task's objectives of measuring representation similarity and evaluating practical applications in model merging."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical formulations are precise and well-defined, particularly in the mathematical descriptions of the OT problem, invertible mapping, and cross-attention fusion. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the experimental design is comprehensive. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the invertible mapping T_θ and the OT coupling γ* could be more explicitly explained, (2) the proposition on identifiability could include more details on the assumptions and implications, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., CKA score) are mentioned without definition. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible but has minor areas for improvement."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The integration of entropic-regularized OT for cross-modal alignment with invertible neural networks (RealNVP/Glow) to ensure bijective mappings is a fresh approach. The theoretical analysis of identifiability in the context of OT-based alignment adds a novel perspective. However, the core components (OT for alignment, invertible networks, cross-attention fusion) are individually well-established in the literature. The gap analysis correctly identifies that existing methods lack the combination of precise pair-wise OT couplings, provably invertible maps, and lightweight fusion without retraining, but the individual techniques themselves are not groundbreaking. The proposal offers an innovative synthesis rather than fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical frameworks."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulation of the OT problem, the invertible mapping, and the cross-attention mechanism are all technically sound. The inclusion of a proposition on identifiability with a proof sketch based on Brenier's theorem shows deep theoretical understanding. The training methodology with a composite loss function that balances alignment, task performance, and reconstruction is well-justified. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, metrics, and implementation details. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) the proof sketch for the identifiability proposition is quite brief and could benefit from more detailed analysis, (2) the impact of the entropic regularization parameter ε on the theoretical guarantees is not fully explored, and (3) the computational complexity of the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm for large batches could be addressed more explicitly."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with some implementation challenges. The OT computation using Sinkhorn-Knopp is well-established and implementable, as are invertible neural networks like RealNVP/Glow. The cross-attention fusion mechanism is standard in multimodal systems. The experimental setup uses existing datasets and metrics, with reasonable hyperparameters and training regimes. However, there are feasibility concerns: (1) computing OT couplings for large batches (256 pairs) may be computationally intensive, potentially requiring GPU optimization or approximation techniques, (2) training invertible networks can be numerically unstable, requiring careful initialization and normalization, and (3) the proposal assumes access to paired data across modalities, which may be limited for some domains. While these challenges are manageable, they represent non-trivial implementation hurdles that could affect the practical execution of the project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem with significant potential impact. Successfully aligning representations across modalities would enable more efficient model reuse, reduce computational costs for multimodal systems, and advance our theoretical understanding of representation learning. The expected outcomes are substantial: 40-60% reduction in Wasserstein cost, performance within 1-2% of jointly trained models, and 70-80% reduction in GPU compute. These would represent meaningful advances in the field. The broader impacts on compute-efficient AI, modular robotics, theoretical insights, sustainability, and ethical considerations are well-articulated and compelling. The proposal connects theoretical advances (identifiability in neural maps) with practical applications (efficient multimodal fusion), enhancing its significance. While not transformative of the entire field, the work could significantly influence how researchers approach multimodal learning and model merging, making it a highly significant contribution."
