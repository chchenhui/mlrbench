    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of unifying representations across neural models, specifically focusing on cross-modality alignment using optimal transport. The methodology thoroughly implements the proposed idea of using OT for representation alignment and seamless model merging. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, including optimal transport alignment techniques (referencing AlignMamba and DecAlign), cross-modal representation challenges, and invertibility concerns. The experimental design appropriately includes baselines mentioned in the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions computational complexity as a key challenge, the proposal addresses this somewhat briefly with the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm but could have elaborated more on scalability solutions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical formulations are precise and well-defined, particularly in the Optimal Transport Alignment section where mathematical notation is used appropriately. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically connected to the methodology. The experimental design clearly outlines baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for ensuring invertibility could be more thoroughly explained, (2) the relationship between the OT alignment and the cross-attention fusion architecture could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'identifiability') are used without sufficient definition for non-expert readers."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The key innovation lies in using optimal transport for cross-modal alignment while ensuring invertibility through orthogonal parameterization, which preserves individual model functionality. The adaptive cross-attention fusion mechanism without retraining is also a fresh approach. However, the core techniques (OT alignment, Sinkhorn algorithm, cross-attention) are established methods in the literature. The proposal builds upon existing work like AlignMamba and DecAlign (mentioned in the literature review) rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. While the combination and application are innovative, particularly the focus on invertible mappings and seamless merging without retraining, the individual components are derived from prior work. The proposal would benefit from more clearly articulating its specific technical advances beyond existing OT-based alignment methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical underpinnings. The optimal transport formulation is mathematically rigorous, with clear objective functions, constraints, and solution methods (Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm). The invertible mapping approach using orthogonal parameterization is theoretically sound for preserving bijective relationships. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics that directly measure the claims made in the proposal. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the effects of key components. However, there are some areas that could be strengthened: (1) the theoretical analysis of when OT alignment preserves semantic invariances could be more detailed, (2) the proposal mentions but doesn't fully develop the connection to neuroscience findings about universal representation patterns, and (3) while the approach to ensure invertibility is mentioned, the mathematical details of how the orthogonal parameterization is optimized during training are somewhat underspecified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The OT alignment approach using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm is implementable and has been shown to work in similar contexts. The datasets mentioned (LAION-400M, ScienceQA, VQA, ImageNet) are publicly available. The computational requirements, while significant, are within the range of typical deep learning research projects. The experimental design is practical and includes appropriate metrics and baselines. However, there are feasibility concerns: (1) scaling OT to very large datasets remains challenging despite entropic regularization, (2) ensuring that the invertible transformations truly preserve model functionality across diverse tasks may be more difficult than anticipated, (3) the proposal aims for merged models to achieve ≥95% of joint fine-tuning performance, which is an ambitious target that may be difficult to achieve in practice, and (4) the pseudo-labeling approach for unpaired data is mentioned but not fully developed methodologically."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem with significant potential impact. Successfully aligning representations across modalities without retraining would enable more efficient knowledge transfer, reduce computational costs, and democratize access to multimodal AI systems. The practical applications in robotics, embodied AI, and low-resource settings are compelling and well-justified. The theoretical contributions regarding conditions for preserving semantic invariances could advance understanding of representation learning more broadly. The proposal explicitly quantifies expected impacts (e.g., 50% reduction in training compute costs), making the significance concrete and measurable. The connection to both AI and neuroscience research enhances interdisciplinary relevance. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on specific modalities (vision and language) rather than a more general framework applicable to any arbitrary modalities, and the practical impact depends on achieving the ambitious performance targets stated in the expected outcomes."
