    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, which focuses on unifying representations in neural models. The proposed function-space model merging via optimal transport directly addresses the core theme of aligning representations between different neural networks. It specifically targets the 'model merging' topic listed in the task description and addresses the 'What for' section by providing a practical application for knowledge transfer between models. The idea also connects to representational alignment, similarity measures in neural networks, and linear mode connectivity - all explicitly mentioned as preferred topics. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address the biological/neuroscience angle mentioned in the task description, focusing primarily on artificial neural networks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (merging independently trained neural networks), identifies the limitation of current approaches (simple parameter averaging fails due to functional differences), and proposes a specific solution (using Optimal Transport to align intermediate representations before merging). The methodology is well-defined, explaining how the OT plan would be computed and applied to transform parameters before averaging. The expected outcome is also clearly stated. The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details - for example, exactly which activation distributions would be used for the OT alignment (e.g., from which datasets), and how the approach would handle layers of different sizes or architectures. These implementation details would need further elaboration in a full proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining optimal transport theory with neural network merging in a principled way. While both model merging and optimal transport are established areas, their combination for functional alignment before parameter averaging represents a fresh approach. The focus on function-space alignment rather than direct parameter-space manipulation is an innovative perspective. However, there are existing works on permutation-based neuron alignment for model merging (e.g., Weight Averaging in Parameter Space), and optimal transport has been used in other neural network contexts before. The idea builds upon these existing concepts rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, which is why it scores well but not at the highest level of novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is feasible with current technology and methods. Optimal transport algorithms are well-established, and the computational infrastructure for working with neural network activations is readily available. The layer-wise approach makes the problem tractable compared to trying to align entire networks at once. However, there are implementation challenges that moderate the feasibility score: (1) computing optimal transport can be computationally expensive for large layers, (2) the approach might require significant amounts of data to estimate activation distributions accurately, (3) handling non-linearities and complex architectures like transformers or CNNs might require additional considerations, and (4) the effectiveness might vary across different types of tasks and architectures. These challenges are surmountable but would require careful engineering and possibly some theoretical extensions."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The significance of this research idea is high. Effective model merging has important implications for knowledge distillation, ensemble methods, federated learning, and efficient model reuse - all increasingly important in the era of large, expensive-to-train models. If successful, this approach could enable more effective combination of independently trained models, potentially leading to performance improvements without the need for retraining from scratch. The principled nature of using functional similarity via optimal transport could advance our theoretical understanding of neural network representations and their alignment. The impact extends beyond just a technical improvement, potentially enabling new workflows in collaborative AI development where models trained by different teams could be more effectively combined. The approach addresses a meaningful problem in representation learning with broad applications."
