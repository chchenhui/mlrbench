        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on the intersection of AI and HCI. It directly addresses reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which is explicitly listed as a topic of interest. The proposal also incorporates explainable AI, interpretable machine learning methods, and human-in-the-loop systems - all specifically mentioned in the workshop topics. The idea of using natural language explanations to refine reward functions addresses the challenge of creating personalizable and correctable machine learning models, another listed topic. The application domains mentioned (healthcare, education, human-AI collaboration) are relevant to the workshop's scope of practical AI tools for human interaction."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The problem statement clearly identifies the limitation of scalar rewards in RLHF. The proposed solution - a dual-model architecture combining policy networks with language models that map explanations to reward modifiers - is well articulated. The bidirectional feedback loop concept is explained concisely. However, some technical details could be more specific, such as how exactly the language model will translate explanations into semantic reward modifiers, and what architectural innovations might be needed to implement this effectively. The expected outcomes and application domains are clearly stated, but the evaluation methodology could be more explicitly defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty by extending traditional RLHF beyond scalar rewards to incorporate natural language explanations. While RLHF itself is not new, the integration of explanatory feedback to dynamically refine reward functions represents a fresh approach. The bidirectional loop where explanations shape policies and policies generate explanations is particularly innovative. The concept bridges multiple research areas (reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and explainable AI) in a way that hasn't been extensively explored. However, there are existing works on incorporating language feedback in RL and on generating explanations for AI decisions, though perhaps not combined in this specific manner with the bidirectional loop for RLHF."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears feasible with current technology, though it presents several implementation challenges. Large language models have demonstrated capabilities in understanding natural language explanations, and reinforcement learning frameworks are well-established. However, effectively mapping explanations to semantic reward modifiers will require careful design and likely significant computational resources. The collection of high-quality human feedback with explanations could be resource-intensive and potentially introduce biases. The dual-model architecture adds complexity that might increase training difficulty. While challenging, these issues don't appear insurmountable given recent advances in both language models and reinforcement learning. The proposal would benefit from more specific details on implementation strategies and potential technical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental limitation in current RLHF approaches and has potentially far-reaching implications. By enabling more nuanced human feedback through explanations, it could significantly improve AI alignment with human intent - a critical challenge in AI safety. The expected reduction in sample complexity would make RLHF more practical and accessible. The enhanced transparency through explanations directly addresses trust issues that currently limit AI adoption in sensitive domains. The applications in healthcare, education, and human-AI collaboration are areas where improved alignment and transparency could have substantial societal impact. This work could establish a new paradigm for human-AI interaction that better captures the richness of human intent and reasoning, potentially influencing how future AI systems are designed and trained."
