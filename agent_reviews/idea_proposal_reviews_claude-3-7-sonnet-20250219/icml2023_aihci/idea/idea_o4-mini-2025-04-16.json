    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The ActiveHCI idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on the intersection of AI and HCI. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the task description, including UI generation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), active learning, human-in-the-loop systems, and personalizable/correctable machine learning models. The proposal's core mechanism of iterative refinement based on designer feedback perfectly embodies the workshop's interest in novel human interactions with models. The only minor limitation preventing a perfect score is that it doesn't explicitly address ethics and fairness considerations mentioned in the workshop topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented in a well-structured and comprehensible manner. The five-step process (initialization, feedback loop, reward modeling, active querying, and iterative refinement) provides a clear framework for understanding how the system would function. The technical components are well-articulated, mentioning specific approaches like layout-diffusion networks, Bayesian optimization, and policy gradients. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as how the reward network specifically translates different types of feedback (binary flags, drag-and-drop adjustments, natural language comments) into a coherent reward signal, and how the active learning component balances exploration versus exploitation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining several existing techniques (generative UI models, active learning, and RLHF) in a novel way specifically for UI design. The component-level feedback mechanism and the integration of active querying to maximize learning efficiency represent innovative approaches to UI generation. However, each of the individual components (generative models for UI, RLHF, active learning) has been explored in prior work, albeit not necessarily in this specific combination. The proposal builds upon existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or paradigms, which limits its novelty score somewhat."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with current technology. Generative models for UI design exist, as do implementations of RLHF and active learning frameworks. The component-based feedback mechanism seems implementable, especially with modern UI toolkits. However, there are some practical challenges that would need to be addressed: (1) collecting sufficient human feedback to effectively train the reward model, (2) ensuring the active learning component selects truly informative examples rather than just difficult edge cases, (3) balancing the computational requirements of real-time generation with the need for interactive speeds in a design workflow, and (4) developing an intuitive interface for designers to provide the various forms of feedback mentioned."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant problem in AI-driven UI generation: the lack of personalization and difficulty in making corrections. By incorporating human feedback directly into the generation process, it could substantially improve the practical utility of AI for UI design. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to real-world design workflows, potentially saving considerable time and resources while improving end-user experience. The approach could also generalize to other design domains beyond UIs. The significance is enhanced by the proposal to release a publicly available toolkit, which would enable broader adoption and extension of the research. However, the impact might be somewhat limited to professional designers rather than addressing broader societal challenges."
