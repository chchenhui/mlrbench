    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of exploring how generative model priors can enable sample efficiency and effective exploration, particularly in sparse reward settings. The proposed Diffusion-Guided Exploration (DGE) framework faithfully implements the core idea of using pre-trained diffusion models to generate novelty-seeking exploratory behaviors. The proposal incorporates relevant literature from the review, citing works like Huang et al. (2023), Janner (2023), Black et al. (2023), and Zhao & Grover (2023), while building upon the identified challenges of sample efficiency and exploration in sparse reward environments. The methodology is comprehensive and logically follows from the research idea, with clear connections to the literature on diffusion models and reinforcement learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The overall framework is logically presented in two distinct phases: diffusion model pre-training and RL training with diffusion-guided intrinsic rewards. The technical details are well-explained, including the diffusion model architecture, training objective, and the integration with RL algorithms. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate environments, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for selecting target states from generated trajectories could be more precisely defined, (2) the criteria for when to generate new goals during training could be more specific, and (3) some mathematical notations could be better explained for broader accessibility."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to exploration in reinforcement learning by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models to guide the exploration process. While both diffusion models and intrinsic motivation techniques have been studied separately, their integration in the proposed manner—using diffusion models to generate plausible future states as exploration targets—represents a fresh perspective. The proposal explicitly differentiates its approach from existing works that use diffusion for reward learning (Huang et al., 2023), policy representation (Janner, 2023), or direct optimization (Black et al., 2023). The idea of using generative models to provide structured exploration targets rather than just as world models or policy networks is innovative. However, some conceptual elements, such as using generative models for goal-directed exploration and intrinsic rewards based on state similarity, do build upon existing ideas in the field, which slightly tempers the novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-grounded in established theoretical foundations from both diffusion models and reinforcement learning. The methodology is rigorous, with clear mathematical formulations for the diffusion model training and the intrinsic reward calculation. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are some potential theoretical concerns: (1) The assumption that a diffusion model pre-trained on diverse trajectories will generate useful exploratory targets may not always hold, especially if the pre-training data distribution differs significantly from the target task. (2) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle the potential mismatch between generated states and physically achievable states in the environment. (3) The balance between exploration (following generated goals) and exploitation (maximizing extrinsic rewards) could be more thoroughly analyzed. These concerns don't invalidate the approach but suggest areas where additional theoretical analysis would strengthen the proposal."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined implementation steps. The two-phase framework is practical, and the integration with standard RL algorithms like SAC and PPO is straightforward. The experimental design uses established benchmarks and metrics. However, several implementation challenges may affect feasibility: (1) Training diffusion models on trajectory data can be computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional state spaces or image-based observations. (2) The quality and diversity of pre-training data will significantly impact performance, and collecting sufficient relevant data might be challenging for some domains. (3) The proposal requires careful tuning of several hyperparameters (e.g., intrinsic reward scaling, goal selection strategy, frequency of goal generation), which could be time-consuming. (4) For complex environments, the generated states might not be physically reachable, potentially leading to wasted exploration effort. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the approach infeasible, but rather indicate areas requiring careful implementation and potential adaptations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning—efficient exploration in sparse reward settings—which has broad implications for advancing the field. If successful, DGE could significantly improve sample efficiency in complex tasks that are currently intractable with standard methods, enabling applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and other domains where interaction data is expensive. The approach offers a novel way to leverage unlabeled trajectory data to improve learning efficiency, which aligns with the growing interest in utilizing pre-trained models for downstream tasks. The proposal also contributes to the emerging intersection of generative AI and decision-making, potentially inspiring new research directions. While the immediate impact might be limited to academic research and specific application domains, the long-term significance could be substantial as the approach matures and is adapted to more complex real-world problems."
