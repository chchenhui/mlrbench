    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on combining generative models with decision making, specifically targeting the exploration challenges in sparse reward environments using diffusion models. The proposal thoroughly incorporates the core concept from the research idea of using pre-trained diffusion models to guide exploration through a dual-phase system. It also builds upon the literature review by citing and extending work from papers like Huang et al. (2023), Black et al. (2023), and Tianci et al. (2024). The methodology addresses key topics mentioned in the task description, including 'Exploration in Decision Making,' 'Sample Efficiency,' and 'Transfer Learning.' The only minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions trading labeled reward data for unlabeled environmental data, it could have more explicitly connected to some of the broader topics in the task description such as inverse reinforcement learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The technical details of the diffusion model, intrinsic reward formulation, and algorithm are explained thoroughly with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design section provides a comprehensive overview of the environments, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for how the diffusion model generates 'imagined' novel state sequences could be more explicitly defined; (2) The relationship between the pre-training phase and the exploration phase could be elaborated further, particularly regarding how the pre-trained model is adapted during exploration; and (3) Some technical terms (e.g., DPP sampling) are introduced without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with these concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to exploration in sparse reward environments by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models. The integration of diffusion models for generating exploratory behaviors and the use of Determinantal Point Processes for ensuring trajectory diversity are innovative aspects. The dual-phase system that combines pre-training on state trajectories with guided exploration during training represents a fresh perspective on the exploration problem. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that several components of the approach build directly upon existing methods mentioned in the literature review, such as Diffusion Reward (Huang et al., 2023) and DDPO (Black et al., 2023). The intrinsic reward mechanism, while well-designed, shares similarities with existing novelty-based exploration methods. The proposal would benefit from more clearly articulating its unique contributions beyond combining existing techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established theories of diffusion models, reinforcement learning, and exploration strategies. The mathematical formulations for the diffusion model, intrinsic reward calculation, and trajectory diversity via DPPs are technically correct and appropriately presented. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-chosen environments, baselines, and evaluation metrics that would effectively validate the approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations. However, there are a few areas where the technical soundness could be improved: (1) The proposal does not fully address potential issues with the stability of training diffusion models on trajectory data, which can be high-dimensional and complex; (2) The computational complexity of generating multiple diverse trajectories at each time step is not thoroughly analyzed; and (3) The theoretical guarantees for the exploration efficiency of the proposed approach are not discussed in detail."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined steps for implementation. The two-phase structure (pre-training and exploration) is practical and builds upon established methods in both diffusion modeling and reinforcement learning. The experimental design is realistic, using standard benchmark environments and evaluation metrics. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect the overall feasibility: (1) Training diffusion models on trajectory data requires substantial computational resources, especially for high-dimensional visual environments; (2) Generating multiple diverse trajectories at each time step during training could significantly slow down the learning process; (3) The approach requires a large dataset of state trajectories for pre-training, which might not be readily available for all domains; (4) The hyperparameter tuning for balancing the different reward components (extrinsic, intrinsic, novelty) could be complex and time-consuming. While these challenges don't render the approach infeasible, they do increase the implementation complexity and resource requirements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in reinforcement learning - efficient exploration in sparse reward environments - which has broad implications for the field. If successful, the approach could significantly improve sample efficiency in complex tasks, potentially making reinforcement learning more practical for real-world applications. The expected outcomes include not only improved performance on benchmark tasks but also insights into the relationship between generative models and exploration strategies. The proposal clearly articulates both theoretical implications (bridging generative modeling and reinforcement learning) and practical applications (robotics, autonomous navigation, game AI). The significance is enhanced by the proposal's alignment with current research trends in combining generative models with decision-making algorithms. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on specific types of environments (robotics manipulation, procedurally generated environments) rather than demonstrating broader applicability across diverse domains."

It is well-aligned with the task description, clearly articulated, technically sound, and addresses a significant problem in the field.
