    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'AI Verification in the Wild' by combining probabilistic AI methods (LLMs) with formal verification (interactive theorem provers). The proposal builds upon the cited literature, particularly extending work from LeanDojo, LLMSTEP, COPRA, and Lean Copilot, while addressing the key challenges identified in the literature review. The methodology section comprehensively covers the contextual encoding, tactic generation, and reinforcement learning components outlined in the research idea. The proposal also addresses the special theme of the workshop by focusing on how LLMs can be enhanced through formal structures and execution feedback."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate mathematical formulations and detailed implementation plans. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined, making it easy to understand how success will be measured. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the system with Coq and Lean could be more detailed, (2) the distinction between the retrieval mechanism in LLM-TAC versus existing approaches like LeanDojo could be more explicitly stated, and (3) some technical details about the reinforcement learning implementation (e.g., how the baseline function b(s) is learned) are somewhat underspecified."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a closed-loop reinforcement learning approach to tactic generation that learns from proof execution feedback. This represents a meaningful advancement over existing systems like LLMSTEP and COPRA, which primarily focus on suggesting individual proof steps without the reinforcement learning component. The contextual encoding scheme and the specific reward formulation for partial proof success are also innovative elements. However, the core components of retrieval-augmented LLMs for theorem proving build significantly on existing work (particularly LeanDojo), and the overall approach combines established techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methods. The proposal acknowledges its relationship to prior work but could more explicitly highlight its novel contributions relative to the state-of-the-art."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in both machine learning and formal verification principles, with appropriate mathematical formulations for the reinforcement learning approach. The experimental design includes proper baselines, metrics, and statistical analysis plans. The data collection, preprocessing, and model architecture choices are justified and reasonable. The reward function design for partial proof success is theoretically sound. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes ablation studies to assess the contribution of different components. One minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions variance reduction with a learned baseline, it doesn't fully specify how this baseline is learned or implemented. Additionally, while the approach is generally sound, some assumptions about the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism could benefit from further justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic technical approaches and computational requirements. The implementation details are specific (model architecture, optimizer, learning rates, etc.), and the hardware requirements (8 A100 GPUs) are substantial but attainable for a research project. The data collection strategy leverages existing theorem libraries, and the evaluation plan uses established benchmarks. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) achieving a 50% proof success rate on held-out theorems is ambitious given the current state-of-the-art, (2) the integration with both Coq and Lean simultaneously may introduce additional complexity, and (3) the reinforcement learning approach may face challenges with sparse rewards and long-horizon credit assignment. The proposal would benefit from discussing potential fallback strategies or risk mitigation approaches for these challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in formal verification: the labor-intensive nature of interactive theorem proving. If successful, LLM-TAC could substantially reduce the manual effort required for formal verification, potentially democratizing access to these powerful tools and accelerating the development of verified software and mathematical libraries. The expected 50% reduction in manual tactic writing would represent a major advancement in the field. The proposal clearly articulates both the immediate benefits (time savings, accessibility) and broader impacts (scalability of formal verification, synergy between probabilistic and formal methods). The open-source release of models and code would further amplify the impact by enabling follow-on research. The significance is particularly high given the growing importance of formal verification for critical systems and the current limitations in scaling these approaches."
