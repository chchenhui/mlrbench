    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'Generative AI for formal methods' by proposing LLM-TAC, a framework that uses language models to generate tactics for interactive theorem provers. The proposal maintains fidelity to the original idea of a two-stage framework with contextual encoding, tactic generation and verification, and a reinforcement learning loop. It thoroughly incorporates the challenges identified in the literature review, particularly addressing contextual understanding through its encoding mechanism, tactic generation accuracy through verification feedback, and integration with proof assistants through its pipeline design. The proposal also builds upon the works mentioned in the literature review (LeanDojo, LLMSTEP, COPRA) while clearly differentiating its approach through the reinforcement learning component and comprehensive contextual encoding."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with formal definitions and equations that precisely describe the contextual encoding, tactic generation, verification process, and reinforcement learning components. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas where clarity could be improved: (1) some technical details in the reinforcement learning section could benefit from more explanation of how they would be implemented in practice, (2) the relationship between the verification feedback and the counter-example generation could be more explicitly connected, and (3) the transition between some sections could be smoother to enhance overall flow. Despite these minor issues, the proposal remains highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in several aspects. The integration of a reinforcement learning loop that leverages verification feedback to improve tactic generation is a fresh approach not fully explored in the cited literature. The comprehensive contextual encoding mechanism that combines goal state representation, hypothesis context, and retrieval-augmented library context is also innovative. The counter-example generation for failed tactics adds another novel dimension. However, the core idea of using LLMs for tactic generation builds upon existing work like LeanDojo, LLMSTEP, and COPRA, as acknowledged in the proposal. The retrieval-augmented approach has similarities to LeanDojo's ReProver. While the proposal combines these elements in a new way and adds significant innovations, particularly in the reinforcement learning component, it represents an evolutionary rather than revolutionary advancement in the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in both machine learning and formal verification principles. The contextual encoding approach is theoretically sound, with clear formulations for representing goals, hypotheses, and relevant theorems. The tactic generation pipeline is well-defined with appropriate sampling strategies and verification mechanisms. The reinforcement learning component is based on established algorithms (REINFORCE) with a thoughtfully designed reward function that aligns with the objectives of theorem proving. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies are well-conceived to isolate the contributions of individual components. There are some minor concerns about the scalability of the approach for very large proof contexts and the potential computational cost of the reinforcement learning loop, but these do not significantly detract from the overall soundness of the proposal."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with existing technology, though it will require significant engineering effort. The use of pretrained LLMs as a foundation is practical, and the fine-tuning approach is well-established. The integration with theorem provers like Coq and Lean is achievable, as demonstrated by prior work like LeanDojo and LLMSTEP. The datasets proposed for evaluation are available and appropriate. However, there are several implementation challenges: (1) the computational resources required for fine-tuning large models and running the reinforcement learning loop could be substantial, (2) the integration between the LLM and theorem provers will require careful engineering to handle the bidirectional flow of information, (3) the retrieval-augmented approach may face efficiency challenges with very large libraries, and (4) the counter-example generation mechanism may require sophisticated error analysis. While these challenges are significant, they are likely manageable with appropriate resources and expertise, making the proposal feasible but moderately challenging to implement fully."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical bottleneck in interactive theorem proving: the manual engineering of tactics. By automating this process, LLM-TAC has the potential to significantly reduce the expertise barrier for using formal verification tools, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of bridging AI and formal methods. The expected outcome of a 50% reduction in manual tactic writing would represent a substantial improvement in proof development efficiency. The broader impacts identified—democratization of formal methods, acceleration of verified software development, bridging AI and formal methods, educational applications, and new research directions—are all meaningful and well-justified. The proposal could lead to transformative changes in how researchers and developers interact with theorem provers, potentially expanding the adoption of formal methods across various domains. While the immediate impact might be limited to the formal methods community, the long-term implications for software verification and mathematical formalization are far-reaching."
