    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The LLM-TAC proposal aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on the intersection of AI and verification. It directly addresses the 'Generative AI for formal methods' theme by using LLMs to generate tactics for interactive theorem provers. The proposal also incorporates verification feedback loops where generated tactics are mechanically verified, which matches the workshop's interest in combining probabilistic methods with formal verification. The reinforcement learning component further demonstrates how AI can be guided by formal verification outcomes. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address the special theme of code generation, though theorem proving tactics are closely related to programming."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The three-stage framework (Contextual Encoding, Tactic Generation & Verification, Reinforcement Loop) provides a clear structure for understanding the approach. The proposal articulates specific systems (Coq, Lean) where the approach would be applied and includes concrete expected outcomes (50% reduction in manual tactic writing). However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as the specific architecture of the retrieval-augmented transformer, how the counter-examples are utilized, and what specific reinforcement learning algorithms would be employed. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining LLMs with interactive theorem proving in a feedback loop. While there have been previous attempts to automate tactic generation using machine learning (such as TacticToe, CoqHammer, and more recent LLM applications to theorem proving), this proposal's integration of mechanical verification with reinforcement learning from proof feedback creates a novel approach. The retrieval-augmented encoding of the proof context is also a valuable innovation. However, it builds upon existing work in both LLMs for theorem proving and reinforcement learning from formal verification feedback, rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible with current technology. LLMs have already demonstrated capabilities in code generation and logical reasoning tasks. The integration with interactive theorem provers like Coq and Lean is technically achievable, as these systems have APIs that allow for programmatic interaction. The reinforcement learning component is also well-established. The main implementation challenges would likely be in effectively encoding the proof context and designing appropriate reward signals for the reinforcement learning loop. The 50% reduction in manual tactic writing is an ambitious but potentially achievable goal, given recent advances in LLMs. The proposal loses points on feasibility primarily because integrating with formal systems often reveals unexpected complexities, and the reinforcement learning component may require significant tuning."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is very high. Interactive theorem proving is a critical bottleneck in formal verification, requiring substantial expertise and manual effort. Automating tactic generation could dramatically accelerate the development of verified software and formalized mathematics, potentially transforming how these fields progress. The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in scaling formal methods, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals. If successful, this approach could significantly lower barriers to using interactive theorem provers, enabling broader adoption of formal verification techniques across computer science and mathematics. The potential impact on both academic research and practical applications in verified software development justifies the high significance score."
