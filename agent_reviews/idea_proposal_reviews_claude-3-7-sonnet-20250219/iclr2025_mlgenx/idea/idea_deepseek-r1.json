        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description, particularly with the Special Track on LLMs and Agentic AI. It directly addresses multiple listed topics including RAG, knowledge graphs, RL with lab feedback, efficient interactive system designs involving agents and biological tools, and LLM-powered design and planning engines. The proposal also touches on perturbation biology, experimental design, and uncertainty quantification from the Main Track. The focus on genomic perturbations for understanding disease mechanisms perfectly matches the workshop's goal of bridging machine learning and genomics for target identification and drug discovery."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, approach, and expected outcomes. The proposal defines a specific application (genomic perturbation design), the technical approach (RAG-enhanced LLMs with knowledge graphs), and the learning framework (active learning with lab-in-the-loop reinforcement). The integration of these components is logically presented. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as how uncertainty estimates will be calculated, the specific structure of the biological knowledge graph, and how the system will interface with automated lab tools. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates strong originality by combining several cutting-edge approaches in a novel way. The integration of RAG-enhanced LLMs with biological knowledge graphs for genomic perturbation design represents a fresh approach. The lab-in-the-loop learning system that iteratively updates based on experimental results is particularly innovative, as most current AI genomics models lack this feedback mechanism. While individual components (LLMs, RAG, knowledge graphs, RLHF) exist separately, their combination for this specific application and the closed-loop system with lab automation represents a novel contribution to the field. It's not entirely unprecedented, as similar approaches have been explored in other scientific domains, but the application to genomic perturbations is relatively new."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal faces several implementation challenges that affect its feasibility. While LLMs, RAG, and knowledge graphs are established technologies, their integration with automated lab systems requires significant engineering effort. The lab-in-the-loop learning system depends on experimental validation, which introduces time delays, costs, and potential bottlenecks. Building a comprehensive biological knowledge graph with sufficient quality for this application is also resource-intensive. Additionally, the reinforcement learning component with lab feedback would require careful design of reward functions that accurately reflect biological success. These challenges don't make the idea impractical, but they do suggest a substantial implementation effort and potential timeline extensions. The proposal would benefit from addressing how these challenges would be mitigated."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical problem in genomics and drug discovery - the lack of causal understanding of disease mechanisms. If successful, this approach could significantly accelerate gene therapy design by reducing trial-and-error cycles and providing more targeted interventions. The potential impact extends beyond the specific application to broader genomics research, as the framework could be adapted for other perturbation studies. The creation of a benchmark dataset linking AI-proposed edits to multi-omics readouts would be valuable for the entire field. The approach directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging machine learning and genomics for drug discovery, with potential to transform how genomic experiments are designed and interpreted. The significance is high because it could lead to more efficient discovery of therapeutic targets and ultimately improve patient outcomes."
