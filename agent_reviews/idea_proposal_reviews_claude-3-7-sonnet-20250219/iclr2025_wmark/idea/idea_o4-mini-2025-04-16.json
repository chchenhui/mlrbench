        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on GenAI watermarking. It directly addresses the core topics of algorithmic advances (dual-layer approach), adversarial robustness (through the removal game), and evaluation (proposing benchmarks). The idea also considers industry requirements by mentioning deployment protocols. The only minor gap is that while policy and ethics are implied in the motivation (deterring misuse), they aren't explicitly developed in the proposal."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, approach, and expected outcomes. The dual-layer watermarking concept is explained concisely, distinguishing between token-level embedding and latent-space perturbations. The dynamic key-rotation and adversarial training components are also well-defined. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as how exactly the differentiable attacker network operates and how the key-rotation mechanism is implemented across different modalities."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining two watermarking approaches into a dual-layer framework, which is not common in current literature. The dynamic key-rotation mechanism and the adversarial 'removal game' training approach add innovative elements. However, both token-level watermarking and latent-space perturbations have been explored separately in prior work, so the innovation lies primarily in their combination and the adversarial training framework rather than in fundamentally new watermarking techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible with current technology. The token-level embedding during decoding and latent-space perturbations are implementable with existing generative models. The adversarial training approach has precedents in other domains. However, achieving the ambitious goals (>95% survival rates with <1% quality degradation) may prove challenging, especially across diverse content types and transformation attacks. The computational resources required for the adversarial training could also be substantial, and balancing watermark robustness against generation quality presents a non-trivial optimization challenge."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical problem in the generative AI field: creating robust, attack-resistant watermarks. The significance is high given the growing concerns about AI-generated content misuse and the need for reliable attribution. If successful, the approach could establish new standards for watermark security and provide valuable tools for content verification. The open benchmark contribution would also benefit the broader research community. The impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in content authentication, copyright protection, and potentially regulatory compliance."
