        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on GenAI watermarking. It directly addresses the 'Adversarial robustness and security-related topics' mentioned in the workshop topics, proposing a framework specifically designed to enhance watermark resilience against removal attacks. The idea also touches on 'Algorithmic advances' by introducing a novel adversarial training approach for watermarking. The proposal is highly relevant to the workshop's goal of advancing watermarking technologies in generative AI."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (brittleness of current watermarks), proposes a specific solution (adversarial training framework), and explains the mechanism (joint optimization of embedder/detector with an adversary network). The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details - for example, the specific architectures of the networks are not described, and the exact implementation across different modalities (images vs. text) could be further elaborated. However, these are reasonable omissions for a research idea summary."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by applying adversarial training specifically to watermarking in generative AI. While adversarial training itself is not new in machine learning, its application to create robust watermarks for GenAI outputs represents a fresh approach. The concept of jointly optimizing embedding, detection, and adversarial removal is innovative in this context. However, similar adversarial approaches have been explored in traditional digital watermarking and related domains like adversarial examples, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Adversarial training frameworks are well-established in machine learning, and the components required (watermark embedders, detectors, and adversarial networks) can be implemented using existing deep learning architectures. The main challenges would be in balancing the competing objectives (watermark robustness vs. output quality) and ensuring the approach works across diverse types of generative outputs. However, these challenges appear manageable given the current state of ML research and infrastructure."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI governance and content provenance. As generative AI becomes more widespread, robust watermarking is essential for tracking AI-generated content and mitigating potential misuse. The proposed approach could significantly improve watermark resilience against removal attempts, making watermarking more trustworthy for real-world applications. This has important implications for policy, regulation, and trust in AI systems - all key concerns mentioned in the workshop description. The potential impact extends beyond technical improvements to broader societal benefits."
