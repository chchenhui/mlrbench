    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on watermarking in generative AI, particularly emphasizing adversarial robustness and security - a core topic mentioned in the task description. The proposal builds upon the literature review by acknowledging recent works like InvisMark and Certifiable Robust Image Watermark while identifying their limitations (static embedding schemes). The dynamic adversarial training framework directly implements the main idea from the research idea document, creating a zero-sum game between watermark embedder and adversarial attackers. The proposal includes comprehensive evaluation metrics that align with industry requirements mentioned in the task description. The only minor inconsistency is that while the task description mentions policy and ethics landscapes, the proposal addresses these aspects somewhat briefly in the broader impacts section rather than as a central focus."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined with specific, measurable goals (e.g., PSNR ≥ 50 dB, SSIM ≥ 0.995). The methodology section provides detailed explanations of model architectures, loss functions, and training algorithms with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying baselines, evaluation metrics, and protocols. The timeline is realistic and well-structured. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the adversarial attack ensemble and the minimax optimization could be explained more intuitively, (2) some technical terms (e.g., BCE in the loss functions) are not defined, and (3) the exact mechanism for how the adversarial models evolve over time could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a dynamic adversarial training framework for watermarking that continuously adapts to evolving threats. This approach differs from existing methods like InvisMark and VINE that use more static embedding techniques. The concept of co-training a watermark embedder with multiple adversarial attack models in a zero-sum game is innovative in the watermarking context. However, the core techniques build upon established adversarial training methods from other domains of machine learning. The U-Net architecture for the embedder and ResNet for the detector are standard choices rather than novel architectures. While the proposal combines existing concepts in a new way for watermarking, it doesn't introduce fundamentally new theoretical frameworks or algorithmic innovations. The novelty lies primarily in the application and adaptation of adversarial training to the specific problem of watermark robustness."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for the loss functions and minimax optimization are well-defined and appropriate for the task. The adversarial training approach is grounded in established game-theoretic principles. The methodology includes both fixed classical attacks and learned removers, providing a comprehensive approach to robustness. The evaluation protocol is thorough, with appropriate metrics and baselines from recent literature. The hyperparameters are explicitly stated, and the training algorithm is clearly outlined. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from additional justification: (1) the choice of 256-bit payload size could be better motivated, (2) the specific weights in the loss function (λ=1.0, β=0.01, μ=0.5, α_adv=0.1) lack detailed justification, and (3) the proposal could benefit from theoretical analysis of convergence properties or robustness guarantees. Overall, the approach is technically sound with minor gaps in theoretical justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic objectives and timeline. The data sources (FFHQ and ImageNet) are publicly available, and the model architectures (U-Net, ResNet-50) are well-established and implementable. The training algorithm is clearly defined and follows standard practices. The 12-month timeline appears reasonable for the scope of work. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) training with high-resolution images (1024×1024) will require substantial computational resources, (2) the dynamic adversarial training with multiple attack models may face convergence issues or instability, (3) the proposal mentions using a pretrained diffusion inpaint model but doesn't specify which one or how it will be integrated, and (4) the evaluation against unseen attacks may be difficult to standardize. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they represent significant hurdles that may require additional resources or methodological adjustments during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the field of generative AI - creating robust watermarks that can withstand adversarial attacks while remaining imperceptible. This has significant implications for content authentication, provenance tracking, and misinformation prevention. The expected outcomes include watermarks with ≥95% detection accuracy under aggressive distortions, which would represent a substantial improvement over current methods. The broader impacts section effectively highlights applications in industry deployment, policy and regulation, and ethical use cases. The dissemination plan includes open-source code release and a new benchmark suite (DAT-Bench), which could benefit the wider research community. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's alignment with industry requirements for scalable, secure content authentication. However, the impact may be somewhat limited by the focus primarily on image watermarking rather than addressing the full spectrum of generative AI outputs (text, audio, video, etc.), and the proposal could more explicitly address how the approach might generalize beyond images."
