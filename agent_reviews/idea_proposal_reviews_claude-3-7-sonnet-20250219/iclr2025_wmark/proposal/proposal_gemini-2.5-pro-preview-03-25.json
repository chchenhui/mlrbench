    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on GenAI watermarking, particularly the topics of 'algorithmic advances,' 'adversarial robustness,' and 'evaluation and benchmarks.' The Dynamic Adversarial Training (DAT) framework aligns perfectly with the research idea of co-training a watermark embedder with adversarial attack models. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works like InvisMark (Xu et al., 2024), Jiang et al. (2024), and Lu et al. (2024), and directly addresses the key challenges identified, particularly adversarial robustness and generalization to unseen attacks. The methodology is comprehensive and consistent with both the task requirements and the initial research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design, including baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly described. The only minor issues preventing a perfect score are: (1) some mathematical notations could benefit from additional explanation for broader accessibility, and (2) the relationship between the different loss components (perceptual, robustness, adversarial) could be more explicitly connected to the overall min-max optimization objective. Nevertheless, the proposal remains highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a fresh approach to GenAI watermarking by introducing a dynamic adversarial training framework specifically designed for watermark robustness. While adversarial training itself is not new in machine learning, its application to watermarking in the context of generative AI content with a dynamic suite of adversaries represents a novel contribution. The proposal acknowledges that Thakkar et al. (2023) touched upon integrating adversarial training, but correctly identifies that a dedicated framework dynamically co-adapting watermark embedding and attack simulation is underexplored for GenAI watermarking. The approach of using multiple diverse adversaries (both fixed and learned) to enhance generalization is innovative. However, the core techniques (adversarial training, encoder-decoder architectures for watermarking) build upon existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts, which prevents a higher novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulation of the min-max optimization problem is well-defined, with clear loss functions for both the embedder/detector and the adversaries. The training procedure alternates between optimizing the watermarking system and the attack models, which is a sound approach for adversarial training. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, including appropriate metrics for imperceptibility (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) and robustness (BER, detection accuracy). The proposal also includes ablation studies to analyze different components of the framework. The baseline comparisons are well-chosen from the literature. The only minor limitations are: (1) the exact architecture details of the adversarial attack models could be more specific, and (2) some theoretical analysis of convergence properties or robustness guarantees would strengthen the soundness further."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technology and methods. The components required (neural network architectures for embedding/detection, differentiable approximations of standard attacks, adversarial training) are all established techniques in machine learning. The datasets proposed (ImageNet, MS-COCO) are readily available, and the generative models mentioned (Stable Diffusion, StyleGAN) are accessible. The evaluation metrics are standard and measurable. However, there are some implementation challenges that might affect feasibility: (1) creating differentiable approximations of all the proposed attacks could be technically challenging, (2) the adversarial training process with multiple adversaries might require significant computational resources and careful tuning to ensure convergence, and (3) the min-max optimization might face stability issues common in adversarial training. These challenges are manageable but non-trivial, justifying the score of 7."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the field of generative AI - ensuring the robustness of watermarks against adversarial attacks. This is highly significant for establishing trust in AI-generated content, protecting intellectual property, and combating misinformation. The expected outcomes align well with industry needs for reliable content provenance verification. If successful, the DAT framework could significantly advance the state-of-the-art in watermark robustness while maintaining imperceptibility. The potential applications span multiple domains including media forensics, content authentication, and copyright protection. The proposal also contributes to the methodological advancement of adversarial training in security applications. The significance is somewhat limited by the initial focus on images only (though with potential extension to text), and the fact that watermarking is just one approach to content provenance among several alternatives. Nevertheless, the potential impact on both academic research and practical applications is substantial."
