    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on watermarking in generative AI, particularly emphasizing adversarial robustness and evaluation benchmarks. The proposal builds upon the literature review by citing and extending works like InvisMark [1], REMARK-LLM [4], and others, while addressing the key challenges identified in the review, such as adversarial robustness, imperceptibility-robustness trade-offs, and generalization to unseen attacks. The methodology clearly implements the dynamic adversarial training framework outlined in the research idea, creating a co-training system between watermark embedders and adversarial attackers. The only minor inconsistency is that the proposal could have more explicitly addressed the policy and ethics landscape mentioned in the workshop topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with logical organization into introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes sections. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is well-defined with mathematical formulations. The experimental design, including baselines, training protocols, and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly explained. The multi-modal approach (covering both image and text watermarking) is clearly differentiated with domain-specific architectures and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of the adversarial attackers could be more specific, (2) the relationship between the detector D and the overall framework could be better explained, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., WGP optimizer) are used without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with these concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a dynamic adversarial training framework specifically for watermarking generative AI outputs. While adversarial training itself is not new (as acknowledged by reference [8]), its application to the watermarking domain and the specific co-evolution framework between embedders and attackers represents a fresh approach. The multi-modal implementation across both text and image domains adds to its novelty. The proposal clearly differentiates itself from prior work like InvisMark [1] and REMARK-LLM [4] by emphasizing adaptability to evolving threats rather than static embedding strategies. However, the core techniques (U-Net for images, token distribution modification for text) build upon established methods rather than introducing fundamentally new architectures, which somewhat limits the degree of innovation. The proposal is innovative but not entirely groundbreaking."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulation of the adversarial loss function is well-defined, and the approach is grounded in established techniques from adversarial training and watermarking literature. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive, covering both robustness (detection accuracy, bit accuracy) and imperceptibility (SSIM, PSNR, BERTScore). The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, cross-validation, and statistical validation. The domain-specific architectures for image and text watermarking are technically sound and justified. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) the exact mechanism for balancing the mini-max game during training could be more detailed to ensure convergence, (2) the hyperparameter selection process could be more systematically defined beyond grid search, and (3) the theoretical guarantees for robustness against specific attack types could be more formally established."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The use of existing datasets (ImageNet, Wikipedia, Common Crawl) and established evaluation metrics makes implementation practical. The technical approach builds on well-understood components (U-Net, token distribution modification) rather than requiring entirely new architectures. The experimental design is comprehensive but manageable. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) the co-training of adversarial models may face convergence issues or instability, requiring careful optimization, (2) the computational resources needed for training multiple adversarial models simultaneously could be substantial, (3) the human evaluation component via Amazon Mechanical Turk adds complexity and potential variability, and (4) achieving the ambitious performance targets (≥95% detection accuracy under 10+ attack types while maintaining SSIM ≥0.995) may prove challenging in practice. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present significant hurdles that would require careful management."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in generative AI security with substantial potential impact. Robust watermarking is essential for content authentication, copyright protection, and misinformation prevention as generative AI becomes more widespread. The work directly supports regulatory compliance (EU AI Act, GDPR) and industry needs for content provenance verification. The expected outcomes, if achieved, would represent meaningful advances over current state-of-the-art methods like InvisMark and REMARK-LLM. The proposal's significance is enhanced by its multi-modal approach, addressing both image and text watermarking in a unified framework. The potential for standardizing evaluation through W-Bench integration could benefit the broader research community. However, the impact is somewhat limited by focusing primarily on technical solutions without deeply exploring the social, ethical, or policy implications of watermarking technology. Additionally, while the performance improvements are meaningful, they represent incremental rather than transformative advances in the field."
