        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on watermarking in generative AI, particularly emphasizing adversarial robustness and algorithmic advances. The proposal comprehensively incorporates the core concept from the research idea of using dynamic adversarial training to enhance watermark robustness against attacks. The literature review is thoroughly integrated throughout the proposal, with specific references to works like InvisMark, Unigram-Watermark, and REMARK-LLM, and the proposal addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as the imperceptibility-robustness trade-off and generalization to unseen attacks. The methodology section clearly builds upon existing approaches while proposing novel extensions to address their limitations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The mathematical formulation is precise and well-defined, making the technical approach easy to understand. The watermark generator architecture, adversarial attack models, and training procedures are all explained in detail with appropriate equations and algorithms. The evaluation metrics are comprehensively outlined, providing a clear framework for assessing the proposed solution. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as more specific details on how the meta-attack model learns to combine multiple attack strategies, and further elaboration on how the curriculum learning approach would be implemented in practice. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity of the proposal is strong, with logical flow and well-defined components."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to watermarking through its dynamic adversarial training framework. While adversarial training itself is not new, the application to watermarking in a co-evolutionary framework that simultaneously evolves both watermark embedding techniques and attack models is innovative. The multi-scale architecture for watermark embedding and the meta-attack model that learns to combine multiple attack strategies are particularly original contributions. The proposal extends beyond existing works like InvisMark and Unigram-Watermark by shifting from static embedding techniques to adaptive strategies that evolve in response to emerging threats. The integration of uncertainty estimation in the watermark detector and the curriculum learning approach for training also add novelty. However, some individual components build upon existing techniques, which slightly reduces the overall novelty score. Nevertheless, the comprehensive framework and its application to cross-modal content represent a significant advancement over the current state of the art."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and soundness in its approach. The mathematical formulation is well-developed, with clear definitions of the watermark generator, adversarial attack models, and detector components. The minimax optimization framework is appropriate for the adversarial setting, and the loss functions are well-designed to balance detection accuracy, perceptual quality, and adversarial robustness. The multi-scale architecture for watermark embedding is theoretically well-founded, and the diverse suite of attack models covers a comprehensive range of potential vulnerabilities. The training procedure, including alternating optimization and curriculum learning, is methodologically sound and aligns with established practices in adversarial machine learning. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and appropriate for assessing both robustness and imperceptibility. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and trade-offs, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the problem space. Overall, the technical foundations of the proposal are robust and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach, though with some implementation challenges. The data collection plan using established datasets like COCO, ImageNet, C4, and WikiText is practical and accessible. The experimental design is comprehensive and well-structured, with clear evaluation protocols. However, the computational requirements for training the proposed framework, particularly the adversarial co-evolution process, could be substantial and may require significant computational resources. The complexity of implementing and coordinating multiple attack models simultaneously during training presents another challenge. The proposal would benefit from more specific details on computational requirements, training time estimates, and potential optimizations to improve efficiency. Additionally, while the cross-modal application (across images, text, audio) is ambitious, the proposal does not fully detail how the framework would be adapted to each modality, which may introduce additional implementation complexities. Despite these challenges, the core approach is implementable with current technology and methods, making the overall proposal feasible with appropriate resources and refinements."
