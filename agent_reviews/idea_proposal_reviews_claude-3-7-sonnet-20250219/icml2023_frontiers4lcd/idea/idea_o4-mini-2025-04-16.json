    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The Score-Control idea aligns excellently with the task description, addressing multiple topics explicitly mentioned in the workshop call. It directly connects to stochastic optimal control, diffusion models, stochastic processes, and implicitly relates to neural SDEs. The proposal bridges learning and control theory, which is the central theme of the workshop. It specifically addresses the challenge of solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDEs in high dimensions, offering a machine learning approach to enhance control theory algorithms in terms of performance and scalability - exactly what the workshop seeks to explore."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure: motivation, approach, and potential impact. The core concept of using score-based diffusion for stochastic optimal control is explained coherently. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific form of the reverse-time SDE, how the system's drift is incorporated, and what specific approximate dynamic programming or model predictive control methods are used to generate the pseudo ground-truth trajectories. The training procedure is outlined but lacks specifics on loss functions and optimization strategies. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a higher clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel integration of score-based diffusion models with stochastic optimal control. While both score-based diffusion models and stochastic optimal control are established fields, their combination in this manner appears to be innovative. The approach of learning a neural score function to approximate the gradient of the log-density of near-optimal trajectories and using it within a reverse-time SDE for control is a fresh perspective. The model-free approach that bypasses explicit HJB solutions represents a meaningful advancement over traditional methods. It's not entirely revolutionary as it builds upon existing concepts, but the specific combination and application to control problems appears to be original."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of the Score-Control approach faces several challenges. While the individual components (score-based diffusion models, approximate dynamic programming) are established, their integration presents complexity. The proposal requires generating high-quality pseudo ground-truth trajectories, which might be computationally expensive for complex systems. Training stable score networks for trajectory distributions could be challenging, especially for high-dimensional state-action spaces. The claim of sampling control trajectories 'in just a few diffusion steps' may be optimistic given the known challenges with accelerating diffusion sampling. Additionally, the performance in uncertain dynamical systems needs empirical validation. The approach is theoretically implementable but would require significant engineering effort and careful design choices."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is substantial as it addresses a fundamental challenge in control theory - the curse of dimensionality in solving HJB equations. If successful, this approach could enable scalable control for high-dimensional systems where traditional methods fail. The potential impact extends to various domains requiring robust control under uncertainty, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and complex industrial processes. By unifying generative modeling with stochastic control, it opens new theoretical connections between machine learning and control theory. The approach also naturally handles stochasticity, which is crucial for real-world applications. The significance is limited only by the need for empirical validation and potential scalability challenges in extremely high-dimensional systems."
