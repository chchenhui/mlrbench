        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging gaps between ML research and regulatory principles by proposing an automated framework to translate regulatory text into ML constraints. The three-stage framework (Regulatory NLP, Formalization, and Constrained Optimization) perfectly matches the original idea, and the proposal incorporates relevant literature extensively. For example, it cites LegiLM (Zhu et al., 2024) for legal language models, references Ershov's (2023) work on knowledge graphs for compliance, and builds upon Shaikh et al.'s (2017) research on fairness policies. The case studies on credit scoring and GDPR compliance align with both the workshop topics and cited literature (e.g., Rida, 2024; Marino et al., 2025). The proposal comprehensively addresses the challenge of operationalizing regulatory principles in ML systems, which is central to the workshop's theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-stage framework is logically presented with detailed explanations of each component. The research objectives (O1-O5) are explicitly stated and well-defined. The methodology section provides specific technical details, including mathematical formulations for constraint penalties and optimization objectives. The case studies are clearly described with relevant datasets and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for handling ambiguities in legal text interpretation could be more detailed, (2) the proposal could more explicitly address how conflicts between different regulatory requirements would be resolved in the optimization process, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the NLP component could be more specific. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity is strong, making the research approach and expected outcomes readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly innovative approach to a critical problem in ML regulation. While individual components (legal NLP, constrained optimization) have been explored separately in prior work, the end-to-end integration of these components into a comprehensive framework for automated regulatory compliance is novel. The proposal innovates particularly in: (1) the automated extraction and formalization of regulatory requirements from legal text, extending beyond the manual approaches mentioned in the literature review; (2) the systematic translation of legal norms into differentiable penalty functions suitable for ML optimization; and (3) the multi-objective optimization approach to balance compliance with multiple regulatory constraints. The proposal builds upon existing work (e.g., Ershov's knowledge graphs, Wang et al.'s ACT framework) but extends them in new directions. While some aspects like using NLP for legal text analysis or fairness constraints in ML are not entirely new, the comprehensive integration and specific application to regulatory compliance represents a fresh and valuable contribution to the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The three-stage framework is logically structured and builds upon established techniques in NLP, formal methods, and constrained optimization. The mathematical formulations for penalty functions and optimization objectives are technically correct. The proposal appropriately references relevant literature to support its approaches, such as using transformer-based models for legal NLP and multi-objective optimization techniques for handling multiple constraints. However, there are some areas where the technical foundations could be strengthened: (1) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the challenge of handling non-differentiable logical constraints in gradient-based optimization; (2) while the proposal mentions potential conflicts between regulatory requirements, it doesn't provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for resolving these conflicts; and (3) the evaluation methodology, while reasonable, could benefit from more rigorous statistical validation plans. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan, though with significant implementation challenges. On the positive side: (1) the individual components (NLP models, constraint formulation, optimization techniques) all use existing technologies and methods; (2) the case studies are well-defined with available datasets; and (3) the staged approach allows for incremental development and testing. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) accurately extracting and formalizing regulatory requirements from complex legal text is extremely challenging and may require more sophisticated NLP techniques than proposed; (2) translating logical constraints into differentiable penalties that faithfully represent the original requirements is non-trivial and may introduce approximation errors; (3) balancing multiple potentially conflicting constraints while maintaining model performance may prove difficult in practice; and (4) the comprehensive evaluation across multiple regulations and domains is ambitious within a typical research timeframe. While the proposal acknowledges some of these challenges, it may underestimate the difficulty of achieving high accuracy in the legal NLP component and the complexity of handling conflicting regulatory requirements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a problem of exceptional significance in the field of regulatable ML. The gap between regulatory text and ML implementation is a critical bottleneck in developing compliant AI systems, as highlighted in the workshop description. The potential impact is substantial across multiple stakeholders: (1) for ML practitioners, it could dramatically reduce the effort and expertise required to develop compliant systems; (2) for regulators, it could provide more verifiable and consistent implementations of regulatory principles; (3) for organizations, it could reduce legal and reputational risks while lowering compliance costs; and (4) for society, it could lead to more trustworthy and accountable AI systems. The open-source toolkit and empirical benchmarks would provide valuable resources for the research community. The proposal directly addresses core challenges identified in the literature review, particularly the complexity of legal text interpretation and the formalization of legal norms. If successful, this research could fundamentally transform how regulatory compliance is approached in ML development, making it more systematic, scalable, and verifiable."
