        "justification": "The Multifaceted Stakeholder Triangulation Framework aligns excellently with the task's focus on evaluating the broader impacts of generative AI. It directly addresses the task's emphasis on broadening participation beyond just ML/AI experts by incorporating three stakeholder groups: technical developers, domain experts, and affected communities. The framework also responds to the task's goal of creating standardized evaluation practices through its tiered evaluation structure and documentation template. It tackles the identified gap of no standard existing for impact assessments, which is a central concern of the workshop. The only minor limitation is that while it addresses most topics listed (methodology sharing, community-built evaluations, standardization), it could more explicitly address barriers to adoption and policy recommendations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a well-structured framework with three specific components: (1) tiered evaluation structure, (2) deliberative process, and (3) documentation template. The implementation approach through workshops, surveys, and assessment tools is clearly articulated. The motivation and problem statement are well-defined, identifying specific gaps in current evaluation approaches. However, some minor ambiguities remain about the exact metrics to be used for each stakeholder group and how potential conflicts between stakeholder perspectives would be resolved. The operational details of the 'deliberative process' could benefit from further elaboration to make the implementation path completely clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality in its triangulation approach that systematically integrates three distinct stakeholder perspectives into a unified framework. While multi-stakeholder approaches exist in other domains, the application to generative AI impact assessment with a standardized methodology represents a fresh perspective. The tiered evaluation structure that accommodates different expertise levels is an innovative element. However, the core concepts of stakeholder inclusion and participatory methods build upon existing evaluation approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new methodologies. The framework combines known participatory design principles with standardization needs in a new context, making it innovative but not revolutionary in its methodological approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The framework is largely feasible with existing methodologies and practices. Participatory workshops, structured surveys, and assessment tools are well-established methods that can be adapted to this context. The standardization of metrics and documentation templates is achievable with proper design. However, there are moderate implementation challenges to consider: (1) recruiting and maintaining engagement from diverse affected communities may require significant resources and careful planning; (2) balancing the potentially conflicting perspectives of different stakeholder groups will require thoughtful facilitation; (3) creating metrics that are meaningful across all three stakeholder groups while remaining comparable will require careful design work. These challenges are surmountable but will require dedicated effort and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in generative AI evaluation that has substantial implications for responsible AI development and deployment. By systematically incorporating perspectives from affected communities alongside technical and domain experts, the framework could significantly improve the comprehensiveness of impact assessments and help identify harms that might otherwise be overlooked. The standardization aspect enables cross-system comparisons and longitudinal tracking, which could substantially advance the field's understanding of generative AI impacts over time. The approach could influence industry practices, academic research, and potentially policy development around AI governance. Its significance is particularly high given the rapid deployment of generative AI systems and growing concerns about their societal impacts."
