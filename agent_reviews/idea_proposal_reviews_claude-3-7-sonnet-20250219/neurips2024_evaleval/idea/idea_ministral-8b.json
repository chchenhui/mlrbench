    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the need for standardized evaluation practices for generative AI's broader impacts, which is the central focus of the workshop. The proposed Collaborative Community-Driven Evaluation Framework (CCDEF) specifically targets the 'critical gap' mentioned in the task by bringing together diverse stakeholders, just as the workshop aims to broaden participation beyond ML/AI experts. The idea's components—stakeholder mapping, methodological development, community collaboration, pilot studies, and documentation/standardization—directly correspond to the workshop's topics of sharing methodologies, developing community-built evaluations, addressing adoption barriers, and creating standardization frameworks. The only minor limitation is that policy recommendations, while implied in the research idea, could be more explicitly addressed."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity and structure. It clearly articulates the motivation, main components, and expected outcomes of the proposed framework. The five-step methodology provides a concrete roadmap for implementation. The stakeholder engagement process, collaborative approach, and documentation system are all well-defined. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further elaboration: the specific metrics to be developed, the exact mechanisms for resolving potential conflicts between stakeholder perspectives, and more detailed timelines for implementation. Despite these minor ambiguities, the overall concept is well-articulated and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to generative AI evaluation. While impact assessment frameworks exist in various domains, the specific focus on a community-driven, collaborative approach for generative AI is relatively fresh. The integration of diverse stakeholders beyond technical experts represents an innovative shift from traditional evaluation methods that are often siloed within technical communities. However, the core components of the framework—stakeholder engagement, methodology development, and standardization—build upon established practices in responsible AI and technology assessment rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The novelty lies more in the application and integration of these approaches specifically for generative AI impact assessment rather than in creating entirely new evaluation paradigms."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the step-by-step methodology provides a clear implementation path, and similar multi-stakeholder frameworks have been successfully implemented in other domains. However, significant challenges exist: coordinating diverse stakeholders with potentially conflicting interests will be complex; developing universally accepted metrics for subjective impacts is difficult; ensuring sustained community engagement requires substantial resources; and achieving consensus across different disciplines and sectors may prove challenging. The pilot studies are a practical approach to testing, but scaling from pilots to widespread adoption would require significant institutional buy-in. While the framework is conceptually implementable, these practical hurdles reduce its immediate feasibility without substantial resources and coordination efforts."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposed research addresses a critical and timely need in the field of generative AI. As these technologies rapidly proliferate throughout society, the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks represents a significant gap that could lead to overlooked harms and missed opportunities. By creating a comprehensive, community-driven framework, this research could fundamentally improve how we assess and mitigate the societal impacts of generative AI systems. The potential benefits extend beyond academic contributions to include practical tools for developers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. The framework could influence policy decisions, industry practices, and public understanding of generative AI impacts. Given the increasing prominence of generative AI in various sectors, establishing robust evaluation standards now could have far-reaching and long-lasting positive effects on how these technologies are developed and deployed."
