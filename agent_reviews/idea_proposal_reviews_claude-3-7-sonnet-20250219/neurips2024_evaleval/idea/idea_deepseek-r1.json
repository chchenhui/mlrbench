    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the need for standardized evaluation frameworks for generative AI's societal impacts with multi-stakeholder participation, which is the central focus of the workshop. The proposal emphasizes broadening expertise beyond technical experts to include ethicists, educators, policymakers, and affected communities, perfectly matching the workshop's key focus on 'Breadth of Participation.' The co-design methodology addresses multiple workshop topics including developing community-built evaluations, creating frameworks for documenting evaluation practices, and potentially informing policy recommendations. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly discuss barriers to broader adoption of social impact evaluations, though the approach implicitly addresses this through its inclusive design."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured with clear components: motivation, main idea, methodologies, and expected outcomes. The proposal clearly defines its approach (co-design workshops and Delphi exercises), stakeholders (ethicists, educators, policymakers, affected communities), and deliverables (toolkit with evaluation protocols). The validation strategy through pilot evaluations in education and media is also well-specified. However, some minor ambiguities remain: the exact mechanics of the co-design process could be more detailed, the specific metrics for comparing the framework to traditional approaches aren't fully elaborated, and the timeline for implementation isn't specified. These minor points prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by proposing a systematic co-design approach to generative AI evaluation that centers diverse stakeholder participation. While participatory design and multi-stakeholder approaches exist in other domains, applying this methodology specifically to generative AI evaluation frameworks represents a fresh perspective. The integration of Delphi consensus-building with technical evaluation metrics is innovative. However, the core components (participatory design, mixed-methods evaluation) are established methodologies being applied to a new context rather than fundamentally new approaches. The idea builds upon existing evaluation practices rather than introducing radically new concepts, which is why it scores well but not at the highest level of novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with existing methodologies and resources. Co-design workshops, Delphi methods, and mixed-method evaluations are established approaches with proven track records. The proposal to create a publicly adaptable toolkit is practical and implementable. However, there are moderate challenges that prevent a higher feasibility score: (1) coordinating diverse stakeholders across different domains requires significant logistical effort; (2) achieving meaningful consensus among stakeholders with potentially conflicting interests may be difficult; (3) validating the framework across different contexts (education and media) adds complexity; and (4) ensuring that marginalized communities are genuinely represented rather than tokenized requires careful implementation. These challenges are surmountable but require considerable resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in current AI evaluation practices at a time when generative AI is rapidly being deployed across society. Its significance is high because: (1) it directly tackles the problem of narrow, technically-focused evaluations that miss real-world harms; (2) it provides a structured methodology for including diverse perspectives in evaluation, potentially revealing impacts that would otherwise be overlooked; (3) the resulting framework could become a standard for responsible AI development and deployment; (4) it has potential to influence policy and governance of generative AI systems; and (5) the public toolkit could enable widespread adoption across different contexts. The approach could fundamentally shift how AI impacts are assessed, making it highly significant for the field and society."
