        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The CoEval proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on developing standardized evaluation practices for generative AI's broader impacts and emphasizes the importance of diverse stakeholder participation. The proposal incorporates key elements from the literature review, including PARTICIP-AI's democratic assessment approach (Mun et al., 2024), Solaiman et al.'s (2023) seven categories of social impact, Chouldechova et al.'s (2024) measurement theory principles, and Parthasarathy et al.'s (2024) participatory governance framework. The three-phase structure (co-design workshops, mixed-methods toolkit, and living repository) perfectly aligns with the original idea while expanding it with methodological rigor and practical implementation details."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-phase framework is logically organized and thoroughly explained, with detailed descriptions of each component. The mathematical formulations for prioritization, sampling, and evaluation add precision to the methodology. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the specific criteria for selecting the three generative AI systems for pilot testing could be more explicit, (2) the transition between phases could be more clearly delineated in terms of timeline and dependencies, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'joint displays' and 'meta-matrices' in the integrated analysis section) are used without sufficient explanation for non-specialists."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its integration of multiple methodological approaches into a cohesive framework. The combination of participatory methods with rigorous measurement theory and mixed-methods assessment represents a fresh perspective on AI evaluation. The mathematical formulations for stakeholder prioritization and sampling are innovative additions to the field. However, many of the individual components draw heavily from existing approaches (e.g., the seven impact categories from Solaiman et al., the participatory methods from Mun et al., and the measurement validation from Chouldechova et al.). While the synthesis is valuable, the proposal could push boundaries further by developing more novel metrics or evaluation techniques specifically designed for generative AI rather than adapting existing social science methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong methodological rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The three-phase approach is well-justified and incorporates established methods from participatory research, measurement theory, and mixed-methods evaluation. The mathematical formulations for prioritization, sampling, and comparative analysis add technical precision. The validation approach, including content, construct, criterion, and ecological validity assessments, follows sound scientific principles. The experimental design for framework validation is particularly well-developed, with appropriate controls and statistical analysis plans. However, there are some potential methodological concerns: (1) the proposed sample sizes may be ambitious for the qualitative components, (2) the approach to resolving potential conflicts between stakeholder groups is not fully addressed, and (3) the statistical model may not fully account for the complexity of nested and interdependent data structures in real-world evaluations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "While the proposal presents a comprehensive framework with detailed methodological components, there are significant feasibility challenges. The scope is ambitious, requiring extensive resources for implementation across three different generative AI domains. The multi-stakeholder workshops demand considerable coordination and recruitment efforts, particularly to ensure diverse representation. The proposed sample sizes (minimum 200 per stakeholder category for surveys, 15-20 interviews per category) would require substantial time and resources. The development of standardized metrics across different modalities (text, image, audio) presents technical challenges, as each domain has unique characteristics requiring specialized evaluation approaches. The proposal acknowledges the need for iterative refinement but doesn't fully address the practical challenges of maintaining and updating the living repository over time. While the modular design allows for some flexibility in implementation, the full framework as described would likely require significant resources and time to execute completely."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in the field of generative AI evaluation and has the potential for substantial impact. By developing a standardized yet flexible framework for societal impact assessment, CoEval could significantly improve how AI systems are evaluated, developed, and governed. The emphasis on inclusive participation addresses a fundamental limitation in current approaches, potentially transforming AI evaluation from an expert-centric exercise to a collaborative process that incorporates diverse perspectives. The open-source nature of the outputs would democratize access to high-quality evaluation tools, enabling broader adoption of responsible AI practices. The policy recommendations could directly inform regulatory frameworks at a time when governments worldwide are seeking guidance on AI governance. The proposal's focus on practical implementation through a living repository and knowledge-sharing platform increases its potential for real-world impact beyond academic contributions. Overall, CoEval addresses an urgent need in the field and could lead to more responsible, transparent, and socially beneficial generative AI systems."
