        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The CoEval proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the critical gap in standardized protocols for assessing broader impacts of generative AI systems highlighted in the task description. The proposal faithfully implements the three-phase framework outlined in the research idea (co-design workshops, mixed-methods toolkit, and living repository). It also incorporates key insights from the literature review, such as participatory approaches to AI evaluation (from Particip-AI and Participatory Approaches papers), standardized evaluation frameworks (from Evaluating Social Impact paper), and measurement validity (from Shared Standard paper). The proposal comprehensively covers all the topics mentioned in the task description, including sharing methodologies, developing community-built evaluations, addressing barriers to adoption, developing policy recommendations, and creating standardized evaluation frameworks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from background to methodology to expected outcomes. The three-phase framework is explained in detail, with clear objectives, methodologies, and expected outcomes for each phase. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined, providing a clear roadmap for implementation. The proposal uses concise language and avoids unnecessary jargon, making it accessible to a diverse audience. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as more specific details on how the card-sorting methods would work in practice, how stakeholders would be recruited and incentivized to participate, and how the computational metrics would be implemented. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity of the proposal is strong."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The CoEval framework offers notable originality by integrating evaluation science with participatory methods in a structured, three-phase approach. While participatory approaches to AI evaluation exist (as seen in the Particip-AI paper), CoEval's innovation lies in its comprehensive framework that spans from co-design to policy recommendations. The mixed-methods toolkit that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches is a fresh perspective, as is the emphasis on creating a living repository for evaluation protocols. However, many of the individual components (stakeholder workshops, surveys, focus groups) are established methods rather than groundbreaking innovations. The proposal builds upon existing work in the field rather than introducing entirely new concepts. The novelty lies more in the integration and application of these methods specifically to generative AI impact assessment in a standardized way, rather than in the methods themselves."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and methodological rigor. It draws appropriately from established evaluation methodologies and participatory approaches, grounding its framework in existing literature. The three-phase approach is logically structured, with each phase building upon the previous one. The mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative measures strengthens the validity of the evaluation framework. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and offers mitigation strategies, demonstrating thoughtful consideration of implementation issues. The evaluation metrics for assessing the framework itself (participation rate, stakeholder satisfaction, evaluation quality, policy adoption) are well-chosen and appropriate. The technical aspects of the computational metrics could be more thoroughly explained, but overall, the methodological approach is sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The CoEval framework presents a feasible approach to evaluating generative AI's societal impact, though it faces some implementation challenges. The three-phase structure provides a clear roadmap for implementation, and the modular design allows for adaptation to different contexts. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges (stakeholder engagement, data privacy, scalability) and offers reasonable mitigation strategies. However, coordinating diverse stakeholders across three generative AI domains (text, vision, audio) will require significant resources and coordination. The proposal would benefit from more specific details on timeline, resource requirements, and stakeholder recruitment strategies. Additionally, ensuring meaningful participation from underrepresented groups may prove challenging in practice. While these challenges are acknowledged, more concrete implementation details would strengthen the feasibility assessment. Overall, the proposal is largely implementable but will require careful planning and resource allocation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The CoEval framework addresses a critical gap in AI evaluation practices with potentially far-reaching impact. As generative AI systems become increasingly prevalent in society, standardized protocols for assessing their broader impacts are urgently needed. The proposal's emphasis on inclusive, participatory approaches could significantly enhance AI accountability and governance. By involving diverse stakeholders, including underrepresented groups, the framework could lead to more equitable AI development and deployment. The open-source nature of the toolkit and living repository promotes transparency and knowledge sharing across the AI community. The policy recommendations derived from the framework could inform regulatory approaches and industry best practices. The potential to standardize evaluation practices across different generative AI domains (text, vision, audio) further enhances its significance. Overall, the proposal addresses a pressing need in AI governance with a comprehensive, inclusive approach that could substantially impact how AI systems are evaluated and deployed."
