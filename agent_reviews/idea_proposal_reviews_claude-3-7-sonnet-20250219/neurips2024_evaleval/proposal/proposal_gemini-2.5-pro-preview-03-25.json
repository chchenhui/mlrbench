    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on standardizing evaluation practices for generative AI's broader impacts and emphasizes the importance of diverse stakeholder participation. The three-phase CoEval framework (Co-Design Workshops, Mixed-Methods Toolkit, Living Repository & Policy Templates) perfectly matches the original idea. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, including participatory approaches (Mun et al., 2024; Parthasarathy et al., 2024), standardized evaluation categories (Solaiman et al., 2023), and measurement validity principles (Chouldechova et al., 2024). The research objectives and methodology are comprehensive and directly respond to the challenges identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, research problem, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-phase CoEval framework is explained in detail, with specific examples of implementation across different generative AI domains. The research design is logically presented with a clear timeline and concrete deliverables. The technical aspects, such as the mixed-methods approach and data analysis plans, are well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as more specific details on how the computational metrics would be implemented across different domains and how potential conflicts between stakeholder perspectives would be resolved during the co-design process. Additionally, while the proposal mentions validation of the framework, it could more explicitly define success criteria for each research objective."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers significant novelty in its approach to generative AI evaluation. While participatory methods and evaluation frameworks exist separately, CoEval innovatively combines evaluation science with multi-stakeholder participation in a structured, three-phase process specifically designed for generative AI assessment. The integration of co-design workshops, mixed-methods toolkit, and a living repository represents a fresh approach to democratizing AI evaluation. The proposal's emphasis on context-specific impact criteria co-created by diverse stakeholders distinguishes it from more generic or purely expert-driven frameworks. The modular toolkit design allowing for adaptation across different generative AI domains (text, vision, audio) is particularly innovative. The proposal builds upon existing work (like Particip-AI and Solaiman's framework) but extends them significantly by creating a comprehensive, standardized methodology that bridges technical and social evaluation approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations, drawing appropriately from evaluation science, participatory action research, and mixed-methods approaches. The research design is generally well-justified, with clear connections between objectives and methodological choices. The three-phase approach is logical and builds iteratively. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened. The computational metrics section provides only a few examples and lacks detailed formulations for how these would be validated across different contexts. The proposal acknowledges the need for psychometric analysis of newly developed survey instruments but doesn't fully detail the validation process. While the mixed-methods integration is mentioned, more specific details on how qualitative and quantitative data would be synthesized to produce coherent findings would strengthen the proposal. The stakeholder selection process, while inclusive, could benefit from more systematic criteria to ensure representativeness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan but faces several implementation challenges. The 24-month timeline is ambitious given the scope of work across three different generative AI domains. Recruiting and maintaining engagement with diverse stakeholders (15-20 participants per domain) throughout multiple workshops will require significant coordination and resources. The development and validation of a modular toolkit with both qualitative and quantitative components is labor-intensive. The proposal acknowledges these challenges but could provide more contingency plans. The pilot studies involving 30-50 evaluators per domain may face practical constraints in recruitment and data collection. While the technical components (surveys, focus groups, computational metrics) are individually feasible with current technology, integrating them into a cohesive, user-friendly framework that can be widely adopted presents additional challenges. The proposal would benefit from more detailed resource allocation and risk mitigation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in AI evaluation practices with potentially far-reaching impact. By creating a standardized yet flexible framework for assessing generative AI's societal impacts, CoEval could significantly influence how AI systems are developed, evaluated, and governed. The emphasis on democratizing the evaluation process by including diverse stakeholders directly addresses power imbalances in current AI development. The expected outcomes—including an open-source toolkit, validated participatory metrics, and policy recommendations—have the potential to benefit researchers, developers, policymakers, and affected communities. The proposal aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of creating comprehensive frameworks for documenting and standardizing evaluation practices. If successful, CoEval could establish new norms for responsible AI development that balance innovation with ethical considerations and societal well-being. The living repository aspect ensures sustained impact beyond the project timeline."
