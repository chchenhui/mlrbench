        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The CoEval proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on developing standardized evaluation practices for generative AI's broader impacts and emphasizes the importance of diverse stakeholder participation. The three-phase framework (co-design workshops, mixed-methods toolkit, and living repository) perfectly matches the original idea. The proposal incorporates key insights from the literature review, specifically building on Solaiman et al.'s social impact categories, Chouldechova et al.'s measurement theory, and the participatory approaches advocated by Particip-AI and Parthasarathy et al. The methodology section clearly shows how these elements are integrated into a coherent framework that addresses the identified challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-phase approach is logically presented with detailed explanations of each component. The technical aspects, including statistical methods and formulas, are precisely defined. The proposal effectively communicates how stakeholder mapping, co-design workshops, toolkit development, and pilot deployment will be implemented. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for ensuring sustained community engagement beyond the initial workshops, (2) more specific details on how the repository will be maintained long-term, and (3) clearer explanation of how conflicts between different stakeholder priorities will be resolved during the co-design process. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity is strong."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing approaches into a comprehensive framework. Its primary innovation lies in combining participatory methods, standardized measurement theory, and community governance into a coherent process specifically for generative AI evaluation. While individual elements draw from existing work (e.g., Solaiman's impact categories, Chouldechova's measurement theory), the integration of these components with a structured co-design process and living repository represents a fresh approach. The proposal's emphasis on standardization and reproducibility across different generative domains (text, vision, audio) is also innovative. However, many of the individual methodological components (Delphi rounds, card sorting, survey instruments) are established techniques rather than novel inventions, which somewhat limits the overall novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. It is grounded in established measurement theory and statistical methods, with appropriate formulas for reliability metrics (Cronbach's α, Cohen's κ) and analysis techniques (ANOVA, t-tests). The three-phase approach is well-justified, with each component building logically on the previous one. The stakeholder mapping methodology is systematic, and the co-design process includes appropriate convergence criteria. The mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative techniques strengthens validity through triangulation. The pilot deployment across three domains with clear success metrics further enhances rigor. The proposal could be strengthened by more detailed discussion of potential confounding variables in the experimental design and more explicit validation strategies for the computational metrics, but these are relatively minor concerns in an otherwise sound methodology."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible implementation plan with realistic components. The three-phase approach breaks down the complex task into manageable steps, and the methodology uses established techniques that have proven effective in similar contexts. The stakeholder recruitment process, co-design workshops, and toolkit development all employ practical methods. The pilot deployment across three domains is ambitious but achievable with appropriate resources. However, several aspects present moderate feasibility challenges: (1) recruiting and maintaining diverse stakeholder engagement throughout the process may be difficult, (2) achieving consensus across stakeholders with potentially conflicting interests could be time-consuming, (3) developing reliable computational metrics for all three domains simultaneously is resource-intensive, and (4) the timeline for completing all three phases is not explicitly stated but appears ambitious. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do require careful planning and resource allocation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in AI governance and evaluation that has far-reaching implications. By developing a standardized, participatory framework for assessing generative AI's broader impacts, CoEval has the potential to transform how the AI community approaches responsible innovation. The significance is particularly high because: (1) it democratizes the evaluation process to include underrepresented voices, addressing power imbalances in AI governance; (2) it provides concrete tools and protocols that can be immediately adopted by researchers, companies, and policymakers; (3) it enhances reproducibility and comparability across studies through standardization; (4) it creates a living repository that can evolve with emerging technologies and societal concerns; and (5) it has potential for institutional adoption by venues like NeurIPS and funding agencies. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's goal of creating comprehensive frameworks for documenting and standardizing evaluation practices with broad participation."
