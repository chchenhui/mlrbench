    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on synergizing reasoning and decision-making in open-world environments through a hybrid architecture that integrates LLM-based reasoning with RL-driven execution. The proposal incorporates key elements from the literature review, including references to WebRL's curriculum learning, LLaMA-Rider's exploration mechanisms, and DeepSeek's reduced supervision approaches. The methodology comprehensively addresses the challenges identified in both the task description and research idea, particularly the integration of reasoning and decision-making, adaptation to unseen tasks, and minimizing human supervision. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions evaluation in AppWorld and Minecraft, it could have more explicitly connected to some of the robotics applications mentioned in the workshop topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes. The architectural components are precisely defined with mathematical formulations for the RL agent's Q-function updates and the contrastive alignment loss. The interaction protocol between the LLM, RL agent, and knowledge repository is logically presented with a step-by-step explanation. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for how the LLM reasons over failure causes using the knowledge repository could be more detailed, (2) the specific implementation of the semantic graph structure in the knowledge repository could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'InfoNCE loss') are used without brief explanations for readers unfamiliar with these concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents significant novelty in several aspects. The dynamic knowledge repository that enables bidirectional refinement between symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning represents a fresh approach to integrating these typically separate paradigms. The contrastive alignment mechanism for bridging LLM-generated subgoals with RL state representations is innovative and addresses a key challenge in hybrid systems. The proposal's approach to continuous knowledge evolution through environmental interaction differs from most existing systems that rely on static knowledge bases. While individual components like LLMs for planning and RL for execution have been explored separately, their integration through a shared, evolving knowledge structure with bidirectional updates represents a novel architectural contribution. The proposal builds upon existing work (e.g., WebRL, LLaMA-Rider) but extends these approaches in meaningful ways rather than merely combining them."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness with well-defined mathematical formulations and a coherent theoretical framework. The RL component is grounded in established principles of Q-learning and policy optimization. The contrastive learning approach for aligning LLM and RL representations is based on sound principles from representation learning. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics to evaluate the framework's performance. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in optimizing the contrastive loss across different representation spaces, (2) there's limited discussion of convergence guarantees for the joint optimization process, (3) the proposal could benefit from more detailed analysis of potential failure modes in the interaction between symbolic reasoning and RL components, and (4) while the knowledge repository is central to the approach, the formal properties of knowledge transfer and retention over time aren't thoroughly analyzed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, the individual components (LLMs, RL algorithms, contrastive learning) are established techniques with available implementations. The environments (AppWorld, Minecraft) are accessible and suitable for the proposed research. The staged training approach is practical and allows for incremental development. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) the computational resources required for training a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 65B model alongside RL agents would be substantial and potentially prohibitive for many research teams, (2) the joint optimization of LLM reasoning and RL policies presents significant engineering challenges for stable training, (3) the dynamic knowledge repository would require sophisticated data structures and retrieval mechanisms that aren't fully specified, and (4) the proposal doesn't adequately address potential challenges in aligning the vastly different representation spaces of LLMs and RL state encoders. While the overall approach is implementable, these challenges suggest significant engineering effort would be required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in AI research: the integration of symbolic reasoning with reinforcement learning for open-world environments. This work has high significance for several reasons: (1) it directly tackles the workshop's core question about unifying reasoning and decision-making, (2) the proposed framework could significantly advance autonomous agents' capabilities in complex environments requiring both abstract reasoning and concrete action execution, (3) the knowledge evolution mechanism could reduce the need for human supervision in training adaptive agents, addressing a key bottleneck in AI development, and (4) the expected outcomes would have broad applications across robotics, digital assistants, and game AI. The theoretical contributions around knowledge transfer mechanisms and abstraction hierarchies could influence future research directions in hybrid AI architectures. The proposal's focus on reducing sample complexity and enabling generalization to unseen tasks addresses critical limitations in current approaches to open-world agents."
