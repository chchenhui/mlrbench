        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on open-world agents that integrate reasoning and decision-making. It directly addresses the workshop's interest in 'synergizing reasoning and decision-making' by proposing a framework that combines LLMs (for reasoning) with RL (for decision-making). The idea tackles several key topics mentioned in the workshop description, including interleaved reasoning with decision-making, LLM tool usage, reinforcement learning in open-world environments, and knowledge acquisition. It also addresses specific questions posed in the workshop, such as how to build a model unifying reasoning and decision-making, how knowledge plays a role in these processes, and how to achieve open-world capabilities with minimal supervision."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a well-defined framework that integrates LLMs for reasoning with RL for decision-making through a dynamic knowledge graph. The proposal clearly outlines the bidirectional interface between reasoning and action, and explains how knowledge acquisition occurs. The motivation and expected outcomes are well-articulated. However, some minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific mechanisms for knowledge graph updates, the exact nature of the bidirectional interface implementation, and how the system would handle conflicting information or reasoning failures. These details would benefit from further elaboration, but the core concept is presented with sufficient clarity to understand the approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality in its approach to integrating reasoning and decision-making systems. While both LLMs and RL are established technologies, the proposed bidirectional interface and the dynamic knowledge graph as a mediating structure represent innovative combinations of existing concepts. The open-vocabulary knowledge acquisition via LLM-driven graph expansion is particularly novel. However, there have been recent works exploring LLM-RL integration and knowledge-augmented decision-making, so while this approach offers fresh perspectives and combinations, it builds upon emerging research directions rather than introducing entirely groundbreaking concepts. The novelty lies more in the specific integration architecture and knowledge update mechanisms than in the fundamental technologies employed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is somewhat feasible but faces implementation challenges. The core components (LLMs, RL algorithms, knowledge graphs) exist and are well-established, making the basic implementation possible. However, creating an effective bidirectional interface between reasoning and action systems presents significant technical challenges, particularly in ensuring that knowledge updates are coherent and that the reasoning component can effectively guide exploration in the RL framework. The open-vocabulary knowledge acquisition would require sophisticated mechanisms to maintain knowledge graph consistency. Additionally, the computational resources required for running both LLMs and RL algorithms simultaneously could be substantial. While these challenges don't make the idea impractical, they do suggest considerable engineering and research effort would be needed to realize the full vision."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in current AI systems by bridging reasoning and decision-making capabilities, which is essential for creating truly adaptive agents. If successful, this approach could significantly advance the field of open-world agents, enabling systems that can generalize across unseen challenges while leveraging both prior and newly acquired knowledge. The potential applications in robotics, game AI, and workflow automation highlight its broad impact. The significance is particularly high given the growing interest in creating more general AI systems that can operate in dynamic, open-world environments. The approach could potentially reduce the need for human intervention in knowledge updates, making autonomous systems more practical for real-world deployment. The research directly contributes to fundamental questions about how to unify reasoning and decision-making in AI systems."
