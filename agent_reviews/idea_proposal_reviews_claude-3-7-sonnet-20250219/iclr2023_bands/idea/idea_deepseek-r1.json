    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description. It directly addresses the need for cross-domain backdoor defenses, which is explicitly mentioned in the task's questions ('How can we develop a general defense method against a variety of backdoor attacks and even unseen attacks?'). The proposal spans multiple domains (CV, NLP, FL) as highlighted in the task description and aims to create a unified framework that works across these domains. The idea also addresses the task's concern about the limitations of existing defense techniques when facing diverse backdoors. The only minor point preventing a perfect score is that while the idea focuses on defense, it doesn't explicitly address some other aspects mentioned in the task like backdoor attack detection or certification methods with guarantees."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (siloed defenses), proposes a specific solution (LTSan with two well-defined phases), and outlines the expected outcomes. The methodology is well-structured with distinct components for trigger discovery and model sanitization. The technical approach is explained in sufficient detail to understand how it would work across domains. However, some technical details could be further elaborated - for instance, how exactly the contrastive learning would be implemented across different data modalities, or what specific metrics would be used to identify neurons for pruning. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its cross-domain approach to backdoor defense. While backdoor defenses exist for individual domains, the concept of a unified framework that operates in feature space regardless of input modality represents a fresh perspective. The combination of contrastive learning for trigger discovery with model sanitization techniques creates an innovative approach that differs substantially from existing domain-specific methods. The focus on latent trigger patterns rather than surface-level manifestations is particularly innovative. The approach of analyzing feature-space anomalies to identify backdoors across different domains represents a meaningful advancement over current siloed approaches."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible but faces some implementation challenges. The contrastive learning approach for identifying trigger patterns is well-established, and neuron pruning techniques have been demonstrated in prior work. However, creating a truly domain-agnostic method that works equally well across CV, NLP, and FL domains is ambitious and may encounter domain-specific challenges. The proposal assumes the ability to generate 'clean and poisoned data proxies' which might be difficult in some scenarios. The expected 20-40% improvement across all domains seems optimistic given the diversity of backdoor attacks. While the core components are implementable with current technology, significant engineering and adaptation would likely be required to achieve the stated cross-domain performance."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in ML security with potentially high impact. As noted in both the idea and task description, backdoor vulnerabilities in widely deployed pre-trained models represent a serious security concern. A unified defense framework that works across domains would significantly advance the field and provide practical protection for real-world ML systems. The cross-domain nature of the solution is particularly significant as it could protect against emerging attack vectors in less-studied domains. If successful, this work could establish new principles for backdoor defense that transcend domain-specific approaches, potentially influencing how ML security is approached more broadly. The practical implications for securing deployed models make this research highly significant."
