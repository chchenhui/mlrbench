        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the core challenge of integrating multi-modal foundation models with embodied AI agents, which is the central focus of the MFM-EAI workshop. The proposed hierarchical architecture specifically tackles the question of 'What constitutes an effective system architecture for MFM-based Embodied AI Agents?' and addresses how to balance 'high-level decision-making prowess with the nuanced requirements of low-level control.' The idea also touches on training methodology using simulators, which relates to the topic of 'Training and evaluation of MFM in open-ended scenarios.' The only minor aspect not fully addressed is the evaluation framework for such agents, though the training approach is well-covered."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The two-tiered architecture is well-defined, with clear delineation between the frozen multi-modal foundation model (top tier) and the hierarchical reinforcement learning controller (bottom tier). The roles of each component are articulated precisely - the MFM processes raw sensory data to produce semantic affordance maps and goal representations, while the HRL controller translates these into actionable subgoals and motion primitives. The training approach using self-supervised exploration in simulators is also clearly explained. The only minor ambiguities lie in the specific implementation details of how the MFM generates 'pseudo-instructions and affordances' and how exactly the transition between high-level semantic understanding and low-level control is managed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to integrating foundation models with embodied AI. While hierarchical reinforcement learning and the use of foundation models for perception are not entirely new concepts individually, their specific combination in this two-tiered architecture represents a fresh approach. The concept of using a frozen MFM to generate semantic affordance maps that guide a hierarchical controller is innovative. The self-supervised exploration mechanism where the MFM generates pseudo-instructions to bootstrap HRL training is particularly novel. However, the approach builds upon existing concepts in hierarchical RL and foundation models rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithmic innovations, which prevents it from receiving the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The use of existing foundation models (like CLIP or GPT-4V) as a frozen top tier is practical and eliminates the need for expensive retraining. The hierarchical RL approach with specialized motion primitives is well-established in robotics. The training methodology using photorealistic simulators is also feasible with current simulation technologies. However, there are moderate challenges: (1) bridging the reality gap between simulation and real-world deployment, (2) ensuring reliable generation of useful affordance maps from the MFM, and (3) coordinating the hierarchical policies effectively. These challenges are significant but not insurmountable, making the overall approach feasible with appropriate engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical challenge in embodied AI - the integration of high-level semantic understanding with low-level control. Successfully bridging this gap would represent a significant advancement in creating more capable and adaptable embodied agents. The potential applications are substantial, particularly for home assistants and general-purpose robots that must operate in unstructured environments. The approach could lead to robots with improved generalization capabilities, able to understand and manipulate novel objects based on semantic understanding rather than just geometric features. The significance is enhanced by the practical approach that leverages existing foundation models rather than requiring entirely new architectures. While not completely revolutionary, this work could substantially advance the field of embodied AI by providing a concrete, implementable framework for integrating semantic understanding with physical control."
