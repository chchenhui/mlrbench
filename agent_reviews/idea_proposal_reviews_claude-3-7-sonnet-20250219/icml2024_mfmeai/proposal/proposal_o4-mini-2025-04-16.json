    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of integrating multi-modal foundation models with embodied AI agents, which is the core focus of the task. The two-tiered architecture with a frozen MFM and hierarchical RL controller perfectly matches the proposed idea of bridging semantic understanding and low-level control. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing all four papers and addressing the key challenges identified. It specifically tackles the semantic-to-motor gap, sample efficiency, generalization, multimodal fusion, and sim-to-real transfer issues highlighted in the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the task description mentions evaluation in open-ended environments, the proposal focuses more on specific benchmarks rather than truly open-ended scenarios."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The two-tiered architecture is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The methodology section provides a comprehensive breakdown of the system architecture, problem formulation, data collection approach, and algorithmic details. The experimental design is well-defined with specific benchmarks, baselines, and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) The exact mechanism for generating pseudo-instructions from the MFM could be more detailed, (2) The relationship between the affordance maps and goal embeddings in the high-level policy could be more explicitly defined, and (3) The specific reward functions for the hierarchical RL components are not fully specified. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to integrating MFMs with hierarchical RL for embodied AI. The two-tiered architecture that combines a frozen MFM with an HRL controller is a fresh perspective that differs from existing approaches. The self-supervised pseudo-instruction generation for bootstrapping HRL subgoal discovery is particularly innovative. However, the core components build upon existing techniques: hierarchical RL (as seen in H2O2 and HIDIO from the literature review) and the use of foundation models for embodied tasks (similar to PaLM-E). The proposal effectively combines these existing approaches in a novel way rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or paradigms. The Multi-Object Fetch benchmark mentioned as 'new in this work' adds some originality to the evaluation framework. Overall, while not revolutionary, the proposal offers a fresh combination of existing concepts with some novel elements."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The problem formulation using POMDPs and hierarchical decomposition is mathematically sound and well-established in RL literature. The training methodology follows a logical progression from pretraining to fine-tuning, with appropriate loss functions and optimization techniques. The use of Transformer encoders for multimodal fusion is well-justified given their proven effectiveness in similar contexts. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. However, there are a few areas that could be strengthened: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address potential issues with the frozen MFM, such as domain gaps between the MFM's training data and embodied environments, (2) The hierarchical advantage estimators mentioned in Step 3 of the algorithmic details are not fully defined, and (3) The proposal could benefit from more discussion on potential failure modes and mitigation strategies. Despite these limitations, the overall technical approach is well-founded and rigorous."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with existing technology and methods, though it will require significant resources and expertise to implement successfully. The use of established simulators like Habitat-SIM with photorealistic scans is practical. The modular architecture allows for incremental development and testing of components. The hierarchical approach to RL is known to improve sample efficiency, making the learning process more manageable. However, several challenges may impact feasibility: (1) Training hierarchical RL systems is notoriously complex and can be unstable, (2) The sim-to-real transfer to a physical WidowX 250 robot arm will likely encounter unforeseen challenges beyond the expected 15% performance degradation, (3) Generating useful pseudo-instructions from MFMs may require significant engineering effort, and (4) The computational resources required for end-to-end training of the hierarchical system with MFM integration could be substantial. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the proposal infeasible, but rather indicate areas requiring careful attention during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in embodied AI: bridging high-level semantic understanding with low-level control. This is a fundamental challenge that, if solved effectively, would significantly advance the field of robotics and embodied AI. The expected outcomes of improved sample efficiency, enhanced generalization, and reduced sim-to-real transfer gap would be valuable contributions to the research community. The modular architecture could enable more rapid development of capable robots for real-world applications like home assistance. The approach of leveraging frozen MFMs for semantic understanding while focusing RL efforts on control policies is particularly significant as it aligns with practical deployment considerations. The proposal's impact extends beyond academic contributions to potential real-world applications in assistive robotics, warehouse automation, and other domains requiring embodied intelligence. While not completely transformative of the field, successful execution would represent a substantial step forward in creating more capable, generalizable embodied agents."
