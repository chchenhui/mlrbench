        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the MFM-EAI workshop's focus on integrating multi-modal foundation models with embodied AI agents, particularly the challenge of balancing high-level decision-making with low-level control. The proposed HiMAC architecture faithfully implements the two-tiered approach outlined in the research idea, with a frozen MFM for semantic understanding and an HRL controller for action execution. The proposal also thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing all four papers appropriately and addressing the five key challenges identified. For example, it explicitly tackles Challenge 1 (bridging semantics and control) through its hierarchical design, Challenge 2 (sample efficiency) via self-supervised bootstrapping, Challenge 3 (generalization) through MFM guidance, Challenge 4 (multimodal integration) in its sensor processing, and Challenge 5 (real-world transfer) in its experimental considerations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The architecture of HiMAC is explained in detail, with precise descriptions of each component's inputs, processing, and outputs. The mathematical formulations for the high-level and low-level policies' objectives are well-defined. The experimental design, including tasks, baselines, and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly outlined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for how the MFM-generated affordance maps are utilized by the high-level policy could be more precisely specified, (2) the training procedure for the self-supervised bootstrapping phase could be more detailed, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'option discovery') are used without full explanation. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and provides sufficient detail for implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of frozen multi-modal foundation models with hierarchical reinforcement learning for embodied agent control. While both MFMs and HRL have been explored separately (as evidenced in the literature review), their combination in the specific architecture described is innovative. The self-supervised bootstrapping approach using MFM-generated pseudo-instructions is particularly original and addresses the sample efficiency challenge in a creative way. The proposal also introduces a novel framework for utilizing semantic maps and affordance information from MFMs to guide high-level policy decisions in HRL. However, the core components (frozen MFMs, two-tier HRL) build upon existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical frameworks. The novelty lies primarily in the integration and application rather than in developing entirely new methods. The approach extends PaLM-E's work (cited as [2]) but with a more explicit hierarchical structure and reinforcement learning focus."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness in its approach. The hierarchical architecture is well-justified and builds upon established theoretical foundations in both MFM and HRL research. The mathematical formulations for policy objectives are correct and appropriate for the described learning tasks. The training methodology, including the pre-training of low-level skills followed by hierarchical integration, is technically sound and follows best practices in the field. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that will allow for meaningful assessment of the approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, such as the sim-to-real gap. However, there are a few areas where additional technical details would strengthen the soundness: (1) more specific details on how the intrinsic reward functions for low-level skills will be designed, (2) clearer specification of how the MFM outputs will be processed and encoded for the high-level policy, and (3) more discussion of potential failure modes and mitigation strategies. Overall, the technical approach is well-founded and rigorous, with only minor gaps in specification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technology and resources. The use of existing simulators (Habitat 2.0, AI2-THOR) and pre-trained foundation models makes the technical implementation realistic. The hierarchical approach to learning, with pre-training of low-level skills, helps address the sample efficiency challenge that might otherwise make the project impractical. The experimental design is reasonable and includes appropriate baselines for comparison. However, there are several aspects that present implementation challenges: (1) the integration of frozen MFMs with RL frameworks may require significant engineering effort, (2) training hierarchical policies with sparse rewards is notoriously difficult and may require more sophisticated exploration strategies than outlined, (3) the self-supervised bootstrapping approach, while innovative, may face challenges in generating useful pseudo-instructions without additional guidance, and (4) the computational resources required for training in high-fidelity 3D environments with complex physics could be substantial. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do represent significant hurdles that would need to be carefully addressed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in embodied AI: bridging the gap between high-level semantic understanding and low-level control. This problem is widely recognized as a major bottleneck in developing more capable and general-purpose robotic systems. If successful, the HiMAC framework could significantly advance the field by providing a blueprint for integrating foundation models with hierarchical control systems. The potential applications in assistive robotics, logistics, and exploration are substantial and socially valuable. The proposal also contributes to multiple important research directions simultaneously: improving sample efficiency in RL, enhancing generalization to novel tasks, and developing more effective architectures for embodied AI. The self-supervised bootstrapping approach could have broader implications for how foundation models can accelerate RL training. However, while the significance is high, the proposal is focused on a specific architectural approach rather than addressing fundamental theoretical questions about embodied intelligence or foundation models. The impact would be primarily in advancing practical implementations rather than transforming our understanding of AI capabilities."
