    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Scaling up optimization' for large language models, specifically targeting the question of 'natural model size dependent learning rates that allow extrapolation from smaller models to large ones.' The proposal incorporates spectral analysis of the Hessian matrix to derive learning rate scaling laws, which is consistent with the optimization focus of the workshop. The literature review is well-integrated, with references to recent work on hyperparameter scaling laws (Li et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2024) and builds upon these foundations. The methodology clearly outlines how the research will bridge theoretical optimization techniques with practical challenges in LLM training, which aligns with the workshop's goal of connecting classical optimization methodology with scaling challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate mathematical formulations. The spectral analysis approach is explained with sufficient technical detail, including the Hessian approximation method and the derivation of learning rate scaling laws. The experimental design outlines specific baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. The expected outcomes and broader impact are also clearly delineated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact procedure for integrating the depth-to-width ratios and attention head counts into the scaling law could be more precisely defined, and (2) the relationship between the power iteration method and the computational efficiency of the approach could be further elaborated. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible with only minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining spectral analysis of the Hessian matrix with empirical scaling laws for learning rate optimization in LLMs. While prior work (Li et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2024) has explored power-law relationships between model size and learning rates, this proposal innovates by incorporating architectural nuances and dynamic optimization landscapes through Hessian analysis. The approach of using small-scale calibration to extrapolate to larger models is not entirely new, but the specific methodology of using stochastic power iteration with mini-batch gradients to approximate the Hessian's dominant eigenvalue and derive architecture-aware learning rate schedules represents a fresh perspective. The generalized scaling law that accounts for depth, width, and attention heads is a novel contribution. However, the core idea of using Hessian eigenvalues to set learning rates is well-established in optimization literature, limiting the groundbreaking nature of the proposal."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates rigorous methodology. The theoretical foundation is based on well-established principles of optimization theory, particularly the relationship between Hessian eigenvalues and optimal learning rates. The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented, including the Hessian approximation via power iteration and the derivation of learning rate scaling laws. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines (AdamW, LAMB, Opt-Laws) and evaluation metrics that will effectively test the hypotheses. The two-phase approach (small-scale calibration followed by extrapolation) is methodologically sound and builds on empirical observations from prior work. The ablation studies are well-designed to test the robustness of the approach across different architectures and data distributions. The proposal acknowledges potential limitations and includes a mathematical appendix that provides additional technical details. The only minor weakness is that the proposal assumes a power-law relationship between eigenvalues and model size without fully justifying this assumption theoretically."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic objectives. The methodology leverages existing techniques (power iteration, regression analysis) and frameworks (PyTorch, JAX) that are well-established and accessible. The two-phase approach allows for initial validation on smaller models before scaling to larger ones, which is a practical strategy given the computational constraints of LLM training. The experimental design is comprehensive but manageable, with clear metrics for evaluation. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) computing Hessian eigenvalues for very large models can be computationally expensive, even with approximation methods; (2) the proposal aims to reduce hyperparameter tuning costs by 70%, which may be optimistic given the complexity of LLM optimization landscapes; and (3) the development of an open-source library that works seamlessly across frameworks will require significant engineering effort. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is implementable with current technology and resources, particularly if the researchers have access to sufficient computational infrastructure."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in AI development: the enormous computational and environmental costs of training LLMs. By developing systematic methods to predict optimal learning rates based on model architecture and size, the research could significantly reduce the need for expensive hyperparameter searches and improve training efficiency. The potential impact is substantial: 25-40% reduction in training time for billion-parameter models, 70% reduction in hyperparameter tuning costs, and potential savings of $10M+ annually for organizations training LLMs. These outcomes would not only accelerate AI development cycles but also mitigate environmental impacts through reduced energy consumption. The theoretical contributions would advance our understanding of optimization landscapes in deep learning, while the practical tool would have immediate applicability in both industry and academia. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on a specific aspect of optimization (learning rates) rather than addressing the full spectrum of scaling challenges, but within its scope, the potential impact is considerable."
