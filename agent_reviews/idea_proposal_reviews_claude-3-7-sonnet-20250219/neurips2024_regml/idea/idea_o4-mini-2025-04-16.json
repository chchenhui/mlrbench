        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The Policy2Constraint idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on bridging the gap between ML research and regulatory policies. It directly addresses the challenge of translating regulatory requirements (specifically GDPR and EU AI Act) into algorithmic implementations, which is a central theme of the workshop. The proposal includes evaluation frameworks for compliance, addresses multiple regulatory principles (fairness, privacy, explainability), and provides a technical solution to operationalize rights like 'the right to be forgotten' - all explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address tensions between different regulatory principles, though the framework could potentially reveal such tensions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a clear two-stage pipeline with specific components and objectives. The NLP module's function is well-defined (ingesting documents, segmenting clauses, mapping to an ontology), as is the DSL compiler's role in generating executable code. The proposal specifies concrete outputs (loss functions, auditors, tests) and evaluation metrics. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as how the ontology of ML desiderata is constructed, how the mapping between legal text and ontology is validated, and what specific techniques will be used for the dependency parsing and modal verb detection."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Policy2Constraint presents a highly innovative approach to a critical problem. While there has been work on fairness metrics, privacy-preserving ML, and explainability tools individually, the integration of these into a unified framework that automatically translates from legal text to executable constraints represents a novel contribution. The use of a domain-specific language as an intermediate representation between legal requirements and ML code is particularly innovative. The approach is not entirely without precedent - there has been work on formalizing legal requirements and on compliance checking - but the end-to-end pipeline from regulatory text to executable ML constraints, with a focus on multiple aspects of compliance simultaneously, represents a significant advancement over existing approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of Policy2Constraint faces several significant challenges. While the individual components (NLP for legal text, constraint-based ML, DSL design) are established research areas, their integration presents substantial difficulties. Legal text is notoriously ambiguous and context-dependent, making automated interpretation extremely challenging. The mapping from legal concepts to precise mathematical constraints requires domain expertise that may be difficult to encode. The evaluation plan is reasonable, but the accuracy of the translation from legal text to constraints will be difficult to measure objectively. The project would likely require a multidisciplinary team with expertise in law, NLP, and ML. While ambitious, the proposal does break down the problem into manageable components and proposes concrete case studies, suggesting it could be feasible with sufficient resources and expertise, though likely with more limited scope than initially proposed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is exceptionally high. Regulatory compliance is becoming a critical bottleneck in ML deployment across industries, with substantial legal and financial consequences for non-compliance. By automating the translation from regulatory text to executable constraints, Policy2Constraint addresses a pain point felt across academia and industry. If successful, even partially, it could dramatically accelerate compliant ML development, standardize interpretations of regulations, reduce legal risks, and enable more transparent ML systems. The focus on specific, important regulations (GDPR and EU AI Act) ensures practical relevance. The potential impact extends beyond the technical ML community to legal practitioners, policymakers, and organizations deploying ML systems, potentially influencing how future regulations are written to be more machine-interpretable."
