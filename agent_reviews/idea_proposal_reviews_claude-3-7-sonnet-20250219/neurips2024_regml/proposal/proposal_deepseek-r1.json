    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging gaps between ML research and regulatory principles, particularly the tensions between fairness, privacy, and explainability. The methodology section thoroughly develops the causal framework outlined in the research idea, incorporating causal graphs, multi-objective adversarial training, and regulatory stress-testing. The proposal also builds upon the literature review effectively, citing works like Binkyte et al. (2025) and Ji et al. (2023) to establish the foundation for using causality to address regulatory trade-offs. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions challenges related to foundation models and AGI risks, the proposal doesn't explicitly address these aspects."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is presented with appropriate mathematical formulations that enhance understanding of the causal disentanglement framework and multi-objective adversarial training. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context, and the methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the proposed techniques. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact implementation details of the adaptive tuning for Lagrangian multipliers, (2) more specific details on how the causal discovery algorithms will be applied in practice, and (3) clearer visualization or description of the GAN-inspired architecture mentioned in Figure 1 (which isn't actually included in the provided text)."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to addressing regulatory compliance in ML through causal disentanglement. While individual components like adversarial training for fairness or causal modeling have been explored separately, the integration of these techniques to jointly optimize for fairness, privacy, and explainability represents a significant innovation. The multi-objective adversarial architecture with three specialized discriminators is particularly original. The proposal also introduces the concept of a 'regulatory stress-test benchmark,' which appears to be a new contribution to the field. The work builds upon existing literature but extends it in meaningful ways by providing a unified framework rather than addressing regulatory principles in isolation. However, some individual components (like adversarial debiasing) are adaptations of existing techniques rather than completely new methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations in causal inference and adversarial learning. The mathematical formulations for the structural causal models and the multi-objective adversarial training are technically sound and well-presented. The evaluation metrics chosen for each regulatory principle are appropriate and comprehensive. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in causal discovery with limited data, (2) there's limited discussion of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, (3) the interaction between the three adversarial components might lead to training instabilities that aren't addressed, and (4) the proposal could benefit from more detailed theoretical analysis of the trade-offs between the different regulatory objectives. While the overall approach is well-founded, these gaps slightly reduce the soundness score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a technically ambitious project with several implementation challenges. While the individual components (causal modeling, adversarial training, benchmark creation) are feasible with current technology, their integration into a unified framework poses significant challenges. The multi-objective adversarial training with three discriminators may face convergence issues and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. Causal discovery in real-world datasets with potential hidden confounders is notoriously difficult. The creation of a comprehensive benchmark across multiple domains (healthcare, finance, criminal justice) would require substantial resources and domain expertise. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but doesn't provide detailed mitigation strategies. Given these considerations, the feasibility is moderate - the research is implementable but will likely require significant refinement and may not achieve all stated objectives within a standard research timeframe."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current ML research: the harmonization of multiple regulatory principles that are typically treated in isolation. This work has significant potential impact across several dimensions: (1) Policy compliance - providing tools for ML practitioners to meet complex regulatory requirements like GDPR; (2) Theoretical advancement - formalizing regulatory alignment as a causal inference problem; (3) Practical applications - enabling deployment of compliant models in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance; and (4) Benchmark contribution - creating evaluation protocols that could become standard for regulatory testing. The work directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging research-regulation gaps and could influence both technical approaches to regulatory compliance and policy development. The significance is particularly high given increasing regulatory scrutiny of ML systems worldwide and the current lack of unified frameworks for addressing multiple regulatory principles simultaneously."
