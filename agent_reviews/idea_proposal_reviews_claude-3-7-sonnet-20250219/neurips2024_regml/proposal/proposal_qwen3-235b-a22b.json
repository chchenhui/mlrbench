    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging gaps between ML research and regulatory principles, particularly in operationalizing fairness, privacy, and explainability requirements. The methodology follows through on the main idea of using causal disentanglement to harmonize regulatory principles, with detailed explanations of the causal graph modeling, multi-objective adversarial training, and regulatory stress-testing components. The proposal effectively incorporates cited literature, building upon works like Binkyte et al. (2025) for causal approaches to trustworthy ML, Lahoti et al. (2020) for adversarial fairness methods, and Ji et al. (2023) for causality-aided trade-off analysis. The only minor inconsistency is that some referenced papers (e.g., Hardt et al., 2016; Chiappa & Gillam, 2018) appear in the methodology but are not included in the final references section."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the technical approach, including mathematical formulations for the causal disentanglement framework and multi-objective adversarial training. The evaluation metrics and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. The use of subsections, bullet points, and tables enhances readability. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for balancing the multi-objective loss function could be more precisely defined beyond Pareto-frontier analysis, (2) the explanation of the explainability discriminator (D_E) and its loss function is somewhat abstract and could benefit from more concrete examples, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., PC algorithm, SHAP) are used without sufficient introduction for readers unfamiliar with these concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to unifying fairness, privacy, and explainability through causal disentanglement. While individual components draw from existing work (e.g., adversarial fairness, causal modeling), the integration of these elements into a cohesive framework represents a fresh perspective. The partitioning of latent representations into sensitive-dependent and sensitive-independent components for multi-objective optimization is innovative. The regulatory stress-test benchmark also offers a novel contribution to the field. However, the proposal shares similarities with existing approaches in causal fairness and adversarial learning, and the mathematical formulations build incrementally on established techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methods. The novelty lies more in the integration and application to regulatory compliance than in the development of entirely new algorithmic approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The causal framework is well-grounded in established causal inference methods, and the mathematical formulations for the disentanglement and adversarial training components are technically sound. The evaluation metrics are appropriate for measuring the relevant regulatory principles (fairness, privacy, explainability). The proposal acknowledges potential challenges, such as identifiability issues in causal graph learning, and proposes reasonable solutions (e.g., incorporating domain knowledge priors). The statistical analysis plan using Bayesian optimization and ANOVA is methodologically appropriate. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) more detailed discussion of the theoretical guarantees for the proposed disentanglement approach, (2) clearer justification for the specific form of the privacy loss function and its relationship to differential privacy, and (3) more thorough consideration of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan, though it faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the methodology builds on established techniques in causal inference, adversarial learning, and explainable AI, and the data sources (synthetic data, MIMIC-III, German Credit Dataset) are accessible. The evaluation metrics are well-defined and measurable. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) inferring accurate causal graphs from observational data is notoriously difficult, especially with complex real-world datasets; (2) balancing multiple adversarial objectives simultaneously is computationally challenging and may lead to training instabilities; (3) the proposal requires expertise across multiple domains (causality, fairness, privacy, explainability) which may be difficult to coordinate; (4) the regulatory stress-test benchmark requires extensive annotation and ground-truth causal dependencies which may be time-consuming to develop properly. While the individual components are feasible, their integration into a unified framework as described presents considerable implementation challenges that may require significant resources and methodological refinements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the field of responsible AI and regulatory compliance. The potential impact is substantial, as successful implementation could significantly advance the operationalization of regulatory principles in ML systems. The work directly addresses the growing gap between regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, AI Act) and technical implementations, which is a pressing concern for both researchers and practitioners. The proposed framework could enable more principled deployment of ML in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance, where regulatory compliance is essential. The open-source tools for auditing trade-offs would provide practical value to the community. The insights into causal structures governing regulatory harmony could inform future policy development. While the immediate impact might be limited to specific application domains and regulatory frameworks, the conceptual approach of using causal disentanglement to harmonize competing objectives has broader implications for trustworthy AI research. The significance is somewhat tempered by the implementation challenges noted in the feasibility assessment, but the potential benefits justify the research investment."
