    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the gap between ML research and regulatory policies highlighted in the workshop description by proposing a unified framework for fairness, privacy, and explainability. The causal disentanglement approach follows the exact structure outlined in the research idea, incorporating causal graphs, multi-objective adversarial training, and a regulatory stress-test benchmark. The proposal also effectively integrates the cited literature, particularly building upon Binkyte et al.'s work on causality for balancing multiple goals in trustworthy ML, Ji et al.'s causality-aided trade-off analysis, Lahoti et al.'s adversarial reweighting approach, and Grabowicz et al.'s work on formalizing discrimination as causal effects. The proposal maintains consistency throughout its methodology, expected outcomes, and impact sections, all of which align with the workshop's focus on bridging gaps between ML research and regulatory principles."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology is presented in a detailed, step-by-step manner with three distinct phases that build upon each other. Mathematical formulations are provided where appropriate, enhancing precision. The causal graph modeling, multi-objective adversarial training, and evaluation framework are all explained thoroughly. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for balancing the multiple adversarial objectives during training could be more precisely defined, (2) some technical details about the explainability regularizer remain somewhat abstract, and (3) the proposal could more explicitly address how the framework would handle scenarios where causal assumptions might be incorrect or contested. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity is strong, making the research approach and expected outcomes readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers significant novelty in several aspects. First, while existing work has applied causal reasoning to individual regulatory principles (as seen in the literature review), the integration of causality to jointly model and optimize for fairness, privacy, and explainability represents a novel contribution. The multi-objective adversarial training framework guided by causal insights is particularly innovative, as it provides a principled approach to harmonizing potentially conflicting regulatory requirements. The proposed regulatory stress-test benchmark also represents a novel contribution to the field, as comprehensive evaluation frameworks for multi-faceted regulatory compliance are currently lacking. The proposal builds upon existing work in a non-trivial way, extending concepts from papers like Binkyte et al. (2025) and Grabowicz et al. (2022) into a unified framework. While individual components (causal modeling, adversarial training) have precedents in the literature, their integration and application to the specific problem of regulatory harmony is original and potentially impactful."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness overall. The causal modeling approach is well-grounded in established causal inference principles, including Pearl's do-calculus and counterfactual reasoning. The multi-objective adversarial training framework builds on solid foundations in adversarial learning and multi-objective optimization. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, with appropriate metrics for each regulatory dimension. However, there are some limitations to the soundness: (1) The proposal assumes that accurate causal graphs can be constructed, but causal discovery from observational data remains challenging and often requires strong assumptions; (2) The adversarial training approach might face stability issues that are acknowledged but not fully addressed; (3) Some of the proposed explainability metrics (like 'feature importance consistency') may be difficult to validate without ground truth causal effects. The proposal would benefit from more discussion of potential failure modes and mitigation strategies. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is technically sound and builds appropriately on established methods in causal inference and adversarial learning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan with some significant challenges. On the positive side, the research leverages existing tools and frameworks (PyTorch, DoWhy, AIF360, etc.), and the evaluation on standard benchmark datasets is practical. The phased approach allows for incremental progress. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Accurate causal graph discovery from observational data is notoriously difficult, especially for complex real-world datasets with potential unobserved confounders; (2) The multi-objective adversarial training with three competing objectives (task performance, fairness, privacy) may face optimization difficulties, including potential instability and convergence issues; (3) The computational resources required for the proposed approach could be substantial, especially when scaling to larger datasets; (4) Some datasets mentioned (like MIMIC-III) have significant access restrictions that could impede research progress; (5) The proposal aims to address three complex areas simultaneously (fairness, privacy, explainability), each of which presents its own challenges. While the research direction is promising, these practical implementation challenges suggest that the full scope of the proposal might be difficult to achieve within a standard research timeframe, and some narrowing of focus might be necessary."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current ML research with high potential significance. The problem of harmonizing multiple regulatory requirements is increasingly important as ML systems face stricter regulatory scrutiny in high-stakes domains. The proposed framework could have substantial impact in several ways: (1) Scientific impact: It advances the theoretical understanding of how fairness, privacy, and explainability interact through a causal lens, potentially establishing a new paradigm for thinking about regulatory compliance holistically; (2) Practical impact: It offers concrete tools and methodologies for developers to build ML systems that satisfy multiple regulatory requirements simultaneously, which is a pressing need in regulated industries; (3) Societal impact: By enabling more comprehensively trustworthy ML systems, the research could help prevent algorithmic harms while maintaining the benefits of ML applications in critical domains. The regulatory stress-test benchmark alone would be a significant contribution, providing a standardized way to evaluate and compare models on multiple regulatory dimensions. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging gaps between ML research and regulatory principles, with potential to influence both technical practice and policy discussions around AI governance."
