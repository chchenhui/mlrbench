    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the identified gap in 'robust video-language alignment benchmarks' mentioned in the workshop description. The proposal's focus on fine-grained temporal alignment between textual phrases and video segments is consistent with the research idea of creating FineActionBench. The methodology incorporates insights from the literature review, building upon works like TemporalBench, VideoComp, and FIBER while addressing their limitations in phrase-to-segment grounding. The proposal acknowledges existing datasets (FineAction, FIBER) and models (Grounded-VideoLLM, PiTe, VidLA) mentioned in the literature review and positions itself as addressing an unmet need in the field."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides detailed information about data collection, annotation processes, benchmark structure, evaluation metrics, and experimental design. The mathematical formulations for metrics and algorithmic frameworks are precisely defined. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly delineated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact relationship between the proposed benchmark and existing datasets like FineAction and FIBER could be more explicitly defined, (2) the process for ensuring diversity in the video content could be elaborated, and (3) the validation process for ensuring the quality of annotations could include more details about training annotators and resolving disagreements."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its focus on fine-grained temporal alignment between textual phrases and video segments. While existing benchmarks like TemporalBench and VideoComp address aspects of temporal understanding, FineActionBench specifically targets phrase-to-segment grounding at a millisecond level, which represents a novel contribution. The proposed evaluation metrics, particularly the Phrase-Localized Temporal IoU and Hierarchical Accuracy, offer fresh perspectives on assessing temporal grounding precision. However, the core methodological approach builds significantly on existing frameworks like PiTe's pixel-temporal alignment, and the data collection strategy follows established practices in the field. The proposal is innovative in its application and focus rather than introducing fundamentally new technical approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates rigorous methodology. The data collection and annotation processes are well-designed with appropriate validation measures (Fleiss' κ ≥ 0.8). The evaluation metrics are mathematically well-defined and appropriate for the task. The experimental design includes baseline models, ablation studies, and cross-dataset validation, which are essential for comprehensive evaluation. The algorithmic framework for baselines is grounded in established techniques from the literature. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges in temporal modeling, such as co-occurring actions and long-term dependencies. The only minor concerns are: (1) the proposal could provide more details on how to handle edge cases in annotation (e.g., ambiguous action boundaries), and (2) the justification for the specific loss function weights (λ1, λ2) in the temporal localization component could be strengthened."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, though with some moderate challenges. The target of 5,000 videos with dense temporal annotations is ambitious but achievable, especially since the proposal plans to leverage existing datasets (FineAction, FIBER) alongside new collections. The annotation process requiring expert annotators to provide precise temporal segmentation is resource-intensive but manageable with proper planning. The evaluation of baseline models using official implementations is straightforward. The cross-dataset validation adds complexity but enhances the benchmark's value. The main feasibility concerns are: (1) ensuring consistent high-quality annotations across 5,000 videos with multiple annotators, (2) the computational resources required for evaluating multiple state-of-the-art models on large video datasets, and (3) the challenge of defining universally accepted standards for what constitutes an 'atomic action' across diverse activities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant gap in video-language research and has clear potential for impact. Fine-grained temporal alignment is crucial for applications like instructional video analysis, robotic action sequencing, and precise video search. The benchmark would provide the research community with a standardized tool for evaluating and comparing model performance on temporal grounding precision, potentially accelerating progress in the field. The expected finding that even state-of-the-art models achieve <50% Action-Level accuracy would highlight important deficiencies in current approaches and motivate new research directions. The proposed data augmentation strategy could lead to meaningful improvements in model accuracy. The benchmark's focus on compositional phrases and overlapping actions addresses real-world complexities that are often overlooked in existing evaluations. While the impact is primarily within the video-language research community, the potential applications span multiple domains including robotics, surveillance, and content creation."
