    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on video-language models and specifically targets the fourth challenge mentioned in the task description: 'the community still lacks robust video-language alignment benchmarks.' The proposal builds upon the FineAction dataset (2021) mentioned in the literature review and incorporates methodologies from recent works like VidLA (2024), VideoComp (2025), and Grounded-VideoLLM (2024). The benchmark design with phrase-level temporal alignment and novel metrics like phrase-localized T-IoU addresses the fine-grained temporal understanding gap identified in the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions expanding FineAction with 5K new videos, it doesn't fully elaborate on how this expansion addresses diversity concerns across demographics mentioned in the ethical considerations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and future directions. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the benchmark design is thoroughly explained with formal definitions of tasks and evaluation metrics. The mathematical formulations for T-IoU and its weighted variant are precisely defined. The data collection, annotation protocol, and experimental design are all described in detail. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact relationship between the existing FineAction dataset and the proposed FineActionBench could be more explicitly defined, (2) the training protocol mentions PiTe-143k for initialization but doesn't fully explain how this dataset will be integrated, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the baseline models could be more specific, particularly regarding the adaptation of VidLA's architecture."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in several aspects. The focus on fine-grained temporal alignment with phrase-level annotations addresses a gap in existing benchmarks like TemporalBench and E.T. Bench, which focus more on open-ended tasks. The introduction of phrase-localized T-IoU and its weighted variant (T-IoU_w) represents a novel contribution to evaluation metrics. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing work rather than introducing entirely new concepts. It leverages the FineAction dataset (2021), adapts architectures from VidLA (2024), and incorporates methodologies from VideoComp (2025) and Grounded-VideoLLM (2024). While the combination and application of these elements to create a comprehensive benchmark for fine-grained temporal alignment is valuable, the core components are extensions of existing approaches rather than groundbreaking innovations."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The benchmark design is well-grounded in established practices for dataset creation, with clear annotation protocols and quality control measures. The evaluation metrics, particularly the phrase-localized T-IoU, are mathematically well-defined and appropriate for the task. The experimental design includes multiple baseline models, a clear training protocol, and thoughtful ablation studies to assess different aspects of the benchmark. The proposal also acknowledges potential biases and includes strategies to control for them, such as stratifying across activity types. The only minor weaknesses are: (1) the justification for the specific T-IoU thresholds (0.3-0.7) could be more thoroughly explained, (2) the expected performance gap between SOTA models (40% mAP@0.5) and humans (85%) is stated without detailed justification, and (3) the proposal could benefit from more discussion of statistical significance testing for the evaluation results."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. Building upon the existing FineAction dataset provides a solid foundation, and the annotation protocol with three experts and validation via Amazon Mechanical Turk is practical. The baseline models leverage established architectures, making implementation straightforward. However, there are several challenges that affect feasibility: (1) obtaining high-quality annotations for 22K videos with ≥200K phrase-segment pairs will require significant resources and time, (2) ensuring inter-annotator agreement (κ ≥ 0.7) for subjective temporal boundaries may be difficult, (3) the computational resources needed to train and evaluate multiple baseline models on this large dataset could be substantial, and (4) the proposal mentions obtaining copyright licenses for videos, which could be a complex legal process depending on the sources. While these challenges don't make the project impossible, they do represent significant hurdles that would require careful planning and resource allocation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in video-language understanding that has substantial implications for both research and applications. From a research perspective, FineActionBench would provide a standardized way to evaluate and compare models on fine-grained temporal alignment, potentially driving advances in multimodal integration and temporal modeling. The benchmark would complement existing resources like TemporalBench and E.T. Bench by focusing specifically on phrase-level temporal grounding. The application impact spans multiple domains, including robotics, accessibility tools, and surveillance, where precise temporal alignment is crucial. The proposal also outlines clear future directions that could further enhance its impact, such as cross-lingual extensions and 3D temporal modeling. The only limitation to its significance is that while it addresses an important problem, it focuses on a specific aspect of video-language understanding rather than transforming the entire field."
