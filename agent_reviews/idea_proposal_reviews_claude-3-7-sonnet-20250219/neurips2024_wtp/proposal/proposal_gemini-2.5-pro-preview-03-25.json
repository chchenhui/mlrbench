    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on the scarcity of high-quality video data by proposing a densely annotated benchmark. It tackles the challenge of processing video data by focusing on temporal precision in understanding. The multimodal integration aspect is addressed through the evaluation of models that must align textual phrases with precise video segments. Most importantly, it directly responds to the workshop's identified need for 'robust video-language alignment benchmarks' by creating FineActionBench. The proposal builds upon the literature review effectively, citing relevant works like TemporalBench, VideoComp, PiTe, and FIBER while identifying the specific gap in fine-grained temporal grounding that FineActionBench aims to fill. The methodology is consistent with the research idea of creating a benchmark for evaluating fine-grained temporal alignment capabilities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and impact. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The task definition and evaluation metrics are formally defined with mathematical notation where appropriate. The annotation protocol is detailed with specific guidelines. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The distinction between FineActionBench and existing benchmarks like FIBER could be more explicitly delineated, (2) The implementation details for baseline models could be more specific about adaptation strategies for models not originally designed for temporal grounding, and (3) The proposal could more clearly specify the computational resources required for the annotation process and baseline evaluations. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity is strong, with well-defined concepts, methodologies, and expected outcomes."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty in its focus on fine-grained temporal grounding at the phrase level. While several existing benchmarks address aspects of temporal understanding (as noted in the literature review), FineActionBench differentiates itself by specifically targeting the alignment of short textual phrases with precise temporal segments in complex videos. The proposed Phrase-Localized T-IoU (PL-T-IoU) metric represents an incremental but useful innovation on existing temporal IoU metrics. The proposal's novelty is somewhat limited by its methodological approach, which largely adapts existing annotation and evaluation frameworks rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques. The core contribution is in the specific combination of dense phrase-level annotations with precise temporal boundaries and the creation of a standardized evaluation framework, rather than in proposing novel technical methods for temporal grounding itself."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness in its approach. The evaluation metrics are well-defined mathematically, particularly the T-IoU and its adaptation to phrase-level evaluation (PL-T-IoU). The annotation protocol is rigorous, with attention to quality control through multiple annotators and inter-annotator agreement measures. The baseline evaluation methodology is comprehensive, including both zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios. The proposal is grounded in established literature, citing relevant works and building upon existing datasets like FineAction and HowTo100M. The task definition is formally specified with clear input-output relationships. The only minor limitations in soundness are: (1) The proposal could provide more details on statistical validation of the annotation quality beyond inter-annotator agreement, and (2) There could be more discussion of potential biases in the annotation process and how they might be mitigated. Overall, the technical foundations are solid and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, but with some notable challenges. On the positive side, it leverages existing video datasets as a starting point, which reduces the need to collect new video data. The annotation protocol is well-defined and realistic. The evaluation metrics build on established approaches in the field. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The dense annotation process (5-15 annotations per video minute) for 1,000-1,500 videos would require significant human resources and quality control, potentially making the timeline challenging; (2) The proposal doesn't specify the budget or team size needed for this annotation effort; (3) Adapting existing models for the temporal grounding task may be more complex than indicated, especially for models not designed with this capability in mind; (4) The computational resources required for fine-tuning large video-language models on the proposed dataset could be substantial. While these challenges don't make the project infeasible, they do represent significant practical hurdles that would need careful management."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant gap in the evaluation of video-language models. Fine-grained temporal grounding is indeed crucial for many real-world applications including robotics, detailed video analysis, and human-computer interaction. The benchmark would provide a valuable tool for the research community to measure progress in this specific capability. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's comprehensive approach, including dataset creation, metric definition, baseline evaluation, and public release. The work directly addresses the workshop's highlighted need for better evaluation benchmarks. The potential impact extends beyond academic research to practical applications requiring precise temporal understanding. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on a specific aspect of video understanding (temporal grounding) rather than addressing the full spectrum of video-language challenges, but within its scope, the significance is high. The benchmark could drive meaningful progress in improving the temporal precision of video-language models."
