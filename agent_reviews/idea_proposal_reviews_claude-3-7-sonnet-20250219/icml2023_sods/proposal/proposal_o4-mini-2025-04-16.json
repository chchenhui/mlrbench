    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of discrete space sampling/optimization with black-box objectives, which is a central focus of the task description. The proposal implements the exact idea of coupling a GNN surrogate with a GFlowNet sampler to reduce query complexity while maintaining sample quality. The methodology section thoroughly elaborates on the active learning framework outlined in the research idea. The proposal also builds upon the GFlowNet literature cited in the review, extending it to handle black-box objectives through surrogate modeling. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review emphasizes various GFlowNet applications, the proposal could have more explicitly discussed how it builds upon or differs from specific prior GFlowNet variants mentioned in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from problem formulation to methodology to evaluation. The technical formulations are precise and well-defined, with clear mathematical notation for the surrogate model, GFlowNet objective, and active learning procedure. The GÂ²Flow algorithm is presented step-by-step with explicit inputs, operations, and termination conditions. The experimental design section comprehensively outlines benchmarks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The only areas that could benefit from additional clarity are: (1) more detailed explanation of how the surrogate uncertainty is incorporated into the GFlowNet training process beyond the acquisition step, and (2) further elaboration on the importance weighting mechanism for reward recalibration and its theoretical justification."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of surrogate modeling with GFlowNets in an active learning framework specifically designed for black-box discrete sampling. While both GFlowNets and surrogate models exist separately, their combination in this iterative, uncertainty-aware manner represents a significant innovation. The use of GNN-based surrogates to provide pseudo-gradients for discrete spaces is particularly innovative. The proposal's active learning acquisition strategy that balances uncertainty and reward potential is also novel in the GFlowNet context. The importance-weighted correction mechanism for surrogate bias is another original contribution. However, the core components (GFlowNets, GNNs, active learning) are established techniques, and similar surrogate-based approaches have been explored in other sampling contexts, which prevents the proposal from receiving the highest novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The GFlowNet formulation follows established principles, and the surrogate model design is well-justified. The active learning loop has a clear mathematical foundation with appropriate uncertainty quantification through ensemble variance. However, there are some areas where theoretical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the proposal lacks formal convergence guarantees for the combined surrogate-GFlowNet system, (2) the importance weighting scheme for reward recalibration is presented without detailed theoretical analysis of its impact on the trajectory balance objective, and (3) the proposal does not thoroughly address potential issues with surrogate model bias affecting the GFlowNet's convergence properties. While the methodology is generally well-founded, these theoretical gaps prevent it from receiving the highest soundness score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined components that can be implemented with existing technologies and methods. The GNN surrogate model, GFlowNet sampler, and active learning loop are all implementable with current deep learning frameworks. The experimental design includes realistic benchmarks and evaluation metrics. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) training multiple GNN ensemble members and retraining them frequently could be computationally expensive, (2) the proposal requires careful hyperparameter tuning for the acquisition strategy balance between uncertainty and reward, which might be challenging in practice, (3) the approach assumes that the surrogate can reasonably approximate the true objective with limited data, which may not hold for extremely complex black-box functions, and (4) the wall-clock efficiency of the method depends on the relative costs of surrogate inference versus true objective evaluation, which varies by application. These practical challenges reduce the feasibility score somewhat."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in machine learning and scientific computing: efficient sampling and optimization in discrete spaces with expensive black-box objectives. If successful, this work could have substantial impact across multiple domains. The potential to reduce oracle queries by an order of magnitude would enable previously infeasible applications in protein design, language model conditioning, and combinatorial optimization. The proposal identifies concrete applications in constrained text generation, molecular engineering, and hardware/compiler design that would benefit significantly. The framework also establishes a new paradigm that bridges surrogate modeling and generative flow networks, potentially inspiring further research at this intersection. The significance is particularly high given the growing importance of discrete sampling problems in modern AI systems and scientific discovery. The only limitation preventing a perfect score is that some applications might require even greater query efficiency than what's likely achievable with this approach."
