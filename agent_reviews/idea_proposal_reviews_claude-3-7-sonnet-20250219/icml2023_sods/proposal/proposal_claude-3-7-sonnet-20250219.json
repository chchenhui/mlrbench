    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of discrete space sampling/optimization with black-box objectives that have long-range, high-order correlations, which is highlighted in the task description as a key limitation of current methods. The proposal implements the exact approach outlined in the research idea: coupling a GNN surrogate with a GFlowNet sampler in an iterative framework with active learning. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, building upon recent GFlowNet applications in various domains while addressing the identified challenge of sample efficiency in black-box settings. The proposal extends beyond existing work by introducing the surrogate-guided approach specifically designed for expensive black-box evaluations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem formulation to methodology and expected outcomes. The technical details are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the approach understandable to those familiar with the field. The methodology section is particularly strong, with clear explanations of the GNN surrogate model, GFlowNet formulation, and the iterative framework that connects them. The active learning strategy and surrogate calibration mechanisms are well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of the GNN architecture could be more specific, (2) the transition between surrogate predictions and GFlowNet rewards could be explained more explicitly, and (3) some of the mathematical notation in the active learning section could be better connected to the overall framework."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel combination of techniques that addresses an important gap in the literature. While GFlowNets and graph neural networks have been studied separately, their integration in an iterative surrogate-assisted framework for black-box discrete sampling is innovative. The active learning strategy with the composite acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation is a creative approach to the sample efficiency problem. The surrogate calibration mechanism to address potential biases is also a thoughtful addition not commonly seen in related work. The proposal builds upon existing GFlowNet literature (as evidenced in the review) but extends it in a meaningful direction by focusing on the black-box setting with expensive evaluations. While individual components (GNNs, GFlowNets, active learning) are established, their specific combination and application to this problem domain represents a significant advancement rather than an incremental improvement."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The GFlowNet formulation follows established principles, and the GNN surrogate approach is well-justified. The mathematical formulations are mostly correct and clearly presented. The iterative framework logically connects the different components, and the active learning strategy is grounded in information-theoretic principles. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the convergence properties of the iterative framework are not analyzed, (2) the impact of surrogate model errors on the GFlowNet's sampling distribution could be more rigorously addressed, and (3) the calibration mechanism, while intuitive, lacks formal guarantees. Additionally, the proposal could benefit from a more detailed error analysis to understand how approximation errors propagate through the system. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and the methodology is well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation requirements. The individual components (GNNs, GFlowNets, active learning) have established implementations, and the integration, while novel, follows a clear methodology. The experimental design covers appropriate test domains and includes relevant baselines for comparison. However, there are several practical challenges that may affect implementation: (1) training both a GNN surrogate and a GFlowNet is computationally intensive, potentially limiting scalability to very large discrete spaces, (2) the active learning component requires careful tuning of hyperparameters like λ and β, which could significantly impact performance, (3) the calibration mechanism may struggle with highly non-linear relationships between surrogate predictions and true values. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but could provide more specific strategies to address them. Overall, the approach is implementable with current technology and methods, though it may require considerable computational resources and careful engineering to achieve the expected performance gains."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in machine learning: efficient sampling and optimization in discrete spaces with expensive black-box objectives. This problem appears in numerous high-impact domains including molecular design, protein engineering, and language model optimization. The potential impact is substantial, as even modest improvements in sample efficiency could translate to significant cost savings and accelerated discovery in these fields. The approach is particularly significant because it targets the specific limitations of current methods when dealing with long-range, high-order correlations in black-box settings. If successful, this research could enable new applications that are currently computationally infeasible and establish a new paradigm for discrete sampling and optimization. The expected outcomes section clearly articulates both the methodological contributions and the practical impact across multiple domains. The broader implications for scientific discovery and AI research further underscore the significance of this work."
