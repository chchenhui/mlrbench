    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenges of discrete space sampling and optimization, particularly focusing on black-box objectives with complex correlations as highlighted in the task description. The proposed Graph Neural Surrogate-Guided GFlowNets (GNS-GFN) framework faithfully implements the core idea of coupling a GNN surrogate with a GFlowNet sampler, using active learning for efficient exploration. The proposal thoroughly incorporates the literature on GFlowNets, citing and building upon the relevant works mentioned in the literature review, including applications in combinatorial optimization, molecular design, and latent variable modeling. The methodology section clearly outlines how the framework addresses the key challenges identified in both the task description and literature review, such as handling black-box objectives and capturing long-range, high-order correlations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, research gap, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with mathematical formulations and algorithmic steps that are easy to follow. The overall framework is presented in a logical sequence with clear connections between components. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying tasks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for recalibrating the GFlowNet using true evaluations could be more precisely defined, (2) some technical details about the GNN architecture choices could be more specific, and (3) the proposal occasionally uses technical terminology without full explanation, which might make some sections less accessible to readers unfamiliar with GFlowNets or surrogate modeling."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of three key components: GFlowNets for discrete sampling, GNNs as surrogate models, and active learning for efficient exploration. While each individual component exists in prior work, their combination into a closed-loop system specifically designed for black-box discrete sampling is innovative. The approach of using a GNN surrogate to guide a GFlowNet, with periodic recalibration based on true evaluations, represents a fresh perspective on addressing sample efficiency in black-box optimization. The proposal also introduces novel elements such as the effective reward formulation that combines surrogate predictions with known true values, and the integration of uncertainty estimation within the GFlowNet sampling process. The application domains (molecule optimization, conditional text generation) extend beyond the typical use cases seen in the literature review. However, the core techniques (GNNs, GFlowNets, active learning) are established methods, and some aspects of the integration draw from existing work in surrogate-based optimization."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-founded and builds on established theoretical frameworks. The mathematical formulations for the GNN surrogate, GFlowNet training, and active learning components are technically correct and follow standard practices in the field. The integration of these components is logically justified, with clear reasoning for how they complement each other. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that would effectively validate the approach. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the proposal lacks formal theoretical analysis of convergence properties or sample complexity guarantees, (2) potential issues with surrogate model bias and its impact on GFlowNet training are acknowledged but not thoroughly analyzed, (3) the approach for handling uncertainty in the surrogate predictions could benefit from more rigorous justification, and (4) some claims about performance improvements are made without sufficient theoretical backing. While the overall approach is sound, these gaps in theoretical analysis slightly reduce the score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed GNS-GFN framework is generally feasible with current technology and methods. All the core components (GNNs, GFlowNets, active learning) have existing implementations that could be adapted for this purpose. The tasks selected for evaluation (combinatorial optimization, molecule generation, conditional text generation) are reasonable and have established benchmarks. The computational requirements, while substantial, are within the capabilities of modern research computing infrastructure. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) training GFlowNets is known to be unstable and may require careful hyperparameter tuning, (2) the iterative nature of the framework with multiple training loops could lead to significant computational overhead, (3) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the challenge of designing effective graph representations for sequential data like text, and (4) the active learning component might face practical issues with batch selection in high-dimensional discrete spaces. These challenges don't make the proposal infeasible, but they do represent significant hurdles that would need to be overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in machine learning and scientific discovery: efficient sampling and optimization in discrete spaces with expensive black-box objectives. If successful, the GNS-GFN framework could have substantial impact across multiple domains. In scientific discovery (drug design, materials science), reducing the number of expensive evaluations could accelerate research cycles and enable exploration of larger design spaces. For machine learning applications, the approach could improve conditional sampling from large models like LLMs, enhancing their controllability for specific tasks. The methodological contribution of integrating surrogate modeling, generative sampling, and active learning is valuable to the broader research community. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and provides reasonable arguments for why the approach could achieve significant improvements over existing methods. However, the actual impact would depend on the magnitude of improvement in sample efficiency, which remains to be demonstrated, and the approach might face competition from other emerging methods for discrete optimization and sampling."
