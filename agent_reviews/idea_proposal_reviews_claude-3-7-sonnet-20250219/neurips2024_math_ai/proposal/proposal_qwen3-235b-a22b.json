    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of evaluating mathematical reasoning in AI models, particularly focusing on the question of 'To what extent can machine learning models comprehend mathematics?' The proposal incorporates the key elements from the research idea, including procedural content generation for mathematical problems, adaptive difficulty adjustment, and contamination-resistant evaluation. It also builds upon the literature review, citing relevant works like Mathador-LM, ReasonEval, and TATA, and addressing challenges identified in the review such as data contamination and evaluation of reasoning processes. The proposal comprehensively covers the workshop topics of measuring mathematical reasoning, new capabilities, and educational applications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is described in detail with concrete examples and mathematical formulations. The adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism is particularly well-explained with specific formulas and thresholds. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of the step validity metric could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the PCG framework and the adaptive difficulty adjustment could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'semantic hashing') are mentioned without full explanation. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible but has minor areas for improvement in technical specificity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing concepts into a cohesive framework. The combination of procedural content generation, adaptive difficulty adjustment, and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics creates a novel approach to mathematical reasoning assessment. The proposal extends beyond existing work like Mathador-LM by incorporating skill-specific adaptation and step-level analysis. However, many of the individual components draw heavily from existing literature (e.g., ReasonEval for step validity, Mathador-LM for dynamic benchmarks), and the core idea of procedural content generation for assessment is not entirely new. The proposal's innovation lies more in the integration and application of these concepts rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques. The skill-specific adaptation mechanism is perhaps the most novel contribution, though it builds on established adaptive testing principles."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established methodologies. The procedural content generation framework is based on clear structural constraints and parameter ranges, and the adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism is formalized with specific mathematical formulations. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive, covering both traditional accuracy and more nuanced aspects like step validity and generalization. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, comparative benchmarks, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes human validation to address edge cases. The technical formulations are correct and clearly presented. One minor limitation is that the proposal could provide more detailed justification for some of the parameter choices (e.g., thresholds τ_high and τ_low) and more rigorous statistical analysis methods for evaluating the results."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a feasible approach with realistic implementation steps. The procedural content generation framework is well-defined and implementable using existing technologies. The adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism uses straightforward mathematical formulations that can be readily coded. The evaluation methodology leverages established metrics and benchmarks. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) creating 1,000+ high-quality parameterized templates would require significant manual effort and expertise, (2) ensuring that generated problems are truly novel and not semantically equivalent to training data is challenging, (3) the human validation component with mathematicians could be resource-intensive, and (4) the proposal doesn't fully address computational requirements for large-scale evaluations across multiple models. While the core approach is practical, these implementation challenges might require additional resources or scope adjustments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in AI evaluation - the assessment of genuine mathematical reasoning capabilities in LLMs beyond static benchmarks. This work has significant implications for both AI research and educational applications. For AI research, it offers a more robust and contamination-resistant evaluation framework that could become a standard for assessing mathematical reasoning. The diagnostic insights into model strengths and weaknesses could guide future model development and training strategies. For education, the adaptive tutoring systems and teacher dashboards could enhance personalized learning, particularly in resource-constrained environments. The proposal's emphasis on evaluating reasoning processes rather than just final answers represents an important shift in assessment methodology. While the immediate impact might be focused on the AI research community, the potential long-term applications in education and other domains are substantial."
