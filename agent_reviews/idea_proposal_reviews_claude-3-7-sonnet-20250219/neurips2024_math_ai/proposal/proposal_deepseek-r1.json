    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's guiding theme of understanding machine learning models' mathematical comprehension capabilities. The proposal incorporates key topics from the task description, including measuring mathematical reasoning, new capabilities, and applications. It builds upon the core idea of procedural content generation for adaptive mathematical problem assessment to overcome data contamination issues. The methodology references relevant literature like ReasonEval (Xia et al., 2024) and builds upon concepts from papers like Mathador-LM and adaptive difficulty adjustment techniques mentioned in the literature review. The proposal's focus on both final answers and reasoning processes is consistent with the literature's emphasis on evaluating mathematical reasoning beyond accuracy."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical flow. The problem generation framework is explained in detail, including specific mathematical formulations for difficulty adjustment. The evaluation metrics are well-defined, covering accuracy, reasoning quality, diversity, and generalization gap. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact implementation details of the constraint-based generation system could be more specific, (2) the relationship between the Bayesian estimator and template variation could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'ReasonEval') are mentioned without full explanation of their mechanics. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining procedural content generation with adaptive difficulty adjustment specifically for mathematical reasoning assessment. While individual components like PCG, adaptive testing, and reasoning evaluation exist in prior work (as seen in the literature review), the integration of these approaches into a comprehensive framework for LLM evaluation is innovative. The proposal's emphasis on generating problems that adapt based on model performance to create diagnostic profiles is a fresh perspective. However, it shares similarities with existing approaches like Mathador-LM and other adaptive frameworks mentioned in the literature review. The proposal extends rather than fundamentally reimagines these approaches, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score. The template variation mechanism and the Bayesian difficulty estimator show creativity but build incrementally on existing techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established methodologies. The mathematical formulation for difficulty adjustment using a Bayesian estimator is rigorous and appropriate. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive, covering not just accuracy but also reasoning quality, diversity, and generalization. The experimental design includes appropriate models for comparison and includes ablation studies to test the impact of different components. The constraint-based generation approach ensures that problems are solvable and non-trivial. The proposal also acknowledges the importance of evaluating both final answers and intermediate reasoning steps, which aligns with current research directions. One minor limitation is that the proposal could provide more details on how the ReasonEval methodology will be integrated and how the generalization gap will be precisely measured. Overall, the technical foundations are solid with only minor gaps in the methodology."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technologies and methodologies. The procedural content generation approach for mathematical problems is well-established, and the adaptive difficulty adjustment has precedents in educational technology. The evaluation of multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude 3, etc.) is realistic given their availability. However, there are some implementation challenges that affect the feasibility score: (1) creating diverse, high-quality problem templates across multiple mathematical domains requires significant expertise and time, (2) ensuring that generated problems are both novel and pedagogically valid is non-trivial, (3) the Bayesian estimator for difficulty adjustment may require substantial tuning to work effectively across different problem types and models, and (4) the goal of generating 10,000+ problems with adaptive difficulty is ambitious and resource-intensive. While these challenges don't make the proposal impractical, they do represent significant hurdles that would need to be addressed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical issue in AI evaluation: the risk of data contamination in static benchmarks and the need to assess true reasoning capabilities rather than memorization. This work has significant potential impact across multiple domains. For AI development, it would provide more reliable evaluation methods and identify specific reasoning gaps to guide model improvements. In education, the adaptive problem generation could support personalized tutoring systems. For AI safety, the framework could help verify logical consistency in critical applications. The expected outcome of demonstrating a 15-30% performance drop on adaptive problems compared to static benchmarks would be an important finding for the field. The proposal's emphasis on evaluating the process of mathematical reasoning, not just final answers, aligns with important research directions. While the impact would be substantial within the AI evaluation community, it might not be transformative for the broader field of AI, which is why it doesn't receive the highest significance score."
