    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of measuring mathematical reasoning in LLMs and the challenge of creating contamination-resistant benchmarks. The proposal incorporates key elements from the literature review, including adaptive testing (TATA), reasoning quality evaluation (ReasonEval), and procedural content generation techniques mentioned in multiple papers. The methodology section clearly builds upon the cited works, particularly Mathador-LM, ReasonEval, and the adaptive difficulty adjustment papers. The proposal also addresses all major challenges identified in the literature review: data contamination, adaptive problem generation, evaluation of reasoning processes, generalization to unseen problems, and balancing multiple reasoning strategies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from motivation to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical details are presented with appropriate mathematical notation and algorithms, making the approach understandable to the target audience. The system architecture with four modules (Template Library, Problem Generator, Adaptive Selector, and Reasoning-Quality Evaluator) is well-defined, and the relationships between components are clearly explained. The experimental design section provides concrete details on baselines, models, metrics, and protocols. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as more details on how the difficulty function δᵢ is defined for different problem types and how the reasoning-quality metrics will be automatically computed without human intervention."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing approaches into a comprehensive framework. While individual components like procedural content generation, item-response theory, and reasoning quality evaluation have been explored separately in the literature, their combination into an end-to-end adaptive system represents a fresh perspective. The information-theoretic approach to problem selection is particularly innovative, using mutual information to guide the adaptive testing process. However, the core techniques (PCG, IRM, reasoning evaluation) are extensions of existing methods rather than fundamentally new approaches. The proposal builds incrementally on prior work like Mathador-LM, TATA, and ReasonEval rather than introducing entirely novel concepts. The integration is valuable but not groundbreaking."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for the adaptive selection algorithm using information gain and item-response models are well-justified and theoretically sound. The Bayesian updating approach for skill estimation is appropriate for the task. The reasoning quality metrics build logically on ReasonEval's framework with clear definitions for validity, redundancy, and efficiency. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, multiple models for testing, and statistical methods for comparing results. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components. However, there are some potential weaknesses: the proposal doesn't fully address how to validate the difficulty function δᵢ across different problem types, and the assumption that reasoning skills can be decomposed into discrete categories (algebra, geometry, etc.) may oversimplify the complex nature of mathematical reasoning."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it will require significant effort to implement fully. The technical components (template library, problem generator, adaptive selector, reasoning evaluator) are all implementable with current tools and APIs. The use of Python with NumPy/PyTorch and existing LLM APIs is practical. The experimental design is reasonable in scope, with a clear protocol and metrics. However, there are implementation challenges that may require additional resources or refinement: (1) Creating a diverse template library with well-calibrated difficulty functions across multiple mathematical domains will require substantial expert input; (2) Automatically evaluating reasoning quality without human intervention is challenging and may require sophisticated NLP techniques; (3) The information-theoretic adaptive selection may be computationally expensive for real-time use; and (4) The evaluation of 5 different models with 5 repetitions each represents a significant computational cost, especially if using commercial APIs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI evaluation - the need for contamination-resistant, adaptive benchmarks for mathematical reasoning. This work has the potential for significant impact in several ways: (1) It provides a more reliable way to assess genuine reasoning capabilities in LLMs, addressing a major concern in the field; (2) The fine-grained diagnostic profiles could guide more targeted improvements in model development; (3) The same framework could be adapted for educational applications, as noted in the broader impact section; (4) The methodology could extend beyond mathematics to other domains requiring procedural knowledge and logical reasoning. The expected outcomes, if achieved, would represent a meaningful advancement in how we evaluate AI systems. The alignment with the workshop's focus on mathematical reasoning in AI further enhances its significance. However, the impact may be somewhat limited by the technical complexity of the system, which could restrict its adoption to specialized research groups rather than becoming a widely used standard."
