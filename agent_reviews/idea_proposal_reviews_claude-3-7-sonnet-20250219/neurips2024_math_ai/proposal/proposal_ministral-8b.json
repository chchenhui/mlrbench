    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of evaluating mathematical reasoning in LLMs and focuses on creating adaptive, contamination-resistant benchmarks—a key concern highlighted in the literature review. The proposal incorporates concepts from multiple cited papers, including adaptive problem generation (similar to Mathador-LM), reasoning quality assessment (drawing from ReasonEval), and procedural content generation techniques. The methodology section clearly outlines how the system will generate diverse problem instances based on templates and constraints, adapting difficulty based on LLM performance, which directly implements the main idea presented in the research idea section."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the algorithmic steps are presented in a systematic manner. The inclusion of mathematical formulas helps to formalize key concepts. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the specific templates and constraints for problem generation could be more concretely defined with examples, (2) the exact mechanism for determining when to increase or decrease difficulty could be more precisely specified, and (3) the evaluation metrics, while mentioned, could be more thoroughly developed with specific thresholds or benchmarks for success."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The integration of procedural content generation with adaptive difficulty adjustment and reasoning quality assessment creates a comprehensive system that goes beyond current static benchmarks. The approach of dynamically generating problems based on LLM performance is innovative and addresses a significant gap in current evaluation methods. However, many of the individual components draw heavily from existing work cited in the literature review (e.g., ReasonEval for reasoning assessment, Mathador-LM for dynamic benchmarking). While the combination is novel, the proposal could push boundaries further by introducing more fundamentally new techniques rather than primarily synthesizing existing approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established methodologies. The research design logically connects procedural content generation, adaptive problem generation, and reasoning quality assessment. The mathematical formulations provide a solid theoretical foundation for the key components of the system. The experimental design includes appropriate baseline comparisons and evaluation metrics. The methodology draws appropriately from relevant literature, particularly in addressing data contamination concerns and reasoning quality assessment. There are some minor gaps in the technical details—for instance, the exact algorithms for template selection and constraint application could be more thoroughly specified—but overall, the approach is rigorous and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that could be implemented with current technologies and methodologies. The procedural content generation approach for mathematical problems is well-established, and the adaptive components build on existing work in the field. The experimental design is practical and achievable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require significant effort: (1) creating a diverse set of high-quality problem templates across various mathematical domains will be labor-intensive, (2) developing reliable metrics for reasoning quality assessment is complex and may require substantial validation, and (3) ensuring that the adaptive system truly captures reasoning abilities rather than just pattern recognition will require careful design and testing. While these challenges are surmountable, they represent non-trivial hurdles to full implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical issue in AI evaluation—the need for contamination-resistant, adaptive benchmarks for mathematical reasoning. This work has the potential for substantial impact across multiple domains: (1) it would provide more accurate assessments of LLM capabilities, addressing a major concern in the field; (2) the adaptive nature of the system could lead to improved training methodologies for mathematical reasoning; (3) the detailed diagnostic profiles would offer valuable insights for model development; and (4) the approach could be extended to other reasoning domains beyond mathematics. The practical applications span software verification, education, and scientific research, aligning perfectly with the workshop's focus areas. The potential to fundamentally change how we evaluate and understand mathematical reasoning in AI systems makes this proposal highly significant."
