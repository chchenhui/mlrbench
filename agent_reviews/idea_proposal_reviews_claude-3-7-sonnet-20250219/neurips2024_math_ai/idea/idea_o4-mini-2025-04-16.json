        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The CogMatTest idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on mathematical reasoning and AI. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of measuring mathematical reasoning abilities in LLMs, which is explicitly listed as one of the workshop topics. The proposal also touches on comparative evaluation between humans and AI models, another key workshop topic. The adaptive benchmark would provide insights into AI capabilities in mathematics and potential applications in education, which are also central to the workshop's interests. The only minor limitation in alignment is that it doesn't extensively address all potential applications mentioned in the workshop description (like software verification, sciences, engineering, finance)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main components, and expected outcomes. The three key components (Skill Taxonomy & Item Bank, Adaptive Test Engine, Comparative Evaluation) are concisely explained. The cognitive skills being measured (inference, planning, generalization) are briefly mentioned, though more examples would strengthen clarity. The proposal clearly explains how the benchmark would work adaptively and what outcomes are expected. There are some minor ambiguities about the specific implementation details of the IRT calibration process and how exactly the multidimensional proficiency profiles would be constructed and visualized, but these are reasonable omissions given the space constraints."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining several existing concepts in a new way. While mathematical benchmarks for LLMs exist (like GSM8K, MATH dataset), the cognitive-skill-centered approach with adaptive testing represents a fresh perspective. The use of item response theory for calibrating problem difficulty in AI evaluation is relatively uncommon. The multidimensional profiling of mathematical reasoning abilities is more nuanced than typical pass/fail benchmarks. However, the core components (skill taxonomies, IRT, adaptive testing) are established methodologies in educational assessment, and the novelty comes primarily from their application to AI evaluation rather than from fundamentally new techniques. The proposal builds upon rather than revolutionizes existing evaluation paradigms."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Creating a comprehensive cognitive skill taxonomy for mathematical reasoning is complex and potentially contentious among experts. Developing and calibrating a sufficiently large item bank with accurate skill annotations would require significant effort and expertise in both mathematics and cognitive science. The adaptive testing engine would need sophisticated algorithms to reliably measure multidimensional skill profiles. Validating that the test actually measures the intended cognitive skills (construct validity) would be challenging. However, the proposal builds on established educational testing methodologies, and similar adaptive testing systems exist in educational contexts. With sufficient resources and expertise, the project could be implemented, though likely requiring substantial refinement through multiple iterations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed benchmark addresses a significant gap in current LLM evaluation for mathematical reasoning. By providing fine-grained assessment of cognitive skills, it could substantially advance our understanding of AI capabilities and limitations in this domain. The adaptive nature would make testing more efficient and informative than static benchmarks. The comparative evaluation between humans and AI models could yield valuable insights for both AI development and cognitive science. The potential applications in education and theorem proving are meaningful and could lead to improved human-AI collaboration. The benchmark could guide more targeted improvements in model architecture and training, potentially accelerating progress in mathematical reasoning capabilities. While focused specifically on mathematical reasoning rather than broader AI capabilities, this is an important area with wide-ranging implications."
