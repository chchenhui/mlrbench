        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on mathematical reasoning and AI. It directly addresses one of the core topics mentioned in the task description: 'Measuring mathematical reasoning: How do we design benchmarks which accurately evaluate mathematical reasoning abilities, especially in an era of large language models?' The proposal tackles the challenge of benchmark contamination and offers a dynamic evaluation approach that goes beyond static assessments. It also touches on understanding the differences between human-like reasoning and pattern matching in LLMs, which relates to the 'Humans vs. machines' topic in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (static benchmarks becoming outdated or compromised), proposes a specific solution (procedural content generation of math problems with adaptive difficulty), and outlines expected outcomes (contamination-resistant evaluation and diagnostic profiles). The concept of adapting problem generation based on model performance is particularly well-explained. However, some minor details could be further elaborated, such as the specific mechanisms for determining problem difficulty, the exact adaptation algorithms, and how the system would validate that generated problems are solvable and appropriate."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by combining procedural content generation with adaptive testing for mathematical reasoning assessment. While procedural generation itself is not new, and adaptive testing exists in educational contexts, their application to create dynamic, contamination-resistant benchmarks for LLMs represents a fresh approach. The focus on generating problems that specifically target different reasoning skills and adapt based on model performance is innovative. The approach moves beyond the current paradigm of static benchmarks toward a more sophisticated understanding of model capabilities. However, it builds upon existing concepts in educational testing and procedural generation rather than introducing a completely revolutionary methodology."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed research is feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Creating templates for procedural generation of mathematical problems is achievable, as demonstrated by existing educational software. The adaptive component adds complexity but is implementable with current technology. However, several practical challenges exist: ensuring generated problems are mathematically valid and have unique solutions, controlling for difficulty in a consistent way across problem types, and developing reliable metrics to assess when a model is using genuine reasoning versus pattern matching. The proposal would benefit from more details on how these challenges would be addressed, but overall, the idea appears implementable with current resources and expertise in mathematical problem generation and LLM evaluation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical issue in the evaluation of LLMs for mathematical reasoning. As models are increasingly trained on vast datasets that may include benchmark problems, the ability to generate novel, unseen problems is essential for accurate assessment. The adaptive nature of the proposed system would provide much deeper insights into model capabilities than current static benchmarks, potentially revealing specific strengths and weaknesses in different reasoning domains. This could significantly advance our understanding of LLM mathematical comprehension and guide future development. The approach could also establish a new paradigm for AI evaluation beyond mathematics, making it highly significant for the broader field of AI assessment and benchmarking."
