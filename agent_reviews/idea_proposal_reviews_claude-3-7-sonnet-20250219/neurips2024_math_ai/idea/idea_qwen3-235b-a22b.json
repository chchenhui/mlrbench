        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on the intersection of AI and mathematical reasoning. It directly addresses the educational application of LLMs in mathematics, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest. The proposal specifically targets underserved regions with limited educational resources, which matches the workshop's interest in education 'especially in contexts with limited educational resources.' The idea also explores the capabilities of AI systems in mathematical reasoning through a hybrid LLM-RL approach, addressing the 'new capabilities' topic. The proposal is highly relevant to the guiding theme of comprehending mathematics through machine learning models and their applications."

        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, approach, methodology, and expected outcomes. The hybrid model combining LLMs with RL is well-defined, and the specific components (step-by-step solutions, error-specific feedback, dynamic problem reformulation) are clearly outlined. The technical approach involving pretraining on curated datasets and fine-tuning via human-AI collaborative labeling is specific and understandable. The only minor ambiguities lie in the details of how the RL framework will precisely track and adapt to student progress, and how the 'relevance feedback' loop will be implemented technically. These aspects could benefit from further elaboration, but overall, the idea is presented with strong clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining LLMs with RL specifically for mathematical reasoning tutoring. While both LLMs and RL have been applied separately to educational contexts, their integration for adaptive math tutoring with symbolic (LaTeX) and textual formats represents a fresh approach. The 'relevance feedback' loop for student corrections to refine future interactions adds an innovative element. However, the core components (LLMs for generating explanations, RL for adaptation) build upon existing approaches in educational technology and AI. The proposal extends and combines known techniques in a valuable but not revolutionary way, making it notably innovative but not groundbreaking in its fundamental approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. LLMs have demonstrated strong capabilities in mathematical reasoning and explanation generation, and RL frameworks for adaptive learning exist. The proposal to use curated datasets like Olympiad problems and the MATH dataset provides concrete resources for implementation. However, there are moderate challenges: fine-tuning via human-AI collaborative labeling requires significant resources; creating a robust RL framework that accurately tracks conceptual understanding (not just correctness) is complex; and achieving a 20-30% improvement over static models is an ambitious target that may require substantial iteration. The implementation is realistic but would require considerable expertise and resources to execute effectively."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical problem in education - the lack of access to personalized math tutoring in underserved regions. The potential impact is substantial, as mathematical reasoning skills are fundamental to many fields and career paths. If successful, this system could significantly democratize access to quality math education globally. The approach tackles the challenging problem of adapting to individual learning gaps and fostering conceptual understanding rather than just procedural knowledge. The focus on symbolic reasoning and proof-based mathematics addresses higher-order thinking skills that are particularly difficult to teach at scale. The real-world applications are clear and important, with potential to transform educational opportunities for millions of learners without access to expert mentors."
