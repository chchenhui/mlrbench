        "justification": "The paper is well-written and generally easy to understand. The abstract clearly outlines the problem, proposed solution, and key results. The introduction effectively motivates the need for dynamic data valuation in RAG systems and lists the contributions. The structure is logical, with dedicated sections for related work, methodology, experiments, analysis, and conclusion. Figures and tables are used to present results clearly. A minor point for improvement is the mapping between the conceptual formulas in Section 4.2 (e.g., for Contribution Score CS and Aggregated Value Score V) and their concrete implementation within the `DynamicRAGValuation` class in the code, which could be made more explicit."

        "justification": "The paper proposes a RAG-Informed Dynamic Data Valuation framework, which integrates lightweight attribution, contribution quantification, retrieval frequency, and user feedback into a dynamic pricing mechanism for data chunks in a marketplace. While dynamic data valuation and attribution in RAG systems are existing research areas (as cited), their specific combination and application to create a continuously updating, fair pricing model for RAG-specific data contributions appears novel. The emphasis on the dynamic, context-dependent utility of data chunks within RAG systems and translating this into economic value is a key original aspect. The framework itself, as a system, is a novel contribution to data marketplaces for FMs."

        "justification": "The overall experimental setup, including the simulation environment, comparison with baselines (static, popularity, simplified Data Shapley), and evaluation metrics (price-quality correlation, Gini, volatility), is largely sound. The quantitative results reported in the paper (Table 1, abstract, analysis, figure captions) are consistent with the outputs that would be generated by the provided code (verified against `run_experiments.log` for Pearson correlations and ROUGE scores, and inferred for other metrics from `data_valuation.py` and `visualization.py`). The figures also appear to be genuine representations of the code's output. \nHowever, there's a significant discrepancy in the description of a methodological component: Section 4.2.1 describes 'Attention-based Attribution' as 'Leveraging cross-attention weights between output tokens and input tokens from retrieved chunks'. The provided code in `rag_system.py` (class `AttentionBasedAttributor`) implements a much simpler heuristic: '0.3 * retrieval_scores[i] + 0.7 * overlap_ratio' (term overlap between answer and chunk, combined with normalized retrieval score). This is not a simplification of cross-attention analysis but a different, less sophisticated method. This misrepresentation of a key mechanism affects the soundness of the described methodology. The 'Lightweight Perturbation-based Attribution' is implemented as described. The Data Shapley method is acknowledged as simplified. The core dynamic valuation logic in `data_valuation.py` is a reasonable implementation of the paper's conceptual goals, though not a direct formula-to-formula match."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper addresses an important and timely problem: fair and dynamic valuation of data in the context of Foundation Models, particularly for Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems. Establishing equitable data marketplaces is crucial for fostering a healthy data ecosystem. The proposed framework, if the methods were all robustly and accurately described, has the potential to incentivize high-quality data contributions and improve the transparency of data economies. The reported results (e.g., Spearman's rho of 0.453 for price-quality correlation for the proposed method vs. 0.199 for static) suggest a substantial improvement over existing simpler models. The work aligns well with the themes of the DATA-FM workshop, particularly concerning data attribution and economic models for data pricing. The provision of code enhances reproducibility, which is significant."
