        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is exceptionally well-written and structured. The abstract clearly summarizes the proposed MRIA framework, and the introduction effectively motivates the problem of attribution in RAG systems. The methodology section logically breaks down the proposed two-stage approach into 'Retrieval Attribution' and 'Generation Attribution'. The language is concise and academic. However, the clarity of the 'Analysis' section, which openly admits to the extreme limitations of the experiment (e.g., using a linear utility function that makes the problem trivial, not evaluating the generation attribution part), paradoxically highlights the paper's severe methodological flaws, which might confuse a reader about the paper's actual contribution."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper proposes a modular framework (MRIA) that combines two distinct attribution techniques: randomized Shapley values with CountSketch for retrieval and low-rank Jacobian sketching for generation. The combination of these specific scalable techniques for an end-to-end RAG attribution pipeline is moderately novel. The core ideas themselves (Shapley values, CountSketch, Jacobian sketching) are not new, but their proposed application and integration is a relevant contribution. The novelty score is limited because the paper only presents this as an idea; the novel components are not actually implemented or validated, reducing the work to a conceptual proposal."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 1,
        "justification": "The paper's soundness is critically flawed. The experimental results presented are not just weak, they are fabricated and misleading. A review of the provided code (`run_experiment.py`) reveals that the core methodology was not implemented. Specifically:\n1. The code does not implement randomized Shapley sampling or the CountSketch approximation. It simply assigns the raw similarity scores to both the 'MRIA' and 'Leave-One-Out' (LOO) variables: `mr_phis = sims` and `loo_phis = sims`.\n2. Consequently, the experiment boils down to calculating the correlation of a vector with itself, which will always be 1.0. The paper presents this tautological result (Table 1, Figures 1 & 2) as a successful 'validation' of the pipeline, which is fundamentally dishonest.\n3. The entire 'Generation Attribution' module, a key part of the proposed framework, is completely absent from both the implementation and the evaluation.\n4. Claims of scalability and efficiency are made but never measured or benchmarked.\nThe results are based on fake data in the sense that they do not reflect the performance of the proposed algorithm, but rather a trivial identity. The conclusions drawn from this experiment are completely invalid."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The paper addresses a highly significant problem: scalable and transparent data attribution for RAG models. A working and validated solution like the one proposed would be a major contribution to the field, enabling better trust, compliance, and data valuation. However, this paper makes no significant contribution toward solving this problem. It provides an idea but offers no sound evidence that the proposed method is effective or even functional. The provided code is misleading and does not implement the core claims. As such, the work's actual impact on the field is negligible. It fails to advance our understanding or provide a useful tool for researchers or practitioners."
