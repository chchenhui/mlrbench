        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written, with a logical structure and clear articulation of the proposed method (GIF). The abstract, introduction, and methodology sections effectively convey the core ideas. Equations and step-by-step descriptions are used appropriately. However, some inconsistencies between the paper's experimental setup description (e.g., number of clusters C=10, test set size of 500 samples) and the details in the provided configuration files (`config.json` showing 100 clusters, `config_simplified.json` implying a smaller test set from 500 total synthetic samples) can create confusion when trying to map the paper to the code."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper proposes a two-stage attribution pipeline (GIF) combining fingerprinting with influence-based refinement. The fingerprinting method uses a combination of static embeddings and gradient signatures from a small, dedicated 'probe network'. While gradient-based fingerprints and influence functions are not new in attribution, the use of a probe network for generating these gradient signatures specifically for fingerprinting, and its integration into this two-stage process, appears to be the main novel contribution. The paper positions this as a scalable and accurate approach. The novelty score is moderate as it builds upon existing concepts but combines them in a potentially new way with the probe network idea."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 1,
        "justification": "The soundness of the paper is critically undermined by several major issues related to its experimental validation and reproducibility: \n1. Placeholder Results: The provided code includes a script `generate_placeholder_figures.py`. This script contains hardcoded values that exactly match the quantitative results reported in the paper's Table 1 (Precision@1, MRR, Latency for GIF, TRACE, TRAK) and the data for Figures 1-6 (Precision@k, MRR, Latency Comparison, GIF Latency Breakdown, Ablation Studies). This strongly indicates that the figures and potentially the table in the paper are not generated from actual experimental runs of the provided codebase but are placeholders.\n2. Flawed Simplified Experiment Code: The paper's abstract states results are on 'synthetic test data (500 samples)', implying the use of a simplified experiment. The `run_simplified_experiment.py` script, intended for this, has critical flaws:\n    a. The TRACE baseline is mocked using a `MockEncoder` that generates random embeddings, not a proper TRACE implementation. The script even comments, 'In a real experiment, you would train the TRACE model.'\n    b. The TRAK baseline, reported in Table 1, is not implemented or run in this script.\n    c. The script contains bugs that cause runtime errors, as evidenced by the provided `run.log`. Specifically, a `RuntimeError` due to tensor device mismatch during fingerprint concatenation and an `AssertionError` in FAISS when building the TRACE index (due to inconsistent embedding dimensions).\n3. Inconsistent Experimental Details: There are discrepancies regarding the test set size. The paper mentions a 'synthetic test data (500 samples)'. The `config_simplified.json` uses `num_samples: 500` which is then split 70/15/15 for train/val/test, resulting in a test set of 75 samples, and `num_test: 30` is also in this config. This contradicts the paper's claim of a 500-sample test set for the main results.\n4. Parameter Discrepancies: The paper states C=10 clusters for the probe network's pseudo-labels in the experiment setup, which aligns with `config_simplified.json` (`num_classes: 10`). However, the main `config.json` for potentially larger experiments specifies `n_clusters: 100`.\n\nGiven these points, the experimental results presented in the paper are not reliable, not reproducible with the provided code for the described setting, and appear to be based on placeholder data. This represents a fundamental flaw in the paper's soundness."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The problem of scalable and accurate data attribution for foundation models is highly significant. If the proposed GIF method performed as claimed (high precision, low latency, scalability to 10^7-10^8 samples), it would be a valuable contribution to the field, with applications in IP protection, auditing, and model debugging. However, the critical soundness issues, particularly the use of placeholder experimental results and a non-functional simplified experiment script, mean that the paper currently fails to demonstrate these contributions effectively. The claimed significant outperformance of baselines is not substantiated. Therefore, while the problem is important and the proposed ideas have potential, the current work's significance is severely diminished by the lack of credible validation."
