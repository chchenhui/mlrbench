    "Consistency": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper maintains consistency with its core research idea and the task description. However, significant inconsistencies arise when comparing the executed experiments and their outcomes against the research proposal's ambitious scope, particularly regarding the number of clusters (K=5 vs. proposed K≈1000), dataset variety, evaluation tasks, and the anticipated performance (≤1% degradation vs. actual significant drop). The abstract's claim of 'aiming to maintain competitive model performance' is not well-supported by the reported metrics, although the analysis section acknowledges these discrepancies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written with a logical structure. The methodology, including complex concepts like influence functions and Hessian approximations, is explained with reasonable clarity. However, clarity is diminished by unexplained experimental details, such as the 'Embedding Dimension: 256' (conflicting with derivation from CLIP's native dimension) and the 'Relative Training Time: 0.00' values across all methods, which are not adequately justified. While the analysis section clarifies the performance issues, the initial framing in the abstract could be more aligned with the results."
    },
    "Completeness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The paper is notably incomplete in its experimental validation when measured against the research proposal. Only one of the three proposed datasets (a subset of MS COCO) was used, and only image-caption retrieval was quantitatively evaluated, omitting proposed tasks like image captioning and VQA. Crucially, quantitative fairness metrics and detailed quantitative results from ablation studies (e.g., on K, r, w_max) are missing, despite their importance outlined in the proposal. The critical hyperparameter K was tested at a value (5) far from the proposed (≈1000), and the iterative curation loop was not experimentally assessed."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The theoretical underpinnings of the InfluenceSpace methodology (hierarchical clustering and influence-based weighting) are sound. However, the soundness of the empirical findings is severely undermined by the experimental design choices, particularly the extremely low number of clusters (K=5). This choice likely prevents the method from performing optimally and makes the reported poor retrieval performance an unreliable indicator of the method's true potential. Claims regarding fairness improvements are qualitative and lack quantitative backing in the results table. The analysis section provides a sound discussion of these limitations, but the core experimental evidence for the method's efficacy as presented is weak."
