    "Consistency": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The paper shows notable inconsistencies. Firstly, the abstract's claim of 'maintaining competitive performance' is contradicted by the experimental results in Table 1, where InfluenceSpace's Recall@1 (10.00) is substantially lower than the Full Dataset (32.50) and Random Sampling (30.00). Secondly, the 'Relative Training Time' metric in Table 1 is reported as 0.00 for all methods, including the 'Full Dataset'. This is inconsistent with the metric's definition ('Relative training time compared to using the full dataset') and expected behavior (Full Dataset should be 1.0, curated sets < 1.0 if faster), rendering the efficiency claims unsubstantiated as presented. Thirdly, the experimental execution (e.g., K=5 clusters) is a significant simplification from the research proposal's K~1000, and the paper does not cover all datasets (Visual Genome, Conceptual Captions) or tasks (Image Captioning, VQA) outlined in the proposal. While the paper follows the general research idea, these deviations and internal contradictions in results significantly lower its consistency."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper is generally well-structured and the writing is mostly clear. However, there are significant clarity issues that hinder full comprehension. The 'Relative Training Time' metric in Table 1 is a major point of confusion, as its reported value of 0.00 for all methods is unexplained and counterintuitive given its definition. Figure 1, which is referenced in Section 5.2 for cluster analysis, is missing from the provided paper text, making it impossible to assess that part of the analysis. Furthermore, the fairness evaluation (Section 5.3) and ablation studies (Section 5.4) are described qualitatively without concrete quantitative results, reducing the clarity of their impact and findings. While the methodology is described step-by-step, these omissions and confusing data points detract from overall clarity."

    "Completeness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The paper is incomplete in several key areas when compared to the research proposal and standard expectations for empirical work. It does not report experiments on all proposed datasets (Visual Genome, Conceptual Captions are missing) or tasks (Image Captioning, VQA metrics like BLEU, CIDEr, VQA accuracy are absent). The crucial fairness evaluation lacks detailed quantitative metrics (e.g., the proposed performance gap Î” reduction). Ablation studies are mentioned, but quantitative results supporting the qualitative statements are not provided. The proposed baseline of 'DataInf-style individual influence estimation without clustering' is also missing from the comparison. Additionally, Figure 1, referenced for cluster analysis, is not included. The experimental setup uses K=5 clusters, a drastic reduction from the K~1000 mentioned in the proposal, without sufficient justification for such a small number in the context of a large dataset like MS COCO. These omissions make the validation of the research idea feel preliminary and partial."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The core methodological idea of using hierarchical clustering and influence functions for data curation is plausible. However, the soundness of the experimental validation and the conclusions drawn is questionable due to several critical flaws. Firstly, the choice of K=5 clusters for a dataset like MS COCO is extremely small and unlikely to capture meaningful semantic diversity or adequately test a 'hierarchical' curation approach intended for large-scale FMs. Secondly, the reported performance for InfluenceSpace, particularly Recall@1 (10.00), is significantly inferior to both the Full Dataset (32.50) and Random Sampling (30.00), which contradicts the claim of 'competitive performance' and questions the practical utility of the method as presented. Thirdly, the 'Relative Training Time' reported as 0.00 for all methods is nonsensical given its definition and invalidates any claims about measured training efficiency benefits, a key motivation for the work. Fourthly, claims regarding fairness improvements are not substantiated with quantitative evidence in the main results. These issues in experimental design and result interpretation severely undermine the soundness of the paper's findings."
