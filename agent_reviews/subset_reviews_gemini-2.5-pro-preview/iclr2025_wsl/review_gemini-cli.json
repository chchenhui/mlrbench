        "justification": "The paper is exceptionally well-written, with a clear and logical structure. It clearly articulates the problem, the proposed approach, and the experimental setup. The authors are commendably transparent about the inconclusive results, providing a thoughtful analysis in the discussion section. The language is precise, and the figures and tables effectively communicate the outcomes."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper proposes a novel approach to backdoor detection by treating neural network weights as a graph and applying a permutation-equivariant GNN. While the components (GNNs, backdoor detection) are not new, their combination to create a data-free detector that analyzes the static structure of a model is an original and interesting contribution to the nascent field of weight space analysis. The novelty lies in the problem formulation and the proposed methodology rather than in a new model architecture."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The paper has major soundness issues. While the reported results are reproducible from the provided code, there is a critical flaw in the implementation. The chosen GNN model (`GCNConv`) does not utilize edge features. This means the network weights, which are assigned to the graph edges, are completely ignored by the GNN during message passing. The GNN only learns from the graph topology and node features (bias terms). This fundamentally undermines the paper's central premise and invalidates the comparison against the MLP baseline. The paper's analysis attributes the GNN's failure to dataset size, but this implementation bug is a more direct and critical reason for the failure. Additionally, the experimental scale is extremely small (40 models total, 8 for testing), which is insufficient to draw any statistically significant conclusions."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper addresses a highly significant problem: data-free detection of backdoors in neural networks. A successful solution would have a major impact on AI security. The paper's contribution is in proposing a novel research direction and highlighting its challenges. However, due to the inconclusive results and the critical flaw in the experimental methodology, the paper does not deliver a tangible, reliable contribution. Its primary significance is as a preliminary, cautionary exploration that provides valuable lessons for future research, rather than presenting a working solution or a strong piece of evidence."
