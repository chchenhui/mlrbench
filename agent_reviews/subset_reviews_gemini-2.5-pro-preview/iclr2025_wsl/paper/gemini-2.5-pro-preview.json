    "Consistency": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper is largely consistent with the task description, research idea, and its own internal structure. The methodology (permutation-equivariant GNN, contrastive learning) directly follows the research idea and proposal. Experimental results presented in the paper align with its described setup and the provided 'Experimental Results' document. However, there are notable inconsistencies with the research proposal regarding the scale of execution: the dataset used (94 models) is drastically smaller than proposed (55,000+ models). Additionally, some baselines mentioned in the proposal (e.g., CRAIG, ModelNet, Task-Driven Embeddings) were replaced with Transformer and PCA in the paper. The paper acknowledges the dataset size as a limitation. The definition of permutation symmetry transformation was slightly different between the proposal and paper, but the paper noted this adjustment. Overall, the core scientific direction is consistent, but the experimental scope deviates significantly from the proposal's ambition."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The paper is very well-written, with clear and precise language. The structure (Abstract, Introduction, Related Work, Methodology, Experiments, Analysis, Conclusion) is logical and easy to follow. Arguments are presented coherently, building from the problem statement to the proposed solution and experimental validation. Technical concepts, such as permutation equivariance and the GNN architecture, are explained effectively. Tables and figures (as described by their captions and references) are used appropriately to support the findings. The abstract provides a concise and accurate summary of the work. The paper is accessible to readers familiar with machine learning and graph neural networks."

    "Completeness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper addresses the core research idea and aligns with the workshop's task description by exploring weight space symmetries and embeddings. However, it falls short of the completeness envisioned in the research proposal in several key areas. The most significant is the experimental dataset size (94 models vs. a proposed 55,000+), which limits the empirical validation of claims regarding 'massive model zoos'. Some baselines and detailed theoretical contributions (e.g., specific \\\\epsilon-distance preservation bounds) outlined in the proposal are not fully realized or are altered in the paper. Details like model quantization mentioned in the proposal are absent in the paper's experimental setup. Furthermore, deliverables like an opensourced API or benchmark datasets, mentioned as expected outcomes in the proposal, are not part of the paper. While the paper forms a complete research article in its structure, its scope is considerably narrower than proposed."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The core methodological approach—using a permutation-equivariant GNN trained with contrastive learning to embed neural network weights—is sound and innovative. The arguments for why equivariance should improve retrieval are well-reasoned. The experimental results, within their limited scope, consistently support the claim that the EquivariantGNN outperforms the chosen baselines (Transformer, PCA). However, the soundness of generalizing these findings is weakened by major limitations: 1) The extremely small dataset (94 models) is insufficient to robustly validate performance for large-scale model zoos. 2) The transfer learning evaluation relies on a proxy score rather than actual fine-tuning experiments, making its conclusions indirect. 3) The baselines, while reasonable, might not represent the state-of-the-art for this specific task, especially compared to those initially proposed. The theoretical sketch for equivariance is plausible, but deeper theoretical claims from the proposal are not fully substantiated in the paper. The paper acknowledges these limitations, which is good scientific practice, but they do impact the overall strength of the evidence."
