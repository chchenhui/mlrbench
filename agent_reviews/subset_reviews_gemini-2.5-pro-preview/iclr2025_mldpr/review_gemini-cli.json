        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The paper is exceptionally well-written, with a clear and logical structure. It effectively introduces the problem of narrow, single-metric benchmarking and clearly articulates the proposed solution, 'Contextualized Evaluation as a Service' (CEaaS). The methodology is presented with a simple formalization, a logical system architecture, and a clear algorithmic workflow. The case study is easy to follow and directly supports the paper's thesis. The authors are also transparent about the limitations of their work."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper's novelty lies not in inventing holistic evaluation (it builds on prior work like HELM) but in synthesizing existing ideas into a practical, user-driven, and service-oriented framework. The key novel contribution is the concept of 'Evaluation as a Service' integrated into repositories, where users can dynamically define an 'Evaluation Context' (formalized as C = (M, W, T)). This shifts the paradigm from static leaderboards to interactive, on-demand evaluation, which is a novel and valuable engineering and conceptual contribution to the field of ML evaluation."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed methods are sound. The service-oriented architecture is a standard and scalable design. The experimental setup is appropriate for a proof-of-concept, using relevant models and a suitable task. The provided code is well-structured, documented, and appears to correctly implement the described experiment. The results in Table 1 are plausible and the core conclusion—that model rankings invert based on context—is strongly supported by the data presented in Figure 2. The results are reproducible and reliable. The paper honestly acknowledges limitations, such as the use of a synthetic fairness metric and normalization being performed on a small set of models. There is a minor discrepancy between the radar chart figure, which appears illustrative, and the raw data, but the main bar chart and conclusions are consistent with the data."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper addresses a highly significant and timely problem in the ML community: the over-reliance on single-metric leaderboards and the resulting 'evaluation gap'. The proposed CEaaS framework offers a tangible and practical path for data and model repositories to foster more responsible and holistic evaluation practices. If adopted, this work could have a significant impact on how practitioners select and deploy models, moving the community towards a more mature evaluation culture. The work is highly relevant to the workshop's theme and has the potential for a lasting impact on ML data and benchmarking practices."
