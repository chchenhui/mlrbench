        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written and presents its core ideas in a structured manner. The proposed 'Contextual Dataset Deprecation Framework' and its five components are clearly articulated in Section 3. The introduction effectively sets the stage, and the related work section is adequate. However, clarity is diminished by several factors: 1) Figure 1, intended to illustrate the system architecture (mentioned in Section 4.1), is missing from the paper text ('Figure would be here showing the architecture'). 2) The descriptions of experimental results in Section 5.2 refer to Figures 2, 3, and 4, but the provided image files for these figures are either problematic or inconsistent with the textual descriptions (e.g., Figure 2 shows a value of 0.00 for acknowledgment time which is not well-explained, Figure 4 is an empty plot). 3) While mathematical notations are used for definitions (e.g., DeprecationRecord, Notify function), they are generally understandable."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper addresses the important and increasingly relevant problem of dataset deprecation. While the concept of dataset deprecation has been discussed (e.g., Luccioni et al., 2021, cited by the paper), this work proposes a more comprehensive and actionable framework. The novelty lies in: 1) The specific five-component structure of the 'Contextual Dataset Deprecation Framework' (Tiered Warning System, Notification System, Context-Preserving Deprecation, Alternative Recommendation System, Transparent Versioning System) as an integrated solution. 2) The design of an implementation architecture (Section 4) aimed at practical integration into ML repositories. 3) The attempt to provide an empirical evaluation comparing different deprecation strategies (Control, Basic, Full Framework), which is a novel contribution in this specific area, even if the execution and reporting of this evaluation have serious flaws. The paper identifies existing research gaps (Section 2.5) and aims to address them, particularly regarding implementation specifics and empirical validation."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The soundness of the paper is critically undermined by major flaws in its experimental methodology and reporting. 1) **Misrepresentation of Experimental Method**: Section 5.1.1 explicitly states, 'We recruited 150 ML researchers stratified by...' and describes tasks performed by these human participants. However, the provided codebase (`experimental_design.py`, `framework.py`, `run_experiment.py`) implements a purely simulation-based experiment where user responses, system performance, and research impact are simulated. This fundamental discrepancy between the claimed human study and the actual simulation invalidates the empirical claims regarding human behavior and the framework's real-world effectiveness as presented. 2) **Problematic and Misleading Figures**: Figure 1 (System Architecture) is missing. Figure 2 (Acknowledgment Time, `acknowledgment_time.png`) is a box plot showing a value of 0.00 for the 'FULL' strategy, which is highly unrealistic for human acknowledgment and suspicious even for a simulation without specific justification; the paper claims it shows 'significantly faster acknowledgment times' without proper comparative data in the figure. Figure 3 (Access Control Grant Rate, `access_control_grant_rate.png`) shows a 1.00 grant rate for the 'FULL' strategy, which, while possible in a simulation, is presented without sufficient context or comparison. Most critically, Figure 4 (Citation Patterns, `citation_patterns.png`) is an empty plot, yet Section 5.2.3 discusses findings derived from this supposedly informative figure ('The citation patterns show a gradual, controlled reduction...'). This suggests that either the results for Figure 4 were not successfully generated/plotted or are being reported without actual supporting data. 3) **Unsupported Conclusions**: The key findings (Section 5.3) and discussion points regarding user awareness, alternative adoption, and research continuity are based on the misrepresented experiments and flawed figures, making them unreliable. While the conceptual framework itself is plausible, its empirical validation as presented in the paper is not sound."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The problem of managing and deprecating ML datasets is of high significance to the ML community, directly aligning with the workshop's themes of data practices and repository challenges. A well-designed and validated framework for dataset deprecation could have a substantial positive impact on ethical ML, research integrity, and reproducibility. The paper's proposed framework, in principle, addresses an important need. However, the critical soundness issues, particularly the misrepresentation of the experimental validation and the problematic figures, severely diminish the significance of this specific work in its current form. If the study were transparently presented as a simulation with robust models and correctly reported results, or if it genuinely involved human participants as claimed and was reported accurately, its significance would be considerably higher. The potential for impact is high, but the current execution and reporting prevent the work from realizing that potential."
