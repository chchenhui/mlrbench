    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The paper demonstrates excellent consistency. It aligns very well with the task description's call for holistic and contextualized benchmarking. The research idea is faithfully expanded into a detailed proposal and a coherent paper. The methodology, experimental setup, and results are consistent with the stated goals. For instance, the problem of over-reliance on single metrics, highlighted in the introduction, is directly addressed by the proposed Benchmark Card framework and illustrated through experimental results where model selection changes based on holistic criteria. The paper's sections logically build upon each other, maintaining a consistent narrative and terminology. The experimental results (Table 3) were clarified with a revised version in the paper to ensure alignment with the textual summary, showing attention to internal consistency."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The paper is exceptionally clear and well-written. The structure is logical, progressing from problem definition to solution proposal, related work, methodology, experimental validation, and conclusion. Complex ideas like the components of a Benchmark Card and the rationale for holistic evaluation are explained in an accessible manner. Tables (e.g., detailing model performance and use-case weights) are clearly presented and support the text. The language is precise, and the arguments are easy to follow, making the paper highly understandable for the target audience of ML researchers and practitioners."

    "Completeness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is largely complete in presenting the concept of Benchmark Cards. It thoroughly addresses the task description's concerns and fully develops the research idea into a detailed proposal. The six key components of a Benchmark Card are well-defined. The experimental results, while preliminary, are adequately presented and analyzed. The paper appropriately positions more extensive validation (e.g., populating cards for diverse, complex benchmarks, user studies, and developing advanced composite scoring) as future work, which is suitable for a paper introducing a new framework. A minor point is that ethical considerations for the research process itself, mentioned in the proposal, are not explicitly reiterated in the paper, though ethical considerations for datasets are a component of the Benchmark Card."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper's arguments for the necessity of Benchmark Cards are sound and well-supported by literature and prevailing issues in ML evaluation. The proposed Benchmark Card framework is logical and comprehensive. The experimental methodology is adequate for a proof-of-concept; however, its soundness for drawing generalizable conclusions is limited by the use of the simple Iris dataset, artificially defined use cases and weights, and conceptual/proxied metrics (e.g., 'Fairness Disparity' was not quantitatively measured using demographic subgroups, 'Model Complexity' was a simple proxy). The paper commendably acknowledges these limitations in detail, which strengthens its overall scientific integrity by not overstating the findings. The analysis of the results is reasonable within the context of this illustrative experiment."
