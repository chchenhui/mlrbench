        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written, with a logical structure and clear articulation of the CEVA framework, its components, and experimental setup. Mathematical notations are introduced for value representation and evolution. However, there's a notable discrepancy in the definition of the 'Adaptation Accuracy' metric between the paper's text (Section 4.4, formula based on ||V_h||) and the likely implementation in the provided code (based on normalizing by maximum possible distance). Additionally, while metrics like 'User Satisfaction' and 'Agency Preservation' are listed, their precise calculation methods (which are heuristic and simulation-specific) are detailed in the code but not fully elaborated in the paper itself, slightly reducing clarity on how these are derived."

        "justification": "The paper introduces the Co-Evolutionary Value Alignment (CEVA) framework, which builds upon the emerging concept of bidirectional human-AI alignment and co-evolution. The primary novelty lies in the explicit modeling of the reciprocal relationship between evolving human values and AI capabilities, featuring a multi-level value representation in the AI (core, cultural, personal) with differential adaptation rates. The formal mathematical modeling of value evolution and AI adaptation, along with the proposed bidirectional feedback mechanisms within this co-evolutionary context, represent a significant and original contribution to operationalizing these complex dynamics. While drawing from existing ideas, CEVA offers a more concrete and evaluable framework."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The methodology relies on a simulation-based approach, which is appropriate for an initial investigation of the proposed CEVA framework. The experimental design, comparing four models (static, adaptive, CEVA basic, CEVA full) across three distinct scenarios (gradual drift, rapid shift, value conflict), is sound for exploring the framework's properties. The provided code appears to consistently implement the described models and scenarios, and the numerical results in Table 1 (e.g., stability of static model, agency preservation differences) are plausible and align with the code's logic and model definitions. The figures mentioned in the paper are also generatable by the code. However, a key weakness is the discrepancy in the 'Adaptation Accuracy' formula between the paper and the code. While the results seem consistently generated using the code's definition, this inconsistency is a flaw. Furthermore, metrics like 'User Satisfaction' and 'Agency Preservation' are based on simulation-specific heuristics (e.g., satisfaction being tied to alignment score, agency to reflection prompt frequency), which limits their external validity, though this is a common limitation in such simulation studies and is acknowledged by the authors."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper addresses the highly significant and challenging problem of aligning AI systems with human values that are dynamic and evolve over time. The proposed CEVA framework offers a novel perspective and a tangible approach to tackling this co-evolutionary dynamic, which is crucial for long-term human-AI interaction. The findings, even from simulation, provide valuable insights: confirming the inadequacy of static alignment, highlighting the surprising effectiveness of simple adaptive mechanisms, and demonstrating the nuanced trade-offs (e.g., adaptation accuracy vs. stability, agency vs. proactive feedback) of the CEVA models. The work is highly relevant to the workshop's theme of bidirectional human-AI alignment and has the potential to stimulate further research into more robust and adaptive alignment strategies."
