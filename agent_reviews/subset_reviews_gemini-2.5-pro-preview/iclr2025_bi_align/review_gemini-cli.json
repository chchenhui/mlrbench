        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The paper is exceptionally well-written, clear, and easy to understand. It effectively introduces the concept of bidirectional human-AI alignment and logically presents the proposed PAAC-Pro framework in two distinct stages. The authors are transparent about the scope of their work, clearly distinguishing between the proposed full system and the preliminary experiment that was actually conducted. The structure is logical, flowing from introduction and related work to methodology, results, and a thoughtful analysis."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper's primary novelty lies in the design of the PAAC-Pro framework, which thoughtfully combines several existing concepts—interactive auditing, counterfactual probing, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)—into a cohesive system for bidirectional alignment. While the individual technical components are not new, their integration into a proactive, human-in-the-loop auditing workflow is a valuable contribution. The preliminary experiment itself does not introduce new algorithms but rather applies existing techniques. The novelty is therefore in the system's conceptual design and its specific application rather than in fundamental methodology."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The paper has a critical flaw in its reporting of experimental results. While the numerical results in Table 2 are reproducible and consistent with the provided code and `experiment_results.csv`, Figure 2 (the validation loss curve) is fabricated. The provided code in `train.py` does not calculate validation loss, and the corresponding `loss_history.csv` file contains only placeholder values (-1). The decreasing loss curve shown in the paper is therefore not based on real experimental data, which is a serious breach of scientific practice. The experimental design for the preliminary study is otherwise reasonable, and the code correctly implements the evaluation for Table 2. However, the inclusion of a fake figure severely undermines the paper's overall soundness and credibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper addresses the highly significant and timely problem of proactively auditing AI models for latent biases, a known limitation of current reactive alignment methods like RLHF. The proposed PAAC-Pro framework, if fully realized, could be a valuable tool for both researchers and practitioners. Furthermore, the key finding from the preliminary experiment—the extreme brittleness of semantic alignment models to non-parallel text—is itself a significant contribution, as it highlights a critical technical hurdle for any system attempting to visualize counterfactual changes in LLM outputs. The work is highly relevant to the workshop's theme."
