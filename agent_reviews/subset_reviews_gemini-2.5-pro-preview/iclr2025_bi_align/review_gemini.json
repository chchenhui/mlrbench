        "justification": "The paper is well-structured with a logical flow from introduction to conclusion, and generally uses clear language for describing the proposed 'AI Cognitive Tutor' and its components. However, a significant issue impacting clarity is the misleading presentation of the experimental subjects. The abstract states, 'The experiment involved 60 participants,' and Section 5 ('Experiment Setup') details recruitment criteria for 'medical professionals or senior medical students.' This strongly implies human participants. It is only in the limitations section (Section 7) that it's mentioned the study used a 'simulated environment, potentially with programmatically generated participant behaviors.' The provided code confirms that participants were indeed simulated (`config.yaml`: `num_simulated_participants: 60`; `simulation/participant.py`). This lack of upfront transparency about the nature of the 'participants' fundamentally obscures what was actually evaluated and how the results should be interpreted, significantly reducing the overall clarity of the research conducted."

        "justification": "The paper proposes an 'AI Cognitive Tutor' aimed at the 'Aligning Humans with AI' dimension of the bidirectional human-AI alignment framework. Applying an adaptive tutoring system specifically to enhance human understanding of complex AI operations (like in medical diagnosis) and evaluating its impact on mental models, confusion, and trust calibration is a novel approach within this context. While adaptive tutoring itself is an established field, its specific design here, including the types of interventions (e.g., simplified explanations, analogies, contrastive explanations tailored for AI understanding) and triggers for user misunderstanding of an AI system, presents an original contribution. The paper acknowledges the foundational 'Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment' framework by Shen et al. (2024) and builds upon it."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The methodology for designing and implementing the AI Cognitive Tutor and the *simulation* environment is detailed and appears sound *as a simulation*. The provided code (`main.py`, `simulation/participant.py`, `models/cognitive_tutor.py`, etc.) seems to correctly implement the described simulation, including participant behavior, AI diagnostics, tutor interventions, and data logging. The figures provided are consistent with the output of the `visualization/visualizer.py` script using this simulated data. However, the paper's soundness as an empirical study evaluating effectiveness with *human users* is critically flawed. The core issue is the misrepresentation of simulated participants as actual human participants throughout most of the paper (Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Experiment Setup, Results). For instance, the abstract claims 'Results indicate that the AI Cognitive Tutor significantly improved users' mental model accuracy by 33.2% (p=0.0024)'. These results, including p-values and effect sizes (e.g., Table 1, Table 2), are derived from the simulation (`evaluation/metrics.py`). While the use of simulation is mentioned as a limitation in Section 7, this admission is insufficient to correct the misleading presentation. Conclusions about human cognitive alignment drawn from this simulated data are not adequately supported as if they were from human trials. The experimental results are 'real' outputs of the simulation code but not 'real' findings from human interaction."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The paper addresses an important problem: improving human understanding and collaboration with complex AI systems, which is a significant challenge in AI alignment. The concept of an AI Cognitive Tutor is potentially valuable. However, the significance of *this paper's specific findings* is substantially diminished due to the reliance on simulated participant data presented as if it were from human experiments. The reported improvements in mental model accuracy, reduced confusion, and enhanced trust calibration are outcomes of a simulation, not direct evidence from human studies. Therefore, their impact on understanding actual human-AI interaction is limited. The work could be significant as a proof-of-concept for the tutor's mechanics or as a detailed simulation study that generates hypotheses for future human trials. However, it is not framed this way, and the conclusions overstate the current empirical backing regarding human users. The reproducibility of the *simulation* is high given the code, but the reliability of these results for predicting real-world human behavior is low without actual human validation."
