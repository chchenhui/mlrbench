        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written and presents a logical structure. The core concepts of bidirectional alignment, Bayesian preference modeling, and uncertainty-driven querying are introduced clearly. The mathematical notation in Section 3.A is standard and understandable. However, the clarity is significantly undermined by the Results section (Section 5), where the textual claims of superiority are in direct contradiction with the data presented in the figures. For instance, the abstract claims UDCA 'reduces preference calibration error by ≥ 80%', but Figure 2 and the accompanying text show UDCA's error (≈1.5) is much higher than the passive baseline's (0.3). This inconsistency makes the paper's conclusions confusing and hard to trust."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper's novelty lies in combining several existing techniques—Bayesian preference modeling, active learning via uncertainty sampling, and interactive UIs—and applying them to the recently framed problem of 'bidirectional human-AI alignment'. The individual components are not new; for example, using information gain for active preference elicitation is a well-established idea. The main contribution is the synthesis of these components into a single co-adaptive framework (UDCA) and the explicit focus on aligning both the AI's model and the human's mental model. This framing is timely and relevant to the workshop's theme, but the underlying methodology is more of an incremental improvement than a groundbreaking discovery."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The paper suffers from critical soundness issues. \n1. **Contradictory Results:** The central claims of the paper are not supported by its own results. The abstract claims UDCA improves decision quality by '≥ 10%' and reduces PCE by '≥ 80%' compared to passive baselines. However, Figure 1 (generated by the provided code) shows that UDCA and the passive baseline achieve virtually identical decision quality. More critically, Figure 2 shows the Preference Calibration Error (PCE) for UDCA (≈1.5) is five times *worse* than the passive baseline (0.3). The paper's narrative is fundamentally at odds with its own data.\n2. **Method-Code Discrepancy:** The methodology section claims to select queries by maximizing the expected KL divergence, a principled information-theoretic criterion. The provided code, however, implements a much simpler heuristic: it finds the candidate with the highest variance and pairs it with a *random* other candidate. This is a significant misrepresentation of the proposed algorithm.\n3. **Unverifiable Claims:** The paper heavily relies on a 'small-scale user study' to validate its human-centered alignment claims (e.g., gains in trust, mental-model accuracy). However, no details, methodology, data, or code for this study are provided, rendering these results completely unverifiable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The problem of creating dynamic, co-adaptive systems for human-AI alignment is highly significant. A successful solution would have a substantial impact. However, this paper's contribution is undermined by its lack of soundness. Since the experimental results fail to demonstrate the claimed benefits of the proposed UDCA method over a simpler passive baseline, the practical significance of the work is minimal. The paper identifies an important problem but does not provide a convincingly superior solution. The promise to release a 'UI toolkit' is also not fulfilled by the provided code, which only contains the simulation experiment."
