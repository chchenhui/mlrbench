    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is largely consistent in its narrative, aligning the abstract, introduction, methodology, and discussion of results. It follows the core research idea of Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD) and the research proposal's outline. The reported experimental results (identical poor performance for UAD and baseline) are consistently presented and discussed as a key finding. The paper acknowledges the negative results. There's a slight inconsistency in that the methodology and introduction propose a broader evaluation of multiple uncertainty metrics and intervention strategies, while the experiments focus on a single combination (predictive entropy and token re-ranking). However, this is framed as 'initial results'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is well-structured, following a standard scientific format, which aids readability. The language is generally clear and academic. Core concepts like UAD, uncertainty estimation methods, and intervention strategies are explained. The problem statement and objectives are clearly articulated. Table 1 effectively summarizes the main quantitative results. The paper refers to figures (1-6) which are not rendered in the provided text; assuming these would be present and clear in a full version, they would further aid clarity. The arguments for the proposed method and the interpretation of the (negative) results are presented coherently."

    "Completeness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper addresses the main components of the task description (UQ for hallucinations), research idea (UAD framework), and research proposal. It includes a literature review, methodology, experimental setup, results, discussion, and future work. However, it's not fully complete in its experimental execution compared to the proposal. While multiple uncertainty estimation methods (predictive entropy, MC dropout, lightweight ensemble) and intervention strategies (re-ranking, constrained sampling, uncertainty signaling) are described in the methodology, the experiments only report results for predictive entropy and token re-ranking. The 'dynamic thresholding' mechanism, particularly the reward function and its adaptation during experiments, is not sufficiently detailed in the results or its impact clearly demonstrated, despite being a proposed component. The evaluation on only 50 SQuAD v2 samples is also a limitation in terms of comprehensive evaluation."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper's arguments for exploring UAD are logical, and it commendably reports negative results. However, the soundness of the experimental validation is a concern. The choice of distilgpt2 on SQuAD v2 with only 50 samples resulted in extremely poor baseline performance (100% hallucination rate, near-zero BLEU/ROUGE, very high perplexity). This makes it difficult to determine if UAD failed due to its own shortcomings or because the underlying model/task setup was already non-functional for QA. It's hard to isolate the effect of UAD. The dynamic thresholding mechanism's reward signal and its actual impact in the experiments are underspecified. While predictive entropy is a valid uncertainty measure, relying on this single metric in a setup where the model is already highly uncertain about everything limits the insights. The conclusions about UAD's ineffectiveness are supported by the presented data for *this specific setup*, but the setup itself is not robust enough to make broader claims about UAD's potential."

            "The experimental design (small model distilgpt2, challenging SQuAD v2 task, very small sample size of 50) leads to extremely poor baseline performance, making it difficult to meaningfully evaluate the proposed UAD method or draw generalizable conclusions.",

            "The paper's findings are limited to showing UAD did not work in a specific, highly challenging, and possibly ill-suited experimental setup, rather than providing strong evidence about the general viability or limitations of the UAD concept."
