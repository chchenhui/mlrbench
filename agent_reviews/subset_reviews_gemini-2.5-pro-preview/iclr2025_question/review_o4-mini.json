        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written with a logical structure (Abstract, Introduction, Related Work, Methodology, Experiments, Analysis, Conclusion). The core ideas of Self-Consistency–Evidence Calibration (SCEC) are articulated, and the contributions are clearly listed. Formulas for composite uncertainty and the decoding penalty are provided. However, there's some ambiguity regarding the term 'synthetic Natural Questions' – whether it refers to synthetic questions or a synthetic knowledge base for real NQ questions (the code suggests the latter with a synthetic corpus). Additionally, the exact mechanism of uncertainty-guided decoding for API models like Claude-3 (used for results) could be more explicitly distinguished in the main text from the direct probability modification formula, which is more applicable to local models."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper proposes SCEC, which combines self-consistency sampling (to gauge model variance) with external evidence retrieval and alignment (to check factual consistency). While self-consistency and evidence-based fact-checking are established techniques, their specific combination to derive a token-level composite uncertainty score, and then using this score in a dynamic decoding penalty (or a selection/refinement strategy for API models), presents a novel approach to UQ and hallucination mitigation. The two-stage inference pipeline that requires no model weight updates is a practical and somewhat novel framing for this problem."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The soundness of the paper is severely compromised by several critical issues: \n1. **Origin of Experimental Results:** The provided code includes a script `utils/generate_placeholder_images.py`. This script contains hardcoded data or uses random generation to create all figures presented in the paper (e.g., Figure 1 'QA Performance Comparison', Figure 2 'Uncertainty Distribution', Figure 5 'Alpha Ablation', etc.). The values used to generate Figure 1 (QA Performance) and the ablation figures match the paper's reported numbers (e.g., Table 1 values for SCEC: EM 0.875, F1 0.923, ECE 0.102; Vanilla: EM 0.825, F1 0.889, ECE 0.187). This strongly indicates that the figures and key numerical results in the paper are not derived from actual experimental runs of the main `run_experiments.py` script but are placeholders. This fundamentally undermines the validity of the reported findings.\n2. **Uncertainty-Guided Decoding Discrepancy:** The paper's methodology (Section 3.4) describes uncertainty-guided decoding by directly modifying token probabilities: \\\\tilde p_t(w)\\\\propto p_t(w)\\\\,\\\\exp\\\\bigl(-\\\\beta\\\\,u_t(w)\\\\bigr). However, the primary model used for results is Claude-3-7-Sonnet, an API-based model where direct probability manipulation is not possible. The provided code's `APIGuidedDecoder` (in `models/guided_decoding.py`) implements a different strategy for API models: generating multiple candidates and selecting the one with the lowest uncertainty, or refining the prompt if uncertainty is high. This is a practical workaround but is not the mechanism described by the formula. The paper should have clarified this distinction.\n3. **Limited Experimental Setup for 'Open-Domain QA':** The `run_experiments.py` script, by default, uses a synthetically generated corpus of only 1000 documents for evidence retrieval (`create_synthetic_corpus` in `models/evidence_retrieval.py`). This is a very small and simplified knowledge source for claims made about 'open-domain QA' on Natural Questions. Furthermore, the default `data_limit` in `run_experiments.py` is set to 50 examples, and ablation studies run on a subset of 10 examples, which are insufficient for robust conclusions.\n4. **Hyperparameter Mismatch:** The paper states k=5 in Section 4 (Experiment Setup), while the `run_experiments.py` script defaults to `--k 10`. The abstract mentions 'k diverse samples' without specifying the value for the main results. The placeholder image generation script for k-ablation uses k=[1, 5, 10, 20].\nWhile the codebase itself is well-structured and implements the proposed components, the apparent use of placeholder results for the paper's claims is a major flaw."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The problem of quantifying uncertainty and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs is highly significant, as highlighted by the workshop's task description. The proposed SCEC method, being a lightweight inference-time approach, has the potential for considerable impact if its claims were substantiated. However, the critical soundness issues, particularly the evidence that reported results are not from genuine experiments, severely diminish the significance of the current work. If the results were reliable and reproducible, the paper would offer a valuable contribution. The provided codebase is extensive and could serve as a foundation for future, properly conducted research, which lends minor significance. As it stands, the paper does not reliably advance the field."

This makes the paper's empirical claims unreliable.",
