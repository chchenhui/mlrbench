    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The paper demonstrates excellent alignment across its constituent parts and the initial research goals. The abstract, introduction, and methodology consistently build upon the research idea of DSRSQ. The experimental results directly address the objectives outlined in the research proposal, evaluating the DSR, SQA, and RCKV components through relevant metrics and baselines. For instance, the abstract's claims of 'up to 57% memory reduction and 49% higher throughput' are directly substantiated by Table 2 (DSRSQ 1297.63MB vs Standard 2970.93MB is ~56% reduction; DSRSQ 527.36 tokens/s vs Standard 352.75 tokens/s is ~49.5% increase). The F1 score of 0.8478 is also consistently reported. A minor discrepancy exists where the 'full_model' in the ablation study (Table 4) shows slightly different performance (F1 0.8572) than DSRSQ in the main results (Table 1, F1 0.8478); however, the paper acknowledges and provides a plausible explanation for this ('possibly due to fine-tuning specific to that ablation setup'), maintaining overall coherence. The paper's content also strongly aligns with the workshop's themes of efficient long context understanding and sub-quadratic models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is well-written, with a logical structure that follows the standard scientific paper format, making it easy to follow. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and outlines the proposed solution. The methodology section systematically details each component of DSRSQ (DSR, SQA, RCKV, HOF) with supporting equations and explanations. For example, the DSR's bi-encoder architecture and RL optimization are clearly described. The experimental setup and results are presented in an organized manner using tables and references to figures. The analysis section connects the results back to the paper's claims effectively. Minor areas for improvement include more specific descriptions of the 'lightweight query analyzer' in DSR or the 'lightweight clustering algorithm' in SQA, but these do not significantly detract from the overall clarity. The definitions of metrics are generally clear."

    "Completeness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is largely complete in addressing the task description, research idea, and research proposal. All key components of the proposed DSRSQ model are detailed in the methodology and evaluated in the experiments. The experimental setup includes the proposed baselines, metrics (task performance, efficiency, adaptation), and ablation studies. For example, the ablation study in Table 4 effectively demonstrates the contribution of each module (DSR, SQA, RCKV). While the research proposal mentioned several datasets, the paper focuses its core reported results on Natural Questions, which is acceptable for conciseness, with a note that other datasets were part of a broader design. The paper includes sections for related work, methodology, experiments, analysis, conclusion, and references, covering all essential aspects. Some minor implementation details, such as the specific algorithm for the query complexity estimator or the precise formulation of adaptation metrics like 'Information Retention,' could be more explicitly defined for full reproducibility, but the overall coverage is strong."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper's methodology is generally sound, combining established techniques (RL, sparse attention, low-rank projections) in a novel framework. The arguments for improved efficiency and competitive performance are supported by the experimental results presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3. The ablation study (Table 4) provides evidence for the utility of each proposed component. The choice of the Natural Questions dataset and the selected baselines are appropriate for the task. However, there are a few points that temper the soundness: 1. The paper does not report statistical significance tests for its results, which would strengthen the claims of superiority or competitiveness. 2. Some components, like the 'lightweight query analyzer' for DSR or the specific 'lightweight clustering algorithm' for SQA, are not fully specified, making it harder to assess their precise impact and replicate the work. 3. The exact calculation methods for the 'Adaptation Metrics' (Information Retention, Temporal Consistency, Adaptation Speed) are not detailed, making their interpretation and validity somewhat opaque. 4. The 'full_model' in the ablation study having slightly better results than the main 'DSRSQ' model, while explained, could ideally be reconciled or more deeply investigated. Despite these points, the core ideas are robust, and the paper includes a thoughtful 'Limitations' section."
