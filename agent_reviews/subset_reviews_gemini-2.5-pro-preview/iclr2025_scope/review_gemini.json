        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written and structured, with the core idea of MeLPA (Meta-Learned Personalized Adapters) and its components (meta-learned initialization and update mechanism) explained. The introduction motivates the problem effectively, and the related work section attempts to position MeLPA. The methodology section describes the architecture and learning processes with mathematical formulations. However, clarity is significantly hampered by inconsistencies in the presentation of experimental results. For instance, Section 6.2 notes a discrepancy between Figure 2 and Table 1, and the Analysis section (Section 7) further discusses conflicting values for MeLPA's average accuracy between Figure 2 and Table 1, and also between Figure 7 (ablation) and Table 1. The exact nature of the meta-learned update mechanism U(\\\\cdot; \\\\Phi_{update}) is also somewhat vague initially, only later clarified with an example of a meta-learned learning rate. These issues make it difficult for the reader to fully and clearly grasp the empirical performance and contributions."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper proposes MeLPA, a framework that meta-learns both an optimal initialization strategy and an update mechanism for personalized adapter modules in the context of continual adaptation of Foundation Models. While meta-learning for adapter initialization (e.g., Qin et al., 2023, cited) and meta-learning update rules/optimizers are known concepts, the claimed novelty lies in their joint optimization specifically for personalized adapters in a continual learning setting for FMs. The paper states, 'MeLPA distinguishes itself by meta-learning *both* an optimal initialization strategy *and* an efficient update mechanism...'. This combination for the specific problem is an incremental step, building upon existing lines of research. The references include some with future dates (e.g., Zhu et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2024 with a future arXiv ID), which is unusual and might indicate typos or reliance on very nascent concepts. Assuming the core idea of jointly learning initialization and update rules for adapters in CL is the primary contribution, it offers a moderate degree of novelty."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 1,
        "justification": "The soundness of the paper is critically undermined by issues with its experimental validation and reproducibility. \n1. **Non-Reproducible Code:** The provided `run_log.txt` indicates multiple, persistent errors during attempts to run `run_experiments.py`. These errors include `ModuleNotFoundError`, `ValueError: Unsupported base model architecture`, `KeyError` related to module naming, `TypeError` in task generation and model forwarding, and `RuntimeError` concerning gradient computation. These errors suggest the core experimental code is not functional in its provided state.\n2. **Mock Results:** The codebase includes a `generate_results.py` script explicitly designed to 'Generate mock result files for the MeLPA experiment' and 'creates all visualizations and results files for demonstration purposes.' The functions within this script (e.g., `generate_loss_curves`, `generate_accuracy_matrix`, `generate_forgetting_comparison`) directly correspond to the figures (Figures 1-7) presented in the paper. This, coupled with the non-functional experiment script, strongly indicates that the experimental results shown in the paper are likely generated by this mock script and not from actual, successful runs of the described experimental setup.\n3. **Inconsistent Reported Results:** The paper itself acknowledges inconsistencies in its results. For example, Section 6.2 contains a note about Figure 2 having different values for MeLPA compared to Table 1. The Analysis (Section 7) further highlights discrepancies in MeLPA's average accuracy between Figure 2 and Table 1, and also between the ablation study figure (Figure 7) and Table 1. For instance, Table 1 reports MeLPA Avg Acc: 70.23%, BWT: -1.98%, while the text mentions Figure 2 (likely mock) showed MeLPA Avg Acc: 77.4%. The ablation figure (Figure 7, also likely mock) shows full MeLPA with Avg Acc 73.3%, BWT -10.5%, and 'MeLPA (Init Only)' with Avg Acc 89.8%, BWT -4.0%. These conflicting numbers make it impossible to trust the reported findings.\n4. **Experimental Setup Details:** The paper states 100 training examples per task (Section 5.1), but the `run.py` script (used to launch `run_experiments.py` as per the log) defaults to 50 examples per task in `--quick` mode, which was active during the logged runs. While minor, it adds to the list of discrepancies.\nGiven these points, the experimental validation of MeLPA's effectiveness is not sound. The conclusions drawn from such data are unreliable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The paper addresses the problem of efficient continual adaptation of foundation models, which is highly significant and relevant to the themes of the workshop (e.g., scalable optimization, efficient adaptation, mitigating catastrophic forgetting). The proposed MeLPA framework, if validated, could offer a valuable contribution. However, the profound issues with experimental soundness (non-reproducible code, likely use of mock data, and inconsistent reporting) mean that the paper, in its current form, fails to provide credible evidence for its claims. Without reliable and reproducible experimental results, the actual significance of the proposed method cannot be established. While the conceptual idea might be interesting, the lack of empirical backing severely limits its impact on the field. The work is unlikely to have a lasting impact or be built upon by others if the results are not trustworthy."
