        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written and structured. The abstract, introduction, and conclusion clearly articulate the problem (KV cache bottleneck in long-context LLMs), the proposed solution (ATSKV), and its purported contributions. The methodology section describes the three main components (token relevance prediction, adaptive sparsity management, external memory integration) with mathematical formulations (Eq 1-6). The overall structure is logical, progressing from problem statement to solution and experimental validation. However, some specific details could be enhanced for better clarity. For instance, the derivation and components of the attention-derived feature a_i^l (Eq 2) and its integration with other features before the MLP (Eq 3) could be more explicit. The paper mentions projector layers in the code's `TokenRelevancePredictor` which are not detailed in the equations. Furthermore, the process for generating 'ground truth' relevance labels for the supervised pretraining phase of the relevance predictor is crucial but only briefly touched upon in Section 3.4."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper proposes ATSKV, which integrates a learned token-level relevance predictor, an adaptive sparsity mechanism using dynamic quantiles, and an external memory system with LSH-based retrieval. While individual techniques like MLPs for scoring, quantile-based thresholding, and LSH are established, their specific combination and application to achieve dynamic, token-level KV cache sparsity with continuous refinement during inference appears to offer some novelty. The related work section discusses methods like DynamicKV (layer-wise retention), MEDA (layer-wise for multimodal contexts), KVLink (KV cache reuse), and RocketKV (two-stage compression). ATSKV aims to differentiate itself through its fine-grained, learnable token-level relevance prediction and its adaptive nature. The proposed two-phase training (supervised pretraining followed by reinforcement learning fine-tuning) for the relevance predictor, if fully realized and effective, would also contribute to its novelty. However, the field of KV cache optimization is active, and adaptive techniques are common, making the contribution more of a novel combination and refinement rather than a completely groundbreaking approach. The novelty score is tempered by the fact that some components (like the RL fine-tuning) are not fully implemented in the provided code."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 1,
        "justification": "The soundness of this paper is critically undermined by several major issues: \n1. **Experimental Results Appear Fabricated:** The most significant flaw is the strong evidence suggesting that the quantitative experimental results presented in Section 5 (including specific memory savings like '80.3% reduction', accuracy figures like 'within 1% of the full cache', latency/throughput numbers, and all associated Figures 1-16) are not from genuine experiments with the Llama 2 (7B) model as claimed in Section 4.2. The provided `run_experiment.py` script includes a function `generate_mock_results` which creates artificial data for all metrics. The accompanying `log.txt` (entry `2025-05-10 09:33:55,451`) indicates that the experiment script was run with the `--use_api` flag, which triggers this `generate_mock_results` function. This implies the paper's empirical claims are based on mocked data, rendering them unreliable and invalidating the experimental validation.\n2. **Incomplete Implementation of the Proposed Method:** Key aspects of the ATSKV methodology described in the paper are not fully implemented in the provided code: \n    a. **Training Procedure (Section 3.4):** The paper details a two-phase training for the relevance predictor: supervised pretraining followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning. The code (`run_experiment.py -> train_relevance_predictor`) only contains a simplified supervised pretraining (using attention sums as ground truth and MSE loss). The crucial RL fine-tuning component, designed to optimize the policy for performance and memory trade-offs, is entirely missing. \n    b. **External Memory Integration (Section 3.3):** The paper describes a two-tier storage system with mechanisms for promoting KV pairs from passive store to active cache and demoting them. The code (`sparse_kv_cache.py -> ExternalMemoryManager -> migrate_kv_pairs`) implements demotion but explicitly states 'TODO: Implement promotion from external storage,' meaning a critical part of the described external memory system is non-functional.\n3. **Buggy Core Code:** The `test_log.txt` reveals that essential tests for the proposed ATSKV method failed. Specifically, `test_kv_cache_factory` (when creating `atskv`), `test_sparse_kv_cache`, and `test_model_integration` all encountered an error: `'HandcraftedFeatureExtractor' object has no attribute 'to'`. This indicates that the core implementation of ATSKV is buggy and not in a working state as provided, preventing reproducibility or reliable use of the proposed method.\n4. **Unreliable Ablation Studies:** Given that the main experimental results are likely based on mocked data and the method itself is incompletely implemented and buggy, the ablation studies (Section 5.5) cannot be considered reliable. Claims made in this section (e.g., impact of relevance predictor components, effect of external memory) are not substantiated.\n\nThese fundamental issues regarding fabricated results, incomplete core methodology, and buggy code make the paper's conclusions entirely unsupported and unsound."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The problem addressed—optimizing the KV cache for long-context LLMs—is highly significant in the current AI landscape. An effective solution that drastically reduces memory footprint (as claimed, up to 80%) while maintaining performance (claimed <1% accuracy loss) would be a substantial contribution, enabling wider deployment of powerful long-context models, especially in resource-constrained environments, and potentially pushing the boundaries of context length that models can handle. However, the significance of *this specific paper* is severely diminished by its profound soundness issues. Since the experimental results appear to be fabricated and the proposed method (ATSKV) is incompletely implemented and buggy in the provided code, the paper fails to deliver any credible evidence of its claimed contributions. While the ideas presented might have potential, without sound empirical validation and a working implementation, the work in its current state offers negligible practical or scientific significance. The score is not 1 only because the problem statement and conceptual direction are relevant."
