        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written and structured. The introduction clearly motivates the problem of quadratic complexity in transformers due to KV caches. The proposed method, involving attention-guided pruning, online k-means clustering, and distillation, is broken down into logical components in Section 3. Equations for token importance (Eq. 1), k-means update (Eq. 2), and distillation loss (Eq. 3) are provided. The contributions are explicitly listed. The structure (Intro, Related Work, Method, Experiments, Analysis, Conclusion) is standard and easy to follow. However, the exact mechanism of 'on-the-fly' compression, especially during autoregressive generation (e.g., how it integrates with Hugging Face's `generate` loop step-by-step), could be more detailed. The paper mentions 'per‐token cost is O(Bd + Kd)', implying step-wise application, but the code's integration with `generate` isn't fully clear from `TransformerWithCompression.py`."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper combines several techniques: attention-based token importance scoring, pruning, online k-means for summarization of KV pairs, and knowledge distillation. While individual components like attention scoring or distillation are not new, their specific application and combination for KV cache compression appear to offer novelty. Using online k-means to create a 'low‐rank summary' of the retained KV pairs (Section 3.4) is a distinct aspect compared to some other pruning or selection methods. The joint fine-tuning with a distillation objective to align the compressed model with a full-cache teacher is a sensible approach to mitigate performance degradation. The differentiation from related works (ZACK, DynamicKV, etc.) in Section 2 highlights these combined aspects as its unique contribution."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 1,
        "justification": "The soundness of the paper is critically undermined by the experimental validation. \n1. Experimental Results vs. Simulation: The provided code includes `simulated_results.py`. The figures referenced in Section 5 of the paper (Figure 1: Latency vs Sequence Length, Figure 2: Throughput Comparison, Figure 3: Memory Usage Comparison, Figure 4: Memory Scaling, Figure 5: Performance Trade-off) directly correspond to plots generated by this script. This script uses predefined mathematical functions with added noise (e.g., `baseline_time_per_token = [0.1 * (seq_len / 128) for seq_len in sequence_lengths]`) rather than actual model execution.\n2. Execution Logs (`log.txt`): The logs show `evaluate.py` (the script intended for actual experiments) failing or encountering errors (e.g., 'Dataset ... doesn't exist', 'ZACKCompressor.forward() got an unexpected keyword argument'). Conversely, `simulated_results.py` runs successfully, generating the figures and a `results.md` file that mirrors the paper's claims.\n3. Reliability of Claims: Consequently, the quantitative claims in the paper (e.g., '2–5× speedups, and 65–90% memory reduction with <1% perplexity increase', 'near‐linear per‐token latency scaling') are based on these simulations, not empirical evidence from the proposed method. The '<1% perplexity increase' claim is particularly concerning as the simulation script does not model language quality, and the actual evaluation script failed.\n4. Code Implementation: The KV cache handling in `TransformerWithCompression.py` (e.g., `_extract_kv_caches`) is a simplification and may not correctly integrate with Hugging Face's standard `generate` method for 'on-the-fly' compression. The `evaluate.py` script also shows errors with baselines, making comparisons unreliable.\n5. Visualization Figures: The figures in the paper are confirmed to be from `simulated_results.py` and thus do not represent real experimental outcomes of the described algorithm. This discrepancy between presented results and reproducible experimental validation is a major flaw."

        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The problem of efficient long-context inference and KV cache management is highly significant and aligns with the workshop's themes. A method achieving the paper's claimed results (substantial speedups and memory reduction with minimal performance loss) would be very impactful. However, the significance of the *presented work* is severely diminished due to the critical soundness issues. Since the experimental results appear to be simulated rather than empirically verified through the provided codebase, the actual demonstrated impact and reliability of the proposed method are highly questionable. While the ideas might hold promise, their practical significance is not substantiated by the current evidence, making the work's potential impact on the field uncertain without valid empirical backing."
