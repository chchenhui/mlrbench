    "Consistency": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The paper is largely consistent in its internal structure, following the research idea and proposal from problem statement to methodology. However, there are significant inconsistencies: 1. Between the ambitious 'Expected Outcome' (50% reduction in manual tactic writing from the research idea/proposal) and the actual reported result (0.08% in Table 1). The paper's Analysis section acknowledges this gap. 2. Regarding the ablation study: The separate 'Experimental Results' document claims RL and retrieval 'contribute significantly,' but Table 2 in the main paper shows *no difference* in performance when these components are removed for the reported metrics. The paper's own Analysis section (Section 7) correctly highlights this discrepancy with its *own* Table 2, stating the numerical data does not reflect a significant contribution. This self-correction is positive, but the inconsistency regarding the components' impact is a core issue. 3. The 0.00% Tactic Accuracy for methods achieving 100% Proof Completion Rate is consistently reported across LLM methods but creates internal tension, suggesting a mismatch between the metric's intent and the observed outcomes, which the paper also discusses."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written, with a clear structure (Abstract, Introduction, Related Work, Methodology, Experiments, Analysis, Conclusion) that is easy to follow. The arguments for the proposed LLM-TAC framework are presented logically. Mathematical notations in the methodology are adequately explained. The main challenge to clarity arises not from the writing itself, but from the experimental results (e.g., 0.00% Tactic Accuracy with 100% Proof Completion, 0.00s completion times, and identical ablation study results), which are counterintuitive. The Analysis section attempts to clarify these puzzling results, but their inherent nature can leave the reader with questions."

    "Completeness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper addresses the core aspects of the task description, research idea, and research proposal, covering the proposed methodology and experimental setup. It includes sections for related work, methodology, experimental results, analysis, and conclusion. However, there are areas of incompleteness: 1. The actual figures (visualizations of results) are represented by placeholders (e.g., `![Metrics Comparison](metrics_comparison.png)`) and are not rendered, making a full assessment of the visual data presentation impossible. 2. Details about the specific Coq benchmark dataset used are somewhat high-level; more characterization regarding its size, complexity, and source would enhance reproducibility and understanding. 3. The calculation method for the 'Reduction in Manual Tactic Writing' metric is not explicitly detailed. 4. While the paper mentions fine-tuning the LLM, specifics about the fine-tuning dataset and process are limited. The paper does report on most planned experiments, though the goal of evaluating on large libraries like 'mathcomp' and 'stdlib' is noted as 'ongoing work'."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposed LLM-TAC methodology (contextual encoding, LLM-based generation, RL loop) is conceptually plausible and aligns with current research directions. However, the soundness of the empirical validation and the conclusions drawn are significantly undermined by several factors: 1. The experimental benchmark seems insufficiently challenging or appropriately chosen, as evidenced by 0.00s completion times for all methods and 100% proof completion rates for LLM-based approaches. This makes it difficult to meaningfully differentiate methods or assess the impact of specific components. 2. The 'Tactic Accuracy' metric yielding 0.00% for methods that solve 100% of problems is highly problematic. It suggests the metric is either flawed, its definition is too stringent, or the LLMs are succeeding via mechanisms not captured as 'accurate' tactics, obscuring how proofs are actually found. 3. The ablation study results (Table 2), which show no change in performance upon removing the Reinforcement Learning or Retrieval components, fail to provide empirical support for the utility of these key designed elements of LLM-TAC for the reported metrics and benchmark. The paper's Analysis section acknowledges this lack of observed impact. 4. The extremely low 'Reduction in Manual Writing' (0.08%) does not substantiate claims of significant practical automation. While the paper's honest discussion of these limitations in Section 7 is a strength, it highlights fundamental weaknesses in the current experimental evidence supporting the framework's efficacy."
