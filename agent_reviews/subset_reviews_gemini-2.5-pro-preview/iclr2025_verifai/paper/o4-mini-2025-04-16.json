        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The paper exhibits significant inconsistencies. A major contradiction exists between the reported 0.00 Tactic Accuracy for LLM-based methods and their 100% Proof Completion Rate, which is not adequately resolved. The expected 50% reduction in manual tactic writing from the research idea/proposal contrasts sharply with the achieved 0.08%; this discrepancy is reported, but its implications, especially relative to baselines (where Naive LLM performs better at 0.12%), are not fully explored or highlighted. Experimental results for completion times in Table 1 (0.00s) are inconsistent with the visual representation in Figure 2 (showing non-zero times, assuming the provided image 'metrics_comparison_time.png' corresponds to Figure 2). Furthermore, claims in the analysis about the criticality of RL and retrieval components are not supported by the ablation study data (Table 2), which shows identical performance on key metrics (Tactic Accuracy, Proof Completion Rate, Reduction in Manual Writing) when these components are removed. The abstract's claim of '0.00 tactic accuracy improvement over naïve LLMs' is technically true if both are 0.00, but this masks the underlying issue of zero reported accuracy. The paper also doesn't reconcile LLM-TAC's 0.08% reduction in manual writing with Naive LLM's superior 0.12%."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "While the paper is structurally organized (Abstract, Introduction, etc.), its clarity is severely hampered by the unexplained and contradictory core results, particularly the 0.00 Tactic Accuracy coexisting with 100% Proof Completion for LLM-based methods. The definition and implications of 'Tactic Generation Accuracy' yielding zero for methods that successfully complete proofs are not made clear, making it difficult for the reader to understand the actual performance in tactic generation. The abstract's phrasing '0.00 tactic accuracy improvement over naïve LLMs' is awkward and potentially misleading about the baseline's performance. The analysis section fails to clearly address why LLM-TAC performs worse than simpler baselines (Naive LLM, ICL) on the 'Reduction in Manual Writing' metric. Arguments about the importance of RL and retrieval are not clearly supported by the presented data for the main metrics, leading to confusion regarding their actual contribution."

    "Completeness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The paper is incomplete in several critical areas. A convincing and detailed explanation for the 0.00 Tactic Accuracy alongside 100% Proof Completion is fundamentally missing. Details regarding the specific LLM architecture (e.g., base model, number of parameters), size, and training specifics for fine-tuning and RL are sparse, hindering reproducibility. Information on the 'Naïve LLM' and 'In-Context Learning' baselines (e.g., which LLM was used, what were the few-shot examples or prompts) is insufficient. The 'Traditional Tactics' baseline is vaguely described as 'Coq’s built-in auto, lia, etc.' without specifying which tactics were used or how they were applied. The mechanism of 'counter-examples for contrastive training' is mentioned but not elaborated upon. The significant underachievement of the 0.08% reduction in manual writing compared to the 50% target from the research idea/proposal (and its inferiority to baselines) is not deeply analyzed or discussed. The paper also omits a discussion on why LLM-TAC is outperformed by Naive LLM in reduction of manual writing."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The soundness of the paper is highly questionable. The central finding of 0.00 Tactic Accuracy for methods that achieve 100% proof completion suggests a fundamental issue with the metric itself, its measurement, its reporting, or its interpretation; this makes it difficult to assess the actual tactic generation capability of the proposed LLM-TAC. The claim in the analysis that 'both retrieval and RL components are critical' is directly contradicted by the ablation study results (Table 2), which show no change in Tactic Accuracy, Proof Completion Rate, or Reduction in Manual Writing when these components are removed. The inconsistency in reported completion times (Table 1 reports 0.00s for all methods, while Figure 2, based on 'metrics_comparison_time.png', shows varied, non-zero times) raises serious concerns about data reliability and carefulness. The methodology's claimed success is further challenged by LLM-TAC achieving a lower reduction in manual writing (0.08%) than the simpler Naive LLM baseline (0.12%), a critical comparative result that undermines the practical benefits of the more complex LLM-TAC framework and is not adequately addressed in the analysis."
