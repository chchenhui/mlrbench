        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written and structured, with the abstract, introduction, and methodology being mostly clear. However, some specific details in the methodology, such as the training and data requirements for the 'Semi-Supervised Concept Anchoring' probes, could be more thoroughly explained. The clarity of the experimental reporting is severely undermined by the soundness issues, as the presented results do not seem to stem from the described experimental process."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper proposes 'Concept-Graph Explanations,' which combines probing internal LLM states, mapping these to concepts (using a hybrid of semi-supervised, unsupervised, and LLM-aided methods), and constructing a graph. While concept-based and graph-based explanations exist, their specific application and the three-phase methodology for LLM reasoning chains offer some novelty. The approach is more of an engineering contribution, combining existing ideas, rather than a fundamentally new theoretical breakthrough. It represents an incremental step over token-level attributions and raw CoT outputs by aiming for higher-level structured explanations."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 1,
        "justification": "The soundness of the paper is critically flawed. Firstly, the provided code is not reproducible; the `run_log.txt` shows a fatal `ImportError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package` in `experiments/experiment_runner.py`, preventing the main experimental script (`run_experiments.py`) from executing. Secondly, and more critically, the experimental results (figures and tables in Section 6) appear to be fabricated or, at best, not generated from the described experimental methodology using the provided code. The script `utils/create_example_visualizations.py` contains functions that hardcode the exact data for Table 1 (Success Rates), Table 2 (Method Comparison metrics like num_nodes, num_edges for 'concept_graph' and 'cot'), and generate figures with names matching those in the paper (e.g., `success_rates.png`, `methods_comparison.png`, `concept_graph_example.png`). This indicates that the presented results are not from genuine experiments with the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model as claimed but are simulated or predefined. This makes all experimental claims and analyses unreliable and invalid."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The paper addresses LLM interpretability, which is a significant and relevant problem for the workshop theme of 'Building Trust in Language Models and Applications.' If the proposed method were sound and its results genuine, it could offer a valuable contribution. However, due to the critical soundness issues (non-reproducible code and strong evidence of fabricated results), the actual contribution of this paper is negligible or even negative. Unreliable research does not advance the field and can mislead other researchers. Therefore, despite tackling an important problem, the work in its current state has no positive impact."
