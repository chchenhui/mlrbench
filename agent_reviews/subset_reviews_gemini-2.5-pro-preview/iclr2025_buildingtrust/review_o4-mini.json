        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written and structured. The introduction clearly outlines the problem and the proposed contributions. The methodology section describes the four main stages of the proposed 'Cluster-Driven Certified Unlearning' framework with mathematical formulations. However, a significant lack of clarity arises from the discrepancy between the described experimental setup (GPT-2 Small on WebText) and the actual source of the reported results (a toy model for the proposed method, and hardcoded values for baselines and other experiments, as indicated by the provided code). The definition and implications of the very low KFR values could also be explained more clearly."

        "justification": "The paper proposes a multi-stage unlearning framework that combines several techniques: hierarchical spectral clustering of hidden activations, influence score approximation for identifying affected clusters, targeted low-rank gradient surgery in cluster subspaces, and Fisher-information-based certification. While individual components (spectral clustering, influence functions, LoRA-like updates, Fisher information) are known, their specific combination and application to certified LLM unlearning, particularly the idea of operating on semantically coherent clusters identified in the activation space, presents a novel approach. The emphasis on providing statistical certification for unlearning is also a valuable direction."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 1,
        "justification": "The soundness of the paper is critically undermined by the experimental results. The provided code reveals that: \n1. The primary results for the 'Cluster-Driven' method reported in Table 1 (KFR 0.0472, KRR 0.9987, Perplexity 6.9136, Compute Time 1.08s) are generated by `run_minimal_experiment.py`. This script uses a `ToyLanguageModel` (1-layer transformer, vocab size 1000, hidden size 32) and a very simplistic unlearning method (gradient ascent on deletion data), not the sophisticated method described in the paper's methodology, nor GPT-2 Small on WebText as claimed in Section 4 and the abstract. \n2. The results for baselines in Table 1, sequential unlearning in Table 2, and deletion-set size impact in Table 3 appear to be hardcoded within the `simulate_all_experiments.py` script (in the `merge_all_results` function), rather than being genuinely produced by running the respective algorithms. This suggests fabrication of results. \n3. The reported Knowledge Forgetting Rate (KFR) is extremely low (e.g., 0.0472 for the proposed method), indicating that only about 4.7% of the targeted information is forgotten, which is practically ineffective. \n4. The perplexity values in Table 1 (around 6.9-7.0) are inconsistent with typical GPT-2 Small performance on WebText and correspond to the loss from the toy model. \n5. The visualizations (Figures 1 and 2) are also generated by `run_minimal_experiment.py` and reflect the toy model's performance. \n6. Some references have future dates (e.g., arXiv:2502.11190), a common artifact in generated text. \nThese issues indicate that the experimental validation is not reliable and does not support the paper's claims about the proposed method's performance on LLMs like GPT-2."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The problem of machine unlearning for LLMs is highly significant due to privacy regulations (like GDPR), the need to remove copyrighted or harmful content, and to correct outdated information. A method that could achieve efficient, effective, and certifiable unlearning would be a major contribution. The paper attempts to address this important problem. However, due to the severe soundness issues, including misleading experimental results and extremely poor unlearning effectiveness (very low KFR), the work as presented does not make a credible contribution to the field. If the method were sound and effective, its significance would be high, but the current evidence suggests otherwise."
