        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The paper is poorly written due to major inconsistencies between its sections. The abstract and introduction claim the method preserves utility ('matching baseline accuracy'), but the results section reports a test accuracy of 0.00 for all methods, a direct contradiction. The methodology described (e.g., influence functions to identify samples, replay sets) is not fully implemented in the provided code, which uses a hard-coded target and no replay set. Furthermore, Figure 1 is presented as a blank image, which severely undermines the paper's clarity and professionalism."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The paper claims novelty in combining influence functions, gradient projection, and replay-regularized fine-tuning. However, the core 'Influence-Driven' component, which is central to the paper's framing, is not implemented in the provided code. The implemented technique is a form of constrained fine-tuning via gradient projection, which is an existing concept. Therefore, the demonstrated contribution is minimal and incremental, and the paper fails to substantiate its primary claims of novelty."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 1,
        "justification": "The paper is fundamentally unsound due to multiple critical flaws. 1) There is a severe discrepancy between the paper's claims and the provided code; the paper states it uses GPT-2 Medium (345M) while the code uses DistilBERT-base (~66M), and key methodological components like influence functions and replay sets are absent from the code. 2) The experimental results are not credible. A test accuracy of 0.00 on SST2 is statistically improbable and suggests either fabricated data or a catastrophic, unacknowledged bug. 3) The baseline used is the model *before* unlearning, not a properly retrained model, which makes the comparison meaningless for evaluating unlearning efficacy. 4) The conclusions are entirely unsupported by the data presented. The results are not reliable and cannot be trusted."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The paper addresses the important and timely problem of machine unlearning for trustworthy AI. However, its contribution is insignificant due to the profound methodological and experimental flaws. The proposed method fails to deliver on its promises, and the reported results are not reliable or reproducible as described. The work provides no meaningful insights or validated techniques for the research community and is unlikely to have any positive impact on the field."
