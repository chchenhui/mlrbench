        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The paper is exceptionally well-written, with a logical structure and clear, concise language. The core concept of the Dynamic Policy Enforcer (DPE), the two-LLM architecture, and the training methodology are explained very clearly. The abstract and introduction effectively set up the problem and the proposed solution. Figures and tables are well-designed and easy to understand, directly supporting the text. The authors are also transparent about limitations in the analysis section."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper presents a practical and well-motivated engineering solution rather than a fundamentally new scientific concept. The idea of using an LLM to guardrail another is not new, as the related work section acknowledges. However, the specific contribution—using a small, parameter-efficiently fine-tuned LLM to interpret natural language policies at inference time for low-latency enforcement—is a novel and valuable combination of existing techniques. It addresses a practical gap between slow, powerful LLM judges and brittle, static guardrails. The novelty is incremental but relevant."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The paper's soundness is severely compromised by its experimental design and evaluation, despite the commendable reproducibility of the code. The reported numbers in the paper are consistent with the provided code and result files (`dpe_results.json`, `baseline_results.json`). However, there are critical flaws: 1. The central claim of 'dynamic' adaptation to new policies is not tested. The paper's limitation section admits this, stating the benchmark 'did not yet include the 'differential' test cases designed to explicitly measure dynamic adaptation'. This is a major disconnect between the paper's title/promise and its execution. 2. The evaluation is conducted on an extremely small test set of only 6 examples (as per the 80/20 split on a 30-item dataset). 3. The analysis of the results is misleading. The paper highlights a high F1-score of 0.80 for the 'BLOCK' class. However, the `dpe_results.json` file shows that the model achieved this by predicting 'BLOCK' for all 6 test samples, including two that were 'ALLOW'. This means the model had 0% recall for the 'ALLOW' class, a critical failure that is not discussed. This is not a 'practical balance' but a biased model. 4. The dataset was generated and evaluated (for the LLM-as-Judge baseline) by the same model family (`gpt-4o-mini`), which can lead to inflated baseline scores and questions the dataset's diversity."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The problem of creating adaptive, low-overhead safety guardrails is highly significant for the field of trustworthy AI. The proposed DPE framework, if proven effective, would be a significant contribution. However, the paper's impact is severely limited by its unsound experimental validation. The claims of effectiveness and adaptability are not supported by the provided evidence. Due to the flawed evaluation on a tiny dataset and the failure to test the core 'dynamic' aspect, the current results are not reliable and do not convincingly demonstrate the value of the proposed method. The work is a promising proof-of-concept but does not yet have a significant impact."
