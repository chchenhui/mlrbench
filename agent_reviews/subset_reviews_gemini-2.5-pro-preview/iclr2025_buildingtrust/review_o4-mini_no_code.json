        "justification": "The paper is generally well-structured with standard sections (Introduction, Related Work, Methodology, Experiments, Analysis, Conclusion). The core ideas of the proposed 'Cluster-Driven Certified Unlearning' framework, involving representation clustering, influence-score approximation, targeted gradient surgery, and Fisher certification, are articulated. However, significant clarity issues exist: \n1. The primary metric, Knowledge Forgetting Rate (KFR), is defined as 'fraction of targeted information removed' with an arrow indicating higher is better. The reported KFR values (e.g., 0.0472) are extremely low, suggesting only 4-5% of information is removed. If this interpretation is correct, the method's effectiveness is poorly communicated or inherently low. If KFR has a different meaning, it's not clearly explained. \n2. The abstract mentions 'perplexity Δ ≤ 2%', but Table 1 reports absolute perplexity values without stating the original model's perplexity, making it hard to verify this delta. \n3. Figure 1 ('Comparison of Original and Unlearned Models') incorrectly assigns a KFR value to the 'Original Model' and shows KRR for the unlearned model as 1.0, which contradicts Table 1 (0.9987). The meaning of 'Deletion Loss' could also be clearer. \n4. The description of Figure 2 ('Unlearning Performance (KFR vs. KRR)') claims it 'plots KFR vs. KRR across methods, illustrating the superior Pareto-front', but the provided image shows only a single data point for the proposed method and two arbitrary dashed lines, failing to support the textual claim. This is a major discrepancy. \n5. The compute times reported (e.g., 1.08s for GPT-2 Small) seem very low for the described operations and lack context regarding what exactly is being timed (e.g., full pipeline vs. just the update step)."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper proposes a multi-stage unlearning framework that combines several known techniques in a specific pipeline for LLMs: hierarchical spectral clustering of hidden activations, influence scores for identifying affected clusters, low-rank gradient surgery within these specific cluster subspaces, and Fisher-information-based certification. While individual components (spectral clustering, influence functions, LoRA-like updates, Fisher information for KL divergence) are not new, their integrated application to achieve certified, targeted unlearning by operating on semantically clustered subspaces of model representations appears to offer a degree of novelty. The paper positions this approach as distinct from prior work by emphasizing the cluster-level decomposition, subspace-specific interventions, and formal certification. However, if the method's effectiveness (KFR) is as low as the results suggest, the practical novelty of the solution is diminished."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The methodological components are theoretically plausible. However, the experimental validation and reporting exhibit critical flaws: \n1. Extremely Low KFR: The reported KFR values (e.g., 0.0472 in Table 1) are alarmingly low if KFR means 'fraction of targeted information removed'. This suggests the method is largely ineffective at its primary goal, undermining all other claims. \n2. Misleading Figure 2: The description of Figure 2 (KFR vs. KRR Pareto-front) is entirely inconsistent with the provided image, which shows only a single data point for the proposed method and no comparison or Pareto-front. This is a severe misrepresentation of experimental results and raises concerns about the integrity of the visualisations. \n3. Inconsistencies in Figure 1: Figure 1 presents KFR for the 'Original Model', which is conceptually incorrect, and the KRR value for the unlearned model appears inconsistent with Table 1. \n4. Counter-intuitive Results: Table 3 shows KFR decreasing with larger deletion-set sizes (e.g., from 0.0492 for 10 items to 0.0380 for 1000 items). This is counter-intuitive (expecting it to be harder, or for the method to maintain effectiveness) and is not adequately explained, suggesting a potential limitation or flaw in the method's scalability or the metric's behavior. \n5. Suspicious Compute Times: The reported compute time of 1.08s for unlearning on GPT-2 Small seems exceptionally fast for a pipeline involving clustering, influence score approximation (potentially involving Hessian-vector products), and gradient surgery. The paper does not clarify what this time encompasses, making it difficult to assess the claimed efficiency ('>60% reduction compared to full fine-tuning'). \n6. Future-Dated References: Several references are to arXiv preprints with future dates (e.g., 2025), which is a common artifact in AI-generated text and indicates a lack of careful preparation or review. \n7. No Code: The absence of code makes it impossible to verify the implementation details or reproduce the results, which is crucial given the other concerns. \nOverall, the experimental results as presented do not convincingly support the paper's claims, and Figure 2 is a major flaw."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The paper addresses the problem of machine unlearning for LLMs, which is of high significance for privacy (e.g., GDPR's 'right to be forgotten'), safety, and building trust in AI systems. A method that allows efficient, targeted, and certified removal of information from LLMs would be a valuable contribution to the field. The inclusion of a certification mechanism is particularly relevant. However, the significance of this specific work is severely hampered by its apparent lack of effectiveness, as suggested by the very low KFR values. If the method only removes a tiny fraction of the targeted information, its practical utility and impact are minimal, regardless of efficiency or certification. The issues with experimental reporting (especially Figure 2) also undermine the credibility of the contributions. While the problem is important, the proposed solution, based on the presented evidence, does not appear to offer a significant advancement."
