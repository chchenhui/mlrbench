    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper demonstrates strong consistency across its sections, aligning well with the research idea, experimental results, and the overall task description of addressing spurious correlations without group labels. The methodology presented is a direct and clear implementation of the AIFS concept. While the initial research proposal contained less refined mathematical formulations for some components (e.g., sensitivity loss, invariance loss), the paper provides improved and internally consistent definitions, which are then used effectively throughout the work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The paper is exceptionally clear and well-structured, making it easy to understand the proposed AIFS method and its contributions. The writing is precise, arguments are presented logically, and mathematical notations are used effectively. The breakdown of the methodology into components and the adaptive loop is particularly helpful. The figures (as described in the text and provided externally) effectively visualize the results."

    "Completeness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is largely complete, addressing all critical aspects of the research including motivation, related work, a detailed methodology, experimental setup, results, analysis, and limitations. It successfully translates the research idea and proposal into a full paper. The experimental validation, while focused on specific benchmarks, is sufficient to demonstrate the method's potential. A minor point of incompleteness is a placeholder citation for the DANN baseline in Section 4.2."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The AIFS methodology is sound, offering a plausible and well-reasoned approach to tackling spurious correlations through adaptive latent space interventions. The experimental design is appropriate, utilizing standard benchmarks, relevant baselines, and suitable evaluation metrics. The reported results provide strong empirical support for the paper's claims, particularly the improvements in worst-group accuracy and reduction in disparity. Limitations are thoughtfully discussed. The core arguments are well-supported by the presented evidence and reasoning."
