    "Consistency": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper generally aligns with the task description, research idea, and proposal. The raw experimental data in Table 1 is consistent with the separate experimental results document. However, there are significant inconsistencies and errors in how quantitative improvements are reported. Section 6 of the paper and the experimental results summary incorrectly report absolute differences in Worst Group Accuracy and Disparity as percentage improvements (e.g., '18.16%' WGA improvement, which is the absolute difference 0.7852-0.6036=0.1816). Section 7 correctly calculates the WGA percentage improvement as ~30.1%. This discrepancy in both value and calculation method for key results constitutes a notable inconsistency in presenting the findings' magnitude."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper's core concepts are generally well-explained, and the structure is logical. However, clarity is significantly hampered by the erroneous reporting of percentage improvements in Section 6 and the experimental results summary, where absolute changes are presented as percentages. This can mislead the reader about the magnitude of the findings. While Section 7 presents a correct percentage for WGA, the inconsistency itself is confusing. The methodology's loss function derivation, transitioning from a general three-term loss to the final two-term loss, could also be more direct for improved clarity. Assuming figures are as described, their absence in the provided text is a format limitation."

    "Completeness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper covers the main aspects of the research idea and proposal, including motivation, methodology, experiments, and analysis. It addresses the core task of proposing a robustification method that doesn't rely on group labels. However, it lacks some specific implementation details crucial for reproducibility, such as the exact architecture of the intervention module, precise parameters for perturbations (e.g., noise variance, proportion of features shuffled), the specific gradient attribution method used, and the encoder details for the reported experiments. While figures are referenced, their content is not fully elaborated in the text, and ablation studies are not present, though the latter might be for future work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The core methodological idea of adaptive latent interventions (AIFS) is innovative and appears sound for tackling spurious correlations without supervision. The experimental design, including baselines and evaluation metrics, is appropriate. The raw experimental data in Table 1 strongly support the claim of improved Worst Group Accuracy. However, the soundness of the analysis presented in Section 6 and the experimental results summary is compromised by the incorrect calculation and interpretation of percentage improvements (reporting absolute changes as percentages). While Section 7 provides a correct percentage for WGA, this error in other parts indicates a weakness in the analytical rigor of the presentation. More explicit details on baseline configurations (confirming if/how group labels were used for Group DRO, DANN, Reweighting) would further solidify comparative claims of AIFS's label-free advantage."
