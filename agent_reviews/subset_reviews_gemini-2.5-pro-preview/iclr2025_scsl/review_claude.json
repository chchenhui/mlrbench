        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written and structured. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and outlines the proposed CIMRL framework with its three key components. The methodology section describes these components (contrastive invariance, modality disentanglement, intervention-based fine-tuning) in reasonable detail. The overall narrative is easy to follow. However, some operational details, particularly regarding the automated identification of spurious features and the subsequent intervention process in Section 3.4, could be more explicit to fully assess their general applicability without prior knowledge. The figures and tables are presented in a way that is easy to understand, assuming they accurately represent the described method's performance."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed CIMRL framework, which combines contrastive invariance, modality disentanglement, and intervention-based fine-tuning to mitigate shortcut learning in multi-modal models *without requiring explicit annotation of spurious features*, presents a novel approach. While individual techniques like contrastive learning or intervention have been explored, their specific combination and application to multi-modal shortcut learning, with an emphasis on avoiding explicit spurious feature labels, is the main novel contribution. The modality disentanglement component aiming to separate shared causal features from modality-specific spurious ones is also an interesting and relatively novel direction in this context. If the method worked as described and was validated, it would be a notable contribution."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 1,
        "justification": "The paper suffers from a critical flaw in soundness: the experimental results presented (Table 1, Figures 1-4) do not evaluate the CIMRL method described in Section 3 (Methodology). The code analysis reveals that these results were generated by `demo.py`, which uses a `SimpleCIMLRModel`. This demo model lacks all three core components of the proposed CIMRL: (1) the contrastive invariance mechanism with perturbed inputs and its associated loss (\\mathcal{L}_{CI}), (2) the modality disentanglement component's orthogonality loss (\\mathcal{L}_{ortho}), and (3) the intervention-based fine-tuning mechanism (\\mathcal{L}_{IF}). The actual CIMRL method, as described in the paper and implemented in `models/cimrl.py`, includes these components. Therefore, the experiments reported in the paper evaluate a significantly simplified, different model, rendering the conclusions about the proposed CIMRL's efficacy (or lack thereof, as it underperformed the baseline) entirely unsupported and misleading. The figures, while generated from 'real' code (`demo.py`), are 'fake' in the sense that they do not represent the performance of the method the paper claims to introduce and evaluate. This fundamental mismatch between the described methodology and the experimental validation makes the paper's findings unreliable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The problem of mitigating shortcut learning in multi-modal models, especially without requiring explicit annotations of spurious features, is highly significant and relevant to the workshop's themes. The ideas presented in the CIMRL framework (contrastive invariance, modality disentanglement, intervention-based fine-tuning) are potentially valuable. However, due to the critical soundness issue (the experiments do not evaluate the proposed method), the paper currently fails to provide any credible evidence for its contributions. The reported experimental results are unreliable for assessing the actual CIMRL method. Consequently, the paper, in its current state, has minimal significant impact. If the *actual* CIMRL method were rigorously evaluated and shown to be effective, its significance could be much higher."
