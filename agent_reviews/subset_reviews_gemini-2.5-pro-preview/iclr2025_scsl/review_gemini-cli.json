        "justification": "The paper is well-written, with a logical structure that clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental setup. The introduction effectively motivates the need for parameter-efficient robustness methods for foundation models. The methodology section explains the dual-adapter architecture and the concept of orthogonal gradient projection in an intuitive manner. A major strength is the honest and direct discussion of the negative results in the analysis and conclusion sections. However, there are minor issues, such as citing papers with future dates (e.g., 2025), and a subtle but critical ambiguity in the mathematical description of the spurious direction gradient which does not seem to match the provided code's implementation."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The core idea of integrating an orthogonal gradient projection mechanism into a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework to explicitly combat spurious correlations is novel. While prior work has explored gradient projection for disentanglement and PEFT for adaptation, the specific combination in the form of Spurious-Correlation-Aware Adapters (SCA-Adapters) is an original contribution. The concept of training a dedicated 'spurious' adapter to identify a harmful gradient direction and then nullifying this direction for a 'task' adapter is a creative approach to the problem. It represents a notable, though not groundbreaking, advance over existing methods that typically require full model retraining or group-annotated data."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The paper's soundness is severely undermined by multiple critical flaws. \n1. **Implementation-Methodology Mismatch:** There is a fundamental bug in the implementation of the core method. The paper's methodology (Section 4.3) states that the spurious direction gradient, `g_spurious_dir`, should be calculated using the spurious loss: `∇_φ_task L_spurious(C_spurious(...))`. However, the provided code (`run_experiment.py`) calculates this gradient using the task loss: `loss_fn(task_logits_from_spurious, ...)`, where `task_logits` are produced by the task classifier `C_task`. This means the projection is based on an incorrectly defined direction, invalidating the entire experimental validation of the proposed method. \n2. **Unreliable Baselines:** The LoRA baseline's performance is suspiciously poor, with an average accuracy of 0.308, which is significantly worse than the zero-shot performance of 0.745. This suggests that the baseline was not properly tuned, making any comparison against it unreliable. \n3. **Contradictory Reporting:** The `generate_results_md` function in the provided code contains a hardcoded conclusion stating that the method 'achieved a higher Worst-Group Accuracy than standard LoRA', which directly contradicts the results presented in the paper's Table 1 (WGA of 0.0) and the generated plots. This indicates a severe lack of diligence in the research process. \n4. **Inconsistent Details:** The paper claims to use Grad-CAM for saliency maps, but the code implements a simpler Saliency method (input gradients). While the results in Table 1 appear to be 'real' outputs from the flawed code, they do not represent a valid test of the paper's proposed hypothesis. The conclusions drawn are therefore based on an invalid experiment."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The paper addresses a problem of high significance: efficiently making large foundation models robust to spurious correlations. A successful solution would have a major impact. The paper's contribution, however, is minimal due to its unsound experimental basis. It presents a negative result (WGA of 0.0), which could have been significant if it were a true failure of the proposed idea. Instead, it is a failure of a flawed implementation. The paper's analysis correctly identifies the difficulty of automatic shortcut detection as a challenge, but it misses the more fundamental implementation bug in its own orthogonal projection logic. Therefore, the work serves more as a cautionary tale about implementation errors than a meaningful scientific contribution to understanding or solving spurious correlations."
