        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written and structured. The problem of spurious correlations and the proposed LASS framework are explained in an understandable manner. The introduction clearly motivates the work, and the methodology outlines the three phases of LASS. However, clarity is reduced by a few points: 1) The paper is not fully transparent in the main experimental sections (Sections 6) that the LLM's hypothesis generation was simulated in the presented experiment; this is crucial for understanding the current validation status of the 'LLM-Driven' aspect. 2) There's an inconsistency in the reported Worst-Group Accuracy (WGA): Figure 1 (bottom-right) suggests WGA is 1.0 for ERM and LASS, while Figure 2 and the analysis in Section 7 state that two groups have 0.0 accuracy, implying a WGA of 0.0. The paper's textual analysis follows the WGA=0.0 interpretation, which this review also adopts, but the conflicting figure element is confusing."

        "justification": "The core idea of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the discovery of *unknown* spurious correlations by analyzing model error patterns is novel and promising. The proposed LASS framework, which combines LLM-driven hypothesis generation with human validation and targeted interventions in an interactive loop, presents a novel approach. While prior works have used LLMs for analyzing or mitigating known biases (e.g., SpurLens, work by Zhou et al. 2023), LASS's focus on an error-driven discovery of previously unidentified spurious features and its iterative nature distinguishes it. The paper effectively positions LASS against existing methods that often require group annotations or assume certain structures."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The conceptual methodology of LASS is plausible. However, the experimental soundness is critically undermined by several factors: \n1. **LLM Simulation:** The central claim of 'LLM-Driven Discovery' is not empirically validated in the paper's reported experiment. The provided code (`simplified_run.py`), which appears to generate the paper's figures and results, uses a function `generate_llm_hypotheses` that returns hardcoded, pre-defined hypotheses. For instance, 'Hypothesis 1' about 'color variations' mentioned in Section 6.4 is explicitly defined in the code. This means the paper presents simulated LLM outputs as evidence of the LLM's capability, which is a major flaw.\n2. **No Quantitative Improvement:** The experiments on the synthetic Waterbirds-like dataset show 0.00% improvement in worst-group accuracy (0.0 for ERM vs 0.0 for LASS, based on Figure 2 and Section 7) and 0.00% improvement in OOD accuracy (1.0 for ERM vs 1.0 for LASS). While the paper is transparent about this, it means the current experimental setup fails to demonstrate any practical benefit of the LASS framework. The synthetic dataset might be too simple or constructed in a way that ERM already performs at extremes (0.0 or 1.0 on groups), leaving no room for LASS to show improvement.\n3. **Inconsistent Results Reporting:** As mentioned under Clarity, there are inconsistencies in how Worst-Group Accuracy is reported across figures and the log file generated by the code. While the paper's text aligns with Figure 2 (WGA=0.0), the `log.txt` from `simplified_run.py` reports WGA=1.0 for both ERM and LASS on the test set, and Figure 1 (bottom-right) in the paper also shows WGA=1.0. This internal inconsistency in results derived from the same codebase is problematic.\n4. **Simplified Error Clustering:** The paper's methodology (Section 4.2.2) describes identifying confident errors and clustering their embeddings. The `simplified_run.py` code's `extract_error_clusters` function simplifies this by grouping errors based on true and predicted labels, without explicitly using embedding clustering or confidence thresholds as described for the LASS methodology in the paper.\n5. **Reliability of Figures/Analysis:** Given the LLM simulation, figures and analysis pertaining to the LLM's success in generating hypotheses are based on fake data, not real experimental outcomes of an LLM interacting with model errors."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The paper addresses a highly important problem: the discovery and mitigation of unknown spurious correlations, which is critical for building robust and trustworthy AI systems. The proposed LASS framework, if validated, could offer a significant contribution by automating parts of this challenging process. However, the current paper's significance is severely limited by the lack of compelling empirical evidence. The 0.00% quantitative improvement in the reported experiments means the paper does not demonstrate the practical utility or effectiveness of LASS. More critically, the simulation of the LLM's role means the 'LLM-driven' aspect, which is central to the paper's premise, remains an unverified claim within this work. The paper itself acknowledges it's a 'preliminary study' and 'a step towards' a solution. Without stronger empirical validation, particularly of the LLM's actual capabilities in this framework, the work's current impact is more as a conceptual proposal than a demonstrated solution."
