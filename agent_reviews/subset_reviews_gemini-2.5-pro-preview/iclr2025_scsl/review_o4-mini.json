        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written and structured. The core idea of SpurGen, a synthetic multimodal benchmark, is clearly introduced, along with its motivations. The proposed metrics (SSS and IG) are defined. However, there are some areas that could be improved for clarity and accuracy: \n1. The model architecture is described as a 'Two-layer MLP' in Section 5, but the code implements a pre-trained ResNet18 followed by an MLP. This is a significant difference.\n2. Image synthesis is claimed to use 'Blender' (Section 4.1.1), implying complex visuals, but the code uses PIL for simple geometric shapes. This discrepancy should be clarified.\n3. The paper mentions evaluation of five robustification methods in Section 4.3 but only ERM and IRM are experimentally evaluated, which is stated but could be more upfront.\n4. The 'multimodal' aspect is emphasized, but experiments are image-only, and the described textual spurious channels are more sophisticated than what the current image-focused code seems to support for captions."

        "justification": "The paper presents several novel ideas:\n1. **SpurGen Benchmark Idea**: The concept of a synthetic, configurable, multimodal benchmark (SpurGen) to study spurious correlations is valuable. While synthetic benchmarks exist (e.g., Colored MNIST), a modular platform for generating paired image-text data with fine-grained control over multiple orthogonal spurious channels is a strong novel contribution, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks (cost, scope).\n2. **Evaluation Metrics**: The introduction of the Spurious Sensitivity Score (SSS) and Invariance Gap (IG) as specific metrics to quantify reliance on spurious channels and model stability under spurious shifts is a novel aspect of this work. SSS, measuring prediction changes upon shuffling spurious features, and IG, comparing loss in controlled vs. uncontrolled spurious settings, offer new ways to evaluate model robustness in this context.\n3. **Public Codebase**: The commitment to release the SpurGen codebase and data generator is a valuable contribution to facilitate further research."

        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The soundness of the paper is severely undermined by several critical issues, primarily concerning the experimental validation of IRM and misrepresentations of the methodology:\n1. **Critical Flaw in IRM Implementation**: The IRM penalty weight is effectively zero throughout training due to the `irm_penalty_anneal_iters` (500) being much larger than the total training steps (9 steps for 3 epochs with 180 training samples and batch size 64). The log confirms `Penalty Weight: 0.0000` for IRM. This means the experiments did not actually apply the IRM penalty, invalidating the conclusions drawn about IRM's effectiveness and mechanism. The observed differences between 'ERM' and 'IRM' runs cannot be attributed to the IRM regularization as claimed.\n2. **Misrepresentation of Model Architecture**: The paper states a 'Two-layer MLP' (Section 5), but the code (`models/models.py`) uses a significantly more powerful pre-trained ResNet18 as a feature extractor followed by an MLP. This discrepancy affects the interpretation of model performance and complexity.\n3. **Misrepresentation of Image Generation**: The paper claims 'Procedural rendering via Blender' (Section 4.1.1), suggesting potentially complex 3D-rendered images. However, the provided code (`data/generator.py`) uses PIL to draw simple 2D geometric shapes and textures. The sample visualization (Figure 4) confirms PIL-like images. This changes the nature and complexity of the visual spurious features.\n4. **Experimental Scope and Dataset Size**: The experiments are conducted on a very small dataset (300 samples, 180 for training) for only 3 epochs. While this is a 'proof-of-concept', conclusions drawn from such limited data with deep models like ResNet18 are tentative. The paper mentions 5 random seeds for training curves, but Table 1 results appear to be from a single run as per the log, making their robustness unclear.\n5. **Limited Evaluation of Baselines**: The paper lists five robustification baselines but only evaluates ERM and IRM. While stated, this limits the breadth of the benchmark's demonstration.\n\nWhile the numerical results in Table 1 and figures are consistent with the execution logs (i.e., the numbers are 'real' outputs of the code), the interpretation of these results, particularly for IRM, is fundamentally flawed due to the inactive penalty. The conclusions about IRM reducing spurious reliance via its intended mechanism are not supported by the actual experiment conducted."

        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The problem of spurious correlations is highly significant in machine learning. The proposed SpurGen benchmark, if implemented correctly and thoroughly, has the potential to be a significant contribution by providing a controlled environment for studying these issues, especially in a multimodal context. The proposed metrics (SSS and IG) could also be valuable tools.\nHowever, the current paper's significance is diminished by the soundness issues. The flawed IRM experiment means the paper does not reliably demonstrate the utility of SpurGen for comparing robustification methods beyond ERM. The misrepresentations of the model and data generation also reduce confidence. \nIf the identified flaws (especially the IRM implementation and experimental setup) were addressed, and the benchmark expanded as promised (more modalities, robustification methods), the work could have a more substantial impact. As it stands, the primary significance lies in the conceptual proposal of SpurGen rather than its current empirical validation or findings."
