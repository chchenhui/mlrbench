        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is well-written and the core idea of Execution-Trace Alignment (ETA) is articulated clearly. The introduction effectively motivates the problem of sparse binary feedback in code generation, and the methodology section provides a logical and understandable description of the proposed trace generation and alignment processes (ETA-RM and ETA-DPO). The structure is coherent. The score is slightly reduced because the paper sets the expectation of an empirical study but ultimately reveals that the core experiments were not conducted, which could be confusing to the reader."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The central idea of systematically using detailed, step-wise execution traces as the primary preference signal for alignment fine-tuning (specifically with DPO) is novel. While prior work has used execution data in other contexts like pre-training or prompting, this paper proposes a specific framework for using it to create dense, causal feedback for alignment. The proposed heuristics for comparing traces (e.g., preferring traces that execute longer before failing) are a sensible and integral part of this novel proposal. The novelty lies in the proposed methodology rather than any demonstrated results."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The paper has critical flaws in its soundness. The primary claims about the effectiveness of ETA are entirely unsupported by empirical evidence. The paper explicitly states in Section 4 that the main experiments (ETA-DPO and PPO) were not performed due to 'prohibitive technical difficulties'. The only experiment conducted was a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) baseline using an inappropriate model ('gpt2') on a trivially small dataset (10 examples from HumanEval). The resulting 0% pass@1 is expected and provides no meaningful scientific insight. The analysis in Section 6 is purely speculative, hypothesizing about ETA's potential benefits without any data. While the code for the SFT baseline is provided and appears to reproduce the reported 0% pass rate, the core contribution of the paper is unimplemented and therefore irreproducible. The paper's conclusions are hypotheses, not findings."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The problem the paper addresses—improving Code LLM alignment with richer feedback signals—is highly significant. A successful implementation of the proposed ETA method could have a substantial impact on developing more reliable code generation models. However, the paper's contribution is purely conceptual at this stage. Without any experimental validation, its actual significance is minimal. It presents an interesting idea that might inspire future work, but as a standalone contribution, it provides no evidence of impact. The work is a proposal, not a proven result, which severely limits its current significance."
