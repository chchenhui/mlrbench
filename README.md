## üí° Introduction
**MLR-Bench** is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research. It includes three key components: 
1. **Benchmark Dataset**: 201 research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics;
2. **MLR-Agent**: a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing;
3. **MLR-Judge**: an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality.

## üìö Benchmark Dataset
We colleted 201 tasks from ICLR/ICML/NeurIPS workshops over the past three years, as shown in ```tasks/```. Information of task metadata can be found in ```task_metadata.md```. This table show the number of tasks for different years.

|Year | Number |
|--------|------|
|2023 | 73 |
|2024 | 91 | 
|2025 | 37 |

The tasks can be categorized into 9 core ML topics: LLMs and Vision Language Models (VLMs), AI for Science, ML Theory, Trustworthy AI, Computer Vision, ML Systems, Multimodality, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and other emerging topics. Figure 2 shows the distribution.

Our benchmark dataset is already released at Huggingface: [Link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/chchenhui/mlrbench-tasks). 

## üõ†Ô∏è Experimental Setup
Create a conda environment ```mlrbench``` and install all dependencies.
```bash
conda create -n mlrbench python=3.12
conda activate mlrbench
cd mlrbench
# pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

This work contains several frontier models such as ```o4-mini```, ```claude-3-7-sonnet``` and ```gemini-2.5-pro-preview```. We use OpenAI API and Anthropic API to access ```o4-mini``` and ```claude-3-7-sonnet```. We use OpenRouter API to access other models.
Please set up your API keys before starting the experiments:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key-here"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key-here"
```

## üöÄ MLR Agent

If you want to run our agent in an end-to-end manner, please create ```your_task_folder``` and put ```your_task``` containing a ```task.md``` inside. Note that our agent will sequentially complete all tasks in ```your_task_folder```. Therefore, if you only need to complete one task, please place only that task in ```your_task_folder```.

```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <your_task_folder>
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <your_task1>
    ‚îÇ      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ task.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <your_task2>
           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ task.md
```
Then, run the following command:
```bash
python run_mlr_agent.py --model_name <model_name> --task_folder <task_folder>
```

If you want to run the agent step by step, please set up your own configs in ```mlrbench/agent``` and then run
```bash
python mlrbench/agent/idea_generator.py
python mlrbench/agent/lit_review.py
python mlrbench/agent/proposal_generator.py
bash mlrbench/agent/claude.sh
python mlrbench/agent/paper_writer.py
```
Results will be saved in a ```Markdown``` file.

## üìù MLR Judge
If you want to review the generated results, please look into ```mlrbench/evals``` and set up your own configs. 

For end-to-end evaluation, please run this command:
```bash
python mlrbench/evals/overall_review.py
```
For stepwise evaluation, please run
```bash
python mlrbench/evals/review_idea.py
```
