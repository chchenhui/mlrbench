  "Experiment_description": "We evaluated data valuation networks (DVNs) on synthetic tasks: first as a naive regression on batch\u2010aggregated features in binary classification (Node 3dae8cc\u2026), then as meta\u2010learned samplers integrated into training of sinusoidal regression models (Nodes c038abef\u2026, ecfb200246\u2026, a825ee139\u2026).",
  "Significance": "These experiments reveal critical failure modes of DVN approaches: simple feature\u2010based regressors produce constant, uninformative outputs, while meta\u2010learned samplers can achieve moderate alignment with true sample contributions but are sensitive to implementation details and prone to overfitting or signal decay after early epochs. Understanding these behaviors is vital for designing robust data\u2010valuation and sampling algorithms.",
  "Description": "On the binary classification task, we standardized data, trained a small MLP, and collected batch\u2010level loss and embedding\u2010diversity features to train a regression DVN, measuring Spearman correlation per epoch. On the regression tasks, we generated a noisy sinusoid, split into train/held\u2010out sets, and ran a two\u2010MLP meta\u2010learning loop: the DVN scores reweight per\u2010sample losses via softmax, the foundation model updates on these weights, and true contributions are measured by held\u2010out loss deltas after single\u2010sample updates. DVNs are then updated on (loss, contribution) pairs. We logged train/val losses and Spearman correlations each epoch.",
