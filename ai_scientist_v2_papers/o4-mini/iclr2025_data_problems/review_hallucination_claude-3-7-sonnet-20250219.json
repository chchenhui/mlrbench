It claims specific performance improvements (30% fewer updates, 1-3% accuracy gains) on text classification benchmarks that are not supported by the provided code or results. The code only implements a synthetic regression task, while the paper claims to evaluate on AG News, Yelp, and DBpedia datasets. Additionally, the paper claims to compare against gradient-norm sampling as a baseline, but this comparison is not implemented in the code. These hallucinations significantly misrepresent the actual work performed and the results obtained.",
