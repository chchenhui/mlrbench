The abstract and introduction state that the proposed DVN sampler improves accuracy by 1-3% and reduces updates by 30% compared to these baselines. However, the provided experimental code only implements the DVN sampler itself and contains no implementation or execution of the uniform or gradient-norm sampling baselines. Therefore, the comparisons shown in Figures 1 and 2, which form the core evidence for the paper's contributions, are based on experiments that were never performed.",

The provided code in `research_summary.json` and `baseline_summary.json` lacks any implementation of these baseline methods, making a comparison impossible."

It claims the DVN uses 'per-sample loss, gradient norm, embedding norm' as proxy features. A review of the source code reveals that while 'per-sample loss' and 'embedding norm' are used, the third feature is 'input entropy', not 'gradient norm'.",

For instance, the paper claims in the caption for Figure 5 that omitting the embedding-norm feature 'drops validation accuracy by 2-4%'. However, the actual experimental data from `ablation_summary.json` shows inconsistent results: a 12% drop for AG News, a 1.5% drop for Yelp, and an actual *improvement* for DBpedia. The reported range is a misleading summary of the true outcomes. Furthermore, the figures in the paper appear to be simplified sketches rather than direct plots of the experimental data.",

    "overall_assessment": "The paper contains severe and critical hallucinations. The central experimental claims, which involve comparisons to baseline methods, are entirely fabricated, as these baselines were never implemented. The methodology is also misreported, with one of the key input features being different in the code than what is described in the paper. While some ablation studies were conducted, their results are inaccurately summarized. Due to the fabrication of core results, the paper is fundamentally unsound and its conclusions are not supported by the provided evidence.",
