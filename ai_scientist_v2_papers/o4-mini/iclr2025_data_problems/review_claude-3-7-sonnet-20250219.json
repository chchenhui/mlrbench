        "justification": "The paper presents its core idea clearly - using a meta-learned Data Valuation Network (DVN) to predict sample contributions and guide adaptive sampling. The structure follows a logical flow from introduction to experiments. However, there are significant issues: (1) The mathematical formulation in Section 4 is poorly formatted and lacks clarity on how the meta-update works; (2) The experimental setup in Section 5 is extremely sparse, with most details relegated to an appendix that is also minimal; (3) There's a major disconnect between the paper's framing (pre-training large Transformer models on 'billions of tokens') and the actual experiments (small MLPs on text classification with 1k samples); (4) Figures are referenced but not shown in the paper, making it difficult to evaluate the claimed results."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper combines existing ideas in a somewhat novel way. The core concept of using a meta-learned network to predict sample contributions is an incremental advance over prior work like Data Shapley (Ghorbani & Zou, 2019) and GLISTER (Killamsetty et al., 2020). The main novelty lies in the amortization of expensive influence computations through a lightweight predictor network. However, the approach is quite similar to existing meta-learning for sample reweighting (Ren et al., 2018), with the primary difference being the application context. The paper acknowledges these connections but doesn't clearly articulate what makes its technical approach fundamentally different from prior work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 1,
        "justification": "The paper has severe soundness issues that invalidate its main claims: (1) According to the provided code, the DVN method actually performs worse than uniform sampling on 2 out of 3 datasets (Yelp: 83% vs 84.5%; DBpedia: 58.5% vs 63%); (2) The claim of reaching target loss with 30% fewer updates is not substantiated by any comparative baseline experiments in the synthetic task; (3) The ablation studies are inconsistent with the code results - for example, the paper claims removing the 'embedding-norm' feature drops accuracy by 2-4%, but the logs show this isn't consistently true across datasets; (4) There's a fundamental mismatch between the claimed setting (large-scale pre-training) and the actual experiments (small-scale classification); (5) The figures described in the paper appear to be illustrative rather than based on actual experimental results. These issues collectively suggest that the paper's conclusions are not supported by reliable evidence."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The problem of efficient data sampling for foundation model pre-training is highly significant, and a solution that reduces training time by 30% would be valuable. However, the paper's significance is severely undermined by its soundness issues. The experiments are conducted on small-scale text classification tasks with TF-IDF features and MLPs, not on the large-scale pre-training scenarios the paper claims to address. The results don't convincingly demonstrate benefits over simple baselines, and in some cases, the method performs worse. The paper doesn't provide evidence that the approach would scale to or benefit real foundation model pre-training with billions of tokens, which significantly limits its practical impact."
