There is no implementation of this pipeline in the provided code. Consequently, the results reported in Section 5.3, including specific filter thresholds (FID<50, perplexity<40) and human evaluation outcomes (~30% unnatural texts), are faked as the experiments were never performed.",

The central methodological contribution—a 'synthetic rejuvenation pipeline'—is entirely fabricated, and its associated experimental results are faked. Furthermore, key details of the experiments that were actually performed, such as the number of training epochs and the specific data augmentations used, are reported incorrectly. The paper is fundamentally misleading about its contributions and methods.",
