It includes a factually incorrect citation, misrepresents key hyperparameters of the experimental setup (batch size and dropout), and fabricates numerical results by significantly exaggerating the model's performance on the memory retention metric. These hallucinations fundamentally undermine the reproducibility and credibility of the research.",
