  "Experiment_description": "Implementation of a Transformer-XL\u2013style model with token-level self-attention entropy driving a fixed-capacity memory compression mechanism, evaluated on synthetic integer sequence next-token prediction.",
  "Significance": "This experiment probes whether entropy-based memory compression can selectively retain the most informative tokens under strict memory budgets, balancing sequence modeling performance and resource constraints. Demonstrating stable retention and learning indicates the potential of novelty-aware memory schemes for longer context modeling.",
  "Description": "A synthetic dataset of random integer sequences was generated and split into train/validation sets. A single memory-aware Transformer layer concatenates past token embeddings with current inputs, computes self-attention to derive per-token entropy, and retains the top-entropy tokens up to a fixed capacity after each chunk. The model is trained for three epochs using cross-entropy loss; at each epoch, training/validation losses and the Entropy Preservation Ratio are recorded. Finally, one validation sequence is generated autoregressively, compared to ground truth, and visualized.",

      "analysis": "The training loss decreases steeply from ~3.95 to 3.67 while validation loss falls more modestly from ~3.90 to 3.79, showing effective learning with only a small generalization gap widening (~0.12 by epoch 3)."

      "description": "Memory Retention over Epochs remains highly stable, with training ratio rising slightly then dipping marginally, and validation retention following a similar pattern.",
      "analysis": "Retention ratios hover around 0.8215 (train) and 0.8214 (val) with fluctuations <0.001, indicating the entropy-aware compressor is maintaining a consistent level of information preservation under the fixed memory budget."

      "analysis": "The model reproduces overall distributional characteristics (value range and variability) but fails at precise temporal localization, signaling the need for further tuning or extended training to improve sequence-level accuracy."
