        "justification": "The paper presents its core idea clearly: using self-attention entropy to guide memory compression in Transformers. The structure follows a logical flow from introduction to related work, method description, and experiments. The method is explained concisely with sufficient technical detail to understand the entropy-based token selection mechanism. However, there are several clarity issues: (1) The figures lack y-axis scales, making it impossible to gauge the absolute magnitude of improvements; (2) The experimental setup is described briefly but lacks important details about model architecture choices; (3) The paper doesn't clearly explain how the entropy-weighted memory efficiency metric is calculated, despite its importance to the results; (4) The abstract claims specific numerical improvements (~0.002-0.004 gain in memory retention ratio) without contextualizing what these numbers mean in practical terms."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper introduces a novel approach to memory compression in Transformer models by using self-attention entropy as a signal for token importance. This is a logical and intuitive extension of existing work. The authors correctly position their contribution relative to prior work like Transformer-XL (which uses fixed-length recurrence) and Compressive Transformer (which uses fixed-rate compression). The idea of using entropy as a measure of token novelty/importance is not entirely new in NLP, but its application to guide memory compression in Transformers appears to be original. However, the novelty is incremental rather than transformative - it's a clever modification to existing architectures rather than a fundamentally new approach to the problem of long-context modeling."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The paper has several critical soundness issues: (1) The experiments are conducted on an extremely small scale (200 training examples, 100 validation examples) with a tiny model (embedding dimension 32, 2 heads), making it questionable whether the results would generalize to realistic settings; (2) The ablation studies contradict the paper's main claims - for example, the recency-based baseline actually achieves lower (better) validation loss on ArXiv (2.49 vs 2.51) and WikiText-2 (1.3529 vs 1.3526) compared to EA-ACM; (3) The paper claims 'consistent validation loss reductions' but the evidence doesn't support this consistency across datasets; (4) There's a discrepancy between the reported batch size (8) in the paper and the actual batch size (1) used in the code; (5) The memory retention ratio improvements are tiny (0.002-0.004) and their practical significance is not established; (6) The paper doesn't include statistical significance tests or error bars to establish the reliability of the reported improvements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The problem of efficient long-context modeling in Transformers is highly significant for the field, and improvements in memory compression could have substantial practical impact. The paper addresses this important challenge. However, the significance of this specific contribution is limited by several factors: (1) The extremely small-scale experiments don't demonstrate that the approach works in realistic settings with larger models and datasets; (2) The improvements in key metrics are very small and sometimes inconsistent across datasets; (3) The paper doesn't demonstrate the approach's impact on downstream tasks that would benefit from better long-context modeling (e.g., document summarization, long-form QA); (4) The ablation studies suggest that simpler approaches (like recency-based memory) can sometimes outperform the proposed method, raising questions about the practical utility of the entropy-based approach."
