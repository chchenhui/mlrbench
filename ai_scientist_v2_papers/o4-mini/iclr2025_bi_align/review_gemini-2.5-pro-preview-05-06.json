        "justification": "The paper is well-written and the core idea of 'Co-Adaptive Explanation Interfaces' is clearly articulated. The abstract and introduction effectively set the stage, and the negative results are presented transparently. The structure is logical, following a standard research paper format. While concise, which is suitable for a workshop, some details regarding the bias estimator's specific mechanisms and the dynamic update rules for explanations are high-level. However, the main contributions, including the proposed interface and the discussion of evaluation pitfalls, are easy to understand."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed 'Co-Adaptive Explanation Interfaces' framework, which integrates dual-channel feedback (content justification and bias-awareness signals) and models mutual adaptation between AI and user, presents a novel approach in the XAI landscape. While individual components like interactive machine learning or bias modeling exist, their specific combination and application to achieve bidirectional alignment in XAI appear original. Furthermore, the paper's honest reporting and analysis of negative results, leading to a discussion on evaluation pitfalls for dynamic XAI systems, is a valuable and somewhat novel contribution in itself, as it provides critical insights for future research methodology."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The conceptual framework of the co-adaptive interface is sound. The experimental design, though ultimately revealing the task's triviality, was a reasonable first step. The paper's conclusion that the synthetic task was too simple, leading to performance saturation across all tested interfaces, is well-supported by the presented results and the provided code logs. For instance, Figure 1 in the paper, showing baseline convergence to >99% accuracy, is consistent with the `baseline_summary.json` and `research_summary.json` from the code, which report accuracies like 0.9933 for various batch sizes. Similarly, ablation studies in the paper (Figures 2, 3, and supplementary Figures 4, 5) on feature removal, label input types, confidence thresholds, class imbalance, and activation functions all show minimal impact on the already saturated performance, which is corroborated by the detailed results in the `ablation_summary.json` file. The main limitation, acknowledged by the authors, is the use of simulated users and a simplistic task, which prevents a definitive evaluation of the proposed dual-channel interface's benefits. The experimental results are reliable in demonstrating this task limitation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper addresses the important and timely problem of human-AI alignment, specifically focusing on dynamic and adaptive explainable AI. While the proposed co-adaptive interface itself is not validated with positive results in this work, the paper's significance lies in its contribution to the methodology of evaluating such systems. The clear demonstration of how a seemingly reasonable synthetic task can be too trivial to differentiate between XAI methods is an important cautionary finding for the field. This aligns well with the workshop's scope, particularly 'Broader Definitions and clarifications of Current Alignment Research' and 'Opinions: Position Papers and Roadmaps for Future Alignment Research'. The insights on evaluation pitfalls could have a lasting impact on how researchers design and validate interactive and co-adaptive AI systems."
