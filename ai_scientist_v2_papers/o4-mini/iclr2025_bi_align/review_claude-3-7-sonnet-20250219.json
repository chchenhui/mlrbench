        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written with a clear structure. The abstract effectively summarizes the proposed approach and findings. The introduction provides good context on the limitations of static post-hoc explanations. The method section clearly describes the three interfaces being compared. However, there are some clarity issues: (1) The paper lacks sufficient detail on how the bias detector is trained and how it identifies systematic deviations between user actions and model outputs; (2) The dual-channel co-adaptive interface is not explained in enough detail to fully understand how the bias-awareness signals work in practice; (3) The experimental setup section is quite brief and would benefit from more details on how users are simulated and what specific biases are modeled."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper introduces a novel concept of 'Co-Adaptive Explanation Interfaces' with dual-channel feedback that combines content justifications with bias-awareness signals. This approach extends beyond traditional static explainers like LIME and SHAP by modeling user cognitive biases and adapting explanations in real-time. The bidirectional alignment process is a valuable contribution to the XAI literature. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by: (1) The paper builds incrementally on existing work in interactive machine teaching and personalized explanations; (2) The concept of modeling user biases in XAI has been explored in prior work, though perhaps not in this specific dual-channel format; (3) The negative results suggest that the proposed method doesn't demonstrate clear advantages over simpler approaches in the experimental setting used."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The paper has several methodological issues that affect its soundness: (1) As the authors themselves acknowledge, the synthetic 2D classification task is too trivial, leading to near-perfect performance across all conditions and making it impossible to differentiate between methods; (2) The paper claims to implement a bias-aware interface but provides no details on how this was actually implemented, and the code provided in the supplementary materials only shows the static baseline and various ablations, not the dual-channel co-adaptive interface; (3) The user simulation approach is oversimplified, using neural 'user models' that may not realistically capture human cognitive biases; (4) The paper mentions four alignment metrics (trust calibration error, labeling accuracy, KL-divergence, and post-hoc questionnaire scores) but doesn't report comprehensive results for these metrics; (5) The ablation studies (feature removal, label noise, confidence thresholds) don't provide meaningful insights due to the ceiling effect in the task."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper addresses an important problem in human-AI alignment, specifically how to create explanation interfaces that adapt to user biases and provide feedback to correct misalignments. This is relevant to the workshop's focus on bidirectional human-AI alignment. The paper's main significance lies in: (1) Proposing a conceptual framework for co-adaptive explanations that could inspire future work; (2) Highlighting important pitfalls in XAI evaluation design, particularly the need for more challenging tasks that can differentiate between methods; (3) Advocating for human-grounded studies with realistic cognitive load measures. However, the significance is limited by: (1) The lack of positive results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach; (2) The absence of experiments with real human participants; (3) The failure to test on more complex, realistic tasks where the benefits of co-adaptation might be more apparent."
