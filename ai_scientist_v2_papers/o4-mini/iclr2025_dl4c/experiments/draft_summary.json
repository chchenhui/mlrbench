  "Experiment_description": "Contrastive retrieval of dynamically equivalent code snippets via triplet margin training on synthetic datasets: small arithmetic functions and toy Python function variants. We compare three encoder architectures\u2014character\u2010level embedding + MLP, lightweight Transformer, and LSTM\u2014using dynamic execution traces for positive pair generation and random negatives.",
  "Significance": "These experiments establish the first baselines for dynamic\u2010trace\u2010augmented contrastive pre\u2010training in code retrieval. They demonstrate how dataset simplicity can lead to trivial perfect accuracy or overfitting, while more challenging synthetic arithmetic benchmarks yield moderate retrieval performance. The findings underscore the importance of dataset complexity and hard negative mining for robust contrastive code\u2010representation learning.",
  "Description": "Each pipeline generates synthetic code snippets grouped by identical dynamic traces on random inputs. Code is char\u2010tokenized or tokenized, padded, and fed through an encoder (character\u2010level + MLP, Transformer, or LSTM) to produce embeddings. Training uses a triplet margin loss with one positive (same trace group) and one negative example per anchor. At each epoch, we record training/validation losses and Top\u20101 trace\u2010equivalence retrieval accuracy by nearest\u2010neighbor ranking in the learned embedding space.",
