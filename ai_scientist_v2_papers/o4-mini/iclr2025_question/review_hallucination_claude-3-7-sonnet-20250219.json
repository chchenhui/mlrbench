    "overall_assessment": "The paper contains several significant hallucinations. It cites an incorrect source for BERT, fabricates MC-dropout baseline results that aren't implemented in the code, and claims to use back-translation and PEGASUS-based paraphrasing methods that aren't actually implemented. These hallucinations misrepresent both the methodology and comparative results, undermining the paper's credibility.",
