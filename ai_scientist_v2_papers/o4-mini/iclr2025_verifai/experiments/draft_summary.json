  "Experiment_description": "Three preliminary implementations of synthetic arithmetic code generation were tested: (1) a dummy LLM template\u2010based generator with on\u2010the\u2010fly static\u2010analysis\u2010guided repairs, (2) a lightweight embedding+linear classification model with automatic division-by-zero rewriting, and (3) a seeded repeat of (2). All variants are evaluated via unit tests on random inputs (including zeros) to compute an Error-Free Generation Rate and, for the trainable models, tracked losses.",
  "Significance": "These experiments demonstrate that even a minimal static analysis component integrated into the code\u2010generation loop can completely eliminate a common class of runtime errors (division by zero). They also reveal that on trivial synthetic tasks a simple model quickly achieves perfect error rates and near-zero loss, indicating the need for more challenging benchmarks to assess generalization and robustness.",
  "Description": "Node 3012f1 used Python's ast module to detect division operations in naive template code and injected zero-check guards before executing unit tests for add, divide, and factorial tasks. Node 79fce4 trained a four\u2010class classifier in PyTorch to generate arithmetic functions, applied a fast static analyzer to rewrite unsafe divisions, and logged per\u2010epoch train/validation losses and error\u2010free rates. Node ab8777 repeated the same pipeline with fixed random seeds to assess reproducibility. All metrics were saved in structured .npy files and visualized via loss and error\u2010rate curves.",
