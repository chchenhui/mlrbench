It cites nonexistent references (SemFix with question marks), refers to a nonexistent figure in the appendix, claims to use Mypy plugins for abstract interpretation that aren't implemented in the code, and reports experimental results on HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks that weren't actually conducted according to the provided code. The code only implements a simple classifier on a synthetic dataset of four arithmetic operations, not the sophisticated abstract interpretation pipeline described in the paper.",
