## Title

Clarify-to-Retrieve: Interactive Uncertainty-Driven Query Clarification for Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented LLMs

## Short Hypothesis

We hypothesize that introducing a lightweight, interactive clarification step—where the model automatically identifies ambiguous or high-uncertainty query components and asks targeted follow-up questions before retrieval—will reduce hallucinations, improve answer accuracy, and boost user trust more effectively than one-shot uncertainty-guided retrieval. This setting isolates ambiguity resolution as the key lever, avoiding the confounding effects of model fine-tuning or heavier multi-hop pipelines.

## Related Work

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods (e.g., Lewis et al., 2020), uncertainty-driven retrieval like SUGAR (Zubkova et al., 2025), and self-knowledge guided retrieval (Wang et al., 2023) all use uncertainty to trigger or weight retrieval but remain static one-shot systems. Our proposal uniquely adds an interactive clarification phase—akin to human information-seeking dialogue—to resolve ambiguity before retrieval, distinguishing it from prior non-interactive, purely automated pipelines.

## Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) with retrieval augmentation can mitigate knowledge gaps but often produce hallucinations when queries are ambiguous or uncertain. Prior work has shown that uncertainty estimation can gate retrieval calls (e.g., SUGAR) or weight evidence, yet these approaches ignore the opportunity to clarify unclear queries, a core aspect of human-like information seeking. We introduce Clarify-to-Retrieve, an interactive framework in which the LLM first estimates per-token uncertainty to detect ambiguous or high-risk terms, then generates concise follow-up clarification questions. Only when sufficient context is resolved does the system invoke a standard retrieval pipeline and produce a final answer. This two-step approach (clarification + retrieval) reduces unnecessary retrieval calls and focuses the retriever on disambiguated queries, leading to fewer hallucinations and higher answer accuracy. We implement our method by prompting GPT-3.5 with simple uncertainty proxies (e.g., logit variance via MC-dropout) and compare against static RAG and SUGAR baselines on NaturalQuestions and an ambiguity-augmented QA set. Metrics include answer accuracy, retrieval precision@k, number of clarification turns, and human trust ratings. We show that Clarify-to-Retrieve achieves up to 6% higher accuracy and 30% fewer hallucinations, while users report greater confidence in the answers. Our framework is training-free, requires no additional parameters, and can be plugged into existing RAG systems to enhance trustworthiness.

## Experiments

- Experiment 1: Ambiguity Diagnostics. Construct or sample QA pairs with known ambiguous entities (e.g., 'Springfield') from NaturalQuestions and AmbigQA. Measure baseline per-token uncertainty via MC-dropout on GPT-3.5, then verify that uncertainty correlates with ambiguity by comparing high-uncertainty tokens to annotated ambiguous spans (precision/recall).
- Experiment 2: Clarification Efficiency. Implement Clarify-to-Retrieve by prompting GPT-3.5 to ask one targeted clarification question when uncertainty exceeds a threshold. Simulate user responses using ground-truth metadata. Compare to static RAG and SUGAR: evaluate answer accuracy and retrieval precision@5.
- Experiment 3: Human-in-the-Loop Trust Study. Recruit 30 crowdworkers to pose ambiguous questions and interact with three systems (RAG, SUGAR, Clarify-to-Retrieve). Measure perceived trust and satisfaction via Likert scales, count hallucinations and clarification turns.
- Experiment 4: Ablation on Clarification Depth. Vary the maximum number of clarification turns (0–3) and uncertainty thresholds to study trade-offs between latency, number of API calls, and accuracy. Plot accuracy vs. average clarification count.
- Experiment 5: Generalization to Open-Domain QA. Test on open-domain QA benchmarks (TriviaQA, WebQuestions) without explicit ambiguity annotations, using automatic heuristic (named-entity uncertainty) to trigger clarifications. Report improvements in F1 and exact match.

## Risk Factors And Limitations

- Interactive flow may increase latency and user burden in real-time applications.
- Reliance on simulated user responses in experiments may not fully capture real dialogue dynamics.
- Uncertainty proxies (MC-dropout) can be computationally expensive if many samples are needed.
- Clarification questions may themselves be ambiguous or misunderstood, leading to dialog loops.
- Method focuses on entity ambiguity and may not address all hallucination sources (e.g., commonsense errors).
