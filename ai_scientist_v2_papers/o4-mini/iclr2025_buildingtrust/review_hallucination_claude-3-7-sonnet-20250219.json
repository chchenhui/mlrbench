    "overall_assessment": "The paper contains several significant hallucinations. It cites a nonexistent paper from 2025, claims to use MC-dropout on GPT-3.5 when the code only simulates this behavior, and presents experimental results on QA benchmarks that were actually simulated rather than obtained through real model evaluations. These hallucinations misrepresent both the methodology and the empirical validation of the proposed approach.",
