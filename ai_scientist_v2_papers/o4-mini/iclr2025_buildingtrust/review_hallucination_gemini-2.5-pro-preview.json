However, the provided source code reveals that none of these components were implemented. The experiments were conducted using a simple hardcoded simulation that assumes questions from the AmbigQA dataset are always ambiguous and perfectly resolved by one clarification, while questions from other datasets are never ambiguous.",

However, the underlying code shows this was also a simulation. It programmatically flips the 'ambiguous' label with a certain probability rather than running the actual model with noisy inputs. Therefore, the reported robustness and graceful degradation are fabricated outcomes of this simulation, not real experimental results.",

Beyond 10%, performance degrades gracefully.\" \nCode for noise ablation: `if np.random.rand() < p: detected = not true_ambig else: detected = true_ambig`. This simulates noisy detection without running any model."

    "overall_assessment": "The paper contains severe and extensive hallucinations. The entire methodology described for the main QA experiments is fabricated, as the provided code consists of a simple, hardcoded simulation rather than the claimed RAG pipeline with uncertainty estimation and interactive clarification. Consequently, all reported results for the QA benchmarks, including specific accuracy gains, hallucination reduction rates, and ablation studies, are faked. The inclusion of a nonexistent citation with a future date further erodes the paper's credibility. The work is fundamentally misrepresented.",
