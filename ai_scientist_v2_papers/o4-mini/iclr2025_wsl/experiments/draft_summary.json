  "Experiment_description": "Baseline synthetic dictionary\u2010learning pipeline: sparse reconstruction of weight vectors using a learnable dictionary of primitives and sparse codes, optimized with \u21132 reconstruction loss and \u21131 sparsity penalty, with per\u2010epoch logging of training and validation errors and MSE.",
  "Significance": "These preliminary experiments verify that the optimization framework converges on training data but reveals a perplexing lack of validation improvement. Identifying this issue at an early stage is crucial to ensure meaningful generalization evaluation and to avoid misleading downstream conclusions.",
  "Description": "Generate synthetic weight vectors by sparse combinations of a small ground\u2010truth set of weight primitives; split into training and validation sets. Parameterize dictionary atoms and sparse codes as PyTorch GPU Parameters. Jointly optimize via \u21132 reconstruction loss plus \u21131 sparsity penalty over 50 epochs. Record training and validation relative errors and reconstruction MSEs into a nested metrics dictionary and save as experiment_data.npy.",
