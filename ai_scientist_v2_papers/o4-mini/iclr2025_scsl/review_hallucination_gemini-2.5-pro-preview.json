However, the provided source code and the experiments section of the paper itself only contain results for a single synthetic dataset. The `idea.md` file confirms that using these real-world datasets was part of the initial plan, but the implementation files (`research_summary.json`, `ablation_summary.json`, etc.) show these experiments were never performed.",

This contradicts the provided code, which only implements a synthetic dataset."

However, the provided source code in all experimental logs (`research_summary.json`, `ablation_summary.json`) shows that the gradient vectors are clustered directly without any PCA step.",

    "overall_assessment": "The paper contains severe hallucinations. Most critically, it fabricates experimental results in the abstract by claiming evaluation on three standard real-world benchmarks (Colored MNIST, Waterbirds, CelebA) which were never actually performed according to the provided code and the paper's own results section. This is a major misrepresentation of the work's empirical validation. Additionally, the paper hallucinates a methodological detail (the use of PCA) which is absent from the implementation. While the core idea and the reported synthetic experiments appear sound, the faked results in the abstract constitute a critical flaw.",
