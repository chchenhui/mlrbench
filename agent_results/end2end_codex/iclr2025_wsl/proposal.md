Title  
Task-Conditioned Diffusion Models in Neural Weight Space for Rapid Transfer  

Introduction  
Background  
The exponential growth of publicly available neural network models—now exceeding a million on repositories such as Hugging Face—offers a new perspective: treating the weights of trained networks themselves as a data modality. Recent work on weight‐space learning has explored properties such as permutation symmetries, scaling laws, and equivariant architectures [1,2]. Generative methods in weight space remain nascent, often suffering from overfitting or mere memorization [3,4]. Meanwhile, diffusion models in image and text domains have achieved state‐of‐the‐art results in high-dimensional generation tasks, by learning complex distributions via a forward–reverse stochastic process. Combining these two observations, we propose to learn a conditional diffusion model over neural network weights, driven by task metadata, to produce high‐quality weight initializations for rapid downstream transfer.  

Research Objectives  
1. Develop a conditional generative model $p_\theta(w_0 \mid c)$ over flattened, normalized weight vectors $w_0\in\mathbb R^D$, conditioned on task descriptor $c\in\mathcal C$.  
2. Leverage diffusion processes to capture complex, multimodal distributions in weight space while respecting inherent symmetries (e.g., layer‐wise permutation invariance).  
3. Demonstrate that generated initializations achieve faster convergence, improved few-shot generalization, and reduced energy consumption compared to random or meta-learned seeds.  

Significance  
• Efficiency and Sustainability: By reducing training iterations and GPU hours, this approach lowers the carbon footprint of large‐scale model training.  
• Democratization: Resource-constrained labs and practitioners can obtain high-quality models for novel tasks without massive compute budgets.  
• Scientific Discovery: A generative understanding of weight distributions can shed light on model lineage, interpretability, and generalization phenomena.  

Methodology  
We outline the research design in five parts: dataset construction, diffusion framework, network architecture, training and sampling algorithms, and evaluation protocols.  

1. Dataset Construction and Preprocessing  
a. Model Zoo Curation  
   – Collect $N\approx10^4$ pretrained models spanning architectures (ResNets, transformers, MLPs, INRs) and tasks (vision, language, 3D reconstruction, physics simulation).  
   – For each model $i$, record its weight tensors $\{W_i^{(l)}\}_{l=1}^L$, along with task metadata $c_i$ (dataset statistics, label cardinality, domain embeddings).  

b. Weight Flattening and Normalization  
   – Flatten parameters into a vector $w_i\in\mathbb R^D: w_i = \mathrm{concat}\bigl(\mathrm{vec}(W_i^{(1)}),\dots,\mathrm{vec}(W_i^{(L)})\bigr)$.  
   – Standardize each dimension across the dataset:  
     $$\tilde w_{i, j} = \frac{w_{i,j} - \mu_j}{\sigma_j},\quad \mu_j = \frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N w_{i,j},\;\;\sigma_j^2 = \frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N (w_{i,j}-\mu_j)^2.$$  
   – Store normalized weights $\tilde w_i$.  

c. Task Descriptor Encoding  
   – Encode $c_i$ via an MLP or transformer into an embedding vector $e_i\in\mathbb R^E$. Components include: input distribution moments, number of classes, domain‐specific embeddings (e.g., text‐based for language, scene descriptors for vision).  

2. Diffusion Model Framework  
We model the generative process as a discrete‐time diffusion over $T$ timesteps. Let $t=0,\dots,T$, $w_0\sim p_{\mathrm{data}}(\tilde w)$, and the forward noising process is:  
$$w_t = \sqrt{\alpha_t}\,w_{t-1} + \sqrt{1-\alpha_t}\,\epsilon_t,\quad \epsilon_t\sim\mathcal N(0,I),$$  
with $\{\alpha_t\}$ a noise schedule (e.g., cosine schedule). In closed form,  
$$w_t = \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}\,w_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar\alpha_t}\,\epsilon,\quad \bar\alpha_t=\prod_{s=1}^t\alpha_s.$$  

The parameterized reverse denoising model $\epsilon_\theta(w_t,t,e)$ predicts the added noise given the noisy weight $w_t$, timestep $t$, and condition embedding $e$.  

3. Network Architecture  
a. Base Denoiser  
   – Use an MLP‐based U-Net: alternating residual blocks, layer normalization, and FiLM conditioning via $e$. At each block, we inject time embeddings $\tau(t)\in\mathbb R^H$ (sinusoidal or learned) and task embedding $e$.  
   – Each residual block:  
     $$h\leftarrow\mathrm{LayerNorm}(h),\quad h\leftarrow h + \mathrm{MLP}\bigl(h\odot\mathrm{FiLM}(e,\tau(t))\bigr).$$  
   – Factorized structure to respect the layer segmentation of weights: process each layer’s flattened parameters separately, using shared weights across layers of the same type.  

b. Equivariance and Symmetry Handling  
   – Incorporate permutation‐equivariant modules for layers of identical shape, ensuring that reordering channels in convolutional layers does not affect generated distributions. This follows [1,5].  
   – Scaling invariances handled by batch‐wise weight normalization in the decoder.  

4. Training Algorithm  
We minimize the denoising score‐matching loss:  
$$\mathcal L(\theta) = \mathbb E_{w_0,t,\epsilon}\Bigl[\|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(w_t,t,e)\|^2\Bigr],$$  
where $t\sim\mathrm{Uniform}\{1,\dots,T\}$, $w_t = \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}\,w_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar\alpha_t}\,\epsilon$, and $e$ is the embedded task descriptor.  

Pseudocode for training:  
1. For each minibatch of $(w_0,e)$ from the model zoo:  
   a. Sample timestep $t\sim \mathrm{Uniform}\{1,\dots,T\}$.  
   b. Sample noise $\epsilon\sim\mathcal N(0,I)$.  
   c. Compute $w_t = \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}\,w_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar\alpha_t}\,\epsilon$.  
   d. Predict $\hat\epsilon = \epsilon_\theta(w_t,t,e)$.  
   e. Compute $\ell = \|\epsilon-\hat\epsilon\|^2$ and backpropagate to update $\theta$.  

Training details: Adam optimizer, learning rate $10^{-4}$, batch size 64, noise steps $T=1000$. Training for 200k iterations.  

5. Sampling and Fine‐Tuning Pipeline  
At deployment on a new task with few examples $\mathcal D_{\mathrm{new}}$:  
a. Compute task descriptor $c_{\mathrm{new}}$ and embed into $e_{\mathrm{new}}$.  
b. Initialize $w_T\sim\mathcal N(0,I)$.  
c. For $t=T \downarrow 1$ do:  
   $$w_{t-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}}\Bigl(w_t - \frac{1-\alpha_t}{\sqrt{1-\bar\alpha_t}}\,\epsilon_\theta(w_t,t,e_{\mathrm{new}})\Bigr) + \sigma_t z,\quad z\sim\mathcal N(0,I),$$  
   where $\sigma_t^2 = \frac{1-\alpha_t}{1-\bar\alpha_t}(1-\bar\alpha_{t-1})$.  
d. Denormalize $w_0 = \mu + \sigma\odot w_0$.  
e. Reshape into layer arrays $\{W^{(l)}\}$ and fine‐tune for $K$ steps on $\mathcal D_{\mathrm{new}}$ with a small learning rate ($1e$-4).

c. Metrics  
   – Convergence speed: number of fine-tuning epochs or gradient steps to reach $90\%$ of fully trained accuracy.  
   – Few-shot generalization: test accuracy after $K=10$ or $100$ examples.  
   – Computational cost: GPU-hours and FLOPs to reach target performance.  
   – Novelty of generated weights: average pairwise cosine similarity against training weights; lower indicates less memorization.  

d. Ablations  
   – Effect of $T$, noise schedule, and architecture variants (MLP vs. transformer‐based denoiser).  
   – Impact of task embedding dimension $E$ and conditioning mechanism (concatenation vs. FiLM).  
   – Role of symmetry modules: with and without permutation equivariance.  

Expected Outcomes & Impact  
1. Empirical Gains  
   – 2×–5× faster convergence relative to random initialization across vision and language tasks.  
   – Improved few-shot accuracy by 5–10 percentage points versus meta-learning baselines.  
   – Significant reduction in wall-clock training time (20–50% savings in GPU-hours).  

2. Theoretical Insights  
   – Characterization of weight distributions across tasks: modes, covariance structure, and symmetry subspaces.  
   – Analysis of generalization bounds for generated initializations, extending theories on neural collapse [7] and permutation‐based universality [5].  

3. Broader Impacts  
   – Democratization of high-performance models by lowering computational barriers.  
   – Environmental benefits from reduced energy consumption in model training.  
   – New tools for understanding model lineage, interpretability, and synthetic weight sampling for robustness testing (e.g., backdoor detection).  

4. Foundations for Future Work  
   – Extensible framework for continual weight generation as new tasks emerge.  
   – Integration with neural architecture search: jointly generate architecture plus weights.  
   – Applications in scientific computing where implicit neural representations require fast, domain‐adapted initializations.  

By establishing a robust protocol for task‐conditioned diffusion in weight space, this proposal aims to catalyze research in weight‐space learning, bridging gaps between theoretical foundations and practical generative methods, and ultimately enabling on-demand synthesis of high-quality neural models.
