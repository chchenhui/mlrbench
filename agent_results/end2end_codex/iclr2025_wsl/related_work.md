**2. Key Challenges:**

1. **Overfitting in Weight Space Models**: Weight space models often suffer from substantial overfitting due to the lack of diversity in training datasets, as highlighted in "Improved Generalization of Weight Space Networks via Augmentations" (2024).

2. **Memorization in Generative Models**: Current generative models for neural network weights tend to memorize training data, producing replicas or simple interpolations rather than novel weights, as discussed in "Generative Modeling of Weights: Generalization or Memorization?" (2025).

3. **Scalability to Larger Models**: Developing weight-space learning methods that are scalable to larger neural network models with varying architectures remains a significant challenge, as addressed in "Towards Scalable and Versatile Weight Space Learning" (2024).

4. **Capturing Symmetries in Weight Space**: Effectively designing architectures that account for the unique symmetry structures of deep weight spaces, such as permutation symmetry, is complex, as explored in "Equivariant Architectures for Learning in Deep Weight Spaces" (2023).

5. **Efficient Representation of RNN Weights**: Learning useful representations of recurrent neural network weight matrices that facilitate analysis and downstream tasks is challenging, as investigated in "Learning Useful Representations of Recurrent Neural Network Weight Matrices" (2024).
