**Key Challenges:**

1. **Uncertainty Estimation**: Accurately quantifying and interpreting the AI system's uncertainty in user preferences is complex, impacting the effectiveness of active learning strategies.

2. **Dynamic User Preferences**: User values and preferences can evolve over time, necessitating continuous adaptation of the AI system to maintain alignment.

3. **Human-AI Communication**: Developing intuitive interfaces for effective communication of uncertainties and alternative actions between humans and AI systems remains a significant challenge.

4. **Scalability**: Implementing co-adaptive frameworks that efficiently scale to diverse applications and large user bases without excessive computational or human resource demands is difficult.

5. **Trust and Transparency**: Ensuring that the AI system's decision-making processes are transparent and that users trust the system's recommendations is crucial for successful co-adaptation.
