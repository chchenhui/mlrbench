Title
Adaptive Monte Carlo Sampling for Real-Time Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models

Introduction
Background  
Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models have transformed natural language processing and related fields, delivering human-level fluency across generation, summarization, translation, and decision support. Yet in high-stakes domains—healthcare, law, finance, autonomous systems—overconfident predictions or undetected hallucinations can lead to severe real-world consequences. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) bridges this trust gap by providing calibrated confidence estimates, enabling users to know when to trust model outputs and when to seek human oversight.

Research Objectives  
This project aims to develop a scalable, on-the-fly uncertainty estimator for autoregressive LLMs that:
1. Maintains ensemble-level calibration (Expected Calibration Error, ECE < 2%).  
2. Detects hallucinations with high precision and recall (F1 > 0.8).  
3. Reduces inference cost by at least 50% compared to full Monte Carlo (MC) dropout or ensemble methods.  

Significance  
Existing UQ approaches (full MC dropout, ensembles, perturbation-based sampling) either demand excessive compute or sacrifice detection performance. By introducing a compute-adaptive, two-stage estimator—composed of a lightweight “certainty gate” and targeted MC dropout—this research will enable real-time, resource-efficient UQ. The outcome will directly benefit critical applications where immediate, trustworthy model feedback is non-negotiable.

Related Work
SPUQ (Gao et al., 2024) uses input perturbations to separate aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, halving ECE at the cost of multiple forward passes per perturbation. Inv-Entropy (Song et al., 2025) models input–output transitions as Markov chains, offering a fully probabilistic UQ framework but with high overhead for chain construction. LUQ (Zhang et al., 2024) targets long generations via ensemble selection, boosting factuality correlation but relying on multiple model runs. RAUQ (Vazhentsev et al., 2025) analyzes attention head patterns for single-pass scoring, yet its unsupervised signals can misclassify token semantics. Grewal et al. (2024) leverage semantic embeddings for smooth UQ estimates but still require amortization steps. Other works—fact‐checking pipelines (Fadeeva et al., 2024), supervised hidden-activation methods (Liu et al., 2024), and clinical UQ frameworks (Chen et al., 2024)—highlight the pressing trade-off between calibration, detection, and efficiency. None, however, offer a dynamic gating mechanism that selectively applies expensive sampling when needed.

Methodology
Overview  
We propose a two-stage, compute-adaptive uncertainty estimator for autoregressive decoders:

Stage 1 – Certainty Gate  
• Input: token logits $\ell_t\in\mathbb{R}^V$ and hidden‐state summary $h_t\in\mathbb{R}^d$ at decoding step $t$.  
• Gate network $\mathcal{G}\!:\!(h_t,\ell_t)\rightarrow[0,1]$ outputs “uncertainty score” $u_t$.  
• If $u_t < \tau$ (learned threshold), emit top-1 token $\hat{y}_t=\arg\max \mathrm{softmax}(\ell_t)$ with calibrated confidence $c_t$.  
• Else, trigger Stage 2.

Stage 2 – Targeted Monte Carlo Dropout  
• Perform $M$ stochastic forward passes with dropout enabled at attention and feed-forward layers.  
• Collect probability distributions $\{p_{t}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^M$ for each candidate token.  
• Estimate variance  
  $$\hat\sigma^2_t = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M \bigl\|p_{t}^{(i)} - \bar p_t\bigr\|_2^2,\quad \bar p_t=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M p_{t}^{(i)}.$$  
• Define refined confidence $c_t = 1 - \frac{\hat\sigma_t}{\max\hat\sigma}$. Emit $\hat{y}_t=\arg\max\bar p_t$.

Gate Training  
1. Offline dataset $\mathcal{D}$: representative sequences (QA, summarization, medical dialog).  
2. For each token in $\mathcal{D}$, compute true variance labels $\sigma^2_t$ via full MC dropout ($M_0=20$ passes).  
3. Train $\mathcal{G}$ as binary classifier to predict $\{\sigma^2_t > \theta\}$ using cross‐entropy:  
   $$\mathcal{L} = -\sum_t y_t\log \mathcal{G}(h_t,\ell_t) + (1-y_t)\log\bigl(1-\mathcal{G}(h_t,\ell_t)\bigr),$$  
   where $y_t=1$ if $\sigma^2_t>\theta$.

Mathematical Formulation  
Let $\pi_\phi$ denote the base LLM parameterized by $\phi$. For input prefix $x_{<t}$, the single‐pass output is  
$$\ell_t = \mathrm{LM}(x_{<t};\phi),\quad p_t = \mathrm{softmax}(\ell_t).$$  
Denote the gate network parameters by $\psi$. The overall token‐level uncertainty estimate is  
$$\hat U_t(x_{<t}) = 
   \begin{cases}
     \mathcal{G}_\psi(h_t,\ell_t), & \mathcal{G}_\psi(h_t,\ell_t) < \tau, \\
     \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M \mathrm{Var}\bigl(\pi_\phi(x_{<t},\cdot;\phi,\mathrm{drop})\bigr), & \text{otherwise}.
   \end{cases}$$  

Calibration  
After obtaining confidence scores $c_t$, we apply temperature scaling or isotonic regression on a held‐out calibration set $\mathcal{C}$ to minimize ECE:  
$$\hat T = \arg\min_T \sum_{(q,y)\in\mathcal{C}} \bigl(\mathrm{Acc}(q,y)-\sigma(T\,\logit(c_t))\bigr)^2,$$  
where $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the sigmoid, and $\mathrm{Acc}(q,y)$ is the empirical correctness.
