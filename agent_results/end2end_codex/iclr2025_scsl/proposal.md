Title  
AutoSpurDetect: Automated Detection and Robustification of Unknown Spurious Correlations in Multimodal Models  

1. Introduction  
Background and Motivation  
Machine learning models—especially large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs)—often exploit easy-to-learn, noncausal patterns (“shortcuts”) instead of reasoning over true causal structure. This simplicity bias leads to spurious correlations: model predictions overly depend on incidental features that hold only in the training distribution. When deployed in safety-critical or under-represented settings (medical imaging, social applications, geographical data), these hidden shortcuts cause dramatic failures and fairness issues. Current robustness benchmarks rely on manually annotated group labels or known spurious factors, which is neither scalable nor guaranteed to cover hidden correlations. There is an urgent need for an end-to-end, automated pipeline that (i) discovers unknown spurious features across modalities, (ii) constructs comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, and (iii) robustifies models via minimal performance trade-offs.  

Research Objectives  
AutoSpurDetect aims to:  
1. Automatically identify latent feature clusters in image, text, and audio data that potentially induce spurious model behavior.  
2. Generate feature-specific counterfactual examples via pretrained generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion for images, GPT-4 for text, neural TTS for audio).  
3. Quantify model sensitivity to each latent cluster and assemble a multimodal “SpurBench” benchmark.  
4. Introduce an adversarial consistency training scheme to mitigate reliance on high-sensitivity clusters.  

Significance  
By providing a fully automated workflow, AutoSpurDetect removes human bottlenecks in spurious-correlation detection and scales across data types. The resulting SpurBench benchmark will allow rigorous comparison of robustness methods without manual group labels. The proposed robustification will improve invariance properties of foundation models with negligible accuracy degradation. This work addresses core questions about how deep models learn and unlearn spurious patterns, offering both theoretical insight and practical tools for dependable AI.  

2. Methodology  
Overview  
AutoSpurDetect consists of three main components:  
A. Latent Feature Clustering  
B. Counterfactual Generation and Sensitivity Scoring  
C. Adversarial Consistency Training  

A. Latent Feature Clustering  
1. Data and Encoders  
   • Image data: use pretrained Vision Encoders (e.g., CLIP‐ViT, ResNet50).  
   • Text data: use BERT‐base or GPT-4 embeddings.  
   • Audio data: use Wav2Vec2 or HuBERT features.  
2. Feature Extraction  
   For each sample $x$, extract an intermediate representation $h=f_{\text{enc}}(x)\in\mathbb{R}^d$.  
3. Dimensionality Reduction  
   Apply PCA or UMAP to project $\{h\}$ into $\mathbb{R}^k$ ($k\ll d$) to capture major axes of variation.  
4. Clustering  
   Perform K-means or Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering on reduced features:  
   $$\{\mu_j\}_{j=1}^K = \arg\min_{\mu_1,\dots,\mu_K} \sum_{i=1}^N \min_j \|z_i - \mu_j\|^2\,,\quad z_i\in\mathbb{R}^k.$$  
   Each cluster $C_j = \{x_i: \text{cluster}(z_i)=j\}$ is hypothesized to correspond to a latent feature group.  
5. Cluster Validation  
   To choose $K$, use silhouette score or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for GMM, ensuring clusters capture meaningful variation but avoid fragmentation.  

B. Counterfactual Generation and Sensitivity Scoring  
1. Counterfactual Generation  
   For each cluster $C_j$, generate perturbed samples $\tilde{x}_i^{(j)}$ that remove or alter the cluster-specific feature while preserving overall semantics.  
   • Images: Use Stable Diffusion with region-guided masks derived from GradCAM attention to edit or erase cluster-correlated regions.  
   • Text: Invoke GPT-4 to paraphrase or drop tokens empirically associated with cluster $j$. Prompt template: “Rewrite this sentence without referring to [feature].”  
   • Audio: Use neural TTS to synthesize speech or environmental sounds with altered pitch, gender, or background noise characteristics.  
2. Sensitivity Metric  
   Given a target model $g(\cdot;\theta)$ trained on the original dataset, compute prediction shift:  
   $$S_j = \mathbb{E}_{x\in C_j}\big[D\big(g(x),\,g(\tilde{x}^{(j)})\big)\big]$$  
   where $D(p,q)$ is a divergence measure (e.g., KL divergence for softmax outputs or $\ell_2$ distance for embeddings). A large $S_j$ implies reliance on features in cluster $j$.  
3. Flagging Spurious Clusters  
   Define threshold $\tau$ (e.g., the 90th percentile of $\{S_j\}$) to select spurious clusters:  
   $$\mathcal{S} = \{j : S_j \ge \tau\}\,.$$  
4. Benchmark Construction (SpurBench)  
   Construct a test set $$\mathcal{B} = \bigcup_{j\in\mathcal{S}}\{(x,\tilde{x}^{(j)},y)\}\,,$$  
   recording model performance on unperturbed and perturbed inputs. SpurBench includes:  
   • Clean accuracy $A_{\text{clean}} = \Pr[g(x)=y]$.  
   • Robust accuracy $A_{\text{robust}} = \Pr[g(\tilde{x})=y]$.  
   • Worst-cluster drop $\Delta_{\max}=\max_{j\in\mathcal{S}}|g(x)-g(\tilde{x}^{(j)})|$.  

C. Adversarial Consistency Training  
1. Loss Formulation  
   To mitigate reliance on spurious clusters, we augment training with counterfactuals and enforce prediction consistency:  
   $$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)}\Big[\ell_{\mathrm{CE}}(g(x;\theta),y)\Big] + \lambda\,\mathbb{E}_{j\in\mathcal{S}}\mathbb{E}_{x\in C_j}\Big[\ell_{\mathrm{cons}}\big(g(x;\theta),\,g(\tilde{x}^{(j)};\theta)\big)\Big]$$  
   where  
   - $\ell_{\mathrm{CE}}$ is cross‐entropy;  
   - $\ell_{\mathrm{cons}}(p,q)=D(p,q)$ enforces output invariance;  
   - $\lambda>0$ balances accuracy vs. invariance.  
2. Training Procedure  
   • At each minibatch, sample a fraction $\alpha$ of examples from spurious clusters; generate on-the-fly counterfactuals.  
   • Compute $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$ and update via SGD or Adam.  
3. Hyperparameter Selection  
   • Tune $\lambda$ and $\alpha$ by grid search on a validation split of SpurBench.  
   • Monitor both clean and robust accuracy to avoid over-regularization.  

Experimental Design  
Datasets & Tasks  
We will evaluate on four representative multimodal tasks:  
1. Visual Question Answering (VQA v2) – image+text.  
2. Image classification (Waterbirds, CelebA) – focus on watermark and background spuriousness.  
3. Sentiment analysis with audio-text pairs (MOSI, MOSEI).  
4. Medical imaging (chest X-rays) – spurious features: device markers or patient position.  

Baselines  
• Standard fine-tuning.  
• Group DRO (Sagawa et al. 2020).  
• Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM, Arjovsky et al. 2019).  
• Causal Logit Perturbation (Zhou et al. 2025).  
• RaVL region-aware debiasing (Varma et al. 2024).  

Evaluation Metrics  
• Clean accuracy $A_{\text{clean}}$.  
• Robust accuracy $A_{\text{robust}}$.  
• Worst-group accuracy (minimum accuracy across clusters).  
• Sensitivity reduction $\Delta S = \frac1{|\mathcal{S}|}\sum_{j\in\mathcal{S}} (S_j^{\text{pre}} - S_j^{\text{post}})$.  
• Fairness gap (accuracy difference between majority vs. minority clusters).  

Ablation Studies  
1. Vary number of clusters $K\in\{5,10,20\}$.  
2. Use alternative divergence $D$ (MSE vs. KL).  
3. Vary generative model fidelity (e.g., different diffusion checkpoints).  
4. Effects of $\lambda$ and $\alpha$ on stability trade-offs.  

Statistical Analysis  
Perform paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to assess significance of improvements in robust and worst-group accuracy (p<0.05).  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate the following outcomes:  
1. Automated Discovery of Spurious Features  
   AutoSpurDetect will unveil previously hidden shortcuts in multiple modalities, demonstrating that 30–50% of high-sensitivity clusters correspond to noncausal patterns.  
2. SpurBench: A Scalable Multimodal Benchmark  
   The SpurBench suite will cover diverse tasks and provide the community with a unified organization of clean vs. perturbed pairs, enabling fair comparison of robustness methods without manual group labels.  
3. Improved Robustness via Adversarial Consistency  
   Models trained with our consistency loss will achieve:  
   • 10%–20% absolute gain in robust accuracy over vanilla fine-tuning.  
   • 5%–15% increase in worst-group accuracy compared to Group DRO and IRM.  
   • Minimal (<2%) drop in clean accuracy when $\lambda$ is properly tuned.  
4. Insights into Learning Dynamics  
   By quantifying sensitivity reduction over training epochs, we will shed light on how SGD and margin maximization interact with shortcut features, complementing recent theoretical work (Zeitouni et al. 2023).  

Broader Impacts  
• Dependable AI: Our pipeline enables practitioners to certify model invariance against unknown shortcuts, crucial for high-stake domains (healthcare, finance, safety).  
• Research Catalyst: SpurBench and open-source code will spur development of novel robustification techniques and theoretical studies of spurious correlation.  
• Ethical Deployment: By detecting hidden biases, we reduce the risk of unfair treatment of minority or under-represented groups in vision, language, and audio applications.  

Conclusion  
AutoSpurDetect addresses the foundational challenge of unknown spurious correlations by uniting automated discovery, benchmark creation, and robust training into a single framework. Through extensive empirical validation and theoretical analysis, this proposal promises to advance our understanding of how deep models latch onto shortcuts and, more importantly, how to steer them toward genuine causal reasoning.
