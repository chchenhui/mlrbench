Title:  
AutoIssue: A Retrieval-Augmented Reinforcement Learning Agent for Autonomous GitHub Issue Resolution  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Open-source software development relies heavily on issue tracking systems such as GitHub Issues. While maintainers manually triage, annotate, and resolve incoming bug reports and feature requests, this process is often time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human error. Recent advances in deep learning for code—especially in agentic methods, reinforcement learning, and human-in-the-loop alignment—offer the promise of end-to-end automation of issue resolution. However, existing systems either focus on code generation in isolation (e.g., CodeT5 or Copilot), multi-agent collaboration for high-level planning (e.g., ChatDev, CodePori), or reinforcement learning from unit tests alone (e.g., RLTF). A unified framework that 1) retrieves relevant historical fixes, 2) generates candidate patches, and 3) refines them via execution feedback and human preference remains unexplored.  

Research Objectives  
We propose AutoIssue, a two-stage framework for autonomous GitHub issue resolution. Our objectives are:  
• To pretrain a retrieval-augmented generative model on large-scale issue–PR histories, enabling the agent to leverage past examples.  
• To fine-tune this model via reinforcement learning in a simulated GitHub environment, using a composite reward from test outcomes, static analysis, and human preference (RLHF).  
• To design a gated controller that iteratively drafts and validates patches until they meet predefined quality thresholds.  
• To evaluate AutoIssue on active open-source repositories, measuring acceptance rate, resolution latency, and code maintainability.  

Significance  
AutoIssue aims to accelerate issue resolution, reduce developer workload, and improve code quality. By combining retrieval, generation, and reinforcement learning with human feedback, we offer a blueprint for responsibly deploying agentic systems in software engineering. Moreover, by open-sourcing our dataset, code, and pretrained models, we adhere to open science and responsible AI practices, fostering transparency and reproducibility.  

2. Methodology  
Our methodology comprises four components: data collection, pretraining, reinforcement learning fine-tuning, and experimental evaluation.  

2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
We construct IssuePR-1M, a dataset of one million (issue, patch) pairs drawn from popular GitHub repositories in Python, JavaScript, and Java. Selection criteria: repositories with ≥1,000 stars and active CI pipelines. For each pair:  
• issue_text: original issue description, comments, and metadata (labels, timestamps).  
• code_context: snapshot of the affected files at issue creation time.  
• patch_code: diff applied in the merged PR.  
• test_suite: associated unit/integration tests at that commit.  
Preprocessing steps:  
1. Normalize code (remove whitespace diffs, unify line endings).  
2. Tokenize with a code-aware tokenizer (e.g., byte-pair encoding plus language tokens).  
3. Extract test cases and static analyzer configurations.  
Split the data into 80% training, 10% validation, 10% test, ensuring no overlap of repositories across splits.  

2.2 Stage 1: Retrieval-Augmented Pretraining  
We adopt a sequence-to-sequence transformer model (e.g., CodeT5 or CodeGen). To enhance context, we build a dual-encoder retrieval system:  
• Issue Encoder $f_I(\cdot)$ and Patch Encoder $f_P(\cdot)$ map token sequences to dense vectors $e_I,e_P\in\mathbb{R}^d$.  
• Similarity score:  
  $$\mathrm{sim}(e_I,e_P)=\frac{e_I^\top e_P}{\|e_I\|\;\|e_P\|}\,. $$  
For each training example $(I,C,P)$:  
1. Retrieve top-$k$ similar past patches $\{P_j\}_{j=1}^k$ by highest $\mathrm{sim}(f_I(I),f_P(P_j))$.  
2. Construct input sequence:  
   \[ \mathrm{<SOS>} \;I\;\|\|\;C\;\|\|\;\mathrm{<SEP>}\;\|\|\;P_1\;\|\|\ldots\|\|\;P_k\;\mathrm{<EOS>}. \]  
3. Train the generative model to maximize log-likelihood of $P$ given this enriched input:  
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ML}} = -\sum_{t=1}^{|P|} \log p_\phi(p_t \mid p_{<t}, I, C, \{P_j\})\,. $$  

2.3 Stage 2: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning  
We simulate a GitHub environment $\mathcal{E}$ where at each episode the agent observes a state $s_t=(I_t,C_t,D_t)$: the issue description $I_t$, codebase $C_t$, and test suite $D_t$. The agent’s action $a_t$ is a proposed patch $\Delta C_t$. Upon applying $\Delta C_t$, we run:  
• Unit/Integration tests: output pass rate $r_{\mathrm{test}}\in[0,1]$.  
• Static analyzers (e.g., ESLint, pylint): normalized score $r_{\mathrm{lint}}\in[0,1]$.  
• Occasional human preference signals $r_{\mathrm{human}}\in\{-1,0,1\}$ collected via small-scale pairwise comparisons.  
We define a composite reward:  
$$R_t = \alpha\,r_{\mathrm{test}} + \beta\,r_{\mathrm{lint}} + \gamma\,r_{\mathrm{human}},$$  
with hyperparameters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ tuned on the validation set. We use an actor-critic algorithm: the policy network $\pi_\theta(a_t\mid s_t)$ and value function $V_w(s_t)$. The objective is to maximize expected cumulative reward:  
$$J(\theta)=\mathbb{E}_{\tau\sim\pi_\theta}\bigg[\sum_{t=0}^T R_t\bigg],$$  
with gradient  
$$\nabla_\theta J(\theta)\approx \sum_{t=0}^T \nabla_\theta \log\pi_\theta(a_t\mid s_t)\bigl(R_t+\gamma V_w(s_{t+1})-V_w(s_t)\bigr).$$  
We alternate between policy updates via generalized advantage estimation (GAE) and value function regression to minimize  
$$\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{critic}} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{t}\bigl(V_w(s_t)-(R_t+\gamma V_w(s_{t+1}))\bigr)^2\,. $$  

2.4 Gated Iterative Controller  
To ensure patches meet quality thresholds, we wrap the RL agent in a gated controller:  
Algorithm 1: Gated Patch Generator  
1. Initialize state $s_0=(I,C,D)$, iteration $i=0$.  
2. Repeat until $R_i\ge\delta$ or $i\ge N_{\max}$:  
   a. Sample patch $\Delta C_i\sim\pi_\theta(\cdot\mid s_i)$.  
   b. Apply $\Delta C_i$ to $C_i\to C_{i+1}$ and compute $R_i$.  
   c. If $R_i<\delta$, set $s_{i+1}=(I,C_{i+1},D)$, $i\leftarrow i+1$.  
3. If $R_i\ge\delta$, open PR automatically; else, flag for human review.  

Here $N_{\max}$ is the maximum drafting attempts and $\delta$ is the minimum acceptable reward.  

2.5 Experimental Design  
Datasets & Baselines  
• Datasets: IssuePR-1M test split; additional 100 unseen repositories.  
• Baselines:  
  – Retrieval-only (no learning after pretraining).  
  – Generation-only ML model (no RL fine-tuning).  
  – RLTF (unit-test RL only).  
  – AutoDev style agent (without retrieval and gated controller).  

Evaluation Metrics  
• Fix Acceptance Rate: proportion of generated PRs merged by maintainers.  
• Test Pass Rate: percentage of test cases passing after patch.  
• Linter Score Improvement: normalized change in static analysis warnings.  
• Latency: time between issue creation and PR submission.  
• Maintainability: cyclomatic complexity change, code smell count.  
• Human Evaluation: developer satisfaction rated on a 5-point Likert scale in a small user study.  

Statistical Analysis  
We will perform paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests between AutoIssue and each baseline on key metrics. Ablation studies will isolate the impact of retrieval ($k=0$ vs. $k>0$), RL fine-tuning (with vs. without RLHF), and the gated controller ($N_{\max}=1$ vs. $N_{\max}>1$).  

Implementation Details  
• Model architecture: 12-layer transformer encoder and decoder with 768 hidden units and 12 attention heads.  
• Training: AdamW optimizer, initial learning rate $5\times10^{-5}$ for ML pretraining, $1\times10^{-6}$ for RL fine-tuning.  
• Hardware: 16 A100 GPUs.  
• Code & Data Release: under MIT license on GitHub.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
AutoIssue is expected to:  
1. Achieve a fix acceptance rate ≥60% on the test split, outperforming all baselines by ≥15 percentage points.  
2. Reduce median resolution latency by 40% compared to human triage.  
3. Improve code maintainability, evidenced by a ≥20% reduction in linter warnings and neutral or positive changes in cyclomatic complexity.  
4. Earn developer satisfaction scores averaging ≥4.0/5.0 in user studies.  

Impact on Research & Practice  
• Developer Productivity: By autonomously resolving common issues, AutoIssue can free developers to focus on higher-order design and feature work.  
• Benchmark for Agentic Code Models: We will publish IssuePR-1M as a new benchmark for issue resolution tasks, stimulating future research in deep learning for code.  
• Responsible AI & Open Science: Our open-source release, accompanied by a detailed datasheet and model card, will advance transparency and ethical deployment practices.  
• Generalization to Other Software Tasks: The two-stage framework (retrieval + RLHF) can be extended to tasks such as code translation, program repair, and API migration.  

Societal & Ethical Considerations  
We will implement safeguards to prevent the automatic introduction of security vulnerabilities by incorporating static security analyzers into the reward. All generated PRs will require human review for critical repositories. Data collection will respect license terms and contributor privacy by anonymizing user handles.  

Timeline  
Month 1–3: Data collection & preprocessing; retrieval encoder training.

In summary, AutoIssue offers a comprehensive, reproducible framework for autonomous GitHub issue resolution by uniting retrieval-based pretraining, reinforcement learning from execution and human feedback, and a robust gated controller. This proposal addresses key challenges in agentic programming tasks and aligns tightly with the DL4C workshop’s themes of emergent possibilities, developer productivity, responsible AI, and benchmarking in deep learning for code.
