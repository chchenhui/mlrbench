Title  
Adaptive Deprecation Score: A Lifecycle Management Framework for ML Data Repositories  

Introduction  
Machine learning (ML) research and applications are increasingly driven by the availability of large, diverse datasets. From foundational pre-training corpora to benchmark suites, datasets sit at the core of model development, evaluation, and deployment. However, the “dataset lifecycle” is rarely managed with the same rigor as code or models. Datasets may accumulate hidden biases, outlive their original licensing agreements, adopt obsolete formats, or diverge from FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. In the absence of standardized deprecation procedures, flawed datasets remain in circulation, causing irreproducible results, ethical breaches, and wasted researcher effort.  

Recent literature highlights:  
• The need for end-to-end dataset versioning and provenance tracking (VeML [Le et al., 2023], Atlas [Spoczynski et al., 2025]).  
• Frameworks for standardizing deprecation protocols (Luccioni et al., 2021).  
• Challenges in ML asset management and the gap between data lifecycle theory and practice (Empirical Study, 2024).  

Research Objectives  
1. Define an interpretable Deprecation Score for ML datasets that dynamically integrates multiple lifecycle signals.  
2. Design and implement an automated pipeline to compute and update Deprecation Scores across a live data repository (e.g., Hugging Face Datasets or OpenML).  
3. Establish notification and user-interface mechanisms (badges, alerts) that encourage timely maintenance or deprecation.  
4. Evaluate the framework on historical and synthetic repository data, measuring its accuracy, timeliness, and impact on downstream model reproducibility.  

Significance  
A reliable, adaptive deprecation mechanism will:  
– Reduce the inadvertent use of flawed or out-of-date datasets.  
– Improve reproducibility and ethical compliance in ML research.  
– Incentivize dataset maintainers to keep data current and well-documented.  
– Serve as a blueprint for best practices in ML data governance.  

Methodology  
We propose a four-stage system: Data Ingestion, Signal Extraction, Deprecation Scoring, and Notification & Visualization.  

1. Data Ingestion  
• Metadata Harvesting: Periodic retrieval of dataset metadata (creation date, format, schema, license) via repository APIs.  
• Community Feedback Collection: Ingestion of issue tracker entries, pull requests, and forum discussions associated with each dataset.  
• Usage & Citation Tracking: Scraping citation indices (e.g., Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar) to record how often and how recently a dataset appears in publications.  

2. Signal Extraction  
We define five primary signal categories. Each yields a normalized score in $[0,1]$, where 1 indicates high risk (strong evidence for deprecation).  

2.1 Citation Age Signal ($S_\mathrm{cite}$)  
Let $c_t$ be the number of citations in the most recent year $t$, and $\bar c$ the average annual citation count over the dataset’s lifetime. We define  
$$
S_\mathrm{cite} = \exp\bigl(-\alpha\,\frac{c_t}{\bar c+\epsilon}\bigr)
$$  
where $\alpha>0$ controls the decay rate and $\epsilon$ avoids division by zero. A small $c_t$ relative to past usage yields a score toward 1.  

2.2 Update Frequency Signal ($S_\mathrm{upd}$)  
Given the timestamps of the last $k$ releases $T = \{t_1,\dots,t_k\}$, compute the average inter‐release interval $\Delta = (t_k - t_1)/(k-1)$. Let $\Delta_\mathrm{max}$ be a repository‐wide upper bound (e.g., the 95th percentile of all intervals). Then  
$$
S_\mathrm{upd} = \min\Bigl(1,\;\frac{\Delta}{\Delta_\mathrm{max}}\Bigr).
$$  

2.3 Community Issue Signal ($S_\mathrm{iss}$)  
From issue tracker data, let $I_{\mathrm{open}}$ = # open issues tagged “bug,” “bias,” “license,” etc., and $I_{\mathrm{closed}}$ the # of closed ones in the past year. Define  
$$
S_\mathrm{iss} = \frac{I_{\mathrm{open}}}{I_{\mathrm{open}} + I_{\mathrm{closed}} + \epsilon}.
$$  

2.4 Reproducibility Failure Signal ($S_\mathrm{rep}$)  
We run a suite of automated benchmarks on the dataset. Let $m$ be the number of benchmark tasks (e.g., training a standard model, computing fairness metrics), and let $f$ be the count of failed tasks (e.g., degradation beyond a tolerance). Then  
$$
S_\mathrm{rep} = \frac{f}{m}.
$$  

2.5 FAIR‐Compliance Drift ($S_\mathrm{fair}$)  
We track adherence to FAIR criteria over time. Let $p$ be the proportion of criteria currently satisfied, and $p_0$ the baseline at publication. Then  
$$
S_\mathrm{fair} = \max\bigl(0,\,(1 - p)/(1 - p_0 + \epsilon)\bigr).
$$  

3. Deprecation Scoring  
We combine these signals into a single Deprecation Score $D$:  
$$
D = \sum_{i \in \{\mathrm{cite,upd,iss,rep,fair}\}} w_i \, S_i
$$  
with weights $w_i\ge0$ summing to 1. We will learn or tune $w_i$ via historical data on known deprecations. For example, given a training set of datasets annotated as “deprecated” or “active,” we can solve:  
$$
\min_{w_i} \sum_{d\,\in\,\mathcal D} \bigl( D(d) - y_d \bigr)^2 + \lambda \|w\|^2
$$  
subject to $\sum_i w_i=1,\; w_i\ge0$, where $y_d\in\{0,1\}$ is ground truth.  

Thresholding and Classification  
We set two thresholds $\tau_\mathrm{warn} < \tau_\mathrm{dep}$:  
• $D\ge\tau_\mathrm{warn}$ triggers a “Use with Caution” badge.  
• $D\ge\tau_\mathrm{dep}$ labels the dataset as a “Deprecation Candidate” and alerts maintainers.  

4. Notification & Visualization  
• Repository UI Integration: Datasets in search results show badges (green/amber/red) depending on $D$.  
• Automated Alerts: Email or dashboard notifications to dataset maintainers when $D\ge\tau_\mathrm{warn}$.  
• Community Dashboard: Aggregate statistics on deprecation scores across the repository, trending signals, and historical score trajectories.  

Experimental Design  
Dataset Selection  
– Retrospective Evaluation: Collect a set of 200 datasets from OpenML and Hugging Face that have been officially deprecated (per repository logs) and 200 that remain active.  
– Synthetic Aging: Introduce artificial drift by programmatically injecting schema changes, format corruptions, and deprecated licenses into a subset.  

Weight Tuning and Validation  
– Split deprecated/active datasets 70% train, 30% test.  
– Learn weights $w_i$ and thresholds $\tau_\mathrm{warn}, \tau_\mathrm{dep}$ on the training split.  
– Evaluate on test split using ROC‐AUC, precision, recall at both thresholds.  

Ablation Studies  
– Remove each signal $S_i$ in turn to measure its marginal impact on classification performance.  
– Compare linear combination against nonlinear models (e.g., random forest over $S_i$) to test interpretability vs. performance trade-offs.  

Downstream Impact Assessment  
• Reproducibility Task: For 50 research papers that used deprecated datasets, re-run key experiments replacing the deprecated dataset with an updated or alternative one. Measure differences in reported performance.  
• User Study: Survey 30 ML practitioners before and after UI integration to assess whether deprecation badges affect dataset choice and confidence.  
• Repository Health Metrics: Track the rate of dataset maintenance actions (updates, issue closures) for datasets flagged as “Use with Caution” vs. unflagged controls over a 6-month period.  

Evaluation Metrics  
– Deprecation Detection: ROC‐AUC, precision@k, recall@k.  
– Alert Timeliness: Median time from crossing threshold to maintainer response.  
– Downstream Reproducibility Improvement: Fraction of experiments successfully reproduced or corrected.  
– User Confidence: Likert‐scale survey responses pre/post integration.  

Expected Outcomes & Impact  
1. A fully implemented Deprecation Scoring system integrated into an open ML data repository with interactive badges and alerting.  
2. Empirical evidence showing that adaptive scoring accurately predicts deprecated datasets (target ROC‐AUC > 0.9) and leads to faster maintainer engagement (target median response reduction by 30%).  
3. Demonstrable reduction in downstream reproducibility failures for models trained on flagged datasets, evaluated on real-world papers.  
4. Publication of a best-practice guideline and open‐source toolkit for dataset lifecycle management, including code for signal extraction, scoring, and UI components.  

Long-Term Impact  
• Establishment of industry standards for dataset deprecation and lifecycle management.  
• Encouragement of a culture shift in ML research: data viewed as a living artifact requiring ongoing stewardship.  
• Enhanced ethical compliance and model reliability as flawed datasets are identified and remediated early.  
• A scalable framework that can be adopted by other data repositories, fostering a federated ecosystem of well‐maintained, FAIR, and ethically sound datasets.
