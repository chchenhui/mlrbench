Title: Adaptive Deprecation Scoring and Notification for ML Data Repositories

Motivation:  
ML datasets often outlive their usefulness, harboring hidden biases, licensing conflicts, or obsolete formats. Without standardized deprecation procedures, researchers unknowingly build on flawed data, undermining reproducibility and ethical compliance. An adaptive, automated approach to dataset lifecycle management can reduce misuse and signal when datasets need retirement or revision.

Main Idea:  
We propose developing a Deprecation Score—an interpretable metric that combines signals such as citation age, update frequency, community-reported issues (e.g., licensing disputes, bias flags), reproducibility failures, and FAIR-compliance drift. Each dataset in a repository (e.g., Hugging Face, OpenML) is regularly evaluated via an automated pipeline:  
1. Data ingestion of metadata and user feedback;  
2. Static analyses (format checks, schema evolution);  
3. Dynamic tests (benchmark reproducibility, fairness audits);  
4. Community sentiment mining from issue trackers.  

When a dataset’s Deprecation Score crosses a threshold, it is automatically tagged “Deprecation Candidate,” triggers an email alert to maintainers, and surfaces a “Use with Caution” badge in search results. Expected outcomes include fewer downstream failures, clearer data governance, and incentivized dataset maintenance. This system can serve as a blueprint for holistic dataset lifecycles across ML repositories.
