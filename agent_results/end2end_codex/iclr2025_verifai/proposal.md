1. Title  
LemmaGen: LLM-Assisted Lemma Generation for Scalable Theorem Proving  

2. Introduction  

Background  
Formal theorem proving systems such as Coq and Lean provide iron-clad guarantees about program correctness and mathematical theorems via rigorous proof checkers. However, as proof obligations grow in size and complexity, automated tactics often stall, and human experts must manually conjecture and insert intermediate lemmas to guide the search. This “lemma bottleneck” dramatically slows down large-scale formalization efforts in software verification, mathematical libraries, and safety-critical systems.  

At the same time, large language models (LLMs) trained on code, proofs, and mathematical texts have shown surprising fluency in generating valid proof fragments, tactics, and even whole theorems when prompted appropriately. Tools such as APOLLO, LemmaHead, LeanDojo, and PALM demonstrate that integrating LLMs into proof assistants can accelerate proof discovery, but they typically focus on end-to-end proof generation or repair rather than systematically synthesizing lemmas as reusable building blocks.  

Research Objectives  
We propose LemmaGen, a framework that embeds a fine-tuned LLM within an interactive theorem prover to automate lemma conjecturing at each proof state. The core objectives are:  
• Design a prompt-based lemma generation pipeline that transforms the current proof context—goal, local hypotheses, and environment—into high-quality lemma candidates.  
• Develop lightweight syntactic, type-checking, and semantic filters to ensure generated lemmas are well-typed and potentially useful before injecting them into the prover’s search.  
• Create a reinforcement-style retraining loop that records successful lemma usages and updates the LLM to improve future suggestions.  
• Benchmark LemmaGen on curated proof corpora (CoqGym, MathComp, miniF2F) and compare against existing baselines in proof success rate, time-to-first-proof, and lemma utility metrics.  

Significance  
If successful, LemmaGen will (1) drastically reduce the manual effort required to formulate auxiliary lemmas, (2) increase the automation level of interactive theorem provers, and (3) broaden the accessibility of formal methods to non-expert users. By marrying the scalability of probabilistic LLMs with the rigor of formal verification, we aim to foster a new generation of AI-augmented proof assistants.  

3. Methodology  

3.1 System Architecture  
LemmaGen consists of four main modules:  
  a. Context Serializer (CS)  
  b. LEMMA-LLM (LL)  
  c. Lemma Filter & Injector (LFI)  
  d. Reinforcement Update Engine (RUE)  

The workflow is illustrated in Figure 1. At each interactive proof step, CS serializes the proof state $S = (\Gamma, G)$, where $\Gamma$ is the set of local hypotheses and $G$ is the current goal. This textual prompt is fed into LL, which returns a ranked list of candidate lemmas $\{L_1, L_2, \dots, L_k\}$. LFI applies checks and attempts to integrate each lemma into the proof context. When a generated lemma leads to a successful proof branch, RUE records $(S, L_i)$ as a positive example and periodically fine-tunes LL to reinforce such behavior.  

3.2 Context Serialization and Prompting  
Let $\Gamma = \{h_1 : T_1,\dots,h_m : T_m\}$ and $G : T_G$. We define a prompt function  
$$
\mathrm{Prompt}(S)\;=\;\text{“Given hypotheses }h_1:T_1,\ldots,h_m:T_m\text{ and goal }G,\text{ suggest up to }k\text{ lemmas that could help prove }G\text{.”}
$$  
In practice, we canonicalize names, omit trivially irrelevant hypotheses, and truncate large terms.  

3.3 Lemma Generation via LLM  
We fine-tune a base model (e.g., CodeLlama or GPT-3.5) on a dataset of proof states and human-written intermediate lemmas extracted from CoqGym and MathComp. The training objective is maximum likelihood on lemma tokens, augmented with a token-level “helpfulness” reward obtained via RUE (see Sec. 3.5).  

3.4 Lemma Filtering and Integration  
Generated lemma candidates $L_i$ undergo:  
  1. Syntactic well-formedness check via the prover’s parser.  
  2. Type checking: ensure $\vdash L_i : \textsf{Prop}$.  
  3. Non-triviality filter: reject lemmas identical to existing library theorems.  
  4. Local relevance scoring: compute  
     $$\text{Rel}(L_i,S) \;=\; \frac{|\text{fv}(L_i)\cap\text{fv}(G)|}{|\text{fv}(L_i)|}\,, $$
     where $\text{fv}(\cdot)$ is the set of free variables. We require $\text{Rel}(L_i,S)\ge\tau$ (e.g.\ $\tau=0.4$).  

Accepted lemmas are injected into $\Gamma$ and the prover’s internal search heuristics are adjusted to prioritize applying these lemmas. When the automated tactics derive a proof of $G$, we log which lemma(s) were used.  

3.5 Reinforcement-Style Updates  
Every time a generated lemma $L_i$ leads to a successful proof, we record the tuple $(S, L_i, \text{success}=1)$; failed branches yield negative signals. Periodically (e.g.\ every 10K proof steps), we fine-tune the LLM with a loss  
$$
\mathcal{L} \;=\; -\sum_{(S,L,\mathrm{succ})}\bigl[\mathrm{succ}\cdot\log p(L\mid S)
  +(1-\mathrm{succ})\cdot\log(1-p(L\mid S))\bigr].
$$  
This biasing encourages higher probability for lemmas that proved useful.  

3.6 Experimental Design  

Datasets and Benchmarks  
• CoqGym: 10K human-written proofs, split 70/15/15 for train/val/test.  
• MathComp Library: 5K lemmas across algebra and number theory.  
• miniF2F (Lean): to test cross-assistant generalization.  

Baselines  
 1. Native tactics only (no lemma generation).  
 2. Random lemma injection from library.  
 3. Lemmanaid (neuro-symbolic template approach).  
 4. APOLLO end-to-end proof generation.  

Evaluation Metrics  
  • Proof success rate: fraction of goals proved within resource limits.  
  • Time-to-first-proof: wall-clock time to complete each proof.  
  • Lemma utility ratio: $\frac{\#\text{useful lemmas}}{\#\text{generated lemmas}}$.  
  • Search space reduction: measured as decrease in number of tactic applications needed.  

Hardware and Implementation  
We will implement LemmaGen in Coq using SerAPI and integrate with PyTorch for the LLM. Training and fine-tuning will run on 8×A100 GPUs, inference on A10G.  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

Expected Outcomes  
• A working prototype of LemmaGen that automatically conjectures and injects intermediate lemmas into Coq proofs with minimal human supervision.  
• Quantitative improvements over baselines:  
  – ≥30% increase in proof success rate on CoqGym.  
  – ≥40% reduction in average time-to-first-proof.  
  – Lemma utility ratio ≥0.6, showing high precision of LLM suggestions.  
• Open-source release of code, prompts, and fine-tuned LLM weights for community use.  

Broader Impact  
LemmaGen bridges probabilistic AI and formal verification by using LLMs to enhance, rather than supplant, rigorous proof search. This hybrid paradigm can:  
  • Democratize formal methods for software engineers lacking deep proof expertise.  
  • Enable large-scale formalization of mathematical libraries and safety-critical codebases.  
  • Inspire new lines of research on reinforcement-style LLM training in symbolic domains.  

5. Conclusion and Future Work  

We present LemmaGen, a novel framework for LLM-assisted lemma generation in interactive theorem proving. By combining prompt-based generation, lightweight type filters, and reinforcement-style updates, LemmaGen aims to overcome the manual lemma bottleneck and scale formal proofs to complex, real-world domains. Future extensions include:  
  • Cross-assistant generalization to Lean and Isabelle/HOL.  
  • Incorporation of semantic checks via SMT solvers.  
  • Curriculum learning to progressively tackle harder proof domains.  

If successful, LemmaGen will mark a significant step toward AI-augmented proof assistants that balance the flexibility of probabilistic models with the exactness of formal methods.
