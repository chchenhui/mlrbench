# Experimental Plan for Adaptive Code Assistants

## Research Hypothesis

The research aims to test the hypothesis that AI code assistants are significantly more effective when they continuously adapt to individual developer workflows, preferences, and coding styles through a bidirectional adaptation process (human-AI co-adaptation).

## Experimental Setup

### 1. Dataset Preparation

We will use two types of datasets:
1. **Synthetic Developer Profiles**: Create profiles representing different developer styles, preferences, and habits
2. **Code Completion Tasks**: Use the HumanEval dataset from OpenAI to evaluate code completion capabilities

### 2. Methods to Compare

1. **Baseline Methods**:
   - **Static LLM**: A code assistant without adaptation capabilities (e.g., standard pre-trained LLM)
   - **Fine-tuned LLM**: A code assistant fine-tuned on general coding patterns but without personalization
   - **Rule-based Personalization**: A code assistant with manually defined rules for personalization

2. **Proposed Methods**:
   - **Online Learning**: Continuous adaptation using stochastic gradient descent on streaming user data
   - **MAML-based Adaptation**: Model-agnostic meta-learning for quick adaptation to new tasks/contexts
   - **Hybrid Approach**: Combining online learning with MAML for optimal adaptation

### 3. Evaluation Methodology

We will evaluate the methods through simulated coding sessions where:

1. **Simulation Process**:
   - Initialize a developer profile with specific preferences and style
   - Present coding tasks from the HumanEval dataset
   - Simulate interactions between the developer and code assistant
   - Collect responses, feedback, and adaptations

2. **Metrics**:
   - **Code Correctness**: Percentage of code that passes test cases
   - **Development Speed**: Number of iterations needed to complete a task
   - **Developer Satisfaction**: Simulated satisfaction score based on alignment with preferences
   - **Adaptation Speed**: How quickly the model adapts to developer preferences
   - **Personalization Accuracy**: How well the model captures and applies developer preferences

### 4. Experimental Protocol

1. **Training Phase**:
   - Train each model variant with the same base capabilities
   - For adaptive models, simulate initial adaptation sessions

2. **Testing Phase**:
   - Run each model through the same set of coding tasks
   - Track all metrics throughout the sessions
   - Analyze performance trajectory over time (adaptation curve)

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Compare performance across all metrics
   - Analyze statistical significance of differences
   - Evaluate trade-offs (e.g., adaptation speed vs. performance)

### 5. Visualization and Analysis

1. **Visualizations**:
   - Learning curves for each method
   - Comparative performance across metrics
   - Adaptation trajectories over time
   - Preference alignment improvement

2. **Analysis**:
   - Quantitative comparison of methods
   - Qualitative analysis of adaptation patterns
   - Identification of key factors influencing adaptation success

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a simulated environment for developer-AI interactions
2. Implement baseline and proposed methods
3. Develop metrics calculation and tracking mechanisms
4. Design visualization and analysis tools
5. Run experiments, collect data, and analyze results

This experimental design will allow us to test our hypothesis about the effectiveness of adaptive code assistants in a controlled, reproducible manner while providing meaningful insights into the adaptation mechanisms and their impact on developer productivity.
