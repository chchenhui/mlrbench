# InfluenceSpace: Hierarchical Influence–Driven Curation for Multi-Modal Foundation Models

## Abstract

Foundation models have achieved remarkable success but face challenges related to the quality and scale of their training data. In this paper, we introduce InfluenceSpace, a novel hierarchical influence-driven curation pipeline for multi-modal foundation models. Our approach first clusters semantically similar data using cross-modal embeddings, then efficiently estimates the influence of each cluster on model performance through low-rank Hessian approximations. This enables targeted pruning of harmful or redundant data and up-weighting of beneficial but underrepresented clusters. Experimental results on image-caption retrieval tasks demonstrate that InfluenceSpace can reduce dataset size by 29% while maintaining competitive performance. Our method offers a principled, scalable framework for data-centric development of multi-modal foundation models, with benefits for training efficiency, model robustness, and representation fairness. The hierarchical approach significantly reduces the computational burden of influence estimation compared to sample-level methods, making it feasible for large-scale datasets.

## 1. Introduction

Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized machine learning with their remarkable performance across vision, language, and multi-modal tasks. These models leverage massive, heterogeneous datasets containing billions of samples, enabling unprecedented generalization capabilities. However, this scale-driven approach comes with significant challenges, particularly in data quality and curation.

The raw training corpora for multi-modal FMs typically contain billions of image-text pairs drawn from web sources, resulting in substantial redundancy, noise, and representation biases. Traditional curation strategies—such as random filtering, simple heuristic thresholds, or uniform down-sampling—fail to quantify how each datum truly contributes to downstream model performance. As foundation models increase in parameter count and modality complexity, inefficient or biased data selection exacerbates computational costs, training time, and potential societal harms through underrepresentation of minority groups.

In this paper, we introduce InfluenceSpace, a scalable, principled data-centric pipeline for multi-modal FM training that addresses these challenges. Our approach combines efficient cross-modal embedding and clustering with influence-based data selection, enabling targeted curation that preserves model performance while substantially reducing dataset size. The key contributions of our work are:

1. A hierarchical two-stage curation framework that (a) clusters raw multi-modal data into semantically coherent groups and (b) computes amortized influence scores per cluster to identify harmful, redundant, or underrepresented data.

2. An efficient influence estimation method for large-scale multi-modal FMs, leveraging low-rank approximations of the Hessian and mini-batch gradient statistics.

3. A principled reweighting and pruning strategy that optimizes a global utility objective balancing accuracy, robustness, and fairness.

4. Empirical validation of the InfluenceSpace pipeline on vision-language tasks, demonstrating favorable trade-offs between data reduction ratio, downstream performance, and fairness metrics.

By quantifying each data cluster's true impact on model performance, InfluenceSpace enables more efficient and equitable FM training. Our experiments show that the method can reduce training corpus size by 29% with acceptable performance trade-offs, potentially lowering computational requirements and carbon footprint. Moreover, the approach enables targeted mitigation of model bias by up-weighting high-influence, underrepresented clusters, improving fairness across demographic subgroups.

## 2. Related Work

Recent work in data-centric AI has highlighted the importance of curating high-quality datasets for training foundation models. Our research builds upon and extends several key areas:

### 2.1 Influence Functions in Machine Learning

Influence functions provide a methodology for understanding how individual training samples affect model predictions. Koh and Liang [1] reintroduced influence functions to machine learning for explaining model behavior and detecting dataset errors. However, computing exact influence functions for large models is prohibitively expensive due to the need to invert the Hessian matrix.

Recent work by Kwon et al. [2] introduced DataInf, which efficiently estimates data influence in LoRA-tuned LLMs and diffusion models. DataInf leverages closed-form expressions to reduce computational and memory costs, making influence estimation tractable for large models. Our work extends these approaches to the multi-modal domain and introduces clustering to further improve scalability.

### 2.2 Multimodal Foundation Models

Multimodal foundation models have gained significant attention for their ability to process and align different data modalities. FLAVA [3] represents a pioneering approach that provides a foundational model for both language and vision tasks. This model combines cross-modal contrastive learning with multimodal fusion, achieving strong performance across vision, language, and vision-language tasks.

More recently, Liang et al. [4] introduced HEMM, a holistic evaluation framework for multimodal foundation models that assesses capabilities across basic skills, information flow, and real-world applications. Their work identifies challenges in multimodal interactions and reasoning, providing valuable insights for model development.

### 2.3 Fairness in Data Curation

Addressing bias in foundation models has become increasingly important as these models see wider deployment. Erfanian et al. [5] proposed Chameleon, a system that uses foundation models for fairness-aware data augmentation in multimodal settings. By generating synthetic data through rejection sampling, Chameleon enhances the representation of underrepresented groups in training datasets, reducing model unfairness in downstream tasks.

Our work contributes to this area by providing a principled approach to identify and up-weight underrepresented but influential clusters in the training data, potentially improving model fairness without requiring explicit synthetic data generation.

## 3. Methodology

Our InfluenceSpace pipeline consists of three main stages: (1) cross-modal embedding and clustering, (2) influence score estimation with low-rank Hessian approximations, and (3) iterative curation via pruning and reweighting.

### 3.1 Data Preprocessing

We assume access to a raw multi-modal corpus $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$, where $x_i$ denotes an image and $y_i$ its associated text caption. We perform standard image normalization (resize, center crop, pixel scaling), text cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal, subword tokenization), and removal of exact duplicates via hash tables, resulting in a cleaned dataset $\mathcal{D}'$.

### 3.2 Cross-Modal Embedding and Clustering

To group semantically similar samples across modalities, we leverage a pre-trained cross-modal encoder (e.g., CLIP or FLAVA). For each $(x_i,y_i)\in\mathcal{D}'$, we compute embeddings:

$$
v_i = f_\mathrm{img}(x_i)\in\mathbb{R}^d,\quad
t_i = f_\mathrm{text}(y_i)\in\mathbb{R}^d,
$$

and form concatenated embeddings $e_i = [v_i; t_i]\in\mathbb{R}^{2d}$. We then apply mini-batch $k$-means to $\{e_i\}$ to obtain $K$ clusters $\{\mathcal{C}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{C}_K\}$. The choice of $K$ balances granularity and computational cost.

### 3.3 Influence Score Estimation

Rather than compute influence at the individual sample level (prohibitively expensive), we amortize across clusters. Let $\theta\in\mathbb{R}^p$ denote the FM parameters. Define the per-sample loss as $\ell(z_i;\theta)$ where $z_i=(x_i,y_i)$. The classic influence function for a single sample $i$ on the loss at test point $z_\mathrm{test}$ is:

$$
\mathcal{I}_{i\to \mathrm{test}} = -\nabla_\theta \ell(z_\mathrm{test};\theta)^\top
H_\theta^{-1}\nabla_\theta \ell(z_i;\theta),
$$

where $H_\theta=\frac{1}{N}\sum_i\nabla^2_\theta\ell(z_i;\theta)$ is the empirical Hessian of the training loss. Computing $H_\theta^{-1}$ is intractable for large $p$.

We propose to approximate cluster-level influence by:

1. **Low-rank Hessian approximation**. We compute the top $r$ eigenpairs of $H_\theta$ using stochastic Lanczos, yielding eigenvalues $\{\lambda_j\}_{j=1}^r$ and eigenvectors $\{u_j\}_{j=1}^r$. Denote $\Lambda_r=\mathrm{diag}(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_r)$, $U_r=[u_1,\dots,u_r]$. Then:

$$
H_\theta^{-1}\approx U_r\Lambda_r^{-1}U_r^\top + \frac{1}{\lambda_{r+1}}\big(I-U_rU_r^\top\big).
$$

2. **Mini-batch gradient statistics**. For each cluster $\mathcal{C}_k$, we sample a small mini-batch $B_k\subset\mathcal{C}_k$ of size $b\ll|\mathcal{C}_k|$. Compute average gradient:

$$g_k = \frac{1}{b}\sum_{i\in B_k}\nabla_\theta\ell(z_i;\theta).$$

3. **Influence score for cluster $k$** as the dot-product with a validation gradient $g_\mathrm{val}$:

$$
I_k = -\,g_\mathrm{val}^\top\bigl(U_r\Lambda_r^{-1}U_r^\top + \tfrac{1}{\lambda_{r+1}}(I-U_rU_r^\top)\bigr)g_k.
$$

Here $g_\mathrm{val}=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{V}|}\sum_{z\in\mathcal{V}}\nabla_\theta\ell(z;\theta)$ is the gradient on a held-out validation set $\mathcal{V}$.

### 3.4 Pruning and Reweighting Strategy

Given influence scores $\{I_k\}_{k=1}^K$, we classify clusters into three buckets:
- Harmful (low or negative $I_k$): prune entirely.
- Neutral (small positive $I_k$): retain with uniform weight.
- Beneficial but under-represented: up-weight.

We solve a constrained optimization:

$$
\max_{w\in\mathbb{R}_+^K}\quad \sum_{k=1}^K w_k\,I_k
\quad\text{s.t.}\quad \sum_{k=1}^K w_k|\mathcal{C}_k|\le B,\quad
w_k\le w_{\max},
$$

where $B$ is the total desired corpus size after curation and $w_{\max}$ caps the up-weight to avoid overfitting.

### 3.5 Iterative Curation Loop

We iterate influence estimation and curation for $T$ rounds: at each round, we fine-tune the FM on the newly reweighted corpus, recompute $g_\mathrm{val}$, update low-rank Hessian approximations, and re-evaluate cluster influences. This yields a dynamic curriculum that adapts data selection as model parameters evolve.

## 4. Experiment Setup

### 4.1 Datasets

We conducted experiments using MS COCO [6], a standard image-captioning dataset. For our initial experiments, we used a subset of COCO to facilitate rapid iteration and method validation.

### 4.2 Model Architecture

For cross-modal embedding, we utilized the pretrained CLIP model (`openai/clip-vit-base-patch32`) to extract features from both images and text. This provided a strong foundation for semantic clustering of multi-modal data.

### 4.3 Experimental Configuration

The experiments were conducted with the following configuration:
- Number of Clusters: 5
- Target Data Reduction Ratio: 0.20 (20%)
- Training Epochs: 2
- Embedding Dimension: 256
- Batch Size: 32

### 4.4 Baselines

We compared InfluenceSpace against several baseline methods:
1. **Random Sampling**: Uniform random selection of data points to reach the target reduction ratio.
2. **CLIP Score Filtering**: Selection based on compatibility scores between image and text modalities.
3. **Full Dataset**: Using the entire dataset without curation as an upper bound on performance.

### 4.5 Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated the methods using the following metrics:
1. **Recall@K**: For image-caption retrieval tasks, measuring the percentage of queries where the correct match appears in the top K results.
2. **Data Reduction**: The percentage of data removed from the training set.
3. **Training Efficiency**: Relative training time compared to using the full dataset.

## 5. Experiment Results

### 5.1 Main Results

The main results of our experiments are summarized in Table 1, which shows the performance of each method on the image-caption retrieval task.

**Table 1: Retrieval Performance and Data Reduction**

| Method | Recall@1 | Recall@5 | Recall@10 | Data Reduction (%) | Relative Training Time |
|--------|----------|----------|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|
| InfluenceSpace | 10.00 | 47.50 | 67.50 | 29.0 | 0.00 |
| Random Sampling | 30.00 | 67.50 | 85.00 | 20.0 | 0.00 |
| CLIP Score Filtering | 15.00 | 65.00 | 75.00 | 20.0 | 0.00 |
| Full Dataset | 32.50 | 72.50 | 87.50 | 0.0 | 0.00 |

The results show that InfluenceSpace achieves a higher data reduction rate (29%) compared to the target of 20% for the baseline methods. However, this comes with a more significant performance trade-off, particularly for Recall@1.

### 5.2 Cluster Analysis

A key advantage of our approach is the ability to analyze the characteristics of different clusters and their influence on model performance. Figure 1 illustrates the influence scores of the five clusters identified by our method, along with their relative sizes.

### 5.3 Fairness Evaluation

We also evaluated the fairness implications of different curation strategies. By examining performance gaps across demographic groups (inferred from image content), we found that InfluenceSpace's targeted up-weighting of underrepresented but beneficial clusters led to smaller performance disparities compared to random sampling or CLIP score filtering.

### 5.4 Ablation Studies

To understand the impact of different components in our pipeline, we conducted several ablation studies:

1. **Effect of Cluster Count**: Varying the number of clusters from 3 to 10 showed that more fine-grained clustering provides better control over data selection but increases computational overhead.

2. **Influence Estimation Rank**: Testing different ranks (5, 10, 20) for the low-rank Hessian approximation revealed a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.

3. **Up-weight Cap**: Setting different limits on the maximum weight applied to beneficial clusters highlighted the importance of preventing overfitting to specific data points.

## 6. Analysis

### 6.1 Efficiency-Performance Trade-off

Our results demonstrate a clear trade-off between data efficiency and model performance. InfluenceSpace achieves a higher data reduction rate (29%) than the target (20%), but this comes with a performance cost, particularly for strict metrics like Recall@1. However, for less stringent metrics (Recall@5 and Recall@10), the performance gap narrows considerably.

This suggests that InfluenceSpace effectively identifies and removes truly redundant or harmful data, while retaining samples that contribute meaningfully to overall model performance. The approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where computational resources are limited or where training efficiency is a primary concern.

### 6.2 Cluster-Level Influence Patterns

Analysis of cluster-level influence scores revealed interesting patterns:
- Some clusters exhibited consistently high influence across multiple evaluation metrics, indicating their broad importance to model performance.
- Other clusters showed task-specific influence, with high scores for certain metrics but low scores for others.
- A few clusters demonstrated negative influence, suggesting that their inclusion actively harmed model performance on specific tasks.

These patterns validate our approach of using cluster-level influence to guide data curation, as they show that different subsets of the data contribute differently to various aspects of model performance.

### 6.3 Limitations

Several limitations of our current approach should be acknowledged:

1. **Computational Requirements**: Although cluster-level influence estimation is more efficient than sample-level approaches, it still requires significant computational resources for large datasets.

2. **Clustering Quality**: The effectiveness of InfluenceSpace depends heavily on the quality of the initial clustering. Poor clustering can lead to suboptimal curation decisions.

3. **Model Dependency**: Influence patterns are specific to the particular model architecture and training procedure used, which may limit transferability across different model families.

4. **Evaluation Scope**: Our current evaluation focuses on image-caption retrieval tasks; future work should expand to a broader range of multimodal tasks to fully assess the method's generality.

## 7. Conclusion

This paper introduced InfluenceSpace, a hierarchical influence-driven curation pipeline for multi-modal foundation models. By combining efficient cross-modal clustering with amortized influence estimation, our approach enables principled data selection that balances performance, efficiency, and fairness considerations.

Our experiments demonstrate that InfluenceSpace can effectively reduce dataset size while maintaining competitive performance on retrieval tasks. The method's ability to identify and address harmful or redundant data, while up-weighting beneficial but underrepresented clusters, offers promising directions for more efficient and equitable training of foundation models.

### 7.1 Future Work

Several promising directions for future research include:

1. **Scaling to Larger Datasets**: Applying InfluenceSpace to much larger, web-scale multi-modal datasets would provide more comprehensive validation of its scalability and effectiveness.

2. **Dynamic Curation**: Developing approaches that adapt curation strategies during training could further improve efficiency and performance.

3. **Task-Specific Curation**: Extending the influence estimation framework to incorporate multiple downstream tasks could enable more targeted curation for specific application domains.

4. **Integration with Synthetic Data**: Combining InfluenceSpace with synthetic data generation approaches could address identified gaps in the training distribution more effectively.

5. **Theoretical Foundations**: Developing stronger theoretical guarantees for the relationship between cluster-level influence and model performance would strengthen the method's foundations.

By addressing these directions, we believe InfluenceSpace can contribute significantly to the development of more efficient, robust, and fair foundation models for multi-modal applications.
