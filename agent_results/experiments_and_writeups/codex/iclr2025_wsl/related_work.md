**Key Challenges:**

1. **Capturing Weight Space Symmetries**: Effectively modeling and embedding neural network weights require accounting for inherent symmetries, such as permutations and scalings. Designing architectures and learning objectives that respect these symmetries remains a significant challenge.

2. **Scalability to Large Model Zoos**: As model repositories grow, developing methods that can efficiently process and retrieve relevant models from vast collections becomes increasingly difficult. Ensuring scalability without compromising performance is crucial.

3. **Contrastive Learning in High-Dimensional Spaces**: Implementing contrastive learning frameworks in the high-dimensional space of neural network weights poses challenges in defining meaningful positive and negative pairs and ensuring effective training dynamics.

4. **Generalization Across Architectures**: Creating embeddings that generalize across diverse neural network architectures is challenging due to variations in layer types, sizes, and connectivity patterns. Developing universal representations that capture functional similarities is an ongoing research area.

5. **Evaluation Metrics for Model Retrieval**: Establishing robust evaluation metrics to assess the quality of model retrieval systems based on weight embeddings is essential. Metrics should account for both the functional performance of retrieved models and the efficiency of the retrieval process.
