**Key Challenges**:

1. **Contextual Understanding**: Accurately encoding the complex and dynamic proof states, including goals, hypotheses, and relevant libraries, remains a significant challenge for LLMs in theorem proving.

2. **Tactic Generation Accuracy**: Ensuring that the tactics generated by LLMs are both syntactically correct and semantically meaningful is critical, as errors can lead to invalid proofs or inefficient proof searches.

3. **Integration with Proof Assistants**: Seamlessly integrating LLMs with interactive theorem provers like Coq or Lean requires robust interfaces and mechanisms to handle the bidirectional flow of information and feedback.

4. **Data Availability and Quality**: The effectiveness of LLMs in this domain heavily depends on the availability of high-quality, annotated datasets of formal proofs, which are often limited or challenging to curate.

5. **Generalization and Scalability**: Developing models that can generalize across different domains and scale to handle large and complex proofs without significant performance degradation is an ongoing challenge.
