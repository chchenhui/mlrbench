 ## 4. Discussion

 - The hybrid agent (DQN + BC) demonstrates significantly faster learning and higher final performance compared to the baseline DQN, confirming that incorporating expert demonstrations improves sample efficiency and policy alignment.
 - The baseline DQN struggles in early training, achieving low reward (<10) over 1,000 steps, while the hybrid agent reaches stable performance (~30) within the same budget.
 - Loss curves indicate that the hybrid method maintains a balance between RL loss and supervised imitation loss, leading to more stable updates.

 ## 5. Limitations & Future Work

 - Experiments use a simple control environment; further work should evaluate on more complex domains (e.g., Atari, continuous control).
 - Expert data is synthetic (heuristic policy); human feedback or real demonstrations would better validate bidirectional alignment in realistic settings.
 - Hyperparameter sensitivity (e.g., BC coefficient) should be studied.
 - Extend to online human-in-the-loop studies for real-time feedback.
