# Uncertainty-Aware Decoding for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models

## 1. Title and Abstract

**Title:** Uncertainty-Aware Decoding for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for text generation but are prone to producing plausible-sounding yet factually incorrect statements, known as hallucinations. These errors severely limit their reliability, especially in high-stakes applications. This paper introduces Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD), a mechanism integrated into the LLM's generation loop designed to proactively mitigate hallucinations. UAD monitors token-level uncertainty (specifically, predictive entropy) at each decoding step. When uncertainty exceeds a dynamically adjusted threshold, indicating a high risk of hallucination, UAD intervenes by re-ranking token candidates to favor lower-uncertainty options. We evaluated UAD using the `distilgpt2` model on the SQuADv2 dataset. Initial experimental results indicate that the `uad_entropy` configuration, under the tested conditions, did not demonstrate a reduction in hallucination rates or an improvement in generation quality (BLEU, ROUGE) compared to a greedy decoding baseline. Both methods exhibited high hallucination rates. However, the `uad_entropy` method showed a slight advantage in computational speed. These findings highlight the challenges in effectively calibrating uncertainty-based interventions and suggest avenues for future research, including exploring more sophisticated uncertainty metrics, intervention strategies, and adaptive thresholding mechanisms.

## 2. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant human-like text, revolutionizing various applications in natural language processing (NLP) [1, 2]. However, a significant challenge hindering their widespread adoption in critical domains such as healthcare, law, and autonomous systems is their propensity to "hallucinate" â€“ generating text that is fluent and convincing but factually incorrect or nonsensical [3, 4]. These hallucinations can erode trust and lead to detrimental consequences if relied upon without scrutiny.

The root of this problem often lies in the models' inability to recognize their own knowledge boundaries or express uncertainty about their predictions [5]. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) aims to provide a measure of a model's confidence in its outputs. By quantifying and leveraging this uncertainty, we can develop mechanisms to assess the reliability of generated text and determine when human oversight is essential [6].

This paper proposes an "Uncertainty-Aware Decoding" (UAD) mechanism, a novel approach designed to be integrated directly into the LLM's text generation loop. The core idea is to monitor token-level uncertainty signals at each step of the decoding process. When the uncertainty associated with potential next tokens surpasses a dynamically adjusted threshold, suggesting an increased risk of hallucination, the UAD module intervenes. This intervention can take various forms, such as constraining the sampling space or re-ranking candidate tokens.

The primary research objectives of this work are:
1.  To develop and implement a UAD mechanism that utilizes token-level uncertainty metrics (e.g., predictive entropy).
2.  To design intervention strategies that leverage uncertainty signals to guide the generation process towards more factually reliable outputs.
3.  To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed UAD approach in reducing hallucination rates on standard factual benchmarks, while also assessing its impact on overall generation quality and computational overhead.

By proactively identifying and mitigating potential hallucinations *during* generation, rather than relying solely on post-hoc filtering, UAD aims to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs. This research contributes to the broader effort of building safer and more dependable AI systems, particularly for applications where factual accuracy is paramount.

## 3. Related Work

The challenge of hallucinations and the need for uncertainty quantification in LLMs have garnered significant attention in recent research. Several approaches have been proposed to estimate uncertainty and mitigate hallucinations.

Smith et al. (2023) introduced an uncertainty-aware decoding mechanism that monitors token-level uncertainty and intervenes when a threshold is surpassed, aiming to reduce hallucinations [7]. Similarly, Patel and Nguyen (2023) focused on quantifying uncertainty using predictive entropy and variance to identify and mitigate erroneous generations [8]. Chen and Martinez (2023) explored Monte Carlo dropout and ensemble methods for uncertainty estimation, demonstrating a reduction in hallucination rates with uncertainty-aware interventions [9]. Kim and O'Connor (2023) presented decoding strategies incorporating uncertainty metrics to guide token selection and enhance factual accuracy [10].

Beyond decoding-time interventions, some research has focused on training-time modifications. Liu and Thompson (2023) proposed a training framework integrating uncertainty estimation, resulting in models less prone to hallucinations [11]. Evaluating the effectiveness of various UQ methods in LLMs has also been a key research direction. Zhang and Davis (2023) assessed different UQ techniques, providing insights into their utility for identifying and mitigating hallucinations [12]. The importance of UQ in high-stakes applications was highlighted by Wilson and Garcia (2023), who proposed methods to incorporate uncertainty into the generation process for critical tasks [13]. Brown and Wang (2023) also introduced techniques for integrating uncertainty measures into neural text generation, showing a decrease in hallucinated outputs [14]. Anderson and Patel (2023) specifically applied uncertainty-aware decoding to neural machine translation to improve translation quality by addressing hallucinations [16]. A comprehensive overview of uncertainty estimation methods in LLMs and their applications in reducing hallucinations is provided by Taylor and Lee (2023) [15].

Despite these advancements, several key challenges persist in the field, as identified in the literature:
1.  **Computational Overhead**: Uncertainty estimation methods like MC dropout or ensembles can significantly increase computational costs, especially for large models [9, 15].
2.  **Threshold Calibration**: Determining optimal uncertainty thresholds for intervention is difficult; strict thresholds might stifle creativity or fluency, while lenient ones may not effectively prevent hallucinations [7].
3.  **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing the trade-off between hallucination reduction and generation quality requires nuanced metrics beyond standard NLP benchmarks [12].
4.  **Generalization Across Domains**: Uncertainty-aware methods need to generalize across diverse tasks and domains, each with unique characteristics [13].
5.  **Balancing Uncertainty and Creativity**: It is crucial to reduce factual errors without unduly constraining the LLM's beneficial generative capabilities [11].

Our proposed UAD mechanism builds upon these existing ideas, particularly focusing on lightweight, token-level uncertainty monitoring and intervention directly within the decoding loop. We aim to investigate the practicalities of such an approach, specifically using predictive entropy, and to shed light on its effectiveness and limitations.

## 4. Methodology

Our proposed Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD) mechanism is designed to be integrated into the standard autoregressive text generation process of LLMs. It monitors the model's uncertainty at each token generation step and intervenes if the uncertainty exceeds a predefined or dynamically adjusted threshold.

### 4.1 Uncertainty Estimation

At each decoding step $t$, given the previously generated sequence of tokens $y_{<t}$, the LLM produces a probability distribution $P(y_t | y_{<t})$ over the entire vocabulary $V$ for the next token $y_t$. We utilize **predictive entropy** as the primary metric for token-level uncertainty. The entropy $H(P(y_t | y_{<t}))$ is calculated as:

$$
H(P(y_t | y_{<t})) = - \sum_{v \in V} P(v | y_{<t}) \log_2 P(v | y_{<t})
$$

A higher entropy value indicates greater uncertainty in the model's prediction for the next token. While other uncertainty metrics like variance from Monte Carlo (MC) dropout or disagreement in lightweight ensembles were considered as potential extensions, our current experiments focus on predictive entropy due to its computational efficiency.

### 4.2 Dynamic Thresholding

The UAD mechanism employs an uncertainty threshold, $\theta$, to trigger interventions. This threshold can be fixed or dynamically adjusted. In our implementation, we initialize $\theta$ (denoted $\theta_{init}$) and provide a learning rate $\alpha$ (denoted `threshold_alpha`) for potential dynamic adjustment based on a reward signal, though the exact mechanism for reward generation in this preliminary study is simple:

$$
\theta_{k+1} = \theta_k + \alpha \cdot \text{reward}_k
$$

where $k$ indexes intervention steps. For the purpose of the experiments reported in this paper, the update rule for the threshold was based on a fixed alpha and a simple feedback mechanism tied to the intervention process itself rather than explicit external reward signals relating to hallucination. More sophisticated reinforcement learning approaches for threshold tuning are a direction for future work.

### 4.3 Intervention Strategies

When the estimated uncertainty for the set of potential next tokens (e.g., top-k candidates) meets or exceeds the threshold $\theta$, UAD intervenes. The specific intervention strategy implemented and evaluated in this work is **Re-ranking Candidate Tokens**:

*   **Re-ranking Candidate Tokens**: From a set of candidate tokens (e.g., those generated by `top_k` sampling), if the initial top candidate's uncertainty is high, or if the uncertainty profile of the candidate list is generally high, the UAD re-ranks these candidates to prioritize tokens that, while perhaps initially less probable according to the base LLM, exhibit lower associated uncertainty or are deemed more consistent with factual grounding (though external factual evidence retrieval is not part of the current UAD implementation). In the `uad_entropy` method, this involves favoring tokens within the `top_k` set that lead to lower predictive entropy if chosen.

Other potential intervention strategies considered for future work include constraining the sampling-distribution to tokens consistent with retrieved factual evidence or injecting special tokens indicating unreliability.

### 4.4 Algorithmic Loop of UAD

The UAD process at each generation step $t$ can be summarized as:
1.  The LLM generates the probability distribution $P(y_t | y_{<t})$ over the vocabulary.
2.  Identify a set of candidate next tokens (e.g., using `top_k` filtering).
3.  For each candidate token, or for the distribution as a whole, calculate the uncertainty (e.g., predictive entropy).
4.  If the maximum uncertainty among top candidates, or the overall distribution's uncertainty, exceeds $\theta$:
    a.  Apply an intervention strategy (e.g., re-rank candidates to favor those with lower uncertainty scores or those that would lead to a lower uncertainty state).
    b.  Select the next token $y_t$ based on the modified candidate list/distribution.
5.  Else (if uncertainty is below $\theta$):
    a.  Select the next token $y_t$ using the standard decoding strategy (e.g., greedy selection from the original `top_k` list).
6.  Append $y_t$ to the sequence and proceed to step $t+1$.

This integration allows UAD to proactively steer generation away from uncertain paths that are more likely to lead to hallucinations.

## 5. Experiment Setup

### 5.1 Model and Dataset

*   **Model**: We utilized `distilgpt2`, a distilled version of GPT-2, chosen for its balance between performance and computational feasibility for rapid experimentation [17].
*   **Dataset**: Experiments were conducted on `squad_v2` [18]. SQuADv2 contains questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where some questions are unanswerable from the provided context. For this task, we used the question prompts to generate answers. We used a subset of 50 samples from the validation set for our experiments due to computational constraints.
*   **Hardware**: All experiments were run on a system equipped with CUDA-enabled GPUs.
*   **Seed**: A fixed random seed (42) was used for reproducibility.

### 5.2 Decoding Methods Evaluated

We compared our proposed UAD method against a standard baseline decoding strategy:

1.  **Baseline (Greedy Decoding)**:
    *   `decoding_method`: greedy
    *   `temperature`: 1.0
    *   `top_p`: 1.0
    *   `top_k`: 0 (no top-k filtering, equivalent to considering all tokens for greedy choice)
    *   `max_length`: 50 (maximum number of tokens to generate)
    *   `num_beams`: 1

2.  **UAD with Predictive Entropy (uad_entropy)**:
    *   `decoding_method`: uad
    *   `uncertainty_method`: entropy (predictive entropy)
    *   `intervention_strategy`: rerank (re-ranking candidate tokens within the `top_k` set based on uncertainty)
    *   `threshold_init`: 0.5 (initial uncertainty threshold for intervention)
    *   `threshold_alpha`: 0.1 (learning rate for dynamic threshold adjustment)
    *   `temperature`: 1.0
    *   `top_p`: 1.0
    *   `top_k`: 50 (considers the top 50 tokens as candidates at each step)
    *   `max_length`: 50

### 5.3 Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the decoding methods, we used the following metrics:

1.  **Hallucination Rate**: This was determined by a proxy where a generated answer was considered a "hallucination" if it failed to achieve a minimal score on factual consistency metrics or if it was an empty/irrelevant generation in the context SQuADv2 (for this experiment, a high rate indicates poor performance). We used an automated method based on keyword overlap with reference answers; if no overlap, it's counted as a hallucination. A rate of 1 means all 50 samples were considered hallucinations.
2.  **Generation Quality**:
    *   **BLEU**: Measures n-gram precision between generated text and reference text [19].
    *   **ROUGE**: Measures n-gram recall (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2) and longest common subsequence (ROUGE-L) between generated text and reference text [20].
    *   **Perplexity**: Measures how well the probability distribution predicted by the model aligns with the actual sequence of tokens. Lower is better.
3.  **Computational Overhead**: Measured as the average time taken to generate a sequence for a single sample.

## 6. Experiment Results

We present the quantitative results from our experiments comparing the baseline greedy decoding with the `uad_entropy` method.

### 6.1 Performance Metrics

Table 1 summarizes the performance of the two methods across the evaluated metrics.

| Model       |   BLEU |   ROUGE-1 |   ROUGE-2 |   ROUGE-L |   Hallucination Rate |   Perplexity |
|:------------|-------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|---------------------:|-------------:|
| baseline    |    0.0 |  0.006667 |       0.0 |  0.006667 |                  1.0 |     45426.1  |
| uad_entropy |    0.0 |  0.006667 |       0.0 |  0.006667 |                  1.0 |     45426.1  |
*Table 1: Performance metrics for baseline and uad_entropy methods. ROUGE scores are F1-measures. Hallucination Rate of 1.0 indicates all generated samples were considered hallucinations by our proxy.*

As shown in Table 1, both the baseline and `uad_entropy` methods achieved identical scores on BLEU, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, Hallucination Rate, and Perplexity. The BLEU and ROUGE-2 scores were 0, indicating very low overlap with reference answers for the chosen `distilgpt2` model and dataset subset under these generation settings. The Hallucination Rate was 1.0 for both, suggesting that, by our automated proxy, all generated sequences were considered factually incorrect or irrelevant. The perplexity scores were also identical.

### 6.2 Hallucination Rate and Generation Quality

Figures 1-4 visually compare the hallucination rates and generation quality metrics.

![Hallucination Rate Comparison](hallucination_rate_comparison.png)
*Figure 1: Hallucination Rate Comparison. Both methods show a rate of 1.0.*

![BLEU Score Comparison](bleu_comparison.png)
*Figure 2: BLEU Score Comparison. Both methods show a score of 0.0.*

![ROUGE-2 Score Comparison](rouge2_comparison.png)
*Figure 3: ROUGE-2 Score Comparison. Both methods show a score of 0.0.*

![ROUGE-L Score Comparison](rougeL_comparison.png)
*Figure 4: ROUGE-L Score Comparison. Both methods show a score of approximately 0.007.*

These figures corroborate the data in Table 1, illustrating no discernible difference between the `uad_entropy` method and the baseline in terms of hallucination mitigation or text quality metrics under the current experimental setup.

### 6.3 Computational Overhead

In terms of computational speed, the `uad_entropy` method took an average of 0.63 seconds per sample to generate a sequence, while the baseline greedy decoding method took an average of 0.92 seconds per sample. This suggests that the `uad_entropy` method, with its specific configuration (e.g., `top_k=50` and re-ranking within this smaller set), was slightly faster than the baseline greedy approach (which had `top_k=0`, meaning it considered the full vocabulary for its greedy choice at each step, potentially leading to higher overhead in this specific implementation).

### 6.4 Uncertainty Analysis

We analyzed the uncertainty characteristics of the `uad_entropy` method.

![Uncertainty Distribution for uad_entropy](uncertainty_distribution.png)
*Figure 5: Distribution of average predictive entropy values observed during generation with the `uad_entropy` method across samples.*

Figure 5 shows the distribution of average predictive entropy values encountered by the `uad_entropy` method during generation. The uncertainty scores are concentrated around a mean, indicating the typical level of uncertainty the model experienced.

![Uncertainty vs. Hallucination Rate for uad_entropy](uncertainty_vs_hallucination.png)
*Figure 6: Average uncertainty vs. Hallucination Rate for the `uad_entropy` method. The point indicates an average uncertainty value corresponding to a hallucination rate of 1.0.*

Figure 6 plots the aggregated average uncertainty against the aggregated hallucination rate for the `uad_entropy` method. As all samples resulted in a hallucination rate of 1.0 according to our proxy, this plot shows a single point, making it difficult to infer a direct correlation between varying levels of uncertainty and hallucination likelihood from this specific aggregated view in this experiment.

## 7. Analysis

The experimental results indicate that the `uad_entropy` method, in its current configuration with `distilgpt2` on the SQuADv2 subset, did not yield improvements in reducing hallucination rates or enhancing generation quality (BLEU, ROUGE scores) compared to a standard greedy decoding baseline. Both methods performed poorly on the task, with hallucination rates of 1.0 and very low n-gram overlap scores.

The lack of improvement from `uad_entropy` is a critical finding. Several factors might contribute to this outcome:
1.  **Simplicity of Uncertainty Metric**: Predictive entropy, while computationally cheap, might not be a sufficiently nuanced signal to differentiate between reliable and hallucinatory generation paths for `distilgpt2` on this task. The information captured by entropy alone might not always correlate strongly with factual incorrectness.
2.  **Intervention Strategy**: The "rerank" strategy, as implemented, might not be effective enough. Re-ranking within the top-k candidates based solely on minimizing next-step uncertainty might not be powerful enough to escape problematic generation trajectories.
3.  **Threshold Calibration**: The initial threshold (`threshold_init: 0.5`) and the simple dynamic adjustment mechanism (`threshold_alpha: 0.1`) might not have been optimal. An inappropriate threshold could lead to interventions that are too frequent and disruptive (if too low) or too infrequent to make a difference (if too high). The high perplexity values for both models suggest the base model struggled significantly with the task.
4.  **Base Model Capability**: `distilgpt2` is a relatively small model. Its inherent capacity to generate factually accurate and contextually relevant answers for SQuADv2 questions might be limited, making it difficult for any decoding strategy to achieve high quality without significant improvements to the base model or integration with external knowledge. The universally high hallucination rate suggests this.
5.  **Evaluation Proxy for Hallucination**: The automated hallucination detection proxy used (based on keyword overlap) is simplistic and may not accurately capture all nuances of hallucination. However, a rate of 1.0 strongly suggests poor performance.

Interestingly, the `uad_entropy` method exhibited slightly lower computational overhead (0.63s per sample) compared to the baseline (0.92s per sample). This could be attributed to the `top_k=50` setting in `uad_entropy`, which restricts the pool of next-token candidates considered at each step for re-ranking and uncertainty calculation, versus the baseline greedy search potentially considering a larger vocabulary space implicitly (even if `top_k=0` means only the single argmax is taken post-softmax over the full vocabulary, the softmax calculation itself is over V tokens). Further profiling would be needed to confirm the exact cause.

The uncertainty distribution (Figure 5) shows that the UAD method did encounter varying levels of uncertainty. However, the lack of variation in the hallucination outcome (always 1.0) makes it impossible to draw conclusions about the correlation between uncertainty and hallucination from Figure 6 in this specific experiment.

**Limitations of this study include:**
*   **Limited Dataset Subset**: Experiments were run on only 50 samples, which may not be representative of the full dataset performance.
*   **Single Small Model**: Only `distilgpt2` was used. Larger, more capable models might respond differently to UAD.
*   **Simplified Uncertainty and Intervention**: We tested only one uncertainty metric (entropy) and one intervention strategy (rerank).
*   **No Human Evaluation**: Reliance on automated metrics for hallucination and quality might not fully reflect human judgment.
*   **Basic Thresholding**: The dynamic thresholding was rudimentary.

These initial results underscore the complexity of mitigating hallucinations via uncertainty. While the UAD concept is theoretically sound, its practical realization requires careful tuning and potentially more sophisticated components.

## 8. Conclusion

This paper introduced Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD), a mechanism designed to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models by monitoring token-level uncertainty and intervening during the generation process. We implemented and evaluated a version of UAD (`uad_entropy`) using predictive entropy as the uncertainty metric and a token re-ranking intervention strategy on the `distilgpt2` model with the SQuADv2 dataset.

Our initial experiments found that, under the tested conditions, the `uad_entropy` method did not demonstrate an improvement in reducing hallucination rates or enhancing standard text generation quality metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) compared to a greedy decoding baseline. Both methods exhibited high hallucination rates and low-quality scores on this challenging task with a small model. A notable observation was that the `uad_entropy` method was slightly faster computationally than the baseline.

These findings highlight that the naive application of uncertainty-based interventions can be insufficient and that the effectiveness of UAD is likely highly dependent on the choice of uncertainty metric, the sophistication of the intervention strategy, the calibration of the uncertainty threshold, and the capabilities of the base LLM. While the core idea of leveraging uncertainty to improve reliability remains promising, significant further research is needed.

**Future Work**:
Based on these initial findings and limitations, future research directions include:
1.  **Advanced Uncertainty Estimation**: Exploring more sophisticated uncertainty metrics, such as those derived from MC dropout, ensembles, or learned uncertainty estimators that might better correlate with factual inaccuracies.
2.  **Sophisticated Intervention Strategies**: Designing and evaluating other intervention strategies, like knowledge-grounded constraining of the sampling space or explicitly injecting "I don't know" or "uncertain" tokens.
3.  **Adaptive Thresholding**: Developing more robust adaptive thresholding mechanisms, potentially using reinforcement learning with more direct reward signals related to factual accuracy and fluency.
4.  **Integration with Retrieval**: Combining UAD with retrieval-augmented generation to provide factual grounding when high uncertainty is detected.
5.  **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Conducting more extensive evaluations on larger models, diverse datasets, and incorporating human evaluation for a more nuanced understanding of hallucination and generation quality.
6.  **Analysis of Model and Task Dependency**: Investigating how the effectiveness of UAD varies across different model architectures/sizes and task types.

Despite the challenges observed in this initial study, the pursuit of uncertainty-aware generation remains a critical frontier for developing more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.
