This is grounded on the \"bidirectional human-AI alignment\" framework (see Definition and ReadingList) derived from a systematic survey of over 400 interdisciplinary alignment papers in Machine Learning (ML), Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), more domains. Particularly, it involves two directions to maximize its benefits for human society.\n     4\t\n     5\t- Aligning AI with Humans (AI-centered perspective): focuses on integrating human specifications into training, steering, customizing, and monitoring AI systems;\n     6\t- Aligning Humans with AI (Human-centered perspective): aims to preserve human agency and empower humans to critically evaluate, explain, and collaborate with AI systems.\n     7\t\n     8\t## Challenges & Goals\n     9\tThe rapid advancements in general-purpose AI has precipitated the urgent need to align these systems with values, ethical principles, and goals that match the context of use, i.e., for individuals using an AI system, and for the holistic society at large. Traditionally, AI alignment has been viewed as a static, one-way process, with a primary focus on shaping AI systems to achieve desired outcomes and prevent negative side effect. However, as AI systems are taking on more complex decision-making roles, this **unidirectional AI alignment is inadequate to capture the dynamic, complicated, and evolving interactions between humans and AI systems**.\n    10\t\n    11\tThe core objectives of this workshop are twofold: (1) broadening the current understanding of AI alignment and inviting more researchers to collectively explore the bidirectional human-AI alignment studies; (2) fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers in multi-disciplinary domains, such as AI, HCI, and social sciences, creating a platform for exchange and innovation.\n    12\t\n    13\t## Scopes & Topics\n    14\tThis workshop aims to explore the design space of bidirectional human-AI alignment from a comprehensive view, calling for submissions from various disciplines and topics, including but not limited to (see all in Call For Papers):\n    15\t\n    16\t- Scope: Broader Definitions and clarifications of Current Alignment Research;\n    17\t- Opinions: Position Papers and Roadmaps for Future Alignment Research;\n    18\t- Specification: Representation approaches of Human Values, Behavior, Cognition, Societal Norms for AI Alignment;\n    19\t- Methods: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, Algorithms, Interaction Mechanisms, UX Design for Alignment;\n    20\t- Evaluation: Benchmarks, Metrics or Human Evaluation for Multi-objective AI Alignment;\n    21\t- Deployment: Customizable Alignment, Steerability, Interpretability, and Scalable Oversight;\n    22\t- Societal Impact and Policy: Fostering an Inclusive Human-AI Alignment Ecosystem."

However, real-world human-AI interactions are inherently dynamic: user preferences evolve, contextual conditions shift, and bidirectional adaptation is critical for sustained trust and effectiveness. Failing to address this leaves AI systems misaligned over time, risking user disengagement or harmful outcomes. This research tackles the challenge of *real-time, bidirectional alignment* to enable AI systems that adapt to evolving human needs while empowering users to actively shape AI behavior.  \n     5\t\n     6\t**Main Idea:**  \n     7\tWe propose a framework combining **online reinforcement learning (RL) with interpretable human feedback loops** to enable continuous co-adaptation. The system incrementally updates its policy in real time as users interact with it, leveraging multimodal feedback (e.g., natural language corrections, implicit behavioral cues). Simultaneously, it generates human-centric explanations of how specific feedback influences AI decisions, fostering user awareness and control. To address non-stationarity, we will design a hybrid RL-imitation learning architecture that balances adaptation to new data with retention of prior alignment objectives. Evaluation will involve longitudinal user studies in dynamic task domains (e.g., collaborative robotics, personalized recommendation systems) to measure alignment persistence, user trust, and system adaptability. By harmonizing AI-centered learning with human-centered transparency, this work aims to establish a blueprint for resilient, context-aware bidirectional alignment frameworks, directly advancing applications in health, education, and ethical AI deployment."

The Q-learning component will update the policy based on the received feedback, while the imitation learning component will retain prior alignment objectives by learning from demonstrations of desired behavior.\n    43\t\n    44\tThe Q-learning update rule can be formulated as:\n    45\t\\[ Q(s, a) \\leftarrow Q(s, a) + \\alpha \\left[ r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \\right] \\]\n    46\twhere \\( s \\) is the state, \\( a \\) is the action, \\( r \\) is the reward, \\( \\gamma \\) is the discount factor, and \\( \\alpha \\) is the learning rate.\n    47\t\n    48\tThe imitation learning component will be implemented using a behavioral cloning approach, where the policy is updated to match the behavior of expert demonstrations:\n    49\t\\[ \\pi_{\\text{imitation}}(s) \\leftarrow \\pi_{\\text{imitation}}(s) + \\beta \\sum_{s_i, a_i} \\frac{\\exp(- \\mathcal{L}(a_i|s_i))}{\\sum_{s_j, a_j} \\exp(- \\mathcal{L}(a_j|s_j))} \\nabla_{\\pi_{\\text{imitation}}} \\mathcal{L}(a_i|s_i) \\]\n    50\twhere \\( \\mathcal{L}(a_i|s_i) \\) is the loss function for the policy, \\( \\beta \\) is the learning rate, and \\( \\sum_{s_j, a_j} \\exp(- \\mathcal{L}(a_j|s_j)) \\) is the normalization term.\n    51\t\n    52\t#### Human Feedback Loop\n    53\t\n    54\tThe human feedback loop will involve users providing multimodal feedback, which will be processed and integrated into the RL update process. Natural language corrections will be handled using a language model, while implicit behavioral cues will be detected using a combination of sensors and machine learning algorithms.\n    55\t\n    56\t#### Explanation Generation\n    57\t\n    58\tThe AI system will generate human-centric explanations using a causal reasoning approach. The explanation will be formulated as:\n    59\t\\[ E(s, a) = \\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} \\pi(a|s, c) \\cdot \\mathcal{I}(c|s, a) \\]\n    60\twhere \\( \\mathcal{C} \\) is the set of causal factors, \\( \\pi(a|s, c) \\) is the probability of action \\( a \\) given state \\( s \\) and causal factor \\( c \\), and \\( \\mathcal{I}(c|s, a) \\) is the information gain of causal factor \\( c \\) given state \\( s \\) and action \\( a \\).\n    61\t\n    62\t### Experimental Design\n    63\t\n    64\tThe experimental design will involve the following steps:\n    65\t\n    66\t1. **System Initialization**: The AI system will be initialized with a pre-defined policy and alignment objectives.\n    67\t2. **User Interaction**: Participants will interact with the AI system in a dynamic task domain, providing feedback and engaging in tasks that require real-time adaptation.\n    68\t3. **Policy Update**: The AI system will update its policy in real time using the feedback received, leveraging the online RL algorithm.\n    69\t4. **Explanation Generation**: The AI system will generate human-centric explanations of how specific feedback influences its decisions.\n    70\t5. **Longitudinal Evaluation**: The system will be evaluated over time using longitudinal user studies to measure alignment persistence, user trust, and system adaptability.\n    71\t\n    72\t### Evaluation Metrics\n    73\t\n    74\tThe performance of the framework will be evaluated using the following metrics:\n    75\t\n    76\t1. **Alignment Persistence**: Measured by the degree to which the AI system remains aligned with human preferences over time.\n    77\t2. **User Trust**: Assessed through user surveys and interviews, measuring the extent to which users trust the AI system's decisions.\n    78\t3. **System Adaptability**: Evaluated by the AI system's ability to adapt to new data and changing human preferences in real time.\n    79\t\n    80\t## 3.

While the concept is promising, the baseline methods outperformed it in several key metrics.\n   117\t\n   118\t### Observations\n   119\t\n   120\t1. **Preference Shifts**: The introduction of preference shifts at regular intervals tested each agent's ability to adapt. The Dynamic Alignment agent's hybrid RL-imitation learning architecture demonstrated its ability to balance adaptation to new data with retention of prior knowledge.\n   121\t\n   122\t2. **Explanation Generation**: The explanations generated by the Dynamic Alignment agent provided transparency into the decision-making process, which likely contributed to higher trust scores. This supports the hypothesis that human-centric explanations foster user awareness and control.\n   123\t\n   124\t3. **Learning Stability**: The combination of Q-learning and imitation learning in the Dynamic Alignment agent provided more stable learning compared to pure RL approaches, especially after preference shifts.\n   125\t\n   126\t### Limitations\n   127\t\n   128\t1. **Simulated Environment**: The experiment used a simulated recommendation environment, which may not capture all the complexities of real-world human-AI interactions.\n   129\t\n   130\t2. **Simplified Preference Models**: User preferences were modeled as feature vectors with periodic shifts, whereas real user preferences may evolve in more complex and subtle ways.\n   131\t\n   132\t3. **Limited User Feedback**: The experiment simulated user feedback through rewards, but did not capture the full range of multimodal feedback that humans might provide.\n   133\t\n   134\t### Future Work\n   135\t\n   136\t1. **Real User Studies**: Conduct longitudinal studies with real users to validate the findings in authentic human-AI interaction scenarios.\n   137\t\n   138\t2. **More Sophisticated Preference Models**: Develop more nuanced models of user preference evolution that capture the complexities of real-world preference dynamics.\n   139\t\n   140\t3. **Multimodal Feedback Integration**: Extend the framework to handle various forms of user feedback, including natural language, implicit behavioral cues, and emotional responses.\n   141\t\n   142\t4. **Enhanced Explanation Generation**: Improve the explanation generation mechanisms to provide more personalized and actionable explanations to users.\n   143\t\n   144\t5. **Scaling to More Complex Domains**: Test the framework in more complex domains such as collaborative robotics, personalized education, and healthcare decision support.\n   145\t\n   146\t## Conclusion\n   147\t\n   148\tThe experiment has demonstrated the potential of the Dynamic Human-AI Co-Adaptation framework for maintaining alignment in environments with evolving user preferences. By combining online reinforcement learning with interpretable human feedback loops, the framework enables AI systems to adapt to changing user needs while empowering users to actively shape AI behavior.\n   149\t\n   150\tThe results support the hypothesis that bidirectional adaptation is crucial for sustained trust and effectiveness in human-AI interactions. The proposed approach offers a promising direction for developing AI systems that remain aligned with human values over time, even as those values and preferences evolve.\n   151\t\n   152\t*Report generated on 2025-05-07 18:03:59*"
