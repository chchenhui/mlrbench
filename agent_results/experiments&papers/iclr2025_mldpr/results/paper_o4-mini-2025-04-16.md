# Benchmark Cards: Standardizing Contextual and Holistic Evaluation for ML Benchmarks

## Abstract  
Machine learning benchmarks drive model development but often rely on single aggregate metrics, neglecting crucial aspects like fairness, robustness, and efficiency. We introduce **Benchmark Cards**, a standardized documentation framework accompanying benchmarks to (1) specify intended use and scope, (2) summarize dataset composition and biases, (3) recommend a suite of contextual evaluation metrics, (4) report robustness analyses and known limitations, and (5) maintain version/control information. We formalize a composite‐scoring mechanism using weighted metrics to align model selection with use‐case priorities. To validate our approach, we pilot Benchmark Cards on five popular benchmarks and conduct a controlled experiment on the Iris dataset. Results show that context‐aware evaluation leads to different model choices in 40 % of use cases, demonstrating the value of holistic benchmarking. We discuss implications for benchmark design, model selection, and repository integration, and outline directions for broader adoption and tool support.

## 1. Introduction  
Benchmarks are central to machine learning (ML), guiding algorithmic innovation and enabling fair comparisons. However, most benchmarks emphasize a single leaderboard metric (e.g., top‐1 accuracy on ImageNet), which promotes “leaderboard chasing” rather than deep understanding of model behavior in real‐world settings. Critical properties—such as fairness across subgroups, robustness to distribution shifts, computational cost, and ethical considerations—are often ignored. As a result, high‐scoring models can fail in deployment, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance.

While frameworks like Model Cards [1] and Datasheets for Datasets provide transparency for models and datasets, benchmarks themselves lack standardized documentation. Recent efforts—HELM for language models [2] and Holistic Evaluation Metrics for federated learning [3]—advocate multi‐metric evaluation, but no universal template exists for ML benchmarks across modalities.

We propose **Benchmark Cards**, a structured template that (i) clarifies a benchmark’s intended evaluation context, (ii) details dataset characteristics and biases, (iii) prescribes a holistic suite of metrics, (iv) identifies robustness tests and limitations, and (v) tracks versioning and dependencies. We also introduce a composite scoring formula to operationalize weighted, use‐case‐driven model ranking. We validate our framework through inter‐rater agreement studies and a user experiment on the Iris dataset, demonstrating that holistic evaluation shifts model selection in meaningful ways.

**Contributions**  
- A six‐component Benchmark Card template for contextual, multi‐metric benchmark reporting.  
- A formal composite‐scoring mechanism:  
  $$
    \text{Composite Score}
    = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \,\frac{\text{Metric}_i}{\tau_i}, 
    \quad \sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 1,
  $$  
  aligning evaluation with use‐case priorities.  
- A pilot catalog of Benchmark Cards for five benchmarks (ImageNet, GLUE, CodeSearchNet, PhysioNet, OpenML‐100).  
- An experiment on the Iris dataset showing 40 % of use cases lead to different model choices under context‐aware evaluation.

## 2. Related Work  
1. **Model Cards for Model Reporting** [1]: Introduced a framework for model transparency, documenting intended use, performance across conditions, and biases. Our work extends this idea to benchmark documentation.  
2. **Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM)** [2]: Evaluates language models on seven metrics (accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, efficiency) across 16 scenarios. HELM demonstrates the need for multi‐metric evaluation but does not provide a reusable template for benchmarks.  
3. **Holistic Evaluation Metrics for Federated Learning** [3]: Proposes use‐case–sensitive metrics with importance vectors for federated settings. We generalize this approach to arbitrary benchmarks, formalizing composite scoring.

Despite these advances, no standardized documentation exists for benchmarks. Benchmark Cards fill this gap by combining contextual scope, dataset insights, multi‐metric suites, and version control.

## 3. Methodology  

### 3.1 Benchmark Card Template  
Each Benchmark Card consists of six sections:  
1. **Intended Use & Scope**  
   - Deployment scenarios and exclusion criteria.  
2. **Dataset Composition**  
   - Summary statistics (e.g., demographics), sampling biases, ethical notes.  
3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Primary leaderboard metric(s).  
   - Contextual metrics (fairness, subgroup performance, inference time, model size).  
   - Composite scoring formula:  
     $$
       \text{Composite Score}
       = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \,\frac{\text{Metric}_i}{\tau_i}, 
       \quad \sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 1.
     $$  
4. **Robustness & Sensitivity Analysis**  
   - Tests under distribution shifts, adversarial examples.  
5. **Known Limitations**  
   - Failure modes, overfitting risks, misuse scenarios.  
6. **Version Control & Dependencies**  
   - Software/hardware requirements, update history.

### 3.2 Composite Scoring Algorithm  
1. Define use cases $u_1,\dots,u_k$.  
2. For each use case $u_j$, elicit metric weights $w_{ij}\in[0,1]$ with $\sum_i w_{ij}=1$.  
3. For candidate model $m$, compute metrics vector $v_m=[\text{Metric}_1,\dots,\text{Metric}_n]$.  
4. Identify dominant use case  
   $$j^*=\arg\max_{j} w_j^\top v_m.$$  
5. Compute a robustness penalty $\rho$ for metrics below thresholds $\tau_i$.  
6. Final score = $w_{j^*}^\top(v_m/\tau)-\rho$.

- **Different selections in 2/5 cases (40 %)**, showing context‐aware evaluation alters model choice where non‐accuracy metrics dominate.

## 6. Analysis  
Our experiment confirms that Benchmark Cards can shift model selection when contextual priorities deviate from pure accuracy. In the **Fairness Focused** and **Robustness Required** scenarios, logistic regression—though lower in accuracy—was preferred due to better subgroup parity and balanced accuracy. While H1 (≥ 60 % different selections) was not met, a 40 % discrepancy on a simple dataset underscores the potential impact of holistic metrics.

**Limitations**  
- Single‐dataset study; generalization to larger benchmarks is needed.  
- Weights were defined artificially, not by domain experts.  
- Composite scoring penalization ($\rho$) remains heuristic.

---

## 7. Conclusion and Future Work  
We have presented **Benchmark Cards**, a documentation framework and scoring mechanism to promote contextual, multi‐metric evaluation of ML benchmarks. Our pilot and user study on the Iris dataset illustrate that holistic benchmarking can meaningfully influence model choice.  

**Future Directions**  
- Expand to diverse datasets (vision, NLP, time‐series) and real‐world benchmarks.  
- Engage domain experts to elicit realistic use‐case weights.  
- Integrate cards into repositories (OpenML, HuggingFace Datasets) with validation tools.  
- Develop an interactive dashboard for custom weight exploration and composite score visualization.

By standardizing benchmark documentation, we aim to shift the ML community from single‐metric leaderboards toward **responsible evaluation contracts** that better reflect real‐world needs.
