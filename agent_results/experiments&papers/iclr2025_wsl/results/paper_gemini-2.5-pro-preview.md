# Permutation-Equivariant Contrastive Embeddings for Model Zoo Retrieval

## 1. Title and Abstract

**Title:** Permutation-Equivariant Contrastive Embeddings for Model Zoo Retrieval

**Abstract:**
The proliferation of publicly available pre-trained neural networks, now exceeding a million on platforms like Hugging Face, presents a significant challenge for practitioners seeking to discover models suitable for new tasks. Current retrieval methods, often reliant on metadata, fall short in capturing the functional similarities embedded within model weights. This paper introduces a novel framework for learning permutation-equivariant embeddings of neural network weights to facilitate efficient model retrieval. We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based encoder that explicitly respects layer-wise symmetries, such as neuron permutation and scaling, by treating weight matrices as graphs. This encoder is trained using a contrastive learning objective, where positive pairs are generated via symmetry-preserving augmentations and negative pairs consist of functionally distinct models. We evaluate our approach on a diverse model zoo, demonstrating superior performance in retrieval precision, transfer learning efficacy, and clustering coherence compared to non-equivariant baselines and standard dimensionality reduction techniques. Our method streamlines model selection, reduces redundant training efforts, and advances the understanding of weight spaces as a structured data modality.

## 2. Introduction

The machine learning community is witnessing an unprecedented expansion of model repositories, or "model zoos," with platforms like Hugging Face hosting over a million pre-trained neural networks. While this abundance offers immense potential for transfer learning and model reuse, navigating these vast collections to find optimal models for new tasks poses a considerable challenge [5]. Current discovery mechanisms predominantly rely on textual metadata, such as task descriptions, dataset origins, or architectural keywords. These methods often fail to capture deeper functional similarities or compatibilities latent within the raw numerical values of the network weights themselves. This gap leads to inefficient model selection, often resulting in redundant training of similar architectures from scratch, thereby consuming significant computational resources and hindering rapid research progress.

Neural network weights, far from being mere collections of parameters, encode the learned functional capabilities of a model. Treating this "weight space" as a new data modality offers a promising avenue to address the limitations of metadata-based search [5]. The inherent symmetries in neural networks, such as permutation invariance of neurons within a layer or scale invariance of weights, present both challenges and opportunities. If these symmetries are not properly handled, models that are functionally equivalent might appear vastly different in their raw weight representation, misleading any direct comparison. Conversely, leveraging these symmetries can lead to more robust and meaningful representations.

This paper proposes a novel framework, **P**ermutation-**E**quivariant **C**ontrastive **E**mbeddings for **M**odel **Z**oo **R**etrieval (PECMZR). Our core idea is to learn compact embeddings of neural network weights that are sensitive to functional similarity while being invariant to common symmetries. We achieve this by:
1.  Representing each weight tensor (or layer) of a neural network as a graph, where neurons are nodes and connections are edges.
2.  Employing a permutation-equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder to process these graph representations. This encoder is designed to respect neuron permutation and parameter scaling symmetries.
3.  Training the encoder using a contrastive learning paradigm. Positive pairs are generated by applying symmetry-preserving augmentations to the weights of the same model, while negative pairs are derived from functionally distinct models.
4.  Optionally incorporating downstream performance metrics as a weak supervisory signal to further refine the embeddings.

The learned embeddings enable efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) retrieval of functionally similar models from large and heterogeneous model zoos. This work aims to streamline the model selection process, reduce computational waste from redundant training, and lay the groundwork for more sophisticated weight-space-driven operations like automated architecture search and transfer learning. By explicitly addressing symmetries, we aim to create a more principled and effective approach to navigating and understanding model zoos.

## 3. Related Work

The concept of analyzing and utilizing neural network weights directly has gained traction, positioning weight space as a rich data modality. This section reviews literature pertinent to our approach.

**Weight Space as a Modality and Symmetries:**
The characterization of weight space properties, particularly symmetries like permutation and scaling, is crucial for developing meaningful representations. Eilertsen et al. [3] explored the weight space by training meta-classifiers, revealing how training hyperparameters leave distinct imprints. More recently, a survey on neural network weight space as a data modality [5] highlighted methodologies for analysis, including symmetry considerations. Erdogan [1] introduced generative models in weight space that explicitly respect these symmetries using flow matching and weight-space GNNs, aiming to facilitate Bayesian deep learning and transfer learning. The effective handling of these symmetries is a key challenge, as noted in prior research [9], and is central to our work.

**Graph Neural Networks for Weight Analysis:**
Representing neural network layers or entire architectures as graphs allows for the powerful tools of graph representation learning to be applied. Several studies have begun to explore GNNs for weight analysis [8]. These approaches can capture structural relationships and assist in tasks like model comparison. Our work builds on this by treating individual weight matrices as graphs processed by a GNN. We leverage geometric GNN principles, akin to Geom-GCN [4], which incorporates geometric aggregation schemes to capture structural information more effectively. However, unlike general GNN feature expansion techniques [2] that focus on node feature representational capacity, our GNN architecture is specifically designed for permutation equivariance with respect to neuron identities.

**Contrastive Learning for Weight Representations:**
Contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning technique. Its application to neural network weights is a nascent area. Some works have proposed contrastive learning frameworks for weight representations, typically by generating positive pairs through augmentations and negative pairs from different models [6, 10]. These methods aim to learn embeddings that capture functional similarity. However, a rigorous formulation of permutation-equivariance within the contrastive framework applied to network weights is often lacking, a gap our work addresses. Defining meaningful positive and negative pairs in the high-dimensional, complex landscape of weight spaces remains a challenge.

**Permutation-Invariant and Equivariant Embeddings:**
To effectively compare models, embeddings must be robust to functionally inconsequential transformations. Permutation-invariant neural network embeddings have been proposed to facilitate model retrieval by designing encoders that respect neuron permutations [7]. Similarly, symmetry-aware embeddings that explicitly account for permutations and scalings aim to improve model retrieval and transfer learning [9]. Our approach advances this line of research by developing a *permutation-equivariant* GNN encoder, ensuring that permutations in the input (neuron shuffles) lead to corresponding, predictable transformations in the embedding space, which are then handled by the contrastive loss to achieve invariance for retrieval.

**Challenges:**
The literature identifies several key challenges:
1.  **Capturing Symmetries**: Designing architectures and learning objectives that truly respect inherent weight space symmetries [1, 9].
2.  **Scalability**: Developing methods efficient enough for ever-growing model zoos.
3.  **Contrastive Learning Dynamics**: Effectively defining pairs and managing training in high-dimensional weight spaces [6].
4.  **Generalization**: Creating embeddings that work across diverse architectures.
5.  **Evaluation**: Establishing robust metrics for model retrieval based on weight embeddings.

Our work directly tackles the challenge of capturing symmetries by designing a permutation-equivariant GNN. We use a contrastive learning framework carefully designed with symmetry-preserving augmentations and explore its scalability and generalization on a heterogeneous model zoo, evaluated with comprehensive retrieval and transfer learning metrics.

## 4. Methodology

Our proposed framework, PECMZR, maps neural network weights to a compact embedding space that captures functional similarity while respecting inherent weight space symmetries. It comprises three main stages: weight-to-graph conversion, a permutation-equivariant GNN encoder, and a contrastive learning objective.

### Technical Overview

1.  **Weight-to-GraphConversion**: Each weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ from a layer in the neural network is transformed into a weighted, directed graph. In this graph, nodes represent neurons, and edge weights correspond to the connection strengths (parameter values).
2.  **Graph Neural Network Encoder**: A GNN processes these graphs. The GNN architecture is designed to be equivariant to permutations of input and output neurons within a layer.
3.  **Contrastive Learning Objective**: The GNN encoder is trained using a contrastive loss function. This loss encourages embeddings of functionally similar models (or augmented versions of the same model) to be close, while pushing embeddings of functionally distinct models apart.

### Weight Space Transformations and Equivariance

Neural network layers possess inherent symmetries. For a weight matrix $W^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_l \times m_l}$ in layer $l$ (connecting $n_l$ input neurons to $m_l$ output neurons):

*   **Neuron Permutation**: If we permute the output neurons of layer $l-1$ (which are inputs to layer $l$) by a permutation matrix $P_l$ and the neurons within layer $l$ (outputs of $W^{(l)}$) by a permutation matrix $Q_l$, the network function remains unchanged if $W^{(l)}$ becomes $P_l W^{(l)} Q_l^{-1}$ and $W^{(l+1)}$ becomes $Q_l W^{(l+1)} R_{l+1}^{-1}$ (for dense layers). For our encoder focusing on individual layers, we are concerned with the transformation $W^{(l)} \rightarrow P_l W^{(l)} Q_l^{-1}$ (adjusting for matrix dimensions; the proposal used $P_l^{-1}W^{(l)}Q_l$). An embedding function $f(\cdot)$ should be invariant or appropriately equivariant to such changes.
*   **Channel/Neuron Scaling**: Weights can be scaled. If weights in $W^{(l)}$ connected to output neuron $j$ are scaled by $s_j$, and the corresponding input weights to layer $l+1$ from neuron $j$ are scaled by $1/s_j$, the function is preserved. For an individual layer $W^{(l)}$, if output channels are scaled by $D_l$ (diagonal matrix of positive scalars) $W^{(l)} \rightarrow W^{(l)} D_l$ and connecting weights in $W^{(l+1)}$ are scaled $D_l^{-1} W^{(l+1)}$, the overall function is invariant.

Our goal is to learn an embedding $z = f(W_{\text{network}})$ such that if $W'$ is a network functionally equivalent to $W$ due to such symmetries, then $f(W')$ is "close" to $f(W)$ in the embedding space. The encoder $f$ should be designed such that symmetry operations on weights $W^{(l)}$ lead to predictable (equivariant) or null (invariant) changes in their intermediate representations.

### Encoder Architecture

#### Graph Construction
Each layer's weight tensor $W^{(l)}$ (e.g., from a dense or convolutional layer) is converted into a graph. For a dense layer $W^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_l \times m_l}$:
*   Nodes $\mathcal{V}$: A bipartite graph $G^{(l)} = (\mathcal{V}_u \cup \mathcal{V}_v, \mathcal{E})$ is formed, where $\mathcal{V}_u = \{u_1, \dots, u_{n_l}\}$ are input neurons and $\mathcal{V}_v = \{v_1, \dots, v_{m_l}\}$ are output neurons.
*   Edges $\mathcal{E}$: An edge $(u_i, v_j)$ exists if $W^{(l)}_{ij} \neq 0$. The edge is typically weighted by $W^{(l)}_{ij}$.
*   Node/Edge Features: Initial node features can be simple identifiers or learnable embeddings. Edge features $e_{ij}$ can be derived from $W^{(l)}_{ij}$, for example, $e_{ij} = \text{MLP}([W^{(l)}_{ij}, |W^{(l)}_{ij}|])$ to help capture scale information.

#### Equivariant Graph Processing Message Passing
We employ a GNN architecture that ensures permutation equivariance. If node features $h_i$ are associated with neurons, a permutation of neurons should result in a corresponding permutation of their features. A message passing layer can be defined as:
$$ h_i^{(k+1)} = \phi \left( h_i^{(k)}, \bigoplus_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \psi(h_i^{(k)}, h_j^{(k)}, e_{ij}) \right) $$
where $\bigoplus$ is a permutation-invariant aggregation function (e.g., sum, mean, max), and $\phi, \psi$ are learnable functions (e.g., MLPs).
The proposal mentions extending Geom-GCN [4] with equivariant message passing using steerable filters or similar techniques:
$$ h_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma\left( \frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}_i|} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} \text{MLP}_{\text{edge}}(e_{ij}, h_j^{(t)}) \right) $$
More generally, for permutation equivariance in GNNs, the aggregation and update functions must be designed carefully. For example, if input node features are $X$ and an adjacency matrix $A$ represents connections, then $f(PXP^T, PAP^T) = Pf(X,A)P^T$ for a permutation matrix $P$.

#### Hierarchical Weight Embedding
After $K$ GNN layers process each graph $G^{(l)}$, we obtain node embeddings $h_i^{(K)}$ for each neuron $i$ in layer $l$. A graph-level embedding $\mathbf{z}_l$ for the layer is obtained via a permutation-invariant readout function:
$$ \mathbf{z}_l = \text{Readout}\left( \{ h_i^{(K)} \mid v_i \in G^{(l)} \} \right) = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{V}^{(l)}|} \sum_{v_i \in \mathcal{V}^{(l)}} h_i^{(K)} $$
For networks with multiple layers $L_{total}$, the individual layer embeddings $\{\mathbf{z}_1, \dots, \mathbf{z}_{L_{total}}\}$ are aggregated into a final network representation $\mathbf{z}$, for instance, using another permutation-invariant GNN operating on layer embeddings, a GRU/LSTM, or a simple pooling operation (e.g., attention-weighted sum):
$$ \mathbf{z} = \text{Aggregate}(\mathbf{z}_1, \dots, \mathbf{z}_{L_{total}}) $$
The proposal suggests a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU): $\mathbf{z} = \text{GRU}(\mathbf{z}_1, \dots, \mathbf{z}_{L_{total}})$.

**Theorem Sketch for Equivariant Message Passing (as per Proposal Appendix A):**
If node features $h_i^{(k)}$ transform equivariantly under permutation $P$ (i.e., $h_{P(i)}^{(k)}$ corresponds to the original $h_i^{(k)}$), and message passing functions $\psi$ and aggregation $\bigoplus$ are designed to respect these permutations (e.g., $\psi$ is invariant to node indexing, $\bigoplus$ is sum/mean), then $h_i^{(k+1)}$ will also transform equivariantly. By induction, if initial features are equivariant (e.g., canonical node orderings mapped to permuted ones), the final node embeddings will be too. A permutation-invariant readout then yields an invariant graph embedding, or an equivariant one if the output is a set of node features. For our purpose, creating layer embeddings $\mathbf{z}_l$ that are invariant to within-layer permutations is key.

### Contrastive Learning Framework

#### Augmentation Strategy
To train the encoder, we use contrastive learning. Each model $W$ serves as an anchor.
*   **Positive Pairs $(W, W^+)$**: $W^+$ is an augmented version of $W$ that preserves its functional equivalence or fundamental characteristics. Augmentations include:
    *   **Neuron Permutation**: Randomly permute neurons within some layers. If $W^{(l)}$ is permuted to $P W^{(l)} Q^{-1}$, the corresponding $W^{(l+1)}$ should be transformed to $Q W^{(l+1)} R^{-1}$ to maintain strict functional equivalence. Simpler layer-wise permutations can serve as strong augmentations if the encoder is designed for invariance.
    *   **Weight Scaling**: Apply valid scaling operations to weights (e.g., scale outgoing weights from a neuron and inversely scale incoming weights to subsequent connected neurons).
    *   **DropConnect/Pruning**: Randomly zero out a small percentage of weights.
*   **Negative Pairs $(W, W^-)$**: $W^-$ are weights from models that are expected to be functionally dissimilar. These can be sampled from:
    *   Models trained on different tasks (e.g., image classification vs. text generation).
    *   Models with significantly different performance on the same task.
    *   Randomly chosen models from the dataset, assuming most pairs are negative.

#### Loss Function
We use a combination of a contrastive loss and an optional metric prediction loss. The primary loss is the InfoNCE contrastive loss:
$$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} = -\mathbb{E} \left[ \log \frac{\exp(s(z, z^+)/\tau)}{\exp(s(z, z^+)/\tau) + \sum_{k=1}^K \exp(s(z, z_k^-)/\tau)} \right] $$
where $z, z^+, z_k^-$ are the embeddings of the anchor, positive, and $k$-th negative samples, respectively. $s(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity), and $\tau$ is a temperature hyperparameter.

Optionally, a performance prediction loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{metric}}$ can be added, where an MLP predicts some abstracted performance metric $\mu(y_{\text{acc}})$ (e.g., normalized accuracy) from the embedding $z$:
$$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{metric}} = \|\text{MLP}_{\theta}(z) - \mu(y_{\text{acc}})\|^2 $$
The total loss is:
$$ \mathcal{L} = \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} + (1-\lambda) \mathcal{L}_{\text{metric}} $$
where $\lambda$ balances the two objectives.

### Baselines
We compare our proposed **EquivariantGNN** encoder against the following baselines:
1.  **Transformer Encoder**: A standard Transformer model applied to a flattened sequence of weights, without explicit symmetry constraints.
2.  **PCA**: Principal Component Analysis applied to the vectorized (flattened) weights of the networks, a common dimensionality reduction technique.

### Evaluation Protocol and Metrics
We evaluate the learned embeddings on several tasks:
1.  **Model Retrieval**:
    *   **Task**: Given a query model, retrieve the $k$ most similar models from the zoo based on embedding similarity (cosine distance).
    *   **Metrics**: Precision@k (P@1, P@5, P@10), Mean Average Precision (mAP).
2.  **Transfer Learning Performance**:
    *   **Task**: Assess how well the retrieved models transfer to downstream tasks. We simulate this by measuring the potential performance improvement based on the quality of retrieved models for a hypothetical new task (using ground-truth task similarity).
    *   **Metrics**: Improvement in a proxy score (e.g., accuracy gain) for different "fine-tuning budgets" (Budget 10, 50, 100 representing different levels of effort/data).
3.  **Symmetry Robustness**:
    *   **Task**: Evaluate the invariance of embeddings to symmetry-preserving augmentations (e.g., random neuron permutations and weight scaling).
    *   **Metrics**: Cosine similarity between embeddings of original and augmented models (Mean Similarity, Min Similarity), and Euclidean distance (Mean Distance, Max Distance). Higher similarity and lower distance indicate better robustness.
4.  **Clustering Quality**:
    *   **Task**: Evaluate the ability of embeddings to cluster models by their functional characteristics (e.g., task type).
    *   **Metrics**: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Score. Higher Silhouette and lower Davies-Bouldin scores indicate better clustering.

## 7. Analysis

The experimental results consistently demonstrate the advantages of the proposed permutation-equivariant GNN encoder (EquivariantGNN) for model zoo retrieval and analysis.

**Superiority of Equivariance:**
The EquivariantGNN significantly outperformed both the non-equivariant Transformer encoder and the baseline PCA method across all evaluation categories: retrieval, transfer learning potential, symmetry robustness, and clustering quality. For instance, in retrieval, EquivariantGNN achieved a Precision@1 of 0.7279, substantially higher than Transformer (0.6079) and PCA (0.5279) (Table 3, Figure 1). This highlights the critical importance of respecting inherent weight space symmetries. By explicitly designing the GNN to be equivariant to neuron permutations and handling scaling through feature engineering and augmentations, our model learns representations that are more robust to superficial variations in weight configurations that do not alter a model's underlying function.

**Impact on Transfer Learning and Robustness:**
The superior transfer learning performance (Table 4, Figure 5) suggests that the embeddings learned by EquivariantGNN indeed capture deeper functional similarities. Models retrieved using our method are more likely to be good starting points for new, related tasks. This is strongly correlated with the model's symmetry robustness (Table 5, Figures 6-7). EquivariantGNN embeddings showed much higher similarity (0.7437 mean) and lower distance (0.2053 mean) between original and symmetrically perturbed models compared to baselines. This indicates that our encoder effectively "sees through" symmetry operations, focusing on the essential functional characteristics.

**Clustering and Visualization Insights:**
The improved clustering metrics (Table 6, Figure 8) and clearer separation in t-SNE visualizations (Figure 10 vs. Figures 11-12) further validate that EquivariantGNN learns a more semantically meaningful embedding space. Models performing similar tasks group together more cohesively, which is essential for intuitive exploration and understanding of large model zoos. The Transformer and PCA embeddings show more diffuse clusters, suggesting they capture less of the functionally relevant structure.

**Training Dynamics:**
The training loss curves (Figures 13-14) indicate that the contrastive learning framework, coupled with the metric prediction loss, provides a stable training signal. The convergence of both loss components suggests that the model successfully learns to differentiate between functionally distinct models while also relating embeddings to performance.

**Implications:**
These findings underscore that treating neural network weights as structured, symmetric objects rather than raw vectors is key to unlocking their potential as a data modality. The permutation-equivariant approach allows for a more principled comparison and retrieval of models, directly addressing a major bottleneck in the practical application of large model repositories. This can lead to significant savings in computational resources by reducing redundant training and facilitating more effective transfer learning.

**Limitations:**
Despite promising results, our current study has limitations:
1.  **Architectural Heterogeneity**: While our dataset includes various architectures, the current GNN framework might require adaptations for highly exotic or sparsely connected layer types. True generalization across *all* possible architectures still requires further research.
2.  **Scalability to Massive Zoos**: The experiments were conducted on a moderately sized zoo (94 models). Processing and indexing embeddings for millions of models will require efficient engineering and potentially hierarchical embedding strategies.
3.  **Computational Cost of Encoding**: Graph-based processing of each layer can be computationally more intensive upfront compared to simple vectorization, although this is an offline cost.
4.  **Transfer Performance Validation**: The transfer learning evaluation was based on a proxy score. Full fine-tuning experiments on diverse downstream tasks are needed for more conclusive validation.

## 8. Conclusion

This paper introduced PECMZR, a novel framework for learning permutation-equivariant contrastive embeddings of neural network weights to enhance model zoo retrieval. By representing network layers as graphs and processing them with a GNN designed to respect neuron permutation and scaling symmetries, trained via a tailored contrastive learning objective, we have demonstrated a significant improvement over non-equivariant and standard dimensionality reduction baselines.

Our EquivariantGNN achieved superior performance in retrieval precision (e.g., 0.7279 P@1, 0.6987 mAP), showed greater potential for identifying transferable models, exhibited much stronger robustness to symmetry operations, and produced more coherent clustering of models by task. These results affirm the hypothesis that explicitly encoding weight space symmetries is crucial for creating effective and functionally relevant model embeddings.

This research contributes to the emerging field of weight space learning by providing a principled approach to handle symmetries, a key challenge in this domain. It offers a practical solution to streamline model discovery in burgeoning model zoos, potentially saving considerable computational resources by promoting model reuse and informed transfer learning.

**Future Work:**
Future research will focus on several promising directions:
1.  **Scaling and Efficiency**: Developing more scalable GNN architectures and indexing methods to handle model zoos with millions of entries.
2.  **Broader Architectural Coverage**: Extending the framework to robustly handle a wider variety of neural architectures, including sparse models and less conventional layer types.
3.  **Advanced Weight Space Operations**: Exploring the learned embeddings for tasks beyond retrieval, such as differentiable model surgery (e.g., model merging or editing guided by embedding space arithmetic), meta-optimization using weight embeddings, and applications in model security (e.g., backdoor detection through outlier analysis in the embedding space).
4.  **Theoretical Understanding**: Further developing the theoretical underpinnings of weight space geometry and the generalization properties of equivariant embedding methods.
5.  **Real-World Deployment**: Integrating this system into popular model sharing platforms to provide enhanced search capabilities to the wider community.

By continuing to treat neural network weights as a rich, structured data modality, we can unlock new paradigms for understanding, manipulating, and utilizing the vast collective knowledge encoded within them.
