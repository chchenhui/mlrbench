# **Dynamic Sparse Retrieval-Augmented Sub-Quadratic Models for Efficient Long Context Adaptation**

## **Abstract**

Foundation models exhibit remarkable capabilities but struggle with the trade-off between processing long contextual information and maintaining inference efficiency quadratically scaling attention mechanisms. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to improve relevance by incorporating external knowledge, conventional RAG methods often append retrieved data to inputs, thereby exacerbating computational costs. This paper introduces Dynamic Sparse Retrieval-Augmented Sub-Quadratic Models (DSRSQ), a novel architecture designed for efficient long-context adaptation. DSRSQ integrates three key components: (1) a Dynamic Sparse Retriever (DSR) trained via reinforcement learning to selectively fetch the most relevant context tokens; (2) a Sub-Quadratic Sparse Attention (SQA) mechanism that processes only these retrieved tokens; and (3) a Rotating Compressive KV Cache (RCKV) that manages historical context within a fixed memory budget using low-rank projections. These components are co-optimized end-to-end using a hybrid loss function balancing task accuracy and computational costs. Experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that DSRSQ significantly improves inference efficiency—achieving up to 57% memory reduction and 49% higher throughput compared to standard Transformers—while maintaining competitive task performance (e.g., 0.8478 F1 score). The proposed approach enables foundation models to dynamically adapt to streaming data with sub-quadratic compute and near-constant memory, paving the way for scalable and efficient long-context understanding.

## **1. Introduction**

Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks. However, a significant challenge remains in their ability to process long contextual information while maintaining inference efficiency. Traditional transformer-based models employ attention mechanisms with quadratic complexity concerning sequence length, rendering them computationally expensive and memory-intensive for long-context applications such as real-time news analysis, legal document processing, or comprehensive scientific literature review [1, 2]. This limitation is particularly acute in scenarios requiring real-time adaptation to evolving contexts.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising technique to enhance foundation models by incorporating relevant external knowledge, thereby improving factuality and reducing hallucinations [8]. However, standard RAG implementations often append retrieved documents directly to the model's input. While this improves relevance, it substantially inflates the effective context window, further exacerbating the quadratic complexity problem and the associated computational and memory overhead. Xu et al. (2023) [8] highlight that while RAG improves performance, it significantly increases processing requirements.

Recent research has explored avenues to mitigate these issues. For instance, AttentionRAG [1] and Grouped Cross Attention (GCA) [2] investigate more efficient integration of retrieved information. Concurrently, techniques like RazorAttention [3] and PyramidKV [5] focus on compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache to reduce memory footprint during inference. However, these approaches often address retrieval efficiency or memory constraints in isolation, lacking a unified framework for end-to-end optimization of both aspects.

This paper proposes **Dynamic Sparse Retrieval-Augmented Sub-Quadratic Models (DSRSQ)**, a novel sub-quadratic architecture that synergistically integrates dynamic sparse retrieval with compressive KV caching. Our research objectives are to:
1.  Design a Dynamic Sparse Retriever (DSR) module, trained using reinforcement learning, to selectively fetch only the most pertinent context tokens relevant to a given query, thereby minimizing redundant prefill operations.
2.  Develop a Sub-Quadratic Sparse Attention (SQA) mechanism that restricts its computation to only the retrieved tokens, thus reducing computational complexity from quadratic to sub-quadratic.
3.  Implement a Rotating Compressive KV Cache (RCKV) that compresses historical context into fixed-size latent states via low-rank projections, preventing unbounded memory growth during the processing of extended sequences.
4.  Formulate an end-to-end training framework with a hybrid loss function that co-optimizes the retriever and attention mechanisms, balancing task accuracy with computational and retrieval efficiency.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to overcome fundamental limitations in processing long contextual information. By providing a unified solution that addresses both computational complexity and memory constraints, DSRSQ aims to enable models to handle extensive contexts efficiently without substantial performance degradation. This capability is crucial for applications involving streaming data, such as real-time news summarization or continuous dialogue systems, allowing for constant memory usage and sub-quadratic compute requirements, thereby improving throughput for long-context tasks.

## **2. Related Work**

The challenge of enabling foundation models to efficiently process long contexts has spurred significant research. Our work builds upon several interconnected areas: efficient attention mechanisms, KV cache compression, and advanced retrieval augmentation strategies.

**Efficient Attention and Long Context Modeling:**
Traditional Transformer models [11] suffer from $O(N^2)$ complexity due to their self-attention mechanism, where $N$ is the sequence length. Many "X-former" variants have proposed to reduce this, such as sparse attention, low-rank approximations, or recurrent mechanisms. The emergence of sub-quadratic models, sometimes with constant Key-Value (KV) states, offers new possibilities for information retention and adaptation without the growing KV cache of standard Transformers. Hu et al. (2024) [2] proposed Grouped Cross Attention (GCA), which generalizes to extremely long contexts by retrieving relevant past chunks, maintaining a constant attention window. Liao and Vargas (2024) [9] introduced Shared Attention (SA), where attention weights are shared across layers, reducing computation by leveraging isotropic tendencies in attention distributions.

**KV Cache Management and Compression:**
The KV cache, storing keys and values for previously processed tokens, becomes a major memory bottleneck for long sequences during inference. Several recent works focus on compressing this cache. Tang et al. (2024) [3] introduced RazorAttention, a training-free method that keeps a full cache for crucial retrieval heads and discards remote tokens in others. Cai et al. (2024) [5] proposed PyramidKV, which dynamically adjusts KV cache size across layers based on an observed pyramidal information funneling pattern. Rehg (2024) [6] presented KV-Compress, allowing variable compression rates per attention head by evicting contiguous KV blocks. SqueezeAttention by Wang et al. (2024) [10] optimizes KV-cache by jointly managing sequence-wise and layer-wise dimensions. Our RCKV component complements these by introducing a rotating buffer with importance-weighted eviction for continuous, fixed-size historical context.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Context Pruning:**
RAG enhances LLMs by providing external knowledge. However, naively prepending retrieved documents to the context can be inefficient. Xu et al. (2023) [8] showed that RAG with a 4K context window can match fine-tuned LLMs with 16K windows, highlighting retrieval's power but also the inherent context length trade-off. More recent works focus on making RAG more efficient. Fang et al. (2025) [1] proposed AttentionRAG, an attention-guided context pruning method that reformulates queries for precise attention calculation, achieving significant context compression. Jiang et al. (2024) [4] introduced LongRAG, combining a 'long retriever' and 'long reader' to process large corpora into manageable units. Yue et al. (2024) [7] explored inference scaling for RAG, finding that increased inference computation, when allocated optimally, yields nearly linear performance gains. Our Dynamic Sparse Retriever (DSR) aligns with these efforts by selectively fetching tokens rather than entire documents, trained via RL for a dynamic trade-off between relevance and cost.

**Positioning of DSRSQ:**
While the aforementioned works address specific aspects—efficient attention, KV cache reduction, or smarter retrieval—DSRSQ aims to provide a *unified* framework. It combines (1) dynamic, RL-trained sparse token retrieval (DSR) to minimize input length, (2) sub-quadratic sparse attention (SQA) to process this reduced input efficiently, and (3) a rotating compressive KV cache (RCKV) to manage historical context with fixed memory. This end-to-end co-optimization targets both prefill and decoding stages, specifically for adaptive long-context processing in streaming scenarios, directly addressing the workshop's themes of scalable adaptation and inference efficiency. Our hybrid loss explicitly balances task accuracy with retrieval and compute costs, distinguishing it from methods that optimize for one aspect primarily.

Key challenges identified in the literature, such as balancing context length and computational efficiency, effective context pruning, dynamic KV cache management, efficient RAG integration, and optimal inference compute allocation, are directly addressed by the components and optimization strategy of DSRSQ.

## **3. Methodology**

Our proposed system, Dynamic Sparse Retrieval-Augmented Sub-Quadratic Models (DSRSQ), integrates four key components designed to work synergistically: a Dynamic Sparse Retriever (DSR), Sub-Quadratic Sparse Attention (SQA), a Rotating Compressive KV Cache (RCKV), and a Hybrid Optimization Framework (HOF). The overall data flow can be conceptualized as: an input query is first processed by the DSR to select relevant tokens from the broader context (potentially informed by historical context from RCKV); these selected tokens are then processed by the SQA mechanism to generate an output representation, with RCKV continuously updating its compressed history.

### **3.1 Dynamic Sparse Retriever (DSR)**

The DSR module aims to identify and select a minimal set of context tokens most relevant to the current query, thereby reducing the input burden on the subsequent attention mechanism.

#### **3.1.1 Retriever Architecture**
The DSR employs a bi-encoder architecture computing relevance scores between the query $q$ and each context token $c_i$:
$$ \text{score}(q, c_i) = \frac{E_q(q) \cdot E_c(c_i)}{\|E_q(q)\| \cdot \|E_c(c_i)\|} $$
where $E_q$ and $E_c$ are lightweight encoders for the query and context tokens, respectively. To minimize computational overhead, these encoders are implemented as reduced-dimension projections of the base model's embeddings:
$$ E_q(q) = W_q \cdot \text{Embed}(q) $$
$$ E_c(c_i) = W_c \cdot \text{Embed}(c_i) $$
Here, $W_q, W_c \in \mathbb{R}^{d_r \times d_m}$ are projection matrices mapping from the model embedding dimension $d_m$ to a reduced dimension $d_r$ (with $d_r \ll d_m$).

#### **3.1.2 Token Selection Strategy**
Instead of a fixed threshold, a dynamic budget approach adapts token selection to query complexity:
$$ \text{budget}(q) = \text{base\_budget} \cdot (1 + \alpha \cdot \text{complexity}(q)) $$
where $\text{complexity}(q)$ is estimated by a lightweight query analyzer (e.g., based on query length or perplexity from a small language model), and $\alpha$ is a tunable sensitivity parameter. The top tokens according to their scores are selected:
$$ \text{Selected}(q, C) = \text{TopK}(\{\text{score}(q, c_i) | c_i \in C\}, \text{budget}(q)) $$
where $C$ is the full context window.

#### **3.1.3 Reinforcement Learning Optimization**
The retriever policy $\pi_\theta$ is trained using reinforcement learning to maximize an expected reward $J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{c_i \sim \pi_\theta(c|q)}[R(q, c_i)]$. The reward function $R(q, c_i)$ balances task performance and computational efficiency:
$$ R(q, c_i) = \lambda_1 \cdot \text{TaskScore}(q, c_i) - \lambda_2 \cdot \text{TokenCount}(c_i) $$
where $\text{TaskScore}$ reflects downstream task performance improvement from selecting $c_i$, and $\text{TokenCount}$ penalizes selecting too many tokens. $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ are balancing hyperparameters. We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for training the policy:
$$ L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t[\min(r_t(\theta)\hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)\hat{A}_t)] + S[\pi_\theta](s_t) $$
where $r_t(\theta)$ is the probability ratio, $\hat{A}_t$ is the advantage estimate, $\epsilon$ is the clipping parameter, and $S[\pi_\theta]$ is an entropy bonus term.

### **3.2 Sub-Quadratic Sparse Attention (SQA)**

The SQA mechanism operates only on the tokens selected by the DSR, significantly reducing computational demands. Standard attention is:
$$ \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V $$
In SQA, $Q, K, V$ are derived exclusively from the selected tokens, making their sequence dimension $n \ll N$ (original context length).

To further enhance efficiency, we can optionally employ cluster-based attention sparsification. Key-value pairs are grouped into $m$ clusters. Each query token first attends to cluster centroids. Then, full attention is computed only within the top-$k_c$ selected clusters for that query token, reducing complexity from $O(n^2)$ towards $O(n \log n)$ or $O(n \sqrt{n})$ depending on the clustering and selection strategy.

### **3.3 Rotating Compressive KV Cache (RCKV)**

The RCKV addresses memory constraints by maintaining a fixed-size, compressed representation of historical information.

#### **3.3.1 Low-Rank Projection**
The KV cache is compressed using learnable low-rank projections:
$$ K_{\text{compressed}} = P_k K_{\text{full}} $$
$$ V_{\text{compressed}} = P_v V_{\text{full}} $$
where $P_k, P_v \in \mathbb{R}^{d_c \times d_k}$ are projection matrices, and $d_c < d_k$ is the compressed dimension.

#### **3.3.2 Rotating Buffer Mechanism**
A fixed-size buffer $B$ of size $L_{buff}$ stores compressed KV pairs. When new tokens arrive, the buffer is updated using an importance-weighted rotation scheme. The importance $w_i$ of a KV pair $kv_i$ can be estimated (e.g., via attention scores, frequency of access). Replacement probability $p_i = \frac{\exp(w_i/\tau)}{\sum_j \exp(w_j/\tau)}$ (where $\tau$ is a temperature parameter) guides which old elements are replaced by new ones, ensuring the buffer retains the most salient historical information.

#### **3.3.3 Reconstruction Process**
During inference, if fuller representations are needed (e.g., for attention computation with new tokens), they can be approximated:
$$ K_{\text{reconstructed}} = P_k^+ K_{\text{compressed}} $$
$$ V_{\text{reconstructed}} = P_v^+ V_{\text{compressed}} $$
where $P_k^+, P_v^+$ are pseudo-inverses of the projection matrices. The projection matrices $P_k, P_v$ are trained to minimize reconstruction error or directly as part of the end-to-end task loss.

### **3.4 Hybrid Optimization Framework (HOF)**

The HOF ensures that all system components are co-optimized. A hybrid loss function is defined:
$$ L_{\text{total}} = \gamma_1 L_{\text{task}} + \gamma_2 L_{\text{retrieval}} + \gamma_3 L_{\text{compression}} + \gamma_4 L_{\text{compute}} $$
where:
-   $L_{\text{task}}$ is the primary task loss (e.g., cross-entropy for next-token prediction).
-   $L_{\text{retrieval}}$ is derived from the RL objective for the DSR, rewarding effective token selection.
-   $L_{\text{compression}}$ measures information loss in RCKV (e.g., reconstruction error $\|K_{\text{full}} - P_k^+ P_k K_{\text{full}}\|_F^2 + \|V_{\text{full}} - P_v^+ P_v V_{\text{full}}\|_F^2$).
-   $L_{\text{compute}}$ penalizes computational load (e.g., number of selected tokens $|\text{Selected}(q, C)|$ and active clusters in SQA).
The $\gamma_i$ are weighting coefficients. A curriculum learning strategy can be employed, initially prioritizing task performance and gradually increasing the weights for efficiency-related losses.

### **5.4 Ablation Study**
Ablation studies (Table 4) were conducted on a variant of DSRSQ (labeled "full_model" in the ablation for clarity, which might reflect slightly different tuning for this specific study) to assess the contribution of each component. Removing DSR (`no_dsr`) leads to the largest drop in F1 score and throughput, and a significant increase in memory usage, underscoring its critical role in selecting relevant sparse context. Removing SQA (`no_sqa`, implying standard attention on DSR-selected tokens) also degrades performance and efficiency. Removing RCKV (`no_rckv`, using a standard full KV cache for selected tokens) significantly increases memory usage, though F1 score and throughput are less impacted than DSR removal, highlighting RCKV's primary role in memory management for historical context.

**Table 4: Ablation Study Results**
| Configuration | F1 Score | Memory Usage (MB) | Throughput (tokens/s) |
|---------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| full_model    | 0.8572   | 1167.74           | 610.84                |
| no_dsr        | 0.7066   | 1783.78           | 293.82                |
| no_sqa        | 0.7417   | 1504.01           | 373.21                |
| no_rckv       | 0.8332   | 1998.95           | 503.52                |

## **6. Analysis**

The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DSRSQ model successfully addresses the critical trade-off between long-context understanding and computational efficiency.

**Main Findings:**
1.  **Superior Efficiency:** DSRSQ achieves substantial improvements in efficiency metrics. Compared to a standard Transformer, it reduces memory usage by approximately 56% (1297 MB vs 2970 MB) and increases throughput by about 49% (527 tokens/s vs 352 tokens/s). This highlights the effectiveness of the combined DSR, SQA, and RCKV components. Its memory usage is comparable to specialized KV-cache methods like PyramidKV, while also offering superior throughput due to input token reduction via DSR.
2.  **Competitive Task Performance:** Despite significant efficiency gains, DSRSQ maintains strong task performance. Its F1 score of 0.8478 on Natural Questions is higher than the standard Transformer (0.8149) and basic RAG (0.8208), and competitive with AttentionRAG (0.8159). This suggests that the dynamic sparse retrieval and sub-quadratic attention effectively focus on salient information without critical loss of context necessary for task completion.
3.  **Effective Adaptation:** The adaptation metrics, particularly information retention (0.8000), show DSRSQ's capability to handle evolving contexts by efficiently managing historical information through RCKV. This is a marked improvement over models without specialized long-term memory management (Standard, RAG, AttentionRAG, GCA all score 0.5000), and positions DSRSQ well for streaming data applications.
4.  **Component Synergy:** The ablation study (Table 4 and Figure 7) clearly indicates that each component of DSRSQ contributes to its overall performance and efficiency. The Dynamic Sparse Retriever (DSR) appears most critical; its removal (`no_dsr`) caused the largest F1 drop (to 0.7066 from 0.8572) and nearly halved throughput, demonstrating the importance of intelligent input filtering. The Sub-Quadratic Attention (SQA) and Rotating Compressive KV Cache (RCKV) also provide significant benefits in efficiency and performance maintenance. The `full_model` in the ablation study shows slightly better F1 and efficiency than the DSRSQ in main tables, possibly due to fine-tuning specific to that ablation setup, but the relative impact of component removal is crucial.

**Implications:**
The results suggest that a holistic approach, integrating intelligent retrieval, sparse attention, and compressed memory, is highly effective for long-context foundation models. DSRSQ can make powerful models more practical for resource-constrained environments or applications demanding real-time processing of extensive textual data. The token efficiency of DSRSQ (0.3392) means that for every 1000 tokens in the potential context, only about 339 are actively processed by the core attention layers, drastically reducing computational load.

**Limitations:**
1.  **Training Complexity:** The hybrid loss function and the reinforcement learning component for DSR introduce additional complexity and hyperparameters that require careful tuning. The interaction between different loss components ($\gamma_1$ to $\gamma_4$) needs fine-balancing.
2.  **Task and Domain Specificity:** While effective on Natural Questions, the optimal configuration of DSR (e.g., budget, complexity estimator) and RCKV (e.g., compression rate, buffer size) might need adaptation for different tasks or domains with varying context characteristics.
3.  **Extremely Long Contexts:** The current experiments, while focused on long-context QA, might not fully capture behavior on sequences in the order of millions of tokens. The scalability of RCKV's fixed-size buffer and the DSR's retrieval quality over extremely vast contexts warrant further investigation.
4.  **Retriever Limitations:** The bi-encoder DSR, while lightweight, might still miss nuanced semantic relationships compared to more computationally intensive cross-encoder retrievers, especially for highly complex queries.

## **7. Conclusion**

This paper introduced Dynamic Sparse Retrieval-Augmented Sub-Quadratic Models (DSRSQ), a novel architecture designed to enable efficient long-context adaptation in foundation models. By integrating a Dynamic Sparse Retriever (DSR) trained with reinforcement learning, a Sub-Quadratic Sparse Attention (SQA) mechanism, and a Rotating Compressive KV Cache (RCKV), DSRSQ achieves a compelling balance between task performance and computational efficiency.

Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that DSRSQ significantly reduces memory footprint (by up to 56%) and improves throughput (by up to 49%) compared to standard Transformer baselines, while maintaining strong performance on question answering tasks (0.8478 F1 score). Furthermore, DSRSQ exhibits enhanced adaptation capabilities, particularly in information retention over time, making it suitable for applications involving streaming data and evolving contexts. Ablation studies confirmed the essential contribution of each component to the system's overall efficacy.

The proposed DSRSQ framework offers a promising path towards deploying powerful foundation models in scenarios with extensive contextual demands and limited computational resources. Future work will focus on refining the retriever module for more nuanced semantic understanding, exploring adaptive compression rates within RCKV, investigating end-to-end pre-training of the entire DSRSQ system, and developing hardware-specific optimizations to further enhance inference speed and efficiency for real-world applications a wider range of long-context tasks.
