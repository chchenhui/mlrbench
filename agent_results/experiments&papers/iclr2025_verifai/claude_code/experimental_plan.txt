# Experimental Plan for LLM-TAC Framework

## Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness of the LLM-TAC framework in automating tactic generation for interactive theorem provers (ITP), specifically focusing on the Coq proof assistant.

## Datasets
We will use a subset of standard Coq benchmarks:
1. A curated subset of theorems from Coq's standard library (stdlib)
2. A curated subset of theorems from the Mathematical Components library (mathcomp)

For each theorem, we will extract:
- The goal statement
- Local hypotheses
- Relevant context (library imports and definitions)
- Ground truth tactic sequences (from human-written proofs)

## Models
1. **Main Model (LLM-TAC)**: Fine-tuned LLM with reinforcement learning for tactic generation
   - Base Model: We will use a smaller LLM that can run locally (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B)
   - Fine-tuning: Progressive fine-tuning on Coq proof examples

2. **Baseline Models**:
   - **Naive LLM**: An LLM without specialized fine-tuning for theorem proving
   - **In-Context Learning (ICL)**: LLM with few-shot examples but no fine-tuning
   - **Traditional Automated Tactics**: Coq's built-in automated tactics like `auto`, `eauto`, etc.

## Experimental Pipeline

### 1. Data Processing
- Parse Coq source files to extract theorem statements, proofs, and context
- Create a structured dataset with pairs of (proof state, next tactic) for training
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets

### 2. Contextual Encoding
- Encode the goal state, hypotheses, and library context using transformer-based models
- Implement a retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant theorems and lemmas from libraries

### 3. Tactic Generation & Verification
- Generate candidate tactic sequences using the LLM
- Execute the tactics within Coq to verify their correctness
- Log successful sequences and generate counterexamples from failures

### 4. Reinforcement Learning Loop
- Define a reward function based on proof progress and completion
- Implement a policy gradient method for updating the LLM's generation strategy
- Run multiple iterations to improve tactic generation accuracy

### 5. Evaluation
We will evaluate the LLM-TAC framework on the following metrics:

#### Primary Metrics:
- **Tactic Generation Accuracy**: Percentage of generated tactics that are syntactically correct and semantically meaningful
- **Proof Completion Rate**: Percentage of theorems successfully proven by the system
- **Proof Completion Time**: Time taken to complete proofs using generated tactics vs. manual tactics
- **Reduction in Manual Tactic Writing**: Reduction in the number of tactics that need to be written manually

#### Secondary Metrics:
- **Generalization to Unseen Theorems**: Performance on theorems not included in the training data
- **Tactic Diversity**: Variety of tactics generated by the system
- **Learning Efficiency**: Improvement in performance across reinforcement learning iterations

## Experiment Configurations

### 1. Ablation Studies
- LLM-TAC without reinforcement learning
- LLM-TAC without retrieval-augmented context
- LLM-TAC with varying context window sizes

### 2. Comparative Analysis
- Compare LLM-TAC with baseline models on all metrics
- Analyze performance across different types of theorems (arithmetic, list manipulation, etc.)
- Analyze performance on theorems of varying complexity

### 3. Training Progression
- Track performance improvements through reinforcement learning iterations
- Analyze learning curves for different metrics

## Expected Outcomes
- LLM-TAC will outperform baseline models on all primary metrics
- LLM-TAC will achieve at least 50% reduction in manual tactic writing
- Performance will improve significantly across reinforcement learning iterations
- The system will show reasonable generalization to unseen theorems

## Implementation Plan
For this simulated experiment, we will:
1. Create a synthetic dataset representative of Coq proofs
2. Implement a simplified version of the LLM-TAC framework
3. Simulate the execution of tactics rather than using an actual Coq instance
4. Run experiments with various configurations
5. Generate visualizations and tables to present the results
