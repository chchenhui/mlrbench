## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** Developmental Scaffolding for Moral AI: Learning Human Values Through Simulated Psycho-Social Stages

**2. Introduction**

*   **Background:** The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into diverse aspects of human life, from autonomous vehicles to medical diagnosis and content moderation, necessitates that these systems operate in alignment with human values and ethical principles. Ensuring AI safety and alignment is a paramount challenge (Amodei et al., 2016). Current predominant methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), have shown promise in guiding AI behavior (Ganguli et al., 2023). However, RLHF often treats value alignment as a monolithic and static process, primarily optimizing for helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness based on aggregated human preferences. This approach may fail to capture the complexity, context-sensitivity, and developmental nature of human moral reasoning, potentially leading to AI systems that are brittle, lack deep understanding, or reflect only a narrow set of dominant values (Tennant et al., 2023).

    Moral philosophy and psychology offer rich theoretical frameworks for understanding human value systems and ethical reasoning. Theories from developmental moral psychology, notably those pioneered by Lawrence Kohlberg (Kohlberg, 1984) and subsequent researchers, posit that human moral understanding evolves through distinct stages, progressing from self-interest and rule-following to social conformity and, ultimately, to reasoning based on abstract ethical principles and universal rights. This developmental trajectory suggests that complex moral cognition is not acquired instantaneously but is built incrementally through social interaction, cognitive maturation, and exposure to increasingly complex ethical challenges.

    Recent work has begun exploring the intersection of developmental psychology and AI ethics. Studies have investigated using Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to learn culturally specific values (Oliveira et al., 2023), proposed experiential learning cycles for AI moral growth (Endo, 2025), reviewed the application of moral development theories to AI (Doe & Smith, 2024), and explored integrating specific frameworks like Kohlberg's into AI models (Davis & Brown, 2023; Johnson & Williams, 2024). Curriculum learning approaches inspired by development have also been proposed (Lee & Kim, 2024). These efforts highlight a growing recognition that developmental perspectives may offer valuable insights for building more sophisticated and robustly ethical AI. However, a comprehensive, computationally implemented framework that explicitly uses developmental stages as a *scaffolding* mechanism for training AI moral reasoning, progressing through tailored curricula and reinforcement signals, remains largely unexplored. This research proposes to fill this gap by developing and evaluating such a framework, termed "Developmental Scaffolding."

*   **Research Objectives:** This research aims to investigate the potential of leveraging principles from developmental moral psychology to enhance the ethical reasoning capabilities of AI systems. The primary objectives are:
    1.  **Develop a Formal Framework:** Define and formalize the "Developmental Scaffolding" framework for training moral AI, outlining distinct training stages inspired by established theories of human moral development (e.g., Kohlberg's stages).
    2.  **Implement the Framework:** Implement the Developmental Scaffolding framework using contemporary AI architectures, likely large language models (LLMs), capable of complex reasoning and language understanding.
    3.  **Design Stage-Specific Curricula:** Create and curate datasets and reinforcement learning environments tailored to each developmental stage, incorporating appropriate complexity, ethical concepts, and feedback mechanisms (e.g., rule-based rewards, simulated social approval, principle-based critiques).
    4.  **Train AI Models:** Train AI models sequentially through the defined developmental stages, allowing them to progressively build more complex moral reasoning capabilities.
    5.  **Evaluate and Compare:** Empirically evaluate the moral reasoning abilities of the developmentally scaffolded AI compared to baseline models trained using conventional monolithic methods (e.g., standard fine-tuning, RLHF). Assess performance on tasks requiring different levels of moral sophistication, context sensitivity, and justification quality.
    6.  **Analyze Adaptability and Nuance:** Investigate whether the scaffolded approach leads to AI systems that exhibit more nuanced, context-aware, and adaptable moral behavior, particularly when faced with novel or complex ethical dilemmas.

*   **Significance:** This research holds significant potential contributions across multiple domains.
    *   **AI Alignment and Ethics:** It proposes a novel methodology for value alignment that moves beyond static, monolithic approaches. By mirroring aspects of human moral development, Developmental Scaffolding may lead to AI systems with a more grounded, intrinsic, and robust understanding of ethics, enhancing their trustworthiness and reliability. This directly addresses the workshop theme on finding better ways to teach AI human values and exploring alternatives/complements to RLHF.
    *   **Moral Psychology and Cognitive Science:** Implementing developmental theories computationally can serve as a testbed for refining and understanding these theories themselves. Success could provide computational validation for stage-based models of moral development and offer insights into the mechanisms underlying human moral learning. This speaks to the workshop topic of how AI can advance moral psychology.
    *   **Addressing Value Pluralism:** While not explicitly training for diverse cultural values in this initial proposal, the staged approach inherently introduces different value *orientations* (rule-based, social-conventional, principled) that are foundational across many cultures. Progressing through stages might equip AI with a meta-cognitive framework better suited to eventually navigate diverse value systems and avoid amplifying monolithic voices, a key concern highlighted in the workshop topics.
    *   **Interpretability and Trustworthiness:** An AI whose moral reasoning capabilities are developed through identifiable stages might be more interpretable. Understanding which developmental stage predominantly influences its response in a given situation could enhance transparency and trust, aligning with workshop interests in trustworthiness and transparency informed by moral psychology.

**3. Methodology**

*   **Research Design Overview:** This research employs a computational modeling and empirical evaluation design. We will first formalize the Developmental Scaffolding framework based on psychological theory. Second, we will implement this framework by designing stage-specific training procedures for a base AI model (an LLM). Third, we will train models using this staged curriculum. Finally, we will conduct a rigorous evaluation comparing the scaffolded models against baseline models on a suite of moral reasoning tasks.

*   **Framework Formalization: Developmental Scaffolding**
    Inspired by Kohlberg's stages of moral development (Kohlberg, 1984) and the concept of curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009; Lee & Kim, 2024), the Developmental Scaffolding framework will structure AI training into (at least) three sequential stages:

    1.  **Stage 1: Pre-conventional Morality (Rule/Outcome-Orientation)**
        *   *Focus:* Learning based on direct consequences (reward/punishment) and deference to authority/rules. Simple avoidance of harm and maximization of personal gain (within constraints).
        *   *Psychological Analogue:* Obedience and punishment orientation; Self-interest orientation.

    2.  **Stage 2: Conventional Morality (Social Norm/Conformity-Orientation)**
        *   *Focus:* Understanding and internalizing social norms, laws, and expectations. Reasoning based on maintaining social order, gaining approval, and fulfilling duties.
        *   *Psychological Analogue:* Interpersonal accord and conformity; Authority and social-order maintaining orientation.

    3.  **Stage 3: Post-conventional Morality (Principle-Orientation)**
        *   *Focus:* Reasoning based on abstract ethical principles, universal rights, and justice. Evaluating laws and norms against higher-order principles. Ability to handle conflicting values.
        *   *Psychological Analogue:* Social contract orientation; Universal ethical principles orientation.

    The transition between stages will involve not just introducing new data but potentially modifying the learning objective or reinforcement signal to emphasize the corresponding level of reasoning.

*   **Model Implementation:**
    *   *Base Model:* We will utilize a pre-trained open-source Large Language Model (LLM) of significant size (e.g., Llama 2 7B/13B, Mistral 7B, or similar) as the foundation. LLMs are chosen for their strong language understanding and reasoning capabilities, suitable for processing and generating responses related to ethical scenarios.
    *   *Training Procedure:* We will employ sequential fine-tuning. The base LLM will first be fine-tuned on the Stage 1 curriculum. The resulting model will then be further fine-tuned on the Stage 2 curriculum, and subsequently on the Stage 3 curriculum. This sequential process ensures that learning at later stages builds upon the foundations laid in earlier ones. Techniques like parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) (e.g., LoRA) might be explored to manage computational resources and potentially isolate stage-specific adaptations.

*   **Stage-Specific Training Curricula:**
    *   **Stage 1 Curriculum:**
        *   *Data:* Simple scenarios involving explicit rules (e.g., "Do not steal cookies"), direct consequences (e.g., "If you touch the hot stove, you get burned"), and authority commands. Datasets like the Moral Stories dataset (Emelin et al., 2020) might be filtered or adapted. Synthetic data generation focusing on rule-following and outcome prediction will also be employed, potentially using a teacher LLM like GPT-4 prompted with Stage 1 characteristics (inspired by Endo, 2025).
        *   *Learning Signal:* Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on demonstrating understanding of rules and consequences. Reinforcement Learning (RL) with simple reward functions: positive reward ($R^+$) for rule adherence/achieving desired outcomes, negative reward ($R^-$) for rule violation/negative outcomes. Loss function for SFT could be standard cross-entropy: $$ L_{SFT} = - \sum_{i} \log P(\text{token}_i | \text{context}, \text{previous tokens}) $$ For RL, a simple policy gradient method could be used to maximize expected reward $E[\sum_t \gamma^t R_t]$.

    *   **Stage 2 Curriculum:**
        *   *Data:* Scenarios depicting social dilemmas, situations requiring consideration of others' perspectives, social norms, laws, and group harmony. Examples from ethics datasets like ETHICS (Hendrycks et al., 2021) focusing on common sense morality and social conventions. Simulated social interactions where feedback indicates social approval/disapproval. Data reflecting diverse (but common) societal expectations could be sourced or generated, acknowledging the challenge of cultural variability (Oliveira et al., 2023).
        *   *Learning Signal:* SFT on explanations aligning with social norms. RLHF or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), where human preferences favour responses that demonstrate understanding of social context, roles, and maintaining order. The DPO loss encourages the policy $\pi$ to rank preferred completions $y_w$ higher than dispreferred completions $y_l$: $$ L_{DPO}(\pi; \pi_{ref}) = - E_{(x, y_w, y_l) \sim D} \left[ \log \sigma \left( \beta \log \frac{\pi(y_w|x)}{\pi_{ref}(y_w|x)} - \beta \log \frac{\pi(y_l|x)}{\pi_{ref}(y_l|x)} \right) \right] $$ where $\pi_{ref}$ is the reference model, $\beta$ is a hyperparameter, and $D$ is the preference dataset.

    *   **Stage 3 Curriculum:**
        *   *Data:* Complex ethical dilemmas involving conflicting values (e.g., variations of trolley problems, medical ethics cases, AI safety scenarios from datasets like ETHICS). Excerpts from philosophical texts discussing ethical principles (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics). Scenarios requiring nuanced justification based on abstract principles.
        *   *Learning Signal:* Constitutional AI principles (Bai et al., 2022) could be adapted, where the AI learns to critique and revise its responses based on adherence to explicitly stated ethical principles (the "constitution"). RL with reward signals based on human evaluation of the *quality and consistency* of principled reasoning and justification, not just the outcome. SFT on expert demonstrations of ethical reasoning. Techniques exploring moral self-correction (Ganguli et al., 2023) could be relevant here, prompting the model to justify its reasoning against defined principles.

*   **Experimental Design:**
    *   **Baseline Models:**
        1.  *Base LLM:* The pre-trained LLM without any moral fine-tuning.
        2.  *Monolithic SFT:* The base LLM fine-tuned on a mixture of all training data from Stages 1-3 simultaneously.
        3.  *Monolithic RLHF/DPO:* The base LLM fine-tuned using RLHF or DPO on a general "helpfulness and harmlessness" objective, trained on a dataset comparable in size and diversity to the combined staged curriculum.
    *   **Evaluation Tasks:**
        1.  *Stage-Specific Probes:* Tasks designed to specifically test capabilities expected at each stage (e.g., rule identification accuracy for Stage 1, social norm conformity score for Stage 2, principled justification rating for Stage 3).
        2.  *Standard Ethics Benchmarks:* Evaluate on established benchmarks like the ETHICS dataset (commonsense morality, justice, deontology, utilitarianism subsets) and potentially adapted versions of Moral Foundations Vignettes (Graham et al., 2011).
        3.  *Complex Dilemma Resolution:* Present novel, complex ethical dilemmas (potentially generated or sourced from contemporary issues) and evaluate the quality, coherence, and ethical soundness of the AI's proposed solutions and justifications.
        4.  *Context Sensitivity Analysis:* Evaluate how models adapt their responses when key contextual details of a dilemma are altered (e.g., changing stakeholder identities, severity of consequences).
        5.  *Robustness Testing:* Assess performance against adversarial inputs designed to elicit unethical or inconsistent responses.
    *   **Evaluation Metrics:**
        *   *Quantitative:* Accuracy on classification tasks (e.g., identifying rule violations), ROUGE/BLEU scores for justification generation (compared to reference justifications where applicable), alignment scores using automated metrics (e.g., perspective API, HHH criteria from HELM), scores on standard benchmarks. We can measure consistency with chosen principles using embedding similarity: $ Sim(E_{response}, E_{principle}) $.
        *   *Qualitative:* Human evaluations (using expert raters or crowdsourcing with clear rubrics) assessing:
            *   Ethical soundness of decisions/recommendations.
            *   Quality and coherence of justifications.
            *   Apparent stage of reasoning demonstrated.
            *   Context sensitivity and nuance.
            *   Overall trustworthiness.
            Likert scales (1-5) and pairwise comparisons (A/B testing between scaffolded and baseline models) will be used.

*   **Addressing Challenges:**
    *   *Cultural Variability:* This initial study focuses on establishing the framework based on widely discussed developmental stages (often Western-centric). We acknowledge this limitation and will use diverse data where possible within stages (e.g., varied social norms in Stage 2). Future work must explicitly address cross-cultural adaptation.
    *   *Scalability:* We will use PEFT and efficient implementation strategies. The staged approach might be more scalable than trying to learn complex principles from scratch monolithically.
    *   *Evaluation:* We employ a mixed-methods evaluation (quantitative benchmarks and qualitative human judgment) to provide a holistic assessment of moral reasoning.
    *   *Integration:* By using sequential fine-tuning on standard LLM architectures, we aim for practical integration.
    *   *Societal Implications:* We will carefully curate data to avoid harmful bias propagation and focus evaluation on ethical soundness, explicitly comparing against baselines known to sometimes produce problematic outputs. The project's goal is to *improve* ethical alignment.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

*   **Expected Outcomes:**
    1.  **A Functional Developmental Scaffolding Framework:** A documented methodology and codebase implementing the staged training approach for LLMs.
    2.  **Empirical Evidence:** Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrating the comparative performance of the developmentally scaffolded AI against monolithic baselines on diverse moral reasoning tasks. We anticipate finding that the scaffolded model exhibits:
        *   Improved performance on tasks requiring higher stages of moral reasoning (e.g., principled justification).
        *   Enhanced context sensitivity in ethical dilemmas.
        *   Greater robustness against simplistic failures compared to purely rule-based or norm-based models (i.e., models stopped after Stage 1 or 2).
        *   Potentially higher ratings on human evaluations for justification quality and ethical soundness.
    3.  **Stage-Specific Capabilities:** Analysis confirming that the model demonstrates characteristics associated with the targeted developmental stages after each phase of training.
    4.  **Insights into AI Moral Learning:** A better understanding of how curriculum structure and sequenced learning objectives influence the development of complex reasoning abilities in AI, specifically in the ethical domain.
    5.  **Limitations Identified:** A clear articulation of the framework's limitations (e.g., reliance on specific psychological models, data biases, scalability constraints) and avenues for future research.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Scientific Contribution:** This research will make a significant contribution to the field of AI ethics and alignment by introducing and validating a novel, psychologically-grounded training paradigm. It provides a concrete application of moral psychology theory to AI practice, directly addressing the core theme of the workshop. It will also contribute to the computational modeling of human moral development, potentially offering new tools and perspectives for psychologists and cognitive scientists.
    *   **Technological Advancement:** If successful, Developmental Scaffolding offers a pathway toward AI systems that possess more nuanced, adaptable, and potentially more trustworthy ethical reasoning capabilities than those trained via current standard methods. This could be crucial for deploying AI safely in complex, real-world scenarios requiring sophisticated ethical judgment.
    *   **Societal Relevance:** By exploring methods that aim for deeper ethical understanding rather than surface-level mimicry, this work contributes to the long-term goal of developing AI systems that are truly beneficial and aligned with complex human values. The staged approach, by incorporating different levels of reasoning (rules, norms, principles), offers a potential framework for eventually integrating more diverse perspectives compared to monolithic alignment techniques, addressing concerns about value representation in AI. This research fosters interdisciplinary dialogue between AI, philosophy, and psychology, enriching all involved fields.

In conclusion, the proposed research on Developmental Scaffolding offers a promising, theory-driven approach to cultivating more sophisticated moral reasoning in AI systems. By systematically building ethical understanding through stages, we aim to develop AI that is not only aligned but also exhibits greater depth, adaptability, and trustworthiness in its ethical decision-making.
