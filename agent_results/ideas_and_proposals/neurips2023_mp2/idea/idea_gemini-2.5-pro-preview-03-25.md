**Title:** Developmental Scaffolding for Moral AI: Learning Values Through Simulated Social Stages

**Motivation:** Current methods like RLHF often treat value alignment as a static process, potentially overlooking the developmental nature of human moral reasoning. Theories from developmental moral psychology suggest humans acquire complex moral understanding through stages. Applying this staged approach could lead to more robust and nuanced AI morality.

**Main Idea:** We propose training AI systems through a curriculum inspired by developmental moral psychology stages (e.g., Kohlberg's stages). Initially, the AI learns simple rules and consequences (pre-conventional). Then, it progresses to understanding social norms and expectations (conventional). Finally, it learns to reason about abstract ethical principles and universal rights (post-conventional). This "Developmental Scaffolding" will use varied training data and reinforcement signals tailored to each stage, potentially including simulated social interactions or ethical dilemma scenarios of increasing complexity. The expected outcome is an AI demonstrating more sophisticated and context-aware moral reasoning compared to monolithically trained systems, potentially enhancing trustworthiness and adaptability.
