# GenoCircuit: A Foundation Model for Multi-Scale Regulatory Dependency Learning in Genomic Networks  

---

## 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) govern cellular behavior by coordinating the expression of thousands of genes in response to dynamic environmental and developmental signals. Dysregulation of these networks underpins diseases ranging from cancer to autoimmune disorders. Traditional approaches for modeling GRNs—such as linear regression, Bayesian networks, and co-expression analysis—fail to capture non-linear interactions, long-range genomic dependencies, and context-specific regulatory patterns. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled progress in GRN inference, but fundamental challenges persist: (1) existing models struggle to integrate multimodal genomic data (e.g., chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, and single-cell expression), (2) most architectures lack explicit mechanisms to represent hierarchical regulatory circuits, and (3) few methods provide actionable insights into therapeutic interventions.  

This proposal addresses these gaps by introducing a foundation model tailored for genomic regulatory circuits, leveraging advancements in attention mechanisms, graph neural networks (GNNs), and perturbation-response modeling to build predictive and interpretable representations of gene regulation.  

**Research Objectives**  
1. Develop a multi-scale attention architecture to model local sequence features (e.g., transcription factor binding sites) and global regulatory patterns (e.g., enhancer-promoter loops).  
2. Design a graph induction module to explicitly learn dynamic gene-gene and enhancer-gene interactions across cellular contexts.  
3. Integrate a perturbation prediction framework to simulate the effects of genetic or chemical interventions on regulatory circuits.  
4. Validate the model’s ability to (a) infer causal regulatory relationships and (b) prioritize therapeutic targets using multimodal genomic datasets.  

**Significance**  
By unifying multi-omic data into a coherent framework for regulatory circuit analysis, GenoCircuit will enable *in silico* hypothesis testing for drug discovery. The model’s perturbation-response capabilities could reduce the cost of preclinical validation by prioritizing high-confidence targets for gene therapies, RNA drugs, and small molecules. Its interpretable architecture will also advance precision medicine by elucidating context-specific disease mechanisms.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Data Collection & Preprocessing  
**Datasets**:  
- **Baseline Regulatory Maps**: ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics data (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, Hi-C) across 100+ cell types.  
- **Expression & Variation**: Single-cell RNA-seq from GTEx, TCGA, and perturbation screens (CRISPR, siRNA).  
- **Gene Annotations**: GENCODE transcript models and experimentally validated enhancer-promoter pairs.  

**Preprocessing**:  
- **Sequence Encoding**: DNA sequences (enhancers, promoters) embedded using a hybrid of k-mer frequencies and transformer-based embeddings.  
- **Graph Construction**: Initial graph edges defined using Hi-C contact matrices and motif-based TF-gene associations, refined during training.  

### 2.2 Model Architecture  

#### **Component 1: Multi-Scale Attention**  
A hybrid architecture combines *local context modeling* (convolutional layers) with *global dependency capture* (transformer blocks):  

**Local Module**:  
- **Input**: DNA sequences (100–10,000 bp regions)  
- **Layers**:  
  1. 1D convolutions ($k=9$, stride=3) with residual connections.  
  2. Dilated convolutions to increase receptive field.  
$$ \mathbf{H}_{\text{local}} = \text{DConv}(\text{ReLU}(\text{Conv1D}(\mathbf{X}_{\text{seq}}))) $$  

**Global Module**:  
- **Input**: Gene expression ($\mathbf{X}_{\text{expr}}$) and chromatin state ($\mathbf{X}_{\text{chrom}}$)  
- **Layers**:  
  1. Cross-attention between genes using multi-head self-attention.  
  2. Positional encoding for genomic coordinates.  
$$
\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{X}_{\text{expr}}\mathbf{W}_Q, \quad \mathbf{K} = \mathbf{X}_{\text{chrom}}\mathbf{W}_K, \quad \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{X}_{\text{chrom}}\mathbf{W}_V \\
\mathbf{H}_{\text{global}} = \text{Softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)\mathbf{V}
$$  

#### **Component 2: Regulatory Graph Induction**  
A dynamic GNN learns spatio-temporal regulatory dependencies:  
- **Node Features**: Gene/region embeddings from Component 1.  
- **Edge Inference**: Self-supervised adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$ initialized from Hi-C and trained via:  
$$
\mathbf{A}_{ij} = \sigma\left(\text{GATv2}(\mathbf{h}_i, \mathbf{h}_j)\right)
$$  
where GATv2 is a graph attention layer with dynamic attention coefficients.  

#### **Component 3: Perturbation Prediction**  
A variational graph autoencoder predicts transcriptional responses to perturbations:  
$$
\mathbf{z} \sim q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{X}), \quad \mathbf{\hat{Y}} = p_\theta(\mathbf{Y}|\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{A}, \Delta)
$$  
Here, $\Delta$ represents intervention types (e.g., CRISPR knockouts), and $\mathbf{\hat{Y}}$ is the predicted expression change.  

### 2.3 Training Strategy  
**Pre-training**: Masked gene imputation on unperturbed data (90% of training set).  
**Fine-tuning**: Two-stage process:  
1. **Supervised GRN Inference**: Train on curated TF-gene interactions (ENCODE).  
2. **Perturbation Modeling**: Optimize using CRISPR screens with triplet loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L} = \sum_{(i,j,k)} \max(0, \alpha + d(\mathbf{\hat{Y}}_i, \mathbf{\hat{Y}}_j) - d(\mathbf{\hat{Y}}_i, \mathbf{\hat{Y}}_k))
$$  
where $d$ is cosine distance, and triples $(i,j,k)$ represent similar/dissimilar perturbations.  

### 2.4 Experimental Design  

**Baselines**: Q-GAT [1], DiscoGen [2], GCBLANE [3], GATv2 [4]  
**Datasets**:  
- *Synthetic GRNs*: Simulated data with known ground-truth edges.  
- *ENCODE-CRISPR*: 50K perturbation-response pairs across 10 cell lines.  
- *TCGA Pan-Cancer*: Survival analysis using GRN-derived biomarkers.  

**Metrics**:  
1. **GRN Inference**: AUROC, AUPRC, Precision@K.  
2. **Perturbation Prediction**: Mean squared error (MSE), Top-50 accuracy.  
3. **Scalability**: Training time per epoch, GPU memory usage.  
4. **Interpretability**: Causal effect size analysis via Shapley values.  

**Ablation Studies**:  
- Impact of multi-scale attention vs. pure transformer/GNN architectures.  
- Benefits of dynamic graph induction over static prior knowledge.

2. Discovery of novel regulatory interactions (e.g., enhancer hijacking in cancer) validated via CRISPRi-FISH.  
3. A perturbation atlas predicting transcriptional outcomes for 1,000+ gene knockouts.  

**Translational Impact**:  
- **Therapeutic Target Identification**: Prioritize high-value targets for RNA-based drugs by ranking genes with maximal downstream regulatory influence.  
- **Clinical Applications**: Predict patient-specific responses to therapies using TCGA-derived GRN signatures.  
- **Cost Reduction**: Cut preclinical trial costs by 30% through *in silico* screening of genetic interventions.  

**Broader Implications**:  
GenoCircuit will establish a new paradigm for data-driven genomics, enabling causal inference at scale. By open-sourcing the framework, we aim to accelerate research in gene therapy design and cellular engineering.
