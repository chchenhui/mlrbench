**Key Challenges**:

1. **Lack of Interpretable Anchors**: Existing methods often fail to provide semantically meaningful anchors that facilitate understanding and intervention in the alignment process.

2. **Limited Generalizability**: Alignment measures may not generalize well across different domains or types of representations, limiting their applicability.

3. **Insufficient Integration of Semantic Information**: Many approaches do not adequately incorporate semantic structures, leading to representations that may not align with human cognition.

4. **Challenges in Measuring Alignment**: Developing robust and generalizable metrics to quantify representational alignment remains a significant challenge.

5. **Intervention Mechanisms**: There is a need for effective methods to systematically increase or decrease representational alignment between biological and artificial systems.
