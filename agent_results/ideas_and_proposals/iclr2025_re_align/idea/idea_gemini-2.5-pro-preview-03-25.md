**Title:** Controllable Representational Alignment through Targeted Training Objectives

**Motivation:** Understanding and controlling representational alignment between AI systems, or between AI and biological systems, is crucial for interpretability, transfer learning, and brain-computer interfaces. Current approaches often observe alignment post-hoc; we lack methods to proactively *induce* or *reduce* alignment in specific ways during training.

**Main Idea:** We propose incorporating representational alignment metrics directly into the training loss function of AI models. By selecting a target representation (e.g., from another model, or brain recordings) and a desired level of alignment (measured by metrics like CKA or RSA), we can train a model to explicitly match or diverge from the target's representational geometry. This could involve adding a regularization term that penalizes or rewards representational similarity on specific data subsets or conceptual dimensions. Expected outcomes include demonstrating controllable increases/decreases in alignment and analyzing the trade-offs with primary task performance. This enables systematic study of alignment's functional consequences and facilitates building AI with desired representational properties.
