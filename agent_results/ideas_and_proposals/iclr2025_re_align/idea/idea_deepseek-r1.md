**Title:** Unified Metric Framework for Cross-Modal Representational Alignment  

**Motivation:** Current metrics for measuring representational alignment (e.g., CKA, RSA) are siloed, lack generalizability across domains, and poorly correlate with behavioral outcomes. This fragmentation impedes progress in understanding shared computational strategies and designing interventions for alignment. A unified framework is needed to systematically evaluate and compare metrics, fostering consensus and reproducibility.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a meta-metric framework that integrates existing alignment measures (e.g., similarity-based, task-probing) with novel task-driven evaluations. The framework will:  
1. **Benchmark metrics** on a multimodal dataset (e.g., paired neural recordings, model activations, and behavioral data across vision, language, and decision-making tasks).  
2. **Quantify robustness** by testing sensitivity to noise, adversarial perturbations, and cross-domain shifts.  
3. **Link to behavior** by correlating metric scores with downstream task performance (e.g., transfer learning efficiency, human-model agreement).  
4. **Propose guidelines** for metric selection based on context (e.g., modality, alignment goal).  

Expected outcomes include identifying metrics that generalize across systems and tasks, revealing gaps in current approaches, and enabling reproducible alignment interventions. This could accelerate progress in interpretability, brain-inspired AI, and value-aligned system design.
