1. **Title**: Hybrid Foundation Models with Differentiable Physics for Scientific Discovery  
2. **Motivation**: Modern physical sciences demand models that balance data-driven flexibility with adherence to physical laws. While foundation models (e.g., transformers) excel in capturing complex patterns, they often ignore domain-specific inductive biases (e.g., conservation laws), leading to unphysical predictions. Conversely, physics-driven models struggle with scalability and adaptability to large datasets. Bridging this gap is critical for challenges like climate modeling or materials discovery, where interpretability, robustness, and extrapolation beyond training data are paramount.  
3. **Main Idea**: Propose a hybrid framework integrating foundation models with differentiable physics layers, enabling seamless fusion of data-driven learning and physical constraints. The architecture embeds physics-based differentiable modules (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations for fluid dynamics) into transformer blocks, allowing gradients to propagate through both ML and physics components during training. This leverages simulation-based inference and differentiable programming to align predictions with known laws while retaining the expressive power of foundation models. The approach will be validated on tasks like turbulent flow prediction or phase transition modeling, where physical consistency and long-term extrapolation are essential. Expected outcomes include improved generalization, reduced data requirements via physics-guided regularization, and interpretable attention mechanisms highlighting causal physical interactions. This work advances ML for PS by enabling scalable, physics-respecting models and enriches ML research by demonstrating how hardwired scientific knowledge can enhance foundation model robustness in high-dimensional, noisy domains.
