# Physics-Guided Self-Supervised Learning for Scientific Discovery in Data-Limited Regimes

## 1. Introduction

The intersection of machine learning (ML) and the physical sciences has emerged as a promising frontier for scientific discovery. Machine learning's capacity to identify patterns in complex data complements the physical sciences' rigorous theoretical foundations, creating opportunities for transformative advances. However, this synergy faces significant challenges: traditional deep learning models often require massive labeled datasets to achieve high performance, while scientific domains frequently face data scarcity due to expensive experimental procedures, limited observational capabilities, or rare phenomena.

Additionally, ML models trained solely on data often generate predictions that violate established physical laws. For instance, a neural network predicting fluid dynamics might produce solutions that violate conservation of mass, or a model forecasting molecular configurations might generate physically impossible structures. Such inconsistencies significantly diminish the utility of these models in scientific applications where adherence to physical constraints is non-negotiable.

Recent developments in self-supervised learning (SSL) have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision and natural language processing by leveraging unlabeled data through cleverly designed pretext tasks. These approaches learn rich representations by solving auxiliary tasks created from the data itself, without requiring explicit labels. While promising, conventional SSL approaches remain agnostic to domain-specific physical constraints, limiting their effectiveness for scientific problems where physical consistency is paramount.

This research aims to bridge this critical gap by developing Physics-Guided Self-Supervised Learning (PG-SSL), a novel framework that integrates physical inductive biases into self-supervised pretraining for scientific applications. PG-SSL represents a fundamental advancement in how we approach machine learning for the physical sciences, creating a bridge between purely data-driven approaches and physics-based modeling.

The key research objectives of this proposal are:

1. Develop a unified framework for incorporating physical constraints and domain knowledge into self-supervised learning pipelines
2. Design physics-aware pretext tasks that simultaneously promote rich representation learning and physical consistency
3. Implement differentiable physics modules that can guide representation learning through soft constraints during pretraining
4. Evaluate the framework's effectiveness across multiple scientific domains (fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, and cosmology) in data-limited regimes
5. Analyze the transfer learning capabilities of PG-SSL pretrained models to downstream scientific tasks

The significance of this research extends to both the machine learning and physical sciences communities. For machine learning, PG-SSL introduces a novel paradigm for representation learning that leverages scientific principles as inductive biases, potentially inspiring new approaches to incorporating domain knowledge in other fields. For the physical sciences, PG-SSL offers a data-efficient approach to building predictive models that maintain physical consistency while requiring significantly fewer labeled examples than conventional methods. This could accelerate scientific discovery in data-limited regimes, making advanced ML techniques accessible to a broader range of scientific problems where data collection is expensive or limited.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Framework Overview

The proposed Physics-Guided Self-Supervised Learning (PG-SSL) framework consists of three main components:

1. **Physics-aware pretext tasks**: Novel self-supervised learning objectives that incorporate physical laws and domain knowledge
2. **Differentiable physics modules**: Computational units that enable the enforcement of physical constraints during training
3. **Multi-scale representation learning**: Techniques to capture both local interactions and global physical properties

The framework will be designed to be modular and adaptable to various scientific domains, with specific implementations for three case studies: fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, and cosmological structure formation.

### 2.2 Physics-Aware Pretext Tasks

We propose three categories of physics-aware pretext tasks that form the cornerstone of our approach:

#### 2.2.1 Conservation-Guided Prediction

This task requires the model to predict future states or missing components of physical systems while preserving fundamental conservation laws. The self-supervised objective is formulated as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{reconstruction}} + \lambda_{\text{cons}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{conservation}}$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{reconstruction}}$ is a standard reconstruction loss (e.g., mean squared error), and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{conservation}}$ measures violations of relevant conservation laws. For example, in fluid dynamics, we enforce mass and momentum conservation:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{conservation}} = \left\| \nabla \cdot \hat{\mathbf{v}} \right\|_2^2 + \left\| \frac{\partial \hat{\mathbf{v}}}{\partial t} + \hat{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \nabla \hat{\mathbf{v}} + \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla \hat{p} - \nu \nabla^2 \hat{\mathbf{v}} \right\|_2^2$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{v}}$ and $\hat{p}$ are the predicted velocity field and pressure, respectively.

#### 2.2.2 Symmetry-Preserving Contrastive Learning

We extend contrastive learning by designing positive pairs based on physical symmetries, ensuring that the learned representations respect invariances inherent to the physical system. The contrastive loss is defined as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_j^+)/\tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^{2N} \mathbbm{1}_{k \neq i}\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_k)/\tau)}$$

where $z_i$ and $z_j^+$ are embeddings of physically equivalent states (e.g., rotated molecular configurations with equivalent energy), $\text{sim}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the cosine similarity, and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.

#### 2.2.3 Multi-scale Physical Consistency

This task encourages the model to learn representations that maintain consistency across different scales of physical phenomena. For each sample $x$, we generate a multi-scale representation $\{x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, ..., x^{(S)}\}$ where each $x^{(s)}$ represents the system at a different scale. The loss function is:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{multi-scale}} = \sum_{s=1}^{S-1} \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}}(f_{\text{up}}(E(x^{(s+1)})), x^{(s)}) + \lambda_{\text{phys}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{phys-consist}}(\{E(x^{(s)})\}_{s=1}^S)$$

where $E$ is the encoder, $f_{\text{up}}$ is an upsampling function, and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{phys-consist}}$ enforces consistency with appropriate physical scaling laws.

### 2.3 Differentiable Physics Modules

To enforce physical constraints during training, we develop differentiable physics modules that can be integrated into the neural network architecture. These modules implement numerical approximations of relevant physical equations using differentiable operations. For each domain, we design specific modules:

- **Fluid Dynamics**: Differentiable Navier-Stokes solver using finite difference methods:
  
  $$\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} = -(\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v} - \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v}$$
  
  $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$$

- **Molecular Dynamics**: Differentiable force field calculator based on interatomic potentials:
  
  $$\mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U(\{\mathbf{r}_j\})$$
  
  where $U$ is the potential energy function and $\{\mathbf{r}_j\}$ are atomic positions.

- **Cosmology**: Differentiable gravitational evolution module based on the Poisson equation:
  
  $$\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \delta \rho$$
  
  where $\Phi$ is the gravitational potential and $\delta \rho$ is the density fluctuation.

These modules enable backpropagation through physical simulations, allowing the model to learn representations that minimize both the self-supervised loss and the physical constraint violations.

### 2.4 Neural Network Architecture

We employ a deep neural network architecture consisting of:

1. **Encoder** $E_\theta: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Z}$ that maps input data to a latent representation
2. **Task-specific heads** $f_{\phi_i}: \mathcal{Z} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}_i$ for each pretext task
3. **Differentiable physics modules** $\mathcal{P}_j$ integrated at appropriate locations

The overall architecture can be represented as:

$$\hat{y}_i = f_{\phi_i}(E_\theta(x))$$

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \sum_i \lambda_i \mathcal{L}_i(\hat{y}_i, y_i) + \sum_j \lambda_j \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{P}_j}$$

where $\mathcal{L}_i$ are the pretext task-specific losses and $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{P}_j}$ are the physics consistency losses.

### 2.5 Data Collection and Preprocessing

For each domain, we will curate datasets from existing sources and generate synthetic data using high-fidelity simulations:

- **Fluid Dynamics**: We will use the Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database (JHTDB) and supplement it with simulations from OpenFOAM for various Reynolds numbers and boundary conditions.
  
- **Molecular Dynamics**: We will leverage the QM9 dataset for small molecules and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for biomolecular structures, augmented with trajectories simulated using GROMACS.
  
- **Cosmology**: We will use N-body simulations from the IllustrisTNG project and observational data from galaxy surveys (SDSS, DES).

For each dataset, we will create multiple partitions with varying amounts of labeled data to evaluate performance in low-data regimes.

### 2.6 Experimental Design

#### 2.6.2 Evaluation Metrics

We will assess performance using:

- **Predictive Accuracy**: Mean squared error (MSE), relative L2 error, and domain-specific metrics
- **Physical Consistency**: Conservation error, symmetry violation scores, and other physics-based metrics
- **Data Efficiency**: Performance vs. number of labeled examples (sample complexity curves)
- **Computational Efficiency**: Training time, inference time, and parameter count
- **Generalization**: Performance on out-of-distribution test cases

#### 2.6.3 Ablation Studies

We will conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component:
- Impact of different physics-aware pretext tasks
- Contribution of each differentiable physics module
- Effect of various hyperparameters (e.g., weighting coefficients for loss terms)
- Performance with and without multi-scale representation learning

#### 2.6.4 Experimental Protocol

For each domain, we will:
1. Pretrain the model using PG-SSL on unlabeled data
2. Fine-tune on small labeled datasets of varying sizes
3. Evaluate on held-out test sets
4. Compare against baseline methods using the same evaluation protocol
5. Analyze physical consistency and interpretability of learned representations

### 2.7 Implementation Details

The framework will be implemented using PyTorch with JAX integration for differentiable physics modules. We will leverage GPU acceleration and distributed training for large-scale experiments. The codebase will be modular to facilitate adaptation to different scientific domains and will be open-sourced to promote reproducibility and extension by the research community.
