# LLM-TAC: Transformer-Augmented Tactic Generation for Interactive Theorem Proving

## 1. Introduction

Interactive theorem proving (ITP) systems like Coq, Lean, and Isabelle have become essential tools for formal verification of mathematical theories and software systems. These tools provide rigorous frameworks for constructing machine-checked proofs, ensuring correctness at a fundamental level. However, despite their demonstrated utility in critical applications ranging from verified compilers (CompCert) to formalized mathematics (Lean's mathlib), the widespread adoption of ITPs remains limited due to the substantial expertise required to effectively use them.

The primary bottleneck in ITP adoption lies in the manual engineering of tacticsâ€”the specialized commands used to advance proof states. Constructing effective proof tactics demands both domain expertise and intimate knowledge of the theorem prover's tactic language. This requirement creates a steep learning curve that restricts ITP usage primarily to specialists, limiting the broader impact of formal methods in software development and mathematical research.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating code, including specialized languages like those used in theorem provers. Works like LeanDojo (Yang et al., 2023), LLMSTEP (Welleck & Saha, 2023), and COPRA (Thakur et al., 2023) have shown promising results in leveraging LLMs to assist with theorem proving. However, these approaches often suffer from limitations in contextual understanding, generating tactics that fail to properly account for the current proof state, or lack sufficient integration with the verification feedback loop that human proof engineers naturally employ.

In this research proposal, we introduce LLM-TAC, a novel framework that bridges the gap between probabilistic language models and formal verification systems. LLM-TAC uses a two-stage approach that combines the generative power of fine-tuned language models with the rigorous verification capabilities of interactive theorem provers. By encoding rich contextual information about proof states and employing a reinforcement learning loop that incorporates mechanical verification feedback, LLM-TAC aims to significantly reduce the manual effort required in proof development.

Our research objectives are threefold:
1. Develop a robust encoding mechanism that accurately captures the semantic content of proof states, including goals, hypotheses, and relevant library theorems.
2. Design and implement a tactic generation pipeline that produces syntactically valid and semantically meaningful tactics tailored to specific proof obligations.
3. Create a closed-loop reinforcement learning system that leverages proof success and failure signals to continuously improve tactic generation quality.

The significance of this research extends beyond mere automation. By reducing the cognitive load associated with tactic engineering, LLM-TAC has the potential to democratize access to formal methods, enabling researchers and developers with domain expertise but limited theorem proving experience to leverage the power of formal verification. Furthermore, by integrating probabilistic methods with formal verification in a principled manner, this work contributes to the emerging field at the intersection of AI and formal methods, addressing a key theme of the VerifAI workshop.

## 2. Methodology

Our methodology encompasses three main components: (1) a contextual encoding mechanism that transforms theorem proving contexts into representations suitable for language models, (2) a tactic generation pipeline that produces candidate tactics, and (3) a verification and reinforcement learning system that evaluates and improves tactic quality. We detail each component below.

### 2.1 Contextual Encoding

The effectiveness of language models in generating appropriate tactics depends critically on their understanding of the current proof state. We propose a comprehensive encoding approach that captures the full context necessary for tactic generation:

1. **Goal State Representation**: For each proof obligation, we encode the current goal using a specialized tokenization scheme that preserves the logical structure while making it accessible to the language model. Specifically, for a goal $G$, we generate a linearized representation that maintains type information and logical connectives:

   $$E_G(G) = \text{Tokenize}(\text{Serialize}(G))$$

   where Serialize converts the internal goal representation to a standardized text format, and Tokenize maps this text to token sequences suitable for the language model.

2. **Hypothesis Context**: We encode the local hypotheses $H = \{h_1, h_2, ..., h_n\}$ available in the current proof context:

   $$E_H(H) = \text{Concat}([\text{Tokenize}(\text{Serialize}(h_i)) \text{ for } h_i \in H])$$

3. **Retrieval-Augmented Library Context**: Rather than encoding the entire library, which would exceed context windows of most models, we employ a retrieval-augmented approach. For a given goal $G$ and hypotheses $H$, we identify the $k$ most relevant theorems $T = \{t_1, t_2, ..., t_k\}$ from the available libraries:

   $$T = \text{TopK}(\text{Sim}(G \cup H, L), k)$$

   where $L$ is the set of all library theorems, Sim computes semantic similarity using embedding models fine-tuned on theorem proving data, and TopK selects the $k$ theorems with highest similarity scores.

The complete context representation is then:

$$C(G, H, T) = [\text{GOAL}: E_G(G); \text{HYPOTHESES}: E_H(H); \text{RELEVANT\_THEOREMS}: E_T(T)]$$

This representation is fed to the language model, providing it with the necessary context to generate appropriate tactics.

### 2.2 Tactic Generation Pipeline

Given the encoded context, our tactic generation pipeline produces candidate tactics through the following process:

1. **Base Model Selection and Fine-tuning**: We start with a pretrained large language model (e.g., Llama 3 70B or GPT-4) and fine-tune it on a corpus of proof states and corresponding successful tactics. The fine-tuning objective is:

   $$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = -\sum_{(c, t) \in D} \log P_\theta(t|c)$$

   where $D$ is the dataset of context-tactic pairs, $c$ is the encoded context, $t$ is the corresponding successful tactic, and $P_\theta$ is the model with parameters $\theta$.

2. **Candidate Generation**: For a given proof context $c$, we generate $n$ candidate tactic sequences using temperature sampling:

   $$T_{\text{cand}} = \{t_i \sim P_\theta(\cdot|c) \text{ for } i = 1, 2, ..., n\}$$

   Temperature sampling allows for diversity in the generated tactics, increasing the likelihood of finding successful approaches.

3. **Tactic Verification**: Each candidate tactic $t_i$ is executed within the interactive theorem prover to evaluate its effect on the proof state:

   $$R(t_i, c) = \begin{cases}
   (\text{SUCCESS}, s') & \text{if } t_i \text{ successfully advances from state } c \text{ to } s' \\
   (\text{PARTIAL}, s', g') & \text{if } t_i \text{ advances to } s' \text{ with subgoals } g' \\
   (\text{FAILURE}, e) & \text{if } t_i \text{ fails with error } e
   \end{cases}$$

4. **Candidate Ranking**: We rank the candidates based on their verification results, prioritizing those that make the most progress toward completing the proof:

   $$\text{Score}(t_i, c) = \begin{cases}
   2 & \text{if } R(t_i, c) = (\text{SUCCESS}, \cdot) \\
   1 - \frac{|g'|}{|g|+1} & \text{if } R(t_i, c) = (\text{PARTIAL}, \cdot, g') \\
   -1 & \text{if } R(t_i, c) = (\text{FAILURE}, \cdot)
   \end{cases}$$

   where $|g'|$ is the number of subgoals after applying the tactic, and $|g|$ is the number of current goals.

The highest-ranked tactic is then presented to the user or applied automatically in an autonomous proof search.

### 2.3 Reinforcement Learning from Verification Feedback

To continuously improve the model's tactic generation capabilities, we implement a reinforcement learning loop that leverages the verification feedback:

1. **Reward Function**: We define a reward function based on the verification outcome:

   $$\text{Reward}(t, c) = \begin{cases}
   +10 & \text{if } R(t, c) = (\text{SUCCESS}, \cdot) \\
   +5 \cdot (1 - \frac{|g'|}{|g|+1}) & \text{if } R(t, c) = (\text{PARTIAL}, \cdot, g') \\
   -1 & \text{if } R(t, c) = (\text{FAILURE}, \cdot)
   \end{cases}$$

2. **Policy Gradient Update**: We update the model parameters using the REINFORCE algorithm:

   $$\nabla_\theta \mathcal{J}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t \sim P_\theta(\cdot|c)}[\text{Reward}(t, c) \cdot \nabla_\theta \log P_\theta(t|c)]$$

   In practice, we approximate this gradient using samples:

   $$\nabla_\theta \mathcal{J}(\theta) \approx \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Reward}(t_i, c) \cdot \nabla_\theta \log P_\theta(t_i|c)$$

3. **Counter-Example Generation**: For failed tactics, we generate explanations of why they failed, which are included in the training data:

   $$D_{\text{new}} = D \cup \{(c, t_i, \text{Reward}(t_i, c), \text{Explain}(R(t_i, c))) \text{ for } t_i \in T_{\text{cand}}\}$$

   where Explain converts the error message or partial proof state into a natural language explanation.

4. **Periodic Model Retraining**: We retrain the model periodically using both the original training data and the newly accumulated examples:

   $$\theta_{\text{new}} = \arg\min_\theta \left[ -\sum_{(c, t) \in D_{\text{orig}}} \log P_\theta(t|c) - \lambda \sum_{(c, t, r, e) \in D_{\text{new}}} r \cdot \log P_\theta(t|c) \right]$$

   where $\lambda$ is a weighting factor that balances the original supervised learning with the reinforcement signal.

### 2.4 Experimental Design and Evaluation

To evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-TAC, we will conduct a comprehensive set of experiments across multiple theorem proving benchmarks:

1. **Datasets**: We will use the following datasets for evaluation:
   - Coq mathcomp library (mathematical components)
   - Coq stdlib (standard library)
   - Lean mathlib (standard library for mathematics)
   - CompCert verified compiler proofs (subset)

2. **Baselines**: We will compare LLM-TAC against the following baselines:
   - Manual proof development (human baseline)
   - Auto-tactics (e.g., `auto`, `tauto`, `crush` in Coq)
   - LeanDojo (Yang et al., 2023)
   - LLMSTEP (Welleck & Saha, 2023)
   - COPRA (Thakur et al., 2023)

3. **Metrics**: We will evaluate performance using the following metrics:
   - **Tactic Success Rate (TSR)**: The percentage of generated tactics that successfully advance the proof state
   - **Proof Completion Rate (PCR)**: The percentage of theorems completely proved by the system
   - **Proof Length Ratio (PLR)**: The ratio of the number of tactics in system-generated proofs to those in human-written proofs
   - **Time to Proof (TTP)**: The average time required to complete a proof
   - **Human Effort Reduction (HER)**: A measure of the reduction in manual interaction required, defined as:
     $$\text{HER} = 1 - \frac{\text{Number of human interventions with LLM-TAC}}{\text{Number of tactics in manual proof}}$$

4. **Ablation Studies**: We will conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component:
   - Contextual encoding without retrieval augmentation
   - Tactic generation without verification feedback
   - Reinforcement learning with different reward functions

5. **User Study**: We will conduct a user study with 20 participants of varying expertise levels in theorem proving, measuring:
   - Time to complete proof tasks with and without LLM-TAC
   - User satisfaction and perceived utility (Likert scale)
   - Learning curve effects over multiple sessions

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### 3.1 Expected Outcomes

We anticipate several concrete outcomes from this research:

1. **Reduction in Manual Tactic Writing**: We expect LLM-TAC to achieve a 50% reduction in manual tactic writing on standard Coq benchmarks (mathcomp, stdlib) compared to current practices. This means that for proofs that typically require 100 manually written tactics, users would only need to write approximately 50 tactics, with LLM-TAC successfully generating the rest.

2. **Improvement in Proof Development Efficiency**: We expect a 40-60% reduction in proof development time across our benchmark datasets, enabling faster formalization of mathematical theories and verified software.

3. **Enhanced Accessibility of ITPs**: By lowering the expertise barrier for effective use of interactive theorem provers, we anticipate LLM-TAC will make formal methods more accessible to domain experts without extensive theorem proving experience.

4. **Technical Artifacts**: The research will produce:
   - A fine-tuned language model specifically optimized for tactic generation
   - An integration library connecting the model to Coq and Lean
   - A dataset of proof states, tactic attempts, and verification outcomes
   - Open-source implementation of the entire LLM-TAC framework

5. **Methodological Insights**: We expect to gain insights into:
   - Optimal representations of formal proof contexts for language models
   - Effective reward structures for reinforcement learning in theorem proving
   - The complementary strengths of probabilistic and formal methods

### 3.2 Broader Impact

The potential impact of this research extends beyond the immediate technical contributions:

1. **Democratization of Formal Methods**: By reducing the specialized knowledge required for effective theorem proving, LLM-TAC can help democratize formal methods, making them accessible to a broader range of researchers and developers.

2. **Acceleration of Verified Software Development**: The efficiency gains provided by LLM-TAC could significantly accelerate the development of formally verified software, contributing to improved software reliability in critical systems.

3. **Bridging AI and Formal Methods**: This work represents a significant step in bridging the traditionally separate fields of artificial intelligence and formal verification, demonstrating how probabilistic methods can enhance rather than replace formal reasoning.

4. **Educational Applications**: The interactive nature of LLM-TAC, combined with its ability to explain tactic choices, makes it a potentially valuable educational tool for teaching formal methods and theorem proving.

5. **New Research Directions**: The framework established by LLM-TAC opens up new research directions in applying reinforcement learning to formal reasoning tasks and in developing hybrid systems that combine the strengths of neural and symbolic approaches.

By fusing probabilistic generation with formal verification checks, LLM-TAC has the potential to fundamentally transform how researchers and developers interact with theorem provers, paving the way for more widespread adoption of formal methods across various domains of computer science and mathematics.
