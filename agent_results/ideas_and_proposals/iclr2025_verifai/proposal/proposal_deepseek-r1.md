LLM-Guided Tactic Autogeneration for Interactive Theorem Provers: Bridging Probabilistic AI with Formal Verification

**2. Introduction**  

**2.1 Background**  
Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) such as Coq, Lean, and Isabelle are foundational tools for formalizing mathematics and verifying software correctness. A core challenge in ITP is *tactic engineering*: manually writing sequences of proof commands (*tactics*) to decompose goals into provable subgoals. This process demands deep expertise, creating bottlenecks in scaling formal methods to large projects. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), offer promising avenues for automating tactic generation. However, LLMs alone lack guarantees of correctness, risking invalid proofs and unreliable outputs.  

**2.2 Research Objectives**  
This research aims to develop **LLM-TAC**, a framework that integrates fine-tuned LLMs with formal verification to automate tactic generation while ensuring correctness. Specifically, we address:  
1. **Context-Aware Tactic Synthesis**: Encoding dynamic proof states and project-specific libraries to generate relevant tactics.  
2. **Formal Verification as Feedback**: Using theorem provers to validate candidate tactics and iteratively refine the LLM via reinforcement learning.  
3. **Scalability and Generalization**: Ensuring robustness across mathematical domains and large-scale codebases.  

**2.3 Significance**  
By combining probabilistic generative models with formal verification, LLM-TAC seeks to reduce the manual effort of theorem proving while maintaining reliability. Successful execution would:  
- Accelerate formal methods adoption in academia and industry.  
- Establish best practices for integrating LLMs with verification tools.  
- Contribute open-source models, datasets, and benchmarks to the AI-for-formal-methods community.

**3. Methodology**  

**3.1 Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
**Benchmark Datasets**:  
- **Standard Libraries**: Curate proof states from Coq’s Mathematical Components (mathcomp) and Lean’s stdlib.  
- **User Interaction Logs**: Capture dynamic proof state sequences from experienced users via the [LeanDojo](https://leandojo.org/) toolkit.  

**Preprocessing Steps**:  
1. **State Serialization**: Represent proof states as structured strings with hypotheses, goals, and dependencies (e.g., `Γ ⊢ ∀x, P(x) → Q(x)`).  
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Encoding**: Use a transformer model with a retrieval component to index and retrieve relevant premises and lemmas from project libraries.  

**3.2 Algorithm Design**  
**LLM-TAC Architecture**  

**Stage 1: Contextual Encoding**  
For a proof state *s*, encode its components into a fixed-length vector using a hybrid model:  
1. **Textual Features**: A transformer encoder processes hypotheses, goals, and retrieved lemmas.  
2. **Structural Features**: Graph neural networks capture dependencies between hypotheses and goals.  

The combined representation is:  
$$
\mathbf{h}_s = \text{Transformer}(\text{concat}(\mathbf{h}_{\text{text}}, \mathbf{h}_{\text{graph}}))
$$  

**Stage 2: Tactic Generation & Verification**  
1. **Candidate Generation**: A decoder-only LLM (e.g., CodeLlama-13B) generates *k* candidate tactic sequences via beam search:  
   $$
   T = \{t_1, t_2, ..., t_k\} \sim P_\theta(t \mid \mathbf{h}_s)
   $$  
   To enforce syntactical validity, constrain token sampling to Lean/Coq tactic vocabulary.  
2. **Formal Verification**: Execute each tactic *t_i* in the theorem prover.  
   - **Success**: If *t_i* closes the subgoal, log *(s, t_i)* as positive training data.  
   - **Failure**: If *t_i* fails, collect the prover’s error message and backtracked state as counterexamples.  

**Stage 3: Reinforcement Learning (RL) Loop**  
Train the LLM using a hybrid objective:  
1. **Behavioral Cloning**: Minimize cross-entropy loss on successful tactic pairs.  
2. **Reinforcement Learning**: Maximize expected reward via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), where the reward *r* is:  
   $$
   r(t_i) = \begin{cases} 
   1 & \text{if } t_i \text{ solves the subgoal} \\
   -0.1 & \text{if } t_i \text{ fails syntactically} \\
   -0.5 & \text{if } t_i \text{ fails semantically} 
   \end{cases}
   $$  
   Semantic failures (e.g., unresolved metavariables) are penalized more heavily than syntax errors.  

**3.3 Experimental Design**  

**Baselines**: Compare against:  
- **ReProver**: A retrieval-augmented LLM for Lean [1].  
- **LLMSTEP**: In-IDE tactic suggestions for Lean [2].  
- **COPRA**: Backtracking-based GPT-4 agent [3].  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
1. **Success Rate**: Percentage of subgoals closed automatically.  
2. **Human Effort Reduction**: Time saved by users in manual tactic writing (measured via user studies).  
3. **Proof Length**: Average number of tactics required to close a goal (lower = better).  
4. **Generalization**: Accuracy on unseen domains (e.g., switching from algebra to topology).  

**Validation Protocol**:  
- **Coq Benchmarks**: Evaluate on 500 lemmas from mathcomp and 300 from stdlib.  
- **User Study**: Recruit 10 Coq developers to complete 20 proofs with/without LLM-TAC, comparing time and correctness.  

**3.4 Implementation Details**  
- **Model**: Initialize with CodeLlama-13B, fine-tuned on Coq tactics.  
- **Training**: 4× A100 GPUs, AdamW optimizer ($\beta_1=0.9$, $\beta_2=0.95$), learning rate $10^{-5}$.  
- **Prover Integration**: Use LeanDojo’s Python API for tactic execution and feedback.
