## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **HyperPrompt: Dynamic Hyperparameter Adaptation in Reinforcement Learning via LLM-Based Meta-Learning**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex sequential decision-making problems, achieving superhuman performance in games (Mnih et al., 2015; Silver et al., 2017), advancing robotic control (Levine et al., 2016), optimizing chemical processes, and even contributing to nuclear fusion control (Degrave et al., 2022). Despite these successes, the practical application of RL often remains challenging. A significant barrier is the extreme sensitivity of RL algorithms to their hyperparameter settings (Henderson et al., 2018; Eimer et al., 2023). Hyperparameters such as learning rates, discount factors ($\gamma$), entropy coefficients, and buffer sizes critically influence learning stability, convergence speed, and final performance. Finding optimal hyperparameter configurations typically involves extensive manual tuning or computationally expensive automated searches, often specific to a particular task or environment. This process is resource-intensive and hinders the broader adoption of RL, especially for novel problems where prior knowledge is limited.

Recent work underscores the complexity of this challenge. Mohan et al. (2023) provided empirical evidence that hyperparameter landscapes in RL are not static but evolve dynamically throughout the training process. An optimal configuration at the beginning of training may become suboptimal later, suggesting that fixed hyperparameter settings are inherently limited. This necessitates methods capable of *dynamic* hyperparameter adaptation.

The field of Automated Reinforcement Learning (AutoRL) aims to address these challenges by automating various aspects of the RL pipeline, including hyperparameter optimization (HPO). Existing approaches, often drawing from AutoML techniques like Bayesian optimization or evolutionary algorithms (Eimer et al., 2023), typically perform HPO offline before the main training run or intermittently, lacking the fine-grained, real-time adaptability needed to respond to dynamic training conditions. While benchmarks like ARLBench (Becktepe et al., 2024) facilitate the evaluation of HPO methods, the core challenge of efficient, online adaptation remains largely open.

Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of complex reasoning, pattern recognition, and in-context learning across diverse domains (Brown et al., 2020). Their application is expanding into sequential decision-making, including functioning as agents or controllers (e.g., LLM agents tackling RL tasks). Furthermore, works like OptFormer (Chen et al., 2022) have demonstrated the potential of sequence models (Transformers, the basis of many LLMs) for AutoML tasks, framing optimization as a sequence modeling problem. This suggests LLMs could potentially learn complex patterns within RL training dynamics and guide hyperparameter adjustments. Inspired by recent work on LLM meta-thinking (Wan et al., 2025), we hypothesize that LLMs can serve as meta-controllers, learning to adapt RL hyperparameters based on observed training progress.

**2.2 Research Problem & Idea**
The core problem addressed by this research is the manual and static nature of hyperparameter tuning in RL, which limits robustness and necessitates costly optimization procedures. We propose **HyperPrompt**, a novel framework that leverages pretrained LLMs to perform *dynamic, online hyperparameter adaptation* during RL training. The central idea is to treat the LLM as a meta-learner that observes the ongoing RL process (e.g., recent trajectories, performance metrics) and outputs adjusted hyperparameter values in real-time. This transforms hyperparameter tuning from a static, offline search into a dynamic, context-aware policy learned by the LLM, effectively integrating ideas from Meta-RL, AutoML, and LLM capabilities.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:
1.  **Develop the HyperPrompt Framework:** Design and implement a system where an LLM receives encoded information about the RL agent's state and performance, and outputs hyperparameter adjustments. This includes defining the prompt structure, selecting and finetuning the LLM, and integrating it seamlessly into the RL training loop.
2.  **Meta-Train the LLM Controller:** Curate a diverse dataset of RL training runs across various environments, algorithms, and initial hyperparameter settings. Use this dataset to finetune the LLM to predict beneficial hyperparameter updates based on observed training dynamics.
3.  **Evaluate HyperPrompt's Effectiveness:** Empirically assess the performance of HyperPrompt against relevant baselines (fixed hyperparameters, standard HPO techniques) on challenging benchmark environments, particularly those requiring generalization (e.g., procedurally generated environments). Key evaluation criteria include sample efficiency, final agent performance, and adaptation capability.
4.  **Analyze the Adaptation Mechanism:** Investigate the behavior of the LLM controller. How do the suggested hyperparameters change over time? How sensitive is the system to different prompt designs or LLM architectures? Does the LLM learn meaningful adaptation strategies?

**2.4 Significance**
This research holds significant potential for advancing the field of AutoRL and making RL more practical and accessible:
*   **Addressing RL Brittleness:** By dynamically adapting hyperparameters, HyperPrompt aims to improve the robustness of RL agents to variations in tasks and environments.
*   **Reducing Manual Effort:** Automating the dynamic tuning process significantly lowers the barrier to entry for applying RL, reducing the need for expert knowledge and extensive manual experimentation.
*   **Improving Sample Efficiency:** Context-aware hyperparameter adjustments could lead to faster convergence and better final performance, making RL more feasible for computationally constrained applications.
*   **Bridging Communities:** This work directly addresses the goals of the AutoRL workshop by integrating concepts from RL, Meta-Learning, AutoML, and LLMs, fostering cross-pollination of ideas.
*   **Enabling Adaptive Agents:** The framework contributes to the development of more autonomous agents capable of adapting their learning strategy online.
*   **Democratizing RL:** By simplifying a critical aspect of RL application, HyperPrompt could broaden the user base and accelerate RL adoption in new scientific and industrial domains.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework: HyperPrompt**
The HyperPrompt framework consists of two main components: an RL agent learning within an environment and an LLM-based meta-controller adapting the RL agent's hyperparameters. The interaction proceeds in loops: the RL agent interacts with the environment for a fixed number of steps or episodes ($K$). Data collected during this interval (trajectories, performance metrics) is processed and formatted into a prompt for the LLM. The LLM generates updated hyperparameter values, which are then applied to the RL agent for the next learning interval.

**3.2 Data Collection for Meta-Training**
To train the LLM meta-controller, we require a large dataset encompassing diverse RL scenarios. This dataset will be generated by running multiple RL training processes across:
*   **Environments:** A variety of environments will be used, ranging from classic control (e.g., CartPole, Pendulum) and MuJoCo continuous control tasks (e.g., Walker2d, Hopper) for initial testing, to more complex and diverse procedurally generated environments like Procgen Benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2020) and NetHack Learning Environment (KÃ¼ttler et al., 2020) to evaluate generalization.
*   **RL Algorithms:** We will include data from widely used RL algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) for policy gradient methods and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) (Mnih et al., 2015) or Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) (Haarnoja et al., 2018) for value-based/actor-critic methods.
*   **Hyperparameter Settings:** Each training run will use different initial hyperparameter configurations, potentially sampled using techniques like Latin Hypercube Sampling, to cover a broad range of behaviors.

During these runs, we will log:
*   **Trajectories:** Sequences of (state $s_t$, action $a_t$, reward $r_t$, next state $s_{t+1}$) or relevant summaries.
*   **Performance Metrics:** Episodic returns, success rates, loss values (actor/critic), exploration metrics (e.g., entropy).
*   **Hyperparameter History:** The set of hyperparameters used during each interval.
*   **Environment Information:** Metadata about the specific task instance, if available (e.g., seed for procedural generation).

**3.3 Prompt Engineering and Encoding**
The core of HyperPrompt lies in effectively communicating the state of the RL process to the LLM. The prompt, $P_t$, provided to the LLM at adaptation step $t$, will be structured text containing information from the last interval ($t-1$ to $t$):
*   **Recent Trajectory Snippets:** Summaries or embeddings of recent state-action-reward sequences. This could involve statistical summaries (e.g., average reward, state visitation entropy) or potentially learned representations via an auxiliary model.
*   **Performance Summary:** Key metrics like average return, standard deviation of returns, loss trends, progress towards task completion over the last $K$ steps/episodes.
*   **Current Hyperparameters:** The values of the hyperparameters $\theta_{t-1}$ used during the last interval.
*   **Training Progress:** Information like the total number of steps/episodes elapsed.
*   **Environment Context (Optional):** A textual description or key parameters of the current environment/task variation.

The prompt design will be crucial and subject to experimentation. We aim for a balance between providing sufficient context and keeping the prompt concise for efficient LLM processing.

**3.4 LLM Selection and Finetuning**
*   **Model Selection:** We will start with moderately sized pretrained LLMs (e.g., GPT-Neo, Llama 2 7B, or potentially smaller, more efficient models like DistilBERT variants adapted for sequence generation if latency is critical) known for strong in-context learning and reasoning capabilities. The choice will depend on performance vs. computational cost trade-offs.
*   **Finetuning Objective:** The LLM will be finetuned in a supervised manner. The input is the prompt $P_t$ describing the RL state up to adaptation step $t$. The target output is a set of "improved" hyperparameter values $\theta_t^*$. Determining $\theta_t^*$ for the training data is non-trivial. We propose two approaches:
    1.  **Offline Oracle:** Use computationally expensive offline HPO (e.g., Bayesian Optimization, population-based training) on short segments of the training data trajectories to identify locally optimal hyperparameter adjustments. These serve as target outputs for the LLM.
    2.  **Heuristic/Rule-Based Targets:** Define heuristics based on observed performance. For example, if performance stagnates, slightly increase exploration parameters or adjust learning rates. These heuristics provide weaker but more readily available training signals.
    We will likely experiment with a combination or curriculum approach. The LLM's task is to predict these target hyperparameter values (or changes $\Delta \theta_t = \theta_t^* - \theta_{t-1}$) given the prompt.
*   **Training Procedure:** Standard finetuning techniques for LLMs will be employed, minimizing a cross-entropy loss (for discrete parameters or discretized continuous ones) or mean squared error loss (for continuous parameters) between the LLM's predicted hyperparameters and the target values.

**3.5 Dynamic Adaptation Mechanism**
During the deployment phase (actual RL training with HyperPrompt):
1.  Initialize the RL agent with default or randomly sampled hyperparameters $\theta_0$.
2.  For adaptation step $t = 1, 2, ...$:
    a.  Train the RL agent using hyperparameters $\theta_{t-1}$ for $K$ environment steps or episodes.
    b.  Collect relevant trajectory data and performance metrics during this interval.
    c.  Encode this information into the prompt $P_t$.
    d.  Query the finetuned LLM: $\hat{\theta}_t = \pi_{LLM}(P_t)$.
    e.  Update the RL agent's hyperparameters: $\theta_t \leftarrow \hat{\theta}_t$. Handle constraints (e.g., learning rates must be positive). Implement safeguards against drastic changes if necessary.
    f.  Continue RL training with the new hyperparameters $\theta_t$.

The adaptation frequency (determined by $K$) is a hyperparameter of HyperPrompt itself and will be investigated.

**3.6 Mathematical Formulation (Conceptual)**
We can frame the HyperPrompt process within a meta-learning context. The LLM acts as a meta-policy $\pi_{LLM}$ operating in a partially observable state space. The meta-state $s_t^{meta}$ corresponds to the information encoded in the prompt $P_t$, representing a summary of the underlying RL process's recent history. The meta-action $a_t^{meta}$ is the set of hyperparameters $\theta_t$ chosen by the LLM.
$$ a_t^{meta} = \theta_t = \pi_{LLM}(s_t^{meta}) = \pi_{LLM}(f_{encode}(\text{History}_{t-K:t})) $$
where $f_{encode}$ is the function that processes the recent history (trajectories, metrics, previous hyperparameters) into the structured prompt $P_t$. The objective during meta-training is to learn $\pi_{LLM}$ such that the chosen hyperparameters $\theta_t$ maximize the future performance of the underlying RL agent. This is approximated via the supervised finetuning described earlier.

**3.7 Experimental Design**
*   **Environments:**
    *   **Core Benchmarks:** Procgen Benchmark (multiple games like CoinRun, BigFish, Jumper) will be central due to its focus on generalization across procedurally generated levels. NetHack Learning Environment will provide a complex, stochastic, and long-horizon challenge.
    *   **Simpler Environments:** Classic control (CartPole, Acrobot) and MuJoCo tasks (Hopper, Walker2d) will be used for ablation studies and initial validation.
*   **RL Algorithms:** PPO will be the primary algorithm due to its prevalence and robustness. We will also test with SAC or DQN to assess HyperPrompt's applicability across different algorithm families.
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **Fixed Default Hyperparameters:** Standard, commonly used hyperparameters for each algorithm/environment pair.
    2.  **Fixed Tuned Hyperparameters:** Hyperparameters obtained via extensive offline tuning using a standard HPO method (e.g., Optuna with TPE sampler) on a representative set of training environments/levels. This represents a strong, static baseline.
    3.  **Standard HPO:** Apply online or periodic HPO methods like Population-Based Training (PBT) (Jaderberg et al., 2017) or simple grid/random search performed intermittently.
    4.  **Simple Adaptive Schedules:** Predefined learning rate decay schedules or simple rule-based adaptation (e.g., based on loss plateaus).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Primary:**
        *   **Sample Efficiency:** Learning curves showing average return (or success rate) vs. environment steps. We will measure the area under the learning curve (AUC) and steps required to reach specific performance thresholds.
        *   **Final Performance:** Average return over the last portion of training episodes/steps, evaluated across multiple seeds.
        *   **Generalization:** Performance on unseen levels/variations of the procedural environments after training.
    *   **Secondary:**
        *   **Computational Overhead:** Wall-clock time for training, including the time spent on LLM inference and prompt preparation.
        *   **Hyperparameter Dynamics:** Analysis of the hyperparameter trajectories produced by HyperPrompt. Are they stable? Do they converge? Do they show meaningful adaptation patterns?
        *   **Robustness:** Performance variance across different random seeds.
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    *   Impact of prompt components (removing trajectory info, performance info, etc.).
    *   Effect of LLM size and architecture.
    *   Sensitivity to the adaptation frequency $K$.
    *   Comparison of different meta-training target generation methods (offline oracle vs. heuristics).
*   **Benchmarking Framework:** We will leverage frameworks like ARLBench (Becktepe et al., 2024) where possible to standardize evaluation and potentially reduce computational cost for baseline comparisons.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**
*   **Demonstration of Feasibility:** We expect to successfully implement the HyperPrompt framework, showing that an LLM can be finetuned to perform plausible dynamic hyperparameter adjustments during RL training.
*   **Improved Performance:** We anticipate that HyperPrompt will outperform static hyperparameter baselines (default and tuned) in terms of sample efficiency and/or final performance, especially in complex and non-stationary environments like Procgen and NetHack where adaptability is crucial.
*   **Competitive Adaptation:** HyperPrompt is expected to be competitive with, or potentially exceed the performance of, existing online adaptation methods like PBT, potentially with different trade-offs regarding computational overhead and implementation complexity.
*   **Generalization Capability:** The use of diverse meta-training data and evaluation on procedural benchmarks should demonstrate HyperPrompt's ability to generalize its adaptation strategy to unseen task variations.
*   **Insights into Dynamic HPO:** Analysis of the LLM's behavior will provide insights into effective dynamic hyperparameter scheduling strategies in RL, potentially revealing patterns that are difficult for humans to discover.
*   **Quantifiable Benefits:** We aim to quantify the reduction in tuning effort (compared to manual or extensive offline HPO) and the gains in sample efficiency (e.g., "HyperPrompt achieves target performance X% faster").

**4.2 Potential Challenges and Mitigation**
*   **Computational Cost:** LLM inference can be computationally expensive. Mitigation: Experiment with smaller LLMs, explore model distillation, optimize prompt length, adjust adaptation frequency $K$.
*   **Meta-Training Data:** Generating high-quality, diverse meta-training data is demanding. Mitigation: Utilize efficient simulation environments, leverage existing RL run databases if available, potentially use synthetic data generation techniques. Defining good target hyperparameters for supervision is hard. Mitigation: Start with heuristics, explore reinforcement-based meta-training for the LLM itself as future work.
*   **Prompt Sensitivity:** LLM outputs can be sensitive to prompt phrasing. Mitigation: Rigorous experimentation with prompt structures, use of structured input/output formats (e.g., JSON), potentially employ techniques for robust prompting.
*   **Stability:** Rapid or inappropriate hyperparameter changes could destabilize RL training. Mitigation: Implement safeguards (e.g., clipping changes, smoothing updates), potentially add stability metrics to the prompt.

**4.3 Impact**
The successful development of HyperPrompt would represent a significant step forward in Automated Reinforcement Learning. By automating dynamic hyperparameter control using the powerful pattern-matching and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, this research would:
*   **Enhance RL Practicality:** Make state-of-the-art RL algorithms easier to deploy effectively by reducing the hyperparameter tuning burden.
*   **Improve Agent Adaptability:** Contribute to building RL agents that can automatically adjust their learning process in response to changing dynamics or novel situations.
*   **Advance AutoRL Research:** Provide a new paradigm for AutoRL, leveraging LLMs as meta-controllers, opening avenues for automating other aspects of the RL pipeline (e.g., architecture search, reward shaping).
*   **Foster Cross-Disciplinary Innovation:** Strengthen the link between the LLM, RL, Meta-Learning, and AutoML communities, directly contributing to the goals of the workshop by demonstrating a novel synthesis of ideas from these fields.
*   **Democratize Access to RL:** Ultimately, lower the expertise and computational threshold required for successful RL application, enabling wider use in science and industry.

This research promises not only a practical tool for improving RL performance but also a deeper understanding of the interplay between learning dynamics, hyperparameter settings, and high-level reasoning, as embodied by the LLM meta-controller.
