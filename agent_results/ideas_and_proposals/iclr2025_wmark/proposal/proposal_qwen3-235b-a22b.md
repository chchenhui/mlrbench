# Title  
**Dynamic Adversarial Training for Robust Generative AI Watermarking**

---

# Introduction  

## Background  
Generative AI models have revolutionized content creation, enabling high-quality text, images, and multimedia generation at scale. However, this proliferation raises critical concerns about content authenticity, ownership, and misuse. Watermarking—a technique to embed imperceptible identifiers into AI-generated outputs—has emerged as a necessity to address these challenges. Effective watermarks must remain detectable even when subjected to adversarial manipulations, such as cropping, noise injection, or paraphrasing, which could render static watermarks ineffective.  

Current watermarking methods, including those proposed in InvisMark [1] and REMARK-LLM [4], rely on fixed embedding strategies that lack adaptability to evolving threats. While advances in certified robustness [6] and knowledge injection [5] show promise, these approaches often assume prior knowledge of attack types or require retraining, limiting scalability. Adversarial training—a technique proven in robust machine learning [8]—offers a pathway to address this gap by simulating realistic attack scenarios during training.  

## Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a **dynamic adversarial training framework** for watermarking AI-generated content (images and text). The objectives are:  
1. To train a watermark embedder capable of surviving diverse, unknown attacks by co-evolving with adversarial perturbation models.  
2. To optimize the balance between imperceptibility (high content quality) and robustness against distributional shifts caused by attacks.  
3. To validate the framework’s generalization to unseen attacks and establish benchmarks for standardized evaluation.  

## Significance  
This work directly addresses critical challenges in generative AI security:  
- **Adversarial Robustness**: By simulating a zero-sum game between embedders and attackers, the framework proactively hardens watermarks against novel exploit strategies.  
- **Scalability**: The architecture avoids reliance on model retraining, enabling deployment in large-scale generative AI pipelines.  
- **Policy Alignment**: Robust watermarks enable verifiable provenance, supporting regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI Act) and ethical content distribution.

# Methodology  

## Model Architecture and Training Framework  

We propose a co-training framework involving three components:  
1. **Watermark Embedder (Generator)**: A neural network $G$ that maps an input content $x$ and watermark message $w$ to a watermarked output $x_w = G(x, w)$.  
2. **Adversarial Attackers**: A suite of models $A = \{A_1, A_2, ..., A_k\}$ that simulate attacks to distort $x_w$, producing $x_{w,a} = A_i(x_w)$.  
3. **Detector**: A trained model $D$ that predicts $w$ from $x_{w,a}$.  

The framework operates in a mini-max adversarial loop (see [8]):  
- $A$ seeks to minimize $D$’s accuracy by distorting $x_w$ (i.e., reducing $\log P_D(w|x_{w,a})$).  
- $G$ seeks to maximize robust detection accuracy while minimizing perceptual distortion between $x$ and $x_w$.  

### Mathematical Formulation  
The adversarial loss function balances detection robustness ($\mathcal{L}_{robust}$) and content fidelity ($\mathcal{L}_{distort}$):  
$$
\min_{G} \max_{A} \left[ \mathbb{E}_{x,w,A} \left[ -\log P_D(w|x_{w,a}) \right] + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{D}(x, x_w) \right],
$$  
where $\mathcal{D}(\cdot)$ measures perceptual distortion (e.g., SSIM for images, cosine distance for embeddings), and $\lambda$ controls trade-off severity.  

For multi-modal attacks (images/text), we design architectures tailored to domain-specific perturbations:  
- **Image Watermarking**:  
  - $G$ uses a U-Net variant with frequency-domain losses [7].  
  - $A$ includes noise injection ($\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$), content-aware inpainting, and affine transformations.  
  - $\mathcal{D} = \text{SSIM} + \alpha \cdot \text{PSNR} + \beta \cdot \text{CLIP}_{\text{sim}}$ for fidelity.  
- **Text Watermarking**:  
  - $G$ modifies token distributions via gradient-based contrastive learning [10].  
  - $A$ implements synonym replacement, insertion/deletion, and paraphrasing.  
  - $\mathcal{D} = \text{BLEU} + \text{CLIP}_{\text{sim}}$ to preserve semantics.  

## Data Collection and Modalities  
- **Image Data**: High-resolution images from ImageNet [9] (256×256 resolution) for training, augmented with Gaussian noise and cropping.  
- **Text Data**: Wikipedia and Common Crawl subsets (filtered for quality), with 256-bit watermark payloads.  
- **Attack Synthesis**: Attacks are dynamically generated during training using PyTorch-augmentations and TextAttack libraries.  

## Evaluation Metrics  
### Robustness  
- **Detection Accuracy (Acc_det)**: Probability that $D$ correctly decodes $w$ under attacks.  
- **Bit Accuracy (Acc_bit)**: In bitwise decoding, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}(w_i = \hat{w}_i)$ for $n$-bit payloads.  

### Imperceptibility  
- **Image Quality**: SSIM, PSNR (target: SSIM ≥ 0.99, PSNR ≥ 50 dB [1]).  
- **Text Fluency**: BERTScore, perplexity, and human evaluation (Amazon Mechanical Turk).  

### Generalization  
- **Unseen Attacks**: Measure Acc_det against distortions (e.g., JPEG compression, adversarial word obfuscation) not seen during training.  
- **Ablation Studies**: Compare performance with and without specific adversaries in $A$.  

## Experimental Design  
1. **Baselines**:  
   - InvisMark [1], REMARK-LLM [4], and SpreadThemApart [3] for imperceptibility vs. robustness trade-off.  
   - ProvableRobustText [2] and CertifiablyRobustImage [6] for certified guarantees.  

2. **Training Protocol**:  
   - Use Wasserstein GAN optimizer with gradient penalty (WGP) for stable adversarial convergence.  
   - Hyperparameters ($\lambda, \alpha, \beta$) are grid-searched over validation sets.  

3. **Benchmarking**:  
   - **Image**: Test on W-Bench [7] and ImageNet-C corruption benchmarks.  
   - **Text**: Evaluate on DA-Eval [10] paraphrase datasets and synthetic adversarial prompts.  

4. **Statistical Validation**:  
   - 5-fold cross-validation with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to assess detection robustness.

3. **Generalization to Unseen Attacks**: Deployment of attackers $A$ trained on synthetic distortions will reduce susceptibility to obfuscation tools unseen during training (e.g., adversarial synonym APIs).
