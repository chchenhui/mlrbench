1. Title: **Dynamic Adversarial Training for Robust Generative AI Watermarking**  

2. Motivation:  
Generative AI watermarks face significant risks from attackers aiming to remove or obscure them. Current watermarking methods often rely on static embedding techniques, making them vulnerable to reverse-engineering or distortion under adversarial attacks. This undermines confidence in content provenance verification, particularly in industries like media, publishing, and intellectual property protection. Developing watermarks that are both imperceptible and resilient to evolving attack strategies is critical for ensuring trust in AI-generated content.  

3. Main Idea:  
We propose a dynamic adversarial training framework to enhance watermark robustness. The method involves co-training a watermark embedder (generator) and a suite of adversarial attack models. The generator learns to embed watermarks that remain detectable even under diverse attacks (e.g., cropping, noise injection, or inpainting), while the adversaries iteratively identify and exploit weaknesses. This zero-sum game ensures the watermark adapts to increasingly sophisticated threats without compromising content quality. We will evaluate the system using standardized benchmarks, measuring robustness via detection accuracy under attack and content fidelity via perceptual metrics (e.g., SSIM, CLIP similarity). Byiteratively simulating adversarial playbooks during training, this approach promises watermarks that generalizes to unseen attacks, aligning with industry demands for scalable, secure AI-generated content authentication.
