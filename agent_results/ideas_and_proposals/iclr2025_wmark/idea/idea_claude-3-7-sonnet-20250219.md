# Advanced Multimodal Watermarking Framework for Generative AI

## Motivation
As generative AI produces increasingly realistic content across modalities (text, images, audio, video), traditional watermarking approaches face significant challenges in robustness, imperceptibility, and cross-modal applications. Current watermarking techniques are typically siloed within specific modalities and struggle with maintaining integrity against adversarial attacks. With the rise of multimodal generative systems, we need watermarking solutions that work harmoniously across different content types while providing verifiable attribution in real-world scenarios.

## Main Idea
We propose developing a unified multimodal watermarking framework that embeds cryptographically secure signatures across different generative outputs while maintaining coherence when content transforms between modalities. The approach uses a hierarchical embedding strategy: (1) a base-layer watermark using content-adaptive transformations that are resistant to common manipulations, (2) a cross-modal bridge layer that preserves watermark detection when content shifts between modalities (e.g., text-to-image or image-to-video), and (3) a verification protocol that allows partial watermark recovery even after significant modifications. Our system would implement adaptive watermarking strength based on content sensitivity and incorporate federated verification mechanisms that don't require exposing the original watermarking keys. This framework would provide standardized APIs for industry adoption while enabling tiered verification levels appropriate for different regulatory and ethical requirements.
