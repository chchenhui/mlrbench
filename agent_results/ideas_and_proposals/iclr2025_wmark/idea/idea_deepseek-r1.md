**Title:** Cryptographically Secure Adversarial-Resistant Watermarking for Generative AI  

**Motivation:** Current watermarking techniques for generative AI are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks, compromising content authenticity and enabling misuse (e.g., deepfakes, plagiarism). Robust, tamper-proof watermarks are critical to ensure trust in AI-generated content across industries like media, legal, and healthcare.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a hybrid framework combining neural networks with cryptographic primitives. First, a neural network embeds an imperceptible watermark into AI-generated content (images, text). Second, a cryptographic layer appends a secure, non-invertible hash-based signature derived from the content and a private key. This dual-layer approach ensures adversarial resistance: even if the watermark is partially altered, the cryptographic signature enables verification. The method will be evaluated against state-of-the-art attacks (e.g., noise injection, model fine-tuning) using a novel benchmark suite measuring robustness, false positive rates, and computational overhead. Expected outcomes include a provably secure framework that outperforms existing methods in adversarial settings, with open-source tools for industry adoption. Impact: Enhanced trust in GenAI outputs, compliance with emerging regulations, and reduced risks of content manipulation.
