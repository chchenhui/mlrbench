**Title:** Adaptive Asynchronous Forward-Forward Learning for Streaming Edge Applications

**Motivation:** Standard backpropagation is unsuitable for real-time learning on resource-constrained edge devices analyzing streaming data due to its high latency and memory requirements. Forward-forward learning offers a local alternative but needs adaptation for asynchronous, heterogeneous edge environments.

**Main Idea:** We propose an Adaptive Asynchronous Forward-Forward (AAFF) algorithm for edge devices. Each device processes local data streams and trains local model segments using the forward-forward approach with local goodness functions. Crucially, updates happen asynchronously based on data arrival and device availability. To manage heterogeneity and prevent staleness, devices adaptively weight the influence of updates from neighbouring segments (potentially on other devices) based on update recency and estimated reliability metrics derived from local performance monitoring. This allows continuous, low-latency adaptation on-device, enabling rapid response to changing data streams in applications like real-time video analytics or sensor fusion, without requiring global synchronization.
