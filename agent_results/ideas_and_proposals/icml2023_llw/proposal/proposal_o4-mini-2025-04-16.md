Title  
Edge-Localized Asynchronous Learning with Biologically Inspired Plasticity for Streaming Video Analytics  

1. Introduction  
1.1 Background  
Modern deep learning systems typically rely on global, end-to-end backpropagation, executed either on a single powerful server or across tightly synchronized clusters. While highly effective for large‐scale supervised tasks, this paradigm faces four key limitations in edge and streaming contexts:  
- Centralized computation and synchronization overhead precludes deployment on unreliable or resource‐constrained devices.  
- Large memory footprints and global gradient computations impose prohibitive energy and latency costs on low‐power hardware.  
- Real‐time applications (e.g., streaming video analytics) demand rapid local adaptation, which end‐to‐end updates cannot provide.  
- Global backpropagation lacks biological plausibility, whereas biological synapses update using local, asynchronous plasticity rules.  

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework for edge‐localized asynchronous learning inspired by Hebbian and spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity (STDP) principles. Our method enables each device to train a subnetwork autonomously using purely local signals, periodically exchange compressed knowledge with a central server, and dynamically adjust learning parameters via reinforcement learning (RL).  

1.2 Research Objectives  
Our proposal aims to develop, analyze, and validate an edge‐localized learning framework with the following objectives:  
1. Design a hybrid Hebbian‐STDP local learning rule that updates synaptic weights based only on local pre‐ and post‐synaptic activity.  
2. Architect an asynchronous, decentralized communication protocol in which edge devices compress and transmit distilled representations to a central server without global gradient sharing.  
3. Introduce a reinforcement‐learning agent on each device to adapt plasticity rates in real time, balancing local adaptation with global consistency.  
4. Evaluate the proposed framework on streaming video analytics benchmarks, comparing it to global backpropagation and state‐of‐the‐art decentralized learning baselines.  

1.3 Significance  
By replacing global gradient propagation with biologically plausible local rules, our approach seeks to achieve:  
- Scalability: Eliminate the need for device‐level synchronization, enabling robust training over unreliable networks.  
- Efficiency: Reduce communication overhead and memory usage by up to 50%, while meeting real‐time latency requirements (<50 ms).  
- Adaptivity: Allow each device to rapidly adapt to local data distribution shifts in video streams.  
- Biological Plausibility: Provide a bridge between neuroscience‐inspired plasticity and practical edge AI.  

2. Methodology  
2.1 System Overview  
Our system comprises a set $\mathcal{D}=\{1,2,\dots,K\}$ of $K$ edge devices and a central server. Each device $k$ holds a local subnetwork parameterized by weights $W_k$ and receives a stream of video frames. The overall workflow is:  
1. Local training on device $k$ using only local data and local weight‐update rules.  
2. Periodic compression of model outputs into compact “knowledge tokens” using knowledge‐distillation techniques.  
3. Asynchronous upload of tokens to the server, which aggregates them into a global prior distribution.  
4. Broadcast of the updated prior to all devices, integrated into local loss as a regularization term.  
5. Dynamic adjustment of local plasticity rates via an RL policy.  

2.2 Network Architecture  
Each edge device implements a lightweight convolutional feature extractor followed by a shallow classifier. Let $f(W_k; x)$ denote the feature map for input $x$, and $g(\theta_k; f)$ the classification head. We split $W_k$ into layers $L_1,\dots,L_M$. Importantly, no global gradient $\nabla_W L_{\text{global}}$ is ever computed.  

2.3 Local Learning Rule: Hybrid Hebbian‐STDP  
We propose to update each synaptic weight $w_{ij}^m$ in layer $L_m$ using a convex combination of a standard Hebbian term and an STDP term:  
$$
\Delta w_{ij}^m = \lambda_k^m\,\Delta w_{ij}^{\mathrm{Hebb}} + (1-\lambda_k^m)\,\Delta w_{ij}^{\mathrm{STDP}},
$$  
where $\lambda_k^m\in[0,1]$ is a layer‐ and device‐specific plasticity coefficient.  

• Hebbian update:  
$$
\Delta w_{ij}^{\mathrm{Hebb}} = \eta\,a_i^{(m-1)}\,a_j^{(m)}\!,
$$  
where $a_i^{(m-1)}$ is pre‐synaptic activation and $a_j^{(m)}$ is post‐synaptic activation.  

• STDP update: define $\Delta t_{ij}=t_j-t_i$, the firing‐time difference between pre‐ and post‐synaptic events. Then  
$$
\Delta w_{ij}^{\mathrm{STDP}}
=\begin{cases}
A^+\exp\bigl(-\Delta t_{ij}/\tau_+\bigr) & \Delta t_{ij}>0,\\
-A^-\exp\bigl(\Delta t_{ij}/\tau_-\bigr) & \Delta t_{ij}<0.
\end{cases}
$$  

Local updates are applied immediately after each forward event, enabling asynchronous, low‐latency adaptation.  

2.4 Asynchronous Communication via Knowledge Distillation  
Every $T$ local iterations, device $k$ computes a compact knowledge token $C_k$ by sampling soft‐labels from its classifier outputs $g(\theta_k; f(W_k; x))$ on a small batch. We compress $C_k$ (e.g., via quantization) and send it to the server asynchronously. The server aggregates tokens $\{C_k\}$ to form a global prior distribution $P_{\mathrm{global}}(y\mid x)$ using weighted averaging:  
$$
P_{\mathrm{global}}(y\mid x)=\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^K C_k(y\mid x).
$$  

Upon receiving $P_{\mathrm{global}}$, each device augments its local loss with a KL‐divergence term:  
$$
L_{\mathrm{local}}(W_k)
= L_{\mathrm{task}}(W_k) \;+\;\alpha_{\mathrm{KL}}\,D_{\mathrm{KL}}\bigl(P_{\mathrm{global}}\|\;P_k(W_k)\bigr),
$$  
where $P_k(W_k)$ is the device’s own predictive distribution and $\alpha_{\mathrm{KL}}$ controls regularization strength.  

2.5 Dynamic Plasticity via Reinforcement Learning  
To cope with device heterogeneity and model staleness, each device trains a small RL policy $\pi_{\phi_k}(\lambda_k^1,\dots,\lambda_k^M\mid s_k)$ that adjusts plasticity coefficients per layer.  

• State $s_k$ includes:  
  – Current task loss $L_{\mathrm{task}}(W_k)$  
  – Divergence $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_k\|P_{\mathrm{global}})$  
  – Recent communication latency and failure rate  

• Action: set plasticity vector $\lambda_k=[\lambda_k^1,\dots,\lambda_k^M]$.  

• Reward:  
$$
r_k=-L_{\mathrm{task}}(W_k)\;-\;\beta\,D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_k\|P_{\mathrm{global}})\;-\;\gamma\,C_{\mathrm{comm}},
$$  
where $C_{\mathrm{comm}}$ is communication cost incurred in the last period.  

We update $\phi_k$ via policy gradient (REINFORCE) to maximize expected cumulative reward.

Evaluation Metrics  
• Prediction accuracy on held‐out video streams.  
• Communication overhead (total bits exchanged).  
• Latency (ms per update).  
• Energy consumption (estimated via device‐level power models).

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
3.1 Expected Outcomes  
Based on preliminary pilot studies and literature trends, we anticipate:  
- Communication reduction of 30–50% relative to FedAvg and AEDFL, due to compressed knowledge tokens and asynchronous exchange.  
- Real‐time local update latency below 50 ms on micro‐GPU edge hardware.  
- Energy savings of 20–30% per device, as local plasticity avoids expensive gradient backprop.  
- Robust convergence with ≤5% accuracy degradation under 20% device failure scenarios.  
- Improved adaptability: 15% faster recovery when data distributions shift compared to synchronous global learning.  

3.2 Scientific and Practical Impact  
This research will:  
- Advance the theory of localized learning by providing a first rigorous integration of Hebbian‐STDP rules with decentralized asynchronous protocols and RL‐driven plasticity adaptation.  
- Enable practical deployment of adaptive AI for streaming video analytics on commodity edge devices in smart surveillance, autonomous drones, and Internet‐of‐Things infrastructures.  
- Bridge the gap between neuroscience and machine learning, offering biologically inspired designs that are both efficient and effective.  
- Open‐source our framework, benchmarks, and trained models to foster further research in bio‐inspired edge AI.  

In the longer term, our approach could generalize to other modalities (audio, text) and inform new generations of hardware (neuromorphic chips) that natively support local plasticity and asynchronous operation. By synergizing biological insights with modern reinforcement learning and knowledge‐distillation techniques, we aim to redefine scalable, robust, and low‐latency learning at the network edge.
