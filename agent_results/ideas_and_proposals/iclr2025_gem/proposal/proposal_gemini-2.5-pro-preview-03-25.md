**1. Title:** **Accelerating Antibody Affinity Maturation through Iterative Generative Design Guided by Uncertainty-Aware Active Learning**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background:**
Antibodies are cornerstone molecules in modern therapeutics, diagnostics, and research, owing to their exquisite specificity and high affinity for target antigens. The development of effective antibody-based therapies often hinges on engineering variants with optimized properties, particularly enhanced binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) or inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) towards a specific target epitope. This process, known as affinity maturation, traditionally relies on large-scale experimental screening of randomly mutated libraries (e.g., via phage or yeast display), which is labour-intensive, costly, and often explores only a limited fraction of the vast potential sequence space (estimated to be astronomically large for even complementarity-determining regions (CDRs)).

Recent advancements in generative machine learning (ML) have shown significant promise for accelerating biomolecular design [4, 9, 10]. Models like ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF, diffusion models [7, 9, 10], and generative language models [4] can propose novel antibody sequences *in silico*, potentially enriched for desired properties. These methods leverage large datasets of known protein sequences and structures (e.g., from SAbDab, PDB, OAS) to learn the complex sequence-structure-function relationships governing antibody binding. Techniques range from fixed-backbone sequence design to joint sequence-structure generation and optimization based on predicted energy or other constraints [6, 10].

However, a critical bottleneck persists: translating *in silico* designs into experimentally validated, high-affinity binders. Generative models often produce hundreds or thousands of candidate sequences, but experimentally testing each one for binding affinity using methods like Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) or Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) remains prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. This creates a significant disconnect between the rapid pace of computational design and the slower, resource-limited nature of experimental validation, hindering the real-world impact of generative ML in antibody engineering, a core challenge highlighted by the Generative and Experimental perspectives in bioMolecular design (GEM) workshop. Simply optimizing for *in silico* benchmarks without considering experimental feasibility limits practical translation.

**2.2 Problem Statement:**
The primary challenge addressed by this research is the inefficiency of the current workflow linking *in silico* generative antibody design with experimental validation for affinity maturation. While generative models can propose numerous candidates, the lack of intelligent strategies to prioritize experimental testing leads to wasted resources and slows down the discovery of highly potent antibodies. There is a pressing need for methods that can guide the experimental process, focusing efforts on the most promising candidates predicted by computational models, thereby bridging the computational-experimental gap.

**2.3 Proposed Solution:**
We propose an **Iterative Generative Active Learning (IGAL) framework** for antibody affinity maturation. This framework integrates a generative sequence model with an active learning (AL) strategy to iteratively guide wet-lab experiments. The core idea is to create a closed feedback loop:
1.  **Generate:** A generative model proposes diverse antibody variant sequences based on a parent antibody sequence and optionally, antigen structure information.
2.  **Predict & Select (AL):** A predictive model estimates the binding affinity (or a related property) for the generated candidates. An active learning acquisition function then selects a small, maximally informative batch of candidates for experimental validation, prioritizing sequences where the model is most uncertain or which are predicted to yield the largest improvement.
3.  **Experiment:** The selected candidates are synthesized and experimentally tested (e.g., using yeast display followed by sorting and sequencing, or direct SPR/BLI for purified variants) to measure their true binding affinities.
4.  **Refine:** The experimental results (sequence-affinity pairs) are used to update and improve both the generative model (e.g., biasing towards successful sequence motifs) and the predictive model (improving affinity prediction accuracy).
5.  **Iterate:** The loop repeats, with refined models guiding the next round of generation, selection, and experimentation, progressively focusing the search towards higher-affinity variants.

This approach mirrors concepts explored recently in related works applying active learning or Bayesian optimization to antibody design [1, 2, 5] and drug discovery [8], but aims to create a tightly integrated, iterative loop specifically designed for efficient affinity maturation by leveraging uncertainty quantification within the active learning step.

**2.4 Research Objectives:**
1.  **Develop the IGAL framework:** Implement the computational pipeline integrating generative sequence models (e.g., ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF adaptations), affinity prediction models, and an uncertainty-aware active learning strategy.
2.  **Implement Uncertainty-Aware Acquisition:** Design and evaluate specific active learning acquisition functions (e.g., based on model predictive uncertainty, expected improvement) tailored for antibody affinity data.
3.  **Simulate and Validate *In Silico*:** Validate the framework's efficiency using *in silico* experiments with an oracle function (e.g., a highly accurate structure-based energy function or a held-out experimental dataset) to simulate wet-lab feedback. Compare IGAL against baseline strategies like random sampling and greedy selection based purely on predicted affinity.
4.  **Demonstrate Experimental Efficiency Gain:** Quantify the reduction in the number of experimental measurements required to achieve a target affinity improvement compared to traditional or non-AL guided approaches.
5.  **(Optional/Collaborative Goal):** Apply the validated IGAL framework to a real-world antibody affinity maturation campaign in collaboration with experimental partners, demonstrating its practical utility.

**2.5 Significance:**
This research directly addresses the critical need identified by the GEM workshop to bridge the gap between *in silico* modeling and experimental biology in biomolecular design. By intelligently guiding experimentation, the proposed IGAL framework has the potential to:
*   **Accelerate Therapeutic Discovery:** Significantly reduce the time and cost required for antibody affinity maturation, speeding up the development of new antibody-based drugs and diagnostics.
*   **Improve Resource Allocation:** Maximize the information gained from limited experimental resources, making antibody engineering more accessible and efficient.
*   **Advance ML for Biology:** Provide a robust, validated framework for integrating generative models and active learning in a closed-loop experimental design setting, offering insights applicable to other biomolecular design problems.
*   **Contribute Methodologically:** Enhance understanding of effective active learning strategies and uncertainty quantification in the context of high-dimensional, discrete sequence spaces characteristic of protein design.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework:**
The IGAL framework operates in iterative rounds, as depicted below (conceptual):

`[Start with Parent Antibody & Target Antigen]`
    `|`
    `v`
`Round t:`
`--> [1. Generate Candidates (Generative Model)]`
    `|`
    `v`
`--> [2. Predict Affinity & Uncertainty (Predictive Model)]`
    `|`
    `v`
`--> [3. Select Batch (Active Learning Acquisition Function)] -- Size = B`
    `|`
    `v`
`--> [4. Experimental Validation (Measure Affinity for B candidates)] --> {Sequence_i, Affinity_i}_(i=1..B)`
    `|`
    `v`
`--> [5. Update Dataset (Add new data)]`
    `|`
    `v`
`--> [6. Refine Models (Fine-tune Generative & Predictive Models)]`
    `|`
    `Loop to Round t+1 until convergence/budget exhaustion`

**3.2 Data Collection and Preparation:**
*   **Initial Data:** The process starts with a known antibody sequence (parent) and its target antigen (structure often required). Public datasets like SAbDab [11] and OAS [12] will be used for pre-training or baseline model training.
*   **Experimental Data Generation:** Experimental affinity measurements (K<sub>d</sub>, IC<sub>50</sub>, or proxy values from high-throughput screens like yeast display enrichment scores) for the selected variants constitute the feedback data. We will initially simulate this using an oracle function (see 3.6). For potential future wet-lab validation, standard methods like yeast surface display coupled with Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and deep sequencing, or individual variant expression followed by SPR/BLI would be employed. The precise experimental method dictates the nature and noise level of the feedback signal.

**3.3 Generative Model:**
*   **Model Choice:** We will primarily explore structure-conditioned sequence generation models like ProteinMPNN [13] or ESM-IF [14]. These models take a protein backbone structure (e.g., the antibody-antigen complex with mutations allowed in CDRs) and predict likely amino acid sequences. Alternatively, structure-agnostic language models fine-tuned on antibody sequences [4] or diffusion models operating on sequence/structure [7, 9, 10] could be adapted.
*   **Generation Process:** Given the parent antibody-antigen complex structure, we will mask specific regions (e.g., CDR loops) and use the generative model to propose sequence variants. To encourage exploration, techniques like temperature sampling or top-k/nucleus sampling will be employed. The model can be conditioned to maintain key structural motifs or parent residues if needed.
*   **Refinement:** After each experimental round, the generative model can be fine-tuned. One approach is to use the newly validated high-affinity sequences as positive examples, potentially using reinforcement learning principles or simply fine-tuning the model's likelihood objective on sequences weighted by their measured affinity. The goal is to bias future generation towards promising regions of the sequence space.

**3.4 Affinity Predictor Model:**
*   **Model Choice:** A separate model is needed to predict binding affinity *in silico* to guide the AL selection. Options include:
    *   Structure-based energy functions (e.g., Rosetta ddG [15]). Computationally expensive but potentially accurate.
    *   ML-based regressors (e.g., Gradient Boosting Machines, Graph Neural Networks on the complex interface, or Protein Language Model embeddings fed into a regressor). These require labeled training data (affinity measurements).
    *   Hybrid models combining sequence and structure information [3, 7].
*   **Training & Uncertainty:** The predictor will be trained on all available sequence-affinity data (initial dataset + data from previous rounds). Crucially, we will employ methods that provide uncertainty estimates along with predictions. Options include:
    *   Using ensemble models (training multiple predictors on different data subsets/initializations) and calculating variance in predictions.
    *   Employing Bayesian methods like Gaussian Processes (computationally expensive for large datasets) or Monte Carlo Dropout in neural networks.
    *   Conformal Prediction for distribution-free uncertainty bounds.
    Let $f(x)$ be the predictor model for affinity given a sequence $x$. We need both the predicted affinity $\hat{y} = E[f(x)]$ and an uncertainty measure $U(x)$, e.g., $U(x) = Var[f(x)]$.
*   **Refinement:** The predictor model will be retrained or fine-tuned after each round by incorporating the new set of experimentally validated `{Sequence_i, Affinity_i}` pairs.

**3.5 Active Learning Strategy:**
*   **Goal:** Select a batch $B$ of $k$ candidate sequences from a larger pool $P$ generated by the generative model, maximizing the expected information gain or progress towards high-affinity variants.
*   **Acquisition Functions:** We will investigate and compare several acquisition functions, $a(x)$, to score candidates $x \in P$:
    1.  **Uncertainty Sampling (US):** Prioritize sequences where the predictor model is most uncertain.
        $$a_{US}(x) = U(x)$$
        This encourages exploration of sequence space regions where the model is ignorant.
    2.  **Expected Improvement (EI):** Prioritize sequences expected to yield the greatest affinity improvement over the current best observed affinity, $y_{best}$. Requires a probabilistic predictor.
        $$a_{EI}(x) = E[\max(0, f(x) - y_{best})]$$
        (Assuming higher affinity score is better; adjust signs if using K<sub>d</sub>). This balances exploitation (high predicted affinity) and exploration (uncertainty).
    3.  **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** Explicitly balance exploitation and exploration using a trade-off parameter $\beta$.
        $$a_{UCB}(x) = \hat{y}(x) + \beta \sqrt{U(x)}$$
*   **Batch Selection:** Selecting a batch of $k > 1$ candidates requires care to ensure diversity within the batch. Simple greedy selection based on the acquisition function might pick redundant candidates. We will employ batch-aware selection methods, possibly by penalizing candidates similar (e.g., in sequence or predicted embedding space) to already selected candidates within the batch.
*   **Pool Generation:** The pool $P$ will consist of sequences generated by the generative model in the current round, possibly filtered for basic feasibility (e.g., removing sequences with unlikely motifs).

**3.6 Experimental Design for Validation (*In Silico* Simulation):**
*   **Oracle Function:** To efficiently test the IGAL framework without relying on immediate wet-lab resources, we will use an *in silico* oracle. This could be:
    *   A high-fidelity biophysical simulation (e.g., extensive Rosetta ddG calculations or MD simulations, if computationally feasible for a limited benchmark system).
    *   A held-out experimental dataset: Train initial models on one subset of a large experimental affinity dataset (e.g., from deep mutational scanning) and use another subset as the "oracle" lookup table for simulated experiments.
    *   A separate, highly accurate ML model trained on a much larger dataset, treated as ground truth.
*   **Target System:** We will select a well-characterized antibody-antigen pair for which some structural information and potentially mutational affinity data are available (e.g., synthesizing data based on known structures or using published DMS datasets).
*   **Baselines:** We will compare the performance of IGAL against:
    1.  **Random Sampling:** Select $k$ candidates randomly from the generated pool $P$.
    2.  **Greedy Selection:** Select the top $k$ candidates based solely on the predicted affinity $\hat{y}(x)$ from the predictor model (pure exploitation).
    3.  (Optional) Standard Bayesian Optimization if applicable [2].
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Convergence Speed:** Number of experimental rounds (or total simulated experiments, $t \times k$) required to identify an antibody variant surpassing a predefined target affinity threshold.
    2.  **Best Affinity Found:** The highest affinity achieved within a fixed experimental budget (total number of simulated experiments).
    3.  **Sample Efficiency:** Affinity improvement per simulated experiment.
    4.  **Predictive Model Accuracy:** Track the performance (e.g., RMSE, R<sup>2</sup>, Spearman correlation) of the affinity predictor model on held-out test data as it gets refined with actively selected samples.
    5.  **Diversity of Top Candidates:** Analyze the sequence diversity among the high-affinity candidates discovered by different methods.

**3.7 Computational Resources:**
Access to high-performance computing (HPC) clusters with GPU acceleration will be required for training generative and predictive deep learning models, running structure-based calculations (if used), and performing simulations.
