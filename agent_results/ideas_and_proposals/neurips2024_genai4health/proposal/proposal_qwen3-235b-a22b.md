# Dynamic Benchmarking Framework for Trustworthy GenAI in Healthcare  

## Introduction  

### Background  
Generative AI (GenAI) models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-modal systems, have demonstrated transformative potential in healthcare, including applications in diagnosis, treatment planning, and synthetic data generation. However, their deployment faces significant barriers due to inconsistent safety evaluations, ethical disparities, and misalignment with evolving health policies. Current benchmarks for GenAI trustworthiness often lack adaptability to rare clinical scenarios, multi-modal data complexities, and dynamic regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR). This gap risks unreliable model performance, biased outcomes, and erosion of stakeholder trust.  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a **dynamic benchmarking framework** that systematically evaluates the trustworthiness of GenAI models in healthcare contexts. The framework will:  
1. Simulate diverse clinical scenarios, including rare diseases and underrepresented populations, using policy-compliant synthetic data.  
2. Assess model reliability across multi-modal inputs (text, imaging, genomics).  
3. Integrate real-time clinician feedback to align outputs with clinical standards.  
4. Quantify explainability and fairness metrics for regulatory compliance.  
5. Generate actionable risk scores and compliance reports to guide iterative model refinement.  

### Significance  
By addressing limitations in static benchmarks, this framework will:  
- Enhance trust in GenAI through rigorous, adaptive evaluation.  
- Bridge the gap between technical advancements and policy requirements.  
- Mitigate ethical risks (e.g., bias amplification) in healthcare applications.  
- Accelerate the deployment of safe, equitable AI-driven solutions in clinical settings.

## Methodology  

### Framework Overview  
The proposed framework comprises four interconnected modules (Figure 1):  
1. **Synthetic Data Generator**: Creates edge-case and policy-compliant scenarios.  
2. **Multi-Modal Evaluator**: Tests model consistency across heterogeneous data.  
3. **Clinician Feedback Loop**: Validates outputs against clinical guidelines.  
4. **Explainability & Compliance Analyzer**: Quantifies transparency and policy alignment.

### Module 1: Synthetic Data Generator  

#### Design  
This module integrates state-of-the-art generative models to produce synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and multi-modal datasets with controlled biases and policy constraints. Building on Bt-GAN (2024) and HiSGT (2025), it incorporates:  
- **Bias-Transforming Mechanisms**: Adjusts data distributions to represent underrepresented groups using weighted sampling:  
  $$ \mathcal{L}_{fair} = \alpha \cdot \mathcal{L}_{task} + \beta \cdot \mathcal{L}_{bias} $$  
  where $\mathcal{L}_{task}$ is the primary generation loss, $\mathcal{L}_{bias}$ penalizes demographic imbalances, and $\alpha, \beta$ control trade-offs.  
- **Policy-Compliant Constraints**: Embeds regulations (e.g., HIPAA) as differentiable constraints during training.  

#### Edge-Case Simulation  
To evaluate robustness, the generator creates synthetic "stress-test" scenarios:  
- Rare diseases (e.g., <1:100,000 prevalence) using hierarchical semantic graphs (HiSGT-inspired).  
- Adversarial examples (e.g., ambiguous imaging artifacts) to challenge diagnostic reliability.  

#### Validation Metrics  
- **Clinical Fidelity**: Measured via Wasserstein distances between real and synthetic data distributions.  
- **Fairness**: Demographic parity difference (DPD) and equal opportunity difference (EOD):  
  $$ \text{DPD} = |P(\hat{Y}=1 | A=0) - P(\hat{Y}=1 | A=1)| $$  
  where $A$ denotes a protected attribute (e.g., race).

### Module 2: Multi-Modal Evaluator  

#### Input Modalities  
The framework evaluates GenAI models on three modalities:  
1. **Text**: Clinical notes, discharge summaries.  
2. **Imaging**: Radiology/X-ray images with annotated pathologies.  
3. **Genomics**: Synthetic DNA sequences with labeled mutations.  

#### Consistency Metrics  
- **Cross-Modal Alignment**: Uses CLIP-style contrastive loss to measure coherence between text-image pairs:  
  $$ \mathcal{L}_{align} = -\log \frac{\exp(z^\top_i z_t / \tau)}{\sum_{j \neq i} \exp(z^\top_j z_t / \tau)} $$  
  where $z_i, z_t$ are image/text embeddings and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.  
- **Task-Specific Reliability**: For diagnostic models, computes inter-modality agreement (e.g., Cohen’s κ between imaging and genomic predictions).  

---

### Module 3: Real-Time Clinician Feedback Loop  

#### Workflow  
1. Clinicians review model outputs (e.g., treatment recommendations) via an interactive dashboard.  
2. Feedback is encoded as scalar rewards using a Bradley-Terry model:  
   $$ P(i \succ j) = \frac{e^{\theta_i}}{e^{\theta_i} + e^{\theta_j}} $$  
   where $\theta_i$ represents the latent quality of output $i$.  
3. Rewards update the framework’s evaluation criteria via online learning.  

#### Integration with Policy Makers  
A policy alignment sub-module maps clinician feedback to regulatory requirements (e.g., FDA guidelines for AI/ML-based software).  

---

### Module 4: Explainability & Compliance Analyzer  

#### Quantitative Metrics  
- **Local Explanations**: SHAP values for feature importance in individual predictions.  
- **Global Transparency**: Faithfulness score ($\mathcal{F}$) measuring alignment between explanations and model behavior:  
  $$ \mathcal{F} = 1 - \frac{\|f(x) - g(x)\|_2}{\|f(x)\|_2} $$  
  where $f$ is the model and $g$ is its interpretable approximation.  

#### Compliance Scoring  
A policy compliance index ($\mathcal{PCI}$) aggregates adherence to regulations:  
$$ \mathcal{PCI} = \sum_{k=1}^K w_k \cdot \text{Compliance}_k $$  
where $w_k$ weights policies by clinical criticality.
