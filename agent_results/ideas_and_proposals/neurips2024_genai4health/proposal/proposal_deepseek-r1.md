**1. Title:**  
Dynamic Benchmarking Framework for Trustworthy GenAI in Healthcare: Adaptive Evaluation of Safety, Compliance, and Clinical Fidelity  

---

**2. Introduction**  

**Background**  
Generative AI (GenAI) holds transformative potential for healthcare applications, including synthetic data generation, diagnostic assistance, and personalized treatment planning. However, its adoption is hindered by persistent concerns about trustworthiness, including bias amplification, regulatory non-compliance, and inconsistent performance across diverse clinical scenarios. Existing benchmarks for evaluating GenAI models in healthcare often rely on static datasets and simplistic metrics, failing to adapt to evolving policies (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), rare medical conditions, or multi-modal data integration. For instance, models trained on homogeneous datasets may underperform for underrepresented populations or fail to meet region-specific regulatory standards, undermining clinical reliability and ethical accountability.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research proposes the development of a **dynamic benchmarking framework** to holistically evaluate the trustworthiness of GenAI models in healthcare. Key objectives include:  
1. Designing adaptive synthetic data generators that simulate edge cases (e.g., rare diseases) and policy-compliant scenarios.  
2. Establishing multi-modal evaluation protocols to assess model consistency across text, imaging, and genomic data.  
3. Integrating real-time clinician feedback loops to validate outputs against clinical standards.  
4. Quantifying explainability and compliance with healthcare policies to guide iterative model refinement.  

**Significance**  
By addressing the limitations of current static benchmarks, this framework will provide a standardized, reproducible, and policy-aware evaluation toolkit. It will enable developers to identify and mitigate risks (e.g., bias, privacy violations) during model deployment, foster trust among clinicians and patients, and accelerate the ethical adoption of GenAI in healthcare.

**3. Methodology**  

**3.1 Framework Architecture**  
The framework consists of four interconnected modules (Figure 1):  
1. **Synthetic Data Generator**: Creates diverse, policy-compliant datasets.  
2. **Multi-Modal Testing Engine**: Evaluates model performance across data types.  
3. **Clinician Feedback Interface**: Collects real-time validation from medical experts.  
4. **Explainability & Compliance Analyzer**: Generates risk scores and compliance reports.  

**3.2 Synthetic Data Generation**  
Building on recent advances in generative models, we propose a hierarchical synthesis pipeline:  
- **Policy-aware Data Simulation**: Integrate healthcare policy constraints (e.g., HIPAA anonymization rules) into generative models like Bt-GAN [1] and HiSGT [4]. For example, HiSGT’s transformer architecture will be enhanced to enforce semantic consistency with clinical coding systems (e.g., ICD-10) and demographic fairness.  
- **Bias Mitigation**: Adopt Bt-GAN’s score-based weighted sampling to balance underrepresented groups, formalized as:  
  $$  
  w_c = \frac{1}{P_{\text{train}}(c)} \quad \text{for class } c,  
  $$  
  where $P_{\text{train}}(c)$ is the prevalence of class $c$ in training data, ensuring equitable representation.  
- **Edge Case Synthesis**: Use adversarial training to generate rare disease scenarios by perturbing input embeddings in low-density regions of the data manifold.  

**3.3 Multi-Modal Input Testing**  
To assess cross-modal reliability, the framework will:  
1. **Generate Paired Data**: Use discGAN [2] to synthesize aligned tabular, imaging, and genomic records (e.g., EHRs with corresponding MRI scans).  
2. **Consistency Metrics**: Compute modality alignment scores using contrastive learning. For two modalities $M_1$ and $M_2$, the alignment loss is:  
  $$  
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{align}} = -\log \frac{\exp(f(M_1)^\top f(M_2))}{\sum_{j=1}^N \exp(f(M_1)^\top f(M_j'))},  
  $$  
  where $f$ is a shared encoder and $M_j'$ are negative samples.  

**3.4 Real-Time Clinician Feedback Loop**  
A web-based interface will allow clinicians to:  
1. **Annotate Outputs**: Rate the plausibility of GenAI-generated diagnoses/treatment plans on a Likert scale.  
2. **Flag Errors**: Identify hallucinations or policy violations (e.g., data privacy breaches).  
Feedback will be aggregated into a trust score $T$, computed as:  
$$  
T = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \left( \alpha \cdot \text{Accuracy}_i + \beta \cdot \text{Compliance}_i \right),  
$$  
where $\alpha$, $\beta$ are weights reflecting clinical priorities.  

**3.5 Explainability & Compliance Metrics**  
- **Policy Compliance Checker**: A rule-based engine will scan model outputs for adherence to regulations (e.g., GDPR Article 22 restrictions on automated decision-making).  
- **Explainability Scores**: Use SHAP values to quantify feature importance:  
  $$  
  \phi_i(f, x) = \sum_{S \subseteq F \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|! (|F| - |S| - 1)!}{|F|!} \left[ f(x_S \cup \{i\}) - f(x_S) \right],  
  $$  
  where $F$ is the feature set. Higher variance in $\phi_i$ across demographic groups indicates potential bias.  

**3.6 Experimental Design**  
- **Datasets**:  
  - **Synthetic**: Generated using HiSGT and discGAN for rare diseases (e.g., Huntington’s disease prevalence < 0.01%).  
  - **Real-World**: MIMIC-III EHRs, TCGA genomics, and BRATS MRI scans (anonymized and policy-compliant).  
- **Baselines**: Compare against static benchmarks (e.g., MedQA for LLMs) and synthetic data tools (Bt-GAN, HiSGT).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  1. **Fairness**: Demographic parity difference: $|\text{Accuracy}_{g_1} - \text{Accuracy}_{g_2}|$.  
  2. **Compliance**: % of outputs violating HIPAA/GDPR.  
  3. **Clinical Fidelity**: BLEU score for synthetic clinical notes, Dice coefficient for synthetic MRI scans.  
  4. **Explainability**: SHAP value consistency across clinician assessments (Krippendorff’s $\alpha$).

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. An open-source framework for dynamically evaluating GenAI models in healthcare, compatible with LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) and multi-modal systems.  
2. Novel metrics for quantifying policy compliance and explainability, validated through clinician surveys.  
3. A repository of synthetic datasets simulating rare diseases and policy constraints (e.g., HIPAA-compliant synthetic EHRs).  
4. Evidence-based guidelines for mitigating bias and improving transparency in GenAI deployment.  

**Impact**  
This research will directly address the trustworthiness gaps identified in the literature, such as bias in synthetic data [1, 2] and poor clinical fidelity [4]. By enabling policy-aware benchmarking, it will help developers align GenAI systems with ethical guidelines, reducing regulatory risks. Clinicians will gain tools to verify model reliability, fostering adoption in high-stakes settings. Ultimately, the framework will accelerate the integration of GenAI into healthcare while ensuring patient safety and equity.
