Title  
Dynamic Benchmarking Framework for Trustworthy Generative AI in Healthcare  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Generative AI (GenAI) models, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi‐modal architectures, promise transformative advances in healthcare: from automated report drafting and treatment planning to simulation of clinical trials and digital twins. Yet recent studies highlight persistent concerns about safety, fairness, and policy compliance. Benchmarks such as medical question‐answering scores or image‐classification accuracy capture only narrow aspects of performance. They fail to adapt to evolving regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), rare‐disease edge cases, and the nuanced, multi‐ethnic contexts inherent in real‐world care. Without rigorous, context‐aware evaluation, deployment of GenAI in clinical settings risks misdiagnosis, privacy breaches, and ethical disparities.  

Literature surveys reveal key limitations:  
• Bt-GAN (Ramachandranpillai et al., 2024) generates fair synthetic EHR data but focuses solely on tabular fairness.  
• discGAN (Fuentes et al., 2023) captures multi‐modal distributions in tabular records without policy‐driven constraints.  
• VAE/GAN hybrids (Jadon & Kumar, 2023) balance privacy and utility but lack multi‐modal and explainability evaluations.  
• HiSGT (Zhou & Barbieri, 2025) improves clinical fidelity via hierarchical transformers yet omits real‐time clinician feedback and policy compliance.  

Research Objectives  
We propose to develop a *Dynamic Benchmarking Framework* (DBF) that:  
1. Simulates diverse clinical contexts—including rare diseases, multi‐ethnic cohorts, and evolving policy constraints—via synthetic data generators.  
2. Integrates text, imaging, and genomics in unified multi‐modal test suites.  
3. Embeds real‐time clinician feedback loops to validate clinical outputs.  
4. Quantifies explainability and policy compliance in standardized metrics.  

Significance  
By delivering adaptive, policy‐aligned benchmarks, DBF will:  
– Enhance reliability, fairness, and safety of GenAI systems in health.  
– Foster trust among clinicians, patients, and regulators.  
– Accelerate ethical, compliant AI adoption in medicine.  

2. Methodology  
2.1 Overview of Framework Architecture  
The DBF consists of four interconnected modules:  
1. Synthetic Data Generation (SDG)  
2. Multi‐Modal Test Suite (MMTS)  
3. Clinician Feedback Loop (CFL)  
4. Explainability & Compliance Scoring (ECS)  

These modules operate in an iterative pipeline (Figure 1). Each iteration produces a new benchmark release with updated scenarios, metrics, and policy constraints.  

2.2 Synthetic Data Generation (SDG)  
We extend Bt-GAN, discGAN, and HiSGT into a unified SDG that produces policy‐compliant, unbiased synthetic datasets for EHR, radiology images, and genomic profiles.  

2.2.1 Data and Policy Constraints  
Let $D_{\text{real}}=\{x_i,a_i,y_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be a real‐world dataset, where $x_i$ denotes features (tabular, images, sequences), $a_i$ protected attributes (e.g., ethnicity), and $y_i$ labels (diagnoses). Define policy constraints $C=\{c_j\}$, e.g., HIPAA privacy budgets and GDPR anonymization thresholds.  

2.2.2 Generator and Discriminator  
We train a hybrid generator $G(z;\theta)$ and discriminator $D(x;\phi)$ on latent variables $z\sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$. The SDG loss function augments the classical GAN objective with fairness and privacy penalties:  
$$
\min_\theta \max_\phi V(D,G)
=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim D_{\text{real}}}[\log D(x)] 
+\mathbb{E}_{z\sim \mathcal{N}}[\log(1-D(G(z)))]
+ \lambda_f \mathcal{L}_{\text{fair}}(\theta)
+ \lambda_p \mathcal{L}_{\text{priv}}(\theta, C).
$$  
Here,  
• $\mathcal{L}_{\text{fair}}$ enforces equal distributions across protected groups via score‐based reweighting:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{fair}} = \sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}} \Big\|\mathbb{E}[G(z)\mid a] - \mathbb{E}[D_{\text{real}}\mid a]\Big\|^2.
$$  
• $\mathcal{L}_{\text{priv}}$ enforces differential privacy or HIPAA‐style noise injection.  

2.2.3 Multi‐Modal Synthesis  
We implement modality‐specific sub‐networks:  
– Tabular: Fully connected layers with conditional normalization (discGAN‐style).  
– Imaging: Convolutional ResNet encoder/decoder (HiSGT‐style semantic embeddings).  
– Genomics: Transformer blocks with hierarchical embedding as in HiSGT.  

2.2.4 Pseudocode for SDG Training  

```
Input: Real data D_real, policy constraints C, hyperparams λ_f, λ_p  
Initialize θ, φ  
while not converged do  
   Sample minibatch real x, a from D_real  
   Sample z ∼ N(0,I)  
   x_fake = G(z;θ)  
   # Discriminator step  
   φ ← φ + η ∇_φ [log D(x) + log(1−D(x_fake))]  
   # Generator step  
   Compute L_fair, L_priv using x_fake, a, C  
   θ ← θ − η ∇_θ [−log D(x_fake) + λ_f L_fair + λ_p L_priv]  
end  
Output: Synthetic dataset D_syn = {G(z_k)}  
```  

2.3 Multi‐Modal Test Suite (MMTS)  
2.3.1 Scenario Generation  
We define test scenarios $S=\{s_1,\dots,s_M\}$ parameterized by disease prevalence, demographic mix, and policy settings. Each scenario $s_j$ yields a test set of synthetic records and real‐world subsets.  

2.3.2 Task Definitions  
For each scenario, we pose tasks:  
– Diagnosis ($T_{\text{diag}}$): predict $y$ from $x$.  
– Treatment suggestion ($T_{\text{treat}}$): generate care plans.  
– Data synthesis validation ($T_{\text{syn}}$): discriminate synthetic vs. real.  

2.4 Clinician Feedback Loop (CFL)  
We recruit a panel of $K$ clinicians. For each model output $o_{ij}$ on sample $x_i$, clinician $k$ provides a rating $r_{ijk}\in[-1,1]$ on clinical validity. We use active‐learning to select samples with highest uncertainty (e.g., via model entropy) for feedback.  

2.4.1 Feedback‐Driven Model Refinement  
At iteration $t$, we maintain a feedback set $F_t=\{(x_i,o_{ij},r_{ijk})\}$. We train a calibration network $H(o)\to \hat{r}$ to predict clinician ratings. We then adjust model confidence via:  
$$
\text{Confidence}'(o) = \alpha\cdot \text{Confidence}(o) + (1-\alpha)\,H(o).
$$  

2.4.2 Algorithm for CFL  

```
for each iteration t:  
   1. Run GenAI model M on scenario S → outputs {o_ij}.  
   2. Select top-U uncertain outputs via entropy.  
   3. Obtain clinician ratings r_ijk for selected outputs.  
   4. Update calibration network H with new (o_ij,r_ijk).  
   5. Update model confidence estimates and record CFL metrics.  
end
```  

2.5 Explainability & Compliance Scoring (ECS)  
2.5.1 Explainability Metrics  
We compute:  
– *Fidelity* (faithfulness) via input‐perturbation saliency:  
$$
\text{Fidelity} = 1 - \frac{1}{N}\sum_i|f(x_i)-f(x_i\setminus \Delta)|,
$$  
where $\Delta$ masks top‐k salient features.  
– *Completeness* via concept activation: percentage of human‐interpretable concepts covered.  

2.5.2 Fairness Metrics  
– *Demographic Parity Difference* (DPD):  
$$
\text{DPD} = \big|P(\hat y=1\mid a=0) - P(\hat y=1\mid a=1)\big|.
$$  

2.5.3 Policy Compliance Score  
For each $c_j\in C$, define indicator $I_j(\text{model})\in\{0,1\}$ whether the model violates constraint. Then  
$$
\text{Compliance} = 1 - \frac{1}{|C|}\sum_j I_j(\text{model}).
$$  

2.6 Experimental Design  
2.6.1 Models Under Test  
• GPT‐4‐based clinical assistant (text)  
• MedPaLM2 (multi‐modal)  
• Custom fine‐tuned BioBERT + U‐Net (imaging + text)  

2.6.2 Evaluation Protocol  
For each model, scenario $s\in S$, and task $T$, we compute:  
– Accuracy / F1 (classification tasks)  
– BLEU / ROUGE (generation tasks)  
– Calibration error (ECE)  
– DPD (fairness)  
– Fidelity & completeness (explainability)  
– Compliance score  

Perform 5‐fold cross‐scenario testing. Use paired t‐tests to compare dynamic versus static benchmarks.  

2.6.3 Resource Requirements  
• Synthetic data compute: 8 GPUs × 2 weeks  
• Clinician panel: $K=10$ experts × 5 days  
• Software: PyTorch, HuggingFace, SHAP  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
3.1 Standardized Dynamic Benchmark  
A publicly released DBF toolkit containing:  
– Synthetic data generators with tunable bias/privacy parameters.  
– Multi‐modal test suites across $M\ge 20$ clinical scenarios.  
– Automated pipelines for clinician feedback integration.  
– Open‐source dashboard reporting explainability, fairness, and compliance.  

3.2 Enhanced Model Trustworthiness  
Our benchmarking will demonstrate that state‐of‐the‐art GenAI models, when evaluated under DBF, achieve:  
– ≤5% calibration error for diagnosis tasks.  
– DPD ≤0.03 across protected groups.  
– Compliance score ≥0.95 under HIPAA‐like constraints.  

These improvements will provide quantitative evidence to stakeholders that GenAI systems meet rigorous safety and fairness standards.  

3.3 Policy and Clinical Adoption  
By aligning evaluations with real‐world policy constraints and clinical feedback, DBF will:  
– Inform regulatory guidelines (e.g., FDA AI/ML Draft Guidance).  
– Serve as a reference pipeline for hospitals adopting GenAI tools.  
– Promote multidisciplinary collaboration among researchers, clinicians, and policymakers.  

3.4 Long‐Term Vision  
Beyond initial release, we plan to:  
– Update scenarios as policies and medical knowledge evolve.  
– Extend modalities (e.g., real‐time biosensors).  
– Establish a consortium for continuous benchmark governance.  

In summary, the Dynamic Benchmarking Framework will fill a critical gap in evaluating GenAI for healthcare. By uniting synthetic data, multi‐modality, clinician expertise, and policy compliance into a single adaptive pipeline, our work aims to accelerate safe, fair, and trustworthy AI integration into clinical practice.
