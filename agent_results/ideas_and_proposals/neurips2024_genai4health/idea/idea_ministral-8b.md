### Title: Enhancing Patient Trust through Transparent and Explainable GenAI in Healthcare

### Motivation:
The integration of Generative AI (GenAI) in healthcare holds enormous potential but is hindered by public trust issues, particularly concerning privacy, safety, and ethical concerns. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the safe, effective, and ethical deployment of GenAI in healthcare applications.

### Main Idea:
This research focuses on developing transparent and explainable GenAI models that enhance patient trust and ensure compliance with healthcare policies. The proposed methodology involves:

1. **Data Privacy and Security**: Implementing differential privacy techniques to protect patient data while maintaining the integrity of the GenAI models.
2. **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Developing XAI models that provide clear explanations of the AI's decisions, making it easier for healthcare professionals and patients to understand and trust the AI's outputs.
3. **Policy Compliance**: Collaborating with policymakers to create guidelines that ensure GenAI models are compliant with existing healthcare regulations and standards.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved patient trust in GenAI-driven healthcare solutions.
- Enhanced transparency and explainability of GenAI models.
- Compliance with healthcare policies and regulations.

Potential impact includes:
- Increased adoption of GenAI in healthcare, leading to better patient outcomes.
- Strengthened public trust in AI-driven healthcare solutions.
- A harmonious integration of GenAI with existing healthcare infrastructure and regulations.
