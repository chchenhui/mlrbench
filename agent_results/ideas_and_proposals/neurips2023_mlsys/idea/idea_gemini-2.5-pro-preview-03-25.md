**Title:** Adaptive Compiler Partitioning for Distributed LLM Training using Reinforcement Learning

**Motivation:** Efficiently training Large Language Models (LLMs) across thousands of accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) is bottlenecked by suboptimal partitioning strategies. Current compiler heuristics struggle to find optimal parallelization schemes (data, tensor, pipeline) considering complex model architectures and heterogeneous hardware topologies, leading to communication overhead and underutilized resources.

**Main Idea:** We propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to learn adaptive partitioning strategies for distributed LLM training. The RL agent, potentially guided by graph neural network embeddings of the computation graph and hardware topology, will learn a policy to select optimal partitioning schemes (e.g., tensor sharding configurations, pipeline stage assignments) dynamically. It will optimize for objectives like minimizing end-to-end training time or maximizing hardware utilization, using real-time feedback from the training process (e.g., communication costs, memory usage, compute times). This approach aims to outperform static compiler heuristics by adapting to runtime conditions and different model/hardware combinations, leading to faster training convergence and improved resource efficiency.
