**Title:** Principled Analysis of Empirically Successful RL Heuristics

**Motivation:** State-of-the-art RL systems often rely on complex architectures and heuristics (e.g., specific replay mechanisms, data augmentation, exploration bonuses) that achieve strong empirical performance but lack theoretical grounding. This gap hinders our ability to understand *why* they work, predict their generalization, or systematically improve them. Aligning theory and practice requires explaining the success of these practical "tricks."

**Main Idea:** We propose identifying core heuristics responsible for significant performance gains in widely-used deep RL algorithms (e.g., Rainbow, PPO variants). We will design simplified, yet representative, analytical models or environments where the effect of a specific heuristic can be isolated. Using tools from optimization theory, statistical learning theory, and function approximation, we will formally analyze how these heuristics impact the learning dynamics, sample efficiency, or implicit regularization. The expected outcome is a set of theoretical results (e.g., convergence rates, sample complexity bounds under specific assumptions reflecting the heuristic's effect) explaining the observed empirical benefits, thereby providing a principled understanding and guiding future, theoretically-sound algorithm design.
