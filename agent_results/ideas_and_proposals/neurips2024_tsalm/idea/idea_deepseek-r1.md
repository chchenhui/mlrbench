**Title:** Cross-Modal Adaptation of Pretrained Language Models for Time Series Analysis  

**Motivation:** Leveraging pretrained language models (LLMs) for time series tasks offers a resource-efficient alternative to training foundation models from scratch, especially when labeled time series data is scarce. However, the effectiveness of adaptation strategies (e.g., prompting, fine-tuning) and their applicability across diverse domains (e.g., healthcare, finance) remains understudied, limiting their real-world adoption.  

**Main Idea:** This work proposes a systematic framework to adapt LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA) for time series forecasting and anomaly detection by converting numerical data into tokenized sequences or natural language descriptors (e.g., "sensor X rose sharply at time T"). We will compare adaptation methods such as lightweight fine-tuning, prefix-tuning, and instruction-based prompting, evaluating their performance against traditional time series models and domain-specific foundation models. The study will quantify trade-offs in accuracy, training/inference speed, and data efficiency across domains, while analyzing how LLMsâ€™ semantic reasoning enhances predictions when textual context (e.g., weather reports, clinical notes) is integrated. Expected outcomes include guidelines for optimal adaptation strategies and scenarios where LLM-based approaches outperform conventional models, enabling practical, low-cost deployment of large models for time series tasks.
