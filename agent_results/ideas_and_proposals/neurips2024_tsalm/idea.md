# Multimodal Attention Fusion for Enhanced Time Series Forecasting

## Motivation
Traditional time series forecasting models often rely solely on numerical data, ignoring valuable contextual information from other modalities like text, images, or categorical metadata. This limitation reduces forecasting accuracy, especially during anomalous events or regime changes that might be explained by external factors. As foundation models transform NLP and computer vision, there's an opportunity to leverage these pre-trained models to enhance time series analysis by incorporating multimodal information that provides crucial context about underlying system dynamics.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel architecture that fuses numerical time series data with contextual information from other modalities using a specialized attention mechanism. Our approach employs modality-specific encoders (including pre-trained transformers for text and vision) that process each input type separately, followed by a cross-modal attention module that learns to weight the importance of different information sources dynamically based on the forecasting context. The cross-attention layers allow the model to selectively focus on relevant external information during different forecasting scenarios, particularly during anomalous periods. The architecture includes an adaptive weighting mechanism that automatically adjusts the influence of each modality based on data quality and relevance. This approach maintains strong performance on standard forecasting scenarios while significantly enhancing accuracy during regime changes or external shocks by leveraging contextual signals from news, social media, images, or other relevant sources.
