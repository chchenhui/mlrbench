### Title: "Hybrid Deep Learning Models for Accurate and Robust Medical Image Segmentation"

### Motivation:
Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis, enabling precise identification of anatomical structures and pathologies. However, the complexity and variability of medical images pose significant challenges to current segmentation methods. Traditional deep learning models often struggle with robustness and accuracy, particularly in clinical settings where data variability is high. This research aims to address these challenges by developing hybrid deep learning models that combine the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer architectures to improve segmentation performance.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research will focus on developing hybrid deep learning models that leverage CNNs for local feature extraction and transformers for global context understanding. The methodology involves designing a multi-stage architecture where CNNs are used to capture local image details, and transformers are employed to integrate these local features into a global context. The hybrid model will be trained on large-scale medical image datasets and evaluated on diverse clinical datasets to ensure robustness and accuracy.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved segmentation accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.
- Enhanced ability to handle data variability and noise in medical images.
- Practical deployment of the model in clinical settings for improved diagnostic accuracy.

The potential impact of this research is significant, as it could lead to more reliable and accurate medical image segmentation tools, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing diagnostic errors.
