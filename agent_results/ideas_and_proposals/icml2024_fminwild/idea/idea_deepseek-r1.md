**Title:** Uncertainty-Aware Retrieval and Privacy Filters for Reliable Foundation Model Deployment  

**Motivation:** Foundation models (FMs) often produce unreliable outputs, such as hallucinations or privacy leaks, when faced with out-of-distribution queries. These failures erode trust and pose risks in critical domains like healthcare and finance. Addressing reliability and privacy in real-world deployments is essential to ensure FMs operate safely and responsibly.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a hybrid framework integrating *uncertainty-aware confidence scoring* and *privacy-sensitive prompting*. First, introduce a lightweight uncertainty estimator that triggers retrieval from domain-specific knowledge bases when model confidence falls below a threshold, reducing hallucinations by substituting uncertain generations with verified external information. Second, deploy a pretrained privacy filter that detects and anonymizes sensitive user inputs (e.g., personal identifiers) before processing, while also enforcing differential privacy during retrieval to prevent data leakage. The uncertainty component could leverage Bayesian neural networks or ensemble-based variance metrics, while the privacy module might use entity recognition models paired with token redaction. Expected outcomes include reduced hallucination rates and enhanced privacy preservation without significant computational overhead. This approach directly improves FM reliability in unpredictable scenarios and mitigates ethical risks, fostering safer adoption in high-stakes applications.
