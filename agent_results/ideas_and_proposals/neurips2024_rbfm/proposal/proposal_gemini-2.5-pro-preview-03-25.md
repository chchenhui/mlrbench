**Proactive Reliability and Sustainability in Multimodal Generative Models through Knowledge-Guided Pre-Training and Dynamic Curation**

## 2. Introduction

**Background:**
The rapid advancement of multimodal foundational models, integrating modalities like language, vision, audio, and video, has unlocked significant potential across diverse fields, notably in robotics, creative industries, and healthcare. Models like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models demonstrate remarkable generative capabilities. However, this progress is accompanied by critical challenges pertaining to their responsible design, deployment, and societal impact, as highlighted by the Workshop on Responsibly Building the Next Generation of Multimodal Foundational Models. A primary concern is the propensity of these models to generate unreliable or harmful outputs, such as factual inaccuracies ("hallucinations") in LLMs and biased or offensive content in T2I models (Bommasani et al., 2021). Furthermore, these models often inherit and amplify societal biases present in large-scale, uncurated training datasets, leading to fairness concerns. Security vulnerabilities, including susceptibility to adversarial and backdoor attacks, further compromise their trustworthiness.

Traditionally, efforts to mitigate these issues have been largely reactive, relying on post-hoc filtering, fine-tuning, or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) after the initial pre-training phase. While partially effective, these post-hoc measures are often insufficient, resource-intensive (requiring significant human labeling and computational overhead), and struggle to address problems deeply embedded within the model's core representations (Ganguli et al., 2022). This reactive cycle perpetuates the deployment of potentially flawed models and incurs substantial costs for remediation. Moreover, the pre-training phase itself demands vast computational resources and massive datasets, raising concerns about environmental sustainability and equitable access to developing these powerful technologies (Schwartz et al., 2020).

There is a growing consensus, echoed by the workshop's objectives, that proactive measures integrated directly into the model development lifecycle, particularly during pre-training, are essential. By embedding principles of reliability (factuality, fairness, safety) and sustainability (data and computation efficiency) from the outset, we can potentially break the cycle of reactive fixes and foster the development of inherently more trustworthy and efficient multimodal models.

**Problem Statement:**
Current pre-training paradigms for multimodal models often lack explicit mechanisms to ground representations in factual knowledge or enforce ethical constraints proactively. They primarily focus on learning correlations from web-scale data, which is inherently noisy, biased, and may contain harmful content. This lack of grounding contributes significantly to model unreliability (hallucinations, bias propagation) (Ji et al., 2023). Concurrently, the reliance on ever-larger datasets and compute budgets for pre-training presents a significant sustainability challenge.

**Proposed Research Idea:**
This research proposes a novel pre-training framework, **KnoWDyPre** (Knowledge-Guided and Dynamic Pre-training), designed to proactively enhance the reliability and sustainability of multimodal generative models. Our core idea is to integrate external knowledge sources and dynamic data management directly into the pre-training loop. We achieve this through two synergistic components:
1.  **Knowledge-Guided Contrastive Learning:** Leveraging a multimodal knowledge graph (KG), we introduce a contrastive learning objective that explicitly aligns cross-modal representations (e.g., image-text pairs) not only with each other but also with corresponding factual entities and relations in the KG. This grounding aims to reduce hallucinations and improve factual consistency.
2.  **Dynamic Dataset Curation with Adversarial Filtering:** We implement a continuous evaluation mechanism during pre-training using a "Knowledge Consistency Score" and ethical/bias classifiers. Samples that are deemed low-quality (inconsistent with knowledge), redundant, biased, or potentially harmful are dynamically down-weighted or pruned from the training set. This iterative refinement enhances data quality and efficiency, mitigating bias propagation and reducing computational load.

**Research Objectives:**
The primary objectives of this research are:
1.  To develop and implement the KnoWDyPre framework, integrating knowledge-guided contrastive learning and dynamic dataset curation into multimodal pre-training.
2.  To evaluate the effectiveness of KnoWDyPre in enhancing model reliability, specifically measuring reductions in factual hallucinations, mitigation of societal biases, and improved robustness against harmful content generation compared to baseline pre-training methods.
3.  To quantify the sustainability benefits of KnoWDyPre, assessing reductions in computational cost (e.g., FLOPs, training time) and data requirements achieved through dynamic curation.
4.  To investigate the impact of different KG structures (e.g., Wikidata, domain-specific KGs) and curation strategies on model performance and trustworthiness.
5.  To demonstrate the framework's applicability across different generative modalities (e.g., text-to-image, potentially visual question answering as a proxy for controlled generation).

**Significance:**
This research directly addresses the critical challenges outlined by the workshop. By proposing a *preemptive* approach integrated into pre-training, we aim to fundamentally improve the trustworthiness of multimodal models at their source. Success would represent a significant step towards:
*   **Enhanced Reliability:** Producing models that are more factually grounded, fair, and less prone to generating harmful content, crucial for deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and autonomous systems.
*   **Improved Sustainability:** Demonstrating a viable path towards reducing the immense data and computational footprint of large generative models, making their development more environmentally friendly and accessible.
*   **Advancing Responsible AI Principles:** Providing a concrete methodology for embedding responsibility directly into the model design process, moving beyond post-hoc fixes.
*   **Setting a Precedent:** Establishing a new paradigm for knowledge-driven, dynamically curated pre-training that could influence the development of future foundational models across various modalities.

This work builds upon recent efforts in knowledge-enhanced pre-training (Pan et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022; Perry et al., 2025) and dynamic data management (Anon., 2024), but uniquely synergizes these concepts within a unified framework focused on both reliability and sustainability from the pre-training stage itself.

## 3. Methodology

Our proposed research methodology involves the design, implementation, and rigorous evaluation of the KnoWDyPre framework.

**3.1 Framework Architecture:**
The KnoWDyPre framework integrates several key components into a standard multimodal pre-training pipeline (e.g., based on architectures like CLIP or BLIP):
*   **Multimodal Encoder:** A base architecture (e.g., ViT for images, Transformer for text) that encodes input modalities into shared or aligned embedding spaces.
*   **Multimodal Knowledge Graph (KG):** A structured knowledge repository containing entities, relations, and attributes, potentially linking textual concepts (e.g., from Wikidata) with corresponding visual exemplars (e.g., images associated with entities). We will explore using existing resources like Wikidata and potentially construct smaller, domain-specific multimodal KGs using curated image-text-entity datasets.
*   **Knowledge Encoder:** A module (e.g., graph neural network or simple embedding lookup) to encode KG elements (entities, relations) into the same embedding space as the multimodal encoder outputs. This builds on ideas from AKGP-LVLM (Perry et al., 2025).
*   **Knowledge-Guided Contrastive (KGC) Learning Module:** Implements a loss function encouraging alignment between multimodal inputs and relevant KG concepts.
*   **Knowledge Consistency Scorer:** Evaluates the alignment of intermediate model representations or generated outputs (if applicable during pre-training stages) with the KG. Inspired by Anon. (2024).
*   **Dynamic Dataset Curation Module:** Selects, filters, or re-weights training samples based on the consistency score, redundancy checks, and outputs from bias/harm detectors. Influenced by Anon. (2024, 2023).
*   **Adversarial Filtering Component:** Integrates classifiers or discriminators trained to identify biased or harmful content, providing a signal for the curation module or directly influencing the model's training objective. Based on Anon. (2023).

**3.2 Data Collection and Preparation:**
*   **Pre-training Data:** We will utilize large-scale, publicly available image-text datasets (e.g., CC12M, LAION-400M subsets) as the base corpus.
*   **Knowledge Graph Construction/Selection:** We will primarily leverage Wikidata, filtering relevant subgraphs and potentially augmenting it with visual information (e.g., linking entities to representative images from datasets like ImageNet or OpenImages). We will devise methods to automatically link entities mentioned in text captions to KG entities and associate corresponding images.
*   **Bias/Harm Datasets:** We will use datasets designed for fairness evaluation (e.g., FairFace, occupancy detection datasets with demographic labels) and potentially employ taxonomies of harm (e.g., Perspective API, HateCheck) to train auxiliary classifiers for the adversarial filtering component.
*   **Evaluation Datasets:** Standard benchmarks will be used for downstream task evaluation (e.g., MS-COCO, Flickr30k for image captioning/retrieval; VQAv2, OK-VQA, A-OKVJA for visual question answering focusing on knowledge; benchmark datasets for fairness like BiasBuster). We will also curate specific test sets designed to probe for factual hallucinations and harmful content generation.

**3.3 Algorithmic Steps:**

**Step 1: Initialization:** Initialize the multimodal encoder (parameters $\theta$), knowledge encoder (parameters $\phi$), and auxiliary classifiers (parameters $\psi$). Define the initial training dataset $D_0$.

**Step 2: Iterative Pre-training Loop (for $t=1$ to $T$ epochs/steps):**
    a.  **Sample Batch:** Sample a mini-batch $B_t = \{(v_i, c_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ from the current dataset $D_{t-1}$, where $v_i$ is an image and $c_i$ is its corresponding caption.
    b.  **Encode Inputs:** Obtain image embeddings $z_v = \text{Encoder}_v(v_i; \theta_v)$ and text embeddings $z_c = \text{Encoder}_c(c_i; \theta_c)$.
    c.  **Standard Loss:** Compute standard pre-training losses, e.g., Image-Text Contrastive (ITC) loss $L_{ITC}$ and potentially Image-Text Matching (ITM) or Masked Language Modeling (MLM) losses, depending on the base architecture. $$L_{ITC}(B_t) = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \log \frac{\exp(sim(z_{v_i}, z_{c_i})/\tau)}{\sum_{j=1}^N \exp(sim(z_{v_i}, z_{c_j})/\tau)} - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \log \frac{\exp(sim(z_{c_i}, z_{v_i})/\tau)}{\sum_{j=1}^N \exp(sim(z_{c_i}, z_{v_j})/\tau)}$$ where $sim$ is cosine similarity and $\tau$ is a temperature hyperparameter.
    d.  **Knowledge Grounding:**
        i.  **KG Linking:** For each pair $(v_i, c_i)$, identify relevant KG entities $E_i = \{\text{entity}_k\}$ mentioned or depicted. This might involve Named Entity Recognition (NER) on captions and potentially object detection/recognition on images linked to KG concepts.
        ii. **Encode Knowledge:** Obtain KG embeddings $z_k = \text{KnowledgeEncoder}(\text{entity}_k; \phi)$.
        iii. **KGC Loss:** Compute the Knowledge-Guided Contrastive loss $L_{KGC}$. This involves aligning $(z_v, z_c)$ pairs with their corresponding $z_k$. A possible formulation encourages the joint image-text representation $f(z_v, z_c)$ to be close to relevant knowledge embeddings $g(z_k)$ and distant from irrelevant ones $g(z_{k'})$ (inspired by Knowledge-CLIP, Pan et al., 2022):
            $$L_{KGC}(B_t, KG) = -\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k \in E_i} \log \frac{\exp(sim(f(z_{v_i}, z_{c_i}), g(z_k))/\tau')}{\sum_{k' \in E_i \cup \text{Neg}(i)} \exp(sim(f(z_{v_i}, z_{c_i}), g(z_{k'}))/\tau')}$$
            where $f, g$ are projection heads, $\tau'$ is temperature, and $\text{Neg}(i)$ are negative knowledge samples (e.g., entities from other batch items or randomly sampled).
    e.  **Adversarial Filtering Signal:** Compute a loss $L_{Adv}$ based on the output of bias/harm classifiers $C(\cdot; \psi)$ applied to model representations or potentially generated outputs (if applicable): $$L_{Adv}(B_t) = \text{Loss}_{\text{classifier}}(C(f(z_{v_i}, z_{c_i}); \psi), \text{target}_{\text{safe}})$$ This loss might be used to directly penalize the generator (if end-to-end generation is part of pre-training) or inform the curation module.
    f.  **Total Loss:** Compute the combined loss: $L_{total} = L_{standard} + \lambda_{KGC} L_{KGC} + \lambda_{Adv} L_{Adv}$ (where $L_{standard}$ includes $L_{ITC}$, etc.).
    g.  **Model Update:** Update model parameters $\theta, \phi$ using gradient descent on $L_{total}$. Update classifier parameters $\psi$ based on their specific objective (e.g., classifying known harmful examples).

**Step 3: Dynamic Dataset Curation (performed periodically, e.g., every $K$ steps):**
    a.  **Evaluate Subset:** Select a subset $S \subseteq D_{t-1}$ for evaluation.
    b.  **Compute Scores:** For each sample $(v_i, c_i) \in S$:
        *   **Knowledge Consistency Score ($S_{KC}$):** Measure the alignment between the current model's representation $f(z_{v_i}, z_{c_i})$ and linked KG entities $E_i$. High alignment yields a high score. $S_{KC}(i) = \text{mean}_{k \in E_i} sim(f(z_{v_i}, z_{c_i}), g(z_k))$.
        *   **Harm/Bias Score ($S_{H}$):** Use the trained classifiers $C(\cdot; \psi)$ to estimate the likelihood of the sample contributing to biased or harmful representations/outputs. $S_{H}(i) = C(f(z_{v_i}, z_{c_i}); \psi)$.
        *   **Redundancy Score ($S_{R}$):** Measure similarity to other samples already effectively learned (e.g., based on representation distance or loss value).
    c.  **Filter/Reweight:** Define thresholds or criteria $(\epsilon_{KC}, \epsilon_{H}, \epsilon_{R})$. Update the dataset $D_t$ by:
        *   Pruning samples where $S_{KC} < \epsilon_{KC}$ or $S_{H} > \epsilon_{H}$ or $S_{R} > \epsilon_{R}$.
        *   Alternatively, down-weighting samples based on these scores during sampling in Step 2a.
    d.  Update $D_t$ from $D_{t-1}$ based on the filtering/re-weighting strategy.

**Step 4: Repeat** steps 2 and 3 until convergence or a predefined budget is reached.

**3.4 Experimental Design:**

*   **Baselines:**
    1.  Standard pre-training (e.g., CLIP/BLIP) on the full dataset.
    2.  Standard pre-training + Post-hoc filtering/fine-tuning for safety/bias.
    3.  Knowledge-integration baseline (e.g., implementing a simplified Knowledge-CLIP or using publicly available checkpoints if possible).
    4.  Baseline with random data pruning (to isolate the effect of *informed* curation).
*   **Implementation Details:** We will likely adapt existing open-source multimodal pre-training frameworks (e.g., based on Hugging Face Transformers, OpenCLIP). We will specify choices for model size (e.g., ViT-B/32), KG processing details, hyperparameter values ($\tau, \tau', \lambda_{KGC}, \lambda_{Adv}, N, K$), and optimization settings.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Reliability:**
        *   *Factual Correctness:* Accuracy on knowledge-intensive VQA datasets (OK-VQA, A-OKVQA). Hallucination metrics like CHAIR (Hallucination Rate) / CHAIRi (Object IoU) for image captioning. Manual evaluation of factual consistency for a subset of generated outputs.
        *   *Fairness:* Bias metrics on datasets like FairFace (e.g., accuracy parity across demographic groups), SEAT-like association tests adapted for multimodal embeddings, evaluation on BiasBuster benchmark.
        *   *Safety/Harm:* Rate of generating harmful content (evaluated using Perspective API, trained classifiers, and potentially human annotation) on curated harmful prompts. Robustness to generating nonsensical/unsafe outputs on out-of-distribution or adversarial text prompts.
    *   **Sustainability:**
        *   *Computational Cost:* Total training FLOPs, GPU hours, wall-clock time.
        *   *Data Efficiency:* Percentage reduction in the final effective dataset size ($|D_T| / |D_0|$). Performance achieved with smaller data subsets.
    *   **Standard Performance:** Image-Text Retrieval (Recall@K on COCO/Flickr3k), Image Captioning (BLEU, CIDEr, SPICE on COCO), VQA accuracy (VQAv2).
    *   **Robustness (Exploratory):** Evaluate performance drop under benchmark adversarial attacks (e.g., PGD on text/image inputs) if feasible. Evaluate resilience to simple backdoor triggers if applicable to the pre-training setup.
*   **Ablation Studies:** We will systematically evaluate the contribution of each key component:
    1.  KnoWDyPre (Full system)
    2.  KnoWDyPre without Knowledge-Guided Contrastive Loss ($L_{KGC}=0$)
    3.  KnoWDyPre without Dynamic Dataset Curation (static dataset, only KGC loss)
    4.  KnoWDyPre without Adversarial Filtering ($L_{Adv}=0$, no harm score $S_H$)
    5.  Varying KG complexity (e.g., Wikidata vs. smaller KG).
    6.  Varying curation intensity (thresholds $\epsilon$).

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact

**Expected Outcomes:**
Based on our proposed methodology and related work, we anticipate the following outcomes:
1.  **Improved Reliability:** We expect models trained with KnoWDyPre to exhibit significantly lower rates of factual hallucination in tasks like image captioning and knowledge-based VQA (targeting a 15-25% reduction in hallucination metrics like CHAIR score or improvement in OK-VQA accuracy compared to baselines). We also anticipate measurable improvements in fairness metrics (e.g., reduced performance gaps across demographic groups) and a lower propensity to generate harmful or biased content when prompted appropriately (targeting a measurable decrease in harmful outputs detected by classifiers/human eval).
2.  **Enhanced Sustainability:** The dynamic dataset curation mechanism is expected to prune a substantial portion of the initial dataset (potentially 30-40% as hypothesized in the initial idea) by removing redundant, low-quality, or harmful samples. This should translate into a corresponding reduction in total computational cost (FLOPs/training time) required to reach comparable or better performance levels compared to training on the full dataset.
3.  **Comparable or Improved Standard Performance:** While prioritizing reliability and sustainability, we expect KnoWDyPre to maintain or potentially slightly improve performance on standard downstream tasks (retrieval, captioning, standard VQA) due to the enhanced quality of representations learned through knowledge grounding and cleaner data.
4.  **Demonstrated Effectiveness of Components:** Ablation studies will clarify the distinct contributions of knowledge grounding and dynamic curation, providing insights into their synergistic effects.
5.  **A Publicly Released Framework/Codebase:** We aim to release the code for the KnoWDyPre framework to facilitate reproducibility and further research by the community.

**Potential Limitations:**
*   The effectiveness might depend heavily on the quality and coverage of the Multimodal KG.
*   The computational overhead of KG linking and consistency scoring during pre-training needs careful optimization to ensure overall sustainability gains.
*   Defining and measuring "harm" comprehensively remains challenging and may require continuous refinement of the adversarial filtering component.
*   Scalability to extremely large models and datasets needs to be demonstrated.

**Impact:**
This research holds the potential for significant impact aligned with the goals of the workshop:
*   **Contribution to Responsible AI:** It offers a concrete, proactive methodology for building more reliable and fair multimodal models, addressing key ethical concerns at the foundational level.
*   **Practical Applications:** By yielding more trustworthy models, this work can accelerate the safe deployment of multimodal AI in critical sectors like autonomous driving (better scene understanding and prediction), healthcare (more reliable diagnostic assistance from medical images and text), education (factually accurate tutoring systems), and robotics (safer human-robot interaction).
*   **Promoting Sustainable AI:** By demonstrating significant reductions in data and computational requirements, this research contributes to the development of more sustainable AI practices, making advanced model development more accessible and environmentally conscious.
*   **Influencing Future Research:** KnoWDyPre could establish a new baseline for pre-training foundational models, encouraging further exploration into integrating diverse knowledge sources and dynamic, adaptive training procedures for enhancing both responsibility and efficiency. It directly addresses the need for novel design principles emphasizing preemptive measures.

In conclusion, the proposed KnoWDyPre framework represents a principled approach to tackle the pressing issues of reliability and sustainability in multimodal generative models. By embedding knowledge grounding and dynamic data curation within the pre-training phase, we aim to foster the development of the next generation of foundational models that are not only powerful but also demonstrably more trustworthy and efficient.
