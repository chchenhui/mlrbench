Title: Adaptive Uncertainty-Driven Data Curation for Reliable Multimodal Pretraining

Motivation:  
Large multimodal corpora often contain noisy or semantically mismatched text–image/video/audio pairs that foster hallucinations, unfair biases and misinformation in downstream models. Filtering noisy examples preemptively can boost reliability and reduce needless compute, addressing both ethical and sustainability goals.

Main Idea:  
We propose a two-stage, lightweight uncertainty-based curriculum that dynamically curates multimodal pretraining data. Stage 1 builds a small ensemble of compact multimodal encoders trained on a high-quality seed set to estimate alignment confidence for each text–visual/audio sample. Stage 2 iteratively filters out low-confidence pairs and reweights remaining examples to maximize semantic diversity. At each epoch, the ensemble is fine-tuned on newly vetted data, improving its uncertainty estimates. This closed-loop curation limits dataset size by 30–50% without sacrificing coverage. We evaluate generated models on hallucination metrics, fairness benchmarks and adversarial resilience, comparing them to baseline pretraining. Expected outcomes include significant reductions in resource consumption, lower hallucination rates and improved fairness. This approach establishes a preemptive, resource-efficient design principle for future responsible multimodal foundational models.
