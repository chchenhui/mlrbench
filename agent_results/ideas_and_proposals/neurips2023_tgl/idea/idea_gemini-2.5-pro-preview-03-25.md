**Title:** Interpretable Temporal Graph Attention for Early Anomaly Prediction

**Motivation:** While temporal graph networks excel at detecting anomalies, understanding *why* a particular event or node is flagged remains challenging. This lack of interpretability hinders trust and adoption, especially in critical domains like fraud detection or network security, where early and reliable warnings are essential.

**Main Idea:** We propose an interpretable temporal graph attention mechanism specifically designed for *early* anomaly prediction. The model will learn temporal node embeddings while simultaneously learning attention weights over historical node interactions and temporal snapshots. Critically, these attention weights will be constrained (e.g., via regularization or structural design) to highlight the minimal subgraph and temporal patterns most indicative of an impending anomaly. This allows not only for anomaly prediction *before* it fully manifests but also provides a rationale by identifying precursor events or interactions. Expected outcomes include improved early detection rates and actionable explanations for flagged anomalies on benchmark datasets.
