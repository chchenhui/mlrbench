# Comparative Probing for Representational Alignment Between Biological and Artificial Systems

## Motivation
Current metrics for representational alignment often rely on global similarity measures, which might mask critical differences in computational strategies. Understanding how neural networks and biological brains process information differently despite achieving similar outcomes is crucial for advancing AI safety, interpretability, and cognitive science. While current alignment metrics tell us if representations are similar, they rarely reveal why or how computational strategies differ, limiting our ability to systematically improve alignment where beneficial.

## Main Idea
I propose a framework that combines traditional alignment metrics with targeted probing techniques to perform comparative causal analysis of representations. This approach identifies both where representations align and where computational strategies diverge by: 1) using orthogonal probing classifiers to identify the informational subspaces that represent specific concepts in both systems; 2) employing targeted interventions (e.g., lesioning, ablation) to map causal dependencies between representational components; and 3) developing a taxonomy of alignment patterns that distinguish between surface-level and deep structural alignment. The method would create comprehensive alignment profiles rather than scalar metrics, revealing not just if systems align but how their computational strategies differ. This could enable targeted interventions to increase alignment in safety-critical components while maintaining beneficial diversity in computational approaches.
