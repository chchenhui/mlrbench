### 2. **Introduction**  

#### **Background**  
Generative models, such as diffusion models and GANs, have shown remarkable success in synthesizing medical images for data augmentation, anomaly detection, and training simulation. However, deploying these models in clinical settings poses significant risks: unrealistic or artifact-laden synthetic images could mislead diagnostic AI systems or clinicians, leading to incorrect diagnoses or treatment plans. Current quality assessment methods for synthetic medical images are either manual (reliant on expert radiologists) or automated but lacking interpretability. For instance, while anomaly detection frameworks like DIA (arXiv:2302.14696) and PHANES (arXiv:2303.08452) improve detection accuracy, they fail to provide actionable insights into *why* an image is flagged as unsafe. This gap limits trust in generative systems and hinders their real-world adoption.  

#### **Research Objectives**  
1. Develop **SAFEGEN**, a framework that combines anomaly detection with interpretable feedback to assess the safety and realism of synthetic medical images.  
2. Integrate state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques (e.g., diffusion models) with explainability tools (e.g., Grad-CAM, SHAP) to generate localized heatmaps highlighting unsafe regions.  
3. Validate SAFEGEN’s performance in detecting artifacts and its alignment with radiologist assessments across multiple modalities (MRI, CT).  
4. Establish standardized evaluation metrics for safety-critical generative models in medical imaging.  

#### **Significance**  
SAFEGEN addresses the urgent need for trustworthy generative AI in healthcare by:  
- Reducing risks of deploying flawed synthetic data in clinical workflows.  
- Providing clinicians and developers with interpretable insights to debug and refine generative models.  
- Advancing interdisciplinary research on safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration in high-stakes domains.

### 3. **Methodology**  

#### **Research Design**  
SAFEGEN comprises two core modules: **(1) Anomaly Detection** and **(2) Interpretable Feedback Generation** (Fig. 1).  

**Figure 1:** SAFEGEN workflow. Synthetic images are analyzed by an anomaly detector, and regions contributing to anomaly scores are highlighted via interpretability methods.

#### **Data Collection**  
- **Datasets**: Publicly available medical imaging datasets:  
  - **BraTS 2023**: Brain MRI scans with tumor annotations.  
  - **CheXpert**: Chest X-rays with pathology labels.  
  - **NIH Pancreas CT**: 3D abdominal CT scans.  
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Use pre-trained generative models (e.g., MONAI’s diffusion models, medXGAN) to synthesize images. Introduce controlled artifacts (e.g., motion blur, unrealistic textures) for evaluation.

#### **Anomaly Detection Module**  
Leverage a hybrid approach combining diffusion models and reconstruction-based autoencoders:  

1. **Diffusion Model Pre-training**: Train a diffusion model on real medical images to learn the data distribution $p(x)$. For a synthetic image $x_{\text{syn}}$, compute the anomaly score $S(x_{\text{syn}})$ as the negative log-likelihood of the diffusion process:  
   $$  
   S(x_{\text{syn}}) = -\log p_{\theta}(x_{\text{syn}} \mid x_{T}, \dots, x_0),  
   $$  
   where $x_T$ is the noised input and $\theta$ are diffusion model parameters.  

2. **Autoencoder Reconstruction**: Train a U-Net autoencoder on real images. Compute the pixel-wise reconstruction error $E(x_{\text{syn}})$:  
   $$  
   E(x_{\text{syn}}) = \| x_{\text{syn}} - D(E(x_{\text{syn}})) \|^2,  
   $$  
   where $E$ and $D$ are encoder and decoder networks.  

The final anomaly score is a weighted sum:  
$$  
S_{\text{final}} = \alpha S(x_{\text{syn}}) + (1-\alpha) E(x_{\text{syn}}).  
$$

#### **Interpretability Component**  
To localize anomalies, SAFEGEN uses:  
1. **Grad-CAM**: For diffusion models, compute gradient-based class activation maps (Grad-CAM) by backpropagating the anomaly score to the input space.  
2. **SHAP Values**: Apply KernelSHAP to attribute anomaly scores to image regions, optimizing:  
   $$  
   \phi_i = \arg \min_{\phi} \sum_{z \in Z} \left[ f(h_x(z)) - \sum_{j=1}^M \phi_j z_j \right]^2 \pi(z),  
   $$  
   where $f$ is the anomaly detector, $z$ is a binary mask, and $\pi(z)$ is a weighting kernel.  

Heatmaps are thresholded to highlight regions exceeding a safety tolerance $\tau$.

#### **Experimental Design**  
1. **Baselines**: Compare against PHANES (pseudo-healthy generation), DIA (diffusion-based anomaly detection), and medXGAN (interpretable GANs).  
2. **Evaluation Metrics**:  
   - **Detection Performance**: AUROC, F1-score for artifact detection.  
   - **Interpretability**: Dice score between SAFEGEN’s heatmaps and radiologist-annotated artifact regions.  
   - **Clinical Validation**: Survey 10 radiologists to rate SAFEGEN’s heatmaps for usefulness (5-point Likert scale).  
3. **Ablation Studies**: Test contributions of diffusion vs. autoencoder modules and Grad-CAM vs. SHAP.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

#### **Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Technical Contributions**:  
   - SAFEGEN framework outperforms existing methods in artifact detection (target: AUROC > 0.95 on BraTS).  
   - Heatmaps achieve >80% Dice score overlap with expert annotations.  
   - Open-source implementation integrated with the MONAI framework.  

2. **Clinical Impact**:  
   - Radiologists rate SAFEGEN’s feedback as “clinically actionable” (target: 4.5/5 average score).  
   - Guidelines for deploying generative models in compliance with FDA/CE safety standards.  

#### **Broader Impact**  
- **Safety-Critical AI**: Enable safer adoption of generative AI in healthcare, reducing risks of misdiagnosis.  
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Foster partnerships between ML researchers, clinicians, and regulators.  
- **Standardization**: Proposed metrics and workflows could inform regulatory frameworks for medical AI.

### 5. **Conclusion**  
SAFEGEN bridges the gap between generative AI innovation and clinical safety by providing interpretable, automated quality checks for synthetic medical images. By integrating anomaly detection with explainability, the framework empowers developers to refine models and clinicians to trust AI-generated data. This work aligns with the broader mission of deploying generative AI responsibly in high-stakes domains.
