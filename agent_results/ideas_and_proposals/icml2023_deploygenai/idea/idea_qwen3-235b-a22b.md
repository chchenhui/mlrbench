1. **Title:** Reliable and Interpretable Multimodal Generative AI for Personalized Medicine  
2. **Motivation:** Deploying generative AI in healthcare requires balancing innovation with trust. While multimodal models (e.g., combining imaging, clinical notes, genomics) can accelerate personalized treatment, their "black-box" nature hinders adoption. Clinicians demand interpretable outputs to validate decisions and robustness against adversarial or ambiguous inputs, especially where errors endanger lives. Existing methods lack granular, actionable explanations aligned with clinical knowledge, creating a critical gap in safe deployment.  
3. **Main Idea:** Propose a framework that integrates multimodal generative networks with concept-based interpretability and robustness guarantees. First, the model decomposes inputs into human-understandable concepts (e.g., tumor characteristics, gene markers) via a structured latent space, ensuring generations explicitly link to medical logic. Second, adversarial training with domain-specific constraints enforces robustness across noisy clinical data. Third, an attention-driven explanation module generates layer-wise visual or textual justifications (e.g., highlighting imaging regions influencing drug selection). Evaluation involves collaboration with clinicians to benchmark accuracy, explainability (e.g., user trust surveys), and robustness against real-world input shifts. This approach bridges the gap between high-performance generation and compliance with healthcare safety standards.
