## **1. Title: SAFEGEN: Interpretable Safety Validation for Generative Medical Imaging using Anomaly Detection and Explainable AI**

## **2. Introduction**

**Background:**
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly deep generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing realistic data across various domains (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Ho et al., 2020; Rombach et al., 2022). In medicine, these models offer transformative potential for tasks such as data augmentation to address data scarcity, harmonization across different scanners, synthesis of counterfactual images for clinical decision support, and providing diverse datasets for training robust diagnostic AI systems (Pinaya et al., 2023; Fontanella et al., 2023). The generation of synthetic medical images (e.g., Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-rays) could significantly accelerate research and development cycles while potentially mitigating patient privacy concerns associated with sharing real data.

However, the deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains like healthcare faces significant hurdles, as highlighted by the workshop's focus. A primary concern is **safety**: generative models may produce images containing subtle or overt artifacts, unrealistic anatomical structures, or fail to capture the true distribution of real medical data (Cohen et al., 2018; Mardani et al., 2019). These flaws can propagate errors, leading to misdiagnosis if used for training downstream AI models, or misleading clinicians if used directly for visualization or planning. Ensuring the fidelity, realism, and clinical plausibility of generated medical images is paramount before they can be safely integrated into clinical workflows or research pipelines.

Current methods for assessing the quality of generated medical images often rely on global image similarity metrics (e.g., Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS)), which may not capture fine-grained anatomical inconsistencies or clinically relevant artifacts. Manual inspection by expert radiologists is the gold standard but is time-consuming, expensive, and subjective, making it impractical for large-scale generated datasets. Furthermore, even when automated quality checks exist, they often lack **interpretability**. They might provide a general quality score but fail to pinpoint *why* an image is flagged as potentially problematic or *which specific regions* exhibit anomalies. This lack of transparency hinders developers' ability to diagnose and rectify failure modes in generative models and prevents clinicians from confidently verifying the trustworthiness of synthetic data. This gap aligns directly with the workshop's emphasis on deployment-critical features like Safety, Interpretability, Robustness, and the need for Human-facing evaluations.

**Research Objectives:**
This research proposes **SAFEGEN (Safety Assessment Framework for GEnerated medical images using interpretable detection Networks)**, a novel framework designed to automatically assess the safety and realism of synthetically generated medical images while providing interpretable, localized feedback. The primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop an Automated Anomaly Detection Module:** To design and train a deep learning model capable of distinguishing between real medical images and potentially unrealistic or artifact-ridden synthetic images at a patch or pixel level. This module will be trained primarily on real medical data to learn the distribution of normal, artifact-free anatomy and appearance.
2.  **Integrate an Interpretability Component:** To incorporate state-of-the-art explainable AI (XAI) techniques with the anomaly detection module. This component will generate visual explanations (e.g., saliency maps, heatmaps) highlighting the specific image regions and features that contribute most significantly to the anomaly score assigned by the detection module.
3.  **Provide Fine-Grained Safety Assessment:** To combine the anomaly score and the visual explanation into a comprehensive safety assessment report for each generated image, allowing users to understand not only *if* an image is potentially unsafe but also *where* and potentially *why*.
4.  **Validate SAFEGEN Rigorously:** To evaluate the framework's performance in detecting known synthetic artifacts and unrealistic generations across different medical imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MRI) and anatomical regions. Validation will include quantitative metrics and a human-facing evaluation involving radiologists to assess the clinical relevance and utility of the generated interpretations.

**Significance:**
SAFEGEN directly addresses critical challenges hindering the safe deployment of generative AI in medical imaging. By providing automated, interpretable safety checks, this research offers several significant contributions:

*   **Enhanced Safety and Trust:** SAFEGEN provides a systematic mechanism to vet synthetic medical images, reducing the risk of deploying flawed data that could compromise downstream AI model performance or clinical decisions. The interpretability aspect fosters trust by making the assessment process transparent.
*   **Improved Generative Model Development:** The interpretable feedback allows developers to gain deeper insights into the failure modes of their generative models (e.g., specific artifacts being generated, anatomical regions poorly represented), enabling more targeted model refinement and improvement.
*   **Facilitation of Clinical Validation:** Provides clinicians with a tool to efficiently review and gain confidence in the quality of large synthetic datasets before incorporating them into research or training, bridging the gap between AI development and clinical acceptance.
*   **Contribution to Responsible AI:** Aligns with the principles of trustworthy and responsible AI by explicitly focusing on safety, transparency, and human-centric evaluation in a high-impact domain.
*   **Advancement of Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Addresses key topics identified by the workshop, including Safety, Interpretability, Deployment Challenges, and Evaluation Methodologies, fostering dialogue between machine learning researchers, clinicians, and ethicists.

## **3. Methodology**

**3.1 Framework Overview:**
The proposed SAFEGEN framework consists of two core modules operating sequentially: (1) An Anomaly Detection Module (ADM) and (2) An Interpretability Module (IM). Given a synthetic medical image $x_{synth}$, the ADM first computes an anomaly score $S(x_{synth})$ indicating the likelihood that $x_{synth}$ deviates from the distribution of real training images. If $S(x_{synth})$ exceeds a predefined threshold $\tau$, the IM is invoked to generate an explanation map $E(x_{synth})$ highlighting the regions contributing to the high anomaly score.

    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**3.2 Data Collection and Preparation:**
*   **Real Data:** We will leverage large, publicly available medical imaging datasets of real scans to train the ADM. Examples include:
    *   Brain MRI: BraTS (Menze et al., 2015), ADNI (Mueller et al., 2005)
    *   Chest CT: LIDC-IDRI (Armato et al., 2011), TCIA archives
    *   Chest X-ray: CheXpert (Irvin et al., 2019), MIMIC-CXR (Johnson et al., 2019)
    We will initially focus on one modality (e.g., Brain MRI) for focused development and evaluation, before exploring cross-modality generalization. Preprocessing will involve standard steps like intensity normalization, registration (if applicable), and potentially patch extraction depending on the ADM architecture. Only images deemed high-quality and artifact-free by initial screening (or based on dataset annotations) will be used for training the 'normal' distribution. Ethical considerations regarding patient privacy will be strictly adhered to by using de-identified public datasets and following data usage agreements.
*   **Synthetic Data:** We will generate synthetic medical images using state-of-the-art generative models (e.g., Diffusion Models like DDPMs, Latent Diffusion Models; GANs like StyleGAN2-ADA) trained on the same real datasets. We will use models from recent literature and potentially train our own to create a diverse testbed. This data will be the input for evaluation of the SAFEGEN framework. We will also synthetically introduce known artifacts (e.g., noise patterns, adversarial perturbations, common GAN artifacts like mode collapse signatures, unrealistic textures) into real images to create a controlled test set for evaluating artifact localization.

**3.3 Anomaly Detection Module (ADM):**
*   **Approach:** We propose using a reconstruction-based or likelihood-based anomaly detection approach, leveraging the power of deep generative models, inspired by recent successes in medical anomaly detection (Shi et al., 2023; Bercea et al., 2023, 2024; Fontanella et al., 2023). We will primarily explore Diffusion Models due to their high generation quality and strong performance in unsupervised anomaly detection.
*   **Diffusion Model Approach:**
    1.  **Training:** Train a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) or a variant (e.g., DDIM for faster sampling) exclusively on high-quality, presumably 'normal' (anomaly-free) real medical images from the chosen dataset (e.g., healthy brain MRIs). The model learns the forward diffusion process (adding noise) $q(x_t | x_{t-1})$ and aims to approximate the reverse denoising process $p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t)$ using a neural network $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)$. The objective function is typically a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood, often simplified to minimizing the noise prediction error:
        $$L_{DM}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \epsilon} \left[ || \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}\epsilon, t) ||^2 \right]$$
        where $x_0$ is a real image, $t$ is a timestep, $\epsilon$ is sampled noise, and $\bar{\alpha}_t$ are noise schedule parameters.
    2.  **Inference (Anomaly Scoring):** For a given synthetic image $x_{synth}$, we can estimate its likelihood under the learned distribution or measure its reconstruction error after undergoing a diffusion-denoising process. A common approach is to add noise to $x_{synth}$ for $T'$ steps (where $T' < T$, the total diffusion steps) and then denoise it back using the learned model $p_\theta$. The anomaly score $S(x_{synth})$ can be defined as the reconstruction error (e.g., Mean Squared Error or L1 distance) between the original $x_{synth}$ and its denoised version $x'_{synth}$:
        $$S(x_{synth}) = || x_{synth} - x'_{synth} ||_p$$
        Alternatively, stochastic methods like diffusion likelihood scores (score-based functions) or pseudo-likelihood estimates derived from the denoising process can be used (Bercea et al., 2024). Images that deviate significantly from the learned distribution of real data are expected to have higher reconstruction errors or lower likelihood scores.
*   **Alternative (GAN/AE-based):** As a potential comparison, we could train an Autoencoder (AE) or a GAN (like AnoGAN) on the real 'normal' data. Anomaly score would be derived from reconstruction error (AE) or a combination of reconstruction and discriminator loss (GAN).

**3.4 Interpretability Module (IM):**
*   **Goal:** To identify input regions in $x_{synth}$ responsible for the high anomaly score $S(x_{synth})$.
*   **Approach:** We will investigate and adapt XAI techniques suitable for the chosen ADM architecture.
    *   **Gradient-based Methods (if ADM uses differentiable components):** Techniques like Grad-CAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017) or its variants compute gradients of the output score (anomaly score $S$) with respect to intermediate feature maps. For diffusion models, gradients of the reconstruction error or likelihood score with respect to the input image $x_{synth}$ or intermediate denoising steps can be computed and visualized. This requires careful adaptation as the diffusion process involves multiple steps. We could analyze gradients at specific critical timesteps $t$.
        $$E_{Grad}(x_{synth}) = \text{Visualize} \left( \left| \frac{\partial S(x_{synth})}{\partial x_{synth}} \right| \right) \quad \text{or} \quad \text{Visualize} \left( \text{AggregatedGradients}(\nabla_{A} S) \right)$$
        where $A$ represents activations at a chosen layer.
    *   **Perturbation-based Methods:** Techniques like LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) or SHAP (Lundberg & Lee, 2017) analyze the change in output score upon perturbing input regions. While potentially more model-agnostic, they can be computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional medical images. We could explore efficient approximations or apply them patch-wise. SHAP, mentioned in the literature review (Wang & Cao, 2024), provides feature attribution scores with theoretical grounding.
    *   **Diffusion Model Specific Methods:** Explore methods that leverage the diffusion process itself, such as analyzing attention maps within the U-Net architecture commonly used in diffusion models (if applicable), or analyzing the denoising path differences between real and synthetic images (similar in spirit to Fontanella et al., 2023 but for anomaly explanation).
*   **Output:** The IM will produce a heatmap $E(x_{synth})$ of the same dimensions as the input image, where intensity indicates the contribution of each pixel/region to the anomaly score. This visual map directly highlights suspicious areas.

**3.5 Experimental Design and Validation:**

*   **Datasets & Setup:** Use the datasets described in 3.2. Split real data into training (for ADM), validation (for hyperparameter tuning, threshold $\tau$ selection), and testing (for baseline comparison). Generate synthetic data using various models (e.g., DDPM, StyleGAN2-ADA, Latent Diffusion) trained on the training split.
*   **Task 1: Artifact Detection and Localization:**
    *   Create a test set by injecting known, localized artifacts (e.g., Gaussian noise patches, checkerboard patterns typical of GANs, simulated motion artifacts) into real test images.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   *Detection:* Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR) for classifying images as 'clean' vs. 'artifactual' based on the anomaly score $S(x_{synth})$.
        *   *Localization:* For images correctly flagged as anomalous, evaluate the overlap between the SAFEGEN explanation map $E(x_{synth})$ (thresholded) and the ground truth artifact mask using metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU) or the Pointing Game accuracy (does the peak of the explanation map fall within the GT mask?).
*   **Task 2: Realism Assessment of Generated Images:**
    *   Use SAFEGEN to evaluate images generated by different state-of-the-art models.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   *Quantitative Correlation:* Compute the anomaly score $S(x_{synth})$ for each synthetic image. Compare the distribution of scores for synthetic images vs. real test images. Evaluate if SAFEGEN scores correlate with global quality metrics like FID/IS calculated between generated batches and real data (though acknowledging FID/IS limitations).
        *   *Qualitative / Human-facing Evaluation:* Conduct a study with board-certified radiologists (e.g., N=3-5). Present them with a mix of real images and synthetic images (some deemed high-quality, some low-quality by SAFEGEN). For each image flagged by SAFEGEN ($S > \tau$):
            1.  Ask radiologists to rate the overall diagnostic quality/realism of the image (e.g., Likert scale 1-5).
            2.  Show them the SAFEGEN explanation map $E(x_{synth})$.
            3.  Ask them to rate the usefulness of the map in identifying potential issues (Likert scale 1-5).
            4.  Ask them to indicate whether the highlighted regions correspond to areas they themselves find suspicious or unrealistic.
            5.  Collect qualitative feedback on failure modes identified and the interpretability provided.
        *   *Correlation with Radiologist Scores:* Correlate the SAFEGEN anomaly scores $S(x_{synth})$ and the localization accuracy (if applicable) with radiologists' quality ratings and assessment of highlighted regions.
*   **Baselines:**
    *   Standard global quality metrics (FID, IS, LPIPS).
    *   ADM without the Interpretability Module (i.e., only anomaly score).
    *   Alternative anomaly detection methods (e.g., simple AE reconstruction error, Z-score on standard image features).
    *   Manual radiologist inspection (as a benchmark for quality assessment on a subset).
*   **Robustness Analysis:** Evaluate SAFEGEN's performance across different generative model architectures, varying levels of image realism/artifacts, and potentially different datasets/modalities (if time permits).
