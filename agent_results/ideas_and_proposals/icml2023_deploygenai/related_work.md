**2. Key Challenges**

1. **Interpretability of Anomaly Detection**: Ensuring that anomaly detection methods provide clear and understandable explanations for identified anomalies remains a significant challenge.

2. **Preservation of Healthy Tissue**: Developing models that can accurately modify or reconstruct pathological regions without altering healthy tissue is crucial for reliable anomaly detection.

3. **Security Against Tampering**: Protecting medical images from malicious alterations by generative models is essential to maintain data integrity and trust in medical diagnostics.

4. **Standardization and Reproducibility**: Establishing standardized frameworks and methodologies for generative models in medical imaging is necessary to ensure reproducibility and comparability of results.

5. **Generalization Across Modalities**: Creating models that can generalize across different medical imaging modalities and anatomical regions poses a challenge due to the variability in data characteristics.
