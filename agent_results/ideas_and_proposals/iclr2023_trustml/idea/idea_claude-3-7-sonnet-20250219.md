# Bridging the Gap: Privacy-Preserving Active Learning for Limited Trustworthy Data

## Motivation
Machine learning applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare face dual challenges: limited high-quality labeled data and privacy concerns. When datasets are scarce, models often underperform for minority groups and leak sensitive information. Traditional solutions address either data limitations (via active learning) or privacy concerns (via differential privacy), but rarely both simultaneously. This research addresses the critical intersection of data scarcity and privacy requirements, focusing on how computational and statistical limitations impact trustworthiness in sensitive applications.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel framework called Privacy-Preserving Active Learning (PPAL) that strategically acquires valuable training examples while maintaining privacy guarantees. Our approach dynamically balances informativeness and privacy risk during the query selection process, incorporating a novel privacy budget allocation strategy that adapts to the information content of each sample. The core innovation lies in our uncertainty-guided privacy mechanism that applies stronger privacy protection to sensitive or ambiguous examples while allowing more information extraction from less sensitive ones. We implement this through a modified acquisition function that jointly considers sample informativeness and privacy risk. PPAL promises to enable more trustworthy ML in resource-constrained environments by making efficient use of limited data and computation while maintaining privacy, particularly benefiting applications in healthcare, finance, and social services where both data limitations and privacy concerns are paramount.
