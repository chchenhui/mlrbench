**Title:** Cross-Modal Attention Fusion for Context-Aware Audio Generation from Video and Text

**Motivation:** Generating realistic audio often requires understanding context beyond a single modality like text. For instance, generating sound for a video needs visual grounding, while desired mood or specific sounds might be best described textually. Current models often struggle to effectively integrate such diverse inputs simultaneously.

**Main Idea:** We propose a generative audio model that conditions on both video frames and textual descriptions. The core idea is a cross-modal attention fusion mechanism. Video and text inputs are first processed by separate encoders (e.g., a pre-trained video model and a language model). Their outputs are then fed into a fusion module employing cross-attention layers, allowing textual features to attend to relevant visual features and vice-versa, creating a rich, fused context representation. This representation conditions an audio decoder (e.g., a diffusion model or transformer). We expect this approach to generate audio that is not only relevant to the text prompt but also temporally synchronized and contextually appropriate to the visual scene, leading to more immersive and accurate multimodal generation.
