# Adaptive Contextual Goal Generation for Lifelong Learning via Hierarchical Intrinsic Motivation

## 1. Introduction

### Background

The development of broad and flexible repertoires of knowledge and skills in humans is a remarkable achievement that has been shaped by intrinsic motivations (IM) over evolutionary time. Intrinsic motivations drive humans and other animals to seek "interesting" situations for their own sake, fostering exploratory behaviors that are essential for efficient learning (Singh et al., 2010). In the realm of artificial intelligence, intrinsically motivated learning, often referred to as curiosity-driven learning, has emerged as a promising approach to enable machines to autonomously explore complex environments and learn without relying on predefined learning signals (Oudeyer et al., 2007; Barto, 2013; Mirolli and Baldassarre, 2013; Schmidhuber, 2021).

However, current intrinsically motivated agents face significant challenges in generalizing across dynamic environments and sustaining long-term skill development due to rigid pre-defined goal spaces or static reward mechanisms. This limits their ability to autonomously adapt to novel contexts or repurpose learned skills creativelyâ€”a critical capability for real-world deployment. Addressing this gap requires methods that enable agents to dynamically align intrinsic goals with evolving environmental properties while balancing exploration and exploitation over time.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop an adaptive contextual goal generation framework for lifelong learning via hierarchical intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we aim to:

1. **Develop a hierarchical framework** where an agent learns to generate and switch intrinsic goals contextually through a meta-reinforcement learning architecture.
2. **Integrate incremental learning** by retaining past skills in a library and composing them for novel contexts via few-shot transfer.
3. **Validate the method** by testing generalization across procedurally generated tasks and comparing performance against static-goal baselines.
4. **Evaluate success metrics** including task coverage, adaptation speed, and skill reusability.

### Significance

This research addresses a critical gap in the field of artificial intelligence by developing methods that enable agents to autonomously adapt to dynamic environments and repurpose learned skills creatively. By integrating hierarchical intrinsic motivation with incremental learning and contextual goal generation, this approach could significantly advance the state-of-the-art in lifelong learning and open-ended autonomous systems. The proposed framework has the potential to bridge the gap between curiosity-driven exploration and practical real-world deployment, contributing to the broader goal of developing autonomous lifelong learning machines with the same abilities as humans.

## 2. Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed research involves the development and validation of an adaptive contextual goal generation framework for lifelong learning via hierarchical intrinsic motivation. The methodology comprises three main components:

1. **Skill-specific Policies**: At the lower level, skill-specific policies are trained using curiosity-driven rewards.
2. **Goal Generation Module**: At the meta-level, a goal-generation module adaptively selects high-level objectives by analyzing environmental statistics.
3. **Incremental Learning and Skill Retention**: The system integrates incremental learning by retaining past skills in a library and composing them for novel contexts via few-shot transfer.

### Data Collection

Data collection for this research will primarily involve procedurally generated tasks designed to test the agent's ability to generalize across dynamic environments. These tasks will cover a range of complexities and domains, such as 3D navigation, multi-object manipulation, and dynamic environment adaptation. The data will be used to train the skill-specific policies and validate the performance of the adaptive contextual goal generation framework.

### Algorithmic Steps

#### Skill-Specific Policies

1. **Curiosity-Driven Rewards**: Skill-specific policies are trained using curiosity-driven rewards, such as prediction error or information gain. These rewards encourage the agent to explore and learn new skills by minimizing the prediction error of its internal model (Oudeyer et al., 2007).
2. **Policy Training**: The skill-specific policies are trained using reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to maximize the cumulative reward.

#### Goal Generation Module

1. **Environmental Analysis**: The goal-generation module analyzes environmental statistics, such as sensor dimensionality, task complexity, or dynamical predictability, to adaptively select high-level objectives.
2. **Attention Mechanism**: An attention mechanism is employed to focus on the most relevant environmental features, allowing the agent to prioritize exploration or exploitation goals based on the context.
3. **Goal Selection**: The goal-generation module selects high-level objectives that align with the current environmental context, encouraging the agent to adapt its intrinsic goals dynamically.

#### Incremental Learning and Skill Retention

1. **Skill Library**: A skill library is maintained to store the learned skills and their corresponding policies. This library enables the agent to retain past skills and compose them for novel contexts.
2. **Few-Shot Transfer**: The agent can transfer learned skills to new tasks with minimal supervision by leveraging the skill library and applying few-shot learning techniques (Triantafillou et al., 2017).

### Experimental Design

The validation of the adaptive contextual goal generation framework will involve testing generalization across procedurally generated tasks and comparing performance against static-goal baselines. The experimental design will include the following steps:

1. **Task Generation**: Procedurally generated tasks will be created to test the agent's ability to generalize across dynamic environments. These tasks will cover a range of complexities and domains.
2. **Baseline Comparison**: The performance of the adaptive contextual goal generation framework will be compared against static-goal baselines, where the agent's intrinsic goals are predefined and do not adapt to the environmental context.
3. **Success Metrics**: The success of the framework will be evaluated using metrics such as task coverage, adaptation speed, and skill reusability. Task coverage measures the proportion of tasks the agent can successfully complete, adaptation speed measures the time it takes for the agent to adapt to new contexts, and skill reusability measures the agent's ability to transfer and repurpose learned skills.

### Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation of the adaptive contextual goal generation framework will be based on the following metrics:

1. **Task Coverage**: The proportion of tasks the agent can successfully complete.
2. **Adaptation Speed**: The time it takes for the agent to adapt to new contexts.
3. **Skill Reusability**: The agent's ability to transfer and repurpose learned skills.

These metrics will provide a comprehensive assessment of the framework's performance and its ability to enable lifelong learning and open-ended autonomous systems.
