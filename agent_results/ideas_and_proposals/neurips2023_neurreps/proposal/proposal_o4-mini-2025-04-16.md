Title  
Neural Geometry Preservation: A Unified Framework for Biological and Artificial Information Processing

1. Introduction  
Background  
Over the past decade, two parallel research streams—computational neuroscience and geometric deep learning—have independently converged on the insight that effective neural representations preserve the underlying geometric and topological structure of sensory and motor data. In neuroscience, head‐direction cells in insects, grid cells in mammalian entorhinal cortex, and low‐dimensional population manifolds in motor cortex all exhibit activity patterns that faithfully mirror the geometry of the represented variables (angular orientation, Euclidean space, limb kinematics). In deep learning, the subfield of Geometric Deep Learning achieves state-of-the-art performance by building equivariant and invariant architectures that respect group symmetries (e.g., rotations, translations) and non-Euclidean domains (graphs, manifolds, simplicial complexes) in vision, physical modeling, and language. Despite these advances, we lack a unified theoretical and experimental framework that (1) quantifies how well neural systems—biological or artificial—preserve geometry, (2) explains why such preservation arises from first principles, and (3) guides the design of next-generation neural network architectures and the interpretation of biological circuits.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal develops a formal framework called Neural Geometry Preservation (NGP) that addresses the following objectives:  
1. Define and validate metrics that quantify geometric and topological distortion introduced by a neural transformation.  
2. Prove optimal preservation strategies under constraints on model complexity, noise, and computational resources.  
3. Demonstrate empirical utility by applying NGP to (a) biological recordings—e.g., fly head‐direction circuits, rodent grid‐cell ensembles—and (b) artificial networks—e.g., convolutional, group‐equivariant, and graph‐based architectures—on synthetic and real tasks.  

Significance  
By unifying principles from Riemannian geometry, group theory, topological data analysis, and information theory, NGP will:  
• Reveal fundamental design principles underlying efficient biological information processing.  
• Inspire new neural network architectures with provable robustness, generalization, and sample efficiency.  
• Provide cross-domain metrics and benchmarks that facilitate comparisons between brains and machines.  
• Advance interpretability by linking quantitative distortion measures to empirical performance and neural coding efficiency.

2. Related Work & Gap Analysis  
• Geometric Deep Learning (Bronstein et al., 2023) establishes the theory of group convolutions, spectral graph methods, and gauge equivariance on manifolds. However, it rarely quantifies the residual geometric distortion incurred by each layer.  
• Topological Deep Learning (Pedersen et al., 2023) integrates persistent homology into loss functions, capturing global shape features but lacking local geometric fidelity metrics.  
• Neural Manifold Learning (Lu & Zhang, 2024) uses Riemannian metrics to guide representation learning but does not link to biological circuits or derive optimality proofs under resource constraints.  
• Simplicial k-Forms (Maggs et al., 2023) and Equivariant Neural Fields (Wessels et al., 2024) propose novel architectures on higher-order topological domains, yet offer limited theoretical analysis of their distortion bounds.  
• Geometric Meta-Learning via Ricci Flow (Lei & Baehr, 2025) provides a thermodynamic view of parameter‐space geometry adaptation but does not address data‐space geometry preservation or biological plausibility.  
• Neuroscience studies (e.g., fly head‐direction, rodent grid cells, Churchland et al. on motor manifolds) demonstrate preserved geometric structure but lack a unifying quantitative theory.  

Gap Analysis  
Existing work is either (1) highly theoretical without empirical cross-domain validation, (2) empirically rich but lacking formal distortion metrics and optimality proofs, or (3) focused on artificial networks without grounding in biology. NGP fills this gap by integrating precise distortion measures, provable optimality under constraints, and experiments spanning biological and artificial systems.

3. Methodology  
Our methodology comprises three interlocking components: (A) Metric Development, (B) Theoretical Analysis, and (C) Experimental Validation.

A. Metric Development  
We define three families of metrics to quantify geometric/topological distortion introduced by a mapping $f:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Y}$, where $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are data manifolds (biological neural manifolds or latent spaces of artificial nets).  
1. Local Geodesic Distortion (LGD)  
   For a finite sample $\{x_i\}\subset\mathcal{X}$, let $d_{\mathcal{X}}(x_i,x_j)$ denote geodesic distance on $\mathcal{X}$ (approximated via graph‐based shortest paths). Define  
   $$E_{\rm LGD} = \frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{i,j}\bigl|\,d_{\mathcal{X}}(x_i,x_j) \;-\; d_{\mathcal{Y}}\bigl(f(x_i),f(x_j)\bigr)\bigr|.$$  
2. Topological Persistence Error (TPE)  
   Compute persistence diagrams $\mathrm{PD}_k(\mathcal{X})$ and $\mathrm{PD}_k(f(\mathcal{X}))$ for homology dimension $k$. Define the bottleneck distance:  
   $$E_{\rm TPE} = W_\infty\bigl(\mathrm{PD}_k(\mathcal{X}),\,\mathrm{PD}_k(f(\mathcal{X}))\bigr).$$  
3. Group‐Equivariance Gap (GEG)  
   For a symmetry group $G$ acting on $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$, measure equivariance violation:  
   $$E_{\rm GEG} = \frac{1}{|G|\,N}\sum_{g\in G}\sum_{i=1}^N \bigl\|f\bigl(g\cdot x_i\bigr)-g\cdot f(x_i)\bigr\|_2.$$  

We will implement efficient estimators for these metrics using GPU‐accelerated graph algorithms (for $E_{\rm LGD}$), Ripser++ (for $E_{\rm TPE}$), and batched group actions (for $E_{\rm GEG}$).

B. Theoretical Analysis  
We formalize NGP as an optimization problem: given a capacity budget $C$ (e.g., number of parameters, layer widths) and noise level $\sigma$, find a mapping $f^*$ that minimizes a weighted sum of distortion metrics subject to resource constraints:  
$$ f^* = \arg\min_{f\in\mathcal{F}_C}\;\Bigl[\lambda_1E_{\rm LGD}(f)+\lambda_2E_{\rm TPE}(f)+\lambda_3E_{\rm GEG}(f)\Bigr]\quad\text{s.t.}\; \mathrm{Complexity}(f)\le C,\;\mathrm{Noise}(f)\le\sigma. $$  
Key theoretical goals:  
1. Prove existence of minimizers in rich function classes (e.g., RKHS, neural tangent kernels) via calculus of variations on manifolds.  
2. Derive closed‐form solutions or performance bounds when $\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}$ are homogeneous spaces of Lie groups $G/H$ (e.g., circles $S^1$, tori $T^2$). Show that equivariant linear maps achieve zero $E_{\rm LGD}$ and $E_{\rm GEG}$ when $G$ acts transitively.  
3. Establish trade‐off curves ("distortion–capacity frontiers") analogous to the Shannon rate–distortion function:  
   $$R(D)=\min_{f: E(f)\le D} \mathrm{Rate}(f),$$  
   where $E(f)$ aggregates the distortion metrics and Rate$(f)$ measures minimal code length.  

Proof Techniques  
• Use harmonic analysis on groups and Peter–Weyl theorem to characterize optimal equivariant maps.  
• Apply stability theorems in persistent homology (Cohen-Steiner et al.) to bound $E_{\rm TPE}$.  
• Adapt rate–distortion theory to manifold‐valued signals by generalizing the notion of differential entropy via Riemannian volume elements.

C. Experimental Validation  
We will validate NGP across three domains:

1. Synthetic Geometric Tasks  
   • Datasets: Uniform point clouds on circles ($S^1$), spheres ($S^2$), and tori ($T^2$)  
   • Architectures:  
     – Standard MLPs and CNNs  
     – Group‐Equivariant CNNs (Cohen & Welling, 2016) for $G\in\{\mathrm{SO}(2),\mathrm{SO}(3)\}$  
     – Graph neural networks on triangulated meshes  
   • Protocol: Train each model to reconstruct input coordinates under additive noise, measure $E_{\rm LGD},E_{\rm TPE},E_{\rm GEG}$ as functions of capacity and noise. Plot distortion–capacity frontiers.

2. Biological Neuroscience Data  
   • Fly head-direction network recordings (e.g., data from Seelig & Jayaraman)  
   • Rodent entorhinal grid-cell ensemble recordings  
   • Motor cortex population activity during reach tasks (Churchland et al.)  
   Protocol:  
     – Preprocess spike trains into low‐dimensional embeddings via PCA and Gaussian process factor analysis.  
     – Estimate neural manifold $\mathcal{X}$ and successive processing stages (e.g., upstream projection).  
     – Compute NGP metrics to quantify how well geometry is preserved across synaptic transformations or time.  
   Hypotheses: Biological circuits operate near the theoretical distortion–capacity frontier; equivariance gaps $E_{\rm GEG}$ are minimized for natural symmetries (e.g., rotations in head‐direction cells).

3. Downstream Application:  
   • Design a novel NGP‐regularized neural network for 3D object classification under rotations.  
   • Integrate a loss term $\lambda_3E_{\rm GEG}$ into the standard cross‐entropy objective.  
   • Evaluate on ModelNet40 and compare accuracy, sample efficiency, and robustness to unseen orientations against baselines.

Evaluation Metrics  
– Reconstruction error (MSE)  
– Classification accuracy under group transformations  
– Distortion metrics ($E_{\rm LGD},E_{\rm TPE},E_{\rm GEG}$)  
– Sample complexity (performance vs. number of training examples)  
– Robustness to adversarial or out‐of‐distribution geometric perturbations

Broader Impact  
NGP has the potential to transform both computational neuroscience and deep learning by:  
• Uncovering universal design principles of neural information processing that transcend substrate (biological vs. artificial).  
• Informing the design of next‐generation neural architectures that are more sample efficient, robust to distribution shifts, and interpretable thanks to explicit distortion controls.  
• Providing a common quantitative language—distortion metrics and capacity frontiers—that fosters cross‐disciplinary collaboration.  
• Facilitating advances in robotics (equivariant world models), vision (rotation‐robust recognition), language (syntax trees as manifolds), and neuroscience (mechanistic interpretability of circuits).  

By marrying rich theoretical analysis with extensive empirical evaluation across domains, the Neural Geometry Preservation framework promises to reveal deep, substrate‐agnostic principles of cognition and guide the development of more powerful and explainable neural systems.
