**Title:** Dynamic Equivariant Neural Manifolds for Adaptive Robotic Control  

**Motivation:** Robotic systems operate in dynamic environments where sensorimotor tasks require real-time adaptation to symmetries (e.g., rotational invariance in grasping) and temporal changes. Current neural models often handle dynamics and symmetry separately, limiting efficiency and interpretability. Bridging geometric structure with temporal evolution in neural representations could mirror biological adaptability while enhancing robustness in artificial systems.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a framework that unifies equivariant neural networks with dynamic manifold learning. By embedding symmetry constraints (via Lie group representations) into Neural ODEs, we enforce geometry preservation in latent state trajectories. The model learns task-specific invariant features while evolving representations along a manifold governed by differential equations. For robotics, this enables grasping policies that generalize across object orientations (rotational symmetry) and adapt to perturbations (dynamics). Outcomes include improved sample efficiency in sim-to-real tasks, interpretable latent dynamics, and theoretical guarantees on stability. Impact spans adaptive robotics, neural data analysis (e.g., tracking motor cortex dynamics), and geometrically consistent generative models.
