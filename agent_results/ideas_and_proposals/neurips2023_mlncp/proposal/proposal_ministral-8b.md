### Title: Physics-Informed Neural Architectures for Robust Training on Noisy Analog Hardware

### Introduction

#### Background

Digital computing is approaching fundamental limits and faces serious challenges in terms of scalability, performance, and sustainability. At the same time, the rapid growth of generative AI is fueling an explosion in compute demand. Traditional digital hardware is struggling to keep up with the demands of modern machine learning models. In response, there is a growing need to explore non-traditional computing paradigms such as analog and neuromorphic hardware. These hardware technologies offer energy-efficient alternatives but are limited by inherent noise, device mismatch, and reduced bit-depth. Most machine learning models, optimized for deterministic digital hardware, fail in these environments.

#### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop hybrid training paradigms that co-design neural networks with analog hardware constraints. By embedding physical noise models into the forward and backward passes during training, we aim to create models that can tolerate and exploit the noise characteristics of analog hardware. The specific goals include:

1. Developing "stochastic residual layers" that adaptively model hardware noise as probabilistic perturbations, allowing gradients to propagate through noise-aware pathways.
2. Combining this with a physics-informed loss term that regularizes weight updates to match hardware-achievable dynamics, such as asymmetric activation functions and limited bit-depth.
3. Training these models on physical hardware in the loop or via differentiable surrogate models of analog accelerators.
4. Evaluating the performance of these models on standard benchmarks to demonstrate improvements in accuracy and robustness compared to digital baselines.

#### Significance

Achieving the objectives of this research will significantly contribute to the field by:

1. Enabling efficient training of emerging model classes like energy-based models on analog accelerators, where noise itself could serve as a free source of regularization.
2. Reducing reliance on high-precision computation, which is energy-intensive and resource-hungry.
3. Aiding the deployment of compute-hungry generative AI in low-power edge devices, making AI more accessible and sustainable.

### Methodology

#### Data Collection

The data used for this research will consist of standard benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, Tiny ImageNet, and MNIST. These datasets will be used to train and evaluate the proposed hybrid training paradigm. Additionally, we will use synthetic data generated from differentiable surrogate models of analog accelerators to simulate the noise characteristics and other hardware imperfections.

#### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Noise Model Integration**:
   - Develop a noise model that captures the noise characteristics of the target analog hardware. This model will be integrated into the forward pass to simulate the effects of noise on the neural network outputs.

2. **Stochastic Residual Layers**:
   - Introduce stochastic residual layers that adaptively model hardware noise as probabilistic perturbations. These layers will be incorporated into the neural network architecture to allow gradients to propagate through noise-aware pathways.

3. **Physics-Informed Loss Term**:
   - Incorporate a physics-informed loss term that regularizes weight updates to match hardware-achievable dynamics. This term will include constraints such as asymmetric activation functions and limited bit-depth.

4. **Training Procedure**:
   - Train the neural network using the integrated noise model, stochastic residual layers, and physics-informed loss term. The training will be performed on physical hardware in the loop or via differentiable surrogate models of analog accelerators.

#### Mathematical Formulations

Let $x$ be the input to the neural network, and $f(x)$ be the output. The forward pass with noise can be represented as:

$$y = f(x) + \epsilon,$$

where $\epsilon$ is the noise term. The stochastic residual layer can be modeled as:

$$r = \epsilon + \text{ReLU}(x),$$

where $\text{ReLU}(x)$ is the rectified linear unit activation function. The physics-informed loss term can be defined as:

$$\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ \frac{1}{2} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \right| \right],$$

where $N$ is the number of samples, $\hat{y}_i$ is the ground truth output, and $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter.

#### Experimental Design

The experimental design will involve training the proposed hybrid neural network on the benchmark datasets and comparing its performance with digital baselines. The evaluation metrics will include:

1. **Accuracy**: Measured on standard classification benchmarks.
2. **Robustness**: Evaluated by measuring the model's performance under varying noise conditions.
3. **Energy Efficiency**: Assessed by comparing the energy consumption of the hybrid model with digital baselines.

### Expected Outcomes & Impact

#### Expected Outcomes

1. **Improved Model Accuracy**: The proposed hybrid training paradigm is expected to achieve comparable accuracy to digital baselines at lower precision.
2. **Enhanced Robustness**: Models trained using the hybrid paradigm are expected to exhibit greater resilience to hardware non-idealities without post-training quantization.
3. **Efficient Training of Emerging Model Classes**: The proposed approach will enable efficient training of energy-based models and other model classes that have been limited by compute resources on analog accelerators.

#### Impact

1. **Reduced Reliance on High-Precision Computation**: By developing models that can tolerate and exploit noise, this research will contribute to reducing the reliance on high-precision computation, which is energy-intensive and resource-hungry.
2. **Deployment of AI in Low-Power Edge Devices**: The proposed hybrid training paradigm will aid in the deployment of compute-hungry generative AI in low-power edge devices, making AI more accessible and sustainable.
3. **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration**: This research aims to foster collaboration between machine learning researchers and experts in alternative computation fields, leading to the development of more efficient and sustainable AI systems.
