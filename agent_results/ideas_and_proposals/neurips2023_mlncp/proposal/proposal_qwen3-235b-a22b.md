# Physics-Informed Neural Architectures for Robust Training on Noisy Analog Hardware  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Digital computing is reaching fundamental limitations in scalability, power efficiency, and sustainability, while generative AI demands exponential growth in compute resources. Analog and neuromorphic computing platforms, such as memristor-based accelerators and optical processors, offer promising avenues for energy-efficient machine learning (ML) due to their inherent parallelism and low-power operation. However, these systems suffer from significant challenges including device mismatch, stochastic noise, limited bit-depth precision, and nonlinear activation dynamics. Traditional neural networks, optimized for deterministic digital architectures, often fail catastrophically when deployed on such hardware without extensive post-training quantization or calibration.  

Recent studies (e.g., *Wang et al., 2025*; *Zhou et al., 2020*) demonstrate that explicit modeling of analog hardware non-idealities during training can improve robustness. Physics-informed and noise-aware training strategies (e.g., *White et al., 2023*; *Black et al., 2024*) show potential for aligning neural architectures with hardware constraints. However, existing methods primarily focus on mitigating noise passively rather than exploiting it as a computational resource. Furthermore, co-designing models and hardware in a unified framework remains underexplored, especially for emerging paradigms like energy-based models and deep equilibrium networks (*Rachel et al., 2025*).  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop **physics-informed neural architectures** that are intrinsically robust to analog hardware imperfections by:  
1. Embedding *stochastic residual layers* to model hardware noise as learnable probabilistic perturbations during forward and backward passes.  
2. Introducing a **physics-informed loss function** that regularizes weight updates to align with hardware constraints (e.g., asymmetric activations, low bit-depth).  
3. Training using differentiable surrogate models of analog hardware, co-simulated with neural networks, or direct in-the-loop optimization on physical systems.  

The ultimate goal is to achieve **comparable accuracy to digital baselines at lower precision** while eliminating the need for post hoc quantization and enabling novel applications such as energy-based models on analog systems.  

### Significance  
This work addresses two critical gaps in ML and hardware co-design:  
1. **Bridging the gap between analog compute potential and algorithmic resilience**: By actively exploiting noise as a form of regularization (e.g., *Rachel et al., 2025*), the proposed approach could transform hardware limitations into advantages.  
2. **Enabling energy-efficient training of emerging models**: Energy-based models, which are training-intensive due to their reliance on iterative solvers, may benefit from analog accelerators' natural compatibility with physics-based computations.  
3. **Reducing reliance on high-precision arithmetic**: Achieving accuracy targets at 4–8 bit precision (vs. current 16+ bits) would directly address the sustainability challenges of generative AI in edge devices.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Physics-Informed Neural Architecture Design  

#### Stochastic Residual Layers  
To model hardware noise as an intrinsic component of neural computation, we propose **stochastic residual layers** that decompose activations into noise-aware and nominal subspaces. Given a traditional residual block:  
$$ y = x + \mathcal{F}(x, W), $$  
we introduce a **noise-aware stochastic residual** formulation:  
$$ y = \mathcal{F}(x, W) + \epsilon \circ \mathcal{H}(x, W), $$  
where:  
- $\mathcal{F}(\cdot)$ is the nominal subnetwork (e.g., affine transform + ReLU),  
- $\mathcal{H}(\cdot)$ models hardware-induced perturbations as a learnable function parameterized by weights $W$,  
- $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)$ represents Gaussian noise calibrated to hardware measurements (e.g., from memristor arrays or analog accelerators),  
- $\circ$ denotes element-wise multiplication.  

This design allows gradients to flow through both the nominal path ($\mathcal{F}$) and the noise-aware path ($\mathcal{H}$), enabling the network to learn adaptive noise tolerance.  

#### Asymmetric Activation Functions  
Inspired by *White et al. (2023)*, we replace symmetric activations (e.g., ReLU) with hardware-informed asymmetric functions such as the **stretched exponential** $f(x) = -\log(1 + ae^{-x})$, parameterized to match analog circuit responses (e.g., subthreshold MOS behavior).

### 2.2 Physics-Informed Loss Regularization  

To enforce alignment with hardware dynamics, we augment the standard task loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$ (e.g., cross-entropy) with a **physics-informed term**:  
$$ \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{noise}} + \gamma \mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}, $$  
where:  
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{noise}} = \mathbb{E}_{\epsilon}\left[ \text{KL}\left(q_{\theta}(W) \,\middle\|\, p(W) \right) \right]$: A KL-divergence regularization between the learned weight distribution $q_{\theta}(W)$ and a prior $p(W)$ derived from hardware noise statistics.  
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}} = \alpha \sum_t \left\| \mu_t^{\text{network}} - \mu_t^{\text{hardware}} \right\|_2^2 $: A term penalizing deviations between network activation statistics ($\mu_t^{\text{network}}$) and hardware-observed distributions ($\mu_t^{\text{hardware}}$) across layers $t$.  

Hyperparameters $\lambda$, $\gamma$, and $\alpha$ balance the trade-offs between task performance and hardware compatibility.

### 2.3 Differentiable Hardware Surrogates  

To address hardware variability without relying on real-time access to physical devices, we propose **differentiable surrogate models** that simulate analog computations with realistic noise profiles.  

#### Surrogate Architecture  
The surrogate $S(\cdot)$ emulates a full analog accelerator stack:  
1. **Weight quantization**: Simulates limited bit-depth (4–8 bits) via stochastic rounding.  
2. **Activation nonlinearity**: Applies hardware-measured transfer functions (e.g., from PCM devices).  
3. **Noise injection**: Models device mismatch and thermal noise using Gaussian or Poisson distributions calibrated to hardware data.  
4. **Crossbar non-idealities**: Incorporates crosstalk and row-wise voltage drops via matrix operations.  

Mathematically:  
$$ S(x, W) = \text{Quantize}(W) \cdot x + \epsilon_{\text{noise}} + C(x), $$  
where $C(x)$ represents crossbar-specific perturbations.  

#### Training Protocol  
- **Simulated hardware in the loop**: The network is trained end-to-end while alternating between the real hardware (when available) and the surrogate model.  
- **Progressive noise schedules**: Inspired by *Wang et al. (2025)*, dynamic noise amplification during training improves robustness under time-varying conditions:  
  $$ \sigma_t = \sigma_{\text{min}} + (\sigma_{\text{max}} - \sigma_{\text{min}}) \cdot \frac{t}{T}, $$  
  where $t$ is the training step and $T$ is the total steps.

### 2.4 Experimental Design  

#### Datasets and Baselines  
- **Datasets**: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 (for classification), and Tiny ImageNet (for scalability).  
- **Baselines**:  
  1. Digital baselines (e.g., ResNet-18).  
  2. Quantization-aware training (QAT) (e.g., *Wang et al., 2025*).  
  3. Noise injection without physics constraints (*Zhou et al., 2020*).  
  4. Prior hardware-informed designs (*Black et al., 2024*).  

#### Implementation Details  
- **Hardware platform**: IBM’s Analog AI Cloud (for empirical validation) and surrogate models for large-scale sweeps.  
- **Precision levels**: 4-bit (stochastic rounding), 8-bit (affine quantization).  
- **Noise levels**: 5%, 10%, 20% Gaussian noise on weights/activations.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Robustness**: Accuracy degradation under increasing noise.  
  - **Energy efficiency**: FLOPS/Watt (measured on hardware).  
  - **Calibration**: Jensen-Shannon divergence between learned and hardware activation distributions.  

#### Ablation Studies  
- **Component analysis**: Remove stochastic layers or physics-informed loss to assess individual impacts.  
- **Noise schedules**: Compare linear vs. exponential noise ramps.  
- **Surrogate accuracy**: Evaluate performance when training purely on surrogates vs. hardware-in-the-loop.
