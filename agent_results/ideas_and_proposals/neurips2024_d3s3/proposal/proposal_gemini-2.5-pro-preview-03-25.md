**1. Title:** **Conditional Neural Operators for Fast, Differentiable, and Uncertainty-Aware Probabilistic Inverse Modeling in Turbulent Flows**

**2. Introduction**

*   **Background:**
    Simulation plays an indispensable role across diverse scientific and engineering domains, enabling the exploration of complex phenomena, design optimization, and system control (Workshop Task Description). Turbulent flows, governed by the computationally demanding Navier-Stokes equations, are ubiquitous in areas ranging from aerodynamics and climate modeling to astrophysics and biomechanics. A critical challenge in these fields is the *inverse problem*: inferring unknown system parameters, initial conditions (ICs), or boundary conditions (BCs) from sparse, noisy observations of the system's state. Accurate and efficient solution of these inverse problems is vital for tasks like data assimilation in weather forecasting, non-invasive flow diagnostics, optimal control strategy design, and uncertainty quantification (UQ) in complex simulations.

    Traditional approaches often rely on iterative methods (e.g., variational data assimilation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo - MCMC) that require numerous computationally expensive evaluations of the forward simulator (PDE solver). This high cost severely limits their applicability, especially in high-dimensional parameter spaces typical of turbulent flows, or in scenarios demanding real-time inference. Furthermore, conventional methods often struggle with limited data availability and may provide only point estimates (e.g., Maximum A Posteriori - MAP) or Gaussian approximations of the posterior distribution, failing to capture complex, multi-modal uncertainties inherent in many physical systems.

    Recent advancements in machine learning (ML), particularly in the area of data-driven and differentiable simulations (Workshop Task Description), offer promising avenues to overcome these limitations. Neural operators, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) [Li et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2024], have demonstrated remarkable success in learning resolution-invariant solution operators for PDEs, acting as fast surrogates for traditional solvers. Their differentiability allows for gradient-based optimization and inverse problem solving via backpropagation. Concurrently, generative models like Normalizing Flows (NFs) [Rezende & Mohamed, 2015] and Diffusion Models [Ho et al., 2020; Haitsiukevich et al., 2024; Du et al., 2024] provide powerful frameworks for learning complex probability distributions, making them suitable for probabilistic inference and UQ. Integrating these techniques holds significant potential for tackling challenging inverse problems in physical systems [Oommen et al., 2024].

*   **Research Objectives:**
    This research aims to develop and validate a novel framework, the **Conditional Neural Operator (CNO)**, for efficient, accurate, and uncertainty-aware probabilistic inverse modeling, specifically targeting turbulent flow systems governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. The core idea is to **jointly learn** the forward PDE dynamics and the conditional posterior distribution of the input parameters (or fields) given sparse observations, leveraging the strengths of neural operators and conditional generative models.

    The primary objectives are:
    1.  **Develop the Conditional Neural Operator (CNO) Framework:** Design and implement a hybrid architecture combining a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) for surrogate forward modeling and a Conditional Normalizing Flow (cNF) for approximating the posterior distribution $p(\text{parameters} | \text{observations})$.
    2.  **End-to-End Training Strategy:** Formulate and implement an efficient training strategy based on amortized variational inference (AVI) to jointly optimize the FNO and cNF components using synthetically generated simulation data.
    3.  **Application to Turbulent Flow Inverse Problems:** Train and apply the CNO framework to solve inverse problems for benchmark turbulent flow scenarios (e.g., inferring initial velocity fields or viscosity parameters from sparse sensor measurements in 2D/3D Navier-Stokes simulations).
    4.  **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Rigorously evaluate the CNO's performance in terms of:
        *   **Accuracy:** Quality of posterior approximation compared to gold-standard methods (e.g., long-run MCMC on the true simulator).
        *   **Speed:** Computational cost for training and, critically, for inference (posterior sampling and evaluation).
        *   **Uncertainty Quantification:** Calibration and reliability of the predicted posterior distributions (capturing both epistemic and potentially aleatoric uncertainty).
        *   **Differentiability:** Utility of the framework for gradient-based downstream tasks (e.g., sensitivity analysis, optimal experimental design).
    5.  **Benchmarking:** Compare the CNO framework against relevant baselines, including traditional methods (MCMC) and potentially other deep learning approaches (e.g., MCMC on surrogates, separate inference networks, diffusion-based operator models).

*   **Significance:**
    This research directly addresses several key challenges highlighted in the literature review and the workshop themes:
    *   **High-Dimensional Inverse Problems & Computational Efficiency:** The CNO aims to provide near real-time posterior inference even for high-dimensional inputs, drastically reducing the computational bottleneck associated with traditional methods [Key Challenge 1, 5].
    *   **Probabilistic Inference & Uncertainty Quantification:** By explicitly modeling the posterior distribution using cNFs, the CNO offers a principled way to quantify uncertainties arising from sparse data (epistemic) and inherent system stochasticity (aleatoric, if modeled), addressing a critical need for reliable decision-making [Key Challenge 3; Workshop Topics: Probabilistic Inverse Problems, Probabilistic Simulation].
    *   **Differentiability for Downstream Tasks:** The end-to-end differentiability of the CNO framework enables seamless integration with gradient-based optimization for tasks like optimal control, design, or experimental design [Workshop Topics: Differentiable simulators].
    *   **Bridging the Sim-to-Real Gap:** While initially trained on synthetic data, the framework's ability to handle sparse observations and provide UQ is a step towards robust application in real-world scenarios where data is limited and noisy. Future extensions could incorporate transfer learning or physics-informed constraints to mitigate the sim-to-real gap [Key Challenge 4; Workshop Topics: Improving simulation accuracy].
    *   **Contribution to ML for Science:** This work contributes a novel deep learning architecture tailored for scientific inverse problems, combining operator learning and conditional generative modeling, relevant to the broader ML and scientific simulation communities [Workshop Topics: Neural surrogates, operator-valued models].

    Successfully developing the CNO framework would represent a significant advancement in simulation-based inference, offering a powerful tool for researchers and engineers working with complex physical systems like turbulent flows.

**3. Methodology**

*   **Problem Formulation:**
    Let $u \in \mathcal{U}$ represent the unknown input parameters or fields of a physical system (e.g., initial velocity field, boundary conditions, viscosity parameter in Navier-Stokes). Let $G: \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}$ be the forward simulation map (solving the PDE), mapping the input $u$ to the full system state $s \in \mathcal{S}$ over space and time. Let $\mathcal{O}: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ be an observation operator that extracts sparse measurements $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ from the full state $s$ (e.g., velocity measurements at specific sensor locations and times). The forward process is thus $y = \mathcal{O}(G(u)) + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ represents observation noise, often assumed Gaussian, $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$. The probabilistic inverse problem is to infer the posterior distribution $p(u|y)$ given observations $y$. Using Bayes' theorem:
    $$ p(u|y) = \frac{p(y|u) p(u)}{p(y)} \propto p(y|u) p(u) $$
    where $p(y|u) = \mathcal{N}(y | \mathcal{O}(G(u)), \sigma^2 I)$ is the likelihood and $p(u)$ is the prior distribution over the inputs. Direct evaluation of $p(u|y)$ is intractable due to the high cost of $G(u)$ and the high dimensionality of $u$.

*   **Conditional Neural Operator (CNO) Architecture:**
    We propose a CNO architecture comprising two main components trained jointly:

    1.  **Forward Surrogate Model (Fourier Neural Operator - FNO):** We use an FNO, denoted $\mathcal{G}_{\theta}: \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}$, parameterized by $\theta$, to approximate the true forward solver $G$. The FNO leverages Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to efficiently capture global dependencies and learns the mapping in function space, making it adept at modeling PDE solutions [Li et al., 2020]. The FNO architecture typically consists of:
        *   A lifting layer mapping the input function $u(x)$ to a higher-dimensional channel space $v_0(x)$.
        *   A sequence of $L$ Fourier layers, each performing:
            $$ v_{l+1}(x) = \sigma( W_l v_l(x) + (\mathcal{F}^{-1} \circ R_l \circ \mathcal{F}) (v_l)(x) ) $$
            where $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ are the FFT and inverse FFT, $R_l$ is a linear transform acting on the Fourier modes (typically truncating high frequencies), $W_l$ is a local linear transform (e.g., 1x1 convolution), and $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function (e.g., GeLU).
        *   A projection layer mapping the final hidden representation $v_L(x)$ back to the solution space $\mathcal{S}$.
        The FNO provides a fast, differentiable approximation $\mathcal{G}_{\theta}(u) \approx G(u)$.

    2.  **Approximate Posterior Model (Conditional Normalizing Flow - cNF):** We model the target posterior $p(u|y)$ using a conditional normalizing flow, $q_{\phi}(u|y)$, parameterized by $\phi$. A normalizing flow transforms a simple base distribution (e.g., standard Gaussian $p_Z(z) = \mathcal{N}(z|0, I)$) into a complex target distribution via an invertible mapping $f_{\phi}(\cdot; y): \mathcal{Z} \rightarrow \mathcal{U}$, where the mapping $f_{\phi}$ is conditioned on the observation $y$. The density is computed using the change of variables formula:
        $$ q_{\phi}(u|y) = p_Z(f_{\phi}^{-1}(u; y)) \left| \det \left( \frac{\partial f_{\phi}^{-1}(u; y)}{\partial u} \right) \right| $$
        We will use a flexible NF architecture, such as Conditional RealNVP [Dinh et al., 2017] or Conditional Glow [Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018], which allow for efficient computation of both the forward mapping $u = f_{\phi}(z; y)$ (for sampling) and the inverse mapping $z = f_{\phi}^{-1}(u; y)$ along with its Jacobian determinant (for density evaluation). The conditioning $y$ will be incorporated into the affine coupling layers of the flow (e.g., by processing $y$ with a small neural network whose output determines the scale and shift parameters).

*   **Training via Amortized Variational Inference (AVI):**
    We train the parameters $\theta$ (FNO) and $\phi$ (cNF) jointly by maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) over a dataset of simulated input-observation pairs $\mathcal{D} = \{(u_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$. The objective for a single pair $(u, y)$ is:
    $$ \mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; u, y) = \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_Z} \left[ \log p(y | f_{\phi}(z; y)) \right] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_Z} \left[ \log p(f_{\phi}(z; y)) - \log q_{\phi}(f_{\phi}(z; y)|y) \right] $$
    The first term is the expected reconstruction log-likelihood, and the second term is the negative KL divergence between the approximate posterior $q_{\phi}(u|y)$ and the prior $p(u)$. Crucially, we approximate the true likelihood $p(y|u)$ using the FNO surrogate $\mathcal{G}_{\theta}$:
    $$ \log p(y | u) \approx \log \hat{p}_{\theta}(y|u) = -\frac{1}{2\sigma_{\text{obs}}^2} \| y - \mathcal{O}(\mathcal{G}_{\theta}(u)) \|^2_2 + \text{const} $$
    where $\sigma_{\text{obs}}^2$ is the observation noise variance (can be known or learned). Substituting this and the NF density formula into the ELBO, we get:
    $$ \mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; u, y) \approx \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_Z} \left[ -\frac{1}{2\sigma_{\text{obs}}^2} \| y - \mathcal{O}(\mathcal{G}_{\theta}(f_{\phi}(z; y))) \|^2_2 + \log p(f_{\phi}(z; y)) - \log p_Z(z) - \log |\det J_{f_{\phi}}(z; y)| \right] $$
    where $J_{f_{\phi}}(z; y)$ is the Jacobian of $f_{\phi}$ w.r.t. $z$. This objective is maximized end-to-end using stochastic gradient ascent (e.g., Adam optimizer) by sampling $(u_i, y_i)$ pairs from the training dataset and base samples $z \sim p_Z$. The expectation is typically approximated using a single Monte Carlo sample per iteration.

*   **Data Collection and Generation:**
    We will generate synthetic data using high-fidelity CFD solvers (e.g., FEniCS, OpenFOAM, or specialized codes).
    1.  **Define Flow Scenarios:** Start with benchmark cases, e.g., 2D decaying turbulence (Kolmogorov flow) or 2D/3D flow past a cylinder, governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations:
        $$ \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v} = -\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f} $$
        $$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0 $$
        where $\mathbf{v}$ is velocity, $p$ is pressure, $\nu$ is kinematic viscosity, and $\mathbf{f}$ is forcing.
    2.  **Define Input Space $\mathcal{U}$ and Prior $p(u)$:** The input $u$ could be:
        *   The initial velocity field $\mathbf{v}(x, 0)$. A common prior is a Gaussian Process with a specific covariance kernel (e.g., squared exponential or Matérn) encoding smoothness assumptions.
        *   The viscosity parameter $\nu$. A simple prior could be Log-Normal or Uniform over a range.
        *   Boundary conditions parameters.
    3.  **Generate Input Samples:** Sample $u_i \sim p(u)$.
    4.  **Simulate Forward Dynamics:** For each $u_i$, solve the Navier-Stokes equations using a high-fidelity solver to obtain the full state trajectory $s_i = G(u_i)$.
    5.  **Generate Observations:** Apply the observation operator $\mathcal{O}$ (e.g., sampling velocity components at $K$ sparse locations $\{x_k\}_{k=1}^K$ at specific time points $T$) and add synthetic noise: $y_i = \mathcal{O}(s_i) + \epsilon_i$, where $\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\text{obs}}^2 I)$.
    6.  **Dataset Creation:** Create training, validation, and test sets $(\mathcal{D}_{\text{train}}, \mathcal{D}_{\text{val}}, \mathcal{D}_{\text{test}})$ of input-observation pairs $\{(u_i, y_i)\}$. Ensure diversity in flow regimes (e.g., varying Reynolds numbers implicitly via sampled $u_i$).

*   **Experimental Design and Validation:**
    1.  **Implementation Details:** Specify FNO architecture (layers, modes, width), cNF architecture (type, layers, conditioner network), optimizer (Adam), learning rate schedule, batch size, training epochs. Use standard ML libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow).
    2.  **Baselines:**
        *   **MCMC-True:** Run a standard MCMC algorithm (e.g., Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - HMC) using the *true* high-fidelity simulator $G$ to obtain "gold standard" posterior samples (computationally very expensive, feasible only for low-dim $u$ or a few test cases).
        *   **MCMC-FNO:** Run MCMC using the trained FNO surrogate $\mathcal{G}_{\theta}$ in place of $G$. This tests the quality of the surrogate but uses a separate inference algorithm.
        *   **Variational Inference (VI) with FNO:** Use standard VI (e.g., assuming a Gaussian posterior) with the FNO surrogate.
        *   **Alternative DL Methods:** If applicable, compare with recent diffusion-based probabilistic operators [Haitsiukevich et al., 2024] trained on the same task.
    3.  **Evaluation Tasks:**
        *   **Posterior Reconstruction:** For test cases where MCMC-True is feasible, compare the CNO posterior $q_{\phi}(u|y)$ with the MCMC samples using metrics like Wasserstein distance ($W_2$) between samples, comparison of moments (mean, variance), and visualization of marginal distributions.
        *   **Inference Speed:** Measure wall-clock time for generating $M$ posterior samples from $q_{\phi}(u|y)$ once trained. Compare with MCMC methods' runtime *per inference*. Measure CNO training time.
        *   **Uncertainty Quantification:**
            *   *Calibration:* Generate prediction intervals (e.g., 95% credible intervals) for quantities of interest derived from $u$ (e.g., average kinetic energy, velocity at specific points). Assess calibration using reliability diagrams and Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP). Check if the observed frequency of true values falling within the interval matches the nominal level.
            *   *Sharpness:* Evaluate the tightness of the prediction intervals.
        *   **Downstream Task Performance:**
            *   *Parameter Identification:* Quantify the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the mean of the CNO posterior $\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(u|y)}[u]$ and the ground truth $u_{\text{true}}$.
            *   *(Optional) Gradient Quality:* If feasible, use the gradients $\nabla_y u_{\text{sample}}$ (where $u_{\text{sample}} \sim q_{\phi}(u|y)$) for a simple optimal experimental design or sensitivity task and evaluate their usefulness compared to gradients obtained via adjoint methods on the surrogate or true simulator.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Accuracy:** $W_2$ distance, KL Divergence (approximated), MSE of posterior mean, visualization overlap.
    *   **Speed:** Training time (hours), Inference time per observation (milliseconds/seconds), Time to generate $M$ samples.
    *   **UQ:** PICP, Average Credible Interval Width, Reliability Diagrams (Expected Calibration Error - ECE).
    *   **Surrogate Quality (FNO component):** Relative $L_2$ error $\| G(u) - \mathcal{G}_{\theta}(u) \|_2 / \| G(u) \|_2$ on test data.
