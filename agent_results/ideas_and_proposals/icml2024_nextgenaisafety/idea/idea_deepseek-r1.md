**Title:** Context-Aware Knowledge Sanitization for Mitigating AI-Generated Dangerous Capabilities  

**Motivation:** As AI systems gain advanced knowledge synthesis abilities, they risk being exploited to generate harmful information (e.g., bioweapon designs). Current safeguards, like static filters, are brittle and lack nuance, often blocking legitimate research or failing to address context-specific risks. This research aims to develop adaptive safeguards that prevent misuse while preserving scientific utility.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a *context-aware sanitization framework* that dynamically evaluates user intent, domain context, and output implications. The system combines:  
1. **Intent Analysis:** A meta-model to classify user queries (e.g., distinguishing academic research from malicious intent) using behavioral patterns and linguistic cues.  
2. **Content Redaction:** A diffusion-based generator trained to omit sensitive details (e.g., chemical synthesis steps) unless the user has verified credentials.  
3. **Adversarial Reinforcement Learning:** Fine-tune models using reward signals that penalize harmful outputs while maintaining helpfulness in safe domains.  

Expected outcomes include reduced generation of high-risk content (measured via red-teaming benchmarks) with minimal false positives in academic contexts. The impact would enable safer deployment of general-purpose AI in research, balancing innovation with proactive risk mitigation.
