**Research Proposal: Dynamic Risk-Adaptive Filtering for Dangerous-Capability Queries**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
The rapid advancement of general-purpose AI systems has introduced unprecedented capabilities in knowledge generation and problem-solving. However, these systems risk enabling malicious actors to exploit sensitive information, such as methodologies for constructing bioweapons or executing cyberattacks. Current safety measures often rely on static blocklists or overly restrictive content policies, which fail to balance safety with the need for legitimate scientific inquiry. For example, rigid keyword-based filters may incorrectly flag benign requests, while permissive approaches risk catastrophic misuse.  

Emerging works like *Safe RLHF* (Dai et al., 2023) and *RA-PbRL* (Zhao et al., 2024) highlight the potential of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align AI behavior with safety objectives. However, these methods primarily focus on post-hoc mitigation rather than proactive risk assessment during query processing. Additionally, challenges in transparency (as seen in systems like *DeepSeek*), adaptation to novel threats, and the integration of risk-aware decision-making remain unresolved.  

**Research Objectives**  
This project aims to develop a **Dynamic Risk-Adaptive Filter** (DRAF) that:  
1. Proactively intercepts dangerous-capability queries with a context-aware risk classifier.  
2. Dynamically enforces tailored safety policies (e.g., partial redaction, expert redirection) based on query risk levels.  
3. Continuously updates risk thresholds and response policies using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and adversarial training.  

**Significance**  
By addressing the gap between rigid and permissive safety strategies, DRAF seeks to minimize misuse while preserving access to beneficial knowledge. The framework’s adaptability to evolving threats and integration of human oversight will advance AI safety in high-stakes domains, contributing to regulatory standards and deployment best practices.

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### **2.1 Data Collection**  
- **Threat Taxonomy**: A dataset of dangerous-capability queries will be curated using a taxonomy of known risks (e.g., biosecurity, cybersecurity) and synthesized adversarial examples.  
- **User Simulation**: Generative models will simulate diverse query formulations (e.g., explicit vs. disguised requests) to train and stress-test the classifier.  
- **Human Feedback Dataset**: Annotators will label queries for risk severity (low/medium/high) and appropriateness of responses, forming a preference dataset for RLHF.  

#### **2.2 Stage 1: Risk Classification**  
A transformer-based classifier $C_\theta$ predicts a risk score $s \in [0, 1]$ for an input query $q$:  
$$ 
s = \sigma \left( W \cdot \text{Encoder}(q) + b \right), 
$$  
where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, and $\text{Encoder}(q)$ outputs the query’s contextual embedding. The model is trained on the threat taxonomy dataset using a focal loss to address class imbalance:  
$$ 
\mathcal{L}_{\text{focal}} = -\alpha_t (1 - p_t)^\gamma \log(p_t), 
$$  
where $p_t$ is the predicted probability for the true class, $\alpha_t$ balances class weights, and $\gamma$ focuses on hard examples.  

**Adversarial Training**: To improve robustness, queries are perturbed using synonym substitution and paraphrasing attacks.  

#### **2.3 Stage 2: Dynamic Policy Enforcement**  
The risk score $s$ triggers one of three policies:  
1. **Low Risk ($s < \tau_{\text{low}}$)**: The query proceeds unmodified.  
2. **Medium Risk ($\tau_{\text{low}} \leq s < \tau_{\text{high}}$)**: A safe-completion template replaces sensitive steps with high-level guidance. For example, for a query about synthesizing toxins:  
   - Original: "Explain the steps to synthesize ricin."  
   - Filtered: "Chemical synthesis of toxins requires specialized permits. Contact [Ethics Board] for regulated research guidelines."  
3. **High Risk ($s \geq \tau_{\text{high}}$)**: A refusal response is returned, optionally redirecting users to vetted resources (e.g., institutional review boards).  

**Threshold Adaptation**: Initial thresholds $\tau_{\text{low}}, \tau_{\text{high}}$ are set empirically and refined via RLHF.  

#### **2.4 Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback**  
A reward model $R_\phi$ is trained on human preferences to optimize a trade-off between safety and utility:  
$$ 
R_\phi(q, a) = \lambda \cdot R_{\text{safety}}(a) + (1 - \lambda) \cdot R_{\text{helpfulness}}(a), 
$$  
where $R_{\text{safety}}$ and $R_{\text{helpfulness}}$ are human-rated scores, and $\lambda$ controls the balance.  

The policy $\pi_\psi$ (i.e., threshold and response logic) is updated via proximal policy optimization (PPO) to maximize expected reward:  
$$ 
\mathbb{E}_{(q, a) \sim \pi_\psi} \left[ R_\phi(q, a) \right] - \beta \cdot \text{KL}(\pi_\psi || \pi_{\text{old}}), 
$$  
where $\beta$ penalizes drastic policy changes.  

#### **2.5 Experimental Design & Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against keyword blocking, static classifiers, and unregulated models.  
- **Evaluation Cohort**: 1,000 simulated and 200 real-world queries spanning low/medium/high-risk categories.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **False Negative Rate (FNR)**: Percentage of dangerous queries misclassified as safe.  
  - **User Satisfaction Score**: Assessed via Likert-scale surveys on response usefulness.  
  - **Policy Adaptation Speed**: Time to integrate new threat patterns into the classifier.  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Use paired t-tests and bootstrap confidence intervals to validate significance.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. A risk classifier achieving FNR < 5% on high-risk queries, outperforming static baselines by ≥20%.  
2. A dynamic policy framework that reduces over-blocking of benign queries by 30% compared to keyword filters.  
3. Human evaluators will rate DRAF responses as 25% more helpful than those from rigid safety systems.  

**Impact**  
- **Technical**: DRAF provides a blueprint for context-aware AI safety systems, advancing methods in adversarial robustness and RLHF.  
- **Policy**: The framework’s modular design can inform regulatory standards for AI deployment in sensitive domains.  
- **Societal**: By minimizing misuse risks without stifling innovation, DRAF promotes ethical AI development aligned with global safety initiatives like the EU AI Act.
