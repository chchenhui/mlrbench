# Dynamic Risk-Adaptive Filtering for Dangerous-Capability Queries

## Introduction

### Background
The advent of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in transformative capabilities, enabling rapid access to knowledge across domains. However, this progress also raises critical safety concerns, particularly regarding the potential misuse of AI systems to generate instructions for harmful applications (e.g., bioweapon design, cyberattacks). Current safety mechanisms, such as static keyword filters, often fail to balance utility and security: overly restrictive policies hinder legitimate research, while permissive approaches risk enabling malicious intent. As highlighted in the task description, this challenge is exacerbated by the evolving nature of threats, requiring adaptive defenses that dynamically assess and mitigate risks while preserving beneficial knowledge access.

### Research Objectives
This proposal aims to develop a **two-stage "Risk-Adaptive Filter"** that addresses three core requirements:
1. **Contextual Risk Sensitivity**: Replace static filters with a learned neural risk classifier capable of distinguishing edge-case queries from clear threats using a threat taxonomy enriched with adversarial examples.
2. **Dynamic Policy Enforcement**: Implement a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) framework that adjusts response strategies (safe completion templates, refusals) based on risk-score thresholds optimized via feedback.
3. **Proactive Threat Adaptation**: Establish a feedback pipeline to update policies against emerging threats without retraining the foundational model, leveraging risk measures like Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) for robustness.

### Significance
This work directly tackles the "dangerous capabilities" AI safety challenge outlined in the task brief. By combining advances in RLHF and risk-sensitive learning from the literature (e.g., Safe RLHF, RA-PbRL), the system will:
- Enable **differentiated responses**: safe completion of benign queries (e.g., "How do enzymes work in biodegradation?"), templated redirection of ambiguous cases (e.g., "What are the steps to engineer a virus?" → "I cannot assist with methods that could harm biosecurity, but I recommend consulting virology literature and biosafety protocols"), and refusal of high-risk queries.
- Reduce false negatives (dangerous queries erroneously passed) by 40%+ compared to existing filters while maintaining <5% false positives (safe queries incorrectly blocked).
- Set a precedent for **safe-by-design AI systems** in high-risk fields like AI-assisted biology and cybersecurity.

## Methodology

### Stage 1: Risk Classifier for Query Analysis

#### Threat Taxonomy Construction
We will curate a taxonomy of dangerous capabilities spanning eight domains (biotech, cybersecurity, chemical weapons, etc.) using:
- Existing datasets (MITRE BioSBAD, HarmBench)
- Manually annotated case studies from security whitepapers
- Third-party synthetic data generation via LLM-aided perturbation

#### Adversarial Dataset Augmentation
To improve robustness against evasion tactics, we will:
1. Generate paraphrased attacks using backtranslation (English→French→English)
2. Insert typos, code obfuscation patterns, and indirect phrasing (e.g., "oligos" → "genetic building blocks")
3. Balance the dataset with intermediately risky queries (e.g., "Explain CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing safety measures")

#### Neural Risk Classifier Architecture
A DeBERTa-v3-$\text{large}$ (1.5B parameters) model will be fine-tuned on 500K annotated queries labeled $y_i \in \{0,1\}$ (safe/dangerous). Binary cross-entropy loss with focal loss extension will address class imbalance:
$$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{clf}} = -\sum_{i=1}^N \left[ y_i (1-\gamma)\left(1-p_i\right)^\gamma \log p_i + (1-y_i)\gamma p_i^\gamma \log (1-p_i) \right] $$
where $p_i$ is predicted probability and $\gamma=2$ tunes robustness.

The model will output a continuous risk score $s \in [0,1]$ for input tokens $x_{1:T}$ via:
$$ s(x_{1:T}) = \sigma(W_h \cdot \text{CLS}_{\text{final}} + b_h) $$
where $\text{CLS}_{\text{final}} \in \mathbb{R}^{1,256}$ is the final-layer [CLS] token and $\sigma(\cdot)$ denotes logistic sigmoid.

### Stage 2: Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Response Policies

#### Reinforcement Learning Framework Design

| Component          | Specification                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **State Space $S$** | Risk score $s$, query token embedding $\in \mathbb{R}^{1,768}$, conversation history |
| **Action Space $A$** | {"approve", "template", "refuse + expert redirect"}                       |
| **Episode**          | Single user interaction. Max 3 turns per dialog.                            |

#### Reward Function Engineering
Feedback signals will come from expert annotations (n=100 experts across biosecurity, cybersecurity) and public policy guidelines. The reward $r$ for action $a$ in state $s$ combines three terms:
1. **Safety Reward** ($r_{\text{safe}}$): +1 if dangerous query blocked, -3 if dangerous query approved.
2. **Utility Reward** ($r_{\text{util}}$): Evaluated via semantic similarity (BERTScore) between model response and ideal safe response.
3. **Feedback Reward** ($r_{\text{human}}$): Crowdsourced binary approvals/disapprovals from 10K user trials.

$$ r(s,a) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if} \text{ } a=\text{"refuse"}, h(s) \geq \theta_{\text{high}} \\
\text{BERTScore}(y_{\text{pred}}, y_{\text{ref}}) & \text{if} \text{ } a=\text{"template"} \\
\delta \cdot \log (r_{\text{human}}+1) & \text{if} \text{ } a=\text{"approve"}
\end{cases} $$

#### Training Pipeline
1. **Pretraining**: Initialize policy $\pi_\theta$ with behavioral cloning from 200K human-crafted policy responses.
2. **PPO Optimization**: Use Proximal Policy Optimization (Clip $\epsilon=0.2$) with KL penalty coefficient updated dynamically based on entropy.
3. **Risk-Aware Updates**: Adapt thresholds $\theta_{\text{high}}, \theta_{\text{med}}$ using RA-PbRL's dynamic quantile approach:
   $$ \theta_t^* = \arg\min_{\theta} \left[ \mathbb{E}[r(s,a)] - \lambda \cdot \text{CVaR}_\alpha(r(s,a)) \right] $$
   where $\alpha=0.95$ ensures safety against worst-case 5% outcomes.

### Evaluation Design

#### Benchmark Datasets
1. **Synthetic DANGER-500K**: 500K queries across six domains generated via adversarial priming (30% unambiguous safe/dangerous, 40% ambiguous edge cases).
2. **Red-Team Dataset**: 30K real queries from DEF CON competitions and biosecurity risk assessments.
3. **Utility-100K**: 100K science/tech questions from MMLU and bioRxiv preprints.

#### Metrics
1. **Primary**:
   - $ \text{FNR} = \frac{\text{DangerouseAutoQueries}}{\text{AllDangerous}} $
   - $ \text{F1-Template} = \frac{2 \cdot \text{Recall} \cdot \text{Prec}}{\text{Recall}+\text{Prec}} $ for template accuracy
2. **Secondary**:
   - BERTScore for utility against MIT-licensed policy documents
   - Human evaluation: "do not block" rate on safe queries
   - Response latency (<300ms at 95th percentile)

#### Ablation Studies
1. Disabling adversarial training
2. Removing RLHF phase
3. Replacing PPO with Safe RLHF's cost-reward decomposition

#### Baselines
1. GPT-4 filter
2. Static regex/keyword filter
3. Iterated CVaR-RL without pretrained classifier

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Technical Advancements
1. **Risk Classifier**: Achieve 94% AUC-ROC on holdout test sets for dangerous vs. safe distinctions, outperforming regex-based systems by ≥30% F1-score.
2. **Adaptive Policy**: Reduce dangerous completions from current baselines (e.g., from 18%→4%) with ≤10% false positives on high-stakes queries.
3. **Benchmark Creation**: Release DANGER-500K and REDTEAM-30K datasets as new standards for safety research.

### Societal Impact
1. **Policy Enablement**: Support regulators (e.g., NIST, WHO) in establishing measurable safety thresholds for LLM deployments.
2. **Research Access**: Enable cautious exploration of safety-critical domains through high-level guidance (e.g., "I cannot describe malware code, but here are cybersecurity best practices").
3. **Equity Considerations**: Reduce overblocking of non-English/low-resource languages compared to keyword filters.

### Theoretical Contributions
1. **Risk-Aware RL Framework**: The threshold adaptation algorithm $\theta_t^*$ may generalize to other safety domains (e.g., robotics).
2. **Quantified Trade-offs**: Empirical investigation of safety/utility frontiers on a large-scale production-like system.

## Conclusion
This proposal presents a holistic risk management system for generative AI, bridging RLHF advancements with formal risk metrics. By unifying modular components (risk classifier, adaptive policy network) and rigorously validating them against Patent-like challenge sets, the research will establish a blueprint for responsible AI deployment in threat-suseptible application areas. The methodology specifically addresses the Project Descartes "Dangerous Capabilities" focus area, offering a replicable solution for mitigating AI enabling of harm while preserving societal benefits.
