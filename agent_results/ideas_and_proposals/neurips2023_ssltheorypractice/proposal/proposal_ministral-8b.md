### Research Proposal

#### Title
Sample Complexity Bounds for Contrastive vs. Non-Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning

#### Introduction

Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning by enabling models to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data. This has led to significant advancements in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech processing. However, despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of SSL remain largely unexplored. This research aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice by deriving sample complexity bounds for two dominant SSL paradigms: contrastive and non-contrastive methods.

Understanding the sample complexity of SSL methods is crucial for deploying them efficiently, especially in data-scarce domains. While SSL has shown promising results with abundant unlabeled data, theoretical guarantees on how much data is needed for specific tasks or modalities remain unclear. This lack of theoretical understanding leads to suboptimal model choices and inefficient resource allocation in practice.

The main idea of this research is to develop a theoretical framework to derive sample complexity bounds for contrastive and non-contrastive SSL methods. By leveraging tools from statistical learning theory, we will formalize how factors such as augmentation strength, network architecture, and latent space geometry affect the data requirements. The bounds will be validated through controlled experiments across vision, language, and time-series datasets, measuring convergence rates of learned representations against theoretical predictions. The outcomes will provide guidelines for selecting SSL methods based on data availability, modality, and task constraints, thereby bridging the theory-practice gap and informing practitioners on when to prefer contrastive or non-contrastive SSL.

#### Methodology

##### Research Design

The research will be conducted in three main phases: literature review, theoretical analysis, and empirical validation.

1. **Literature Review**: A comprehensive review of existing literature on SSL, focusing on contrastive and non-contrastive methods, will be conducted. This will include a detailed analysis of the key challenges and existing theoretical frameworks.

2. **Theoretical Analysis**: Using tools from statistical learning theory, we will derive sample complexity bounds for contrastive and non-contrastive SSL methods. The analysis will consider various factors such as augmentation strength, network architecture, and latent space geometry.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The theoretical bounds will be validated through controlled experiments across different datasets and modalities. The experiments will measure the convergence rates of learned representations and compare them against the theoretical predictions.

##### Data Collection

For empirical validation, we will use publicly available datasets in vision, language, and time-series domains. The datasets will include:

- **Vision**: ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.
- **Language**: GLUE benchmark, SQuAD, and MNLI.
- **Time-Series**: M4, M5, and M7 datasets.

##### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Data Augmentation**: Apply various data augmentation techniques to the input data to create unlabeled pairs for contrastive learning and similar data points for non-contrastive learning.

2. **Network Architecture**: Use different neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for vision tasks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for language tasks, and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for time-series tasks.

3. **Training Procedure**: Train the SSL models using the contrastive loss for contrastive methods and the non-contrastive loss for non-contrastive methods. The training procedure will include hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques to improve generalization.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate the performance of the SSL models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, measure the convergence rates of the learned representations against the theoretical predictions.

##### Mathematical Formulations

The sample complexity bounds for contrastive and non-contrastive SSL methods can be formulated as follows:

For contrastive SSL methods, the sample complexity bound can be derived using the Rademacher complexity and covering numbers. Let $N$ be the number of training examples, $d$ be the dimensionality of the feature space, and $L$ be the network depth. The sample complexity bound can be expressed as:

$$
N \geq \frac{\mathcal{R}_d \cdot \log(1 / \delta)}{\epsilon^2}
$$

where $\mathcal{R}_d$ is the Rademacher complexity, $\epsilon$ is the desired generalization error, and $\delta$ is the confidence level.

For non-contrastive SSL methods, the sample complexity bound can be derived using the norm-based bounds. Let $N$ be the number of training examples, $L$ be the network depth, and $W$ be the width of the network. The sample complexity bound can be expressed as:

$$
N \geq \frac{\|W\|_2^2 \cdot \log(1 / \delta)}{\epsilon^2}
$$

where $\|W\|_2$ is the norm of the network parameters, $\epsilon$ is the desired generalization error, and $\delta$ is the confidence level.
