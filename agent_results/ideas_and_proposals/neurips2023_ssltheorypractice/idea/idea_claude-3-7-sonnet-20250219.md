# Rethinking Auxiliary Task Design in Self-Supervised Learning: A Theoretical Framework

## Motivation
Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated remarkable empirical success across various domains, yet we lack a comprehensive theoretical understanding of why certain auxiliary tasks outperform others. This knowledge gap limits our ability to systematically design optimal SSL approaches for new domains and applications. Current auxiliary task design relies heavily on intuition and trial-and-error rather than principled guidelines. Developing a theoretical framework to analyze and compare auxiliary tasks would not only deepen our understanding of SSL but also enable more efficient and effective representation learning.

## Main Idea
This research proposes a theoretical framework to characterize auxiliary tasks in SSL based on their information-theoretic properties. We introduce the concept of "task alignment spectrum" that quantifies how auxiliary tasks relate to downstream tasks through mutual information metrics. Our framework models the relationship between task alignment, sample complexity, and representation quality, enabling predictive analysis of auxiliary task performance. We will derive theoretical bounds on representation learning efficiency for different classes of auxiliary tasks and validate these bounds empirically across vision, language, and graph domains. The framework will yield practical guidelines for designing optimal auxiliary tasks for specific applications, potentially reducing the computational resources needed for effective SSL. This work bridges the gap between theory and practice by providing actionable insights for practitioners while advancing the theoretical foundations of self-supervised learning.
