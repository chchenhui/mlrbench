**Title:** Sample Complexity Bounds for Contrastive vs. Non-Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning  

**Motivation:** Understanding the sample complexity of self-supervised learning (SSL) methods is critical for deploying them efficiently in data-scarce domains. While SSL excels with abundant unlabeled data, theoretical guarantees on how much data is needed for specific tasks or modalities remain unclear, leading to suboptimal model choices and resource allocation in practice.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a theoretical framework to derive sample complexity bounds for two dominant SSL paradigms: contrastive (e.g., SimCLR) and non-contrastive (e.g., DINO, BYOL) methods. Leveraging tools from statistical learning theory, we formalize how factors like augmentation strength, network architecture, and latent space geometry affect the data requirements. The bounds will be validated through controlled experiments across vision, language, and time-series datasets, measuring convergence rates of learned representations against theoretical predictions. Outcomes will yield guidelines for selecting SSL methods based on data availability, modality, and task constraints. This bridges the theory-practice gap by informing practitioners when to prefer contrastive or non-contrastive SSL, and by inspiring new algorithms that optimize sample efficiency.
