**Title:** Neural Field PDE Solvers: Adaptive Activation and Meta-Learning for Physics Simulation  
**Motivation:** Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is critical for physics and engineering, but traditional mesh-based methods are computationally expensive and struggle with high-dimensional or dynamic systems. Neural fields offer a mesh-free, continuous alternative but face challenges in efficiently capturing multi-scale phenomena and adapting to varying boundary conditions.  
**Main Idea:** We propose a neural field framework that combines spatially adaptive activation functions and meta-learning to solve PDEs. The model uses coordinate-based networks to map spatio-temporal coordinates to physical quantities (e.g., velocity, pressure) while enforcing PDE constraints via physics-informed losses. Adaptive activations, controlled by a learned attention mechanism, dynamically adjust based on input coordinates to resolve fine-scale features. Meta-learning optimizes initialization for rapid adaptation to unseen boundary/initial conditions, reducing per-scene optimization time. Experiments on fluid dynamics and wave propagation will benchmark accuracy and efficiency against FEM/baseline solvers. This approach aims to enable scalable, real-time simulations for complex systems, bridging gaps between neural fields and computational physics.
