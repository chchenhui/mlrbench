# Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural Networks for Robust Decision Making

## Motivation
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized learning on graph-structured data, but most implementations provide point estimates without quantifying prediction uncertainty. This limitation is critical in high-stakes applications like drug discovery, financial fraud detection, or infrastructure management, where decision makers need to understand confidence levels associated with model predictions. Current uncertainty quantification methods for GNNs often treat uncertainty as an afterthought rather than integrating it into the core model architecture, leading to unreliable confidence estimates on out-of-distribution data.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel Bayesian Graph Neural Network framework that incorporates uncertainty quantification directly into the message-passing architecture. Our approach introduces learnable uncertainty parameters at each layer of the GNN that propagate and transform alongside feature information. We implement this through a variational inference scheme where distributions over node and edge features are maintained throughout the computation graph, allowing for principled uncertainty propagation. The framework distinguishes between aleatoric uncertainty (data noise) and epistemic uncertainty (model knowledge gaps) through separate parameters, providing more interpretable uncertainty estimates. We also develop specialized attention mechanisms that weight neighbor contributions based on uncertainty levels, enabling the model to rely less on uncertain neighbors. Experiments on molecular property prediction, traffic forecasting, and social network analysis demonstrate that our method maintains high accuracy while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates that correlate with actual prediction errors.
