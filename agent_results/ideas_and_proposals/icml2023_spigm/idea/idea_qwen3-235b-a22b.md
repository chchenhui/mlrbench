**Title:** **Integrating Symbolic Domain Knowledge into Graph Neural Networks for Structured Generative Modeling**  

**Motivation:**  
Generative models for structured data (e.g., molecules, knowledge graphs) often fail to incorporate domain-specific constraints (e.g., chemical valency rules, physical laws), leading to invalid or unrealistic outputs. Existing methods struggle to balance flexibility with adherence to known principles, limiting their utility in critical applications like drug discovery or materials science. Encoding such knowledge explicitly could improve sample validity, reduce computational costs, and enhance trust in AI-generated outputs.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a hybrid framework that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) with symbolic reasoning to enforce domain constraints during generative modeling. First, domain knowledge (e.g., logical rules, equations) is encoded into a differentiable constraint layer using probabilistic soft logic or physics-informed neural networks. This layer is integrated into a GNN-based generative model (e.g., variational autoencoder or diffusion model) to shape the latent space and decoding process. During training, the model optimizes both data likelihood and constraint satisfaction via a weighted loss function. For example, in molecular generation, constraints could penalize valency violations or energetically unstable configurations. We evaluate the framework on tasks like generating valid molecules or simulating physical systems, measuring sample validity, diversity, and alignment with domain principles. Expected outcomes include a 20â€“30% increase in valid sample generation compared to baseline GNN models, with applications in accelerating scientific discovery and reducing experimental validation costs. This approach bridges the gap between data-driven learning and knowledge-driven reasoning for structured data.
