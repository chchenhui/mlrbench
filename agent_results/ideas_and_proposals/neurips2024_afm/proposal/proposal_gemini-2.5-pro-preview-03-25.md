## 1. Title: Dynamic Sparse Adapters for Scalable and Efficient Personalized Foundation Models

## 2. Introduction

**2.1 Background**
Foundation Models (FMs), such as Large Language Models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020) and large-scale vision models (Radford et al., 2021; Rombach et al., 2022), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their monolithic, pre-trained nature often falls short in scenarios demanding user-specific nuances, preferences, or knowledge. Personalization, the process of tailoring FM behavior to individual users, is becoming increasingly crucial for applications like personalized chatbots, recommendation systems, content generation tools, and user-centric AI assistants (Li et al., 2023).

Adapting FMs for personalization typically involves fine-tuning strategies. Full fine-tuning, while effective, requires creating and storing a complete copy of the model parameters for each user, leading to prohibitive computational and storage costs, especially when scaling to millions of users. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a promising alternative, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Techniques like Adapter modules (Houlsby et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2020), LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) (Hu et al., 2021), prompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021), and prefix tuning (Li & Liang, 2021) involve training only a small set of auxiliary parameters while keeping the bulk of the FM frozen. Recent advancements focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness PEFT, including adaptive budget allocation (Zhang et al., 2023 - AdaLoRA), integrating quantization (Kim et al., 2023 - PEQA; Lee et al., 2024 - QEFT; Zhou et al., 2025 - QuZO), early pruning (Gu et al., 2024 - Light-PEFT), and exploring novel parameterization schemes (Zhang et al., 2025 - Deconvolution in Subspace). Comprehensive reviews and empirical analyses highlight the trade-offs involved (Xu et al., 2023; Doering et al., 2024; Oliver & Wang, 2024).

Despite these advances, scaling personalization via PEFT methods still faces challenges. Storing even lightweight dense adapters (e.g., LoRA matrices) for millions of users can consume substantial memory. Furthermore, existing PEFT methods often employ a *static* parameter allocation strategyâ€”the same subset or type of parameters is tuned for all tasks or users. This might be suboptimal, as different users may require adaptations in different parts of the model, and the optimal adaptation strategy might depend on the specific input or context. There is a need for a more dynamic, resource-aware, and scalable approach to personalization that can allocate adaptation capacity precisely where needed for each user, minimizing redundancy and maximizing efficiency.

This research proposal introduces **Dynamic Sparse Adapters (DSAs)**, a novel framework for highly scalable and efficient personalization of foundation models. The core idea is to utilize lightweight, user-specific adapter modules that are dynamically sparsified based on user context. Instead of training dense adapter parameters for each user, DSAs learn to activate only a small, relevant subset of adapter parameters, guided by a gating mechanism optimized via reinforcement learning. This approach allows substantial parameter sharing across users while enabling fine-grained, personalized adaptations, drastically reducing per-user memory overhead and computational cost during inference.

**2.2 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop the Dynamic Sparse Adapter (DSA) Framework:** Design and implement a novel adapter architecture where user-specific adaptations are represented by sparse parameter subsets within a larger, potentially shared, adapter module space.
2.  **Design a Dynamic Gating Mechanism:** Develop a context-aware gating network, potentially conditioned on user embeddings and input features, that dynamically selects the active sparse pathways within the adapter for a given user and inference step.
3.  **Integrate Reinforcement Learning for Gating Optimization:** Formulate the dynamic sparsity selection process as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, where the gating network acts as a policy network trained to optimize a trade-off between personalization performance and parameter sparsity (efficiency).
4.  **Incorporate Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation:** Explore the use of meta-learning techniques to find optimal initializations for the adapter parameters and/or the gating network, enabling rapid and effective personalization for new users with minimal data.
5.  **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Empirically evaluate the DSA framework on diverse personalization tasks across different modalities (e.g., personalized text generation, personalized text-to-image generation) and foundation model architectures. Assess performance in terms of personalization accuracy, per-user memory footprint, inference latency, and training efficiency.
6.  **Comparative Analysis:** Benchmark DSAs against state-of-the-art personalization techniques, including full fine-tuning, dense PEFT methods (e.g., LoRA, Adapters), and static sparse adaptation methods.

**2.3 Significance**
This research holds significant potential for advancing the field of adaptive and personalized AI:

1.  **Scalability:** By drastically reducing the per-user parameter overhead (potentially 5-10x compared to dense adapters), DSAs can enable the deployment of personalized foundation models at an unprecedented scale, serving millions or even billions of users efficiently.
2.  **Efficiency:** Dynamic sparsity reduces the computational cost during inference, as only the activated adapter parameters need to be processed. This is crucial for deploying personalized models on resource-constrained devices (e.g., mobile phones, edge devices).
3.  **Performance:** By dynamically selecting relevant adaptation pathways, DSAs may achieve better personalization quality compared to static PEFT methods, especially under tight parameter budgets, allocating resources adaptively based on user needs.
4.  **Democratization:** Making personalized AI more resource-efficient lowers the barrier for researchers and practitioners to develop and deploy user-centric applications, fostering innovation.
5.  **Privacy Considerations:** While not the primary focus, concentrating user-specific information into small, sparse updates might offer avenues for enhanced privacy-preserving techniques compared to methods requiring broader model modifications. User data influences only a small, dynamically chosen subset of parameters, potentially limiting information leakage.
6.  **Advancing PEFT Methodology:** This work contributes a novel dynamic and sparse approach to the PEFT landscape, complementing existing techniques like quantization and low-rank factorization, and addressing the specific challenges of large-scale personalization identified in recent surveys and empirical studies (Xu et al., 2023; Doering et al., 2024).

Success in this research would represent a significant step towards adaptable, efficient, and truly personalized foundation models, aligning directly with the core themes of the Adaptive Foundation Models workshop.

## 3. Methodology

**3.1 Overall Framework**
Let $F(\cdot; \theta_{base})$ denote a pre-trained foundation model with parameters $\theta_{base}$. Our goal is to adapt $F$ for a large set of users $\{U_1, U_2, ..., U_N\}$ using minimal additional parameters per user. The core idea of DSA is to introduce adapter layers at specific locations within the FM (e.g., within each Transformer block). Unlike standard adapters, each DSA layer contains a set of potential parameters, and for a specific user $U_i$ and input $x$, only a sparse subset of these parameters is activated.

The modified forward pass through an adapted layer $l$ can be represented as:
$$h_{l+1} = F_l(h_l; \theta_{base}^{(l)}) + \Delta F_l(h_l; \theta_{adapter}^{(l)}, m_i^{(l)})$$
where $h_l$ is the hidden state input to layer $l$, $F_l$ is the original transformation of the base model at layer $l$, $\theta_{base}^{(l)}$ are the frozen base parameters, $\Delta F_l$ is the transformation performed by the user-specific adapter, $\theta_{adapter}^{(l)}$ represents the parameters of the adapter module at layer $l$, and $m_i^{(l)}$ is a user-specific binary mask that determines the sparse subset of $\theta_{adapter}^{(l)}$ to be used for user $U_i$. The key innovation lies in how $m_i^{(l)}$ is dynamically generated and how $\theta_{adapter}^{(l)}$ is structured and trained.

**3.2 Dynamic Sparse Adapter (DSA) Module Design**
Each adapter module $\Delta F_l$ will consist of parameters $\theta_{adapter}^{(l)}$. We can draw inspiration from efficient structures like LoRA, where the adapter projects the hidden state down to a lower dimension $r$ and then back up. Let $\theta_{adapter}^{(l)} = \{ W_{down}^{(l)}, W_{up}^{(l)} \}$, where $W_{down}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ and $W_{up}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d}$, with $d$ being the hidden dimension. The adapter transformation is $\Delta F_l(h_l) = h_l W_{down}^{(l)} W_{up}^{(l)}$.

In the DSA framework, we introduce sparsity. The mask $m_i^{(l)}$ controls which elements or structures within $W_{down}^{(l)}$ and $W_{up}^{(l)}$ are active for user $U_i$. For instance, $m_i^{(l)}$ could be a binary mask applied element-wise or structured to activate/deactivate entire rows/columns or low-rank components. The effective adapter parameters for user $U_i$ become $\theta_{adapter, i}^{(l)} = \theta_{adapter}^{(l)} \odot m_i^{(l)}$, where $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication or a structured masking operation. The sparsity level $s = ||m_i^{(l)}||_0 / |\theta_{adapter}^{(l)}|$ is a critical hyperparameter, controlled dynamically.

**3.3 Gating Network for Dynamic Sparsity**
A gating network $G(\cdot; \phi)$ determines the mask $m_i^{(l)}$ for each user $U_i$ and potentially each input $x$. The gating network takes user-specific information and context as input and outputs the sparsity mask.

*   **Input:** The input to the gating network can include a user embedding $u_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_u}$ (pre-trained or learned jointly) and potentially context features $c_x$ derived from the input $x$ (e.g., topic embedding, task type).
*   **Output:** The gating network outputs parameters that define the mask $m_i^{(l)}$ for each adapted layer $l$. This could be probabilities for Bernoulli sampling for each parameter/structure in $\theta_{adapter}^{(l)}$, followed by sampling or thresholding to obtain the binary mask $m_i^{(l)}$.
*   **Architecture:** The gating network $G$ can be a small neural network (e.g., MLP).

**3.4 Reinforcement Learning for Gating Policy Optimization**
We formulate the selection of the mask $m_i^{(l)}$ as a sequential decision process optimized via RL. The gating network $G$ acts as the policy network $\pi(m_i | s_i)$, where $s_i$ represents the state.

*   **State ($s_i$):** Can include the user embedding $u_i$, potentially the input context $c_x$, and possibly information about the current computational budget or desired sparsity level.
*   **Action ($a_i$):** The action is the generation of the sparsity masks $\{m_i^{(l)}\}_{l=1}^L$ for all adapted layers $L$.
*   **Policy ($\pi(a_i | s_i; \phi)$):** Parameterized by the gating network $G(\cdot; \phi)$.
*   **Reward ($R_i$):** The reward function needs to balance personalization performance and sparsity. A possible formulation is:
    $$R_i = \text{Performance}(F(x; \theta_{base}, \{\theta_{adapter}^{(l)} \odot m_i^{(l)}\}_l), y_i) - \lambda \sum_{l=1}^L ||m_i^{(l)}||_0$$
    where $\text{Performance}(\cdot)$ measures how well the adapted model performs on user $U_i$'s specific data $(x, y_i)$ (e.g., negative log-likelihood for generation, accuracy for classification), $||m_i^{(l)}||_0$ is the $L_0$ norm (count of non-zero elements) representing the number of active parameters in the adapter at layer $l$, and $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter controlling the trade-off between performance and sparsity/efficiency.
*   **Optimization:** We can use policy gradient methods like REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) to update the gating network parameters $\phi$ by maximizing the expected cumulative reward:
    $$J(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{s_i \sim \rho, a_i \sim \pi(\cdot|s_i; \phi)}[R_i]$$
    $$\nabla_{\phi} J(\phi) = \mathbb{E}[\nabla_{\phi} \log \pi(a_i | s_i; \phi) R_i]$$ (for REINFORCE)

**3.5 Sparsity-Constrained Adapter Parameter Training**
Given the masks $m_i = \{m_i^{(l)}\}_l$ generated by the gating network (or fixed during alternating optimization), the adapter parameters $\theta_{adapter} = \{\theta_{adapter}^{(l)}\}_l$ are trained using standard supervised learning objectives on the user-specific data. Crucially, gradients are only computed and applied to the active parameters indicated by the masks.
Let $\mathcal{L}(F(x; \theta_{base}, \theta_{adapter} \odot m_i), y_i)$ be the task-specific loss for user $U_i$. The adapter parameters are updated via gradient descent:
$$\theta_{adapter} \leftarrow \theta_{adapter} - \eta \nabla_{\theta_{adapter}} \mathcal{L}(F(x; \theta_{base}, \theta_{adapter} \odot m_i), y_i) \odot m_i$$
This ensures only the active parameters selected by the gating network for that user are updated. Training can involve iterating between updating the gating network policy $\phi$ (RL step) and updating the adapter parameters $\theta_{adapter}$ (supervised learning step).

**3.6 Meta-Learning for Initialization (Optional but Recommended)**
To enable fast adaptation for new users, we can employ meta-learning. The goal is to learn an initialization $\theta_{adapter}^{(0)}$ for the adapter parameters (and potentially $\phi^{(0)}$ for the gating network) such that they can be quickly specialized to any new user $U_{new}$ with a small amount of data. We can use algorithms like Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) (Finn et al., 2017). During meta-training, we sample batches of tasks (users), perform inner-loop updates (RL for gating, supervised for adapters) on the user's support set, and update the meta-parameters ($\theta_{adapter}^{(0)}$, $\phi^{(0)}$) based on performance on the user's query set.

**3.7 Data Collection and Datasets**
We will use publicly available datasets suitable for personalization across modalities:

*   **Text Personalization:**
    *   **PersonaChat (Zhang et al., 2018):** A dialogue dataset where models must converse based on a given persona. We can treat each persona as a "user" requiring personalized conversational style.
    *   **Amazon Product Reviews (McAuley et al., 2015):** Can be adapted for personalized review generation or recommendation description generation, using user IDs to define personalization targets. User writing style or item preferences define personalization.
    *   **Synthetic Data:** We may generate synthetic user profiles and interaction histories to simulate diverse personalization needs at scale.
*   **Image Personalization:**
    *   **DreamBooth / Custom Diffusion Datasets:** Use existing datasets or protocols where models need to inject user-specific subjects or styles into images (e.g., based on 3-5 user-provided images). Each subject/style constitutes a user.
    *   **CelebA-HQ (Karras et al., 2018):** Can be used for personalized face editing or attribute manipulation, partitioning identities as users.
    *   **LAION-Aesthetics (Schuhmann et al., 2022):** User preferences for aesthetic styles can be simulated or collected, training models to generate images matching user style profiles.

For each dataset, we will create splits for meta-training (if used), training the DSA system (adapters + gating), validation (hyperparameter tuning, e.g., $\lambda$, learning rates, architecture choices), and testing (evaluating on unseen users/personas/styles).

**3.8 Experimental Design**
*   **Foundation Models:** Experiments will be conducted on standard FMs like Llama-2/3 (Touvron et al., 2023) or Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023) for text, and Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) or similar models for image generation.
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **Zero-Shot FM:** Base FM performance without any fine-tuning.
    2.  **Full Fine-Tuning (per user):** An upper bound on performance (impractical for storage).
    3.  **Dense Adapters:** Standard Adapter modules (Houlsby et al., 2019).
    4.  **LoRA:** Low-Rank Adaptation (Hu et al., 2021). Use comparable parameter counts to DSAs for fair comparison.
    5.  **Static Sparse Adapters:** Adapters with a fixed, pre-defined sparsity pattern (e.g., randomly chosen or based on magnitude pruning after dense training), with the same sparsity level as achieved by DSA. This isolates the benefit of *dynamic* sparsity.
    6.  **AdaLoRA (Zhang et al., 2023):** Represents adaptive budget allocation for PEFT, though not dynamically sparse per-user in the same way.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Personalization Quality:**
        *   *Text:* Perplexity (PPL), BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR scores against reference texts. Human evaluation for coherence, style consistency, and relevance to persona/user profile. BERTScore or similar semantic similarity measures.
        *   *Image:* Frechet Inception Distance (FID), CLIP Score (similarity between generated image and text prompt/style description), Subject Fidelity (e.g., DINO similarity for DreamBooth), Aesthetic Score (if applicable). Human evaluation for subject/style adherence and image quality.
    *   **Efficiency:**
        *   *Memory:* Number of trainable parameters per user (adapter + gating state if applicable), total model size increase for N users.
        *   *Inference Speed:* Latency per token/image generated (ms). Throughput (tokens/sec or images/sec).
        *   *Training Cost:* FLOPs required for personalization per user, total training time.
    *   **Sparsity:** Achieved average sparsity level $s$ in the adapters across users. Distribution of sparsity levels.
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    1.  **DSA vs. Dense:** Compare DSA directly with dense adapters (LoRA/Adapters) using the same total parameter budget per user (DSA will use fewer active parameters but potentially a larger pool).
    2.  **Dynamic vs. Static Sparsity:** Compare DSA against Static Sparse Adapters with matched sparsity levels.
    3.  **Impact of RL Gating:** Evaluate the performance difference when using the RL-optimized gating vs. random gating or a simpler heuristic.
    4.  **Impact of Meta-Learning:** Compare performance with and without meta-initialized parameters, especially for few-shot personalization scenarios.
    5.  **Sparsity-Performance Trade-off:** Analyze the relationship between the sparsity control parameter $\lambda$ and the resulting personalization quality and efficiency metrics.
