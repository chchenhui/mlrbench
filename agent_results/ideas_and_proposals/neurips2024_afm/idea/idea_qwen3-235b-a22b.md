1. **Title**: Modular Continual Learning with Dynamic Parameter Routing for Adaptive Foundation Models  

2. **Motivation**: Continual weight updates in foundation models face catastrophic forgetting and high computational costs when adapting to new data. Existing methods struggle to balance retention of past knowledge with efficient, real-time updates. This limits applications in dynamic environments like news analysis or personalized systems, where models must evolve without retraining from scratch.  

3. **Main Idea**: Propose a modular architecture where each continual update introduces lightweight, task-specific subnetworks (modules) that dynamically route inputs through a combination of old and new parameters. A trainable router learns to activate relevant modules based on input context, preserving core knowledge while enabling targeted adaptation. Modules are sparsely updated using meta-learning to minimize interference, and outdated modules are pruned via a forgetting metric. Methodology includes: (1) a routing network trained on temporal context, (2) sparse parameter updates guided by importance scores, and (3) meta-learning to ensure module compatibility. Expected outcomes: reduced forgetting (via module isolation), 50%+ lower compute for updates, and improved adaptation to sequential tasks. Impact: enables efficient, lifelong learning for real-world systems requiring real-time personalization and knowledge evolution without full retraining.
