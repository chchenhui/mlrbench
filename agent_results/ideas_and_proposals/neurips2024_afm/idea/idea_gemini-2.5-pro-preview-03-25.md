**Title:** Hierarchical Personalized Adaptation via Adaptive Parameter Allocation

**Motivation:** Personalizing large foundation models for individual users often requires significant computational resources or compromises adaptability by only tuning limited parameters (e.g., prompts). There's a need for methods that efficiently capture diverse user preferences across different granularities (e.g., writing style, domain knowledge) without retraining the entire model or storing numerous personalized copies.

**Main Idea:** We propose a hierarchical adaptation framework where user-specific parameters are dynamically allocated and trained based on interaction data. The core idea involves using meta-learning to train a hypernetwork that generates low-rank updates (similar to LoRA) for different model layers or components. Crucially, the hypernetwork learns to allocate *more parameter budget* (higher rank or more adapted layers) to parts of the model most relevant to a user's specific deviation from the base model, inferred from their interaction history. This allows fine-grained personalization where needed (e.g., specific domain knowledge) while minimally perturbing general capabilities, resulting in a highly parameter-efficient, yet deeply personalized model for each user. Expected outcomes include superior personalization with fewer parameters compared to uniform low-rank adaptation, enabling scalable deployment.
