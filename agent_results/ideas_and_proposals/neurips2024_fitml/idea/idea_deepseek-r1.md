**Title:** Sparse-LowRank Hybrid Adaptation: Efficient and Scalable Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models  

**Motivation:** Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices remains a critical challenge. Current low-rank adaptation (LoRA) methods reduce trainable parameters but fix the sparse, task-critical weight shifts, potentially limiting adaptability. A hybrid approach integrating sparsity and low-rank structures could enhance parameter efficiency while preserving expressivity, addressing the gap between theoretical optimization principles and practical deployment needs.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes Sparse-LowRank Hybrid Adaptation (SLA), which synergizes structured sparsity masks with low-rank matrix decompositions for fine-tuning LLMs. SLA employs a dynamic gating mechanism to sparsely activate subsets of low-rank adapters, enabling adaptive parameter allocation based on task-specific signals. Theoretically, we analyze the approximation bounds of hybrid sparse-low-rank parameterizations, linking sparsity patterns to gradient dynamics and generalization. Optimization will integrate proximal methods for sparse updates with Riemannian techniques for low-rank manifold constraints. Experiments on benchmark NLP tasks will measure compute/memory efficiency and accuracy against LoRA and pure sparse fine-tuning. Expected outcomes include a 30-50% reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA, with comparable or improved task performance, and theoretical guarantees on convergence. If successful, SLA could democratize LLM fine-tuning for edge devices while advancing foundational insights into structured parameter-efficient adaptations.
