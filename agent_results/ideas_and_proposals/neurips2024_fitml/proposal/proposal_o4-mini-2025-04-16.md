1. Title  
Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning: Adaptive Error-Map Driven Parameter‐Efficient Adaptation for Large Models  

2. Introduction  
Background. Pre‐trained large models (e.g., BERT, GPT, LLaMA) have revolutionized NLP, vision, and code generation by providing rich representations that can be specialized via fine‐tuning. Traditional fine‐tuning updates all model parameters uniformly, yet empirical and theoretical studies (e.g., “A Stability Analysis of Fine‐Tuning a Pre‐Trained Model,” Fu et al., 2023; FAIT, Fan et al., 2025) show that not all parameters contribute equally to downstream errors. Uniform updates waste compute on well‐behaved components while under‐optimizing error‐prone ones. As models scale to billions of parameters and edge deployments become critical, resource‐efficient fine‐tuning under constrained budgets is essential.  

Research Objectives. We propose Residual‐Guided Fine‐Tuning (RGFT), a framework that continuously tracks per‐component residuals to (1) identify error‐prone model regions, (2) adaptively allocate learning rates and sparsify updates, and (3) provide convergence guarantees. Specifically, RGFT aims to (a) reduce FLOPs and training time by at least 50–70% relative to full fine‐tuning, (b) match or exceed baseline performance on NLP, vision, and code tasks, and (c) maintain theoretical convergence and generalization properties.  

Significance. RGFT addresses key challenges in modern fine‐tuning: pinpointing error‐prone components, dynamic resource allocation, and stability under adaptive updates. By integrating residual analysis, dynamic sparsification, and rigorous theory, RGFT will enable deployment of large models on resource‐limited devices (e.g., mobile phones, IoT) and shed light on fine‐tuning dynamics, guiding future parameter‐efficient methods.  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Overview  
RGFT consists of three core modules:  
1. Residual Tracking: compute and aggregate per‐component error contributions.  
2. Adaptive Update Scheduling: adjust learning rates and mask parameters based on error maps.  
3. Theoretical Framework: establish convergence and transfer learning guarantees under adaptive schedules.  

A high‐level pseudocode is shown below:  
```
Initialize pre‐trained model parameters Θ(0)
Set smoothing factor α, base LR η0, sparsity threshold τ, mask update rate γ
For t = 1 … T:
  1. Compute batch loss Lt(Θ(t−1))
  2. For each component i (layer, head, neuron group):
       r_i(t) ← α·r_i(t−1) + (1−α)·ErrorContribution(i, Lt)
  3. Determine mask M_i(t):
       M_i(t) = 1 if r_i(t) > τ, else γ
  4. Set component‐wise LR:
       η_i(t) = η0 · (1 + β · normalize(r_i(t)))
  5. Update:
       Θ_i(t) = Θ_i(t−1) − η_i(t) · M_i(t) · ∇_{Θ_i} Lt
End For
```

3.2 Residual Tracking Mechanism  
We define model components at a granularity of layer × attention‐head or neuron group. Let $C$ be the total number of such components, indexed by $i=1,\dots,C$. For a mini‐batch at iteration $t$, with loss $L^{(t)}$, we measure the contribution of component $i$ via the normed gradient:  
$$g_i^{(t)} = \|\nabla_{\Theta_i} L^{(t)}\|_2\,. $$  
We maintain an exponential moving average of residuals:  
$$r_i^{(t)} = \alpha\,r_i^{(t-1)} + (1-\alpha)\,\frac{g_i^{(t)}}{\sum_{j=1}^C g_j^{(t)}},\quad r_i^{(0)} = \frac1C.$$  
Here $\alpha\in[0,1)$ controls smoothing. The normalized residual $r_i^{(t)}$ approximates cumulative error contribution, forming an “error map” over components.  

3.3 Adaptive Sparsification & Learning‐Rate Scheduling  
Given residuals $\{r_i^{(t)}\}$, RGFT applies:  
1. **Masking.** Let $\tau^{(t)}$ be a dynamic threshold (e.g., median of $\{r_i^{(t)}\}$ or a percentile). We define a binary (or soft) mask  
$$M_i^{(t)} = \begin{cases}
1, & r_i^{(t)} \ge \tau^{(t)},\\
\gamma, & r_i^{(t)} < \tau^{(t)},
\end{cases}\quad \gamma\in[0,1)\,. $$  
This prunes low‐error components ($\gamma=0$ yields hard sparsity). Periodically we reset or adjust $\tau^{(t)}$ to adapt to evolving error distributions.  

2. **Adaptive Learning Rates.** We set per‐component learning rates as  
$$\eta_i^{(t)} = \eta_0 \left[1 + \beta\left(\frac{r_i^{(t)} - \bar r^{(t)}}{\sigma_r^{(t)}}\right)\right],$$  
where $\bar r^{(t)}$ and $\sigma_r^{(t)}$ are the mean and standard deviation of $\{r_i^{(t)}\}$, and $\beta>0$ controls sensitivity. This allocates higher $\eta_i$ to high‐error components, accelerating their correction.  

3.4 Theoretical Framework and Convergence Guarantees  
We model RGFT as a form of component‐wise adaptive SGD with masking. Under the following standard assumptions:  
(A1) $L(Θ)$ is $L$‐smooth for each component group,  
(A2) stochastic gradients have bounded variance,  
(A3) learning rates satisfy $\sum_t \eta_i^{(t)} = \infty$, $\sum_t (\eta_i^{(t)})^2 < \infty$,  
we can prove a convergence result adapted from Grey et al. (2023):  

Theorem 1 (Convergence of RGFT). Under (A1)–(A3) and with masks $M_i^{(t)}\ge m_{\min}>0$, the expected gradient norm vanishes:  
$$\lim_{T\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \mathbb{E}\Big[\|\nabla L(\Theta^{(t)})\|^2\Big] = 0\,. $$  

Proof Sketch. The proof follows the standard analysis of adaptive SGD with per‐coordinate step sizes and bounded mask factors. Masking factors lower‐bound ensures sufficient exploration. Learning‐rate conditions guarantee diminishing but infinite exploration.  

Moreover, we derive a transfer learning bound: fine‐tuning error scales with the residual‐weighted parameter update norm, ensuring that well‐generalized pre‐trained components are not over‐modified.
