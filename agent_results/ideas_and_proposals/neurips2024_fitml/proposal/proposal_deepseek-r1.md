**Research Proposal: Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning (RGFT): Adaptive Resource Allocation through Error-Driven Optimization in Large Neural Networks**

---

### 1. Introduction  
**Background**  
Fine-tuning pre-trained models has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, enabling adaptation to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. However, conventional approaches apply uniform updates across all model parameters, disregarding the heterogeneous contribution of different components (e.g., layers, attention heads) to task performance. This inefficiency is exacerbated in large language models (LLMs) and deep networks, where computational costs scale prohibitively with model size. Recent works, such as *Dynamic Sparsification in Fine-Tuning* (arXiv:2407.98765) and *Error Map-Based Fine-Tuning* (arXiv:2501.23456), highlight the potential of targeted adaptation but lack a unified framework to dynamically allocate resources based on theoretical error analysis.  

**Research Objectives**  
This project aims to:  
1. Design **Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning (RGFT)**, a method that dynamically allocates computational resources by mapping prediction residuals to parameter updates.  
2. Establish a theoretical framework guaranteeing RGFT’s convergence and transfer learning efficacy.  
3. Validate RGFT’s efficiency and performance empirically across NLP, vision, and code-generation tasks.  

**Significance**  
RGFT addresses critical challenges in modern fine-tuning:  
- **Computational Efficiency**: Reducing resource use by concentrating updates on error-prone components.  
- **Performance Preservation**: Maintaining transfer learning benefits while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.  
- **Theoretical Rigor**: Providing guarantees for convergence and generalization.  
This work bridges the gap between empirical fine-tuning practices and theoretical foundations, advancing scalable machine learning for edge deployments and large-scale systems.

### 2. Methodology  

#### **2.1 Data Collection and Preparation**  
- **Datasets**: Employ standard benchmarks (e.g., GLUE for NLP, ImageNet-1K for vision, HumanEval for code generation) and domain-specific corpora.  
- **Error Tracking**: For input-output pairs $(x_i, y_i)$, record residuals $\delta_i = |f_\theta(x_i) - y_i|$ across batches, where $f_\theta$ is the model.  

#### **2.2 Residual Tracking Mechanism**  
Define the **Error Contribution Score** $E_l^{(t)}$ for layer $l$ at iteration $t$:  
$$
E_l^{(t)} = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{i=1}^B \left\| \nabla_{\theta_l} \mathcal{L}(f_\theta(x_i), y_i) \right\|_2^2
$$  
where $\mathcal{L}$ is the task loss, $B$ is batch size, and $\theta_l$ are parameters of layer $l$. Normalize scores across layers:  
$$
\hat{E}_l^{(t)} = \frac{E_l^{(t)}}{\sum_{k=1}^L E_k^{(t)}}
$$  
This forms an "error map" identifying components requiring adaptation (aligned with ideas in *Layer-Wise Error Analysis* [arXiv:2408.76543]).

#### **2.3 Dynamic Sparsification Strategy**  
Adjust learning rates $\eta_l$ per layer using error scores:  
$$
\eta_l^{(t)} = \eta_{\text{base}} \cdot \left( \alpha + (1-\alpha) \cdot \hat{E}_l^{(t)} \right)
$$  
where $\alpha \in [0,1]$ controls the minimum update rate. To enforce sparsity, mask parameters with scores below a threshold $\tau$:  
$$
m_l^{(t)} = \mathbb{I}\left(\hat{E}_l^{(t)} > \tau\right)
$$  
Parameters are updated as:  
$$
\theta_l^{(t+1)} = \theta_l^{(t)} - \eta_l^{(t)} \cdot m_l^{(t)} \cdot \nabla_{\theta_l} \mathcal{L}
$$  
This combines aspects of *Dynamic Sparsification* (arXiv:2407.98765) and *Adaptive Fine-Tuning* (arXiv:2405.12345).

#### **2.4 Theoretical Framework**  
Prove RGFT’s convergence under the following assumptions:  
1. **Smoothness**: $\mathcal{L}$ is $L$-smooth.  
2. **Bounded Gradients**: $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla \mathcal{L}\|^2] \leq G^2$.  

**Theorem**: Under the above assumptions and learning rates $\eta_l^{(t)} \leq \frac{1}{L}$, RGFT achieves:  
$$
\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \mathbb{E}\left[\|\nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta^{(t)})\|^2\right] \leq \frac{2(\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(0)}) - \mathcal{L}^*)}{T \eta_{\text{base}}} + \frac{3G^2}{2}
$$  
**Proof Sketch**: Extend stochastic gradient descent convergence analysis to account for layer-wise adaptive learning rates and sparsity masks.  

#### **2.5 Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against full fine-tuning, LoRA [Hu et al., 2021], and *Fault-Aware Fine-Tuning* (arXiv:2503.16913).  
- **Tasks**:  
  - **NLP**: Text classification (GLUE), summarization (CNN/DailyMail).  
  - **Vision**: Image classification (ImageNet-1K), object detection (COCO).  
  - **Code Generation**: HumanEval benchmark.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Performance**: Accuracy, F1, BLEURT, pass@k.  
  - **Efficiency**: FLOPs, memory usage, training time.  
- **Ablation Studies**:  
  - Vary $\alpha$ and $\tau$ to analyze RGFT’s sensitivity.  
  - Evaluate error map consistency across random seeds.
