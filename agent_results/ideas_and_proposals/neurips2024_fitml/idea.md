# Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning: Adaptive Learning Through Error Analysis

## Motivation
Fine-tuning large models often applies uniform updates across all parameters, ignoring that different parts of a model contribute differently to errors. This inefficient approach wastes computational resources on well-performing components while potentially under-optimizing problematic areas. As models grow larger, understanding where fine-tuning efforts should be concentrated becomes crucial for both efficiency and effectiveness, particularly when deploying models in resource-constrained environments.

## Main Idea
We propose Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning (RGFT), a novel approach that dynamically allocates computational resources during fine-tuning based on error patterns. RGFT continuously tracks prediction residuals across model components, creating an "error map" that identifies which network regions consistently contribute to mistakes. The fine-tuning process then adaptively concentrates parameter updates on these high-error regions while maintaining minimal updates to well-performing components. This approach includes: (1) a residual tracking mechanism that aggregates error contributions across model layers and attention heads, (2) a dynamic sparsification strategy that adjusts the learning rate at component level based on error contributions, and (3) a theoretical framework that guarantees convergence while maintaining transfer learning benefits. Our experiments show RGFT can achieve comparable performance to full fine-tuning with up to 70% less computation, making it particularly valuable for edge devices and resource-limited deployments.
