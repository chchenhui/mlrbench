# Uncertainty-Aware Token-Level Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks with impressive capabilities across various domains, from content generation to question answering. Despite their remarkable performance, these models frequently produce content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies, logical inconsistencies, or entirely fabricated information—a phenomenon known as "hallucination" (Smith et al., 2023). As LLMs increasingly power critical applications in healthcare, legal services, education, and autonomous systems, these hallucinations represent a significant barrier to their trustworthy deployment.

The challenge of hallucination stems from several inherent characteristics of LLMs. Trained on vast corpora of internet text, these models learn to generate statistically plausible continuations without necessarily understanding truthfulness or factual accuracy (Chen & Martinez, 2023). Moreover, the autoregressive nature of text generation means errors can propagate and compound as sequences extend. Unlike discriminative models where confidence scores naturally emerge, generative models like LLMs lack built-in mechanisms to signal when they are uncertain about the content they produce.

Current approaches to hallucination mitigation primarily rely on post-generation verification or retrieval-augmented generation. These methods, while valuable, often treat the generation process itself as a black box, applying corrections only after potentially problematic content has already been produced. This reactive approach is inefficient and potentially inadequate for high-stakes applications where preventing misinformation at source is crucial.

### Research Objectives

This research aims to develop and evaluate an Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD) framework that integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the generation process of LLMs. The specific objectives are:

1. To design a token-level uncertainty estimation mechanism that can efficiently quantify confidence during the generation process
2. To develop adaptive intervention strategies that leverage uncertainty signals to reduce hallucination risk while preserving model capabilities
3. To implement a computationally efficient UAD framework that can operate within practical inference time constraints
4. To evaluate the effectiveness of the UAD approach across diverse tasks and domains, particularly those requiring factual reliability
5. To investigate methods for calibrating uncertainty measures and thresholds to optimize the tradeoff between hallucination prevention and generation quality

### Significance

The significance of this research lies in its potential to fundamentally transform how we mitigate hallucinations in LLMs. Rather than treating hallucination as a post-generation problem, our approach integrates uncertainty awareness directly into the decoding process—the core mechanism by which LLMs generate text. This represents a paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive prevention.

If successful, this research will:

1. Provide a generalizable framework for more reliable LLM deployment in high-stakes domains
2. Advance our theoretical understanding of uncertainty in autoregressive generative models
3. Establish new methods for balancing factual reliability with the creative capabilities of LLMs
4. Create new benchmarks and evaluation methods for uncertainty-aware generation systems

As foundation models continue to proliferate across critical applications, integrating uncertainty awareness directly into their generation mechanisms addresses a fundamental need for trustworthy AI systems that know when they don't know.

## 2. Methodology

Our Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD) framework operates as an integrated component within the LLM's decoding loop, monitoring uncertainty at each generation step and intervening when necessary to reduce hallucination risk. The methodology encompasses four key components: (1) Token-level uncertainty estimation, (2) Dynamic threshold calibration, (3) Intervention strategies, and (4) Comprehensive evaluation.

### 2.1 Token-Level Uncertainty Estimation

We propose to implement and compare three methods for estimating uncertainty during the token generation process:

#### 2.1.1 Predictive Entropy

At each decoding step, we calculate the entropy of the predicted token distribution to quantify uncertainty. For a vocabulary of size $V$ and token probabilities $p(x_i)$, the predictive entropy $H$ is computed as:

$$H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{V} p(x_i) \log p(x_i)$$

Higher entropy values indicate greater uncertainty in the model's prediction, potentially signaling an increased risk of hallucination.

#### 2.1.2 Monte Carlo Dropout Uncertainty

We adapt MC dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) for uncertainty estimation by applying dropout during inference. For each token position, we perform $K$ forward passes with different dropout masks and compute:

1. Mean predicted probability for each token:
   $$\bar{p}(x_i) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{j=1}^{K} p_j(x_i)$$

2. Variance of predicted probabilities:
   $$\sigma^2(x_i) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{j=1}^{K} (p_j(x_i) - \bar{p}(x_i))^2$$

3. Uncertainty score as average of variance across top-$n$ tokens:
   $$U_{MC} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sigma^2(x_i)$$

#### 2.1.3 Lightweight Ensemble Disagreement

We implement a lightweight ensemble approach using parameter-efficient adaptation techniques. Specifically, we create $M$ adapter modules (with shared base LLM parameters) and compute:

1. Token probability from each ensemble member $m$: $p_m(x_i)$
2. Mean probability across ensemble: $\bar{p}(x_i) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} p_m(x_i)$
3. Jensen-Shannon divergence between ensemble members as uncertainty measure:
   $$U_{JSD} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} D_{KL}(p_m(x_i) || \bar{p}(x_i))$$

Where $D_{KL}$ represents the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

### 2.2 Dynamic Threshold Calibration

To address the challenge of determining appropriate intervention thresholds, we develop a dynamic calibration approach that adapts based on:

1. **Context-sensitive baseline**: We establish an uncertainty baseline $\beta_c$ for each context $c$ by analyzing historical uncertainty patterns in similar contexts.

2. **Moving window normalization**: For a generation of length $L$, we compute a normalized uncertainty score at position $t$ using a window of size $w$:
   $$U_{norm}(t) = \frac{U(t) - \mu_{t-w:t-1}}{\sigma_{t-w:t-1} + \epsilon}$$
   Where $\mu_{t-w:t-1}$ and $\sigma_{t-w:t-1}$ are the mean and standard deviation of uncertainty scores in the previous $w$ tokens, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant to avoid division by zero.

3. **Adaptive thresholding**: The intervention threshold $\tau$ is dynamically adjusted based on:
   $$\tau(t) = \beta_c \cdot (1 + \alpha \cdot S(t))$$
   Where $S(t)$ is a task-specific scaling factor that modulates threshold stringency based on factors like domain criticality, and $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter controlling adaptation sensitivity.

### 2.3 Intervention Strategies

When the uncertainty score exceeds the threshold ($U(t) > \tau(t)$), our UAD framework employs one of the following intervention strategies:

#### 2.3.1 Evidence-Constrained Sampling

1. Retrieve relevant factual evidence $E = \{e_1, e_2, ..., e_k\}$ from a knowledge source based on the current context.
2. Compute compatibility scores $C(x_i, E)$ between each candidate token $x_i$ and the evidence.
3. Modify the token probability distribution:
   $$p'(x_i) \propto p(x_i) \cdot (1 + \lambda \cdot C(x_i, E))$$
   Where $\lambda$ controls the strength of the evidence-based adjustment.

#### 2.3.2 Uncertainty-Guided Reranking

1. Generate $B$ candidate continuations using beam search or nucleus sampling.
2. For each candidate sequence $S_b$, compute an aggregate uncertainty score:
   $$U_{seq}(S_b) = \frac{1}{|S_b|} \sum_{t=1}^{|S_b|} U(S_b, t)$$
3. Rerank candidates based on a combination of likelihood and uncertainty:
   $$score(S_b) = \log p(S_b) - \gamma \cdot U_{seq}(S_b)$$
   Where $\gamma$ balances between sequence probability and uncertainty.

#### 2.3.3 Uncertainty Signaling

When uncertainty is high but intervention might unnecessarily constrain generation:
1. Insert special tokens indicating uncertainty levels (e.g., [LOW_CONF], [MED_CONF], [HIGH_CONF])
2. Adjust token probabilities to favor uncertainty acknowledgment when appropriate:
   $$p'(x_i) = \begin{cases}
   p(x_i) \cdot (1 - \delta) & \text{if } x_i \neq [CONF_TOKEN] \\
   p(x_i) + \delta & \text{if } x_i = [CONF_TOKEN]
   \end{cases}$$
   Where $\delta$ is proportional to the uncertainty score.
