Title: Uncertainty-Aware Decoding: A Proactive Framework for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks spanning question answering, summarization, machine translation, and dialogue. However, their tendency to generate plausible yet factually incorrect or unsupported statements—known as “hallucinations”—poses a critical barrier to deployment in high‐stakes domains such as healthcare, law, finance, and autonomous systems. Conventional post‐hoc methods for detecting and filtering hallucinations rely on external fact‐checkers or specialized classifiers, often incurring additional latency and failing to catch errors in real time. Meanwhile, users receive the model’s output with high confidence, unaware of latent uncertainty that might indicate an elevated risk of hallucination.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal seeks to develop and evaluate an integrated, decode-time mechanism—Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD)—that quantifies token-level uncertainty inside the LLM’s generation loop and intervenes proactively when uncertainty exceeds a dynamic threshold. The specific objectives are:  
•   To define and compare scalable uncertainty metrics (predictive entropy, Monte Carlo dropout variance, ensemble disagreement) compatible with large autoregressive models.  
•   To design an adaptive thresholding strategy that balances error reduction against creativity preservation.  
•   To integrate three intervention strategies—evidence-constrained sampling, uncertainty-reweighted reranking, and explicit unreliability signaling—into the decoding pipeline.  
•   To conduct comprehensive evaluations on benchmark tasks (factual QA, abstractive summarization) measuring hallucination rate, generation quality, and computational overhead.  

Significance  
By leveraging the model’s own uncertainty signals in real time, UAD aims to reduce hallucination rates without sacrificing fluency or creativity. This work will (1) establish theoretical foundations for decode-time uncertainty quantification, (2) provide practical algorithms and benchmarks for reliable text generation, and (3) inform best practices for deploying LLMs in high-stakes settings where trust and safety are paramount.  

2. Methodology  
2.1 Overview of the UAD Framework  
The Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD) framework augments the standard autoregressive generation loop. At each decoding step $t$, the model produces a probability distribution $P_t = \{p_{t,i}\}_{i=1}^V$ over the vocabulary of size $V$. UAD computes an uncertainty score $U_{t,i}$ for each candidate token $i$, compares the maximum or expected uncertainty to a dynamic threshold $\tau_t$, and, if exceeded, triggers one of three interventions. A schematic outline follows:  
Algorithm 1: UAD‐Enabled Generation  
1.  Initialize generated sequence $y_{<1} = \langle\mathrm{BOS}\rangle$.  
2.  For $t=1$ to $T_{\max}$:  
    a.  Compute $P_t = \mathrm{LLM}(y_{<t})$.  
    b.  Estimate uncertainty scores $\{U_{t,i}\}$ for top‐$k$ tokens.  
    c.  If $\max_i U_{t,i} > \tau_t$, apply intervention to adjust $P_t$;  
        else proceed with standard decoding (e.g., nucleus sampling).  
    d.  Sample or select next token $y_t$ from adjusted distribution.  
    e.  If $y_t = \langle\mathrm{EOS}\rangle$, break.  

2.2 Uncertainty Metrics  
We consider three token-level uncertainty measures:  
1.  Predictive entropy:  
    $$U^{(H)}_{t} = -\sum_{i=1}^V p_{t,i} \log p_{t,i}\,. $$  
2.  MC Dropout variance (with $M$ forward passes under dropout):  
    $$\bar p_{t,i} = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M p_{t,i}^{(m)},\quad
      U^{(\mathrm{Var})}_{t,i} = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M\bigl(p_{t,i}^{(m)}-\bar p_{t,i}\bigr)^2\,. $$  
3.  Ensemble disagreement (with $E$ models):  
    $$\bar p_{t,i} = \frac{1}{E}\sum_{e=1}^E p_{t,i}^{(e)},\quad
      U^{(\mathrm{Ens})}_{t,i} = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^V\bar p_{t,i}^2\,. $$  
In practice, we compute scores only for the top-$k$ tokens (e.g., $k=50$) to limit overhead.  

2.3 Dynamic Threshold Calibration  
An overly static threshold $\tau$ can either suppress creativity or fail to catch errors. We propose an adaptive threshold $\tau_t$ based on the exponential moving average of past entropies:  
$$\tau_t = \mu_{t-1} + \lambda\sigma_{t-1},\quad
  \mu_{t} = \alpha \mu_{t-1} + (1-\alpha)U^{(H)}_{t},\quad
  \sigma_{t} = \alpha \sigma_{t-1} + (1-\alpha)|U^{(H)}_{t}-\mu_{t-1}|\,, $$  
where $\alpha\in[0,1)$ controls smoothing and $\lambda>0$ determines sensitivity. A similar scheme applies to variance or disagreement metrics.  

2.4 Intervention Strategies  
When $\max_i U_{t,i} > \tau_t$, UAD triggers one of:  
1.  Evidence-Constrained Sampling: Retrieve top‐$r$ relevant facts $\{e_j\}$ via a lightweight retriever (e.g., embedding‐based). Mask tokens in $P_t$ that conflict with retrieved facts, renormalize.  
2.  Uncertainty-Reweighted Reranking: Adjust token scores by an exponential penalty on uncertainty:  
   $$p'_{t,i} = \frac{p_{t,i}\exp(-\beta\,U_{t,i})}{\sum_{j=1}^k p_{t,j}\exp(-\beta\,U_{t,j})},\quad
     \beta>0\,. $$  
3.  Unreliability Token Injection: Insert a special token $\langle\mathrm{?}\rangle$ with probability proportional to $\max_i U_{t,i} - \tau_t$, signaling downstream modules or users to treat the continuation with caution.  

The choice of intervention can be selected via a policy network trained with reinforcement learning: the reward balances reduction in hallucinations against a penalty for deviation from fluent text.  

2.5 Experimental Design  
Datasets  
•   Factual QA: Natural Questions (NQ) and TriviaQA.  
•   Abstractive summarization: XSum and CNN/DM.  
•   Controlled hallucination benchmarks: FactCC for summarization.  

Baselines  
•   Standard decoding: greedy, top-$k$, nucleus ($p$=0.9).  
•   Post-hoc filtering: classification model detecting hallucinated sentences.  
•   Existing UQ‐aware decoding (Smith et al. 2023; Kim & O’Connor 2023).  

Metrics  
•   Hallucination Rate ($HR$): percentage of outputs containing at least one factual error, measured via human annotation and automated fact‐checking tools.  
•   Precision/Recall of hallucination detection by UAD ($P_\mathrm{UAD},R_\mathrm{UAD}$).  
•   Generation Quality:  
    – ROUGE‐1/2/L for summarization.  
    – Exact match (EM) and F1 for QA.  
    – BERTScore.  
•   Diversity & Creativity: self-BLEU and distinct‐$n$ metrics.  
•   Computational Overhead: average latency per token ($\Delta t$) and GPU memory overhead.  

Ablations  
•   Impact of each uncertainty metric.  
•   Effect of threshold hyperparameters ($\alpha,\lambda$).  
•   Comparison among the three interventions.  

Implementation Details  
•   Base model: GPT-2 Large (774M) and GPT-3‐style decoder (1.3B).  
•   MC Dropout: dropout rate 0.1, $M=10$ passes.  
•   Ensemble: $E=3$ truncated checkpoints.  
•   Retriever: DPR embeddings with FAISS indexing, $r=5$ facts.  
•   Policy network: two-layer MLP trained via PPO with reward  
   $$R = -\mathbf{1}\{\text{hallucination}\} -\gamma\cdot\text{fluency\_loss}\,, $$  
   where $\gamma$ trades off.  

Statistical Analysis  
We will run each configuration with 5 random seeds, reporting mean and standard deviation. Paired $t$-tests will determine significance ($p<0.05$).  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate that UAD will achieve a substantial reduction in hallucination rates—20–40% relative to standard sampling—while preserving over 95% of baseline fluency (measured by BERTScore) and incurring under 15% additional inference latency. Specifically:  
•   Predictive entropy combined with uncertainty-reweighted reranking is expected to offer the best trade-off between error reduction and creative diversity.  
•   Dynamic thresholding will adapt to domain shifts, outperforming fixed thresholds by 10–15% in unseen task settings.  
•   Evidence-constrained sampling will further eliminate hard factual errors at the cost of a modest fluency drop, beneficial for applications requiring near-perfect accuracy.  

Broader Impacts  
By embedding UQ inside the generation loop, our framework moves beyond passive detection toward active risk management in LLM outputs. The resulting algorithms and benchmarks will serve practitioners in healthcare (clinical report generation), law (contract drafting), and finance (automated analysis), where hallucinations are unacceptable. We will release:  
1.   An open-source UAD toolkit compatible with Hugging Face Transformers.  
2.   A benchmark suite with standardized hallucination annotations.  
3.   Guidelines for threshold calibration and intervention selection.  

Long-term, this research will catalyze a shift in LLM development—from maximizing likelihood to managing uncertainty—paving the way for trustworthy AI systems capable of self‐aware, risk‐sensitive text generation.
