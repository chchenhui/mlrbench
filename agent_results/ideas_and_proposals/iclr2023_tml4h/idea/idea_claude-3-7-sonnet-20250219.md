# Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Multi-Institutional Healthcare Collaboration

## Motivation
Healthcare institutions possess valuable patient data but face regulatory constraints in sharing it directly. Traditional centralized machine learning approaches require data pooling, risking privacy violations and limiting cross-institutional collaboration. This research addresses the critical need for privacy-preserving methods that enable multiple healthcare organizations to collaboratively build robust ML models without exchanging raw patient data, thus maintaining compliance with regulations like HIPAA while advancing medical knowledge through collective intelligence.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel federated learning framework specifically designed for multi-institutional healthcare settings that incorporates differential privacy guarantees and homomorphic encryption. The approach allows hospitals to train shared models on their local data while only exchanging encrypted model updates. Our innovation combines secure aggregation techniques with adaptive noise injection calibrated to clinical significance thresholds, ensuring that privacy leakage remains below regulatory requirements while preserving model utility for medical applications. The framework includes specialized mechanisms to handle class imbalance and institution-specific data distributions common in healthcare datasets. Through this approach, healthcare institutions can collaboratively develop models for rare diseases or diverse populations without compromising patient privacy, ultimately accelerating the development of more generalizable and trustworthy ML systems for clinical applications.
