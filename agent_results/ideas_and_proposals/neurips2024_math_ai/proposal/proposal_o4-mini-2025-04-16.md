Title  
Adaptive Mathematical Reasoning Assessment via Dynamic Procedural Problem Generation  

1. Introduction  
1.1 Background and Motivation  
Evaluating the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) has become a cornerstone of modern AI research. Static benchmarks such as MATH [1] and GSM8K [2] provide important reference points, but they suffer from two critical limitations:  
  • Data contamination: As LLMs ingest massive corpora, they often encounter and memorize benchmark problems, leading to inflated scores that reflect recall rather than genuine reasoning.  
  • Limited coverage and adaptivity: Static test‐sets cannot probe fine‐grained aspects of reasoning, nor can they adjust difficulty to the model’s evolving capabilities.  

Recent work on dynamic benchmarks (Mathador‐LM [3], Contamination‐Resistant Benchmarks [8]) and adaptive item‐response methods (TATA [4], Adaptive Difficulty Adjustment [9]) suggests that procedural content generation (PCG) can supply an endless supply of fresh problem instances tailored to specific reasoning skills. Yet, a fully integrated framework that (a) uses PCG to control problem attributes, (b) dynamically adapts difficulty based on performance, and (c) evaluates both final‐answer accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning steps remains an open challenge.  

1.2 Research Objectives  
We propose to develop an end‐to‐end system, called Adaptive MathEval, which generates, delivers, and evaluates mathematical problems in a feedback loop that continuously diagnoses an LLM’s strengths and weaknesses. Our objectives are:  
  1. To design a domain‐specific template language and procedural‐generation engine that can produce mathematically valid problems of controllable difficulty across algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and logical deduction.  
  2. To implement an adaptive testing algorithm that selects problem parameters in real time based on the model’s previous responses, maximizing information gain about latent reasoning skills.  
  3. To integrate fine‐grained reasoning‐quality metrics (inspired by ReasonEval [5]) to assess not only correctness but also the validity, coherence, and efficiency of solution steps.  
  4. To demonstrate that Adaptive MathEval is robust to dataset contamination and provides richer diagnostic profiles than existing static and dynamic benchmarks.  

1.3 Significance  
By moving beyond static leaderboards, Adaptive MathEval will:  
  • Provide contamination‐resistant, never‐ending assessment suites.  
  • Offer fine‐grained diagnostic feedback for curriculum learning and model improvement.  
  • Serve as a testbed for human–machine collaboration by generating problems that complement human intuitions.  
  • Inform best practices for evaluating next‐generation LLMs on genuine mathematical reasoning tasks.  

2. Methodology  
2.1 System Overview  
Adaptive MathEval consists of four interacting modules:  
  A. Template Library  
  B. Problem Generator  
  C. Adaptive Selector  
  D. Reasoning‐Quality Evaluator  

2.2 Template Library  
We define a set of problem templates $T=\{t_i\}$, each parameterized by a vector $\theta\in\Theta_i$. For example, an algebra template might be  
  “Solve for $x$ in $a\,x + b = c$,”  
with $\theta=(a,b,c)\in\mathbb{Z}^3$ subject to $a\neq0$. A geometry template could be  
  “Given a circle of radius $r$ and a chord at distance $d$ from the center, compute the chord length.”  

Each template $t_i$ is annotated with:  
  – A difficulty function $\delta_i:\Theta_i\to\mathbb{R}^+$,  
  – A set of reasoning skills $\mathcal{S}_i\subset\{\text{algebra}, \text{geometry}, \dots\}$,  
  – A validity predicate $V_i(\theta)$ ensuring the instance is well‐formed (e.g., $d<r$).  

2.3 Problem Generation  
Given a template $t_i$ and a target difficulty $D>0$, we sample $\theta\sim p_i(\theta\mid|\delta_i(\theta)-D|\le\epsilon,V_i(\theta))$. In practice, we discretize difficulty into bins and precompute a table of $(\theta,\delta_i(\theta))$ pairs to support rejection sampling or importance sampling.  

2.4 Adaptive Selection Algorithm  
We model an LLM’s latent ability on skill $s\in\mathcal{S}$ as $\alpha_s\in\mathbb{R}$. We wish to choose the next problem (template index $i$, parameters $\theta$, difficulty $D$) to maximize expected information gain about $(\alpha_s)_{s\in\mathcal{S}_i}$. Let $r\in\{0,1\}$ denote the event “model solves correctly and with high‐quality reasoning.” We approximate mutual information  
$$
\mathrm{IG}(i,\theta,D) \;=\; \mathbb{E}_{r}\Big[\mathrm{KL}\big(p(\alpha\mid\mathcal{H},r)\,\|\,p(\alpha\mid\mathcal{H})\big)\Big],
$$  
where $\mathcal{H}$ is the history of past interactions. In practice, we deploy a variational approximation using an item‐response model (IRM) [9]:  
$$
\Pr(r=1\mid \alpha_s, D) \;=\; \sigma\big(\gamma_s(\alpha_s - D)\big),
$$  
with skill‐specific discrimination $\gamma_s>0$ and logistic link $\sigma(x)=1/(1+e^{-x})$. We update posterior $p(\alpha_s\mid\mathcal{H})$ via Bayesian updating at each trial, and select $(i,\theta,D)$ that maximizes estimated IG.  

Algorithm 1 (Adaptive Loop):  
  1. Initialize priors $p_0(\alpha_s)\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ for each skill $s$.  
  2. For $t=1,\dots,N$ trials:  
     a. For each candidate $(i,\theta,D)$, estimate $\mathrm{IG}_t(i,\theta,D)$.  
     b. Select $(i^*,\theta^*,D^*)=\arg\max\mathrm{IG}_t$.  
     c. Generate problem $P_t=t_{i^*}(\theta^*)$.  
     d. Query LLM to produce a step‐by‐step solution.  
     e. Evaluate response: correct answer? solution steps valid?  
     f. Update posterior $p_{t}(\alpha_s)$ via Bayes’ rule under IRM.  

2.5 Reasoning‐Quality Evaluation  
Building on ReasonEval [5], we define three step‐level metrics:  
  • Validity ($V_{\mathrm{step}}$): fraction of steps that follow logically from previous steps.  
  • Redundancy ($R_{\mathrm{step}}$): measure of irrelevant or repeated steps.  
  • Efficiency ($E_{\mathrm{step}}$): ratio of minimal step‐count to actual step‐count.  

For each solution we compute a composite score  
$$
Q_\mathrm{reasoning} \;=\; w_v\,V_{\mathrm{step}} \;-\; w_r\,R_{\mathrm{step}} \;+\; w_e\,E_{\mathrm{step}},
$$  
where $(w_v,w_r,w_e)$ are weights tuned on a held‐out validation set.

2.6 Contamination Resistance  
To ensure problems are novel, we maintain a “seen‐template” registry. We only sample $\theta$ pairs that lie outside any known training splits of public benchmarks. Whenever a user suspects contamination, we can regenerate with different random seeds and parameter bins to guarantee fresh content.

2.7 Implementation Details  
  • Language: Python 3.10 with NumPy/PyTorch for posterior inference.  
  • LLM interface: OpenAI API (GPT‐4, GPT‐3.5), Anthropic Claude, and local LLaMA‐2.  
  • Template storage: JSON schema with parameter ranges and metadata.  
  • Evaluation harness: automated parser plus human spot‐checks on 5% of instances.  
  • Data logging: all prompts, responses, and evaluation scores stored in a secure database.  

3. Experimental Design  
3.1 Baselines  
  1. Static Benchmark: 1,000 problems drawn from MATH and GSM8K.  
  2. Existing Dynamic Benchmarks: Mathador‐LM [3], Dynamic Problem Generation [6].  
  3. Non‐adaptive PCG: Procedural Generation without adaptive selection (random sampling of $D$).  

3.2 Models Under Test  
We will evaluate:  
  – GPT‐4 (API)  
  – GPT‐3.5‐Turbo (API)  
  – Claude‐2 (API)  
  – LLaMA‐2‐Chat (local)  
  – CodeLlama (local)  

3.3 Evaluation Metrics  
  • Final‐answer accuracy $\mathrm{Acc} = \frac{\#\{\text{correct answers}\}}{\#\{\text{total}\}}$.  
  • Reasoning quality score $Q_{\mathrm{reasoning}}$ (mean and distribution).  
  • Test–retest reliability (Cronbach’s $\alpha$ across repeated runs).  
  • Calibration error: Brier score of $\Pr(r=1\mid\hat\alpha, D)$.  
  • Generalization gap: $\Delta_{\mathrm{gen}}$ between accuracy on known‐template vs novel‐template problems.  

3.4 Protocol  
  1. Warm‐up: Run 100 non‐adaptive PCG problems to initialize priors.  
  2. Adaptive Phase: 900 trials under the adaptive loop.  
  3. Repeat protocol five times per model to estimate variance.  
  4. Aggregate: compute all metrics, compare against baselines using paired t‐tests and ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.  

3.5 Ablation Studies  
  – Remove reasoning‐quality evaluator: measure drop in diagnostic precision.  
  – Replace IRM‐based selection with uniform random difficulty: quantify loss in information gain.  
  – Vary template diversity (number of templates from 10 to 50).  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
4.1 Anticipated Results  
  • Adaptive MathEval will achieve higher test–retest reliability (Cronbach’s $\alpha>0.9$) than static benchmarks ($\alpha\approx0.75$).  
  • The adaptive loop will reduce generalization gap $\Delta_{\mathrm{gen}}$ by at least 30% relative to static and non‐adaptive PCG.  
  • Fine‐grained reasoning‐quality scores will reveal weaknesses in common LLMs (e.g., over‐reliance on pattern matching in algebraic manipulation, under‐utilization of geometric invariants).  
  • Information‐gain curves will demonstrate efficient measurement of latent abilities, requiring 40% fewer problems to reach a stable estimate of $\alpha_s$ than non‐adaptive PCG.

4.2 Broader Impact  
  – For AI research: Provides a benchmark suite that cannot be “solved” by memorization, pushing models toward genuine reasoning.  
  – For education: The same PCG engine can power adaptive tutoring systems that generate problems calibrated to a student’s skill profile.  
  – For safety and verification: Dynamic problem generation can test symbolic and numerical solvers under adversarial conditions, improving robustness in engineering and finance.  
  – For workshop organizers: Serves as a demonstration of next‐generation evaluation methods in the Workshop on Mathematical Reasoning and AI.

5. Conclusion & Future Work  
We have outlined a comprehensive research plan for Adaptive MathEval, a dynamic, contamination‐resistant, and diagnostically rich assessment framework for mathematical reasoning in LLMs. By uniting procedural content generation, item‐response theory, and reasoning‐quality evaluation, we will obtain a deep understanding of model capabilities and guide the development of more robust, interpretable, and cooperative AI systems. Future extensions include:  
  • Multi‐modal problem generation (e.g., diagrams, interactive proofs).  
  • Human–AI co‐reasoning studies, where the system adapts to a mixed human/LLM solver.  
  • Application to higher mathematics (real analysis, topology) via proof‐assistant integration.
