**Title:** Adaptive Concept-aware Tutoring Systems (ACTS) for Personalized Mathematics Education  

**Motivation:** Mathematics education in resource-limited settings often lacks personalized guidance, hindering conceptual mastery. While LLMs excel at problem-solving, they rarely address *why* a studentâ€™s answer is wrong or adapt to individual misconceptions. Bridging this gap could democratize access to quality education and improve foundational math literacy globally.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a hybrid LLM-based tutoring system that integrates dynamic problem generation with conceptual feedback. The system would:  
1. **Diagnose Misconceptions:** Analyze student responses using LLMs fine-tuned on common errors and conceptual hierarchies (e.g., misapplying distributive property) to identify gaps.  
2. **Adaptive Scaffolding:** Generate tailored explanations (e.g., visual analogies, step-by-step breakdowns) and adjust problem difficulty based on real-time performance.  
3. **Curriculum Alignment:** Train on diverse, culturally relevant datasets with annotated misconceptions, paired with reinforcement learning to optimize pedagogical strategies.  

Expected outcomes include improved learning efficiency and retention in pilot studies, particularly in under-resourced classrooms. Long-term, ACTS could reduce dependency on human tutors, scale personalized learning, and provide insights into cognitive processes underlying mathematical mastery.
