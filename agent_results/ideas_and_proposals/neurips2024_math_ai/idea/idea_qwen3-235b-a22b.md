**Title:** Adaptive Mathematical Reasoning Tutoring via Reinforcement Learning with LLM-Generated Feedback  

**Motivation:** Access to personalized math education remains limited in underserved regions, and existing automated tutors struggle to adapt dynamically to individual learning gaps. Traditional systems often provide static explanations, failing to address nuanced errors or foster deep conceptual understanding.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a hybrid model combining large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) to create an adaptive, interactive math tutoring system. The LLM will generate step-by-step solutions, error-specific feedback, and dynamically reformulated problems in symbolic (LaTeX) and textual formats. The RL framework will track student progress, prioritize under-practiced concepts, and adjust problem difficulty based on response patterns. Methodology includes pretraining on curated proof-based math datasets (e.g., Olympiad problems) and fine-tuning via human-AI collaborative labeling of common misconceptions. The system will incorporate a “relevance feedback” loop where student corrections refine future interactions. Expected outcomes include a 20–30% improvement in problem-solving accuracy over static models in low-resource settings, validated through benchmark tests (e.g., MATH dataset) and real-world pilot programs. Impact: Democratizing access to personalized math education, enabling scalable, cognitively grounded tutoring that bridges gaps in abstract reasoning for learners lacking access to expert mentors.
