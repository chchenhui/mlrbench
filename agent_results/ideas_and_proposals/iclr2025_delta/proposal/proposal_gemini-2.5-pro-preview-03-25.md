## 1. Title: Topology-Aware Latent Space Regularization for Enhanced Expressivity and Robustness in Deep Generative Models

## 2. Introduction

**Background:** Deep Generative Models (DGMs), such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [Goodfellow et al., 2014] and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [Kingma & Welling, 2013], have demonstrated remarkable success in generating high-fidelity data across various domains, including images, text, and audio. These models typically learn a mapping from a low-dimensional latent space, often assumed to have a simple prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian), to the high-dimensional data space. The structure of this latent space and the mapping function are critical determinants of the model's ability to capture the underlying distribution of the data, perform meaningful interpolations, and generalize effectively.

However, a fundamental challenge persists: the geometry and topology of the learned latent space often fail to accurately reflect the intrinsic structure of the data manifold [Zhou et al., 2020; Ross et al., 2022]. Real-world data often resides on complex, non-Euclidean manifolds with non-trivial topological features (e.g., clusters, holes, voids). Standard training objectives, primarily focused on minimizing reconstruction error or fooling a discriminator, do not explicitly enforce topological consistency between the data manifold and the latent representation. This misalignment can lead to several limitations:
*   **Poor Interpolation:** Interpolating between points in the latent space may traverse regions corresponding to low data density or generate unrealistic samples [Grover et al., 2018].
*   **Limited Extrapolation:** Generating plausible samples beyond the immediate vicinity of the training data (out-of-distribution generation) is often unreliable.
*   **Suboptimal Expressivity:** The model might struggle to represent data distributions with complex topological structures accurately.
*   **Vulnerability:** The model may be sensitive to perturbations, both in the input space and the latent space.

**Problem Statement:** The core problem addressed by this research is the lack of explicit topological awareness in the latent space learning process of conventional DGMs. This deficiency hinders their ability to learn representations that faithfully capture the underlying structure of the data manifold, limiting their performance in tasks requiring nuanced understanding of data variations and relationships.

**Proposed Research:** This research proposes a novel approach to designing DGMs by incorporating principles from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). Specifically, we aim to develop a **Topology-Aware Latent Space Regularization (TALSR)** framework. The central idea is to leverage Persistent Homology (PH) [Edelsbrunner & Harer, 2010], a cornerstone of TDA, to extract robust topological signatures (e.g., connected components, cycles, voids) from the input data manifold. These signatures will then be used to define a regularization term that explicitly encourages the DGM's latent space to preserve these essential topological features. By integrating this topological constraint into the model's training objective, we hypothesize that the resulting latent space will better reflect the intrinsic structure of the data, leading to improved model properties.

**Related Work:** Recent years have seen growing interest in integrating topological concepts into deep learning [Hajij et al., 2022; Zia et al., 2023]. Several works have started exploring topology in generative modeling context. For instance, TopoDiffusionNet [Gupta et al., 2024] and the work by Hu et al. [2024] incorporate topological priors into diffusion models, primarily focusing on guiding the generation process towards specific topological outcomes. Ross et al. [2022] proposed modeling data manifolds as neural implicit manifolds with topological constraints. Zheng et al. [2024] developed TopoLa for network embedding using topological information. GAGA [Sun et al., 2024] focuses on learning warped Riemannian metrics for geometry-aware generation. Zhou et al. [2020] used topology to *evaluate* disentanglement. While these works highlight the potential of topology, our approach differs by proposing an explicit *regularization* mechanism directly targeting the preservation of data manifold topology (as captured by PH) within the latent space representation of standard DGM frameworks like VAEs or GANs, aiming for broader applicability and improved fundamental properties like interpolation and robustness.

**Research Objectives:**
1.  Develop a method to efficiently extract relevant topological features from high-dimensional data or mini-batches using Persistent Homology.
2.  Formulate a differentiable (or approximately differentiable) loss term based on distances between topological summaries (e.g., persistence diagrams) of the input data and the latent representations.
3.  Integrate this topological regularization term into the training objectives of standard DGMs (e.g., VAEs, GANs).
4.  Implement and train the proposed topology-aware DGMs on benchmark and synthetic datasets with varying topological complexity.
5.  Rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed models against baseline DGMs and relevant topology-aware methods, focusing on generation quality, interpolation coherence, robustness, and topological feature preservation in the latent space.

**Significance:** This research addresses a fundamental limitation in deep generative modeling by bridging the gap between the learned latent representations and the intrinsic topological structure of data. Success in this research would lead to:
*   **Improved DGM Expressivity:** Enabling models to better capture and generate data from distributions with complex topologies.
*   **Enhanced Latent Space Structure:** Facilitating more meaningful interpolations and potentially better disentanglement of factors of variation.
*   **Increased Robustness:** Developing models potentially less sensitive to noise and adversarial perturbations due to a more structured latent space.
*   **Advancing Theoretical Understanding:** Contributing to the understanding of latent space geometry and its role in DGM performance, directly aligning with the workshop themes of expressivity, latent space geometry, robustness, and generalization.
*   **Broader Applications:** Potentially benefiting downstream tasks such as data augmentation, anomaly detection, and generative modeling for scientific discovery where preserving structural integrity is crucial.

## 3. Methodology

This section details the proposed methodology, including the base DGM architecture, topological feature extraction, the novel regularization term, the training procedure, and the experimental validation plan.

**3.1. Base DGM Architecture:**

We will primarily focus on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework due to its explicit encoder $E_\phi$ mapping data $x$ to latent codes $z$ and decoder $D_\theta$ mapping $z$ back to data space $\hat{x}$. The encoder outputs parameters (mean $\mu_\phi(x)$ and variance $\sigma^2_\phi(x)$) for the approximate posterior distribution $q_\phi(z|x) = \mathcal{N}(z | \mu_\phi(x), \sigma^2_\phi(x)I)$. The prior $p(z)$ is typically a standard Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$. The standard VAE objective is the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):
$$
\mathcal{L}_{VAE}(\phi, \theta; x) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(x|z)] - \beta D_{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p(z))
$$
where the first term is the reconstruction log-likelihood and the second is the KL divergence between the approximate posterior and the prior, weighted by $\beta$ (for $\beta$-VAE [Higgins et al., 2017]). We will also consider applying the proposed regularization to GAN architectures, potentially by regularizing the distribution of points in the latent space $z \sim p(z)$ mapped through the generator compared to generated samples $G(z)$, or by regularizing the encoder's output in encoder-based GANs (e.g., BiGAN [Donahue et al., 2016]).

**3.2. Topological Feature Extraction using Persistent Homology (PH):**

Persistent Homology (PH) is a method from TDA used to compute and summarize topological features (connected components, loops, voids, etc.) of data at different spatial resolutions.

*   **Input Data:** Given a point cloud $P$ (either a mini-batch of input data $X_{batch}$ or corresponding latent representations $Z_{batch} = E_\phi(X_{batch})$).
*   **Filtration:** Construct a sequence of nested simplicial complexes (e.g., Vietoris-Rips complex) $K_0 \subseteq K_{\epsilon_1} \subseteq ... \subseteq K_{\epsilon_m}$ based on a proximity parameter $\epsilon$. For a Vietoris-Rips complex $VR(P, \epsilon)$, vertices are points in $P$, and a set of $k+1$ vertices forms a $k$-simplex if all pairwise distances are less than $\epsilon$.
*   **Persistence Calculation:** As $\epsilon$ increases, topological features (like connected components - dimension 0, loops - dimension 1, voids - dimension 2, etc.) appear and disappear. PH tracks these features across the filtration, recording their "birth" time $\epsilon_{birth}$ and "death" time $\epsilon_{death}$.
*   **Persistence Diagram (PD):** The lifetimes of these features are summarized in a persistence diagram $PD(P) = \{ ( \epsilon_{birth, i}, \epsilon_{death, i} ) \}_i$, a multiset of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Points far from the diagonal $y=x$ represent persistent (potentially significant) topological features. We typically focus on dimensions 0 and 1 ($H_0$, $H_1$) for computational feasibility, corresponding to clusters and loops.
*   **Computation:** We will use established libraries like GUDHI [Maria et al., 2014], Dionysus [Morozov, 2012], or Ripser [Bauer, 2021] for PH computations.

**Challenge & Mitigation:** Computing PH for high-dimensional data $X_{batch}$ within each training step is computationally expensive. Potential mitigations include:
1.  Applying PH only to the lower-dimensional latent space $Z_{batch}$.
2.  Applying PH to a lower-dimensional projection of $X_{batch}$ (e.g., using PCA or random projections) that aims to preserve topology.
3.  Using subsampling or landmark-based methods (e.g., witness complexes) to approximate the topology of $X_{batch}$.
4.  Pre-computing a target topological signature $PD_{target}$ from the entire dataset (or a large representative sample) once, and regularizing the topology of latent batches $Z_{batch}$ towards this target. (We will initially explore option 1 and 3 due to their dynamic nature within training batches).

**3.3. Topology-Aware Latent Space Regularization (TALSR):**

The core of our proposal is the TALSR term, $\mathcal{L}_{topo}$, designed to minimize the discrepancy between the topological features of the input data (or its representation) and the latent space embedding.

Let $PD(X_{batch}^*)$ be the persistence diagram computed from the input mini-batch (or its suitable representation, denoted by $X_{batch}^*$) and $PD(Z_{batch})$ be the persistence diagram computed from the corresponding latent samples $Z_{batch} = E_\phi(X_{batch})$. We propose a regularization term based on a distance metric between these diagrams. Common choices include:

*   **Bottleneck Distance ($d_B$):** Measures the worst-case mismatch between points in two diagrams.
    $$
    d_B(PD_1, PD_2) = \inf_{\eta: PD_1 \to PD_2} \sup_{p \in PD_1} ||p - \eta(p)||_{\infty}
    $$
    where $\eta$ is a bijection (allowing points mapped to the diagonal).
*   **Wasserstein Distance ($d_W^{(p)}$):** Measures the optimal transport cost between diagrams. For $p \ge 1$:
    $$
    d_W^{(p)}(PD_1, PD_2) = \left( \inf_{\eta: PD_1 \to PD_2} \sum_{p \in PD_1} ||p - \eta(p)||_{\infty}^p \right)^{1/p}
    $$

We will primarily use the p-Wasserstein distance (typically $p=1$ or $p=2$) due to its stability and potential for smoother gradients compared to the bottleneck distance. The topological regularization term is then:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{topo}(\phi; X_{batch}) = \sum_{k} w_k d_W^{(p_k)}(PD_k(X_{batch}^*), PD_k(Z_{batch}))
$$
where $k$ indexes the homology dimension (e.g., $k=0, 1$), $w_k$ are weights balancing the importance of different dimensions, and $p_k$ is the order of the Wasserstein distance for dimension $k$.

**Differentiability:** The PH computation itself is non-differentiable. However, recent works have proposed differentiable layers or loss functions based on persistence diagrams [Hofer et al., 2017; Carrière et al., 2020]. We will leverage these techniques or employ straight-through estimators or relaxation methods to enable end-to-end training via backpropagation. If direct differentiation proves too complex or unstable, we may explore policy gradient methods or alternating optimization schemes.

**3.4. Modified Training Objective:**

The final training objective for our Topology-Aware VAE (TopoVAE) integrates the TALSR term:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{Total}(\phi, \theta; x) = \mathcal{L}_{VAE}(\phi, \theta; x) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{topo}(\phi; x)
$$
where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter controlling the strength of the topological regularization. For GANs, $\mathcal{L}_{topo}$ could be added to the generator's loss, potentially comparing the topology of generated samples $G(z)$ with real data $x$, or comparing the topology of encoded real data $E(x)$ with the latent prior $z$ if using an encoder.

**3.5. Algorithmic Steps (TopoVAE Example):**

1.  Initialize VAE parameters $\phi, \theta$ and regularization strength $\lambda$.
2.  **For** each training iteration:
    a.  Sample a mini-batch of data $X_{batch} \sim p_{data}(x)$.
    b.  **Encoder Pass:** Compute latent distribution parameters $\mu_\phi(X_{batch}), \sigma^2_\phi(X_{batch})$.
    c.  Sample latent vectors: $Z_{batch} \sim q_\phi(z|X_{batch})$ using the reparameterization trick $z = \mu_\phi + \sigma_\phi \odot \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.
    d.  **Decoder Pass:** Reconstruct data $\hat{X}_{batch} = D_\theta(Z_{batch})$.
    e.  **Compute VAE Loss:** Calculate $\mathcal{L}_{VAE}$ (reconstruction loss + KL divergence).
    f.  **Compute Topological Features:**
        i.  Determine the input representation for PH: $X_{batch}^*$ (e.g., $X_{batch}$, PCA projection, or subset).
        ii. Compute $PD_k(X_{batch}^*)$ for relevant dimensions $k$.
        iii. Compute $PD_k(Z_{batch})$ for relevant dimensions $k$.
    g.  **Compute Topological Loss:** Calculate $\mathcal{L}_{topo} = \sum_k w_k d_W^{(p_k)}(PD_k(X_{batch}^*), PD_k(Z_{batch}))$ using a (sub)differentiable distance implementation.
    h.  **Compute Total Loss:** $\mathcal{L}_{Total} = \mathcal{L}_{VAE} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{topo}$.
    i.  **Parameter Update:** Update $\phi, \theta$ using gradients $\nabla_{\phi, \theta} \mathcal{L}_{Total}$ via an optimizer (e.g., Adam).
3.  **End For**.

**3.6. Experimental Design and Evaluation:**

*   **Datasets:**
    *   *Synthetic Data:* Datasets with known topology (e.g., points sampled from a circle, sphere, torus, figure-eight, multiple clusters) to provide ground truth validation.
    *   *Benchmark Image Datasets:* MNIST (simple topology), FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10 (more complex structures, classes might form clusters), CelebA (faces, potentially complex manifold).
    *   *Scientific Data (Potential):* Molecular conformation data or cosmological simulation data where topology is meaningful.
*   **Baselines:**
    *   Standard VAE / $\beta$-VAE.
    *   Standard GAN / WGAN-GP.
    *   Relevant topology-aware methods (e.g., reimplementation based on GAGA [Sun et al., 2024] principles, or simpler topological constraints if full methods are complex).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Generation Quality:** Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS) for image data. Visual inspection of generated samples.
    *   **Reconstruction Quality:** Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) for VAEs.
    *   **Latent Space Topology Preservation:**
        *   Compute $d_W$ or $d_B$ between the persistence diagrams of the full test set (or large sample) and samples from the learned latent space ($Z = E(X_{test})$ or $z \sim p(z)$ for GANs). Compare this distance with baselines.
        *   Compare Betti numbers ($\beta_0, \beta_1, ...$) computed from data and latent representations.
        *   Visualize latent space embeddings (using t-SNE/UMAP) colored by class labels or known data features to qualitatively assess structure preservation.
    *   **Interpolation Quality:**
        *   Generate samples by linearly interpolating between latent codes $z_1, z_2$ of two real data points $x_1, x_2$. Visually assess the realism and smoothness of the transition.
        *   Quantify interpolation quality: Measure the classification consistency (if applicable) of interpolated samples using a pre-trained classifier, or measure path length in data space vs. latent space. Develop a metric to assess if interpolations stay close to the data manifold (e.g., using reconstruction error of interpolated points).
    *   **Robustness:** Evaluate the model's performance (e.g., generation quality, reconstruction) under noise or small adversarial perturbations added to the input data or the latent codes. Assess the stability of topological features of generated samples under perturbation.
    *   **Computational Cost:** Measure training time and PH computation overhead.

*   **Ablation Studies:** We will perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components:
    *   Impact of the weight $\lambda$.
    *   Effect of using different homology dimensions ($H_0$ vs. $H_1$).
    *   Comparison of different PD distance metrics ($d_B$ vs. $d_W$).
    *   Impact of different PH computation strategies (on $X_{batch}$, $Z_{batch}$, projections).

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact

**Expected Outcomes:**

1.  **Topologically Aligned Latent Spaces:** We expect the proposed TALSR framework to produce DGMs whose latent spaces exhibit topological structures (quantified by persistence diagrams and Betti numbers) that are demonstrably more similar to the input data manifold compared to standard VAEs/GANs and potentially other baseline methods. Visualizations of the latent space are expected to show better separation of clusters or preservation of cyclic structures present in the data.
2.  **Improved Interpolation:** By enforcing topological consistency, we anticipate that interpolations between points in the latent space will correspond to more realistic and meaningful transitions in the data space, avoiding regions of low data density and generating higher-fidelity intermediate samples. This will be verified both visually and quantitatively.
3.  **Enhanced Generation Quality & Diversity:** While the primary goal is structural alignment, we hypothesize this improved latent representation may indirectly lead to better generation quality (e.g., lower FID scores) and potentially improved diversity, as the model better captures the underlying manifold support.
4.  **Increased Robustness:** A latent space that better reflects the data manifold's topology might be inherently more robust to small perturbations. We expect models trained with TALSR to show greater resilience to noise or adversarial attacks in their generative capabilities compared to baselines.
5.  **Quantifiable Trade-offs:** The experiments will quantify the trade-offs between topological alignment, generation quality, reconstruction accuracy, and computational cost introduced by the TALSR framework. We expect to identify optimal ranges for the hyperparameter $\lambda$.

**Impact:**

This research stands to make significant contributions to the field of deep generative modeling and its intersection with topological data analysis.

*   **Theoretical Advancement:** It will provide new insights into how explicit topological constraints influence the learning dynamics and resulting representations of DGMs. This directly addresses the workshop's interest in "Latent Space Geometry and Manifold Learning," "Expressivity," and "Robustness and Generalization Boundaries." By successfully regularizing the latent space using PH-derived metrics, we contribute a novel technique for controlling and understanding the geometric properties learned by DGMs.
*   **Methodological Innovation:** The TALSR framework offers a new tool for designing DGMs. If successful, it provides a principled way to incorporate prior knowledge about data structure (its topology) into the model learning process, potentially mitigating known failure modes of standard DGMs related to manifold representation.
*   **Practical Benefits:** Models with topologically aware latent spaces could be highly valuable in applications where structural integrity and meaningful variability are crucial. This includes:
    *   *Scientific Discovery (AI4Science):* Modeling complex biological structures (proteins, molecules), cosmological data, or fluid dynamics where topology plays a critical role.
    *   *Computer Vision and Graphics:* Generating more realistic variations of objects, better data augmentation preserving shape characteristics, and improved style transfer or image editing.
    *   *Anomaly Detection:* A topologically faithful latent space might make out-of-distribution or anomalous samples more easily detectable.
*   **Addressing Key Challenges:** This work directly tackles the documented challenge of aligning latent space structure with data topology. While it might increase computational complexity (another key challenge), the explicit focus on topology offers a potential pathway to improved stability and interpretability (by linking latent features to measurable topological properties).
*   **Future Research Directions:** This research may open up further investigations into using richer TDA descriptors, exploring topology-aware metrics beyond latent spaces (e.g., in feature spaces of discriminators), and applying these concepts to other generative architectures like normalizing flows and diffusion models, building upon initial efforts like TopoDiffusionNet but with a focus on regularization during representation learning.

In conclusion, this research proposes a principled and novel approach to enhance deep generative models by explicitly aligning their latent space topology with that of the data manifold using persistent homology. By addressing fundamental limitations in latent space structure, we anticipate significant improvements in model expressivity, interpolation quality, and robustness, with broad implications for both the theory and application of DGMs. This work aligns perfectly with the core themes of the ICLR 2025 Workshop on Deep Generative Models.
