Title: TopoGAN – Topology-Aware Manifold Regularization for Deep Generative Models

Motivation:  
Deep generative models often learn latent spaces that distort intrinsic topological features of the data manifold, leading to poor sample diversity, unstable training, and limited generalization. By explicitly regularizing manifold topology during training, we can preserve crucial geometric structures—such as loops, clusters, and handles—improving both expressivity and robustness.

Main Idea:  
We propose TopoGAN, a GAN framework augmented with a differentiable topological regularizer based on persistent homology. During each training iteration, we:  
1. Sample a mini-batch of real and generated examples;  
2. Compute approximate persistence diagrams for both distributions using efficient cubical complexes on feature embeddings;  
3. Define a topological loss term as the Wasserstein distance between these diagrams, penalizing birth–death deviations of topological features;  
4. Integrate this loss into the generator objective alongside the adversarial loss.  

Expected outcomes include latent embeddings that better mirror the true data topology, yielding higher-quality samples, improved mode coverage, and enhanced stability. This approach can be applied to VAEs or flows, offering a general mechanism to enforce manifold-aware regularization in deep generative modeling.
