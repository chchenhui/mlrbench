# Geometry-Aware Sampling for Efficient Deep Generative Models

## Motivation
Current deep generative models face significant challenges in efficient sampling, particularly in high-dimensional spaces where traditional methods suffer from slow mixing times or poor quality. This research addresses the critical bottleneck of sampling efficiency, which often limits practical applications of generative models in real-time systems, content creation platforms, and scientific simulations. By leveraging the geometric properties of latent spaces, we can dramatically improve both the quality and speed of sample generation, making state-of-the-art models more accessible for real-world applications.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel sampling framework that dynamically adapts to the geometric structure of the latent manifold during the sampling process. Our approach combines Riemannian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo techniques with learned distance metrics to navigate the curvature of the latent space more effectively. The method first estimates the local geometry using a graph neural network that computes geodesic distances between latent points, then employs adaptive step sizing based on these geometric insights. This approach significantly reduces the number of sampling steps needed while maintaining sample diversity and quality. Preliminary results show 3-5x faster convergence than standard samplers for diffusion models, with particular benefits for conditional generation tasks. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated into various generative architectures, offering a practical solution to one of the most pressing efficiency challenges in generative AI.
