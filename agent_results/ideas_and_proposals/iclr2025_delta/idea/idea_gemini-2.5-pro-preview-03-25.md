**Title:** Dynamic Latent Geometry Shaping for Robust Generative Models

**Motivation:** Understanding the latent structure learned by Deep Generative Models (DGMs) is key, but analyses often focus only on the final trained state. How the latent space *evolves* during training and how this relates to crucial properties like adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored. Bridging this gap could lead to methods for proactively building more robust DGMs.

**Main Idea:** This research proposes tracking the evolution of latent space geometric properties (e.g., curvature, manifold smoothness, topological features) throughout the training process of DGMs like VAEs and GANs. We will develop metrics to quantify these dynamic geometric changes and correlate them with the final model's adversarial robustness against standard attacks. We hypothesize that specific geometric trajectories during training (e.g., early stabilization of manifold curvature) are predictive of enhanced robustness. The expected outcome is a framework linking latent geometry dynamics to robustness, potentially enabling new regularization techniques that actively guide the geometric evolution during training to yield inherently more robust generative models.
