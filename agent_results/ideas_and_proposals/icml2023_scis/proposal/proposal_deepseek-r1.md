**Adversarial Counterfactual Augmentation for Robustness Against Spurious Correlations**

### 2. Introduction  
**Background**  
Modern machine learning models often exploit spurious correlations—statistical associations between non-causal features and labels—to make predictions. These shortcuts degrade model performance when deployed in real-world settings where such correlations shift or vanish. For instance, medical imaging models may overfit to scanner artifacts rather than disease markers, and NLP models may rely on lexical overlap instead of semantic relationships. Spurious correlations undermine trust in AI systems, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare and precision medicine, where models must generalize across diverse populations and environments.

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal aims to develop **Adversarial Counterfactual Augmentation (ACA)**, a framework that enhances model robustness to spurious correlations *without requiring group annotations*. The objectives are:  
1. **Automated Identification**: Detect spurious features using influence functions and gradient-based attribution.  
2. **Counterfactual Generation**: Train conditional generative models to perturb only spurious features while preserving causal semantics.  
3. **Invariance Training**: Retrain classifiers with a consistency loss to enforce invariance to spurious attributes.  

**Significance**  
Current methods for mitigating spurious correlations often require labeled subgroup data (e.g., group DRO) or lack scalability to complex features (e.g., causal graph-based approaches). ACA addresses these limitations by leveraging generative models to synthesize counterfactuals, enabling robustness in scenarios where group labels are unavailable. By integrating causal principles with adversarial augmentation, ACA bridges gaps between causality, algorithmic fairness, and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization research.

### 3. Methodology  
**Research Design**  

#### 3.1 Data Collection  
Experiments will use benchmark datasets with known spurious correlations:  
- **Vision**: Waterbirds (background bias), CelebA (hair color vs. gender).  
- **NLP**: MultiNLI (lexical overlap bias), CivilComments (demographic biases).  
- **Medical**: NIH Chest X-ray Dataset (hospital-specific artifacts).  

#### 3.2 Spurious Feature Identification  
**Step 1**: Train an ERM (Empirical Risk Minimization) classifier on the original data.  
**Step 2**: Compute influence scores for each training sample $(x_i, y_i)$ using:  
$$
\mathcal{I}(z_i, z_{\text{test}}) = -\nabla_{\theta} L(z_{\text{test}}, \hat{\theta})^\top H_{\hat{\theta}}^{-1} \nabla_{\theta} L(z_i, \hat{\theta}),
$$  
where $H_{\hat{\theta}}$ is the Hessian of the loss. Features with high influence but low causal relevance are flagged as spurious.  
**Step 3**: Validate via gradient-based saliency maps (e.g., Grad-CAM) to localize non-causal regions in images/text.  

#### 3.3 Counterfactual Generation  
A conditional diffusion model $\mathcal{G}$ is trained to modify spurious features while preserving labels. For image data:  
- **Input**: Image $x$, label $y$, and spurious mask $m$ (from Step 2).  
- **Objective**: Generate $x_{\text{cf}} = \mathcal{G}(x, m)$ such that:  
  - $x_{\text{cf}}$ alters *only* regions in $m$ (e.g., background in Waterbirds).  
  - The label $y$ remains unchanged.  

The model is trained with:  
1. **Adversarial Loss**: Ensures realism of $x_{\text{cf}}$.  
2. **Cycle Consistency Loss**: $||\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{G}(x, m), m) - x||_1$ to preserve non-spurious content.  

#### 3.4 Consistency-Driven Training  
Retrain the classifier $f_\theta$ on a mixed dataset of original and counterfactual examples. The loss combines:  
1. **Cross-Entropy Loss**: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}} = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)}[-\log f_\theta(y|x)]$  
2. **Consistency Loss**:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{cons}} = \mathbb{E}_{(x,x_{\text{cf}})}[\text{KL}(f_\theta(x) \ || \ f_\theta(x_{\text{cf}}))].
$$  
The total loss is $\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{cons}}$, where $\lambda$ controls invariance strength.  

#### 3.5 Experimental Validation  
**Baselines**: Compare with ERM, Group DRO, SPUME, EVaLS, and causal methods (e.g., propensity score weighting).  
**Evaluation Metrics**:  
- **Worst-Group Accuracy**: For datasets with subgroup labels (e.g., Waterbirds).  
- **OOD Accuracy**: Test on environments with shifted spurious correlations.  
- **Feature Attribution Metrics**: Use Grad-CAM to quantify reliance on spurious vs. causal features.  
- **Counterfactual Validity**: Human evaluation to verify label consistency and spurious feature edits.  

**Implementation Details**  
- **Models**: ResNet-50 for vision, BERT for NLP.  
- **Generators**: Diffusion models for images, GPT-2 for text counterfactuals.  
- **Training**: Phase 1 (ERM pretraining), Phase 2 (ACA fine-tuning).

### 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Robustness**: ACA-trained models will achieve higher worst-group and OOD accuracy than ERM and annotation-free baselines (e.g., EVaLS).  
2. **Reduced Spurious Reliance**: Saliency maps will show decreased attention to spurious features (e.g., backgrounds in Waterbirds).  
3. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Success in both vision (CelebA) and NLP (MultiNLI) tasks.  

**Impact**  
- **Practical**: ACA reduces reliance on costly group annotations, making robust ML accessible in resource-constrained settings (e.g., healthcare).  
- **Theoretical**: Provides insights into the interplay between counterfactual reasoning, data augmentation, and invariance.  
- **Societal**: Mitigates biases in deployed models, improving fairness and reliability in critical applications.

### 5. Challenges & Mitigations  
1. **Imperfect Counterfactuals**: If $\mathcal{G}$ alters causal features, use cycle consistency loss and human validation.  
2. **Computational Cost**: Optimize diffusion models via latent space techniques (e.g., Stable Diffusion).  
3. **Evaluation in Absence of Labels**: Use proxy metrics like prediction consistency across counterfactuals.

**Conclusion**  
This proposal advances the robustness of machine learning models against spurious correlations through adversarial counterfactual augmentation. By automating the identification and perturbation of spurious features, ACA provides a scalable and annotation-free framework for OOD generalization. Successful implementation will enhance the reliability of AI systems, bridging gaps between causal inference and real-world deployment.
