## Title: Adversarial Counterfactual Augmentation for Spurious Correlation Robustness

## Introduction

### Background

Machine learning models often exhibit poor generalization performance when deployed in real-world scenarios due to their reliance on spurious correlations present in the training data. These spurious correlations are irrelevant or even misleading features that models learn to exploit, leading to suboptimal performance and potential biases. Examples of such spurious correlations include the type of scanner used in medical imaging, lexical overlap in natural language processing tasks, and demographic-specific genetic markers in precision medicine. Existing methods for addressing spurious correlations often require group labels or struggle with complex, unknown spurious features, limiting their practical applicability.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop an *Adversarial Counterfactual Augmentation* (ACA) framework that enhances the robustness of machine learning models against spurious correlations. Specifically, the ACA framework aims to:

1. Identify potentially spurious features in the training data using influence functions or gradient-based attribution methods.
2. Generate "counterfactual" examples by modifying only these identified spurious features while preserving the true labels.
3. Retrain the original task model using both the original data and the generated counterfactuals, incorporating a consistency loss to encourage similar predictions for original-counterfactual pairs.
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of the ACA framework in improving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and stability.

### Significance

The development of the ACA framework addresses a critical gap in the field of machine learning, providing a practical and scalable solution for mitigating the adverse effects of spurious correlations. By improving the robustness of models against spurious correlations, the ACA framework can enhance their generalization performance, reduce biases, and increase trust in real-world applications. Moreover, the framework's ability to operate without explicit group labels makes it particularly valuable for practical deployment in diverse and often unannotated datasets.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The proposed ACA framework will be evaluated on a variety of datasets that exhibit spurious correlations, including:

1. **Medical Imaging**: Chest X-ray datasets where models rely on scanner types or technician marks instead of physiological signals.
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Datasets for entailment reasoning tasks where models rely on the number of shared words rather than the subject-object relationship.
3. **Precision Medicine**: Genomic datasets where models rely on genetic markers prevalent in specific populations.

### Algorithmic Steps

The ACA framework consists of three main steps: spurious feature identification, counterfactual example generation, and model retraining.

#### Step 1: Spurious Feature Identification

Given a model trained on the original data, we first identify potentially spurious features using influence functions or gradient-based attribution methods. These methods quantify the importance of individual features in the model's predictions, allowing us to pinpoint features that are likely to be spurious.

1. **Influence Function**: The influence function measures the change in the model's prediction when a small perturbation is applied to a feature. It is defined as:
   $$
   \text{IF}(x_i) = \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_i}
   $$
   where $f(x)$ is the model's prediction and $x_i$ is the $i$-th feature of the input $x$.

2. **Gradient-based Attribution**: This method uses the gradient of the model's prediction with respect to the input features to identify important features. The gradient is given by:
   $$
   \nabla f(x) = \left(\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_2}, \ldots, \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_n}\right)
   $$
   where $n$ is the number of features in the input $x$.

#### Step 2: Counterfactual Example Generation

Once spurious features are identified, a conditional generative model is trained to create "counterfactual" examples. These examples modify only the identified spurious features while preserving the true labels. For instance, a CycleGAN or diffusion model conditioned on masks/attributes can be used to generate such examples.

1. **CycleGAN**: A CycleGAN is trained to learn the mapping between two domains, where the source domain is the original data and the target domain is the counterfactual data. The mapping function $G$ is defined as:
   $$
   G(x) = \text{generator}(x, y)
   $$
   where $x$ is the input from the source domain and $y$ is the target domain label.

2. **Diffusion Model**: A diffusion model is trained to generate new samples by reversing a gradual noising process. The reverse process can be conditioned on the identified spurious features to generate counterfactual examples.

#### Step 3: Model Retraining

The original task model is retrained using both the original data and the generated counterfactuals. A consistency loss is incorporated to encourage similar predictions for original-counterfactual pairs. The consistency loss is defined as:
$$
\text{Consistency Loss} = \sum_{x, x' \in \mathcal{D}} \text{Loss}(f(x), f(x'))
$$
where $\mathcal{D}$ is the dataset of original-counterfactual pairs, and $f(x)$ is the model's prediction for the input $x$.

### Experimental Design

To validate the effectiveness of the ACA framework, we will conduct experiments on the aforementioned datasets. The experimental design will include:

1. **Baseline Models**: Evaluate the performance of baseline models trained on the original data without any spurious correlation mitigation.
2. **ACA Framework**: Evaluate the performance of models trained using the ACA framework on the original data and generated counterfactuals.
3. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods**: Compare the performance of the ACA framework with existing state-of-the-art methods for spurious correlation robustness.

### Evaluation Metrics

The effectiveness of the ACA framework will be evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Out-of-Distribution Generalization**: Measure the model's performance on unseen data that contains spurious correlations.
2. **Worst-Group Accuracy**: Evaluate the model's performance on the worst-performing group in the dataset.
3. **Consistency Loss**: Measure the consistency between the model's predictions for original and counterfactual examples.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

The ACA framework has the potential to significantly impact the field of machine learning by providing a practical solution for mitigating the adverse effects of spurious correlations. By improving the robustness and generalization performance of models, the framework can enhance trust in real-world applications and contribute to the development of more fair and reliable machine learning systems.
