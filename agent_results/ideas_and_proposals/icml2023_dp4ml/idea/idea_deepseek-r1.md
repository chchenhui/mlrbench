**Title:** Dual Sensitivity Analysis for Deep Model Interpretability via Convex Relaxation  

**Motivation:** Despite advances in model interpretability (e.g., saliency maps), existing methods often lack principled quantification of *how* input perturbations affect predictions under constraints. Lagrange duality, which measures sensitivity to perturbations via dual variables, could address this but is underexplored in nonconvex deep neural networks (DNNs). Bridging this gap could enable robust, mathematically grounded explanations.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a framework to derive sensitivity-based explanations for DNNs by reformulating input-output relationships as constrained optimization problems. To handle nonconvexity, we apply convex relaxation techniques (e.g., semi-definite programming or quadratic approximations) to critical layers, enabling tractable dual variable computation. These dual variables quantify the sensitivity of predictions to bounded input perturbations, revealing feature importance and decision boundaries. For example, in image classification, dual sensitivity could highlight pixels that maximally *and minimally* affect class scores under adversarial constraints. We will validate the approach on vision and NLP models, comparing against gradient-based and attribution methods. Expected outcomes include (1) a duality-driven metric for model interpretability, (2) efficient algorithms for sensitivity computation via relaxed duality, and (3) insights into DNN robustness. This could advance trustworthy AI in domains like healthcare, where understanding prediction stability is critical.
