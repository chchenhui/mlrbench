## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** Lagrange Dual Explainers: Sensitivity-Driven Interpretability for Deep Networks via Constrained Optimization Duality

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and scientific discovery (LeCun et al., 2015). However, their complex, often deeply nested non-linear structure renders them largely "black boxes," hindering trust, deployment in critical applications (e.g., healthcare, autonomous driving), debugging, and scientific insight extraction. Consequently, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged, aiming to develop methods that provide insights into DNN decision-making processes.

Current XAI techniques predominantly fall into categories such as gradient-based methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, Gradient*Input) (Simonyan et al., 2013), perturbation-based methods (e.g., LIME, SHAP) (Ribeiro et al., 2016; Lundberg & Lee, 2017), and methods based on feature attribution propagation (e.g., DeepLIFT, Integrated Gradients) (Shrikumar et al., 2017; Sundararajan et al., 2017). While valuable, these methods often face challenges: gradient-based methods can be noisy or suffer from saturation; perturbation methods can be computationally expensive and sensitive to the perturbation strategy; and many methods lack strong theoretical guarantees regarding the faithfulness or robustness of the explanations they provide (Adebayo et al., 2018; Kindermans et al., 2019). More recent approaches explore sensitivity analysis using metric tools (Pizarroso et al., 2023), topological methods (Spannaus et al., 2023), or physics-informed techniques (Anonymous, 2024; Novello et al., 2022), indicating a growing interest in more structured and theoretically grounded interpretability frameworks.

Duality principles, particularly Lagrange duality from constrained optimization, offer a powerful yet under-explored avenue for DNN interpretability. Duality has a rich history in machine learning, underpinning support vector machines, kernel methods, and optimization algorithms (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004). As noted by the ICML Duality Principles workshop call, Lagrange duality's connection to sensitivity analysis – quantifying how changes in constraints affect an optimal solution – is particularly relevant for understanding feature importance. Applying this principle could allow us to measure the sensitivity of a network's output to input perturbations in a principled manner, potentially overcoming limitations of existing XAI methods. While duality has been applied in specific contexts like conservative solutions for kinetic equations using NNs (Hwang & Son, 2021) or discovering dualities in physics models (Ferrari et al., 2024), its systematic application for generating feature attributions in general deep learning models remains largely untapped, especially given the challenges posed by non-convexity (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004).

**2.2 Research Problem**
The core problem this research addresses is the lack of robust, computationally efficient, and theoretically grounded methods for quantifying the influence of input features on the predictions of deep neural networks. Specifically, we aim to leverage Lagrange duality to develop a novel framework that interprets feature importance as the sensitivity of the network's decision boundary to minimal input perturbations under specific constraints.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop a Formal Framework:** Formulate the problem of finding the minimal input perturbation required to change a DNN's prediction (or significantly alter its confidence for a target class) as a constrained optimization problem. Derive the corresponding Lagrangian dual problem.
2.  **Establish Theoretical Connection:** Theoretically establish the relationship between the optimal Lagrange multipliers (dual variables) of the derived dual problem and the sensitivity of the network's output to perturbations in individual input features or feature groups. Analyze conditions (e.g., local convexity, KKT conditions) under which this relationship holds strongly, even in non-convex DNN landscapes.
3.  **Design an Efficient Algorithm:** Develop a computationally efficient algorithm, likely leveraging automatic differentiation and backpropagation through an augmented network structure representing the Lagrangian, to solve the dual problem (or approximate its solution) and extract the dual variables as feature sensitivity scores.
4.  **Empirical Validation:** Rigorously evaluate the proposed "Lagrange Dual Explainer" (LDE) method on standard benchmark datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet subsets) and diverse DNN architectures (e.g., MLPs, CNNs, potentially Transformers).
5.  **Comparative Analysis:** Compare the LDE method against state-of-the-art XAI techniques based on metrics measuring faithfulness, robustness, computational efficiency, and potentially the tightness of sensitivity bounds.

**2.4 Significance**
This research holds significant potential for advancing the field of Explainable AI and deep learning:

*   **Enhanced Trustworthiness:** By providing explanations grounded in optimization duality and sensitivity analysis, LDE aims to offer more reliable and potentially certifiable insights into model behavior, fostering greater trust in AI systems.
*   **Bridging Theory and Practice:** This work explicitly connects classical optimization duality theory with modern deep learning practice, potentially opening new theoretical avenues for understanding DNNs and providing practical tools for practitioners.
*   **Improved Model Understanding and Debugging:** Robust sensitivity scores can help identify influential features, diagnose model biases, detect spurious correlations, and guide model refinement.
*   **Robustness Insights:** The framework naturally relates to input perturbations, potentially offering insights into model robustness against adversarial attacks or distributional shifts, a key challenge highlighted in the literature (Wang et al., 2024; Pizarroso et al., 2023).
*   **Alignment with Workshop Goals:** This research directly addresses the ICML Duality Principles workshop's call for leveraging duality concepts (specifically Lagrange duality) for model understanding and explanation in deep learning, tackling the noted underutilization of these principles.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Conceptual Framework**
We conceptualize feature importance as the minimum effort required to change a model's decision regarding a specific class. This "effort" is measured by the norm of a perturbation applied to the input, subject to the constraint that the perturbation successfully alters the classification outcome. By formulating this as a constrained optimization problem and examining its Lagrange dual, we hypothesize that the optimal Lagrange multipliers associated with the input features directly quantify their sensitivity or importance in determining the classification boundary.

**3.2 Mathematical Formulation**
Let $f: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^C$ be a deep neural network mapping an input $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ to a vector of logits or probabilities for $C$ classes. Let $y_{target}$ be the index of the target class for explanation. We are interested in explaining the prediction for $x$. Consider the score for the target class $f_{target}(x)$. We seek the smallest perturbation $\delta \in \mathbb{R}^d$ such that the network's prediction changes, or the confidence in the target class drops below a certain threshold $\tau$, or the logit for the target class decreases relative to another class $y_{other}$.

A possible formulation for finding the minimal perturbation to decrease the target class score is:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\delta} \quad & \frac{1}{p} \|\delta\|_p^p \\
\text{subject to} \quad & f_{target}(x+\delta) \le \tau
\end{aligned}
\eqno{(P1)}
$$
where $\|\cdot\|_p$ is the $L_p$-norm (e.g., $p=1, 2$), and $\tau$ is a threshold value, perhaps set relative to the initial score $f_{target}(x)$ or the score of the next highest class. Alternatively, we could aim to make another class $y_{other}$ more likely:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\delta} \quad & \frac{1}{p} \|\delta\|_p^p \\
\text{subject to} \quad & f_{target}(x+\delta) - f_{other}(x+\delta) \le \epsilon
\end{aligned}
\eqno{(P2)}
$$
for some small $\epsilon$ (e.g., $\epsilon=0$ for changing the top prediction). We might also add constraints on $\delta$ itself, such as box constraints ($L_\infty$) or semantic constraints if applicable. For simplicity, let's focus on a generic constraint $h(x+\delta) \le 0$, where $h(\cdot)$ represents the condition for changing the decision (e.g., $h(z) = f_{target}(z) - \tau$ or $h(z) = f_{target}(z) - f_{other}(z) - \epsilon$).

The primal problem is:
$$
\min_{\delta} \quad \frac{1}{p} \|\delta\|_p^p \quad \text{subject to} \quad h(x+\delta) \le 0
$$

**3.3 Lagrangian Formulation and Duality**
We introduce a Lagrange multiplier $\lambda \ge 0$ for the inequality constraint. The Lagrangian function is:
$$ L(\delta, \lambda) = \frac{1}{p} \|\delta\|_p^p + \lambda h(x+\delta) $$
The Lagrange dual function is obtained by minimizing the Lagrangian with respect to the primal variable $\delta$:
$$ g(\lambda) = \inf_{\delta} L(\delta, \lambda) $$
The dual problem is then to maximize the dual function subject to the non-negativity constraint on the multiplier:
$$ \max_{\lambda} \quad g(\lambda) \quad \text{subject to} \quad \lambda \ge 0 $$

Under certain conditions (e.g., convexity, constraint qualifications like Slater's condition), strong duality holds, meaning the optimal value of the primal and dual problems are equal. In the context of DNNs, the function $h(x+\delta)$ involving $f$ is generally non-convex, so strong duality is not guaranteed globally. However, sensitivity analysis via duality remains informative. The optimal dual variable $\lambda^*$ associated with the constraint $h(x+\delta) \le 0$ measures the sensitivity of the optimal primal objective value (minimum perturbation norm) to changes in the constraint boundary. Specifically, $-\lambda^*$ approximates the rate of change of the optimal objective value per unit relaxation of the constraint $h(x+\delta) \le 0$.

While finding the global optimum $\delta^*$ and achieving strong duality is hard due to non-convexity, we can seek stationary points or local optima. Under local convexity assumptions near a solution $\delta^*$, or if KKT conditions are approximately satisfied, $\lambda^*$ still provides a meaningful measure of local sensitivity. Our core idea is to interpret the components of the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to the *original input features* $x$ (or related quantities derived from the optimal dual solution) as feature importance scores. Consider the gradient of the dual function or terms arising from the KKT conditions. For instance, at optimality (or a KKT point) $(\delta^*, \lambda^*)$, we expect $\nabla_\delta L(\delta^*, \lambda^*) = 0$, which gives:
$$ \nabla_\delta \left( \frac{1}{p} \|\delta\|_p^p \right) + \lambda^* \nabla_\delta h(x+\delta^*) = 0 $$
If $p=2$, this simplifies to $\delta^* + \lambda^* \nabla_\delta h(x+\delta^*) = 0$. This links the optimal perturbation $\delta^*$ directly to the gradient of the constraint function weighted by the optimal multiplier $\lambda^*$. The magnitude and direction of components of $\lambda^* \nabla_\delta h(x+\delta^*)$ (which equals $-\delta^*$) indicate how much each feature needs to be perturbed to satisfy the constraint optimally, thus reflecting feature influence. We propose to use a measure derived from this relationship, possibly involving $\lambda^*$ and the gradient $\nabla_x f_{target}(x+\delta^*)$, as the sensitivity score for each feature in $x$.

**3.4 Algorithmic Implementation: Dual Ascent via Backpropagation**
We propose to solve the dual problem (or find a saddle point of the Lagrangian) using gradient-based optimization. The dual function $g(\lambda)$ often cannot be computed in closed form, but we can perform alternating or simultaneous optimization steps on $\delta$ and $\lambda$. A common approach is dual ascent (or gradient ascent on the dual problem).

Let $\delta(\lambda)$ be the minimizer of $L(\delta, \lambda)$ for a fixed $\lambda$. Then $\nabla_\lambda g(\lambda) = h(x+\delta(\lambda))$. The dual ascent update rule is:
$$ \lambda^{(k+1)} = [\lambda^{(k)} + \alpha_k h(x+\delta^{(k)})]_{+} $$
where $\delta^{(k)} = \arg\min_{\delta} L(\delta, \lambda^{(k)})$ and $[\cdot]_{+}$ denotes projection onto non-negative values.

Computing $\delta^{(k)}$ involves minimizing a potentially non-convex function $L(\delta, \lambda^{(k)})$. We can approximate this using gradient descent on $\delta$:
$$ \delta_{j+1} = \delta_j - \beta_j \nabla_\delta L(\delta_j, \lambda^{(k)}) = \delta_j - \beta_j (\nabla_\delta (\frac{1}{p} \|\delta\|_p^p) + \lambda^{(k)} \nabla_\delta h(x+\delta_j)) $$
This inner loop requires computing gradients of the network output $f$ with respect to its input perturbations $\delta$, which is readily achievable via backpropagation.

**Algorithm Outline: Lagrange Dual Explainer (LDE)**

1.  **Initialization:** Choose input $x$, target class $y_{target}$, constraint function $h(\cdot)$. Initialize $\delta^{(0)} = 0$, $\lambda^{(0)} > 0$, step sizes $\alpha, \beta$.
2.  **Iterative Optimization:** For $k = 1, \dots, K$:
    a.  **(Inner Loop - Primal Update):** Find an approximate minimizer $\delta^{(k)}$ for $L(\delta, \lambda^{(k-1)})$. This can be done by taking one or multiple gradient descent steps on $\delta$ starting from $\delta^{(k-1)}$:
        $$ \delta \leftarrow \delta - \beta (\nabla_\delta (\frac{1}{p} \|\delta\|_p^p) + \lambda^{(k-1)} \nabla_\delta h(x+\delta)) $$
        The gradient $\nabla_\delta h(x+\delta)$ involves backpropagation through the network $f$.
    b.  **(Outer Loop - Dual Update):** Update the Lagrange multiplier using gradient ascent on the dual function:
        $$ \lambda^{(k)} = [\lambda^{(k-1)} + \alpha h(x+\delta^{(k)})]_{+} $$
3.  **Termination:** Stop when convergence criteria are met (e.g., small change in $\lambda$, $\delta$, or constraint satisfaction $h(x+\delta^{(k)}) \approx 0$). Let the final solution be $(\delta^*, \lambda^*)$.
4.  **Explanation Extraction:** Compute the feature sensitivity scores. A potential score $S_i$ for feature $x_i$ could be derived from the optimal perturbation and multiplier, for example:
    *   $S_i = | \delta^*_i |$ (magnitude of optimal perturbation for feature $i$)
    *   $S_i = | [\lambda^* \nabla_\delta h(x+\delta^*)]_i |$ (magnitude of the gradient term related to feature $i$)
    *   Other variants involving $\lambda^*$ and gradients w.r.t. the original input $x$. We will investigate the most theoretically sound and empirically effective choice.

This iterative process can be implemented efficiently using standard deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) by constructing a computational graph that includes the Lagrangian objective and performing automatic differentiation. Batch processing can be used to compute explanations for multiple inputs simultaneously.

**3.5 Handling Non-Convexity**
We acknowledge the non-convexity challenge. Our approach focuses on finding locally optimal perturbations near the original input $x$. The derived dual variables $\lambda^*$ will reflect the sensitivity associated with these local solutions. While global optimality isn't guaranteed, local sensitivity is often precisely what is needed for interpretability – understanding how the model behaves *in the vicinity* of a specific input. We will investigate the properties of the solution found, potentially relating it to local geometric properties of the decision boundary.

**3.6 Experimental Design**
*   **Datasets:**
    *   Images: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet (or a subset of ImageNet).
    *   Tabular: UCI datasets (e.g., Adult, COMPAS) where feature importance is critical.
*   **Models:**
    *   MLPs on tabular data.
    *   Standard CNNs: LeNet-5 (MNIST), VGG-16, ResNet-18/50 (CIFAR, ImageNet).
    *   Possibly simplified Vision Transformers (ViT) if computational resources permit.
*   **Baseline XAI Methods:**
    *   Gradient-based: Saliency Maps, Gradient * Input, Integrated Gradients (IG).
    *   Perturbation-based: LIME (using default settings), KernelSHAP (approximated SHAP values).
    *   Others: DeepLIFT.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Faithfulness:**
        *   *Deletion Score:* Rank features by importance score ($S_i$). Progressively remove (zero-out or replace with baseline) top-k features and measure the drop in the target class probability/logit. Higher drop for fewer features indicates better faithfulness.
        *   *Insertion Score:* Start with a baseline input (e.g., blurred image, mean vector). Progressively add top-k features based on the explanation and measure the increase in target class probability. Higher probability increase for fewer features indicates better faithfulness.
        *   *Correlation with Roar Perturbations:* Compare LDE scores with ground-truth importance derived from retraining models with features removed ( computationally expensive, limited scope).
    *   **Robustness:**
        *   *Sensitivity to Input Noise:* Add small random noise or adversarial perturbations to the input $x$ and measure the stability (e.g., using cosine similarity or $L_2$ distance) of the resulting explanation map $S$. Compare stability across methods.
        *   *Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:* Evaluate robustness of LDE scores to choices of $\tau$, $p$, step sizes $\alpha, \beta$, and initialization.
    *   **Computational Efficiency:** Measure the wall-clock time required to generate an explanation for a single instance and for a batch of instances. Compare with baselines.
    *   **Qualitative Analysis:** Visualize explanation heatmaps for image data and compare them visually for coherence and focus on relevant object parts.
*   **Implementation Details:** We will implement the LDE framework using PyTorch. We will carefully tune optimization parameters ($\alpha, \beta, K$) and the constraint definition $h(\cdot)$ based on preliminary experiments.
