### Title: "Attention-Aware Machine Learning: Leveraging Eye Gaze for Enhanced Perception and Interaction"

### Motivation:
Eye gaze data provides a cost-effective and non-invasive means to capture human attentional patterns, offering valuable insights into cognitive processes. Integrating eye gaze data into machine learning models can significantly enhance perception, improve human-AI interactions, and enable better interpretation of human behavior. The proposed research aims to bridge the gap between human cognition and AI by leveraging eye gaze data to develop more accurate and interpretable machine learning models.

### Main Idea:
The main idea is to develop an attention-aware machine learning framework that incorporates eye gaze data to improve the performance and interpretability of machine learning models. The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Collect large-scale eye-tracking data from various domains such as radiology, AR/VR, and autonomous driving. Preprocess the data to extract relevant features, including fixation points, saccades, and scanpaths.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Develop novel feature engineering techniques that can capture the attention patterns from eye gaze data. These features will be used to enhance the representation of input data in machine learning models.

3. **Model Integration**: Integrate the engineered eye gaze features into existing machine learning models, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. This integration will allow the models to better understand and mimic human perception and attention mechanisms.

4. **Evaluation and Validation**: Evaluate the performance of the attention-aware models using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and interpretability. Validate the models in real-world scenarios to assess their practical utility.

5. **Ethical Considerations**: Address the ethical implications of using eye gaze data in AI, focusing on privacy, consent, and the potential misuse of the technology.

The expected outcomes include the development of more accurate and interpretable machine learning models, improved human-AI interactions, and a deeper understanding of human cognition. The potential impact of this research is significant, as it can revolutionize various domains, including healthcare, autonomous systems, and human-computer interaction, by providing AI systems with a better understanding of human attention and perception.
