# Cultural Calibration Framework for Generative AI

## Motivation
Generative AI systems currently reflect predominantly Western cultural values, risking cultural homogenization and marginalizing diverse global perspectives. This imbalance creates relevance and performance gaps for users from non-Western backgrounds, potentially reinforcing existing power dynamics in content creation and cultural representation. As AI becomes increasingly embedded in global creative and communication systems, ensuring these technologies respect and amplify diverse cultural values is not just ethical but essential for their effective and equitable function worldwide.

## Main Idea
The Cultural Calibration Framework proposes a systematic approach to identify, measure, and adjust for cultural biases in generative AI. It combines computational and participatory methods through three interconnected components: (1) Cultural Value Vectors - mathematical representations of distinct cultural dimensions derived from annotated datasets across diverse communities; (2) Differential Testing Protocol - systematic evaluation measuring performance disparities across cultural contexts; and (3) Adaptive Weighting Mechanism - algorithmic approach that dynamically adjusts model outputs based on detected cultural context. The framework would create a continuous feedback loop between model developers and cultural stakeholders, enabling generative AI systems to maintain cultural sensitivity while preserving technical performance. Implementation would initially focus on specific domains (e.g., visual aesthetics, narrative structures) before expanding to broader applications.
