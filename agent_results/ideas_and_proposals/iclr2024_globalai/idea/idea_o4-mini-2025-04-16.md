Title: GlobalCultureScore – A Scalable Framework for Cross-Cultural AI Evaluation

Motivation:  
Current AI evaluation metrics ignore the rich diversity of cultural norms, idioms, and values, leading to models that under-represent or misrepresent non-Western perspectives. We need a scalable, quantitative way to assess how well generative systems respect and reflect multiple cultural contexts.

Main Idea:  
We propose GlobalCultureScore, a three-module pipeline:
1. Cultural Lexicon Extraction: Automatically mine region-specific lexicons (idioms, named entities, sentiment markers) from multilingual corpora curated by cultural experts.  
2. Multi-Dimensional Scoring: For each model output, compute  
   • Representation Coverage – overlap with lexicons  
   • Semantic Alignment – cosine similarity against region-specific embeddings  
   • Cultural Sensitivity – mismatch penalties for stereotypes or taboo topics, learned via a small annotated adversarial dataset  
3. Feedback Loop & Calibration: Deploy in user studies across 10+ countries; crowdsource human ratings to refine scoring weights and thresholds.  

Expected Outcomes:  
A unified GlobalCultureScore that flags under- or mis-representation, guides fine-tuning steps, and serves as an audit metric. This framework empowers developers to benchmark and improve AI inclusivity, reducing cultural bias and boosting global adoption.
