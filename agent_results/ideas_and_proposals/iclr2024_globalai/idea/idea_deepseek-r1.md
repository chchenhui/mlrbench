**Title:** Culturally-Aware Evaluation Framework for Scalable Generative AI Assessment  

**Motivation:** Current AI evaluation pipelines lack systematic methods to measure cultural inclusivity, leading to models that may underperform or misrepresent non-Western contexts. This risks entrenching cultural biases and stifling equitable global deployment. A scalable evaluation framework is critical to systematically benchmark and improve cultural alignment in AI systems.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a modular framework combining automated cultural metrics, human-in-the-loop feedback, and cross-regional test datasets. The framework will:  
1. **Automated Metrics:** Use NLP to detect cultural references, values (e.g., individualism vs. collectivism), and locale-specific semantics in AI outputs.  
2. **Crowdsourced Test Data:** Curate a dataset of culturally diverse prompts and ideal responses via partnerships with regional experts and multilingual annotators.  
3. **Dynamic Evaluation Pipelines:** Integrate adaptive benchmarks that assess performance across cultural dimensions (e.g., festivals, social norms) using stratified sampling for underrepresented regions.  
4. **Feedback Loops:** Deploy fine-tuning protocols based on discrepancies between automated scores and human evaluations from diverse cultural panels.  

Expected outcomes include open-source evaluation tools, a bias-aware benchmarking dataset, and guidelines for culturally granular model iteration. This framework would enable developers to proactively address cultural gaps, fostering AI systems that equitably serve global users.
