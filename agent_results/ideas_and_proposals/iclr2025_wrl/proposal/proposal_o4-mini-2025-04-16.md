Title  
Self-Adaptive Sim-to-Real Transfer Learning for Robust Robot Manipulation Skills  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Recent advances in robot learning have leveraged large-scale simulation and deep reinforcement learning to acquire complex manipulation skills. However, deploying these simulation-trained policies on real hardware remains hindered by the “reality gap”—the mismatch between simulated dynamics and the physical world. Standard remedies, such as heavy domain randomization or extensive manual parameter tuning, trade task performance for a measure of robustness and still often fail when unexpected variations (e.g., hardware wear, unmodeled friction changes, sensor drift) occur. Meanwhile, meta-learning and online system identification methods have shown promise in adapting models or policies from limited real-world data, but existing approaches typically either focus on a single adaptation sub-problem (e.g., dynamics identification) or ignore uncertainty in the adaptation loop, risking unsafe behaviors during exploration.

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a unified, self-adaptive sim-to-real transfer framework that:  
• Continuously refines the robot’s dynamics model online, using real interaction data, without human supervision.  
• Meta-learns policies in simulation that are explicitly optimized for rapid adaptation rather than single-environment performance.  
• Integrates uncertainty estimation into both model adaptation and control, enabling safe, confidence-driven exploration and exploitation.  

Significance  
Achieving truly robust sim-to-real transfer will enable general-purpose robots to tackle a wide range of tasks—from kitchen assistance to industrial manipulation—without laborious per-task tuning. By closing the reality gap on-the-fly, robots will maintain high performance under hardware degradation, environment changes, or novel objects, advancing toward the workshop theme of “Robots with Human-Level Abilities” in unstructured, dynamic settings.  

2. Methodology  

2.1 Framework Overview  
Our framework operates in two phases:  
1. Simulation Pretraining: Collect a rich, task-driven dataset under moderate domain randomization. Using this data, meta-learn both (a) an initial dynamics model ensemble and (b) an initial policy parameterization optimized for fast adaptation.  
2. Online Deployment & Self-Adaptation: On the real robot, alternate between (i) neural system identification updates to the dynamics model ensemble, (ii) meta-adaptation of the policy with only a few gradient steps on newly gathered real data, and (iii) model-predictive control that modulates exploration according to model uncertainty.  

2.2 Neural System Identification Module  
We maintain an ensemble of $M$ neural networks $\{f_{\phi_i}\}_{i=1}^M$ to predict next-state dynamics:  
$$x_{t+1} = f_{\phi_i}(x_t, a_t) + \varepsilon,\quad \varepsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma).$$  
The ensemble captures epistemic uncertainty via predictive variance:  
$$\mathrm{Var}[x_{t+1}\mid x_t,a_t] = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M \bigl(f_{\phi_i}(x_t,a_t)-\bar f(x_t,a_t)\bigr)^2,\quad \bar f=\tfrac1M\sum_i f_{\phi_i}.$$  
Online, after each real-world episode we solve:  
$$\phi_i \leftarrow \phi_i - \beta \nabla_{\phi_i}\,\mathcal{L}_{\rm dyn}^{(i)}\,,\quad  
\mathcal{L}_{\rm dyn}^{(i)}=\|x_{t+1}^{\rm real}-f_{\phi_i}(x_t,a_t)\|^2+\lambda\|\phi_i-\phi_i^{\rm prior}\|^2.$$  
The regularizer anchors the update to the simulation-trained prior $\phi_i^{\rm prior}$.  

2.3 Meta-Learning for Rapid Policy Adaptation  
We employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to optimize policy parameters $\theta$ so that, after a small amount of real data, the adapted policy $\theta'$ achieves high performance. Let each “task” $T_j$ correspond to a specific environment instance (e.g., friction coefficient, payload mass). Define the adaptation step:  
$$\theta_j' = \theta - \alpha\,\nabla_{\theta}\,\mathbb{E}_{\tau\sim\pi_\theta} [\,\mathcal{L}_{T_j}(\tau)\,]\,. $$  
The meta-objective across tasks is:  
$$\min_{\theta}\sum_{j}\mathbb{E}_{\tau'\sim\pi_{\theta_j'}}\bigl[\mathcal{L}_{T_j}(\tau')\bigr]\,. $$  
Here $\mathcal{L}_{T_j}$ is the policy loss (e.g., negative cumulative reward). In simulation we sample tasks via randomization of dynamics and sensor parameters. The result is a policy with initial parameters $\theta$ that require only a few gradient steps on real data to specialize.  

2.4 Uncertainty-Aware Control Strategy  
At deployment, given state $x_t$ and candidate control sequence $\{a_{t:t+H-1}\}$, we optimize a Model-Predictive Control (MPC) cost:  
$$\min_{a_{t:t+H-1}}\;\sum_{k=0}^{H-1}\Bigl[c(x_{t+k},a_{t+k})+\gamma\,\sigma_{\rm dyn}(x_{t+k},a_{t+k})\Bigr],$$  
where $\sigma_{\rm dyn}$ is the predictive standard deviation from the ensemble, and $\gamma>0$ balances performance vs. uncertainty. By penalizing high‐uncertainty actions, the robot avoids risky maneuvers until the model is better adapted. We solve this optimization with either CEM (Cross‐Entropy Method) or differentiable shooting with backpropagation through time.

2.5 Integrated Algorithm  
Algorithm: Self-Adaptive Sim-to-Real Transfer  
1. Pretrain:  
   a. Collect simulated rollouts under domain randomization.  
   b. Meta-train dynamics ensemble $\{\phi_i^{\rm prior}\}$ by minimizing $\mathcal{L}_{\rm dyn}$ on random sim data.  
   c. Meta-learn initial policy parameters $\theta$ via MAML on same sim tasks.  
2. Deployment Loop (for each real episode):  
   a. Execute MPC with current ensemble & policy to collect real trajectory $\tau_{\rm real}$.  
   b. Update dynamics ensemble $\phi_i$ via gradient steps on $\tau_{\rm real}$.  
   c. Adapt policy:  
      $\theta\leftarrow\theta-\alpha\,\nabla_{\theta}\mathcal{L}_{\rm RL}(\tau_{\rm real})$.  
   d. Optionally fine-tune policy model with additional inner loops.  
3. Repeat until convergence or task completion.  

2.6 Experimental Design  
Environments & Tasks:  
• Simulated: PyBullet or MuJoCo with randomized mass, friction, actuator delay.  
• Real: 7-DoF manipulator (e.g., Franka Emika Panda) performing peg-in-hole, drawer opening, block stacking.  

Baselines for Comparison:  
• Zero-shot domain randomization (no online adaptation).  
• Offline system identification + fixed policy.  
• Front-loaded MAML without uncertainty penalty.  

Metrics:  
• Task success rate (percentage of successful trials).  
• Adaptation speed (number of real trials to reach 90% of sim performance).  
• Sample efficiency (real samples per unit increase in reward).  
• Robustness under environment shifts (performance decay vs. magnitude of domain shift).  
• Safety incidents (frequency of unsafe control commands flagged by high uncertainty).  

Procedure:  
1. Initialize each method; run 20 trials per task, per method, measuring metrics above.  
2. Introduce environment perturbations mid-deployment (e.g., add weight to end-effector, change surface friction) and record recovery performance.  
3. Perform statistical analysis (ANOVA, confidence intervals) to validate significance.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

3.1 Expected Outcomes  
We anticipate that our self-adaptive framework will:  
• Achieve ≥90% of simulated performance on real hardware within 5–10 adaptation episodes, outperforming baselines by 30–50% on adaptation speed.  
• Maintain stable control (zero safety violations) even under sudden environment shifts, thanks to uncertainty-aware MPC.  
• Demonstrate data efficiency: requiring <500 real steps to reach robust policy deployment, versus thousands for standard adaptation methods.  
• Scale across multiple manipulation tasks with minimal method re-engineering, confirming generality.  

3.2 Impact  
By coupling continuous neural system identification, meta-adaptation, and uncertainty-aware control, this research will:  
• Push the frontier of sim-to-real transfer, showing that robots can autonomously bridge the reality gap online.  
• Provide a modular framework adoptable by both academic and industrial labs, accelerating development of robust robot skills in areas such as household assistance, industrial automation, and disaster response.  
• Offer theoretical insights into the interplay between meta-learning and uncertainty estimation for safe, adaptive control—informing future work on general embodied AI.  
• Contribute standardized benchmarks (code, task suites, evaluation scripts) to the community, fostering reproducibility and cross-group comparisons in sim-to-real research.
