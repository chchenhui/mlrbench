1. **Title**: LLM-Guided Compositional Program Synthesis (arXiv:2503.15540)
   - **Authors**: Ruhma Khan, Sumit Gulwani, Vu Le, Arjun Radhakrishna, Ashish Tiwari, Gust Verbruggen
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel technique for program synthesis from input-output examples, known as programming by example (PBE). The authors propose a compositional approach where large language models (LLMs) not only guide the decomposition of PBE tasks into simpler subtasks but also solve these subtasks. This method enhances the LLM's ability to handle complex tasks by breaking them down into manageable components, thereby improving problem-solving capabilities.
