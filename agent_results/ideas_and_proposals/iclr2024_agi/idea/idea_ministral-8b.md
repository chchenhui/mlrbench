### Title: Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs through Hierarchical Knowledge Graphs

### Motivation
The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is hindered by their limited reasoning and planning abilities. Current LLMs struggle with complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning, long-term memory, and contextual understanding. This research aims to address these limitations by embedding hierarchical knowledge graphs within LLMs, enhancing their reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.

### Main Idea
The proposed research involves integrating hierarchical knowledge graphs into LLMs to facilitate advanced reasoning and planning. The methodology involves the following steps:
1. **Knowledge Graph Construction:** Develop a comprehensive hierarchical knowledge graph that captures domain-specific knowledge, including entities, relationships, and hierarchical structures.
2. **Graph Embedding:** Utilize graph embedding techniques to convert the knowledge graph into a format that can be integrated with LLM embeddings.
3. **Hybrid Model Architecture:** Design a hybrid model architecture that combines the LLM with the graph embeddings, allowing the model to access and reason with the hierarchical knowledge.
4. **Training and Fine-tuning:** Train the hybrid model using a combination of LLM training data and graph-based reasoning tasks to enhance its reasoning capabilities.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model on a variety of complex reasoning and planning tasks to measure improvements in performance.

Expected outcomes include significant enhancements in the reasoning and planning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to tackle more complex tasks. The potential impact is a substantial step towards AGI by addressing one of the fundamental limitations of current LLMs. This research also paves the way for more advanced AI systems that can understand and reason with complex, real-world data.
