**Title:** Bridging Symbolic Reasoning and Neural Networks for AGI via Hybrid Type I/Type II Architectures  

**Motivation:**  
Large language models (LLMs) excel at pattern recognition (Type I reasoning) but struggle with systematic planning and logical deduction (Type II reasoning), critical for AGI. Historical symbolic AI systems, though rigid, demonstrated structured problem-solving. Integrating these paradigms could address LLMs’ limitations in tasks requiring deliberate reasoning, such as multi-step planning or causal inference, while retaining their adaptability.  

**Main Idea:**  
Propose a hybrid architecture that dynamically combines neural networks (for perceptual learning and contextual understanding) with symbolic reasoning modules (for explicit logic and planning). The framework would use a meta-controller to route tasks between Type I (neural) and Type II (symbolic) pathways, trained via reinforcement learning to optimize reasoning efficiency. For example, a math problem would trigger symbolic modules for equation solving, while contextual nuances are handled by neural components. The system would be evaluated on benchmarks requiring both intuitive and analytical reasoning (e.g., mathematical proofs, strategic games). Expected outcomes include improved generalization, reduced reliance on massive data, and enhanced interpretability. This work could provide a roadmap for overcoming LLMs’ reasoning bottlenecks, advancing AGI by merging the strengths of data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches.  

**Impact:**  
This research could bridge a critical gap in AGI development, enabling systems to fluidly transition between intuitive and analytical thinking, while inspiring new hybrid models that balance scalability with structured reasoning.
