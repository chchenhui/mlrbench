Title: Causally-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Language Models for Robust Reasoning

Motivation:  
Current retrieval-augmented LLMs excel at surface-level pattern matching but falter when required to infer cause-effect, plan under uncertainty, or generalize beyond training correlations. Embedding explicit causal reasoning into such architectures can address these gaps, moving us closer to AGI capable of principled decision-making.

Main Idea:  
We propose a hybrid pipeline that interleaves document retrieval with symbolic causal inference. At query time, the system (1) retrieves contextually relevant text snippets and structured data; (2) constructs a provisional causal graph using a lightweight Bayesian inference module; (3) encodes this graph via a graph neural network into vector embeddings; and (4) conditions the LLM on both raw retrieval and graph embeddings to generate answers or plans. By exposing the model to do-calculus operations and counterfactual queries during fine-tuning, it learns to manipulate and reason over causal structures rather than statistical co-occurrences. We will benchmark on counterfactual QA, dynamic planning in simulated environments, and real-world decision tasks. Expected outcomes include improved generalization under distribution shifts, transparent rationale via causal graphs, and a significant step toward planning-capable AGI.
