### Title: Neuro-Symbolic Architecture for Inductive Tool Synthesis in LLMs

---

### Introduction

#### Background
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) aims to create intelligent systems that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to or beyond human capabilities. Current Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language understanding and generation but fall short in the ability to dynamically adapt and expand their functional capabilities to handle novel situations. The lack of adaptability and the reliance on pre-defined tool APIs limit their problem-solving potential.

#### Research Objectives
The primary objective of this research is to develop a neuro-symbolic framework that enables LLMs to synthesize new tools on-the-fly from basic primitives or existing tools. This approach aims to enhance the adaptability and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs, bringing them closer to achieving AGI. The specific objectives include:

1. **Task Analysis**: Developing a method for LLMs to analyze tasks and identify functional gaps not covered by existing tools.
2. **Tool Specification**: Creating a mechanism for LLMs to propose high-level specifications for needed tools.
3. **Tool Synthesis**: Utilizing a symbolic reasoning engine to synthesize new tools by composing existing tools or atomic functions.
4. **Integration and Verification**: Ensuring seamless integration of synthesized tools into the LLM's toolkit and verifying their correctness and reliability.

#### Significance
This research is significant for several reasons. First, it addresses a critical gap in current LLM capabilities by enabling dynamic tool synthesis. Second, it combines the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning, leveraging the contextual understanding of LLMs and the rigorous synthesis and verification capabilities of symbolic engines. Finally, it contributes to the broader goal of advancing AGI by enhancing the adaptability and problem-solving capabilities of intelligent systems.
