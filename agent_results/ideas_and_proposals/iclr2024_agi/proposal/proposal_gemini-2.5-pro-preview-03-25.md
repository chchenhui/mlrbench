**1. Title:** Enhancing LLM Adaptability through Neuro-Symbolic Inductive Tool Synthesis

**2. Introduction**

*   **Background:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, generation, and various reasoning tasks. Their performance can be significantly augmented by equipping them with external "tools" â€“ specialized APIs, functions, or databases that allow them to interact with the external world, perform precise computations, or access timely information (Schick et al., 2023; Mialon et al., 2023). Systems like ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023) exemplify this paradigm, enabling LLMs to decompose problems and delegate sub-tasks to appropriate tools. However, a fundamental limitation persists: these systems typically rely on a *fixed, pre-defined set of tools*. This restricts their ability to adapt to novel situations or problems that require functionalities unforeseen during the system's design. True Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates a higher degree of adaptability, including the capacity to acquire new skills or create new tools dynamically when faced with unfamiliar challenges.

    Current LLMs excel at pattern recognition and associative reasoning based on their training data, aligning with what some classical AI theories might term Type 1 reasoning (fast, intuitive). However, they often struggle with deliberate, constructive problem-solving and planning that requires novel combinations of existing knowledge or the creation of entirely new operational procedures, akin to Type 2 reasoning (slow, deliberate, analytical) (Kahneman, 2011). The inability to synthesize new tools on-the-fly represents a critical gap in this Type 2 capability, hindering progress towards AGI. If an LLM encounters a problem requiring, for instance, a specific mathematical operation not available as a primitive or a unique way to query a database Ttah5 combines existing API calls in a novel sequence, current tool-augmented systems often fail or resort to brittle, hard-coded solutions within the prompt itself.

    Recent advances in neuro-symbolic AI offer a promising avenue to bridge this gap (Garcez et al., 2023; Wikipedia contributors, 2025). These approaches aim to combine the strengths of connectionist models (LLMs' contextual understanding, pattern recognition) with symbolic methods (logical reasoning, rigorous synthesis, verification). Inspired by work in LLM-guided program synthesis (Khan et al., 2025; Austin et al., 2023), neuro-symbolic frameworks (Cosler et al., 2024; Upreti & Belle, 2025; Liu et al., 2025), and Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) for program synthesis (Muggleton et al., 2023), we propose a neuro-symbolic architecture specifically designed for *inductive tool synthesis*.

*   **Research Idea:** Our core idea is to develop a framework where an LLM, upon encountering a functional gap while solving a task, collaborates with a symbolic reasoning engine to synthesize the required new tool *inductively*. The LLM analyzes the task context, identifies the missing functionality, and generates a high-level specification for the needed tool (e.g., natural language description, input/output examples, type signatures). This specification is passed to a symbolic engine, leveraging techniques like ILP or other program synthesis methods. The symbolic engine attempts to construct the new tool by composing functions from a predefined set of basic primitives (e.g., arithmetic operations, string manipulation, basic API interactions) and potentially leveraging other existing, already-defined tools. The synthesized tool, likely represented as executable code (e.g., Python function) or a logical plan, is then dynamically added to the LLM's available toolkit, allowing immediate use within the ongoing task and potential reuse in future scenarios. This dynamic capability expansion addresses a fundamental limitation of current LLMs, pushing them towards greater autonomy and adaptability, key characteristics often associated with AGI.

*   **Research Objectives:** This research aims to design, implement, and evaluate a novel neuro-symbolic framework for dynamic tool synthesis in LLMs. The specific objectives are:
    1.  **Design the Neuro-Symbolic Architecture:** Define the components (LLM specifier, symbolic synthesizer, tool library manager, execution monitor) and the communication protocols between the neural (LLM) and symbolic parts.
    2.  **Develop LLM Specification Generation:** Investigate methods for the LLM to accurately identify the need for a new tool and generate effective, actionable specifications (potentially combining natural language, input/output examples, and formal constraints) for the symbolic engine.
    3.  **Implement Inductive Symbolic Synthesis:** Adapt and implement symbolic synthesis techniques (e.g., ILP, grammar-based synthesis, constraint-based synthesis) capable of composing primitives and existing tools based on the LLM-generated specifications to produce verifiable and functional tool code.
    4.  **Empirical Evaluation:** Rigorously evaluate the framework's ability to enhance LLM problem-solving capabilities on tasks specifically designed to require novel tool creation. Compare performance against relevant baselines (e.g., LLMs without tools, LLMs with fixed tools, LLMs attempting direct code generation).
    5.  **Analyze Synthesized Tools:** Assess the correctness, efficiency, generalization potential, and interpretability of the dynamically synthesized tools.

*   **Significance:** This research addresses a critical bottleneck in the development of more adaptive and general AI systems. By enabling LLMs to synthesize their own tools, we move beyond static, pre-programmed capabilities towards systems that can dynamically expand their functional repertoire in response to new challenges. This work contributes to:
    *   **Frontiers of AGI Research:** Directly tackles the challenge of adaptability and dynamic capability acquisition in AI agents (aligning with Topic 1 of the workshop).
    *   **Fundamental LLM Limitations:** Addresses limitations in planning, reasoning, and problem-solving when novel functionalities are required (aligning with Topic 4).
    *   **Neuro-Symbolic AI:** Provides a concrete application and testbed for integrating neural perception/understanding with symbolic reasoning/synthesis, advancing this hybrid field (Garcez et al., 2023).
    *   **Practical Applications:** Could lead to more robust and versatile AI assistants, autonomous agents capable of handling unforeseen situations, and powerful tools for scientific discovery or software development that learn to create their own utilities.

**3. Methodology**

This section details the proposed research design, including the system architecture, data requirements, algorithmic steps, experimental validation plan, and evaluation metrics.

*   **System Architecture:**
    We propose a modular neuro-symbolic architecture comprising the following key components:

    1.  **LLM Core:** A powerful foundation model (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-3, Claude 3) acts as the central orchestrator. Its responsibilities include:
        *   Understanding the input task/query.
        *   Attempting to solve the task using existing tools and reasoning steps (e.g., following a ReAct-style loop).
        *   **Tool Gap Identification:** Detecting situations where the current toolset is insufficient. This could be triggered by failed tool calls, inability to formulate a plan, explicit user feedback, or internal confidence scores.
        *   **Specification Generation:** Formulating a request for a new tool. The specification $S$ will likely be a structured format combining:
            *   Natural Language Description ($desc_{NL}$): High-level goal of the tool.
            *   Input/Output Types ($T_{in}, T_{out}$): Defining the expected data types.
            *   Input/Output Examples ($E_{IO} = \{(i_1, o_1), ..., (i_k, o_k)\}$): Concrete examples demonstrating the desired behavior.
            *   Optional Constraints ($C$): Properties the tool must satisfy (e.g., "must use function X", "runtime limit").
            So, $S = (desc_{NL}, T_{in}, T_{out}, E_{IO}, C)$.
    2.  **Symbolic Synthesis Engine:** This module receives the specification $S$ from the LLM Core and attempts to synthesize the tool.
        *   **Synthesis Approach:** We will primarily investigate Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) due to its ability to learn programs from examples and background knowledge (Muggleton et al., 2023). Alternative/complementary approaches like template-based synthesis, sketch-based synthesis (Solar-Lezama, 2008), or type-directed synthesis could also be explored.
        *   **Background Knowledge ($\mathcal{B}$):** This consists of:
            *   A library of **primitive functions ($\mathcal{P}$):** Basic, atomic operations (e.g., arithmetic: `add`, `subtract`; string: `concat`, `slice`; logic: `and`, `not`; simple I/O). These form the building blocks.
            *   The library of **existing synthesized or pre-defined tools ($\mathcal{T}_{existing}$):** Previously validated tools available for composition.
            $\mathcal{B} = \mathcal{P} \cup \mathcal{T}_{existing}$.
        *   **Synthesis Process (ILP Example):** Given $S$, the engine translates $E_{IO}$ into positive examples $E^+$ (and potentially synthesizes negative examples $E^-$ based on $T_{in}, T_{out}, C$). The goal is to find a hypothesis $H$ (the program/tool logic expressed in a suitable language, e.g., Prolog or Python subset) such that:
            $$ \mathcal{B} \wedge H \models E^+ $$
            $$ \mathcal{B} \wedge H \not\models E^- \quad (\text{if } E^- \text{ available}) $$
            The search for $H$ explores combinations of functions in $\mathcal{B}$. Systems like Metaopt (Cropper & Muggleton, 2016) or similar ILP engines will be considered.
        *   **Output:** If successful, the engine returns the synthesized tool $f_{new}$ (e.g., as executable Python code or a callable lambda function) along with confidence scores or verification results (e.g., confirming it passes all examples in $E_{IO}$).
    3.  **Tool Library Manager:** This component maintains the set of available tools $\mathcal{T}_{available}$.
        *   Receives newly synthesized tools $f_{new}$ from the Synthesis Engine.
        *   Validates the tool (e.g., basic static analysis, execution test on $E_{IO}$).
        *   Adds the validated tool to the library: $\mathcal{T}_{available} \leftarrow \mathcal{T}_{available} \cup \{f_{new}\}$.
        *   Indexes the tool (using its name, $desc_{NL}$, type signature) so the LLM Core can discover and select it for future use.
    4.  **Execution Monitor:** Oversees the interaction flow, manages state, handles errors (e.g., synthesis failure, tool execution error), and potentially facilitates feedback loops (e.g., asking the LLM to refine the specification if synthesis fails).

*   **Data Collection and Task Design:**
    Evaluating the system requires tasks where existing tools are insufficient, necessitating synthesis. We will curate a benchmark suite including:
    1.  **Synthetic Mathematical/Logical Tasks:** Problems requiring complex calculations or logical compositions not available as primitives (e.g., "calculate the factorial of the sum of squares of numbers in list X", requiring synthesis of `sum_of_squares` and `factorial` if not primitive).
    2.  **Data Manipulation Tasks:** Scenarios involving structured data (e.g., JSON, CSV) requiring novel transformation or aggregation functions (e.g., "extract all email addresses from field Y, group by domain, and count").
    3.  **Simple API Composition:** Tasks requiring interaction with multiple simple API endpoints in a novel sequence or combination defined by the task, synthesising a macro-function for the specific workflow.
    4.  **Adapted Existing Benchmarks:** Modifying problems from benchmarks like MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), or programming puzzles (e.g., Project Euler, LeetCode) where intermediate computational steps could be framed as tool synthesis problems. The environment will provide the primitive functions and potentially some initial tools.

*   **Algorithmic Steps:**
    The overall workflow for processing a task $T$ will be:
    1.  LLM Core receives task $T$.
    2.  LLM Core attempts to solve $T$ using $\mathcal{T}_{available}$ (planning and executing steps).
    3.  **If** a required functionality $F$ is missing:
        a.  LLM Core identifies the gap and generates specification $S_F$.
        b.  Send $S_F$ to Symbolic Synthesis Engine.
        c.  Symbolic Synthesis Engine attempts to synthesize $f_{new}$ using $\mathcal{B}$.
        d.  **If** synthesis succeeds:
            i.  Receive $f_{new}$.
            ii. Send $f_{new}$ to Tool Library Manager for validation and addition to $\mathcal{T}_{available}$.
            iii. LLM Core retries the relevant step using the newly available $f_{new}$.
        e.  **Else** (synthesis fails): Handle error (e.g., inform LLM, request refined specification, attempt alternative solution path, report failure).
    4.  **Else** (no tool gap identified or task solved): Continue execution or return final result.

*   **Experimental Design:**
    We will conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed neuro-symbolic framework (let's call it NeuroSynthTool).
    *   **Baselines:**
        1.  **LLM-ZeroTool:** The base LLM without any tools, attempting to solve tasks via direct generation/reasoning.
        2.  **LLM-FixedTool:** The base LLM equipped with the initial set of primitives $\mathcal{P}$ and potentially some common, pre-defined tools relevant to the benchmark, but *without* the ability to synthesize new ones. Uses a standard tool-use prompting method (e.g., ReAct).
        3.  **LLM-CodeGen:** The base LLM attempting to directly generate the necessary code for the missing functionality *within its reasoning trace*, without a separate symbolic synthesis step or structured tool management.
    *   **Evaluation Tasks:** The custom benchmark suite described above, categorized by difficulty and type of required synthesis (e.g., arithmetic, data manipulation, API composition).
    *   **Procedure:** Each system (NeuroSynthTool and baselines) will be run on each task in the benchmark suite multiple times (to account for stochasticity). Performance will be measured using the metrics below.
    *   **Ablation Studies:** To understand the contribution of different components:
        *   *Varying Specification Quality:* Provide incomplete or noisy specifications to the synthesis engine to test robustness.
        *   *Varying Synthesis Engine:* Compare ILP vs. other synthesis methods (e.g., template-based).
        *   *Varying Primitives:* Test performance with richer vs. minimal primitive sets $\mathcal{P}$.
        *   *Disabling Composition:* Allow synthesis only from $\mathcal{P}$, not $\mathcal{T}_{existing}$, to assess the value of composing existing tools.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Task Success Rate:** Percentage of tasks successfully completed (primary metric). A task is successful if the final output matches the ground truth.
    2.  **Tool Synthesis Success Rate:** Percentage of synthesis requests that resulted in a successfully synthesized tool.
    3.  **Synthesized Tool Correctness:** Percentage of *successfully synthesized* tools that pass a held-out set of test cases (beyond $E_{IO}$ used for synthesis).
    4.  **Efficiency Metrics:**
        *   Wall-clock time per task.
        *   Number of LLM calls per task.
        *   Number of calls to the symbolic synthesis engine per task.
        *   Average synthesis time per tool.
    5.  **Adaptability Score:** Performance on a sequence of tasks where later tasks require tools synthesized in earlier ones, measuring the system's ability to build upon its capabilities.
    6.  **Interpretability:** Qualitative assessment of the synthesized tool code (e.g., complexity, readability, logical structure). Use code complexity metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity) if tools are generated as code.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

*   **Expected Outcomes:**
    1.  **A Functional Prototype:** A working implementation of the NeuroSynthTool framework, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-guided inductive tool synthesis.
    2.  **Empirical Validation:** Quantitative results showing the conditions under which NeuroSynthTool outperforms baseline methods on tasks requiring dynamic capability expansion. We expect significantly higher task success rates for NeuroSynthTool on our benchmark compared to baselines.
    3.  **Architectural Insights:** Understanding of effective communication strategies and specification formats between LLMs and symbolic synthesizers. Identification of challenges in this integration (e.g., ambiguity transfer from LLM to spec).
    4.  **Synthesis Technique Analysis:** Comparative analysis of different symbolic synthesis algorithms (e.g., ILP vs. others) in terms of success rate, efficiency, and the complexity of tools they can generate within this framework.
    5.  **Characterization of Synthesized Tools:** Analysis of the types, correctness, and complexity of tools the system can reliably generate, and the limitations thereof.
    6.  **Publications and Dissemination:** Peer-reviewed publications in leading AI/ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, IJCAI) or workshops (specifically, the "How Far Are We From AGI" workshop). Potential for open-sourcing the framework and benchmark dataset to encourage further research.

*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Advancing AI Capabilities:** This research directly addresses the critical limitation of static capabilities in current AI systems. By enabling dynamic tool synthesis, we take a significant step towards more adaptable, general-purpose AI agents that can learn new skills autonomously, a key requirement for AGI.
    *   **Bridging Neural and Symbolic AI:** The project serves as a concrete test case for the neuro-symbolic paradigm, demonstrating how the perceptual and contextual strengths of LLMs can be fruitfully combined with the rigorous, verifiable nature of symbolic methods for complex problem-solving and capability generation.
    *   **Enhancing LLM Reliability and Reasoning:** The symbolic synthesis and verification step can potentially lead to more reliable and verifiable functional extensions for LLMs compared to relying solely on the LLM to generate and execute code directly, addressing concerns about hallucination and incorrect reasoning in critical computations.
    *   **New Application Paradigms:** Success could unlock new applications where AI needs to adapt to unique, unforeseen requirements in real-time, such as personalized cognitive assistants that craft tools for a user's specific workflow, scientific research agents that devise custom analysis functions, or robust robotic agents operating in unpredictable environments.
    *   **Informing AGI Discussion:** By demonstrating a concrete mechanism for dynamic capability acquisition, this work will provide valuable data points and insights for the broader discussion on the path towards AGI, highlighting both the potential of current approaches and the remaining challenges (e.g., scalability of synthesis, handling highly complex specifications, safety of synthesized tools â€“ linking to Topics 5 & 6 of the workshop).

This research promises to push the boundaries of LLM capabilities, offering a novel approach to enhance their adaptability and problem-solving prowess through the principled integration of neural understanding and symbolic synthesis, contributing directly to the exploration of pathways toward Artificial General Intelligence.
