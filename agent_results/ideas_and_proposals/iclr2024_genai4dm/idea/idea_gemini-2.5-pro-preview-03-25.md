**Title:** Diffusion World Models for Physics-Aware Planning

**Motivation:** Accurate world models are crucial for sample-efficient planning and model-based reinforcement learning, especially in robotics where physical interactions are complex. Standard predictive models often fail to capture realistic long-term dynamics. Diffusion models, known for high-fidelity generation, offer a promising alternative.

**Main Idea:** This research proposes developing action-conditioned diffusion models as physics-aware world models. The model will be trained on sequences of observations (e.g., images) and actions from an environment. Unlike standard video prediction, the diffusion process will be structured to implicitly learn and respect underlying physical constraints (e.g., object permanence, collision dynamics) by conditioning on state-action histories. The trained diffusion model can then generate physically plausible future state trajectories conditioned on planned action sequences. These rollouts will be integrated into planning algorithms (like Model Predictive Control) or model-based RL frameworks to improve decision-making quality and sample efficiency in tasks requiring complex physical reasoning, evaluated on robotics simulation benchmarks.
