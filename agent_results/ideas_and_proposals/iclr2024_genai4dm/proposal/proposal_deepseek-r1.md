### 2. **Introduction**  

#### **Background**  
Sparse-reward decision-making tasks, such as robotic manipulation or long-horizon planning, pose significant challenges for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Traditional exploration strategies like $\epsilon$-greedy or entropy regularization often fail in these settings due to high-dimensional state spaces and delayed feedback, leading to prohibitive sample complexity. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly diffusion models (DMs), offer transformative potential for addressing these challenges. DMs excel at capturing complex data distributions and generating high-quality sequential data (e.g., trajectories), raising the question: *Can pre-trained diffusion models guide exploration by encoding structural priors from related domains, thereby improving sample efficiency?*  

#### **Research Objectives**  
1. Develop a **diffusion-guided exploration framework** that leverages pre-trained DMs to generate plausible and diverse state sequences for exploration in sparse-reward tasks.  
2. Design an **intrinsic reward mechanism** based on alignment with diffusion-generated trajectories to prioritize novel yet feasible state visits.  
3. Evaluate the framework’s ability to reduce sample complexity while maintaining task performance across procedurally generated and robotic control environments.  

#### **Significance**  
This work bridges two critical gaps:  
- **Methodological**: Combines the generative capabilities of DMs with RL exploration, enabling agents to learn from **unlabeled environmental dynamics** rather than relying solely on sparse rewards.  
- **Practical**: Provides a framework for deploying RL in real-world applications (e.g., robotics, autonomous systems) where labeled reward data is scarce.

### 3. **Methodology**  

#### **Research Design**  
The proposed method comprises three phases: **(1)** pre-training a DM on state trajectories from related domains, **(2)** integrating the DM into an RL loop for guided exploration, and **(3)** evaluating performance against baselines in sparse-reward settings.  

##### **Phase 1: Diffusion Model Pre-Training**  
- **Data Collection**: Gather state trajectories $\\{\tau_i\\}_{i=1}^N$ from *related* tasks (e.g., robotic manipulation demos, game playthroughs) where $\tau_i = (s_0, s_1, \dots, s_T)$.  
- **Model Architecture**: Use a **video diffusion model** with a U-Net backbone to capture temporal dependencies.  
- **Training Objective**: Minimize the diffusion loss over noisy trajectory denoising:  
  $$  
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{diff}} = \mathbb{E}_{t, \tau, \epsilon}\left[\|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\tau_t, t)\|^2\right],  
  $$  
  where $\tau_t$ is a noisy trajectory at diffusion step $t$, and $\epsilon_\theta$ is the denoising network.  

##### **Phase 2: RL with Diffusion-Guided Exploration**  
- **Agent Setup**: A policy $\pi_\phi(a|s)$ is trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with an augmented reward:  
  $$  
  r_{\text{total}} = r_{\text{ext}} + \lambda r_{\text{int}},  
  $$  
  where $r_{\text{ext}}$ is the sparse environment reward, and $r_{\text{int}}$ is an intrinsic reward from the DM.  
- **Intrinsic Reward Design**:  
  1. **Trajectory Generation**: At each episode, sample $K$ synthetic trajectories $\\{\hat{\tau}_k\\}_{k=1}^K$ from the DM conditioned on the agent’s current state $s_t$.  
  2. **Novelty Scoring**: Compute the alignment between the agent’s observed trajectory $\tau_{\text{agent}}$ and generated trajectories using a distance metric $d(\tau_{\text{agent}}, \hat{\tau}_k)$.  
  3. **Reward Calculation**:  
    $$  
    r_{\text{int}} = \max_k \left[\frac{1}{1 + d(\tau_{\text{agent}}, \hat{\tau}_k)}\right] \quad \text{(inversely proportional to similarity)}.  
    $$  
  This incentivizes the agent to explore regions of the state space aligned with DM-generated plausible sequences.  

- **Algorithm**:  
  ```  
  1. Pre-train DM on offline trajectories.  
  2. Initialize RL policy $\pi_\phi$.  
  3. For each episode:  
     a. Generate $K$ trajectories $\\{\hat{\tau}_k\\}$ from DM.  
     b. Roll out $\pi_\phi$, compute $r_{\text{int}}$ using $\{\hat{\tau}_k\}$.  
     c. Update $\pi_\phi$ via PPO using $r_{\text{total}}$.  
  ```  

##### **Phase 3: Experimental Validation**  
- **Environments**:  
  - **Robotics**: MetaWorld’s sparse-reward manipulation tasks (e.g., "pick-and-place").  
  - **Procedural Generation**: MiniGrid environments with randomized layouts and sparse rewards.  
- **Baselines**: Compare against:  
  1. **PPO** (vanilla).  
  2. **Random Network Distillation** (RND).  
  3. **CURL** (contrastive unsupervised RL).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  1. **Sample Efficiency**: Episodes/transitions required to reach 80% success rate.  
  2. **Success Rate**: Percentage of episodes where the task is completed.  
  3. **Trajectory Diversity**: Mean pairwise distance between agent trajectories.  

#### **Ablation Studies**  
1. **DM Conditioning Ablations**: Test conditioning on partial vs. full trajectories.  
2. **Intrinsic Reward Ablations**: Remove $r_{\text{int}}$ or replace DM with a VAE.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

#### **Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Sample Efficiency**: The proposed method will achieve higher success rates with fewer training episodes compared to baseline methods in sparse-reward tasks.  
2. **Enhanced Exploration**: Agents will explore more diverse and feasible trajectories, as measured by trajectory diversity metrics.  
3. **Generalization**: The DM will enable agents to adapt to procedurally generated environments more effectively than reward-only methods.  

#### **Impact**  
- **Generative AI for RL**: Advances the integration of DMs into RL pipelines, demonstrating their utility beyond data generation.  
- **Real-World Applications**: Enables efficient training of robots in settings where reward engineering is impractical (e.g., household tasks, disaster response).  
- **Theoretical Insights**: Provides empirical evidence for the role of generative priors in mitigating exploration challenges.

### 5. **Conclusion**  
This proposal addresses a critical challenge in RL—inefficient exploration in sparse-reward settings—by leveraging diffusion models to inject structural priors into the exploration process. By combining guided trajectory generation with intrinsic reward design, the framework promises significant improvements in sample efficiency and task performance. Successful implementation will establish a new paradigm for incorporating generative models into decision-making systems, with broad implications for AI research and real-world deployment.
