# Diffusion-Guided Exploration for Sparse Reward Tasks

## Introduction

Sparse reward settings present significant challenges for decision-making agents, often requiring extensive trial-and-error exploration to discover successful behaviors. Traditional exploration strategies struggle with high-dimensional state spaces and long-horizon tasks where rewards are scarce. Pre-trained diffusion models, which have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in capturing complex data distributions, offer promising potential as exploration guides - they understand structural patterns in environments without requiring reward signals. This research addresses the critical need for more efficient exploration mechanisms in decision-making for complex, sparse-reward scenarios.

The proposed research aims to leverage pre-trained diffusion models to generate novelty-seeking exploratory behaviors in sparse reward environments. The approach consists of a dual-phase exploration system: (1) A diffusion model pre-trained on state trajectories from related domains learns the manifold of plausible state sequences, and (2) During training, the model guides exploration by generating "imagined" novel state sequences that are both diverse and physically plausible. The agent then receives intrinsic rewards for reaching states that align with these generated sequences. This approach effectively trades labeled reward data for unlabeled environmental data, allowing the diffusion model to identify promising regions of the state space without explicit reward signals. The method would be evaluated on complex robotic manipulation tasks and procedurally generated environments where traditional exploration techniques fail due to sparse feedback. This approach could dramatically reduce the sample complexity of learning in open-ended environments by introducing structural priors from visual dynamics models.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed methodology involves the integration of pre-trained diffusion models with reinforcement learning agents to enhance exploration in sparse reward environments. The key steps include:

1. **Pre-training the Diffusion Model**: A diffusion model is pre-trained on state trajectories from related domains to learn the manifold of plausible state sequences. This step leverages existing datasets to capture the underlying dynamics of the environment.

2. **Exploration Guided by Diffusion Model**: During training, the diffusion model generates "imagined" novel state sequences that are both diverse and physically plausible. The agent receives intrinsic rewards for reaching states that align with these generated sequences.

3. **Reinforcement Learning with Intrinsic Rewards**: The agent learns to maximize the sum of the intrinsic rewards and the sparse external rewards, using a reinforcement learning algorithm such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Pre-training the Diffusion Model**:
   - Input: State trajectories from related domains.
   - Output: Pre-trained diffusion model that captures the manifold of plausible state sequences.
   - Process:
     - Train the diffusion model using the state trajectories.
     - Optimize the model parameters using a suitable loss function, such as the denoising loss.

2. **Generating Novel State Sequences**:
   - Input: Pre-trained diffusion model.
   - Output: Novel state sequences.
   - Process:
     - Sample noise vectors from a standard normal distribution.
     - Use the diffusion model to generate state sequences from the noise vectors.
     - Apply a denoising process to generate diverse and physically plausible state sequences.

3. **Exploration with Intrinsic Rewards**:
   - Input: Novel state sequences.
   - Output: Intrinsic rewards.
   - Process:
     - For each generated state sequence, compute the intrinsic reward based on the alignment with the generated states.
     - Use the intrinsic rewards to guide the agent's exploration.

4. **Reinforcement Learning with PPO**:
   - Input: Intrinsic rewards, sparse external rewards.
   - Output: Optimal policy.
   - Process:
     - Train the agent using PPO, maximizing the sum of intrinsic rewards and sparse external rewards.
     - Update the policy parameters iteratively using the PPO algorithm.

### Mathematical Formulations

#### Diffusion Model Training

The diffusion model is trained to predict the state sequence at a given time step \( t \) from the state sequence at time step \( t-1 \). The objective is to minimize the denoising loss:

\[ \mathcal{L}_{\text{denoising}} = \mathbb{E}_{t, \epsilon, x_0} \left[ \|\epsilon - \epsilon_{\theta}(x_t, t, \epsilon) \|^2 \right] \]

where \( \epsilon \) is the noise vector, \( x_0 \) is the initial state, \( \epsilon_{\theta} \) is the denoising network parameterized by \( \theta \), and \( t \) is the time step.

#### Intrinsic Reward Calculation

The intrinsic reward is computed based on the alignment of the generated state sequence with the actual state sequence. The reward function can be formulated as:

\[ R_{\text{intrinsic}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \exp \left( -\alpha \| x_i - x_i' \|^2 \right) \]

where \( x_i \) is the generated state, \( x_i' \) is the actual state, \( N \) is the number of states in the sequence, and \( \alpha \) is a hyperparameter controlling the reward sensitivity.

### Experimental Design

The proposed method will be evaluated on complex robotic manipulation tasks and procedurally generated environments. The evaluation metrics include:

1. **Sample Efficiency**: Measure the number of interactions required to achieve a certain performance level.
2. **Exploration Coverage**: Evaluate the diversity of the states explored by the agent.
3. **Reward Acquisition**: Track the cumulative reward obtained by the agent.

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Sample Efficiency**: The number of episodes or interactions required to reach a specific performance threshold.
2. **Exploration Coverage**: The diversity of the states explored, measured by the entropy of the state distribution.
3. **Reward Acquisition**: The cumulative reward obtained by the agent over a set of episodes.

### Validation

To validate the method, we will compare the performance of the diffusion-guided exploration approach with baseline methods such as random exploration and model-based exploration. The experiments will be conducted in various environments with different levels of complexity and reward sparsity.
