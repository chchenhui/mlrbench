# Diffusion-Guided Exploration for Sparse Reward Tasks

## Motivation
Sparse reward settings present significant challenges for decision-making agents, often requiring extensive trial-and-error exploration to discover successful behaviors. Traditional exploration strategies struggle with high-dimensional state spaces and long-horizon tasks where rewards are scarce. Pre-trained diffusion models, which have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in capturing complex data distributions, offer promising potential as exploration guides - they understand structural patterns in environments without requiring reward signals. This research addresses the critical need for more efficient exploration mechanisms in decision-making for complex, sparse-reward scenarios.

## Main Idea
I propose leveraging pre-trained diffusion models to generate novelty-seeking exploratory behaviors in sparse reward environments. The approach consists of a dual-phase exploration system: (1) A diffusion model pre-trained on state trajectories from related domains learns the manifold of plausible state sequences, and (2) During training, the model guides exploration by generating "imagined" novel state sequences that are both diverse and physically plausible. The agent then receives intrinsic rewards for reaching states that align with these generated sequences. This approach effectively trades labeled reward data for unlabeled environmental data, allowing the diffusion model to identify promising regions of the state space without explicit reward signals. The method would be evaluated on complex robotic manipulation tasks and procedurally generated environments where traditional exploration techniques fail due to sparse feedback. This approach could dramatically reduce the sample complexity of learning in open-ended environments by introducing structural priors from visual dynamics models.
