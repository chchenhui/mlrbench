**Title:** Dynamic Adaptation of Foundation Models via Meta-Learned Routing for In-the-Wild Deployment  

**Motivation:** Foundation models (FMs) face a critical challenge in balancing adaptation efficacy (via RAG, ICL, or FT) with computational efficiency during real-world deployment. Current methods often apply these techniques statically, leading to suboptimal resource use and latency, especially in domains like healthcare or education where both accuracy and responsiveness are vital.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a meta-learning framework that dynamically routes inputs to the most suitable adaptation strategy (RAG, ICL, or FT) based on task requirements and resource constraints. A lightweight router model, trained via reinforcement learning, evaluates input complexity, domain specificity, and available computational budgets to select the optimal pathway. For instance, simple queries trigger ICL for low-latency responses, while novel domain tasks activate RAG-enhanced FT for accuracy. The framework will be validated on multi-domain benchmarks (e.g., clinical QA, personalized tutoring), measuring adaptation speed, accuracy, and resource consumption. Expected outcomes include a 20-40% reduction in inference time and improved out-of-distribution robustness, enabling scalable, cost-effective FM deployment in resource-constrained settings.
