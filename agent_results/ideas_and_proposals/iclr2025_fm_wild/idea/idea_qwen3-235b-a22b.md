1. **Title**: Self-Correcting Reasoning Chains: Enhancing Foundation Models with Dynamic Knowledge Verification for Robust In-the-Wild Applications  

2. **Motivation**: Foundation models (FMs) often generate fluent but flawed reasoning chains, leading to compounding errors in multi-step tasks like medical diagnosis or code generation. This undermines reliability in critical domains where incorrect conclusions can have severe consequences. Current approaches lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps dynamically, limiting their real-world applicability.  

3. **Main Idea**: Propose a framework that augments FMs with a dynamic verification module to iteratively validate and refine reasoning chains. During multi-step inference, each generated reasoning step is cross-checked against external knowledge sources (e.g., databases, symbolic logic, or domain-specific ontologies) via retrieval-augmented verification. If inconsistencies are detected, the model revises the step using retrieved evidence before proceeding. Methodology includes: (1) a step-wise verification component that flags potential errors, and (2) a feedback loop enabling iterative correction. Expected outcomes include improved accuracy on tasks requiring multi-hop reasoning (e.g., 15â€“20% gains on datasets like HotpotQA or MathQA) and reduced hallucination rates. This approach bridges the gap between black-box reasoning and trustworthy deployment, enabling safer FM integration into high-stakes applications like clinical decision-making or autonomous systems.
