**Title:** Cross-Modal World Models: Unified Latent Space for Multimodal Simulation and Prediction  

**Motivation:** Intelligent agents must integrate diverse sensory inputs (e.g., vision, language, control signals) to interact effectively with complex environments. Existing world models often focus on single modalities, limiting their ability to simulate realistic scenarios or generalize across domains. A unified framework that harmonizes multimodal data is crucial for applications like embodied AI and healthcare, where decision-making relies on coherent interpretations of heterogeneous inputs.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a transformer-based architecture with modality-specific encoders that project inputs into a shared latent space, trained using contrastive learning and cross-modal attention. The model will predict environment dynamics by fusing visual, textual, and control signals, enabling joint simulation (e.g., generating video from text instructions) and inference (e.g., extracting causal relationships from multimodal data). Training involves a novel masked reconstruction objective, where the model predicts missing modalities (e.g., inferring robot actions from visual-text context). Benchmarks will include multimodal datasets (e.g., paired video-text trajectories in robotics). Expected outcomes: Improved cross-modal consistency in simulations and robustness in real-world applications like assistive healthcare (e.g., predicting patient outcomes from joint clinical notes and sensor data). Potential impact: Scalable, generalizable world models for complex, interactive environments.
