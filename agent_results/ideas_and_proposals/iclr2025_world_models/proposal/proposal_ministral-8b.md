# Causality-Aware World Models via Counterfactual Latent State Prediction

## 1. Introduction

### Background
World models are a fundamental concept in artificial intelligence, focusing on how intelligent agents can understand and model the external interactive worlds/environments to improve their decision-making and planning abilities. Initially, world models were centered around low-level physical quantities and interactions using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Over time, the scope expanded to real-world simulation and the generation of complex, high-dimensional environments. This evolution highlights the growing complexity and capabilities of world models, making them pivotal for various applications, including embodied AI, healthcare, and natural sciences.

### Research Objectives
The primary objective of this research is to develop a causality-aware world model that can not only predict future observations based on correlations but also understand and model causal relationships. This involves training the model to predict counterfactual latent states resulting from hypothetical interventions. The proposed method aims to enhance the robustness, generalizability, and interpretability of world models, making them more suitable for complex domains like robotics and healthcare.

### Significance
The ability to predict outcomes under hypothetical interventions is crucial for robust decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing world models often lack genuine causal understanding, limiting their ability to generalize to novel situations or anticipate the results of specific interventions. By incorporating counterfactual reasoning, the proposed approach aims to address these limitations, leading to more accurate, interpretable, and generalizable world models.

## 2. Methodology

### Research Design

#### 2.1. Data Collection
The proposed methodology will leverage synthetic and real-world datasets that simulate various physical and social environments. These datasets will include time-series data of states and observations, along with corresponding interventions or hypothetical scenarios. The data will be preprocessed to ensure consistency and quality, and it will be split into training, validation, and test sets.

#### 2.2. Model Architecture
The proposed model will combine Transformer and state-space model (SSM) architectures to capture temporal dynamics and causal relationships. The Transformer component will handle long-range dependencies and sequential data, while the SSM component will model the latent state space and its evolution over time. The model will be designed to predict both observed and latent states, with the ability to incorporate interventions to predict counterfactual outcomes.

#### 2.3. Training Procedure
The training procedure will involve two main components:

1. **Autoregressive Prediction**: The model will be trained to predict future states based on past observations, similar to standard world model training. This will involve minimizing the difference between predicted and actual future states using a suitable loss function, such as mean squared error (MSE).

2. **Counterfactual Prediction**: In addition to standard training, the model will receive perturbed actions or states representing hypothetical interventions. The model will be trained to predict the resulting deviation from the original predicted trajectory, encouraging the latent space to encode causal relationships. This will involve minimizing the difference between predicted counterfactual outcomes and actual outcomes under the corresponding interventions.

#### 2.4. Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance will be evaluated using a combination of metrics to assess its ability to predict future states, generalize to unseen interventions, and capture causal relationships. The evaluation metrics will include:

1. **Future State Prediction Accuracy**: Measured using MSE or mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual future states.

2. **Generalization to Unseen Interventions**: Evaluated using the accuracy of counterfactual predictions in novel scenarios not encountered during training.

3. **Causal Representation**: Assessed using causal discovery algorithms to identify and validate the causal structures learned by the model.

4. **Interpretability**: Measured using metrics such as the accuracy of counterfactual explanations generated by the model.

### Mathematical Formulation

The proposed model can be mathematically formulated as follows:

1. **Autoregressive Prediction**: Given a sequence of observations \( \mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_T \), the model predicts the next observation \( \mathbf{x}_{T+1} \) using the latent state \( \mathbf{s}_T \):

   \[
   \mathbf{x}_{T+1} = f(\mathbf{s}_T)
   \]

   where \( f \) is a function parameterized by the model.

2. **Counterfactual Prediction**: Given an intervention \( \mathbf{i} \) at time \( T \), the model predicts the resulting deviation \( \Delta \mathbf{s}_{T+1} \) from the original predicted trajectory:

   \[
   \Delta \mathbf{s}_{T+1} = g(\mathbf{s}_T, \mathbf{i})
   \]

   where \( g \) is another function parameterized by the model.

### Experimental Design

The proposed method will be evaluated using a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The experiments will involve:

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Comparing the performance of the proposed causality-aware world model with existing world models that do not incorporate counterfactual reasoning.

2. **Generalization Evaluation**: Assessing the model's ability to generalize to unseen interventions using a holdout set of novel scenarios.

3. **Causal Discovery**: Validating the causal structures learned by the model using causal discovery algorithms.

4. **Interpretability Analysis**: Evaluating the interpretability of the model's counterfactual explanations.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Improved Future State Prediction**: The proposed causality-aware world model is expected to achieve higher accuracy in predicting future states compared to existing world models.

2. **Enhanced Generalization**: The model should demonstrate superior generalization to unseen interventions, making it more robust and adaptable to novel situations.

3. **Explicit Causal Representations**: The model is expected to learn explicit causal structures, enabling more interpretable and explainable predictions.

4. **Robust Decision-Making**: The incorporation of counterfactual reasoning will enhance the model's ability to support robust decision-making processes in complex domains like robotics and healthcare.

### Impact

1. **Advancements in World Models**: The proposed research will contribute to the advancement of world models by incorporating counterfactual reasoning, leading to more accurate, generalizable, and interpretable models.

2. **Applications in Complex Domains**: The improved world models will have significant implications for various applications, including embodied AI, healthcare, and natural sciences, where understanding causal relationships is crucial for effective decision-making.

3. **Interdisciplinary Research**: The proposed method will foster interdisciplinary research, bringing together insights from machine learning, causal inference, and domain-specific applications.

4. **Practical Implications**: The development of causality-aware world models will have practical implications, enabling more reliable and adaptive AI systems in real-world scenarios.
