1. **Title**: Deployment-Ready Computational Sustainability: A Robustness Benchmark and Framework for Real-World Environmental Challenges  

2. **Motivation**: Computational sustainability models often fail to deploy successfully due to mismatches between controlled training environments and real-world conditions, such as noisy sensors, shifting climate patterns, or biased data collection. This gap limits progress toward UN SDGs like climate action and life on land. Current benchmarks prioritize accuracy over robustness, obscuring vulnerabilities to deployment pitfalls. Addressing this requires systematic evaluation of model resilience under realistic perturbations.  

3. **Main Idea**: Propose a benchmark suite for environmental tasks (e.g., species monitoring, deforestation detection) augmented with controlled perturbations simulating real-world challenges: sensor noise, missing data, and distributional shifts. Develop a framework combining adversarial training, uncertainty quantification (e.g., Bayesian neural networks), and data augmentation to improve robustness. Integrate stakeholder feedback loops to align model outputs with on-the-ground needs. Evaluate using metrics like perturbation robustness score (PRS) and deployment success rates. Expected outcomes include guidelines for stress-testing models pre-deployment and open-source tools to democratize access. This work aims to reduce duplicated effort, bridge the theory-deployment divide, and accelerate impactful solutions for sustainability challenges.
