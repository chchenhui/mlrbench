# DIRECT: Differentiable Implicit Combinatorial Optimization Through KKT Conditions

## 1. Introduction

Combinatorial optimization problems underpin many real-world applications, from supply chain management and transportation routing to resource allocation and scheduling. These problems, characterized by discrete decision variables and complex constraints, have traditionally been approached using specialized algorithms like branch-and-bound, dynamic programming, or metaheuristics. However, these methods typically operate as "black boxes" that cannot be easily integrated into gradient-based learning systems that dominate modern machine learning.

Recent advances in differentiable programming have sparked interest in developing differentiable versions of combinatorial optimization problems. The ability to backpropagate through optimization layers would enable end-to-end training of systems that incorporate combinatorial components, potentially leading to more efficient and effective solutions. Current approaches to differentiable combinatorial optimization generally fall into two categories: (1) relaxation-based methods that transform discrete variables into continuous ones, often using techniques like Gumbel-Softmax or softmax approximations, and (2) learning-based approaches that train neural networks to approximate the behavior of optimization algorithms.

However, these approaches face significant limitations. Relaxation-based methods often compromise solution quality by working with approximate continuous versions of the original discrete problems. This approximation error can be problematic in applications where precise, optimal solutions are required. Meanwhile, learning-based approaches typically require extensive training data and struggle to generalize to new problem instances or constraints. Furthermore, they rarely provide theoretical guarantees on solution optimality.

This research addresses these limitations by proposing DIRECT (Differentiable Implicit Combinatorial Optimization Through KKT Conditions), a novel framework that enables differentiable combinatorial optimization without sacrificing optimality guarantees or requiring training data. Our approach leverages the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions and implicit differentiation to compute gradients through the optimization process itself, rather than through a relaxed approximation or a learned proxy.

The key innovation of DIRECT lies in its ability to transform discrete combinatorial problems into equivalent continuous convex formulations that preserve optimality while enabling gradient computation. This transformation allows us to differentiate through the optimization process without compromising solution quality, a critical advantage in domains where high-precision solutions are essential. Moreover, our approach does not require training data, making it suitable for applications with limited available examples.

The research objectives of this proposal are:
1. Develop a mathematical framework for transforming discrete combinatorial optimization problems into equivalent differentiable formulations using KKT conditions
2. Establish theoretical guarantees on the optimality preservation and gradient accuracy of the proposed transformations
3. Design efficient algorithms for computing gradients through combinatorial optimization problems
4. Demonstrate the effectiveness of DIRECT on practical applications in routing, scheduling, and resource allocation

The significance of this research lies in its potential to bridge the gap between discrete optimization and differentiable programming, enabling the integration of combinatorial solvers into end-to-end learning systems without sacrificing solution quality. This could lead to significant advances in areas such as automated planning, logistics optimization, network design, and computational resource allocation. By providing a principled approach to differentiable combinatorial optimization without the need for training data, DIRECT offers a practical solution for real-world applications where optimality guarantees and data efficiency are critical concerns.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

We consider combinatorial optimization problems of the form:

$$
\min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x; \theta)
$$

where $x$ represents discrete decision variables, $\mathcal{X}$ is a discrete feasible set defined by constraints, $f$ is an objective function, and $\theta$ represents problem parameters that we wish to optimize. Our goal is to compute gradients of the optimal value or solution with respect to $\theta$, i.e., $\nabla_{\theta} f(x^*(\theta); \theta)$ or $\nabla_{\theta} x^*(\theta)$, where $x^*(\theta) = \arg\min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x; \theta)$.

### 2.2 Continuous Reformulation

The first step in our approach is to reformulate the discrete problem into an equivalent continuous convex problem. We propose a general transformation technique that maps discrete variables to continuous ones while preserving the problem structure. For binary variables, we use the following transformation:

$$
\mathcal{P}_{\text{discrete}}: \min_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} f(x; \theta) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathcal{P}_{\text{continuous}}: \min_{y \in [0,1]^n} \tilde{f}(y; \theta)
$$

where $\tilde{f}$ is designed such that:
1. $\tilde{f}$ is convex in $y$
2. The optimal solutions of $\mathcal{P}_{\text{continuous}}$ are at the vertices of the unit hypercube, ensuring integral solutions
3. These optimal solutions correspond exactly to optimal solutions of $\mathcal{P}_{\text{discrete}}$

For specific problem classes, we propose the following transformations:

1. **Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS)**: We reformulate the MWIS problem as:

$$
\max_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i \quad \text{s.t.} \quad x_i + x_j \leq 1 \quad \forall (i,j) \in E
$$

into the continuous problem:

$$
\max_{y \in [0,1]^n} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i y_i - \lambda \sum_{(i,j) \in E} y_i y_j
$$

where $\lambda > \max_i w_i$ ensures that optimal solutions are binary.

2. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: We use a formulation based on the assignment problem with subtour elimination:

$$
\min_{X \in \{0,1\}^{n \times n}} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n c_{ij} X_{ij}
$$

subject to assignment constraints and subtour elimination constraints.

The continuous reformulation uses a convex penalty function:

$$
\min_{Y \in [0,1]^{n \times n}} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n c_{ij} Y_{ij} + \gamma P(Y)
$$

where $P(Y)$ is a penalty function designed to enforce subtour elimination in a continuous manner.

### 2.3 Implicit Differentiation via KKT Conditions

Once we have the continuous convex reformulation, we can compute gradients using implicit differentiation through the KKT conditions. The KKT conditions for our continuous convex problem are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_y \tilde{f}(y^*; \theta) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i \nabla_y g_i(y^*) + \sum_{j=1}^p \mu_j \nabla_y h_j(y^*) &= 0 \\
g_i(y^*) &\leq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m \\
h_j(y^*) &= 0, \quad j = 1, \ldots, p \\
\lambda_i g_i(y^*) &= 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m \\
\lambda_i &\geq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m
\end{aligned}
$$

where $g_i$ and $h_j$ represent inequality and equality constraints, respectively, and $\lambda_i$ and $\mu_j$ are the corresponding Lagrange multipliers.

The gradient of the optimal value with respect to parameters $\theta$ can be computed as:

$$
\nabla_{\theta} f(y^*(\theta); \theta) = \nabla_{\theta} \tilde{f}(y^*; \theta) + \nabla_{\theta} y^* \cdot \nabla_y \tilde{f}(y^*; \theta)
$$

By the envelope theorem, when $y^*$ is optimal, the second term vanishes, simplifying to:

$$
\nabla_{\theta} f(y^*(\theta); \theta) = \nabla_{\theta} \tilde{f}(y^*; \theta)
$$

To compute gradients of the optimal solution $\nabla_{\theta} y^*$, we differentiate the KKT conditions with respect to $\theta$. This yields a system of linear equations:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\nabla^2_{yy} \mathcal{L} & \nabla_y g & \nabla_y h \\
\text{diag}(\lambda) \nabla_y g^T & \text{diag}(g) & 0 \\
\nabla_y h^T & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\nabla_{\theta} y^* \\
\nabla_{\theta} \lambda \\
\nabla_{\theta} \mu
\end{bmatrix}
=
-\begin{bmatrix}
\nabla^2_{y\theta} \mathcal{L} \\
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lagrangian of the problem.

### 2.4 Algorithm Implementation

We implement DIRECT using the following algorithm:

1. **Input**: Problem parameters $\theta$, objective function $f$, constraints defining feasible set $\mathcal{X}$
2. **Transform** the discrete problem into an equivalent continuous convex problem using the appropriate reformulation
3. **Solve** the continuous problem to obtain the optimal solution $y^*(\theta)$
4. **Compute** the KKT multipliers $\lambda$ and $\mu$ at the optimal solution
5. **Form** the KKT matrix and right-hand side vector
6. **Solve** the linear system to obtain $\nabla_{\theta} y^*$
7. **Compute** the desired gradients (either $\nabla_{\theta} f(y^*(\theta); \theta)$ or $\nabla_{\theta} y^*$)
8. **Output**: Optimal solution $y^*$ and gradients with respect to parameters

To ensure numerical stability, we employ regularization techniques and careful handling of active constraint sets. For large-scale problems, we use iterative methods to solve the linear system efficiently.
