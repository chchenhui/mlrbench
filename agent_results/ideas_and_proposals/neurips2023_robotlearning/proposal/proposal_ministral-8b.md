# Safe Adapter-Based Fine-Tuning for Vision–Language Robotics

## Introduction

The integration of large pre-trained models in robotics has shown great promise in enabling robots to perform high-level tasks with rich semantic understanding. However, direct deployment of these models on robotic hardware poses significant challenges, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and safety. Fine-tuning these models to specific tasks and embodiments under limited compute and data constraints is essential for practical deployment. This research proposal introduces a novel approach to safe adapter-based fine-tuning for vision–language robotics, addressing the need for parameter-efficient adaptation schemes that ensure safe, sample-efficient customization on new tasks and embodiments.

### Background

Large pre-trained vision–language models have revolutionized various domains by providing robust semantic understanding. However, their direct application in robotics is hindered by the need for extensive fine-tuning and the risk of unsafe deployment. Fine-tuning these models typically requires substantial computational resources and task-specific data, which can be impractical or cost-prohibitive in many real-world scenarios. Moreover, ensuring the safety of robotic operations is paramount, especially in dynamic and unpredictable environments.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are to:
1. Develop a lightweight, parameter-efficient adaptation scheme for fine-tuning vision–language models in robotics.
2. Ensure the safety of the fine-tuning process and the resulting robotic policies.
3. Achieve rapid adaptation to new tasks and embodiments with minimal computational resources and data.
4. Demonstrate robust generalization across object categories and environments.

### Significance

This research addresses a critical gap in the current state of the art, providing a practical and safe method for deploying large pre-trained models in robotics. By decoupling semantic reasoning from control adaptation, this approach democratizes the use of large models in real-world robotic applications, enabling more efficient and effective deployment.

## Methodology

### Overview

The proposed method involves introducing lightweight "safety adapters" into a frozen vision–language backbone. These adapters are designed to be small, modular layers that can be efficiently fine-tuned to specific tasks and embodiments. The approach consists of two main phases: pre-training and fine-tuning.

### Pre-Training

**Data Collection**: Pre-training data is collected from offline multi-modal logs, consisting of RGB–depth images paired with control trajectories. This data is representative of various robotic tasks and environments, enabling the model to generalize to unseen scenarios.

**Adapter Embeddings**: The adapter embeddings are aligned to robot state-action pairs using contrastive learning. This involves training the model to distinguish between positive and negative pairs of state-action sequences, thereby learning meaningful representations of the robot's behavior.

**Contrastive Learning**: The contrastive learning objective is formulated as follows:
\[ \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_i^+))}{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_i^+)) + \sum_{j \neq i} \exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_j))} \]
where \( z_i \) and \( z_i^+ \) are the embedding representations of the positive and negative pairs, respectively, and \( \text{sim} \) denotes the similarity function (e.g., dot product).

### Fine-Tuning

**Safety Constraints**: During fine-tuning, the adapters are updated with a safety-constrained reinforcement learning loop. The safety constraints are enforced by a learned critic that vetoes high-risk actions, ensuring safe exploration. The safety-constrained Q-learning objective is formulated as:
\[ \mathcal{L}_{\text{safety}} = \min_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \max_{z \in \mathcal{Z}} \left[ Q(z, a) - \gamma \max_{a' \in \mathcal{A}} Q(z, a') \right] \]
where \( Q(z, a) \) denotes the Q-value of state \( z \) and action \( a \), and \( \gamma \) is the discount factor.

**Reinforcement Learning Loop**: The reinforcement learning loop consists of the following steps:
1. **Action Selection**: An action is selected based on the current policy and the learned critic.
2. **State Transition**: The robot executes the selected action, resulting in a new state.
3. **Reward Calculation**: The reward is calculated based on the safety constraints and the achieved goal.
4. **Policy Update**: The policy is updated using the safety-constrained Q-learning objective.

### Experimental Design

**Dataset**: The pre-training dataset consists of offline multi-modal logs from various robotic tasks and environments. The fine-tuning dataset is collected from the target hardware, representing the specific task and embodiment.

**Evaluation Metrics**: The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using the following metrics:
1. **Adaptation Time**: The time required to fine-tune the model on the target hardware.
2. **Generalization Performance**: The model's ability to generalize to unseen object categories and environments.
3. **Safety Guarantees**: The proportion of safe actions taken during learning and deployment.

**Baseline Methods**: The proposed method is compared against several baseline methods, including:
1. Full model fine-tuning
2. Adapter-based fine-tuning without safety constraints
3. Safe reinforcement learning without adapters

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Rapid Adaptation**: The proposed method is expected to achieve rapid adaptation to new tasks and embodiments, with fine-tuning times of less than one hour on a single GPU.
2. **Robust Generalization**: The model is expected to generalize well across object categories and environments, demonstrating robust performance in diverse robotic tasks.
3. **Provable Safety Guarantees**: The safety-constrained reinforcement learning loop is expected to ensure safe exploration and deployment, providing provable safety guarantees during learning and operation.

### Impact

The proposed method has the potential to significantly advance the state of the art in safe adapter-based fine-tuning for vision–language robotics. By decoupling semantic reasoning from control adaptation, this approach democratizes the deployment of large pre-trained models in real-world robotic applications, enabling more efficient and effective use of these powerful tools. Furthermore, the method addresses the critical challenges of data efficiency, computational constraints, and generalization, paving the way for practical and safe deployment of large models in robotics.
