**1. Title:** Structure-Aware Dual-Stream Pretraining for Robust Tabular Language Models

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**

Tabular data constitutes a vast and critical component of the digital information landscape, underpinning everything from enterprise databases and scientific datasets to spreadsheets used in daily workflows (Borisov et al., 2021). As highlighted by the Table Representation Learning (TRL) workshop, tables are ubiquitous, yet their potential as a primary modality for representation learning and generative models has been historically underexplored compared to text or images. Recent years have witnessed growing interest in developing specialized machine learning models for tables, spurred by the success of pretraining paradigms in natural language processing (NLP). Models like TAPAS (Herzig et al., 2020) and TaBERT (Yin et al., 2020) demonstrated the feasibility of adapting transformer architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017) for tasks like table-based question answering (QA) and semantic parsing (e.g., text-to-SQL).

These pioneering works often linearize tables and rely heavily on the powerful contextualization capabilities of transformers to implicitly capture structure. While effective to a degree, they tend to prioritize cell content over explicit structural semantics. Consequently, they can struggle with the inherent complexities of real-world tables, such as nested or hierarchical headers, sparse relationships between columns, implicit relational constraints (e.g., primary/foreign keys), and diverse formatting conventions (Yang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020). This limitation hinders their robustness and generalization, particularly on tasks requiring deep comprehension of table schema and topology, like complex text-to-SQL translation or QA over multi-table databases.

Furthermore, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges. While LLMs exhibit remarkable few-shot and zero-shot capabilities on various tasks, their application to structured data often reveals similar weaknesses in interpreting complex table layouts and constraints accurately (Workshop Task Description). Efforts like UniTabE (Yang et al., 2023) and XTab (Zhu et al., 2023) explore universal pretraining protocols and cross-table learning to improve generalization, while TableFormer (Yang et al., 2022) integrates structural biases via learnable attention. However, a dedicated mechanism for explicitly modeling and reasoning over rich structural metadata alongside cell content remains a key research gap. Models incorporating tree structures (Li et al., 2025) or focusing on semantic type detection (Yao et al., 2019) address aspects of structure, but often not holistically integrated with content understanding at the pretraining stage.

**2.2 Research Gap and Proposed Idea**

Existing tabular pretraining methods often treat structure as secondary, either implicitly learned from serialized content or incorporated through relatively simple positional biases. They lack mechanisms to explicitly represent and leverage complex relational schema information (e.g., key constraints, column hierarchies, data types) during pretraining. This gap limits their ability to generalize to unseen, structurally complex tables and perform nuanced reasoning required for demanding tasks like advanced text-to-SQL or federated table QA.

To bridge this gap, we propose **S**tructure-**A**ware **D**ual-**S**tream **T**ransformer (SADST), a novel pretraining framework for tabular language models. SADST employs a dual-stream architecture that *concurrently* processes:
1.  **Content Stream:** Encodes the textual and numerical content of table cells, augmented with positional information.
2.  **Structure Stream:** Explicitly encodes rich structural metadata, including column headers, data types, and relational constraints (e.g., primary/foreign keys), potentially represented using graph-based techniques over the schema.

These streams interact through cross-attention mechanisms, enabling the model to ground content understanding in structural context and vice-versa. We hypothesize that by explicitly modeling and integrating structural semantics during pretraining via tailored objectives, SADST will develop a more robust and nuanced understanding of tables, leading to superior performance on structure-sensitive downstream tasks.

**2.3 Research Objectives**

The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop the SADST Architecture:** Design and implement a novel dual-stream transformer architecture capable of jointly encoding tabular content and explicit structural metadata. This includes defining effective input representations for both streams and designing interaction mechanisms (e.g., cross-attention).
2.  **Formulate Structure-Aware Pretraining Tasks:** Devise a set of self-supervised pretraining objectives that leverage both content and structure. These tasks will include Masked Cell Recovery (content focus), Schema Relation Prediction (structure focus), and Cross-Stream Alignment (content-structure interaction).
3.  **Pretrain SADST Models:** Pretrain SADST models on large-scale, diverse collections of tables encompassing varied structures and domains.
4.  **Evaluate Performance on Downstream Tasks:** Rigorously evaluate the pretrained SADST models on standard benchmark datasets for structure-sensitive tasks, specifically Text-to-SQL (e.g., Spider) and Table Question Answering (e.g., WikiTableQuestions).
5.  **Analyze Robustness and Ablate Contributions:** Conduct thorough ablation studies and robustness analyses to quantify the benefits of the dual-stream design, the explicit structure encoding, and each pretraining task, particularly on tables with complex structures or heterogeneous schemas.

**2.4 Significance**

This research holds significant potential contributions to the field of Table Representation Learning and its applications:

1.  **Advancing Foundational Models for Tables:** SADST offers a new paradigm for pretraining tabular models by prioritizing explicit structural understanding, potentially leading to more robust and generalizable representations.
2.  **Improving Performance on Critical Applications:** Enhanced table understanding can directly translate to improved performance in high-impact applications like natural language interfaces to databases (Text-to-SQL), complex data analysis, fact verification, data integration, and automated data science pipelines.
3.  **Addressing LLM Limitations:** By providing a mechanism to deeply integrate structural knowledge, SADST could inform techniques for improving LLM performance on structured data tasks, aligning with the TRL workshop's focus on LLMs for structured data.
4.  **Contribution to the Community:** We aim to release the pretrained SADST models and code, providing a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working with tabular data. The findings will also contribute insights into effective strategies for modeling table structure.
5.  **Alignment with TRL Workshop Goals:** This work directly addresses the workshop's aims by motivating tables as a primary modality, advancing representation learning techniques, showcasing potential application improvements (Text-to-SQL, QA), focusing on NLP for structured data, and tackling the challenge of handling complex table structures.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Data Collection and Preparation**

*   **Pretraining Corpus:** We will leverage large-scale, publicly available table corpora. Potential sources include:
    *   Web Tables: Collections like the Dresden Web Table Corpus or tables extracted from Common Crawl.
    *   Open Data Portals: Tables from government or institutional open data repositories.
    *   Specific Domains: Incorporating tables from domains like finance or bioinformatics if available and relevant.
    *   Synthetic Data: Potentially augmenting with synthetic tables generated using methods like TabTreeFormer (Li et al., 2025) focusing on structural diversity.
    The goal is to assemble a diverse dataset covering various schemas, sizes, domains, and structural complexities (e.g., simple flat tables, tables with multi-level headers, tables with explicit key constraints).
*   **Metadata Extraction:** A crucial step is extracting structural metadata for the Structure Stream. This will involve:
    *   **Header Identification:** Using heuristics or existing tools to identify single or multi-level headers.
    *   **Data Type Detection:** Applying type inference algorithms (e.g., based on content analysis, regular expressions, or potentially models like Sato (Yao et al., 2019)).
    *   **Relational Constraint Identification:** Extracting Primary Key (PK) and Foreign Key (FK) information where available (e.g., from database schemas, dataset documentation, or using inference techniques if necessary). For tables lacking explicit constraints, we might infer potential keys based on uniqueness or relationships across tables if applicable.
    The pretraining data will consist of tables paired with their extracted content and structural metadata.
*   **Downstream Task Datasets:** We will use established benchmarks for evaluation:
    *   **Text-to-SQL:** Spider (Yu et al., 2018) - A large-scale, complex, cross-domain text-to-SQL dataset requiring understanding of database schemas.
    *   **Table Question Answering:** WikiTableQuestions (Pasupat & Liang, 2015) - Requires reasoning over large Wikipedia tables.
    *   (Optional) Other relevant benchmarks like SQA (Iyyer et al., 2017) for sequential QA, TabFact (Chen et al., 2020) for fact verification, or domain-specific datasets.

**3.2 Proposed Model Architecture: SADST**

SADST will be based on the Transformer architecture.

*   **Input Representation:** A table $T$ with $M$ rows and $N$ columns, and its associated schema metadata $S$. The table is processed cell by cell.
*   **Content Stream:**
    *   **Input:** Each cell $c_{ij}$ is tokenized using a standard subword tokenizer (e.g., WordPiece). The input representation for a cell is the sum of its token embeddings and positional embeddings indicating its row $i$ and column $j$: $x_{ij}^{content} = E_{token}(T(c_{ij})) + E_{pos}(i, j)$. The sequence fed into the content stream transformer consists of these cell representations, potentially linearized row-by-row or column-by-column, interleaved with special tokens ([CLS], [SEP], [ROW], [COL]).
    *   **Processing:** A standard multi-layer Transformer encoder processes this sequence: $H^{content} = Transformer_{content}(X^{content})$.
*   **Structure Stream:**
    *   **Input:** The schema metadata $S$ includes column headers $H = \{h_1, ..., h_N\}$, data types $D = \{d_1, ..., d_N\}$, and relational constraints $R$ (e.g., PKs, FK pairs). We represent the schema as a graph where nodes correspond to columns.
    *   **Schema Graph Encoding:**
        1.  Each column $j$ gets an initial representation $s_j^0$ by combining embeddings of its properties: $s_j^0 = E_{hdr}(T(h_j)) + E_{type}(d_j) + \sum_{r \in R_j} E_{rel}(r)$, where $R_j$ are relations involving column $j$.
        2.  A Graph Neural Network (GNN), potentially a Graph Attention Network (GAT) (Veličković et al., 2018), operates over these column nodes, propagating information based on schema relationships (especially FK-PK links): $S_{emb} = GNN(\{s_j^0\}_{j=1}^N, R)$. This produces context-aware structure embeddings $S_{emb} = \{s_j^{final}\}_{j=1}^N$ for each column.
    *   **Processing:** These final structure embeddings $S_{emb}$ can be processed by another shallow Transformer encoder or used directly for interaction. $H^{struct} = Transformer_{struct}(S_{emb})$ (optional, could use $S_{emb}$ directly).
*   **Stream Interaction:**
    *   We propose using cross-attention layers within the Transformer blocks. Content Stream layers can attend to the structural embeddings ($S_{emb}$ or $H^{struct}$), and Structure Stream layers (if used) can attend to content representations ($H^{content}$).
    *   Formally, at layer $l$, cross-attention for the content stream might be:
        $$ \text{Attention}(Q=H^{content,(l)}, K=H^{struct}, V=H^{struct}) $$
        And potentially vice-versa. This allows the model to dynamically integrate information from both streams during processing.
    *   The final output representation combines information from both streams, either through concatenation followed by a linear layer or by using the outputs of the interacted streams directly.

**3.3 Pretraining Tasks**

We propose three self-supervised pretraining tasks, optimized jointly:

1.  **Masked Cell Recovery (MCR):** Similar to Masked Language Modeling (MLM). A fraction of input cell tokens are masked. The model must predict the original tokens based on the context from *both* the content stream (surrounding cells) and the structure stream (column information, relationships).
    *   Objective: Minimize cross-entropy loss $L_{MCR}$ between predicted and actual tokens.

2.  **Schema Relation Prediction (SRP):** Explicitly trains the Structure Stream and its interaction with content. Examples:
    *   **PK/FK Prediction:** Given two column representations (from the structure stream, possibly conditioned on some content), predict if an FK-PK relationship exists between them.
    *   **Data Type Prediction:** Given a column's representation (structure + maybe sample content values), predict its data type.
    *   **Header Prediction:** Mask parts of a column header and predict the masked tokens based on structure and content.
    *   Objective: Minimize classification loss (e.g., cross-entropy or binary cross-entropy) $L_{SRP}$ for these predictions.

3.  **Cross-Stream Alignment (CSA):** Ensure coherence between content and structure representations. We propose a contrastive learning approach:
    *   **Column Content Matching:** For a given column $j$, sample a positive set $P_j$ of cell values from that column and a negative set $N_j$ of cell values from other columns. The model should predict whether a set of cell values belongs to column $j$, using both content representations of the values and the structural representation $s_j^{final}$ of the column.
    *   Objective: Minimize a contrastive loss (e.g., InfoNCE) $L_{CSA}$ that encourages higher similarity between a column's structural embedding and representations of its actual content, compared to content from other columns.
        $$ L_{CSA} = - \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(s_j^{final}, \text{agg}(C_P)))}{\exp(\text{sim}(s_j^{final}, \text{agg}(C_P))) + \sum_{k \neq j} \exp(\text{sim}(s_j^{final}, \text{agg}(C_{N_k})))} $$
        where $\text{sim}$ is a similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity) and $\text{agg}$ aggregates cell representations (e.g., averaging embeddings).

*   **Overall Pretraining Objective:** The total loss is a weighted sum:
    $$ L_{pretrain} = w_1 L_{MCR} + w_2 L_{SRP} + w_3 L_{CSA} $$
    where $w_1, w_2, w_3$ are hyperparameters balancing the task contributions.

**3.4 Fine-tuning and Evaluation**

*   **Fine-tuning:** The pretrained SADST model will be fine-tuned on downstream tasks by adding a task-specific head and updating all parameters.
    *   **Text-to-SQL (Spider):** Add a sequence-to-sequence decoder head (or use an encoder-decoder base model) to generate SQL queries conditioned on the question and table schema representation from SADST.
    *   **Table QA (WikiTableQuestions):** Add a classification head (e.g., predicting answer cell) or a span prediction head over the linearized table content representation produced by SADST.
*   **Baselines:** We will compare SADST against strong baselines:
    *   General LLMs (e.g., BERT-Large, T5-Large) fine-tuned on tabular tasks.
    *   Specialized Table Pretrained Models: TAPAS (Herzig et al., 2020), TaBERT (Yin et al., 2020), TURL (Wang et al., 2020), TableFormer (Yang et al., 2022).
    *   Recent relevant models if available (e.g., UniTabE (Yang et al., 2023), potentially aspects of TabTreeFormer (Li et al., 2025) if comparable).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Spider:** Exact Set Match Accuracy (measures matching components of predicted vs gold SQL queries, ignoring values) and Execution Accuracy (measures if the predicted query yields the correct result when executed on the database).
    *   **WikiTableQuestions:** Accuracy (percentage of correctly answered questions).
*   **Ablation Studies:** To validate the design choices:
    *   SADST vs. Content-Stream only (removing Structure Stream and SRP/CSA tasks).
    *   SADST vs. simplified structure encoding (e.g., only positional embeddings vs. explicit schema graph).
    *   Impact of each pretraining task: Evaluating models trained without MCR, SRP, or CSA individually.
    *   Impact of schema metadata richness: Evaluating performance with varying levels of structural information (e.g., only headers vs. headers+types vs. headers+types+keys).
*   **Robustness Analysis:** Evaluate performance on subsets of data specifically chosen for structural complexity:
    *   Tables with multi-level headers.
    *   Tables requiring reasoning across multiple related columns (using FKs).
    *   Sparse tables or tables with unusual layouts.
    *   Comparison across different domains within benchmark datasets.

**3.5 Implementation Details**

We plan to implement SADST using PyTorch and the Hugging Face Transformers library. We will likely base our implementation on existing Transformer architectures (e.g., BERT-base/large or RoBERTa-base/large) for the content stream and adapt GNN libraries (like PyTorch Geometric) for the structure stream encoding. Pretraining will require significant computational resources (multiple GPUs, considerable time), typical for large model pretraining. We will detail hyperparameters (learning rates, batch sizes, optimizer, training epochs) during experimentation.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**

1.  **A Novel Pretrained Model (SADST):** We expect to successfully develop and pretrain the SADST model, demonstrating its capability to learn integrated representations of tabular content and structure.
2.  **State-of-the-Art Performance:** We anticipate that SADST will achieve competitive, potentially state-of-the-art, performance on the Spider and WikiTableQuestions benchmarks compared to existing baselines, particularly on complex instances requiring structural understanding.
3.  **Demonstrated Robustness:** Robustness analyses and ablation studies are expected to quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of the dual-stream architecture and explicit structure encoding, especially on tables with non-trivial structures and diverse schemas.
4.  **Validation of Pretraining Tasks:** The ablation studies should confirm the effectiveness of the proposed pretraining tasks (MCR, SRP, CSA) in contributing to the model's overall performance and structural understanding.
5.  **Dissemination:** We aim to publish our findings at a premier venue like the TRL workshop @ ACL 2025 or a related top-tier conference (ACL, EMNLP, NeurIPS, ICML). We plan to release the pretrained model weights and the associated code to facilitate reproducibility and further research by the community.

**4.2 Potential Impact**

*   **Scientific Impact:** This research will advance the understanding of how to effectively model complex structured data like tables within the deep learning paradigm. By demonstrating the value of explicit structure encoding via a dual-stream approach, it can inspire new architectures and pretraining strategies for tabular data and potentially other structured modalities. It directly contributes to the TRL workshop's goal of advancing table representation learning.
*   **Practical Impact:** Improvements in text-to-SQL and table QA capabilities have direct implications for data accessibility and analysis. More robust models can power more reliable natural language interfaces to databases, enhance automated data preparation and integration tools, improve fact-checking systems using tabular evidence, and enable more sophisticated interaction with structured data in conversational AI systems. This addresses the workshop's focus on impactful applications and challenges in domains dealing with complex structured data.
*   **Bridging Communities:** This work sits at the intersection of NLP, ML, and Databases, fostering cross-disciplinary insights relevant to the TRL workshop's goal of bringing these communities together. The focus on schema and relational structure explicitly connects ML modeling with database principles.

In conclusion, the proposed Structure-Aware Dual-Stream Pretraining framework aims to address a critical limitation in current tabular representation learning, paving the way for more robust and capable models for understanding and interacting with the vast world of structured data.
