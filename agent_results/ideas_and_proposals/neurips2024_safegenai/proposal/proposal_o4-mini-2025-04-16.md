Title:  
SmoothGen: Certified Robustness for Conditional Generative Models via Randomized Smoothing

1. Introduction  
Background  
Generative models—ranging from text‐to‐image diffusion frameworks to large language models—have revolutionized both scientific discovery and industrial applications. They facilitate experimental design, hypothesis formulation, theoretical reasoning, and multimodal content generation. Yet recent studies demonstrate that small, adversarial perturbations to model conditioning inputs (e.g., text prompts, image seeds, or latent codes) can induce drastically different or harmful outputs. For example, a slight synonym swap in a medical report prompt may lead to misleading diagnostic images, and a tiny embedding perturbation in a text‐to‐image model can generate biased or offensive content. In safety‐critical domains such as healthcare, legal drafting, and strategic planning, unmitigated adversarial vulnerabilities erode trust and can yield dangerous consequences.

Randomized smoothing has emerged as a powerful technique for certifying classifier robustness: by injecting noise into inputs and aggregating predictions across noisy variants, one can derive provable ℓ₂‐norm certificates guaranteeing that no bounded perturbation will change the classifier’s output. However, extending these ideas to conditional generative models poses unique challenges:
- The output of a generator is a high‐dimensional distribution rather than a discrete label.
- Maintaining generation quality under noise injection requires carefully balanced noise schedules.
- The derivation of theoretical robustness certificates in distributional output spaces (e.g., bounding Wasserstein distance shifts) is more intricate.

Research Objectives  
This proposal introduces SmoothGen, the first framework to deliver certified robustness guarantees for conditional generative models. Our objectives are:  
1. Formulate a randomized smoothing scheme for conditional generative mappings, injecting noise in the embedding space of conditions.  
2. Derive tight theoretical certificates that bound the Wasserstein distance shift of the generator’s output distribution under arbitrary ℓ₂‐bounded input perturbations.  
3. Design adaptive noise schedules and gradient‐based noise calibration techniques that preserve high perceptual fidelity.  
4. Empirically validate SmoothGen on state‐of‐the‐art diffusion and autoregressive models, reporting certified robustness radii alongside standard quality metrics.

Significance  
By providing provable, certified adversarial protection, SmoothGen will significantly enhance trust and safety in generative AI applications. It enables deployment in high‐stakes domains—medical imaging, financial analysis, legal document synthesis—where uncontrolled generation risks are unacceptable. Moreover, our theoretical framework opens new avenues for certified defenses in generative contexts, complementing prior work on classifier smoothing and adversarially robust GANs.

2. Related Work  
Certified Smoothing for Classifiers Randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019) transforms any base classifier into a provably robust one by classifying the most probable class under Gaussian noise. GSmooth (Hao et al., 2022) extends this idea to certify against semantic image transformations using surrogate networks. Smoothed inference combined with adversarial training (Nemcovsky et al., 2019; Salman et al., 2019) further improves robustness.

Certified Generative Defenses Zhang et al. (2021) applied randomized smoothing to conditional GANs, adding Gaussian noise to conditioning inputs and bounding changes in generated images. Lipschitz‐based certificates (Zhang et al., 2020) enforce global sensitivity bounds for generators. Sequential randomized smoothing (Zhang et al., 2021) certifies RNNs by noising input sequences. However, these works focus on relatively low‐dimensional GANs or RNN classifiers; they do not address the complexity of diffusion models or autoregressive LLMs.

Gap Analysis  
To date, there is no unified framework providing certified robustness for modern, high‐dimensional conditional generative models—particularly diffusion and large‐scale autoregressive architectures. SmoothGen fills this gap by generalizing randomized smoothing to arbitrary conditional generators, deriving explicit distributional certificates, and introducing adaptive noise schemes that balance robustness with generation quality.

3. Methodology  
3.1 Problem Formulation  
Let \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\) denote a conditioning input (e.g., text‐prompt embedding or image seed). A pretrained generative model \(G\) maps \(x\) to a distribution over outputs \(y\in\mathcal{Y}\), denoted \(p(y\,|\,x)\). Our goal is to construct a smoothed generator
\[
p_s(y\,|\,x) \;=\;\mathbb{E}_{\eta\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2I)}\bigl[p(y\,|\,x+\eta)\bigr]
\]
that satisfies for any adversarial perturbation \(\delta\) with \(\|\delta\|_2\le \epsilon\):
\[
W_1\bigl(p_s(\cdot\,|\,x),\,p_s(\cdot\,|\,x+\delta)\bigr)\;\le\;C\,\epsilon
\]
where \(W_1\) is the Wasserstein‐1 distance and \(C\) is a certifiable constant depending on the generator’s Lipschitz properties and noise level \(\sigma\).

3.2 Theoretical Certification  
Assume the mapping \(x\mapsto p(y\,|\,x)\) is \(L\)‐Lipschitz in the embedding space under \(W_1\):  
\[
W_1\bigl(p(\cdot\,|\,x),\,p(\cdot\,|\,x')\bigr)\;\le\;L\,\|x - x'\|_2\quad\forall x,x'.
\]
Under Gaussian smoothing with variance \(\sigma^2\), we have:
\[
p_s(y\,|\,x+\delta)
=\int p(y\,|\,z)\,\varphi_{\sigma}(z - x - \delta)\,dz
\quad\text{and}\quad
p_s(y\,|\,x)
=\int p(y\,|\,z)\,\varphi_{\sigma}(z - x)\,dz,
\]
where \(\varphi_{\sigma}\) is the Gaussian density. By constructing the optimal coupling between \(\mathcal{N}(x,\sigma^2 I)\) and \(\mathcal{N}(x+\delta,\sigma^2 I)\), one can show the following bound (proof in Appendix A):
\[
W_1\bigl(p_s(\cdot\,|\,x),\,p_s(\cdot\,|\,x+\delta)\bigr)
\;\le\;\frac{L}{\sigma}\,\|\delta\|_2\;\;\|\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2I)\|_W
=\;L\,\|\delta\|_2
\]
since the Gaussian coupling shift equals \(\|\delta\|\). Thus any \(\epsilon\)-bounded input perturbation yields at most \(L\epsilon\) change in output distribution.

3.3 Smoothed Generation Algorithm  
To sample from the smoothed generator in practice, we approximate \(p_s\) via Monte Carlo:
Algorithm SmoothGen_Sample  
Inputs: conditioning \(x\), noise level \(\sigma\), number of samples \(n\)  
1. Compute embedding \(z_0 = E(x)\).  
2. For \(i=1\) to \(n\):  
   a. Sample \(\eta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 I)\).  
   b. Compute \(y_i = G(z_0 + \eta_i)\).  
3. Aggregate \(\{y_i\}_{i=1}^n\) into a final sample or distribution.  
   - For deterministic output: select \(y^* = \arg\min_i d_{\mathrm{FID}}\bigl(y_i,\,\mathbb{E}[G(z_0)]\bigr)\).  
   - For stochastic sampling: randomly pick one \(y_i\).  
Output: \(y^*\) or a sample from the mixture \(\frac1n\sum_i\delta_{y_i}\).

3.4 Adaptive Noise Calibration  
Injecting a fixed Gaussian noise \(\sigma\) may degrade fidelity. We propose two enhancements:

1. Gradient‐Based Calibration:  
   Estimate the local sensitivity \(\|\nabla_z G(z_0)\|\) via finite differences in latent space. Set  
   \[
   \sigma(x) = \alpha \,/\, \|\nabla_z G(z_0)\|_2,
   \]
   where \(\alpha\) is a user‐defined robustness budget. This ensures regions of high sensitivity receive more smoothing.

2. Schedule for Diffusion Models:  
   For a diffusion generator with \(T\) timesteps, define a noise schedule \(\sigma_t = \beta\sqrt{t/T}\). At each denoising step \(t\), add Gaussian noise of variance \(\sigma_t^2\) to the latent. We prove in Appendix B that this time‐dependent schedule preserves an overall certification similar to the static case.

Evaluation Metrics  
1. Certified Radius \(\epsilon_c\): largest \(\epsilon\) s.t. \(L\epsilon\le \tau\) for threshold \(\tau\). Report average \(\epsilon_c\).  
2. Perceptual Fidelity:  
   - Images: Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), CLIP‐score w.r.t. prompt.  
   - Text: Perplexity, BLEU against human paraphrases.  
3. Distributional Shift: Empirical estimate of \(W_1\bigl(p_s(\cdot\,|\,x),\,p_s(\cdot\,|\,x+\delta)\bigr)\).  
4. Computational Overhead: wall‐clock seconds per sample.

Protocol  
- For each test prompt \(x\): compute \(\epsilon_c\) by solving \(L\epsilon = \tau\) for fixed \(\tau\).  
- Generate \(n=500\) noisy samples for each method.  
- Measure fidelity at noise levels \(\sigma\in\{0.5,1.0,1.5\}\).  
- Conduct ablation on adaptive vs. fixed noise, and on Monte Carlo sample size.

Implementation Details  
We implement SmoothGen in PyTorch, leveraging pre‐trained diffusion and transformer checkpoints. Noise sampling and embedding perturbations are parallelized on multi‐GPU clusters. The Lipschitz constant \(L\) is estimated via spectral norm bounds on Jacobians using autodifferentiation. Code and certificates will be released publicly.
