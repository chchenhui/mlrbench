# SmoothGen – Certified Robustness via Randomized Smoothing for Conditional Generative Models

## Introduction

### Background
Generative models, including diffusion models, large language models (LLMs), and vision-language models, have revolutionized domains ranging from scientific discovery to commercial applications. However, their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations—small, imperceptible changes in input conditions—poses critical risks. For instance, a medical imaging system using conditional diffusion models could generate misdiagnosed tissue reconstructions if adversarial noise is introduced into the clinical metadata. Similarly, LLMs in legal drafting may produce misleading contractual clauses under subtle input tampering. These vulnerabilities underscore the urgent need for **certified robustness** frameworks that mathematically guarantee output stability under bounded input perturbations.

### Literature Review & Research Gap
Randomized smoothing (RS), a foundational technique for achieving certified robustness in classification models, has recently seen extensions to specific generative frameworks. Key prior works include:
1. **Generalized Smoothing (GSmooth)** [Ref 2]: Certified robustness against semantic transformations via surrogate networks.
2. **Conditional GANs with RS** [Ref 7]: First application of RS to generative models, but limited to low-resolution images and fixed noise schedules.
3. **Lipschitz-based Certificates** [Ref 9]: Enforces output stability via architectural constraints, sacrificing generation quality for robustness.

Despite progress, critical limitations persist:
- **Scalability**: Existing methods struggle with high-dimensional outputs (e.g., 1024×1024 images or long text sequences).
- **Adaptive Noise Control**: Uniform noise addition degrades generation quality; no prior work addresses input-specific noise calibration.
- **Theoretical Gaps**: Lack of formal guarantees for Wasserstein distances between output distributions under adversarial perturbations.

### Research Objectives & Significance
This proposal addresses these gaps through **SmoothGen**, a framework that:
1. Extends RS to **conditional generative models** (diffusion models, LLMs, and vision-language models) with:
   - **Latent-space noise injection** to preserve input semantics.
   - **Gradient-based adaptive noise calibration** to balance robustness and fidelity.
2. Derives **Wasserstein stability certificates** bounding output shifts under adversarial perturbations.
3. Validates the framework on **high-resolution generation tasks** (e.g., medical imaging, code generation).

Significance includes enabling safe deployment in security-critical domains (e.g., healthcare, judiciary) and advancing theoretical understanding of robustness in generative AI.

## Methodology

### Data Collection & Datasets
1. **Benchmark Datasets**:
   - **Image Generation**: LSUN-Bedroom (256×256), FFHQ (512×512), and MedNIST (medical imaging).
   - **Text Generation**: Legal Case Reports (LeCA dataset), Python Code Tasks (HUMAN-EVAL).
   - **Vision-Language**: COCO Captions, VQA v2 (visual question answering).

2. **Adversarial Evaluation**:
   - Generate bounded ℓ₂/ℓ∞ perturbations in conditioning inputs using PGD attacks.
   - Construct synthetic "worst-case" conditions (e.g., medical metadata with noise).

### Algorithm Design

#### 1. Randomized Smoothing for Generative Models
Let $ G: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{Y}) $ be a conditional generator (e.g., a diffusion model) mapping inputs $ \mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X} $ to output distributions. SmoothGen constructs a **stochastic smoothed generator** $ \tilde{G} $ as follows:
1. Sample $ N $ noisy inputs:  
   $$ \mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{x}_0 + \varepsilon_i, \quad \varepsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 \mathbf{I}) $$
2. Aggregate outputs:  
   $$ \tilde{G}(\mathbf{x}_0) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N G(\mathbf{x}_i) $$
   For diffusion models: Average noise trajectories in latent space.  
   For LLMs: Softmax averaging across $ G(\mathbf{x}_i) $ token distributions.

#### 2. Theoretical Certificates
Define the **Wasserstein robustness certificate** as the minimum perturbation $ \Delta \mathbf{x} $ that causes a $ \delta $-Wasserstein shift in outputs. Using the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality [Ref 9], we derive:
$$
\mathbb{E}_{\varepsilon} [W_p(\tilde{G}(\mathbf{x}_0), \tilde{G}(\mathbf{x}_0 + \Delta \mathbf{x})))] \leq \sigma \cdot \sqrt{2 \log(1/\beta)} + \gamma \cdot \|\Delta \mathbf{x}\|_2
$$
where:
- $ \sigma $: noise scale
- $ \beta $: smoothing confidence parameter
- $ \gamma $: Lipschitz constant of the base generator

This guarantees that for any input perturbation $ \|\Delta \mathbf{x}\|_2 \leq R $, the output distribution shift is bounded by:
$$
W_p \leq \sigma \cdot \sqrt{2 \log(1/\beta)} + \gamma R
$$

#### 3. Adaptive Noise Calibration
To preserve generation quality, we dynamically adjust $ \sigma(\mathbf{x}) $ based on input complexity:
- Compute gradient sensitivity:  
  $$ \eta(\mathbf{x}) = \|\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x})\|_2 $$
- Set noise scale:  
  $$ \sigma(\mathbf{x}) = \sigma_{\min} + (\sigma_{\max} - \sigma_{\min}) \cdot \frac{\eta(\mathbf{x}) - \eta_{\min}}{\eta_{\max} - \eta_{\min}} $$
This increases noise where inputs are highly sensitive (e.g., legal clauses with rare keywords) and reduces it otherwise.

### Experimental Design

#### 1. Baselines
- **Adversarial Training** [Ref 4]: Augment training with PGD-perturbed data.
- **Lipschitz-Constrained GANs** [Ref 9]: Spectral normalization in generator.
- **Vanilla RS** [Ref 7]: Fixed-noise smoothing without adaptation.

#### 2. Evaluation Metrics
| Metric | Purpose | Implementation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Certified Radius** $ R $ | Robustness guarantee | Compute maximum $ \|\Delta \mathbf{x}\|_2 $ with validated $ W_p $ bound |
| **FID Score** | Perceptual quality | Compare with real data distributions |
| **Attack Success Rate** | Empirical robustness | Test PGD/black-box attacks |
| **Human Evaluation** | Trade-off analysis | Crowdworkers rate coherence vs. artifacts |
| **Latency Overhead** | Computational cost | Measure inference time per sample |

#### 3. Implementation Details
- **Noise Injection**: In diffusion models, perturb the text/image encoder's CLIP embeddings. In LLMs, add noise to token embeddings.
- **Efficient Sampling**: Use parallelized inference on TPUs/GPUs to amortize cost across $ N $ samples (default $ N=100 $).
- **Hyperparameters**: Grid search over $ \sigma_{\min} \in [0.1, 0.5] $, $ \sigma_{\max} \in [0.5, 1.2] $, with early stopping via validation FID.

2. **Adaptive Smoothing Mechanism** that retains ≥95% of baseline generation quality (measured by CLIP score) while improving robustness by 2× vs. fixed-noise RS.
3. **Theoretical Generalization** of Wasserstein certificates to sequential/tensor-valued outputs.

2. **Legal Tech**: Reduce risks of malicious prompt tampering in AI-assisted contract drafting.
3. **Content Moderation**: Certify resistance to generation of harmful content under perturbed inputs.

### Limitations & Future Work
- **Computational Cost**: Inference latency increases linearly with $ N $; future work could explore Monte Carlo variance reduction.
- **Distribution Shift**: Certificates assume iid test inputs; out-of-distribution robustness remains an open challenge.
