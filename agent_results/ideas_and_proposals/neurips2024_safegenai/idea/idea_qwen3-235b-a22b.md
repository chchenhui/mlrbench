**Title:** Calibrating Confidence in Generative Models via Adversarial Uncertainty Distillation  

**Motivation:** Generative models often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, producing highly plausible yet factually incorrect or misleading content. This undermines trust and safety in critical applications like healthcare, education, and scientific research. Addressing overconfidence is essential to ensure users can reliably assess the validity of generated content.  

**Main Idea:** We propose an adversarial uncertainty distillation framework to calibrate confidence scores in generative models. A lightweight "uncertainty discriminator" will be trained to identify overconfident outputs by contrasting model predictions against diverse external knowledge sources (e.g., verified databases, symbolic reasoning engines). This discriminator will then guide the generative model to adjust its confidence via adversarial training, encouraging it to assign lower confidence to uncertain or out-of-distribution inputs. The method will be architecture-agnostic, enabling deployment as a post-hoc calibration layer for existing models. We expect this approach to reduce overconfidence errors by 30-40% on benchmarks like TruthfulQA and scientific hypothesis-generation tasks, while maintaining generation quality. Success would enable safer AI deployment in high-stakes domains by providing interpretable confidence metrics and reducing reliance on potentially flawed outputs.
