## Title: Dynamic Knowledge-Driven Integration of Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning for Open-World Agents

### Introduction

Open-world environments pose significant challenges for AI agents, requiring them to generalize across diverse tasks, adapt to unseen scenarios, and continuously learn from new experiences. Traditional AI systems often treat reasoning and decision-making as separate processes, leading to suboptimal performance in dynamic environments. This research proposal aims to bridge this gap by developing a hybrid architecture that unifies symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) through a shared, evolving knowledge repository. By integrating large language models (LLMs) for high-level planning and contextual reasoning with RL agents for real-time decision-making, we aim to create open-world agents capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human supervision.

The primary objective of this research is to develop a framework that enables open-world agents to:
1. Interleave reasoning and decision-making seamlessly.
2. Adapt to unseen tasks and environments efficiently.
3. Transfer knowledge across tasks to improve sample efficiency.
4. Balance exploration and exploitation effectively.
5. Minimize the need for human supervision while maintaining high performance.

### Methodology

#### 1. System Architecture

The proposed framework consists of three main components:
- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: A pre-trained LLM that generates high-level plans and contextual reasoning based on prior knowledge and environmental inputs.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent**: An RL agent that executes low-level actions based on the plans generated by the LLM, learning from environmental feedback.
- **Dynamic Knowledge Repository**: A shared, evolving repository that stores and updates knowledge gained from experiences, facilitating the transfer of knowledge across tasks.

#### 2. Data Collection

Data will be collected from diverse, open-world environments such as Minecraft, robotics simulators, and other interactive textual environments. This data will include task descriptions, environmental states, and corresponding actions. For pretraining the LLM, we will use a combination of publicly available datasets and domain-specific datasets relevant to the target environments.

#### 3. Algorithm Design

**Pretraining the LLM**: The LLM will be pretrained on diverse task descriptions and commonsense knowledge using self-supervised learning objectives such as masked language modeling and next sentence prediction.

**Training the RL Agent**: The RL agent will be trained via self-play in simulated open-world environments with sparse rewards. The training process will involve:
- Initializing the RL agent with a random policy.
- Generating trajectories by interacting with the environment using the current policy.
- Updating the policy based on the collected trajectories and sparse rewards using an RL algorithm such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

**Aligning LLM-generated Subgoals with RL-learned State Representations**: We will use contrastive learning to align the LLM's subgoals with the RL agent's state representations. This will involve:
- Encoding the LLM's subgoals and the RL agent's state representations using separate encoders.
- Computing the contrastive loss between the subgoals and state representations.
- Updating the encoders to minimize the contrastive loss.

**Dynamic Knowledge Update**: The dynamic knowledge repository will be updated continuously with new experiences. This will involve:
- Extracting relevant knowledge from the experiences using the LLM.
- Storing the extracted knowledge in the repository.
- Using the updated repository to refine future reasoning and decision-making.

#### 4. Experimental Design

To validate the proposed framework, we will conduct experiments in various open-world environments, including:
- **Minecraft**: Evaluating the agent's ability to complete diverse tasks such as mining, crafting, and navigating.
- **Robotics Simulators**: Assessing the agent's performance in tasks like object manipulation, navigation, and task completion.
- **Interactive Textual Environments**: Testing the agent's capability to engage in dialogue, answer questions, and execute tasks based on textual inputs.

#### 5. Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the proposed framework will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Task Completion Rate**: The percentage of tasks successfully completed by the agent.
- **Sample Efficiency**: The number of samples required to achieve a certain level of performance.
- **Generalization**: The agent's ability to adapt to unseen tasks and environments.
- **Human Feedback**: The reduction in human supervision required to maintain or improve agent performance.
- **Computational Efficiency**: The computational resources and time required to train and deploy the agent.

### Expected Outcomes & Impact

The proposed research is expected to yield several significant outcomes:

1. **Improved Generalization**: The hybrid architecture will enable open-world agents to generalize across diverse tasks and environments, reducing the need for extensive retraining.

2. **Reduced Sample Complexity**: By transferring knowledge across tasks, the framework will improve sample efficiency, allowing agents to learn more effectively with fewer samples.

3. **Emergent Multi-Step Task Completion**: The integration of reasoning and decision-making will enable agents to complete complex, multi-step tasks without explicit programming.

4. **Minimized Human Supervision**: The dynamic knowledge repository and contrastive learning approach will reduce the reliance on human feedback, making the framework more scalable and cost-effective.

5. **Advancements in Autonomous Systems**: The proposed framework has the potential to advance autonomous agents in domains requiring both creativity and precision, such as disaster response robotics, personalized AI assistants, and game AI.

### Conclusion

The development of open-world agents that can seamlessly interleave reasoning and decision-making is a critical challenge in AI research. This research proposal outlines a hybrid architecture that combines large language models for symbolic reasoning with reinforcement learning for dynamic decision-making, unified via a shared, evolving knowledge repository. By addressing key challenges such as integration, adaptation, knowledge transfer, and minimizing human supervision, this framework has the potential to significantly advance the field of open-world AI, enabling agents to handle complex, real-world tasks with greater efficiency and effectiveness.
