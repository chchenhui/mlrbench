Title:
Dynamic Knowledge-Driven Integration of Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning for Open-World Agents

1. Introduction  
1.1 Background  
Open-world environments present AI agents with a diversity of tasks, non-stationary dynamics, sparse rewards, and continual changes that go beyond the assumptions of fixed MDPs or static benchmarks. Success in such domains requires the tight integration of two complementary capabilities:  
- Symbolic reasoning and planning, which provide sample-efficient, compositional handling of novel subgoals;  
- Reactive decision-making via reinforcement learning (RL), which adapts low-level control policies to unpredictable feedback.  

Recent works have begun closing the gap. Chen et al. (2025) formalize interactive LLM agents as POMDPs and train them with LOOP, a PPO variant that yields stateful, multi-domain competence. Carta et al. (2023) ground LLMs in textual environments through online RL, improving sample efficiency. Feng et al. (2023) propose LLaMA-Rider, which uses multi-round feedback for subtask relabeling in Minecraft. Qi et al. (2024) introduce WebRL, a self-evolving curriculum for web agents. Despite these advances, existing systems either treat reasoning and decision-making in isolation or rely on brittle hand-crafted pipelines that do not generalize to unseen tasks. Key challenges remain: seamless module integration, efficient knowledge transfer across tasks, balancing exploration and exploitation in a dynamic setting, and minimizing human supervision.

1.2 Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a hybrid architecture—Dynamic Knowledge-Driven Reasoning-RL Agent (DKR2A)—that unifies LLM-based symbolic reasoning with RL-based control via a shared, evolving memory. Our specific objectives are:  
  • Design an interface whereby an LLM generates high-level plans and subgoals conditioned on a task description and evolving memory.  
  • Train an RL policy to execute these subgoals in simulated open-world environments, receiving sparse feedback.  
  • Implement a dynamic knowledge repository that stores and retrieves episodic experiences, enabling continual learning.  
  • Align the LLM’s subgoal representations with the RL policy’s state embeddings using contrastive learning.  
  • Evaluate generalization to unseen tasks, sample efficiency, and emergent multi-step reasoning in domains such as Minecraft and robot simulators.  

1.3 Significance  
A successful integration will push open-world agents toward human-level versatility by:  
  • Improving generalization across unseen tasks through compositional reasoning and memory reuse.  
  • Reducing sample complexity via informed planning and subgoal decomposition.  
  • Minimizing human supervision by leveraging self-play, automated feedback, and continual memory updates.  
  • Enabling deployment in critical applications such as disaster-response robotics, adaptive game AI, and LLM-driven workflow automation.

2. Methodology  
2.1 Overview of the DKR2A Architecture  
DKR2A consists of three interacting modules (Figure 1):  
  1. LLM Reasoner $R_{\theta}$: a pretrained transformer that, given task context $c_t$ and retrieved memory $m_t$, outputs a plan $p_t$ and subgoals $\{g^i_t\}$.  
  2. RL Executor $\pi_{\phi}$: a policy network that conditions on the current state $s_t$ and the current subgoal embedding $e(g^i_t)$ to select action $a_t$.  
  3. Dynamic Memory Module $M$: an episodic buffer that stores tuples $(c, p, s, g, a, r, s')$ and returns a contextually relevant set of experiences via a retrieval function $\mathcal{R}(c_t, s_t) = m_t$.  

2.2 Formal Problem Definition  
We frame each task as an MDP $\mathcal{M}=(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},P,r,\gamma)$ drawn from a distribution $\mathcal{T}$. At timestep $t$, the agent:  
  1. Observes partial context $c_t$ (textual description, current state $s_t$).  
  2. Retrieves memory $m_t = \mathcal{R}(c_t,s_t)\subset M$.  
  3. Generates plan $p_t,\{g^i_t\}=R_{\theta}(c_t,m_t)$.  
  4. For each subgoal $g^i_t$, executes actions by sampling $a_{t,i}\sim \pi_{\phi}(a\mid s_{t,i},e(g^i_t))$ until termination.  
  5. Updates memory with new transition tuples.  

2.3 Module Details  
2.3.1 LLM Reasoner  
We fine-tune a pretrained LLM (e.g. LLaMA-2) on a mixture of:  
  • Task descriptions and annotated high-level plans (crowdsourced and synthetic).  
  • Commonsense knowledge bases (ConceptNet, ATOMIC).  

At inference, the LLM samples a plan $p_t$ of length $L$ and subgoals $\{g^1_t,\dots,g^L_t\}$ via:  
$$
p_t,\{g^i_t\} \sim R_{\theta}\bigl(\underbrace{[c_t; m_t]}_{\text{input sequence}}\bigr)\,.
$$

2.3.2 RL Executor  
We define an augmented state representation $\tilde s_t=[s_t; e(g^i_t)]$, where $e(\cdot)$ is an embedding network. The policy $\pi_{\phi}(a\mid \tilde s)$ is trained with PPO to maximize expected return:  
$$
J(\phi)=\mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\phi}}\Bigl[\sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t r_t\Bigr]\,.
$$

2.3.3 Dynamic Memory Module  
Memory $M$ is a key–value store where keys are embeddings of $(c,s)$ and values are associated $(p,\{g\},a,r,s')$. Retrieval uses k-nearest neighbors in embedding space. After each episode, new experiences $(c_t,p_t,s_t,g_t,a_t,r_t,s_{t+1})$ are appended and older ones pruned by relevance.  

2.3.4 Contrastive Alignment  
To align LLM subgoal embeddings with RL state embeddings, we minimize a contrastive loss at each subgoal step:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CL}}=-\log\frac{\exp\bigl(\mathrm{sim}(e_{\mathrm{LLM}}(g^i_t),h^{+}_t)/\tau\bigr)}
{\sum_{h^{-}\in \mathcal{N}}\exp\bigl(\mathrm{sim}(e_{\mathrm{LLM}}(g^i_t),h^{-})/\tau\bigr)}\,,
$$  
where $h^{+}_t$ is the encoder output for the matching RL state $s_{t,i}$, $\mathcal{N}$ are negative samples, $\mathrm{sim}$ is cosine similarity, and $\tau$ a temperature.

2.4 Training Procedure  
Algorithm 1 summarizes our joint training loop.  
Algorithm 1: DKR2A Joint Training  
1. Pretrain $R_{\theta}$ on textual corpora with planar annotations.  
2. Initialize $\pi_{\phi}$ randomly; $M=\emptyset$.  
3. For each iteration:  
   a. Sample a batch of tasks from $\mathcal{T}$.  
   b. For each task:  
      i. Roll out using $R_{\theta}$ and $\pi_{\phi}$, collect transitions.  
      ii. Update memory $M$.  
   c. Update $\phi$ via PPO objective on collected trajectories.  
   d. Update $\theta$ by minimizing $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CL}}$ plus plan-generation loss (cross-entropy on synthetic plans).  
4. Periodically fine-tune $R_{\theta}$ on newly acquired memory to refine reasoning.

2.5 Experimental Design  
Environments:  
  • Minecraft (MineRL suite) for crafting and exploration tasks.  
  • MuJoCo-based robotic manipulation (block stacking, object sorting).  

Baselines and Ablations:  
  1. RL-only (no reasoning module).  
  2. Reasoning-only (LLM plan + scripted executor).  
  3. DKR2A w/o memory updates.  
  4. DKR2A w/o contrastive alignment.  

Evaluation Metrics:  
  • Success Rate in test tasks (unseen recipes or manipulations).  
  • Sample Efficiency: episodes to reach 80% success.  
  • Generalization Score: performance drop from train to test tasks.  
  • Subgoal Alignment Accuracy: fraction of subgoals leading to intended state changes.  
  • Planning Overhead: average time per plan.  

Statistical Analysis:  
Report mean ± standard error over 10 seeds. Use paired t-tests to compare DKR2A against baselines ($p<0.05$).

2.6 Implementation Details  
  • LLM: 7B–13B parameter LLaMA-2. Learning rate $5e^{-5}$.  
  • RL policy: two-layer MLP, hidden size 256, PPO clip $ε=0.2$, discount $\gamma=0.99$.  
  • Memory capacity: 50 000 tuples, retrieval $k=32$.  
  • Contrastive temperature $\tau=0.07$.  
  • Training hardware: 64 TPU cores for LLM, 512 CPU workers for RL simulation.
