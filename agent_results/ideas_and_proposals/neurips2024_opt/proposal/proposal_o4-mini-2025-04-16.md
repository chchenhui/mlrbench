Title:  
Optimization-Aware Scaling Laws for Efficient Hyperparameter Transfer in Large Model Training  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Optimization underlies nearly every aspect of machine learning, from basic linear regression to state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Traditional scaling laws relate model performance to model size, dataset size, and compute budget, but largely ignore the role of optimizer hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, momentum). As modern LLMs grow from millions to hundreds of billions of parameters, naïve hyperparameter tuning becomes prohibitively expensive in terms of time, cost, and environmental impact. Current practice often relies on extensive grid or random searches on smaller models and heuristic extrapolation to larger ones—an approach that produces suboptimal results and considerable waste.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to fill this gap by developing optimization-aware scaling laws that model how optimal hyperparameters vary with model size $N$, dataset size $D$, and optimizer choice $O$. Our specific objectives are:  
1. To empirically map optimal hyperparameters $(\eta^*, B^*, m^*, \ldots)$ across a range of model scales and optimization algorithms.  
2. To fit analytical scaling laws of the form  
   $$\eta^*(N,D,O) = \alpha_O \, N^{-\gamma_O} D^{-\delta_O},\quad B^*(N,D,O)=\beta_O\,D^{\epsilon_O},$$  
   and similar expressions for momentum $m^*$ and weight decay.  
3. To package these fitted laws into a lightweight recommendation framework that, given a target $(N,D,O)$, produces near-optimal hyperparameters without exhaustive search.  
4. To validate the framework on realistic LLM fine-tuning tasks, demonstrating significant reductions in search cost and energy consumption.  

Significance  
By integrating optimizer dynamics into scaling laws, this work will:  
- Dramatically reduce the hyperparameter search budget for large model training.  
- Lower time-to-train and total energy consumption, mitigating environmental impact.  
- Provide theoretical insight into how optimization interacts with model scale and data scale.  
- Offer a practical tool for researchers and practitioners to fine-tune large models efficiently.  

2. Methodology  
Our methodology consists of two main phases: (A) data collection and scaling-law derivation, and (B) framework design and experimental validation.  

A. Data Collection and Scaling-Law Derivation  

1. Experimental Grid Design  
   a. Model Sizes $N_i$: We select a set $\{10^7,10^8,10^9,10^{10}\}$ parameters, instantiated as transformer language models of increasing depth and width.  
   b. Dataset Sizes $D_j$: We sample subsets of a large corpus (e.g., OpenWebText) at scales $\{10^6,10^7,10^8\}$ tokens.  
   c. Optimizers $O_k$: We include AdamW, SGD with momentum, and RMSprop.  
   d. Hyperparameters $h_l$: For each $(N_i,D_j,O_k)$, we vary  
      - Learning rate $\eta\in[\eta_{\min},\eta_{\max}]$ on a log grid,  
      - Batch size $B\in\{256,512,1024,2048\}$,  
      - Momentum $m\in[0.0,0.99]$ (where applicable),  
      - Weight decay $w\in\{0,10^{-4},10^{-3},10^{-2}\}$.  

2. Trial Training  
   For each tuple $(i,j,k,l)$, train the model for a fixed budget of $T$ gradient steps, where $T$ is scaled so that total compute (FLOPs) is roughly constant across trials. Record final training loss $L_{ijkl}$, validation loss $L^{(\mathrm{val})}_{ijkl}$, training time $t_{ijkl}$, and energy usage $e_{ijkl}$.  

3. Optimal Hyperparameter Identification  
   For each $(i,j,k)$, identify the optimal hyperparameter set  
   $$h^*_{ijk} = \arg\min_{l}\;L^{(\mathrm{val})}_{ijkl}$$  
   and collect $\eta^*_{ijk}, B^*_{ijk}, m^*_{ijk}, w^*_{ijk}$.  

4. Fitting Scaling Laws  
   Using the collected $(N_i,D_j,h^*_{ijk})$ data, fit models of the form  
   (1) Learning rate:  
     $$\eta^*(N,D,O) = \alpha_O\, N^{-\gamma_O} D^{-\delta_O},$$  
   (2) Batch size:  
     $$B^*(N,D,O) = \beta_O\,D^{\epsilon_O},$$  
   (3) Momentum:  
     $$m^*(N,D,O) = 1 - \zeta_O\,N^{-\kappa_O},$$  
   (4) Weight decay:  
     $$w^*(N,D,O) = \lambda_O\,N^{-\mu_O}.$$  
   We perform a log-linear least squares regression for each optimizer $O$, minimizing  
   $$\min_{\alpha_O,\gamma_O,\delta_O}\sum_{i,j}\Bigl(\log\eta^*_{ijO}-\log\bigl(\alpha_O N_i^{-\gamma_O}D_j^{-\delta_O}\bigr)\Bigr)^2$$  
   and analogous objectives for $B^*,m^*,w^*$. Statistical significance and goodness-of-fit are assessed via $R^2$ and residual analysis.  

B. Framework Design and Experimental Validation  

1. Hyperparameter Recommendation Module  
   We implement a light Python package that:  
   a. Takes as input desired model size $N^*$, data size $D^*$, and chosen optimizer $O^*$.  
   b. Computes predicted hyperparameters  
      $$\widehat\eta = \alpha_{O^*}(N^*)^{-\gamma_{O^*}}(D^*)^{-\delta_{O^*}},\quad \widehat B = \beta_{O^*}(D^*)^{\epsilon_{O^*}},\ldots$$  
   c. Outputs a suggested configuration set $\{\widehat\eta,\widehat B,\widehat m,\widehat w\}$.  

2. Validation on Unseen Scales and Tasks  
   a. Fine-tuning Benchmarks: We select downstream tasks (e.g., classification on GLUE, summarization on XSum) and a held-out model size (e.g., $N^*=2\times10^9$).  
   b. Baseline Methods:  
      - Random search limited to 20 trials,  
      - CARBS (Fetterman et al., 2023),  
      - Heuristic extrapolation from  smaller-model runs.  
   c. Evaluation Metrics:  
      - Validation loss gap $\Delta L = L(\widehat h)-L(h_{\rm opt})$,  
      - Time-to-target: number of steps to reach $L_{\rm opt}+ \epsilon$,  
      - Compute savings: relative reduction in total FLOPs,  
      - Energy savings: relative reduction in kWh and CO₂e.  

3. Experimental Protocol  
   For each downstream task and baseline:  
   1. Use baseline to search $(\eta,B,m,w)$ until budget exhaustion or convergence. Record best loss $L_{\rm base}$ and cost $C_{\rm base}$.  
   2. Use our framework’s prediction $\widehat h$ to train one model, record $L_{\rm ours}$ and cost $C_{\rm ours}$.  
   3. Compute relative performance $\frac{L_{\rm ours}-L(h_{\rm opt})}{L(h_{\rm opt})}$ and cost ratio $\frac{C_{\rm ours}}{C_{\rm base}}$.  
   Statistical tests (paired t-test) assess whether our method significantly outperforms baselines in cost and loss. Plots of cost vs. performance help visualize Pareto improvements.  

Evaluation Metrics Summary  
– Loss gap: $(L_{\rm ours}-L_{\rm opt})/L_{\rm opt}$  
– Relative compute: $C_{\rm ours}/C_{\rm base}$  
– Energy reduction: $(e_{\rm base}-e_{\rm ours})/e_{\rm base}$  
– Search trials saved: Trials$_{\rm base}-$Trials$_{\rm ours}$

4. Conclusion & Future Work  
This proposal addresses a pressing need in large model optimization by explicitly incorporating optimizer hyperparameters into scaling laws. Our empirical and theoretical contributions promise to transform how practitioners tune models at scale, yielding both practical tools and deeper understanding. Future extensions include:  
– Extending the framework to additional optimizers (e.g., LAMB, AdaFactor) and regularization strategies (dropout rates).  
– Incorporating second-order information to refine scaling exponents.  
– Exploring dynamic scaling laws that adapt during training (e.g., learning rate dropout schedules).  
– Integrating the tool into popular AutoML and training frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch Lightning).  

By bridging classical optimization methodology with the challenges of scaling laws, this work lays the foundation for more efficient, sustainable, and accessible large-scale machine learning.
