1. **Title**: Neural Optimal Transport via Unified Discrete-Continuous Learning  

2. **Motivation**: Optimal transport (OT) is a cornerstone for comparing distributions in ML, but computational complexity—especially in high-dimensional or large-scale settings—remains a bottleneck. Existing solvers struggle with scalability and sample efficiency, hindering real-world applicability. A unified, efficient framework that bridges discrete and continuous OT formulations could democratize OT in big-data domains like genomics and NLP.  

3. **Main Idea**: We propose learning **neural OT solvers** by integrating:  
- **Hybrid architectures**: Train neural networks to approximate Monge maps and couplings *simultaneously* for both discrete (empirical) and continuous (density-based) distributions.  
- **Adversarial regularization**: Stabilize training via dual formulations of OT, ensuring compatibility with Wasserstein gradient flows and unbalanced OT extensions.  
- **Theoretical guarantees**: Derive finite-sample convergence bounds for the solvers using entropy-regularized OT as a proxy, enabling rigorous complexity analysis.  
This approach aims to reduce runtime complexity from *O(n³)* to *O(n)* for large *n* while preserving statistical accuracy, enabling real-time OT applications in generative modeling and domain adaptation. Impact includes scalable analysis of single-cell RNA-seq datasets and improved training dynamics in Wasserstein GANs.
