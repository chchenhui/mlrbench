# VeriMem – A Veriacity-Driven Memory Architecture for LLM Agents

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background  
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities as autonomous agents, capable of long-term interactions via persistent memory systems. However, these models often propagate hallucinations—confidently generated false statements—or amplify biases when recalling unverified historical interactions. This is particularly problematic in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal systems, where trustworthiness is paramount. Existing memory architectures, such as A-MEM and Rowen, focus on adaptability and semantic coherence but lack veracity-aware mechanisms to filter unreliable information during recall. 

Hallucinations arise due to (1) the opacity of training data, (2) the generative nature of LLMs encouraging confabulation, and (3) unregulated information retrieval from unconstrained memory stores. Meanwhile, social biases embedded in LLMs persist because memory systems rarely reassess the validity of stored data. This gap motivates VeriMem, a novel memory architecture that injects **veracity awareness** into both storage and retrieval processes.

### 1.2 Research Objectives  
VeriMem aims to address three challenges identified in the literature:
1. **Veracity Scoring**: Assign and update veracity scores to memory entries using lightweight fact-checking against trusted external sources.
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Implement task-specific thresholds to dynamically filter unreliable memories without sacrificing adaptability.
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Detect low-confidence recalls via entropy-based estimation, prompting human or external validation.

### 1.3 Significance  
By mitigating hallucinations and bias amplification, VeriMem enhances the **safety and trustworthiness** of LLM agents in high-risk deployments. Its modular design allows integration with existing frameworks (e.g., ReAct), making it a practical solution for real-world applications like automated diagnostic assistants or financial advisory systems.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 System Overview  
VeriMem augments standard memory modules (Figure 1) with (1) **veracity scoring**, (2) **dynamic thresholding**, and (3) **uncertainty-aware subroutines**. It operates in three stages:

1. **Writing**: New memories receive an initial veracity score $V \in [0,1]$.
2. **Maintenance**: Scores decay over time and are updated via periodic fact-checking.
3. **Retrieval**: Memories with $V < \tau$ (dynamic threshold) trigger re-validation or external lookups.

### 2.2 Veracity Scoring Mechanism  
#### 2.2.1 Initial Scoring  
Each memory $m_t$ received at time $t$ is scored using:  
$$
V(m_t) = \alpha S(m_t) + \beta C(m_t) + \gamma T(m_t)
$$
where:  
- $S(m_t)$: Source credibility (0–1) quantified via reputation scores of the origin (e.g., domain-specific knowledge bases).  
- $C(m_t)$: Content consistency with existing high-veracity memories, computed using cosine similarity between embedding vectors:  
$$
C(m_t) = \frac{\sum_{m_i \in H} \text{sim}(m_t, m_i)}{|H|}
$$
where $H$ is the set of memories with $V > \tau_{\text{crit}}$ (critical trust threshold).  
- $T(m_t)$: Temporal decay factor $T(m_t) = e^{-\lambda (t - t_0)}$, where $\lambda$ (decay rate) balances adaptability and trustworthiness.  
- $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$: Normalized weights ($\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1$) tuned via grid search.  

#### 2.2.2 Periodic Updates  
Veracities are refreshed using external knowledge. For each $m \in M$ (memory bank), trigger fact-checking if:
$$
M_t(q_m) > \theta \cdot V(m)
$$
where $M_t(q_m)$ is the inverse document frequency of query $q_m$ (to prioritize questions with rare terms) and $\theta$ is a sensitivity hyperparameter.

Fact-checking leverages APIs (e.g., News API, biomedical databases) to verify $m$ and compute a new $V'$:
$$
V'(m) = \kappa \cdot V(m) + (1 - \kappa) \cdot F_q(m)
$$
where $F_q(m) \in [0,1]$ is the fact-check result ($0$: contradict, $0.5$: neutral, $1$: confirm) and $\kappa < 1$ discounts previous confidence.

### 2.3 Dynamic Thresholding for Retrieval  
The veracity threshold $\tau$ adapts to task criticality:
$$
\tau = \tau_{\text{base}} \cdot \begin{cases}
1 + \delta_\text{high}, & \text{if } T_c = \text{high-risk} \\
1 + \delta_\text{med}, & \text{if } T_c = \text{medium-risk} \\
1 - \delta_\text{low}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
where $T_c$ is task criticality and $0 < \delta_{\text{low}} < \delta_{\text{med}} < \delta_{\text{high}} < 1$ are empirically determined trade-offs between safety and recall coverage.

During retrieval, $m^* = \arg\max_{m \in R} V(m)$ if $V(m) \geq \tau$; otherwise, trigger on-the-fly lookup via $q_{\text{lookup}} = \omega(m^*)$, where $\omega$ maps the low-veracity memory to a precise search query.

### 2.4 Uncertainty Estimation Subroutines  
For each retrieved $m^*$, VeriMem estimates recall confidence using the entropy of token probabilities $p_{\theta}(x)$ from the host LLM:
$$
H(m^*) = -\sum_{k=1}^{K} p_{\theta}(x_k | \text{context}) \log p_{\theta}(x_k | \text{context})
$$
If $H(m^*) > \xi$ (uncertainty threshold), activate fallback actions:
- **AI validation**: Generate multiple reasoning paths and validate against knowledge bases.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Flag entries for expert review via UI alerts.

### 2.5 Experimental Design  
#### 2.5.1 Datasets  
1. **Dialogue History**: MT Bench and RedPajamas (for conversational hallucinations).  
2. **Code Debugging**: CodeX Gloucester and HumanEval (for logic errors).  
3. **Bias Amplification**: TruthfulQA (extracted factual vs. false queries) and NewsQA.  

#### 2.5.2 Baselines  
- **ReAct (Baseline)**: Standard chain-of-thought agent.  
- **A-MEM**: State-of-the-art memory organization.  
- **Rowen**: Adaptive retrieval augmentation for hallucination mitigation.  
- **VeriMem-w/o-τ (Ablation)**: VeriMem without dynamic thresholds.
