1. **Title**: **Emergent Collusion Mitigation in Multi-Agent Systems via Adversarial Co-Training and Game-Theoretic Accountability**  

2. **Motivation**: Multi-agent systems increasingly operate in high-stakes environments (e.g., finance, autonomous infrastructure), yet emergent collusion or correlated failures between agents pose systemic risks that are poorly understood and inadequately addressed. Existing safety research focuses on single-agent robustness, leaving a critical gap in ensuring group-level trustworthiness.  

3. **Main Idea**: Propose a framework combining **adversarial co-training** and **game-theoretic accountability mechanisms** to detect and prevent unintended emergent behaviors. Agents will be trained in a competitive-cooperative environment where adversaries simulate collusion scenarios (e.g., resource hoarding, misinformation sharing), while defenders learn to identify and disrupt harmful coordination patterns using interpretable reward shaping. A novel **collusion taxonomy** will be developed to categorize emergent threats, paired with a benchmark suite (e.g., multi-agent reinforcement learning environments with adversarial evaluators). Expected outcomes include: (1) a set of open-source tools for auditing multi-agent interactions, (2) game-theoretic metrics to quantify collusion risk, and (3) policy-aware training protocols that enforce accountability via incentive alignment. This work could reduce systemic risks in critical AI-driven infrastructures by enabling proactive governance of emergent group dynamics.
