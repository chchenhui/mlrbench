**Title:** Symbolic-Augmented Foundation Models for Hallucination-Free Scientific Discovery  

**Motivation:**  
Scientific foundation models risk generating hallucinations (factually incorrect outputs), which can derail research and erode trust. Ensuring alignment with established scientific facts is critical for reliable applications in domains like drug discovery or quantum mechanics, where accuracy is non-negotiable. Current methods, such as fine-tuning on domain data, often fail to encode rigorous physical laws or logical constraints.  

**Main Idea:**  
Develop hybrid foundation models that integrate neural networks with symbolic reasoning engines to enforce adherence to scientific principles. During training, incorporate symbolic constraints (e.g., conservation laws, differential equations) directly into the loss function, penalizing violations. At inference, use a two-step process: the foundation model generates hypotheses, and a symbolic module validates outputs against domain-specific knowledge graphs or equations, iteratively refining them. For example, in materials science, the model could propose candidate molecules, which are then checked for thermodynamic feasibility via embedded solvers.  

**Expected Outcomes & Impact:**  
This approach aims to reduce hallucinations while preserving the modelâ€™s adaptability. Outcomes include improved accuracy in tasks like hypothesis generation and experimental design. Potential impact includes accelerated discovery in fields like biomedicine, where trust in AI-generated hypotheses is essential for real-world adoption. The framework could also generalize across scientific domains, bridging data-driven and first-principles approaches.
