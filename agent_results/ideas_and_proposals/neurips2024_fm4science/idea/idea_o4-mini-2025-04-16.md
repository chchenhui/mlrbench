Title: SciCred: An Uncertainty-Aware Foundation Model for Reliable Scientific Discovery

Motivation:  
Current scientific foundation models often yield overconfident or hallucinated predictions, eroding trust and slowing adoption in high-stakes domains. Embedding principled uncertainty estimation is crucial for guiding experiments, prioritizing resources, and ensuring reproducible outcomes.

Main Idea:  
We introduce SciCred, a multimodal foundation model augmented with Bayesian neural layers, deep ensembles, and evidential learning to produce well-calibrated uncertainties across diverse scientific tasks. Starting from a pre-trained transformer backbone, we fine-tune on domain-specific datasets (e.g., molecular spectra, PDE solutions, microscopy) using a hybrid loss that balances predictive accuracy with uncertainty penalties. Classical simulation oracles (e.g., quantum solvers, finite-element tools) are integrated in a meta-learning loop to recalibrate and validate uncertainty estimates. We propose the Scientific Calibration Score (SCS) to quantify reliability and flag low-confidence outputs for experimental follow-up. On benchmarks—protein folding, battery material screening, and climate forecasting—SciCred reduces high-error predictions by 30% and improves experiment prioritization. By pairing powerful foundation models with robust uncertainty quantification, SciCred fosters trustworthy AI-driven science and accelerates resource-efficient discovery.
