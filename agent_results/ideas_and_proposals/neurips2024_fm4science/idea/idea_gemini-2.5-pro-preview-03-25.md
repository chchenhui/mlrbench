**Title:** Fact-Aligned Scientific Foundation Models via Knowledge-Infused Fine-tuning

**Motivation:** Standard foundation models, often trained on general web data, can generate scientifically implausible "hallucinations" inconsistent with established physical laws or empirical facts. This lack of factual grounding hinders their reliable application in scientific domains where accuracy and adherence to known principles are paramount.

**Main Idea:** We propose a fine-tuning methodology that explicitly aligns pre-trained foundation models with verified scientific knowledge. This involves curating domain-specific datasets comprising scientific facts, principles, and experimental results (e.g., physical equations, chemical reaction rules, validated biological pathways). We will develop a novel fine-tuning objective that combines standard task-specific loss with a knowledge consistency loss. This auxiliary loss penalizes outputs contradicting the curated knowledge base (potentially represented as knowledge graphs or logical rules). The expected outcome is a foundation model that retains its broad capabilities while generating outputs demonstrably consistent with scientific facts, reducing hallucinations and increasing trustworthiness for applications like hypothesis generation or data interpretation in science.
