# Scientific Foundation Model Uncertainty Quantification: A Bayesian Approach

## Motivation
As foundation models become increasingly integrated into scientific research, quantifying their uncertainty is critical. Scientists need to know not just what these models predict, but how confident these predictions are, especially for high-stakes scientific applications where errors could have serious consequences. Current foundation models excel at producing answers but often fail to provide reliable uncertainty estimates, leading to potentially misleading conclusions when applied to scientific problems that require rigorous validation.

## Main Idea
I propose developing a Bayesian framework specifically designed for quantifying uncertainty in scientific foundation models. The approach combines Bayesian neural networks with domain-specific scientific constraints to generate credible intervals for model predictions. The methodology involves: (1) implementing variational inference techniques that scale to large foundation models; (2) incorporating scientific laws and domain knowledge as Bayesian priors; (3) developing calibration metrics specifically for scientific applications; and (4) creating uncertainty visualization tools that scientists without ML expertise can interpret. The expected outcome is a framework that provides reliable uncertainty quantification across multiple scientific domains, enabling researchers to appropriately weight model predictions in their work and identify areas where models require improvement. This research would bridge the gap between the powerful capabilities of foundation models and the rigorous uncertainty quantification required in scientific discovery.
