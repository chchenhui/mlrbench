### Introduction

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into scientific research marks a paradigm shift in the landscape of modern discovery. Traditionally, scientific inquiry has been guided by a rigorous methodology predicated on hypothesis testing, experimentation, and observation. However, the advent of AI and ML presents a unique opportunity to reimagine this process, leveraging data-driven approaches to model complex phenomena across disciplines. Among the most promising advancements are foundation models, large-scale pre-trained systems that demonstrate remarkable versatility across tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and now, increasingly, scientific domains. These models, such as GPT-4 and CLIP, offer the potential to extract patterns and insights from diverse and multifaceted scientific datasets, transforming how interdisciplinary research is conducted and accelerating discovery. Yet, as the workshop emphasizes, this synergy also introduces critical challenges, particularly in the realm of uncertainty quantification—a cornerstone of scientific rigor that distinguishes exploratory predictions from actionable conclusions.

While foundation models excel at generating robust predictions, one of their primary limitations in scientific contexts is their inability to provide reliable measures of uncertainty. Scientific endeavors frequently hinge on precision and reproducibility, necessitating models that not only predict outcomes but also convey the confidence or reliability associated with these predictions. This is especially vital in mission-critical scenarios (e.g., virtual screening for drug discovery, forecasting climate change impacts), where erroneous conclusions derived from overconfident or misaligned predictions could have far-reaching and even irreversible consequences. Current foundation models, trained predominantly for tasks in non-scientific domains, are ill-equipped to handle this dual requirement. Furthermore, as these models are scaled to higher complexities—often to accommodate the demands of scientific discovery—their uncertainty estimates become increasingly opaque and harder to validate across scenarios.

In response to these challenges, this proposal centers on developing a Bayesian framework to quantify uncertainty in scientific foundation models. The core idea is rooted in Bayesian neural networks, which provide a natural probabilistic structure for capturing epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. By introducing innovations in variational inference and domain-specific priors, the proposed approach will address the scalability limitations inherent in traditional methods while ensuring that the foundational constraints of specific scientific fields, such as conservation laws in physics or synthesis rules in chemistry, are integrated into the model architecture. These priors are intended to regularize the model, guiding its predictions within the bounds of established scientific principles and reducing the likelihood of hallucinatory outputs. Additionally, the framework will introduce novel calibration metrics tailored to scientific applications, enabling the evaluation of whether predicted confidence intervals align with empirical observations.

The anticipated outcome of this research is a comprehensive Bayesian framework that enhances the transparency and reliability of scientific foundation models. This framework will be validated across a variety of scenarios in domains like earth science and quantum mechanics to demonstrate its adaptability and accuracy. Crucially, it will address the workshop’s key questions related to the reusability and generalizability of foundation models in different scientific contexts. By equipping these models with credible uncertainty estimation, we aim to facilitate the responsible deployment of AI in high-stakes settings, ensuring that researchers can weigh the utility of model predictions appropriately while identifying regions of predictive instability requiring further refinement. This work directly supports the broader vision of integrating foundation models into the scientific workflow, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and ultimately enabling a transformative leap in problem-solving capabilities across fields constrained by incomplete or noisy data.

### Methodology - Bayesian Framework for Uncertainty Quantification  

The proposed Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification in scientific foundation models builds upon recent advancements in probabilistic deep learning and scalable Bayesian inference techniques. At its core, this framework integrates Bayesian neural networks with domain-specific science-driven constraints, aiming to produce calibrated credible intervals that reflect both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Epistemic uncertainty, arising from model ambiguity and data insufficiency, can be reduced through additional data, while aleatoric uncertainty, stemming from inherent data noise, is irreducible. This distinction is crucial in scientific applications, where identifying the source of uncertainty informs whether further experimentation or improved data collection is required to enhance predictive reliability.  

To implement this framework, we will employ variational inference (VI), a scalable approximation method for Bayesian learning that enables uncertainty estimation in deep neural networks. VI introduces a parameterized approximation $ q(\theta | D) $ to the true posterior distribution $ p(\theta | D) $, where $ \theta $ represents the model weights and $ D $ the observed dataset. The objective is to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between $ q(\theta | D) $ and $ p(\theta | D) $, which leads to the variational loss function:  

$$ L_{VI}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{q(\theta | \phi)} \left[ -\log p(D | \theta) \right] + \text{KL}(q(\theta | \phi) \| p(\theta)) $$  

Here, $ \phi $ denotes the variational parameters that define $ q(\theta | \phi) $, and $ p(\theta) $ represents the prior distribution over model parameters. In standard deep learning, deterministic weights are used, but in the Bayesian framework, we instead maintain a distribution over weights, allowing the model to capture uncertainty through probabilistic reasoning. To ensure tractability in large-scale foundation models, we will incorporate techniques from recent scalable variational inference studies, such as sparse variational posterior approximations and distributed training strategies, which have demonstrated feasibility in high-dimensional scientific problems.  

Beyond conventional Bayesian neural networks, our approach introduces domain-specific scientific constraints through custom prior distributions. While traditional priors in Bayesian machine learning are often generic (e.g., Gaussian priors), integrating domain knowledge requires structured priors that encode physical laws, conservation principles, and known scientific relationships. For instance, in a physics-based model predicting material properties, prior distributions can enforce energy conservation and stability conditions, ensuring that uncertainty estimates are scientifically grounded. One formulation that can be adapted from literature is the Gaussian process (GP) prior:  

$$ p(\theta) = \mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x, x')) $$  

Where $ m(x) $ is the mean function and $ k(x, x') $ is the covariance kernel tailored to specific scientific constraints. This formulation allows for uncertainty quantification that respects the underlying physics of the problem while leveraging the flexibility of foundation models for complex scientific tasks.  

To evaluate the reliability of uncertainty estimates, we will introduce calibration metrics designed explicitly for scientific applications. Calibration measures how well predicted confidence intervals align with empirical frequencies of ground truth values. Unlike in standard deep learning, where calibration techniques such as temperature scaling are applied post-hoc, scientific calibration requires domain-aware adjustments. Drawing from recent literature on calibration metrics, we will employ metrics such as the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and the Interval Coverage Deviation (ICD) to assess the accuracy of predicted credible intervals. These metrics will be extended to incorporate scientific constraints, ensuring that uncertainty quantification is both statistically consistent and semantically meaningful.  

Interpretability remains a challenge when integrating uncertainty quantification into scientific practice. Scientists without extensive knowledge of machine learning should be able to understand and leverage uncertainty estimates effectively. To address this, we will develop uncertainty visualization tools that translate Bayesian credible intervals into domain-specific graphical interpretations. These tools will build upon existing work in visualization for uncertainty quantification, such as interactive uncertainty plots and sensitivity maps that highlight influential input features. However, we will adapt them for foundation models by incorporating model decomposition techniques, allowing domain experts to distinguish between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in model predictions. Additionally, we will introduce user-friendly dashboards that summarize calibration performance across different scientific tasks, enabling seamless integration into existing research workflows.  

By combining scalable variational inference, domain-constrained priors, calibrated uncertainty metrics, and interpretable visualization techniques, the proposed Bayesian framework aims to bridge the gap between the power of foundation models and the rigorous uncertainty estimation required in scientific discovery. The approach aligns with recent advances in uncertainty quantification for scientific machine learning, building upon methods such as the Information Bottleneck-based uncertainty quantification (IB-UQ) and probabilistic neural differential equations frameworks like NeuralUQ. However, unlike these approaches, which often target smaller domain-specific models, our framework focuses on adapting Bayesian uncertainty estimation to large-scale foundation models, ensuring both scalability and generalization across multi-modal scientific applications.

### Methodology - Experimental Design and Validation Strategies  

To validate the proposed Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification, we will design a comprehensive experimental methodology covering data collection, model training, and evaluation strategies. Our experiments will involve diverse scientific domains—such as material science, climate modeling, and biomedical engineering—to ensure the framework’s generalizability across applications requiring different data modalities and uncertainty characteristics. These domains were chosen due to their distinct scientific constraints, data variability, and high-stakes decision-making requirements, making them ideal for assessing the framework’s effectiveness.  

For data collection, we will leverage publicly available scientific datasets and collaborate with domain experts to curate domain-specific inputs where necessary. For example, in material science applications, we will use crystal structure databases like the Materials Project and the Crystallography Open Database to train and evaluate the model’s ability to predict properties with associated uncertainties. In climate modeling, we will utilize datasets from NASA's Earth Observing System, including satellite-derived temperature and atmospheric composition records. Additionally, we will incorporate datasets with varying noise levels to evaluate the framework’s robustness and its ability to distinguish between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, a key challenge identified in previous research.  

The model training phase will employ Bayesian variational inference, with our framework implemented atop established foundation models such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) for image-based scientific data, large language models (LLMs) for text-based and symbolic reasoning tasks, and scientific deep learning models like PINNs and DeepONets for physics-informed predictions. To ensure scalability across these architectures, we will utilize approximate inference methods such as stochastic variational inference and sparse variational Gaussian approximations, techniques that have demonstrated feasibility in recent studies on scalable Bayesian neural networks. We will assess different prior settings, ranging from weakly informative Gaussian priors to structured priors encoding physical constraints, to determine how prior knowledge affects both predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration.  

Our evaluation will focus on three primary metrics: predictive accuracy, uncertainty calibration, and interpretability. For predictive accuracy, standard regression metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) will be used. Additionally, we will compute the negative log-likelihood (NLL):  

$$ \text{NLL} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \log p(y_i | x_i, \theta) $$  

Where $ y_i $ is the true output, $ x_i $ is the input data, and $ p(y_i | x_i, \theta) $ is the predicted likelihood from the probabilistic model. This metric evaluates the model’s ability to capture uncertainty within its predictions rather than just producing deterministic outputs. For calibration, we will employ the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS):  

$$ \text{CRPS}(F, y) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( F(y_i) - \chi(y_i < y_{\text{true}}) \right)^2 $$  

Where $ F $ is the model’s predicted cumulative distribution function (CDF), $ y $ is a reference output, and $ \chi $ is the indicator function. Additionally, we will compute the Interval Coverage Deviation (ICD), which measures the deviation of the model’s confidence intervals from the theoretically expected coverage probabilities. These metrics, adapted from recent studies on uncertainty calibration, will allow us to evaluate how well our framework aligns with both statistical and scientific expectations.  

Interpretability assessments will involve user studies with domain scientists to determine how well the uncertainty visualization tools convey meaningful information. We will develop interactive dashboards capable of displaying calibration plots, uncertainty intervals, and sensitivity analyses derived from the Bayesian posterior distribution. To measure usability, we will conduct experiments with researchers across different scientific domains, assessing how confidently they can interpret model predictions in high-stakes decision-making scenarios.  

Our approach will also incorporate cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to ensure robustness across different applications. We will leverage scientific computing frameworks such as NeuralUQ and Probabilistic Neural Operators to benchmark our framework against existing uncertainty estimation techniques, including dropout-based inference and ensemble methods. This will allow us to determine whether a Bayesian approach offers advantages in both predictive reliability and uncertainty calibration, particularly for complex, high-dimensional scientific problems where traditional methods often fall short.  

By rigorously testing our framework across multiple domains and comparing it with established uncertainty estimation techniques, we aim to demonstrate its effectiveness in addressing the key challenges identified in scientific foundation models. These include scalability to large architectures, integration of domain knowledge into uncertainty estimation, and the provision of interpretable uncertainty quantification for researchers without formal ML expertise.

### Expected Outcomes  

The successful development and implementation of this Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification in scientific foundation models will yield several impactful advancements. First and foremost, it will establish a scalable methodology for training large foundation models with calibrated uncertainty estimation capabilities, overcoming the challenges of computational efficiency and generalization. By adapting variational inference techniques with structured domain-informed priors, the framework will ensure uncertainty estimates remain reliable across different scientific tasks while maintaining predictive performance. This contribution addresses a major gap in existing foundation models, which often produce powerful but uncalibrated predictions that do not quantify their associated credibility effectively.  

One of the key advancements anticipated is the ability to generate domain-specific credible intervals while preserving model flexibility across multi-modal inputs. Unlike standard uncertainty quantification methods that treat uncertainty as a uniform statistical phenomenon, our approach integrates scientific constraints through priors that guide the uncertainty estimates within physically valid ranges. This ensures that when foundation models are applied to complex scientific data—spanning partial differential equations (PDEs), molecular structure prediction, or climate forecasting—the resulting uncertainty quantification is not only statistically sound but also semantically meaningful. This aligns with recent work in probabilistic neural networks that emphasize structured priors for physics-aware modeling while ensuring uncertainty propagation remains transparent.  

Additionally, the Bayesian framework will introduce adaptive calibration metrics tailored for scientific applications, providing domain experts with interpretable tools for assessing the reliability of foundation model predictions. Existing calibration metrics, such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE), perform well in conventional machine learning but are insufficient for scientific regression and operator learning tasks where uncertainty manifests in continuous distributions and dynamic system states. Our calibration approach builds upon the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and Interval Coverage Deviation (ICD), refining them to accommodate scientific laws and constraints. This enhancement makes the uncertainty metrics more applicable to problems like chemical reaction rate prediction and stochastic PDE forecasting, where miscalibrated confidence intervals can lead to erroneous scientific conclusions.  

The proposed framework will also advance the interpretability of uncertainty for scientists without formal machine learning expertise. By designing visualization tools that present credible intervals and calibration diagnostics in an intuitive manner, researchers will be able to better understand model predictions and identify cases where uncertainty should prompt further experimental validation. Drawing from recent advancements in uncertainty visualization in scientific contexts, our tools will decompose uncertainty sources, distinguishing between aleatoric and epistemic contributions, allowing scientists to determine whether predictive instability stems from inherent data limitations or model bias. This capability is especially critical in research areas such as biomedical AI, where overconfidence in predictions could mislead drug discovery pipelines or impact clinical decision-making.  

Furthermore, the framework will contribute to the broader foundation model community by offering a structured approach to integrating Bayesian uncertainty estimation into large-scale models. The methodology will provide guidelines for incorporating domain knowledge into both weight priors and uncertainty bounds, fostering discussions on the role of probabilistic deep learning in scientific applications. These advancements will enable more robust deployment of foundation models in high-stakes scientific discovery environments, ensuring that predictions are not only accurate but also appropriately bounded given the available data and domain constraints.

### Projected Impact and Future Research Directions  

The proposed Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification in scientific foundation models will significantly enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of AI-driven scientific discovery. By providing calibrated credible intervals for model predictions, researchers will gain a clearer understanding of the confidence they can place in AI-generated insights, particularly in high-stakes applications where errors can be costly. This advancement will allow for the responsible deployment of foundation models in domains such as biomedical research, climate forecasting, and materials discovery, where probabilistic reasoning and rigorous validation are crucial. Additionally, the ability to distinguish between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties will empower domain scientists to identify scenarios that require additional data collection versus those that reflect inherent modeling limitations, refining the iterative cycle of AI-assisted discovery and experimental validation.  

Beyond individual models, this research will promote collaboration between classical scientific methods and foundation models by ensuring that uncertainty estimates align with empirically observed and theoretically constrained phenomena. Traditional computational approaches, such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and reduced-order modeling, often provide deterministic but well-defined error bounds based on numerical analysis. In contrast, AI models trained purely on empirical data lack such interpretability, leading to challenges in model integration. The Bayesian framework will bridge this gap by incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the model’s uncertainty constraints, enabling foundation models to complement well-established numerical and computational methods rather than replace them. This harmonization is particularly valuable for hybrid AI-human workflows in scientific research, where models can be used not only for prediction but also for guiding uncertainty-aware experimental design.  

The methodologies and tools developed in this research will have broad cross-disciplinary benefits, extending beyond individual domain applications. The Bayesian formulation will provide a unified framework for uncertainty estimation, ensuring that diverse scientific disciplines—including computational chemistry, quantum mechanics, and climate science—can adopt a standardized approach to evaluating AI reliability. Additionally, the uncertainty visualization tools and calibration metrics will be made publicly available, allowing researchers to apply them to their own scientific models without requiring extensive machine learning expertise. This accessibility will lower the barrier for AI adoption in traditional scientific fields, facilitating a more seamless integration of foundation models into the broader research ecosystem.  

Furthermore, by addressing key theoretical challenges in applying Bayesian inference to large-scale foundation models, this work will open new research directions in probabilistic deep learning and foundation model robustness. The framework’s ability to scale to high-dimensional scientific problems will inform future studies on uncertainty-aware architectures that maintain performance while providing interpretable probabilistic guarantees. Additionally, its incorporation of domain-specific constraints into Bayesian priors may inspire novel approaches for structured uncertainty estimation across disciplines, ensuring that models remain aligned with scientific principles even as they evolve with new data. The insights gained from this study will also contribute to foundation model governance frameworks, guiding the responsible application of scalable AI in scientific research. In sum, this research will lay the groundwork for a new generation of foundation models that not only yield high-performance predictions but also offer rigorous, interpretable, and scientifically grounded uncertainty assessments.
