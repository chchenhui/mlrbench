Title: Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Scientific Foundation Models

1. Introduction  
Background  
The advent of large-scale foundation models in natural language processing (e.g., GPT-4) and vision (e.g., CLIP) has revolutionized multiple domains by providing versatile pre-trained representations that can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks. In parallel, AI‐for‐Science (AI4Science) and Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) have shown that machine learning methods can accelerate discovery in physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, and Earth science by modeling complex phenomena such as protein folding, quantum mechanics, and partial differential equations. However, a critical gap remains: scientific applications demand rigorous estimates of predictive uncertainty to guide experimental design, ensure safety in high‐stakes decisions, and quantify confidence in novel discoveries.  

Current foundation models excel at producing point predictions but often lack reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ). Without trustworthy UQ, model outputs risk misleading scientists, particularly when extrapolating beyond training distributions or integrating domain constraints. Recent works such as IB-UQ (Guo et al., 2023), statistical UQ frameworks (van Leeuwen et al., 2024), NeuralUQ (Zou et al., 2022), and specialized calibration metrics (Davis & Brown, 2024) have addressed aspects of UQ in SciML. Yet, no unified Bayesian framework has been developed that scales to foundation-scale models, incorporates domain knowledge as informative priors, and produces calibrated, interpretable uncertainty estimates across multiple scientific domains.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop and evaluate a Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification Framework (BUQF) tailored for scientific foundation models. The main objectives are:  
1. To design a scalable variational inference method for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) that can be applied to foundation-scale models.  
2. To integrate domain‐specific scientific laws and empirical constraints into the Bayesian prior, enhancing both predictive performance and UQ fidelity.  
3. To develop calibration metrics and diagnostic tools that assess the reliability of UQ in scientific settings.  
4. To implement user-friendly visualization interfaces enabling domain scientists to interpret credible intervals and uncertainty decompositions.  

Significance  
BUQF will bridge the gap between the power of foundation models and the stringent UQ requirements of scientific discovery. By providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, the framework will:  
– Increase trust and adoption of AI4Science tools among domain experts.  
– Guide experimental design by highlighting high-uncertainty regimes where additional data collection is most valuable.  
– Prevent costly or dangerous misinterpretations in high-stakes applications (e.g., drug design, materials prediction).  
– Foster interdisciplinary collaboration by packaging UQ in accessible forms.  

2. Methodology  
Our methodology comprises four components: model formulation, variational inference, prior integration, and evaluation & visualization.  

2.1 Data Collection and Benchmark Selection  
To ensure broad applicability, BUQF will be evaluated on representative science benchmarks across three domains:  
– Quantum chemistry: QM9 dataset of small organic molecules (∼ 134k molecules, computed quantum properties).  
– Materials science: Battery Material dataset with computed formation energies and electrochemical properties.  
– Computational physics: Navier–Stokes PDE solver dataset (turbulent flow fields).  

Additionally, we will demonstrate multi-modal capability by including a biomedicine dataset (protein fold classification from sequence and structural features). For each dataset, we split into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%), ensuring coverage of in-distribution and out-of-distribution regimes via scaffold splits (for molecules) and varying Reynolds numbers (for fluid flows).  

2.2 Bayesian Neural Network Formulation  
We denote a pre-trained foundation network with parameters $\theta_0$. We introduce Bayesian posterior over weights $\theta$ conditioned on data $\mathcal{D}=\{x_i,y_i\}_{i=1}^N$. The goal is to approximate  
$$p(\theta\mid \mathcal{D}) \propto p(\mathcal{D}\mid \theta)\,p(\theta)\,. $$  
Bundle the foundation model into a Bayesian fine-tuning setup: only the last $L$ layers are treated as random variables, while early layers are held fixed or with lower variance priors to reduce computation. Let $\theta = (\theta_f,\theta_c)$ where $\theta_f$ are frozen and $\theta_c$ are classification/regression heads.  

2.3 Scalable Variational Inference  
We adopt Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB). Define a variational family $q_{\phi}(\theta_c)$ parameterized by $\phi$ (mean and variance for each weight); typically a mean‐field Gaussian:
$$q_{\phi}(\theta_c)=\prod_{j}\mathcal{N}(\theta_{c,j};\mu_j,\sigma_j^2)\,.$$
Optimize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):
$$\mathcal{L}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(\theta_c)}\big[\log p(\mathcal{D}\mid \theta)\big] - \mathrm{KL}\big(q_{\phi}(\theta_c)\,\|\,p(\theta_c)\big)\,.$$
We use the reparameterization trick: $\theta_c = \mu + \sigma\odot \epsilon$ with $\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)$. We minimize $-\mathcal{L}(\phi)$ via mini-batch SGD with Adam. Techniques for scalability include:
– Block‐diagonal covariance structures for $\sigma$ to reduce parameters.  
– Variational dropout (Molchanov et al.) to prune redundant weights.  
– Distributed training across GPUs.  

2.4 Incorporation of Domain-Specific Priors  
To infuse scientific knowledge, we define priors $p(\theta_c)$ that reflect physical laws or empirical constraints. For regression tasks predicting property $y=f(x;\theta)$, we can impose smoothness or known scaling relationships. For example, for energy predictions in QM9, we use a log‐normal prior on the output scale:
$$p(\theta_c)\propto \exp\big(-\lambda \|\nabla_x f(x;\theta)\|^2\big)\times\mathrm{LogNormal}(\sigma_{\rm energy};\alpha,\beta)\,,$$
where the gradient penalty enforces smooth dependence on molecular geometry and the log‐normal prior encodes known variance of energy predictions. In PDE applications, enforce conservation laws via constraint terms in the likelihood:
$$p(\mathcal{D}\mid \theta)\propto \exp\Big(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_i\|f(x_i;\theta)-y_i\|^2 -\frac{\gamma}{2}\sum_i\|\nabla\cdot f(x_i;\theta)\|^2\Big)\,,$$
penalizing divergence to satisfy incompressibility.  

2.5 Calibration Metrics for Scientific UQ  
We propose multiple evaluation metrics:  
– Negative Log Predictive Density (NLPD):  
$$\mathrm{NLPD}=-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\log p(y_i\mid x_i,\mathcal{D})\,. $$  
– Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) for regression:  
$$\mathrm{CRPS}(F,y)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\big(F(z)-\mathbf{1}\{z\ge y\}\big)^2 dz\,. $$  
– Expected Calibration Error (ECE) adapted for continuous outputs: bin predictions into intervals and compute
$$\mathrm{ECE} = \sum_{b=1}^B \frac{|I_b|}{N}\big|\mathrm{acc}(I_b) - \mathrm{conf}(I_b)\big|\,. $$  
Here, $\mathrm{acc}(I_b)$ is the empirical coverage of credible intervals in bin $b$, and $\mathrm{conf}(I_b)$ is the nominal confidence.  

2.6 Experimental Design  
We will compare BUQF against baselines:  
1. Deterministic fine-tuning of foundation model (no UQ).  
2. Deep ensemble of fine-tuned models.  
3. MC-Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani).  
4. Existing scalable BNN methods (White & Green, 2023).  

For each method and dataset, we will measure predictive accuracy (e.g., RMSE, MAE), UQ metrics (NLPD, CRPS, ECE), and computational cost (training time, memory). We will conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of:  
- Domain priors vs. standard Gaussian priors.  
- Full covariance vs. mean-field variational families.  
- Number of Bayesian layers ($L$) tuned as hyperparameter.  

Statistical significance will be assessed with bootstrapped confidence intervals.  

2.7 Uncertainty Visualization Tools  
We will develop a web-based dashboard using Python (Dash/Plotly) with the following features:  
– Prediction intervals overlayed on data points or spatial fields (for PDEs).  
– Sensitivity analysis plots showing how changing input variables affects credible intervals.  
– Uncertainty decomposition panels (aleatoric vs. epistemic).  
– Outlier detection highlighting points with high predictive uncertainty.  

These tools will be evaluated via user studies with domain scientists to assess interpretability and usability.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

– Ethical and Societal Benefits: In areas such as drug design, climate modeling, and materials development for clean energy, robust UQ can ensure safer decision-making with potentially life-changing or environmentally critical outcomes.  

Potential Challenges and Mitigation  
– Computational Overhead: We will exploit GPU clusters, parameter sharing, and low-rank variational approximations to make training feasible.  
– Prior Misspecification: We will include sanity checks via sensitivity analyses to ensure priors improve rather than degrade performance.  
– User Adoption: Early collaboration with domain experts and iterative user testing of visualization tools will ensure practical utility.
