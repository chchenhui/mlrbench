**Research Proposal: Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification for Scientific Foundation Models: A Scalable Framework Integrating Domain Knowledge and Robust Calibration**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized fields like natural language processing and computer vision by leveraging large-scale pretraining and transfer learning. Their application to scientific domains—such as materials science, quantum mechanics, and climate modeling—promises to accelerate discovery by automating complex tasks like solving partial differential equations (PDEs), predicting molecular properties, and analyzing multi-modal datasets. However, a critical gap remains: *scientific applications demand rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ)* to assess the reliability of predictions, especially when models are deployed in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., drug discovery or climate forecasting). Current FMs often lack robust UQ mechanisms, risking overconfident or uninterpretable predictions that could misguide scientific inquiry.  

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal aims to develop a **Bayesian framework for uncertainty-aware scientific foundation models** (SFMs) that:  
1. Quantifies predictive uncertainty while scaling to large models and datasets.  
2. Integrates domain-specific scientific constraints as Bayesian priors.  
3. Provides calibrated, interpretable uncertainty metrics tailored to scientific workflows.  

**Significance**  
By addressing the unique challenges of UQ in SFMs—such as noisy data, multi-modal inputs, and alignment with physical laws—this work will bridge the gap between the flexibility of FMs and the rigor required in scientific discovery. The framework will empower researchers to trust and refine model predictions, accelerating breakthroughs in domains where uncertainty propagation is critical.

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### **2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
- **Datasets**:  
  - **Physics/Chemistry**: Molecular dynamics trajectories (e.g., OpenCatalyst), PDE solutions (e.g., PDEBench).  
  - **Materials Science**: Crystallography databases (e.g., Materials Project), battery degradation datasets.  
  - **Climate Science**: ERA5 reanalysis data for weather modeling.  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Normalize domain-specific inputs (e.g., molecular graphs, PDE parameters).  
  - Introduce synthetic noise to evaluate robustness under data corruption.  

#### **2.2 Bayesian Framework Design**  
**Core Algorithm**: A hybrid Bayesian neural network (BNN) architecture combining:  
1. **Variational Inference (VI) for Scalability**:  
   - Use stochastic gradient variational inference (SGVI) to approximate posterior distributions over model weights.  
   - For a model with parameters $\theta$, observed data $D$, and prior $p(\theta)$, optimize the evidence lower bound (ELBO):  
     $$  
     \mathcal{L}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\theta)}[\log p(D|\theta)] - \text{KL}(q_\phi(\theta) \parallel p(\theta))  
     $$  
   - Implement **structured variational families** (e.g., matrix-normal distributions) to reduce computational overhead.  

2. **Domain-Scientific Priors**:  
   - Encode physical laws (e.g., conservation laws, symmetry constraints) as informative priors. For example:  
     - In PDE solving, enforce $p(\theta) \propto \exp(-\lambda \|\nabla \cdot u\|^2)$ to penalize divergence violations.  
   - Use hierarchical priors to handle multi-modal data (e.g., combining spectroscopy and microscopy inputs).  

3. **Calibration Metrics**:  
   - Develop **scientific calibration scores** (SCS) to assess uncertainty reliability:  
     $$  
     \text{SCS} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{I}\left(y_i \in [\mu_i - k\sigma_i, \mu_i + k\sigma_i]\right) - \text{Target Coverage}  
     $$  
   - Optimize calibration via temperature scaling or adversarial training.  

4. **Uncertainty Visualization**:  
   - Build interactive dashboards to display **credible intervals**, **sensitivity maps**, and **uncertainty decomposition** (aleatoric vs. epistemic).  

#### **2.3 Experimental Design**  
- **Benchmark Tasks**:  
  - **Task 1**: Predict molecular binding energies with uncertainty (QM9 dataset).  
  - **Task 2**: Solve parametric PDEs (e.g., Navier-Stokes) under noisy boundary conditions.  
  - **Task 3**: Forecast climate variables (temperature, precipitation) with multi-modal inputs.  
- **Baselines**: Compare against:  
  - Non-Bayesian FMs (e.g., pretrained SciBERT, GraphNVP).  
  - Existing UQ methods: MC-Dropout, Deep Ensembles, IB-UQ [1], NeuralUQ [3].  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - Predictive accuracy (RMSE, MAE).  
  - Uncertainty quality: calibration curves, sharpness (mean prediction interval width).  
  - Computational efficiency: training/inference time vs. dataset size.
