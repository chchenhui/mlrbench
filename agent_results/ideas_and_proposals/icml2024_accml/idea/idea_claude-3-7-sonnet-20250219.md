# Efficient Lab-in-the-Loop Learning for Biological Foundation Models

## Motivation
Foundation models show enormous promise for biological discovery but remain inaccessible to most wet labs due to computational requirements and the expertise needed to adapt them to specific research questions. Additionally, these models are typically deployed in a static manner, missing opportunities to incorporate valuable experimental feedback. A framework enabling iterative refinement of foundation models based on laboratory results would democratize access to advanced ML while improving model accuracy through real-world validation.

## Main Idea
We propose a lightweight framework for "Lab-in-the-Loop" learning that enables continuous refinement of biological foundation models through experimental feedback. The system employs: (1) A parameter-efficient adapter architecture that allows fine-tuning with minimal computational resources while preserving the foundation model's core capabilities; (2) A structured feedback mechanism where experimental outcomes are automatically encoded as learning signals; and (3) Uncertainty quantification that prioritizes predictions requiring laboratory validation. The framework operates on consumer-grade hardware and includes a web interface where biologists can upload experimental results, view model predictions, and schedule targeted experiments. This creates a virtuous cycle where model predictions guide experiments, and experimental results improve the model, dramatically accelerating discovery while making advanced ML accessible to typical biology labs.
