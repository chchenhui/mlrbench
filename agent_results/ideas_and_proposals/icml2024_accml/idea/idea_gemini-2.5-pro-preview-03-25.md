**Title:** Federated and Efficient Fine-Tuning for Collaborative Biological Discovery

**Motivation:** Biological labs often generate specialized, sensitive datasets. While foundation models offer powerful priors, fine-tuning them centrally requires sharing potentially private data and significant computational resources per lab. There's a need for methods allowing labs to collaboratively benefit from fine-tuning on diverse datasets without data sharing and prohibitive costs.

**Main Idea:** Develop a federated learning framework coupled with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., LoRA, Adapters) for biological foundation models. Participating labs fine-tune only a small subset of parameters locally on their specific data. Instead of raw data, only these lightweight parameter updates are securely aggregated (e.g., using secure aggregation protocols) by a central server to create an improved global model, which is then redistributed. This approach preserves data privacy, drastically reduces communication overhead, and minimizes the computational burden on individual labs. Expected outcomes include improved model performance on diverse tasks through collaborative refinement, maintained data confidentiality, and democratized access to state-of-the-art model adaptation for labs with limited resources.
