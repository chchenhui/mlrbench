### Title: Compositional Learning for Dynamic Real-World Distributions

### Motivation
The ability to generalize and reason compositionally is crucial for machines to adapt to ever-changing real-world conditions. Current foundation models struggle with compositional generalization in dynamic environments, limiting their practical applicability. This research aims to address this gap by enhancing the compositional learning capabilities of models, thereby improving their robustness and adaptability.

### Main Idea
This research focuses on developing modular learning strategies that ensure compositional generalization in dynamic real-world distributions. The proposed method involves:
1. **Modular Architecture Design**: Utilizing a mixture of experts (MoE) framework to create a modular architecture that can learn and recombine components effectively.
2. **Domain-Agnostic Data Augmentation**: Implementing data augmentation techniques that are transferable across different domains, enhancing the model's ability to generalize.
3. **Continual Learning Adaptation**: Integrating continual learning mechanisms to adapt to new data distributions over time, ensuring that the model can recombine learned components dynamically.

The expected outcomes include:
- Improved compositional generalization capabilities in foundation models.
- Enhanced adaptability to dynamic real-world distributions.
- Development of model-agnostic strategies for compositional learning.

The potential impact includes broader applicability of foundation models in various domains, such as machine translation, cross-lingual transfer, and reinforcement learning, where dynamic and frequently changing distributions are common. This research could significantly advance the state-of-the-art in compositional learning, making machines more capable of understanding and reasoning in complex and evolving environments.
