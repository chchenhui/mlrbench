**Title:** Dynamic Component Adaptation for Continual Compositional Learning

**Motivation:** Compositional learning enables generalization by recombining known components, but fails when these components or their combination rules change over time, a hallmark of continual learning environments. Existing methods often assume static primitives, limiting their applicability in dynamic worlds and leading to catastrophic forgetting or obsolescence. This research aims to bridge this gap.

**Main Idea:** We propose a framework where compositional learning models dynamically adapt their primitive components and composition mechanisms in response to evolving data streams. This involves integrating (1) Concept drift detection tailored to compositional representations, identifying shifts in component semantics or relationships. (2) Incremental component learning using techniques like generative replay or parameter isolation to update/add components without catastrophic forgetting. (3) Adaptive composition mechanisms (e.g., attention, routing) that adjust how components are combined based on new evidence. We expect this approach to enable robust compositional reasoning and generalization in non-stationary environments, evaluated on benchmarks featuring evolving tasks or changing object appearances/relationships.
