# Dynamic Component Adaptation for Continual Compositional Learning

## 1. Introduction

The ability to understand and generate complex ideas by combining simpler concepts is a fundamental aspect of human cognition. This compositional capacity enables humans to generalize knowledge efficiently, adapting to new situations by recombining learned primitives in novel ways. In artificial intelligence, compositional learning aims to replicate this ability, allowing models to decompose complex inputs into simpler components and recombine them to generalize to unseen scenarios. This approach has shown promise across various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning, particularly for improving generalization to out-of-distribution samples.

However, a critical limitation of current compositional learning approaches is their reliance on static primitives and composition rules. Real-world environments are dynamic and continuously evolving, requiring models to adapt their component representations and composition mechanisms over time. This challenge sits at the intersection of compositional learning and continual learningâ€”two areas that have largely developed independently. While compositional learning focuses on combining stable components to achieve generalization, continual learning addresses the challenge of acquiring new knowledge without forgetting previous learning. The integration of these approaches remains largely unexplored, presenting a significant research gap.

The rapid advancement of foundation models has further highlighted this limitation. Even large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models struggle with compositional generalization in dynamic environments, where both the components themselves and the rules for combining them may evolve. This challenge becomes especially pronounced in scenarios requiring continuous adaptation to new concepts, relations, or tasks without catastrophic forgetting.

### Research Objectives

This research proposes a novel framework called "Dynamic Component Adaptation for Continual Compositional Learning" (DCA-CCL) that addresses the limitations of current compositional learning approaches in non-stationary environments. The framework integrates component drift detection, incremental component learning, and adaptive composition mechanisms to enable continuous adaptation while preserving compositional generalization capabilities. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Develop a specialized concept drift detection mechanism tailored to compositional representations, capable of identifying shifts in component semantics or the rules governing their combination.

2. Design incremental component learning methods that allow models to update existing components or add new ones without catastrophic forgetting.

3. Create adaptive composition mechanisms that dynamically adjust how components are combined based on evolving data distributions.

4. Evaluate the proposed framework on benchmarks featuring evolving tasks and changing object appearances/relationships to demonstrate its effectiveness in dynamic environments.

### Significance

The successful development of this framework would represent a significant advancement in both compositional and continual learning fields. By enabling models to maintain compositional generalization capabilities while adapting to changing environments, this research addresses a fundamental limitation of current approaches. The practical applications span numerous domains:

- In natural language processing, models could adapt to evolving language use and new concepts while preserving compositional understanding.
- In computer vision, systems could continuously learn new visual primitives and relationships as they encounter them, enabling more robust visual reasoning.
- In multimodal learning, models could adapt their cross-modal compositional mappings as the relationships between modalities evolve.
- In reinforcement learning, agents could continuously expand their repertoire of skills and learn new ways to compose them for increasingly complex tasks.

Beyond these practical applications, this research contributes to our theoretical understanding of compositional learning by exploring the relationship between modularity and compositional generalization in dynamic settings. It also establishes a bridge between compositional and continual learning, potentially opening new research directions at this intersection.

## 2. Methodology

The proposed Dynamic Component Adaptation for Continual Compositional Learning (DCA-CCL) framework consists of three main components: (1) Component Drift Detection, (2) Incremental Component Learning, and (3) Adaptive Composition Mechanisms. These components work together to enable continual compositional learning in non-stationary environments. The overall architecture is illustrated in Figure 1 [note: figure not included in this textual proposal].

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

We consider a continual learning scenario where a model receives a stream of data $\{(x_t, y_t)\}_{t=1}^T$ from a non-stationary distribution. The distribution may change over time due to:
- Shifts in the semantics of primitive components
- Changes in the rules governing how components are combined
- Introduction of entirely new components

The objective is to maintain a model that performs well across all tasks encountered so far, even as these changes occur. We assume the model decomposes inputs into a set of components $\{c_1, c_2, ..., c_K\}$ and combines them using some composition function $f$ to produce outputs.

### 2.2 Component Drift Detection

To identify when and how components evolve over time, we develop a specialized drift detection mechanism tailored to compositional representations. This mechanism monitors changes in both the component distributions and their relationships.

#### 2.2.1 Representation Space Monitoring

We maintain a memory bank $M$ of exemplar embeddings for each identified component. For a new batch of data, we extract component representations and compare them with the stored exemplars using the Maximum Component Discrepancy (MCD) metric:

$$MCD(c_i^{new}, c_i^{stored}) = \max_{z \in \Phi} \left| \mathbb{E}_{x \sim c_i^{new}}[z(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{x \sim c_i^{stored}}[z(x)] \right|$$

where $\Phi$ is a class of test functions. In practice, we implement this using a contrastive learning approach, where:

$$MCD(c_i^{new}, c_i^{stored}) = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \cos(e_j^{new}, NN_M(e_j^{new}))$$

where $e_j^{new}$ represents the embedding of the j-th sample from the new data for component $c_i$, and $NN_M(e_j^{new})$ is its nearest neighbor in the memory bank.

#### 2.2.2 Composition Rule Monitoring

In addition to monitoring individual components, we track changes in how components interact. We define a composition graph $G = (V, E)$ where vertices $V$ represent components and edges $E$ represent their co-occurrence or compositional relationships. For each new batch of data, we update a temporary graph $G'$ and compute the graph edit distance:

$$GED(G, G') = \min_{(e_1,...,e_k) \in P(G,G')} \sum_{i=1}^{k} c(e_i)$$

where $P(G,G')$ is the set of edit paths transforming $G$ into $G'$, and $c(e_i)$ is the cost of each edit operation. A significant increase in this distance indicates a drift in composition rules.

#### 2.2.3 Drift Response Mechanism

When drift is detected, our system categorizes it into one of three types:
1. **Component Drift**: Semantics of existing components change
2. **Composition Drift**: Rules for combining components change
3. **Novel Component**: New components appear

Each type triggers a different adaptation strategy in the incremental component learning module.

### 2.3 Incremental Component Learning

Once drift is detected, the model must update its component representations and composition mechanisms. We employ several techniques to achieve this without catastrophic forgetting:

#### 2.3.1 Component-Specific Parameter Isolation

For each component $c_i$, we maintain a dedicated set of parameters $\theta_i$. When updating a component due to drift, we selectively modify only the relevant parameters:

$$\theta_i^{new} = \theta_i^{old} + \alpha \cdot \nabla_{\theta_i} \mathcal{L}(x_{new}, y_{new}; \theta_i, \phi)$$

where $\phi$ represents the parameters of the composition mechanism, and $\alpha$ is a learning rate that may be adjusted based on the severity of detected drift.

#### 2.3.2 Generative Replay for Component Consolidation

To prevent forgetting previous component representations, we employ a generative replay mechanism. For each component $c_i$, we train a lightweight generative model $G_i$ that can produce synthetic examples of that component:

$$\hat{x}_i \sim G_i(z; \psi_i), \, z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$$

When updating the model to adapt to new data, we augment the training batch with generated examples of previously learned components:

$$\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}(x_{new}, y_{new}; \theta, \phi) + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}(\hat{x}_{old}, \hat{y}_{old}; \theta, \phi)$$

where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter balancing new learning and preservation of existing knowledge.

#### 2.3.3 Component Expansion Strategy

When novel components are detected, we dynamically expand the model's component library. This expansion follows a resource-efficient strategy:

1. Initialize new component parameters $\theta_{K+1}$ using a combination of knowledge distillation from existing components and direct learning from new examples.
2. Establish connections between the new component and existing ones in the composition graph.
3. Update the composition mechanism to incorporate the new component.

The component expansion is governed by:

$$\theta_{K+1} = \arg\min_{\theta} \left[ \mathcal{L}_{task}(x_{new}, y_{new}; \theta) + \beta \cdot \mathcal{L}_{distill}(x_{new}; \theta, \{\theta_i\}_{i=1}^K) \right]$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{distill}$ is a distillation loss transferring relevant knowledge from existing components to the new one, and $\beta$ controls the influence of this knowledge transfer.

### 2.4 Adaptive Composition Mechanisms

The final core component of our framework is an adaptive composition mechanism that dynamically adjusts how components are combined based on the evolving data distribution.

#### 2.4.1 Attention-based Dynamic Routing

We implement a neural router that determines how components should be combined for each input:

$$\alpha_i(x) = \frac{\exp(g_i(x))}{\sum_{j=1}^K \exp(g_j(x))}$$

$$f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^K \alpha_i(x) \cdot h_i(x; \theta_i)$$

where $g_i(x)$ is a routing function determining the importance of component $i$ for input $x$, and $h_i(x; \theta_i)$ is the output of component $i$. The routing functions $g_i$ are updated continuously based on new data.

#### 2.4.2 Meta-learning for Composition Adaptation

To rapidly adapt composition rules when drift is detected, we employ a meta-learning approach:

$$\phi^{new} = \phi^{old} - \gamma \cdot \nabla_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_{meta}(D_{adapt}; \phi^{old})$$

where $D_{adapt}$ is a small adaptation dataset collected after drift detection, and $\mathcal{L}_{meta}$ is a meta-objective designed to optimize adaptation speed. The meta-learning process is structured as:

1. Inner loop: Adapt composition parameters to new data
2. Outer loop: Optimize for fast adaptation while maintaining performance on previous tasks

#### 2.4.3 Elastic Weight Consolidation for Composition Stability

To prevent drastic changes in composition rules that might disrupt previously learned capabilities, we incorporate Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC):

$$\mathcal{L}_{EWC}(\phi) = \sum_{i} \frac{\lambda_{EWC}}{2} F_i (\phi_i - \phi_i^*)^2$$

where $F_i$ is the Fisher information matrix indicating parameter importance, $\phi_i^*$ are the old parameter values, and $\lambda_{EWC}$ controls the strength of the regularization.

### 2.5 Experimental Design

We will evaluate our framework across multiple domains and tasks to demonstrate its effectiveness for continual compositional learning.

#### 2.5.1 Benchmarks and Datasets

1. **Evolving CLEVR**: We extend the CLEVR dataset for visual reasoning by introducing gradual changes in object appearances and relationships over time.

2. **Dynamic SCAN**: We modify the SCAN dataset (for compositional language understanding) to include evolving language patterns and compositional rules.

3. **Continual VQA**: A visual question answering setup where new visual concepts and question types are introduced sequentially.

4. **Compositional RL environments**: Custom environments where both primitive actions and composition rules evolve over time.

4. **State-of-the-art foundation models**: Evaluating their inherent compositional and continual learning capabilities

#### 2.5.3 Evaluation Metrics

We will assess performance using:

1. **Average Accuracy (AA)**: $AA = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{i=1}^{T} A_{i,T}$, where $A_{i,T}$ is the accuracy on task $i$ after training on task $T$.

2. **Backward Transfer (BWT)**: $BWT = \frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{i=1}^{T-1} (A_{i,T} - A_{i,i})$, measuring forgetting or improvement on previous tasks.

3. **Compositional Generalization Score (CGS)**: A custom metric measuring performance on novel compositions of previously seen components:
   $$CGS = \frac{1}{|D_{comp}|} \sum_{(x,y) \in D_{comp}} \mathbb{I}[f(x) = y]$$
   where $D_{comp}$ is a set of examples featuring novel compositions.

4. **Adaptation Efficiency (AE)**: Measures how quickly the model adapts to new components or composition rules:
   $$AE = \frac{1}{|D_{adapt}|} \sum_{t=1}^{|D_{adapt}|} A_t$$
   where $A_t$ is the accuracy after seeing $t$ examples from the adaptation set.
