# Efficient and Targeted Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models: A Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Approach

## 1. Introduction

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have been significantly shaped by the development of large-scale pre-trained models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, PaLM, and Llama. These models, trained on vast corpora of text data from the internet, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, from text generation to complex reasoning. However, their scale and the breadth of their training data introduce significant challenges related to trustworthiness and reliability. LLMs have been shown to memorize sensitive personal information, reproduce harmful biases, and generate toxic content, raising serious privacy, ethical, and legal concerns (Bender et al., 2021).

As these models are increasingly deployed in critical domains such as healthcare, education, and legal services, the need to address their potential negative impacts becomes paramount. This is particularly urgent in light of regulatory frameworks like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, which establishes a "right to be forgotten," requiring that personal data be deleted upon request. In the context of machine learning models that have been trained on personal data, this necessitates mechanisms to "unlearn" specific information without compromising overall model performance.

Traditional approaches to removing unwanted information from trained models typically involve retraining the entire model from scratch on a filtered dataset that excludes the data to be forgotten. For LLMs with billions of parameters, this approach is prohibitively expensive in terms of computational resources, time, and energy consumption. For instance, retraining GPT-3 (175B parameters) requires approximately 3,640 petaflop-days of computing and costs millions of dollars (Brown et al., 2020). This makes conventional retraining approaches impractical for real-world deployment scenarios where timely responses to privacy requests or the discovery of harmful content are essential.

Machine unlearning—the process of selectively removing the influence of specific training data from a model—has emerged as a promising alternative to full retraining. However, existing machine unlearning methods often struggle with scalability to large models, precision in targeting specific information, and maintaining model utility. Recent works like Fast-NTK (Li et al., 2023) and S3T (Chowdhury et al., 2024) have begun exploring parameter-efficient approaches to unlearning, but significant challenges remain in developing unlearning methods that are simultaneously computationally efficient, effective at targeted forgetting, and robust in preserving model performance.

### Research Objectives

This research proposal aims to address these challenges by developing a novel framework for efficient and targeted machine unlearning in Large Language Models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Design a scalable methodology for identifying parameters most influenced by specific data subsets (e.g., private or harmful content) within LLMs using gradient-based influence estimation.

2. Develop a parameter-efficient unlearning mechanism that isolates and modifies data-specific influences while preserving general knowledge and capabilities.

3. Establish formal guarantees for the effectiveness of unlearning in terms of both privacy protection and model utility.

4. Create an evaluation benchmark for assessing LLM unlearning across multiple dimensions, including forgetting completeness, computational efficiency, and preservation of beneficial capabilities.

### Significance

The proposed research addresses a critical gap in the deployment of large-scale machine learning models in real-world applications. By enabling efficient and targeted unlearning in LLMs, this work will:

1. Facilitate compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR, making large models more suitable for regulated domains.

2. Provide a mechanism for removing identified harmful, biased, or toxic content from deployed models, enhancing their trustworthiness and social acceptability.

3. Reduce the environmental impact of large model maintenance by avoiding energy-intensive retraining processes.

4. Establish new methodological foundations for parameter-efficient modifications of large pre-trained models that can extend beyond unlearning to other forms of model updating and adaptation.

This work sits at the intersection of several important research areas including machine learning, privacy, ethics, and computational efficiency, with the potential to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in trustworthy and reliable AI systems.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed methodology integrates parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques with gradient-based influence estimation to enable scalable, targeted, and effective unlearning in Large Language Models. The approach consists of four main components: (1) influence estimation and parameter identification, (2) parameter-efficient unlearning, (3) knowledge preservation through lightweight fine-tuning, and (4) validation with formal guarantees.

### 2.1 Influence Estimation and Parameter Identification

The first step in our approach is to identify the model parameters most influenced by the data to be unlearned (referred to as the "forget set" $D_f$). We propose a gradient-based influence estimation method that builds upon the influence functions framework (Koh & Liang, 2017) but is adapted for the scale and architecture of Large Language Models.

For a pre-trained LLM with parameters $\theta$, trained on a dataset $D$, we aim to estimate the influence of each subset $D_f \subset D$ on specific parameters. The influence of a data point $z = (x, y)$ on a parameter $\theta_i$ can be approximated as:

$$I(z, \theta_i) = \nabla_{\theta_i} \mathcal{L}(z, \theta)$$

where $\mathcal{L}(z, \theta)$ is the loss function for data point $z$.

For computational efficiency, we propose aggregating these influences across the forget set and computing a saliency score for each parameter (or parameter group):

$$S(\theta_i, D_f) = \left\| \frac{1}{|D_f|} \sum_{z \in D_f} \nabla_{\theta_i} \mathcal{L}(z, \theta) \right\|$$

To make this computation tractable for LLMs, we will employ several optimizations:

1. **Stochastic approximation**: Computing gradients on randomly sampled mini-batches from $D_f$ rather than the entire forget set.

2. **Layer-wise aggregation**: Computing influence scores at the level of layer groups (e.g., attention heads, MLP blocks) rather than individual parameters.

3. **Pruning**: Focusing on the top-k most influenced components based on preliminary influence estimates.

We will further refine this process by analyzing the eigenspectrum of the gradient covariance matrix to identify low-dimensional subspaces that capture most of the influence of the forget set, inspired by recent work in analyzing neural network training dynamics (Gur-Ari et al., 2018).

### 2.2 Parameter-Efficient Unlearning Mechanism

Once we have identified the parameters or parameter subspaces most influenced by the forget set, we will implement a parameter-efficient unlearning mechanism using adapter-based approaches. Instead of modifying the entire model, we will insert small trainable modules (adapters) into the model architecture that can efficiently counteract the influence of the forget set.

We propose a novel Low-Rank Adaptation for Unlearning (LoRA-U) approach, extending the LoRA method (Hu et al., 2021) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. For each weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$ in the model that has been identified as highly influenced by the forget set, we introduce low-rank update matrices:

$$W' = W + \Delta W = W + BA$$

where $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ and $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$ are low-rank matrices with rank $r \ll \min(d, k)$.

The unlearning objective is to optimize these adaptors to minimize the model's performance on the forget set while maintaining performance on a representative retain set $D_r$:

$$\min_{A, B} \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{retain}(D_r, \theta') - \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{forget}(D_f, \theta')$$

where $\theta'$ represents the model parameters with the LoRA-U adaptors, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are hyperparameters that control the trade-off between retaining general knowledge and forgetting specific information.

To enhance the unlearning effect, we will incorporate a gradient ascent component (inspired by Pan et al., 2024) that actively pushes the model away from the forget set:

$$\Delta W_{GA} = \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}(D_f, \theta)$$

where $\eta$ is a learning rate parameter.

The final unlearning update combines both components:

$$W' = W + BA - \Delta W_{GA}$$

### 2.3 Knowledge Preservation through Lightweight Fine-Tuning

After applying the unlearning adaptors, we need to ensure that the model retains its general capabilities and knowledge. We propose a two-stage approach:

1. **Masked Training**: We will employ a masked language modeling objective on a curated dataset $D_c$ that excludes content similar to the forget set but covers the general knowledge domains. This helps the model relearn patterns that might have been affected by the unlearning process.

2. **Focused Reinforcement**: For specific capabilities that might be degraded during unlearning, we will apply targeted reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to restore the model's performance on tasks like instruction following, reasoning, and safety.

The knowledge preservation objective is formulated as:

$$\min_{A, B} \sum_{z \in D_c} \mathcal{L}_{MLM}(z, \theta') + \alpha \mathcal{L}_{RLHF}(D_{rlhf}, \theta')$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{MLM}$ is the masked language modeling loss, $\mathcal{L}_{RLHF}$ is the reinforcement learning loss, and $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter balancing these objectives.

### 2.4 Validation with Formal Guarantees

To provide formal guarantees for our unlearning approach, we will define and evaluate differential unlearning, inspired by differential privacy concepts:

A machine unlearning mechanism $M$ satisfies $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential unlearning if for any two datasets $D$ and $D'$ that differ by a single example, and for any set of outputs $S$:

$$P(M(D) \in S) \leq e^{\epsilon} \cdot P(M(D') \in S) + \delta$$

We will adapt this definition to our parameter-efficient setting and develop analytical bounds on the privacy leakage of our approach.

Additionally, we will establish theoretical guarantees on the performance preservation properties of our method, deriving bounds on the expected performance drop on tasks unrelated to the forget set.

### 2.5 Implementation Details

Our implementation will target widely used open-source LLMs like Llama-2 (7B and 13B parameter versions) and Mistral (7B), with the potential to scale to larger models if computational resources permit.

For the influence estimation, we will leverage techniques from the SalUn framework (Fan et al., 2023) to efficiently compute gradient-based saliency, extending these approaches to transformer-based language models.

The parameter-efficient adaptors will be implemented using the PEFT library, with our custom extensions for the unlearning objective. We will experiment with different adapter configurations, including bottleneck adapters, prefix tuning, and LoRA, to determine the most effective approach for unlearning.

### 2.6 Experimental Design

To evaluate our approach, we will conduct experiments across the following dimensions:

1. **Unlearning Efficacy**: We will assess the model's ability to forget targeted information using both direct and indirect methods:
   - Direct: Measuring perplexity and loss on the forget set before and after unlearning
   - Indirect: Testing prompts designed to elicit knowledge from the forget set
   - Memorization tests: Evaluating whether specific facts from the forget set can be extracted

2. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - Training time compared to full retraining (target: <5% of full retraining cost)
   - Memory requirements
   - Number of trainable parameters (target: <1% of model parameters)

3. **Knowledge Preservation**:
   - Performance on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HellaSwag, TruthfulQA)
   - Task-specific evaluations for domains unrelated to the forget set
   - Consistency of responses before and after unlearning

4. **Formal Guarantees**:
   - Empirical evaluation of differential unlearning bounds
   - Membership inference attack resistance after unlearning
   - Model extraction attack resilience

We will create multiple forget sets representing different unlearning scenarios:

1. **Personal Information Removal**: Curated datasets containing synthetic personal information
2. **Toxic Content Removal**: Subsets of toxic content from datasets like RealToxicityPrompts
3. **Bias Mitigation**: Content exhibiting specific demographic biases
4. **Copyright Compliance**: Text from specific copyrighted sources

For each scenario, we will measure both the effectiveness of forgetting and the preservation of desirable model capabilities.

### 3.3 Limitations and Ethical Considerations

While our research aims to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs, we acknowledge several potential limitations and ethical considerations:

1. **Incomplete Forgetting**: Perfect unlearning may be theoretically challenging or impossible to achieve, potentially leaving residual traces of the forgotten information in the model.

2. **Dual-Use Concerns**: Technologies for selective model modification could potentially be misused to remove beneficial safety constraints or ethical guidelines from models.

3. **Benchmark Limitations**: Our evaluation benchmarks may not capture all relevant dimensions of unlearning effectiveness, particularly for subtle forms of memorization.

4. **Generalization Challenges**: The effectiveness of our approach may vary across different model architectures, sizes, and pre-training methodologies.

We will address these concerns through careful experimental design, transparent reporting of limitations, and exploration of safeguards against potential misuse.

In conclusion, this research proposal outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing one of the most significant challenges in deploying large language models in real-world applications: the ability to efficiently and effectively remove unwanted information while preserving model utility. The proposed parameter-efficient unlearning framework has the potential to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in trustworthy and reliable AI systems, with broad implications for privacy, ethics, and the practical deployment of AI technologies.
