# Scalable Machine Unlearning via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Trustworthy Large Language Models  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI through their ability to process and generate human-like text. However, their training on massive datasets raises critical concerns about memorization of sensitive information, perpetuation of harmful biases, and environmental costs of retraining. Standard machine unlearning approaches—designed to remove specific data influences—are computationally infeasible for trillion-parameter models, often requiring full retraining. Recent work in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and influence estimation provides a potential pathway for scalable solutions, but existing methods lack precision in targeting specific data footprints while preserving model utility. This research addresses the urgent need for efficient, verifiable unlearning mechanisms in deployed LLMs to meet regulatory and ethical requirements.  

### Research Objectives  
1. Develop a gradient-informed framework that isolates data-specific parameter influences into modular PEFT components.  
2. Establish formal guarantees for differential unlearning and adversarial robustness.  
3. Create benchmarks for evaluating unlearning efficacy across privacy, fairness, and utility metrics.  
4. Reduce computational overhead to <5% of full retraining while maintaining model performance.  

### Significance  
The proposed methodology enables compliance with GDPR's "right to be forgotten" in LLM deployments while mitigating risks of toxic output generation and private data leakage. By combining influence tracing with PEFT techniques, we provide a paradigm shift from resource-intensive retraining to targeted model editing—with direct applications in healthcare, legal tech, and education systems.  

## 2. Methodology  

### Framework Overview  
The system operates through three phases:  

#### Phase 1: Gradient-Based Influence Estimation  
For a target data subset $\mathcal{D}_{\text{forget}}$, compute parameter influence scores using a modified influence function:  

$$I_\theta(z) = \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(z) \cdot H_{\theta}^{-1}$$  

where $H_{\theta}$ is the Hessian of the loss over retained data $\mathcal{D}_{\text{retain}}$. To avoid explicit Hessian inversion (computationally prohibitive for LLMs), we implement stochastic Neumann series approximation:  

$$H^{-1} \approx \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{k=0}^K \left(I - \frac{1}{\lambda} H\right)^k$$  

This identifies top-$k$ parameters $P_{\text{critical}}$ most influenced by $\mathcal{D}_{\text{forget}}$.  

#### Phase 2: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Architecture  
Freeze the base model $\theta_{\text{core}}$ and instantiate modular adapters $\theta_{\text{adapt}}$ using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):  

$$\theta_{\text{total}} = \theta_{\text{core}} + W_{\text{down}} \cdot W_{\text{up}}$$  

where $W_{\text{down}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$, $W_{\text{up}} \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d}$ are low-rank matrices ($r \ll d$). The adapter parameters are trained on $\mathcal{D}_{\text{retain}}$ with a multi-task objective:  

$$\min_{\theta_{\text{adapt}}} \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{retain}}}[\mathcal{L}(z)]}_{\text{Utility}} + \lambda \underbrace{\|\theta_{\text{adapt}} \odot \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D}_{\text{forget}})\|_1}_{\text{Forgetting Regularizer}}$$  

This isolates $\mathcal{D}_{\text{forget}}$'s influence to the sparse adapter parameters.  

#### Phase 3: Selective Unlearning and Refinement  
1. **Parameter Masking**: Apply magnitude pruning to $\theta_{\text{adapt}}$ with mask $M$:  
   $$M_i = \begin{cases} 
   0 & \text{if } |\theta_{\text{adapt}}^{(i)}| < \tau \\
   1 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}$$  
   where $\tau$ is dynamically set to remove the top 95% of adapter weights by influence score.  

2. **Adaptive Fine-Tuning**: Retrain the masked adapter on purified data $\mathcal{D}_{\text{purified}} = \mathcal{D}_{\text{retain}} \cup \mathcal{D}_{\text{synth}}$, where $\mathcal{D}_{\text{synth}}$ is generated through:  
   $$x_{\text{gen}} = \text{argmin}_x \|\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(x) - \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D}_{\text{forget}})\|_2$$  

This synthetic data bridges the utility gap caused by unlearning.
