# Scalable Machine Unlearning via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models

## Introduction

### Background
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language understanding and generation tasks, demonstrating their potential in various applications from healthcare to education. However, the scale at which these models are trained, often using massive datasets, poses significant challenges in terms of privacy, fairness, and robustness. LLMs can inadvertently memorize sensitive or biased content, leading to privacy breaches and ethical issues. Moreover, the computational resources required to retrain these models from scratch to remove specific data points are prohibitive. Existing machine unlearning methods, while promising, often lack the scalability and precision needed for large-scale models.

### Research Objectives
The primary objective of this research is to develop a scalable and efficient machine unlearning framework for large language models. Specifically, the research aims to:
1. Integrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques with gradient-based influence estimation to enable targeted and efficient unlearning.
2. Develop a modular approach that isolates data-specific influences into PEFT components, facilitating selective removal or perturbation.
3. Maintain a balance between unlearning specific data points and preserving the overall performance and utility of the model.
4. Provide formal privacy guarantees, such as differential unlearning, to ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR.
5. Evaluate the proposed method on a benchmark dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in mitigating privacy and ethical risks in deployed models.

### Significance
The research is significant because it addresses the critical need for scalable and efficient machine unlearning in large language models. By providing a targeted and efficient approach to unlearning, the proposed method will enable compliance with privacy regulations and mitigate ethical risks associated with the deployment of large-scale AI models. Furthermore, the research will contribute to the development of a benchmark for LLM unlearning efficacy and a toolkit to mitigate bias and privacy risks in deployed models.

## Methodology

### Research Design

#### 1. Data Collection
For this research, we will use a diverse dataset consisting of publicly available LLM datasets, such as the OpenWebText dataset, the Common Crawl dataset, and the Wikipedia dataset. These datasets will be partitioned into public and private subsets, with the public subset used for training the backbone model and the private subset used for optimizing prompts.

#### 2. Model Architecture
We will use a pre-trained LLM as the backbone model. For the PEFT components, we will employ techniques such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and adapters, which allow for efficient fine-tuning by modifying only a small subset of the model parameters.

#### 3. Gradient-based Influence Estimation
To identify parameters most affected by target data subsets, we will use gradient tracing. Specifically, we will compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters for the target data subset and use these gradients to estimate the influence of the data on the model.

#### 4. Modular Unlearning
Based on the gradient-based influence estimation, we will isolate data-specific influences into modular PEFT components. These components will be "frozen" during the unlearning process, and the model will be fine-tuned on a purified dataset to preserve general knowledge.

#### 5. Fine-Tuning
After isolating the data-specific influences, we will fine-tune the model on a purified dataset, which excludes the target data subset. The fine-tuning process will involve selectively removing or perturbing the PEFT components to achieve targeted unlearning.

### Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, we will use the following metrics:

1. **Unlearning Accuracy**: The accuracy of the model in forgetting the target data subset.
2. **Model Performance**: The overall performance of the model after unlearning, measured using standard evaluation metrics such as perplexity and BLEU score.
3. **Computational Efficiency**: The computational resources required for the unlearning process, measured in terms of time and memory usage.
4. **Privacy Guarantees**: Formal privacy guarantees, such as differential unlearning, will be provided to ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes
1. **Benchmark for LLM Unlearning Efficacy**: The research will establish a benchmark for LLM unlearning efficacy, enabling the evaluation and comparison of different unlearning methods.
2. **Toolkit for Mitigating Bias/Privacy Risks**: The proposed method will be developed into a toolkit that can be used to mitigate bias and privacy risks in deployed LLMs, enabling compliance with regulations like GDPR.
3. **Formal Privacy Guarantees**: The research will provide formal privacy guarantees, such as differential unlearning, to ensure the compliance of the proposed method with privacy regulations.

### Impact
The research will have a significant impact on the development and deployment of large language models. By providing a scalable and efficient method for machine unlearning, the research will enable the mitigation of privacy and ethical risks associated with the deployment of large-scale AI models. Furthermore, the research will contribute to the development of a benchmark for LLM unlearning efficacy and a toolkit to mitigate bias and privacy risks in deployed models, enabling compliance with privacy regulations and promoting the responsible use of AI.
