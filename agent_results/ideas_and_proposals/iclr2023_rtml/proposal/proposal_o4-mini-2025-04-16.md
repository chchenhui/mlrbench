Title  
Scalable and Precise Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and Gradient-Based Influence Estimation  

Introduction  
Background  
Large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs) such as GPT, PaLM and LLaMA have demonstrated remarkable performance across a range of natural language tasks. However, their reliance on massive, uncurated datasets introduces serious privacy and ethical risks: models may memorize and reproduce sensitive personal data, reinforce social biases, or generate toxic content. When stakeholders request deletion of their data under regulations like GDPR or CCPA, the naively exact solution‚Äîretraining the model from scratch on the remaining data‚Äîis computationally infeasible for modern LLMs. Recent ‚Äúmachine unlearning‚Äù methods (e.g., Fast-NTK, S3T, LMEraser, SalUn) reduce the cost of unlearning but either target smaller models, lack formal guarantees, or degrade overall model utility.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a scalable, precise, and provably private unlearning framework for LLMs that:  
1. Identifies and isolates the model components most influenced by the data to be forgotten.  
2. Enables targeted deletion or perturbation of those components with minimal compute overhead (<5% of full retraining).  
3. Preserves model performance on the retained data across classification and generation tasks.  
4. Provides formal privacy guarantees (differential unlearning) for regulatory compliance.  

Significance  
Our approach addresses key challenges in trustworthy large-scale AI: it mitigates privacy, toxicity, and bias risks in deployed LLMs without prohibitive cost; bridges the gap between theory and practice by delivering formal unlearning guarantees; and yields a practical toolkit and benchmark to facilitate adoption by industry and compliance with data-deletion mandates.  

Methodology  
Overview  
We propose a four-stage unlearning pipeline:  
A. PEFT Decomposition  
B. Influence Estimation  
C. Targeted Module Unlearning  
D. Post-Deletion Fine-Tuning and Privacy Accounting  

A. PEFT Decomposition  
We begin with a pre-trained LLM fŒ∏‚ÇÄ: X‚ÜíY parameterized by Œ∏‚ÇÄ‚àà‚Ñù·µà. To capture data-specific information in a low-dimensional subspace, we insert parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules (LoRA) at each transformer block. Let Œ¥={ŒîW·µ¢,ŒîV·µ¢} denote the collection of low-rank adapters for layers i=1‚Ä¶L. The full model becomes f(Œ∏‚ÇÄ,Œ¥). We freeze Œ∏‚ÇÄ and train only Œ¥ on the full training set D to obtain Œ¥*. Because dim(Œ¥) ‚â™ d, the majority of memorized and biased content is expected to concentrate in Œ¥*.  

B. Influence Estimation  
Given a subset D_R‚äÇD of samples to forget (e.g., toxic, private), we compute the influence of D_R on each adapter module via gradient tracing. For module Œ¥·µ¢ at layer i, define its influence score  
  g·µ¢ = ‚à•E_{(x,y)‚ààD_R}[‚àá_{Œ¥·µ¢} L(f(Œ∏‚ÇÄ,Œ¥*),x,y)]‚à•‚ÇÇ.  
We rank modules by g·µ¢ and select the top-k adapters (indices in set M) that carry the largest gradients with respect to D_R. These modules are the primary carriers of the unwanted information.  

C. Targeted Module Unlearning  
Unlearning proceeds by neutralizing the selected adapters M. We explore two strategies:  
1. Zeroing Strategy: For i‚ààM, set Œ¥·µ¢‚Üê0.  
2. Gradient Subtraction: For i‚ààM, compute the average influence gradient ƒú·µ¢ and update  
   $$\delta·µ¢ \leftarrow \delta·µ¢ \;-\;\alpha\,\widehat G·µ¢,\quad \widehat G·µ¢=E_{(x,y)\in D_R}[‚àá_{\delta·µ¢}L(f(Œ∏_0,\delta),x,y)]$$  
   where Œ± is a step size tuned to maximize forgetting while controlling utility loss.  

D. Post-Deletion Fine-Tuning and Privacy Accounting  
After neutralization, we fine-tune the modified adapter set Œ¥‚Ä≤ only on the retained data D_remain=D‚àñD_R for T‚ÄÜ‚â™‚ÄÜ|D_remain| steps at learning rate Œ∑_small to recover any lost generalization. Because Œ¥ has low dimension and we only update a small subset, this overhead is <5% of full retraining.  

Differential Unlearning Guarantee  
To provide formal privacy assurances, we inject calibrated noise into the influence estimation and fine-tuning steps using a R√©nyi-DP accountant:  
1. Clip per-example gradients in adapter space to norm C.  
2. Add Gaussian noise ùí©(0,œÉ¬≤C¬≤I) to each aggregated gradient.  
3. Track the cumulative privacy loss (Œµ,Œ¥) over the unlearning pipeline.  

This yields (Œµ,Œ¥)-unlearning: the distribution of f after unlearning is provably close to the distribution had D_R never been used in training or fine-tuning.

Conclusion  
This proposal addresses a critical barrier in deploying trustworthy LLMs: how to efficiently and provably remove unwanted data influences without full model retraining. By combining PEFT with gradient-based influence estimation and differential unlearning techniques, we aim to deliver a practical, scalable, and formally grounded solution. Our experimental validation across multiple models, datasets, and privacy/utility trade-offs will establish new benchmarks and guide the community toward robust, compliant, and ethical large-scale AI.
