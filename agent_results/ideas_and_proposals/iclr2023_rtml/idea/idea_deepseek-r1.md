**Title:** Scalable Machine Unlearning via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models  

**Motivation:** Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive datasets risk memorizing sensitive or biased content, posing privacy and ethical risks. Retraining models from scratch to remove such data is computationally prohibitive, while existing machine unlearning methods lack scalability and precision. This research addresses the critical need for efficient, targeted unlearning in LLMs without sacrificing performance.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a framework that integrates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., LoRA, adapters) with gradient-based influence estimation to enable scalable machine unlearning. First, identify parameters most affected by target data subsets (e.g., toxic or private samples) using gradient tracing. Next, "freeze" core model weights and isolate data-specific influences into modular PEFT components. Unlearning is achieved by selectively removing or perturbing these modules, followed by lightweight fine-tuning on a purified dataset to preserve general knowledge. The approach aims to provide formal privacy guarantees (e.g., differential unlearning) while maintaining <5% computational overhead compared to full retraining. Expected outcomes include a benchmark for LLM unlearning efficacy and a toolkit to mitigate bias/privacy risks in deployed models, enabling compliance with regulations like GDPR.
