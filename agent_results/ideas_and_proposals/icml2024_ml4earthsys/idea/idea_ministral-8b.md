### Title: Enhancing Climate Projections with Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Subgrid Processes

### Motivation
Accurate climate projections are crucial for effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, numerical models struggle to capture subgrid processes due to computational limitations. Integrating machine learning, specifically physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), can bridge this gap by emulating these subgrid processes more efficiently. This research aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of climate models by leveraging the interpretability and physical consistency of PINNs.

### Main Idea
The proposed research will focus on developing PINNs to emulate subgrid processes in climate models. The methodology involves:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering high-resolution observational data and model outputs to train the PINNs.
2. **Model Design**: Constructing PINNs that incorporate physical laws and constraints to ensure the learned subgrid processes are physically consistent.
3. **Training**: Training the PINNs using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data.
4. **Validation**: Evaluating the performance of the PINNs through rigorous validation against independent datasets and comparing with traditional models.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved accuracy in simulating subgrid processes.
- Enhanced climate projections with reduced computational cost.
- Greater interpretability and physical consistency in climate models.

Potential impact:
- Enhanced ability to predict High Impact-Low Likelihood events.
- Better understanding and simulation of climate variability, such as El Ni√±o.
- More reliable and efficient climate models for decision-making in adaptation and mitigation strategies.
