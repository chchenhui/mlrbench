**Physics-Constrained Generative Models for Realistic High-Impact Climate Extremes: A Hybrid GAN-Diffusion Approach**  

---

### 1. Introduction  
**Background**  
Climate change poses existential risks to ecosystems and human societies, necessitating accurate projections of High Impact-Low Likelihood (HILL) events such as unprecedented heatwaves, floods, and hurricanes. Traditional numerical climate models, while interpretable, struggle to resolve subgrid-scale processes and undersample HILL events due to their rarity in observational datasets like ERA5. Machine learning (ML) offers promise in augmenting these models, particularly through generative approaches that synthesize physically plausible extreme events. However, existing generative models often lack explicit enforcement of physical laws, risking implausible outputs that undermine their utility for risk assessment and adaptation planning.  

**Research Objectives**  
This project aims to:  
1. Develop a hybrid physics-constrained generative model combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models to synthesize spatio-temporally coherent HILL events.  
2. Integrate physical laws (e.g., conservation of energy, mass balance) as soft constraints during training to ensure outputs adhere to Earth system physics.  
3. Quantify uncertainties in generated extremes and validate their utility in downstream tasks like impact modeling.  

**Significance**  
By generating physically consistent HILL scenarios, this work will:  
- Augment scarce training data for climate models and impact assessments.  
- Improve the representation of tail risks in climate projections.  
- Provide actionable insights for policymakers and adaptation planners.

### 2. Methodology  
**Research Design**  
The proposed framework combines a GAN-based architecture for adversarial training with diffusion models for iterative refinement, guided by physics-informed loss terms.  

#### **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
- **Datasets**: ERA5 reanalysis data (0.25° resolution), CMIP6 simulations, and regional climate model outputs.  
- **Target Variables**: Temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and sea-level pressure extremes.  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Normalize variables to zero mean and unit variance.  
  - Extract spatio-temporal patches (e.g., 64×64 grid cells over 5-day sequences).  
  - Apply extreme value theory (EVT) to identify threshold exceedances for HILL event labeling.  

#### **Model Architecture**  
1. **Hybrid GAN-Diffusion Framework**:  
   - **Generator ($G$)**: A U-Net with attention mechanisms to capture multi-scale spatio-temporal dependencies.  
   - **Diffusion Refiner ($D_{diff}$)**: A time-conditional diffusion model that iteratively denoises generated outputs while enforcing physics constraints.  
   - **Discriminator ($D_{adv}$)**: A 3D convolutional network assessing realism of generated sequences.  

2. **Physics-Informed Loss Functions**:  
   - **Adversarial Loss**:  
     $$L_{adv} = \mathbb{E}[\log D_{adv}(x)] + \mathbb{E}[\log(1 - D_{adv}(G(z)))]$$  
   - **Physics Regularization**:  
     $$L_{phy} = \lambda_1 \| \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} \|^2 + \lambda_2 \| \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \alpha \nabla^2 T \|^2$$  
    mathbf{u}$mathbf{u}$ is velocity, $T$ is temperature, and $\alpha$ is a diffusion coefficient.  
   - **Diffusion Loss**:  
     $$L_{diff} = \mathbb{E}_{t,\epsilon}\left[ \| \epsilon - D_{diff}(x_t, t) \|^2 \right]$$  
   - **Total Loss**:  
     $$L_{total} = L_{adv} + L_{phy} + L_{diff}$$  

#### **Training Protocol**  
1. **Phase 1**: Pretrain $G$ and $D_{adv}$ on ERA5 data using $L_{adv}$ and $L_{phy}$.  
2. **Phase 2**: Train $D_{diff}$ to refine outputs using CMIP6 data, incorporating $L_{diff}$ and physics constraints.  
3. **Phase 3**: Joint fine-tuning of all components with adaptive weighting of loss terms.  

#### **Experimental Validation**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against evtGAN (Boulaguiem et al., 2021), Physics-Informed GAN (Tretiak 2022), 2022), and NeuralGCM (Hoyer et al., 2024).  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Physical Consistency**: Energy conservation error, mass balance residual.  
  - **Statistical Accuracy**: Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), spatial correlation.  
  - **Extreme Value Metrics**: Return period analysis, tail dependence indices.  
- **Downstream Task**: Train flood risk models on augmented datasets; evaluate prediction accuracy against historical events.

2. **Scientific Impact**:  
   - A publicly available dataset of synthetic HILL events for community use.  
   - Improved representation of tail risks in CMIP7 and regional climate models.  

3. **Societal Impact**:  
   - Enhanced preparedness for extreme events through risk maps and adaptation guidelines.  
   - Support for UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on climate action (SDG13) and resilient infrastructure (SDG9).  

4. **Methodological Advancements**:  
   - Novel techniques for balancing adversarial training with physics constraints.  
   - Open-source code for physics-informed generative modeling in climate science.
