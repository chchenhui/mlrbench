**1. Title:** **SAILOR: Socially-Aligned Intrinsic Reward Learning via Multimodal Implicit Human Feedback**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
The proliferation of interactive systems, ranging from virtual assistants to collaborative robots, necessitates agents capable of learning effectively from and adapting to their human users. Current interactive machine learning paradigms often rely on explicit human feedback, such as demonstrations (Imitation Learning), corrective actions, or scalar rewards (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, RLHF) (Abramson et al., 2022; RLHF Overview, 2025). While valuable, these methods often require users to provide feedback in specific, sometimes unnatural formats, placing a significant burden on the human and potentially disrupting the flow of interaction. Furthermore, explicitly defining reward functions that capture the nuances of desired behavior, especially in complex social contexts, remains a formidable challenge (RLHF Overview, 2025).

Humans, however, naturally convey a wealth of information implicitly through multimodal channels during interaction. Facial expressions reveal emotional states like confusion or satisfaction, vocal prosody indicates urgency or approval, gaze patterns signal attention focus, and gestures provide directive or descriptive cues. These signals are rich, contextual, and often subconscious, yet they offer a powerful, continuous stream of information about human intent, preferences, and internal states. Existing systems largely fail to leverage this implicit feedback channel effectively. Preliminary work has explored implicit feedback, such as using EEG signals (Xu et al., 2020), but often focuses on single modalities or pre-defined signal interpretations (e.g., error potentials). Multimodal agent creation has progressed (DeepMind MIA, 2021), but often relies on imitation or self-supervision rather than learning reward functions directly from implicit feedback signals whose meaning is initially unknown.

A significant research gap exists in developing interactive agents that can learn to *interpret* these diverse, potentially ambiguous, and user-specific implicit signals *online* and use this interpretation to dynamically shape their behavior. This challenge aligns strongly with central questions posed by the Interactive Learning with Implicit Human Feedback workshop, particularly regarding learning from arbitrary feedback signals with initially unknown grounding, handling non-stationarity in human preferences and environments, and designing intrinsic reward systems for social alignment. Addressing this gap is crucial for creating truly adaptive, intuitive, and socially intelligent AI systems deployable in real-world settings like personalized education, assistive healthcare, and human-robot collaboration.

**2.2 Research Objectives**
This research proposes a novel framework, **S**ocially-**A**ligned **I**ntrinsic Reward **L**earning via Multim**o**dal Implicit Human Feedback (SAILOR), designed to enable agents to learn intrinsic reward functions dynamically by interpreting multimodal implicit feedback during interaction. The primary goal is to develop agents that can robustly infer human intent and preferences from naturalistic cues, leading to improved alignment and collaboration, without relying solely on pre-defined rewards or explicit feedback mechanisms.

The specific objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop a Multimodal Implicit Feedback Encoder:** To design and train a deep learning model, likely leveraging transformer architectures, capable of processing and fusing diverse, time-varying implicit feedback signals (e.g., speech prosody, facial expressions, gaze patterns, gestures) into a unified latent representation that captures the underlying communicative intent.
2.  **Formulate an Intrinsic Reward Inference Mechanism:** To devise a method, inspired by Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and preference-based learning principles, that learns a mapping from the latent feedback representation to an intrinsic reward signal. This mechanism must operate without *a priori* knowledge of the specific meaning of feedback cues, inferring their valence and relevance contextually.
3.  **Integrate Reward Learning with Meta-Reinforcement Learning:** To embed the learned intrinsic reward function within a meta-RL framework. This will allow the agent's policy and its reward interpretation model to rapidly adapt to individual user differences, non-stationary preferences, and evolving environmental dynamics, addressing the challenge of personalization and change over time (Lee et al., 2021).
4.  **Empirically Validate the SAILOR Framework:** To conduct rigorous experiments in simulated and/or human-subject settings comparing SAILOR against relevant baselines. Evaluation will focus on task performance, learning efficiency, adaptation capabilities, and the quality of human-agent interaction and alignment.

**2.3 Significance**
This research holds significant potential for both scientific advancement and practical application. Scientifically, it addresses fundamental challenges in interactive machine learning, HRI, and computational modeling of social intelligence. By enabling agents to learn from implicit, multimodal feedback with unknown semantics, SAILOR pushes beyond current RLHF limitations, offering a new paradigm for grounding communication and intent in interaction. It directly tackles key questions about interaction-grounded learning from arbitrary feedback and designing intrinsic rewards for alignment. Furthermore, investigating adaptation through meta-learning contributes to understanding how agents can cope with the inherent non-stationarity of human interaction.

Practically, the SAILOR framework could lead to AI systems that are significantly more intuitive, adaptive, and user-friendly. Potential applications include:
*   **Personalized Education:** AI tutors that adapt their teaching strategies based on detecting student confusion or engagement through facial expressions and vocal cues.
*   **Assistive Robotics:** Robots in healthcare or elder care that adjust their behavior based on subtle cues of comfort, distress, or preference from the user.
*   **Collaborative AI:** Teammates (human or AI) that better understand implicit instructions or feedback during complex tasks.
*   **Accessibility:** Interfaces that adapt to users with diverse communication abilities by learning their unique implicit feedback patterns.

By reducing the dependency on explicit feedback and hand-crafted rewards, SAILOR promises to enhance the scalability and applicability of interactive learning systems in complex, real-world social environments.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Research Design Overview**
The proposed research follows an iterative design and evaluation methodology. We will develop the SAILOR framework components—multimodal encoding, intrinsic reward inference, and meta-RL adaptation—and integrate them into an interactive learning loop. The agent, operating within a defined task environment, interacts with a human (initially simulated, later real participants). During interaction, the agent receives multimodal implicit feedback alongside state observations and performs actions based on its current policy. The feedback is processed by the SAILOR framework to update the intrinsic reward model, which in turn guides the policy updates via RL. Meta-learning facilitates adaptation across different interaction segments or users. The framework's performance will be evaluated against baseline methods through carefully designed experiments.

**3.2 Data Collection**
*   **Environment/Task:** We will initially use a simulated environment that facilitates rich interaction and allows for clear task goals and measurable performance. A potential candidate is a collaborative task environment (e.g., a variant of Overcooked or a simulated assembly task) where a human guides or collaborates with an AI agent. Another option is a simulated tutoring environment where an agent explains concepts and the human 'student' provides feedback. This allows controlled generation of task states, agent actions, and simulated 'implicit' feedback correlated with task progress or simulated user states (e.g., 'confusion' leading to certain facial expressions/prosody). Subsequently, we plan human-subject experiments using a similar task setup.
*   **Participants:** For human-subject studies, participants will be recruited following ethical guidelines (IRB approval obtained). Informed consent detailing data collection (video, audio, possibly eye-tracking) and usage will be secured. Data will be anonymized. Simulated users will be used for initial development and testing, parameterized to exhibit varying feedback styles and non-stationarity.
*   **Modalities & Sensors:** We aim to capture:
    *   **Visual:** Facial expressions (webcam -> OpenFace/Mediapipe for Action Units, landmarks), Gestures/Posture (webcam -> Pose estimation libraries).
    *   **Auditory:** Speech prosody (microphone -> Librosa/Praat for features like pitch, intensity, speech rate), potentially verbal content (ASR -> NLP features, though the focus is *implicit* cues).
    *   **Gaze:** Eye-tracking data (if specialized hardware is available, e.g., Tobii eye-tracker -> fixation points, saccades, dwell times).
    *   **Interaction Data:** Agent state ($s_t$), agent action ($a_t$), task performance metrics (e.g., score, completion time), environment state.
*   **Data Structure:** Data will be logged as time-series sequences of $(s_t, a_t, r^{\text{ext}}_t, \text{feedback}_t, s_{t+1})$, where $r^{\text{ext}}_t$ is any available external task reward (potentially sparse or zero) and $\text{feedback}_t$ is the collection of multimodal implicit signals captured at time $t$.

**3.3 Algorithmic Steps: The SAILOR Framework**

**Step 1: Multimodal Implicit Feedback Encoder**
*   **Objective:** To learn a joint latent representation $z_t$ from raw multimodal feedback signals $(\text{visual}_t, \text{audio}_t, \text{gaze}_t, ...)$.
*   **Architecture:** We propose a transformer-based model. Input streams from different modalities will first be processed by modality-specific encoders (e.g., CNNs for visual data, 1D CNNs or RNNs for audio/gaze sequences over short windows). The outputs are tokenized and fed into a cross-modal transformer encoder. Self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms will allow the model to weigh the importance of different signals and capture inter-modal dependencies.
    $$ z_t = \text{TransformerEncoder}(\text{Enc}_{\text{vis}}(\text{visual}_t), \text{Enc}_{\text{aud}}(\text{audio}_t), ...) $$
*   **Training:** The encoder can be pre-trained using self-supervised methods (e.g., multimodal contrastive learning on large unlabeled interaction datasets, masked modality prediction) to learn robust representations. It will be fine-tuned end-to-end within the SAILOR loop.

**Step 2: Intrinsic Reward Inference Module**
*   **Objective:** To learn an intrinsic reward function $R_\phi(s_t, a_t, z_{t+1})$ parameterized by $\phi$, which maps the latent feedback $z_{t+1}$ (received after state-action $(s_t, a_t)$) to a scalar reward signal $r^{\text{int}}_t$. This mapping should reflect the inferred user preference or intent conveyed by the implicit feedback.
*   **Approach:** We hypothesize that implicit feedback, while potentially ambiguous initially, carries information about the desirability of recent agent behavior. We will adapt preference-based learning techniques (inspired by RLHF/PEBBLE (Abramson et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2021)). Instead of explicit preference labels (A is better than B), we use the implicitly conveyed signals.
    *   **Bootstrapping:** Initially, we might use weak supervision: correlate feedback patterns $z_{t+1}$ with immediate changes in task success or objective metrics. Feedback associated with positive outcomes is weakly labeled positive, and vice versa.
    *   **Contrastive Preference Learning:** We can frame the learning of $R_\phi$ contrastively. Given pairs of interaction snippets $(s, a, z_{\text{feedback}})$ and $(s', a', z'_{\text{feedback}})$, if we have a weak signal or occasional explicit label indicating one led to a more positive user state than the other, we can train $R_\phi$ to assign higher rewards accordingly. For instance, using a Bradley-Terry model on inferred preferences:
        $$ P(\text{traj}_1 \succ \text{traj}_2) = \sigma \left( \sum_{t} R_\phi(s_{1,t}, a_{1,t}, z_{1, t+1}) - \sum_{t} R_\phi(s_{2,t}, a_{2,t}, z_{2, t+1}) \right) $$
        where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, and preferences $\succ$ might be elicited sparsely or inferred from task outcomes.
    *   **Reward Model:** $R_\phi$ itself can be a neural network (e.g., MLP) taking $s_t, a_t, z_{t+1}$ (or just $z_{t+1}$ conditioned on context $s_t, a_t$) as input.
    *   **Learning $\phi$:** Parameters $\phi$ are updated to maximize the likelihood of observed feedback patterns under the inferred preference model or to align predicted rewards with weak supervision signals.

**Step 3: Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Policy Adaptation**
*   **Objective:** To enable the agent's policy $\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)$ and the reward interpretation model $R_\phi$ to adapt quickly to individual users or changing interaction dynamics.
*   **Approach:** We will employ a meta-RL algorithm, such as MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) or its variants (e.g., Reptile, recurrent meta-RL).
    *   **Task Definition:** Each 'task' in the meta-learning framework corresponds to an interaction episode or a block of interaction with a specific user or under specific environmental conditions.
    *   **Meta-Training (Outer Loop):** The algorithm learns meta-parameters $(\theta_{\text{meta}}, \phi_{\text{meta}})$ across a distribution of tasks (different simulated users, different environmental variations). The objective is to find initial parameters that allow for fast adaptation within a new task. Update rule (MAML-style):
        $$ (\theta_{\text{meta}}, \phi_{\text{meta}}) \leftarrow (\theta_{\text{meta}}, \phi_{\text{meta}}) - \beta \nabla_{(\theta, \phi)} \sum_{\text{Task}_i} \mathcal{L}_{\text{Task}_i}(\theta'_i, \phi'_i) $$
        where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{Task}_i}$ is the loss on task $i$ after adaptation, and $(\theta'_i, \phi'_i)$ are adapted parameters.
    *   **Adaptation (Inner Loop):** When faced with a new task (e.g., new user), the agent starts with $(\theta_{\text{meta}}, \phi_{\text{meta}})$. It interacts for a short period, collecting data $(s, a, z, r^{\text{ext}})$. It updates its parameters using a few gradient steps based on the RL objective (using the currently estimated intrinsic reward $R_{\phi'}$) and potentially the reward model loss:
        $$ \phi'_i = \phi_{\text{meta}} - \alpha \nabla_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_{\text{Reward}}(\text{Data}_i; \phi_{\text{meta}}) $$
        $$ \theta'_i = \theta_{\text{meta}} - \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}}(\text{Data}_i; \pi_{\theta_{\text{meta}}}, R_{\phi'_i}) $$
        The RL loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}}$ would typically be derived from a standard RL algorithm (e.g., PPO, SAC) using the sum of external and learned intrinsic rewards: $r_t = r^{\text{ext}}_t + \lambda r^{\text{int}}_t = r^{\text{ext}}_t + \lambda R_{\phi'_i}(s_t, a_t, z_{t+1})$, where $\lambda$ is a weighting factor.
*   **Benefit:** This allows the agent to rapidly specialize its policy and its understanding of the *current* user's implicit feedback signals.

**3.4 Experimental Design**
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  RL Agent with only external rewards (if available).
    2.  RL Agent with hand-crafted intrinsic rewards (if feasible for the task).
    3.  Standard RLHF: Agent trained with explicit scalar feedback (e.g., simulated button presses correlated with implicit signals).
    4.  SAILOR (Single Modality): Ablated version using only one implicit modality (e.g., facial expressions).
    5.  SAILOR (No Meta-Learning): Proposed framework but without the meta-learning component (standard online learning).
    6.  PEBBLE (Lee et al., 2021): Adapted to use implicit feedback summaries as input for preference queries, if possible.
*   **Procedure:**
    *   **Simulation Experiments:** Evaluate learning speed, asymptotic performance, and adaptation to simulated changes (e.g., user model parameters shift, environment dynamics change).
    *   **Human-Subject Experiments:** Recruit participants to interact with the SAILOR agent and baseline agents in the chosen task. Use a within-subjects or between-subjects design. Collect objective performance data and subjective questionnaires post-interaction.
*   **Independent Variables:** Learning algorithm type (SAILOR vs. baselines), presence/absence of non-stationarity.
*   **Dependent Variables:**
    *   **Objective Metrics:** Task success rate, task completion time, learning curve (performance vs. interaction steps/time), cumulative reward (external + intrinsic if applicable). Adaptation time (time to recover performance after a shift).
    *   **Subjective Metrics (Human Studies):** User satisfaction ratings (e.g., Likert scales), perceived agent intelligence/understanding, perceived interaction naturalness, usability scores (e.g., SUS), trust ratings, cognitive load (e.g., NASA-TLX).
    *   **Analysis of Learned Representations/Rewards:** Qualitative analysis of the learned latent space $z_t$. Correlation analysis between the learned intrinsic reward $r^{\text{int}}_t$ and ground truth user states (if available in simulation) or human annotations of feedback valence.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**
1.  **A Novel Framework:** We expect to deliver the SAILOR framework as a concrete algorithmic contribution, demonstrating the feasibility of learning intrinsic rewards from multimodal implicit feedback without predefined semantics.
2.  **Improved Performance and Adaptation:** Empirical results are expected to show that SAILOR significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of task success, learning efficiency, and particularly adaptation speed to non-stationary human preferences and environmental changes in the chosen tasks.
3.  **Enhanced Human-Agent Interaction:** We anticipate subjective evaluations from human participants will indicate higher satisfaction, perceived understanding, and interaction naturalness when interacting with the SAILOR agent compared to baselines relying on explicit or no feedback.

Analysis of the learned reward function $R_\phi$ and latent space $z_t$ will shed light on the structure of implicit communication.
5.  **Demonstration of Meta-Learning Utility:** We expect to clearly demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of the meta-learning component for achieving rapid personalization and adaptation in realistic interactive scenarios.

**4.2 Impact**
The successful completion of this research will have a substantial impact:
*   **Scientific:** It will advance the state-of-the-art in interactive machine learning, reinforcement learning, and human-robot interaction by providing a new methodology for agents to learn from humans more naturally and effectively. It directly addresses core challenges highlighted by the workshop community regarding implicit feedback, reward learning, and adaptation. It offers a computational approach to grounding meaning in interaction.
*   **Technological:** SAILOR can pave the way for the development of more sophisticated, socially aware AI systems. Its principles could be integrated into various applications, including personalized educational software, assistive technologies for healthcare and accessibility (adapting to diverse users), collaborative robotics in manufacturing or exploration, and more engaging conversational agents and virtual characters.
*   **Societal:** By enabling AI systems to better understand and align with human users through natural, implicit cues, this research contributes towards building AI that is more helpful, less intrusive, and better integrated into human society. Reducing the need for explicit programming of rewards or feedback mechanisms can democratize AI development and deployment.

**Limitations and Future Work:** Potential challenges include the complexity of accurately capturing and processing noisy multimodal data in real-time, the inherent ambiguity of implicit signals, and ensuring the learned reward function is robust and safe. Future work could explore integrating explicit feedback alongside implicit signals, scaling the approach to more complex open-world environments, and conducting long-term deployment studies.
