# **Socially-Aligned Intrinsic Reward Learning via Multimodal Human Feedback**

## **1. Introduction**

### **Background**  
Interactive machine learning systems have become critical in domains like assistive robotics and personalized education, where agents must adapt to dynamic human preferences and environments. Current approaches, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely heavily on explicit scalar rewards or labeled demonstrations. However, these methods disregard the richness of *implicit* human feedback, which includes multimodal cues like speech tone, facial expressions, gestures, and eye movements. Such signals carry nuanced intent but require agents to interpret grounding without predefined semantics. For instance, a frustrated tone might imply a negative reward in a teaching task, while prolonged eye contact might indicate engagement. The challenge lies in leveraging these signals to learn intrinsic rewards in the absence of explicit labels, particularly in non-stationary environments where human preferences evolve over time.

### **Research Objectives**  
This project aims to develop **Socially-Aligned Intrinsic Reward Learning (SAIRL)**, a framework that addresses the following objectives:  
1. **Interpret Multimodal Implicit Feedback**: Learn intrinsic rewards from unstructured, context-dependent cues (e.g., gestures, facial expressions) without hand-crafted annotations.  
2. **Adapt to Non-Stationary Dynamics**: Enable rapid personalization to shifting human preferences and environmental changes via meta-learning.  
3. **Bridge Representation Gaps**: Integrate sequential latent reward inference (via inverse reinforcement learning) with contrastive learning over joint action-history embeddings.  

### **Significance**  
SAIRL has transformative potential for real-world applications:  
- **Assistive Robotics**: A healthcare assistant could adapt to a patient's pain levels using facial expressions.  
- **Education**: A tutoring system might detect confusion via speech tone and adjust its teaching strategy.  
- **Accessibility**: Interfaces could dynamically accommodate disabilities via gaze or gesture patterns.  
By reducing reliance on labeled rewards, SAIRL advances scalable AI systems that align with socially rich human intent.

## **2. Methodology**

### **2.1 Data Collection**  
#### **Task Domain**  
We focus on **interactive question-answering**, where a human user (e.g., a student) asks queries and a robot assistant provides answers under time constraints. This task mimics educational dialogues and requires rapid adaptation to preferences (e.g., “I need more examples” vs. “I want shorter answers”).

#### **Dataset Design**  
**Data Sources**:  
1. **Multimodal Interactions**:  
   - **Language**: Audio transcriptions of user-agent dialogues.  
   - **Audiovisual Signals**: Facial landmarks (via MediaPipe), EEG (emotional valence), and eye-tracking data.  
2. **Annotations**:  
   - **Implicit Feedback Labels**: Annotators rate each interaction on a 5-point frustration/confidence scale using video records.  
   - **Ground Truth Rewards**: Rare explicit feedback (e.g., “Good job!” or “That was unhelpful”) from task-completion metrics (e.g., answer accuracy).  

**Dataset Size**: We aim to collect 50,000 interactions across 200 human participants, with diverse cultural and educational backgrounds.

### **2.2 Model Architecture**  

#### **2.2.1 Multimodal Transformer Encoder**  
Let $ \mathcal{M} = \{\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{V}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{E}\} $ denote modalities (language, video, audio, EEG). Each modality is first encoded into sequences:  
- **Language**: $ \bm{x}_t^L \in \mathbb{R}^{d_L} $ (BERT-base).  
- **Video/Audio**: $ \bm{x}_t^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_V} $, $ \bm{x}_t^A \in \mathbb{R}^{d_A} $ (OpenFace 2.2 and OpenSMILE).  
- **EEG**: $ \bm{x}_t^E \in \mathbb{R}^{d_E} $ (NeuralEEGNet).  

A *modular transformer* aggregates features:  
$$
    \bm{h}_t^{joint} = \text{Transformer}(\bm{x}_t^L \oplus \bm{x}_t^V \oplus \bm{x}_t^A \oplus \bm{x}_t^E),
$$  
where $ \oplus $ denotes concatenation.  

#### **2.2.2 Intrinsic Reward Model**  
The latent $ \bm{h}_t^{joint} $ feeds into a reward head:  
$$
    r_t = \phi(\bm{h}_t^{joint}; \theta_r)
$$  
Here, $ \phi(\cdot) $ is a 2-layer MLP with ReLU activations. The reward function is learned **without explicit supervision**, using a contrastive loss over trajectory pairs.

### **2.3 Algorithm Steps**  

#### **Step 1: Contrastive Latent Reward Learning**  
We sample trajectory pairs $ (\tau_i, \tau_j) $ and compute reward scores $ \bar{r}_i, \bar{r}_j $. The contrastive loss encourages longer-term reward consistency:  
$$
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} = -\log \frac{e^{\bar{r}_i / \tau}}{e^{\bar{r}_i / \tau} + e^{\bar{r}_j / \tau}},
$$  
where $ \tau $ is a temperature hyperparameter. Here, $ \bar{r}_i = \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t r_t $ aggregates rewards over a trajectory $ \tau_i $ with discount factor $ \gamma $.  

This avoids the need for explicit preference labels by using **implicit comparisons** between trajectories (e.g., cases where EEG suggests higher engagement).  

#### **Step 2: Meta-Learning for Non-Stationary Adaptation**  
To adapt to evolving preferences, we train the agent to update $ \theta_r $ using few-shot examples. Let $ \eta = \{(\tau_1, y_1), \dots, (\tau_K, y_K)\} $ be a meta-batch. The inner-loop loss computes:  
$$
    \theta_r' = \theta_r - \alpha \nabla_{\theta_r} \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}}(\eta),
$$  
followed by an outer-loop update to maximize performance across all meta-batches.  

#### **Step 3: Policy Optimization**  
The learned reward $ r_t $ trains a policy $ \pi_{\phi}(a_t|s_t) $ via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), where $ s_t $ includes the agent’s observation and the history $ \tau_{0:t} $:  
$$
    \pi^* = \arg\max_{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi, r} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t r_t \right].
$$  

### **2.4 Experimental Design**  

#### **Baselines**  
1. **Explicit RLHF**: Hand-designed reward features + PPO.  
2. **PEBBLE (Lee et al., 2021)**: Human preference relabeling + pre-training.  
3. **Unimodal Controls**: Model variants using single modalities (speech-only, vision-only).  

#### **Evaluation Metrics**  
1. **Reward Quality**: Correlation between predicted $ \bar{r} $ and human frustration scores (Spearman’s $ \rho $).  
2. **Adaptation Speed**: Task success rate within the first 5 interactions after a preference shift (e.g., sudden increase in task difficulty).  
3. **Human Evaluation**: Post-interaction surveys measuring perceived responsiveness and ease-of-use (7-point Likert scales).  
4. **Computational Efficiency**: Training time vs. performance trade-off (FLOPs per reward accuracy).  

#### **Ablation Studies**  
- Impact of modalities (remove each modality and measure performance drops).  
- Effect of meta-learning depth (1 vs. 3 inner-loop updates).
