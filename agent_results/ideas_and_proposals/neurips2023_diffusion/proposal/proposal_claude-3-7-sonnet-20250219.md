# Injective Neural ODE-based Conditional Diffusion Models for Scalable Inversion and Precise Image Editing

## 1. Introduction

Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in image synthesis, editing, and restoration. These models operate by gradually adding noise to data through a forward process and then learning to reverse this process to generate samples. While diffusion models have shown impressive results across various domains, they face significant limitations when applied to inverse problems, particularly when exact reconstruction is required from corrupted or partial observations.

Current approaches to image inversion and editing using diffusion models typically rely on iterative optimization procedures or approximation-based methods. These approaches lack theoretical guarantees for exact inversion, often leading to sub-optimal results, especially in critical applications such as medical imaging, forensic reconstruction, or precision-demanding industrial applications. The inability to provide deterministic and mathematically exact inversions represents a fundamental limitation that inhibits the broader adoption of diffusion models in domains where fidelity and reliability are paramount.

Several recent works have attempted to address these challenges. For instance, ERDDCI (Dai et al., 2024) employs a Dual-Chain Inversion technique to achieve reversible diffusion, while EDICT (Wallace et al., 2022) introduces coupled transformations for exact diffusion inversion. Similarly, approaches using Bi-directional Integration Approximation (Zhang et al., 2023) and Negative-prompt Inversion (Miyake et al., 2023) have made strides toward improving inversion quality and efficiency. However, these methods still face limitations in terms of computational overhead, theoretical guarantees, or applicability across diverse corruption types.

This research proposes a novel framework that fundamentally reimagines the diffusion process through the lens of injectivity and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). By structuring the diffusion chain as a deterministic, injective Neural ODE with a Lipschitz-regularized score network, we ensure exact inversion from corrupted observations without relying on iterative optimization heuristics or approximations. Our approach bridges the gap between variational inference and deterministic inversion in diffusion models, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements.

The key objectives of this research are:

1. To develop a mathematically rigorous framework for injective diffusion models based on Neural ODEs that ensures exact invertibility.
2. To demonstrate the efficacy of this framework in solving inverse problems with corrupted observations, including scenarios with hollow gaps, noise masks, and blurred regions.
3. To enable precise, controllable image editing through deterministic reconstruction pathways that preserve global image coherence.
4. To provide theoretical guarantees of injectivity and stability in the diffusion process.
5. To demonstrate the scalability and computational efficiency of our approach for high-resolution images and complex editing tasks.

The significance of this research extends beyond theoretical advancements. By enabling exact inversion and precise editing, our approach has the potential to significantly impact fields such as medical imaging, where accurate reconstruction from partial observations is critical; forensic analysis, where reliable image restoration is essential; and computer-aided design, where precise control over generated content is necessary. Moreover, our work contributes to the broader understanding of diffusion models by establishing connections between continuous-time diffusion processes, Neural ODEs, and inverse problem solving.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed methodology combines injective Neural ODEs with Lipschitz-regularized score networks to create a conditional diffusion model framework that ensures exact invertibility while maintaining high generative quality. The overall approach consists of several key components, which we detail in this section.

### 2.1 Injective Neural ODE-based Diffusion Framework

Unlike traditional diffusion models that employ stochastic differential equations (SDEs), we formulate the diffusion process as a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) that preserves information through injectivity. Specifically, we define the forward process as:

$$\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = f_\theta(x(t), t), \quad t \in [0, T]$$

where $x(t)$ represents the state at time $t$, with $x(0)$ being the original image and $x(T)$ being the final noisy state. The function $f_\theta$ is parameterized by a neural network with parameters $\theta$.

To ensure injectivity, we construct $f_\theta$ using an architecture that satisfies the following condition:

$$\langle f_\theta(x_1, t) - f_\theta(x_2, t), x_1 - x_2 \rangle \geq \lambda\|x_1 - x_2\|^2$$

for some $\lambda > 0$ and all $x_1, x_2$ in the domain, which ensures that the forward mapping is injective. This can be achieved by imposing specific architectural constraints on the neural network, as detailed below.

### 2.2 Architecture Design for Injectivity

The architecture of $f_\theta$ is designed to maintain injectivity through a combination of residual connections and Lipschitz constraints:

$$f_\theta(x, t) = g_\theta(x, t) + h_\theta(t) \odot x$$

where $g_\theta$ is a neural network with a Lipschitz constant strictly less than a certain threshold, $h_\theta$ is a time-dependent scaling factor, and $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication. 

To enforce the Lipschitz constraint, we employ spectral normalization on the weights of $g_\theta$ and design $h_\theta(t)$ such that:

$$h_\theta(t) > -\lambda, \quad \forall t \in [0, T]$$

This ensures that small changes in the input lead to proportionally small changes in the output, preserving the injectivity property throughout the diffusion process.

### 2.3 Conditional Denoising Objective

To train our model, we introduce a conditional denoising objective that allows the model to handle corrupted observations. Given a clean image $x_0$ and a corrupted version $y$, we define a conditional distribution $p(x_0|y)$ and train our model to denoise from a noisy state back to the original image, conditioned on $y$.

The training objective is formulated as:

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, y, \epsilon} \left[ \| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, y, t) \|^2 \right]$$

where $\epsilon$ is sampled from a standard Gaussian distribution, $x_t$ is the state at time $t$ obtained by solving the forward ODE from $x_0$, and $\epsilon_\theta$ is a neural network that predicts the noise component.

### 2.4 Exact Inversion via ODE Integration

The key advantage of our approach is the ability to perform exact inversion by integrating the ODE in reverse:

$$\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = -f_\theta(x(t), t), \quad t \in [T, 0]$$

Because the forward process is injective, this reverse integration is guaranteed to recover the original image exactly, without requiring iterative optimization or approximation.

For numerical implementation, we use a high-order ODE solver (e.g., Dormand-Prince method) to ensure accurate integration:

$$x_{t-\Delta t} = x_t - \int_{t}^{t-\Delta t} f_\theta(x(s), s) ds$$

The inversion process starts from the corrupted observation $y$, which is first mapped to the latent space using the forward ODE, and then the reverse ODE is applied to reconstruct the original image.

### 2.5 Localized Editing in Latent Space

For image editing applications, we introduce a mechanism to perform localized edits in the latent space while maintaining global coherence. Given an image $x_0$ and an edit specification (e.g., a mask indicating the region to edit and the desired modification), we:

1. Compute the latent representation $x_T$ by solving the forward ODE.
2. Apply a localized modification to $x_T$ based on the edit specification:

$$x_T' = x_T + \mathcal{M} \odot \Delta$$

where $\mathcal{M}$ is a spatial mask and $\Delta$ is the edit vector.

3. Solve the reverse ODE starting from $x_T'$ to obtain the edited image $x_0'$.

This approach ensures that edits are applied precisely where desired while maintaining the structural integrity and realism of the image through the diffusion process.

### 2.6 Lipschitz-Regularized Score Network

To further enhance stability and ensure theoretical guarantees, we incorporate Lipschitz regularization into the score network. The score network $s_\theta(x, t)$ approximates the gradient of the log-density:

$$s_\theta(x, t) \approx \nabla_x \log p(x, t)$$

We enforce a Lipschitz constraint on $s_\theta$ by adding a regularization term to the training objective:

$$\mathcal{L}_{reg}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{x_1, x_2, t} \left[ \frac{\|s_\theta(x_1, t) - s_\theta(x_2, t)\|^2}{\|x_1 - x_2\|^2} \right]$$

This regularization ensures that the score network is stable and well-behaved, which is crucial for the invertibility of the diffusion process.
