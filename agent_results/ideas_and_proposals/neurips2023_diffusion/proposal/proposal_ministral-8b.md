Injective Neural ODE-based Conditional Diffusion Models for Scalable Inversion and Precise Image Editing

## 2. Introduction

### Background

Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in generative modeling, demonstrating remarkable success across various domains including image, video, audio, 3D synthesis, and scientific applications. The diffusion process, which involves gradually adding noise to data and then learning to reverse this process, has shown superior performance in generating high-quality samples. However, one of the critical challenges in these models is the exact inversion of corrupted observations, such as recovering original images from partial inputs or blurred regions. Traditional methods often rely on iterative, approximation-based optimization, which can be computationally expensive and may not guarantee fidelity and determinism.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to design an invertible diffusion architecture based on injective neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) that preserve information during the forward process. This approach aims to achieve exact inversion from corrupted observations without the need for iterative optimization. Additionally, the model will be trained on a conditional denoising objective, enabling precise and controllable image editing through deterministic reconstruction pathways. The research will focus on the following specific goals:

1. **Exact Inversion**: Develop a method that guarantees exact inversion of corrupted observations, ensuring high fidelity and determinism in reconstruction.
2. **Scalable Applications**: Extend the proposed model to handle high-resolution images and diverse corruption types without sacrificing performance or accuracy.
3. **Localized Editing**: Enable precise, localized edits while maintaining global image coherence by updating hidden diffusion states in targeted latent regions.
4. **Theoretical Guarantees**: Provide theoretical guarantees for injectivity and stability in the diffusion process, integrating Neural ODEs and Lipschitz-regularized score networks.

### Significance

This research has the potential to unify generative modeling and inverse problem-solving, making diffusion models more suitable for critical applications such as medical imaging, forensic reconstruction, and computer-aided design. By ensuring exact inversion and precise editing, the proposed method can significantly enhance the practicality and reliability of diffusion models in various fields.

## 3. Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed methodology involves designing an injective Neural ODE-based architecture for conditional diffusion models. The key components of the model include:

1. **Injective Neural ODEs**: The forward diffusion process is modeled as a deterministic, injective Neural ODE with a Lipschitz-regularized score network. This ensures information preservation and exact inversion.
2. **Conditional Denoising Objective**: The model is trained on a conditional denoising objective, where the Neural ODE maps corrupted inputs to noise, and inversion involves reversing the ODE trajectory.
3. **Localized Editing**: For image editing tasks, localized edits update hidden diffusion states in targeted latent regions, enabling geometrically coherent reconstructions.

### Data Collection

The dataset used for training and evaluation will consist of high-resolution images with various types of corruption, such as noise masks, hollow gaps, and blurred regions. The dataset will be curated to cover a wide range of image types and corruption patterns to ensure the scalability and robustness of the proposed method.

### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Forward Diffusion Process**:
   - Initialize a clean image \( x_0 \).
   - Apply a series of additive noise steps \( \epsilon_t \) to generate a noisy image \( x_t \).
   - Use a Lipschitz-regularized score network \( \nabla \log p(x_t | x_0) \) to predict the noise added at each step.

2. **Neural ODEs for Denoising**:
   - Define a Neural ODE \( \dot{x}_t = f(x_t, t) \) that models the denoising process.
   - Train the Neural ODE using a conditional denoising objective:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{denoise}} = \mathbb{E}_{x_0, t, \epsilon} \left[ \| \epsilon - \nabla \log p(x_t | x_0) \|^2 \right]
     \]
   - Ensure the Lipschitz regularization of the score network to maintain stability and invertibility.

3. **Inversion Process**:
   - Given a corrupted image \( x_T \), reverse the diffusion process using the Neural ODE to obtain the original image \( x_0 \):
     \[
     x_{t-1} = \mathcal{O}(x_t, t)
     \]
   - Repeat the process until \( x_0 \) is reconstructed.

4. **Localized Editing**:
   - For image editing tasks, update the hidden diffusion states in targeted latent regions by applying localized edits to the noisy image \( x_t \).
   - Reverse the diffusion process to obtain the edited image \( x_0' \):
     \[
     x_0' = \mathcal{O}(x_t', t)
     \]

### Evaluation Metrics

The proposed method will be evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Inversion Accuracy**: Measure the fidelity of the reconstructed images compared to the ground truth using metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).
2. **Editing Quality**: Evaluate the quality of the edited images by comparing them to human judgments or ground truth edited images using metrics such as SSIM and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Assess the computational efficiency of the method by measuring the time taken for inversion and editing tasks.
4. **Theoretical Guarantees**: Verify the injectivity and stability of the diffusion process through theoretical analysis and empirical validation.
