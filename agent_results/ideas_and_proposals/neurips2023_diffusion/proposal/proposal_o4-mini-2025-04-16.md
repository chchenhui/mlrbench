Title  
Injective Neural ODE‐Based Conditional Diffusion for Deterministic Inversion and Fine‐Grained Image Editing  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Over the last three years, diffusion models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for high‐fidelity generative modeling in vision, audio and scientific domains. In the score‐based/SDE framework [Song & Ermon, 2020], a data sample $x_0$ is gradually corrupted by a diffusion (forward) process  
$$
d x = f(x,t)\,dt + g(t)\,dW_t,\quad x(0)=x_0,
$$  
and a learned score network $s_\theta(x,t)\approx\nabla_x\log p_t(x)$ is used to reverse this corruption via a generative SDE or its probability‐flow ODE. Despite spectacular results in unconditional and conditional generation, these stochastic reversals lack a deterministic, exact inversion pathway from an observed corrupted $y$ back to its original $x_0$. Most inversion methods—e.g. optimization‐based PDE inversion, two‐chain approximate inverses [Dai et al., 2024], Negative‐Prompt Inversion [Miyake et al., 2023]—rely on heuristics, local linearizations or bi‐directional integrators that can compromise reconstruction fidelity, slow down inference and provide no theoretical injectivity guarantees.  

Research Objectives  
We propose to design a *fully injective* diffusion architecture that (1) guarantees exact inversion of corrupted observations without iterative optimization, (2) scales to high resolutions and diverse corruption types, and (3) supports fine‐grained *localized* editing in a single deterministic framework. We achieve these goals by:  
1. Modeling the forward diffusion chain as a time‐dependent *injective* Neural ODE with explicit Lipschitz regularization, ensuring a bijective mapping between $x_0$ and its latent state $z_T$.  
2. Training a conditional score network $s_\theta(x,t\,|\,y)$ under a denoising objective that respects the injective flow, so that inversion is simply the reverse ODE.  
3. Introducing a localized‐latent‐manipulation protocol that edits target regions in latent space and then inverts back exactly, yielding geometrically coherent, high‐fidelity edits.  

Significance  
An injective, deterministic inversion mechanism would unify generative modeling and inverse‐problem‐solving, enabling precise reconstructions in critical domains (medical imaging, remote sensing, forensics) where fidelity and repeatability are paramount. Moreover, a single model supporting both inversion and editing would dramatically streamline user workflows in art, design and scientific visualization. The theoretical injectivity guarantee sets a new standard for reliability in diffusion‐based inversion.  

2. Methodology  

2.1 Overview of the Proposed Architecture  
Our architecture consists of three key components:  
A. **Injective Neural ODE Flow** $\Phi_t$: a differential mapping $\Phi_t:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d$ solving  
$$
\frac{d x}{dt}=f_\phi(x,t),\qquad x(0)=x_0,
$$  
where $f_\phi$ is parameterized by a residual network with spectral‐norm constraints enforcing $\|f_\phi(x,t)-f_\phi(y,t)\|\le L\|x-y\|$. This Lipschitz bound ensures $\Phi_t$ is bijective for each $t\in[0,T]$ [Grathwohl et al., 2018]. We define $z_T:=\Phi_T(x_0)$ as the latent code.  

B. **Noise Injection and Conditional Score Network**  
Unlike pure Neural ODEs, diffusion requires stochasticity to match the marginal distributions $p_t(x)$. We interleave small Gaussian noise steps between ODE blocks. Concretely, for $k=0,\dots,K-1$:  
1. ODE‐flow step: $x_{t_{k+1}}^- = \Phi_{t_{k+1}-t_k}(x_{t_k})$.  
2. Noise injection: $x_{t_{k+1}} = x_{t_{k+1}}^- + \sigma(t_{k+1}) \,\epsilon_k,\quad \epsilon_k\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)$.  

The conditional score network $s_\theta(x,t\,|\,y)$ approximates $\nabla_x\log p_t(x\,|\,y)$.  

C. **Exact Reverse ODE Inversion**  
Given $y$ (a corrupted or partially observed version of $x_0$), we encode $y$ by solving the forward ODE and noise schedule to get $z_T^y=\Phi_T(y)$ plus its injected noise path (which is known since we do not re‐sample at inference time). We then integrate the probability‐flow ODE backward:  
$$
\frac{d x}{dt}=-f_\phi(x,t)-\frac12 g^2(t)\,s_\theta(x,t\,|\,y),
$$  
from $t=T$ down to $t=0$, recovering $x_0$ exactly up to numerical integration error. No gradient‐based optimization is required.  

2.2 Training Objective  
We train $\{f_\phi,s_\theta\}$ jointly to minimize a conditional denoising score matching loss:  
$$
L(\phi,\theta)=\mathbb{E}_{x_0,y,t,\epsilon}\Big[\Big\|s_\theta\big(x_t,t\,\big|\,y\big)\;-\;\nabla_{x_t}\log q(x_t\mid x_0)\Big\|^2\Big]\;+\;\lambda\mathcal{R}_{\text{Lip}}(\phi),
$$  
where  
- $x_t$ is obtained by the forward ODE step plus noise injection at time $t$.  
- $q(x_t\mid x_0)$ is the known Gaussian corruption kernel.  
- $\mathcal{R}_{\text{Lip}}(\phi)=\sum_{W\in\phi}\big[\sigma_{\max}(W)-L\big]_+^2$ penalizes spectral norms above a target $L$.  

In practice we discretize $t\in\{t_k\}$, use standard AdamW optimization, and anneal $\lambda$ to enforce tight Lipschitz bounds.  

2.3 Localized Latent Editing Protocol  
To perform a region‐specific edit (mask $M\in\{0,1\}^{H\times W}$, edit specification $e$), we:  
1. Invert $y=x_0\odot(1-M)$ (zero‐filled) to latent $z_T=\Phi_T(y)$.  
2. Extract the latent feature map $h_T$ corresponding to mask $M$ (via the Jacobian pull‐back $\nabla_{x_0}\Phi_T$).  
3. Modify $h_T' = h_T + \Delta(e)$, where $\Delta(e)$ is a small learned perturbation (e.g. color shift, text embedding).  
4. Re‐assemble $z_T' = z_T\odot(1-M)+h_T'\odot M$, and integrate the reverse ODE to $t=0$, yielding $x_0^{\text{edited}}$.  

Because $\Phi_T$ is bijective and $s_\theta$ is trained conditionally, this pipeline yields *exact*, globally coherent edits with strict adherence to the local mask.  

2.4 Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate that our Injective Neural ODE‐Conditional Diffusion model will:  
1. **Achieve True One‐Shot Inversion**  
   – Zero‐optimization inversion with PSNR gains of 1–2 dB over ERDDCI and BDIA under both inpainting and deblurring scenarios.  
2. **Enable Precise, Artifact‐Free Localized Edits**  
   – User‐study preference > 85% for geometric fidelity and coherence compared to EDICT and Negative‐Prompt Inversion.  
3. **Provide Theoretical Injectivity Guarantees**  
   – Empirical Jacobian‐determinant checks will confirm non‐degeneracy along learned trajectories.  
   – Lipschitz‐bounds hold throughout training, ensuring $\Phi_t$ remains invertible.  
4. **Offer Competitive Efficiency**  
   – One reverse‐ODE pass (≈ 20 function evaluations) vs. multi‐pass or iterative gradient‐based inversions in baselines.  

Impact on the Field  
By unifying deterministic invertibility, conditional generation and localized editing in a single injective framework, this work will:  
– Lower the barrier for trustworthy diffusion‐based inversion in high‐stakes domains (e.g. medical diagnostics, forensic imagery).  
– Inspire new research on injective architectures and theoretically grounded score models.  
– Provide an extensible platform for future tasks: 3D shape editing, video inversion/editing, and scientific inverse problems (e.g. PDE‐based recovery).  

4. Conclusion and Future Directions  
We have outlined a research plan to build the first fully injective, conditional diffusion model based on Neural ODE flows with provable invertibility. Our approach promises exact inversion, efficient inference and fine‐grained editing, addressing key challenges in current diffusion‐based inversion methods. Future work will extend this framework to:  
– **Spatio‐temporal Domains**: Video inversion and editing via space‐time Neural SDE/ODE flows.  
– **Multimodal Conditioning**: Text‐guided edits using cross‐attention in $s_\theta(x,t\,|\,y,e_{\text{text}})$.  
– **Theoretical Analysis**: Rigorous bounds on integration error, stability under adversarial corruptions.  

By bridging generative modeling and inverse‐problem theory, we set a roadmap for the next generation of diffusion models—deterministic, invertible, and fully controllable.
