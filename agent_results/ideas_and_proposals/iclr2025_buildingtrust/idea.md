**Title:** Self-Correcting Language Models: Automated Error Detection and Correction for Enhanced Trustworthiness  

**Motivation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate plausible but factually incorrect or inconsistent outputs, eroding user trust in critical applications like healthcare or legal advice. Current approaches rely on post-hoc human verification, which is inefficient and unscalable. Automating error detection and correction within LLMs is essential to ensure reliability without sacrificing usability.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a framework where LLMs iteratively detect and correct errors in their outputs. The methodology integrates two components: (1) an *internal confidence scorer* that identifies low-confidence spans in generated text (e.g., factual claims, logical inconsistencies) using self-attention patterns and uncertainty quantification, and (2) a *retrieval-augmented corrector* that queries verified knowledge bases to refine errors. The model generates an initial response, flags uncertain segments, and revises them using retrieved evidence until confidence thresholds are met. Experiments will measure error reduction in benchmarks like TruthfulQA and FEVER, while evaluating computational overhead. Expected outcomes include a deployable system that reduces hallucination rates by 30â€“50% in high-stakes domains, balancing accuracy and latency. This approach could transform LLMs into self-improving systems, fostering trust in real-world applications.
