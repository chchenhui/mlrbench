**Title:** Dynamic Bias Trajectories in Human-AI Coevolution: Modeling and Mitigation in High-Stakes Decision Systems  

**Motivation:** Current AI bias mitigation methods focus on static snapshots of human-AI interaction, neglecting feedback loops where both human behaviors and AI adapt over time. This gap is critical in domains like criminal justice or healthcare, where coevolutionary dynamics risk amplifying biases, perpetuating systemic inequities.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a computational framework to model and dynamically mitigate bias in HAIC systems. Using agent-based simulations and reinforcement learning, simulate iterated human-AI interactions (e.g., judges and recidivism prediction tools) where agents coadapt. Track bias propagation via metrics like disparity amplification rates and fairness-utility tradeoffs. Integrate adaptive debiasing algorithms that update based on real-time interactions, employing counterfactual reasoning and preference-aware RLHF to correct emergent biases. Validate the framework on historical criminal justice datasets and participatory simulations with legal experts. Expected outcomes include a methodology to predict bias trajectories in HAIC and deploy context-sensitive interventions. This work would advance ethical AI by addressing temporal bias shifts, offering policymakers tools to audit and adapt systems in socially impactful domains.
