### Title: Adaptive Experimental Design for Efficient Drug Discovery

### Motivation
The field of drug discovery is a prime example where experimental design and active learning can significantly impact outcomes. The high cost and time-consuming nature of drug development necessitate intelligent and efficient data collection strategies. Traditional methods often result in redundant or inefficient experiments, leading to prolonged development cycles and increased costs. This research aims to develop adaptive experimental design methods that can optimize data collection processes, enhancing the efficiency and efficacy of drug discovery.

### Main Idea
The proposed research focuses on developing a framework for adaptive experimental design in drug discovery, leveraging active learning techniques. The framework will integrate domain knowledge from chemistry and biology to guide experimental decisions. By employing Bayesian optimization and contextual bandits, the system will iteratively select the most informative experiments to perform, reducing redundancy and enhancing the learning process. The methodology involves:

1. **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Incorporate chemical and biological properties to inform experimental designs.
2. **Bayesian Optimization**: Use Bayesian models to predict the most promising compounds or conditions to test next.
3. **Active Learning**: Continuously update the model based on experimental results, refining the experimental design in real-time.
4. **Scalability**: Ensure the framework can handle large-scale datasets and high-dimensional spaces.

Expected outcomes include a significant reduction in the number of experiments required to identify promising drug candidates, leading to faster and more cost-effective drug discovery processes. The potential impact is substantial, accelerating the development of life-saving medications and improving patient outcomes. Additionally, the framework can be extended to other high-impact applications such as materials design and computational biology.
