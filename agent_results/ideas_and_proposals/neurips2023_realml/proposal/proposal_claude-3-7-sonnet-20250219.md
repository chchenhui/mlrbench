# Physics-Guided Active Learning Framework with Adaptive Constraint Integration for Materials Discovery

## 1. Introduction

Materials discovery is a cornerstone of technological innovation, enabling advancements across sectors from energy storage to healthcare. However, traditional materials discovery approaches rely heavily on extensive experimentation or computationally intensive simulations. These methods are prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, creating a bottleneck in the development of novel materials with desired properties. The challenge lies in efficiently navigating the vast design space of potential materials compositions and structures to identify candidates that not only possess optimal target properties but also satisfy fundamental physical principles that govern material stability and synthesizability.

Machine learning approaches, particularly active learning methods, have emerged as promising tools to accelerate this discovery process by intelligently guiding experimental or computational resources toward the most informative candidates. Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been particularly successful in this domain, providing a principled framework for sequential, sample-efficient exploration of complex design spaces. However, a critical limitation of conventional BO approaches is their tendency to explore regions of the design space that violate physical laws or practical constraints, leading to wasted experimental resources on implausible or impossible-to-synthesize materials.

Recent works have begun addressing this limitation. Smith et al. (2023) introduced physics-informed BO for materials discovery, while Kim et al. (2023) developed constrained Gaussian Processes that incorporate physical knowledge. Patel et al. (2023) and Brown et al. (2023) further explored integrating physical laws into active learning frameworks. Despite these advances, significant challenges remain in efficiently representing complex physical constraints, balancing exploration with exploitation, and maintaining computational tractability while incorporating domain knowledge.

This research proposes a novel Physics-Guided Active Learning Framework with Adaptive Constraint Integration (PGAL-ACI) that addresses these challenges by:

1. Developing a hybrid surrogate modeling approach that combines physics-informed Gaussian Processes with specialized constraint handling mechanisms
2. Designing an adaptive acquisition function that dynamically balances physical constraint satisfaction with exploration objectives
3. Implementing an incremental constraint learning component that refines constraint representations based on experimental feedback
4. Creating a multi-fidelity optimization strategy that leverages both low-cost approximate simulations and high-fidelity experiments

The proposed framework aims to significantly accelerate materials discovery by focusing experimental resources on physically viable candidates while maintaining the flexibility to explore promising regions that may challenge conventional understanding. By reducing the number of experiments needed to discover novel materials, this research has the potential to dramatically decrease the time and cost of materials innovation, with applications spanning energy storage materials, catalysts, structural materials, and pharmaceutical compounds.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

We formulate the materials discovery problem as finding the material composition and structure $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ that maximizes a desired property $f(\mathbf{x})$, subject to physical constraints. Formally:

$$\max_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}} f(\mathbf{x}) \quad \text{subject to} \quad g_i(\mathbf{x}) \leq 0, \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots, m$$

where $f(\mathbf{x})$ is the objective function representing the material property of interest (e.g., catalytic activity, conductivity, strength), and $g_i(\mathbf{x}) \leq 0$ represents the $i$-th physical constraint (e.g., thermodynamic stability, charge neutrality, synthesis feasibility).

The key challenge is that evaluating $f(\mathbf{x})$ requires expensive experiments or simulations, while the constraints $g_i(\mathbf{x})$ may be known from physical principles or may need to be learned from data.

### 2.2 Physics-Guided Surrogate Model

We develop a novel hybrid surrogate modeling approach that combines Gaussian Processes (GPs) with physics-informed components to predict material properties while respecting physical constraints.

#### 2.2.1 Physically Consistent Kernel Design

We design physically consistent kernels for the GP that encode domain knowledge about the underlying structure of the material property landscape:

$$k(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = k_{\text{base}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') \cdot k_{\text{phys}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}')$$

where $k_{\text{base}}$ is a standard kernel (e.g., Mat√©rn or RBF) and $k_{\text{phys}}$ is a physics-informed kernel that encodes specific physical principles. For example, to enforce periodic behavior in crystalline materials:

$$k_{\text{phys}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = \exp\left(-\frac{2\sin^2(\pi\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'\|_2/p)}{l^2}\right)$$

where $p$ is the periodicity parameter and $l$ is the length scale.

#### 2.2.2 Constraint Representation

We model each physical constraint $g_i(\mathbf{x})$ using a separate GP:

$$g_i(\mathbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m_i(\mathbf{x}), k_i(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}'))$$

where $m_i(\mathbf{x})$ is a physics-informed mean function derived from domain knowledge. For known physical laws (e.g., thermodynamic stability), we directly incorporate the mathematical expression. For example, for thermodynamic stability:

$$m_{\text{stability}}(\mathbf{x}) = E_{\text{formation}}(\mathbf{x}) - \sum_j w_j E_j$$

where $E_{\text{formation}}$ is the formation energy, $E_j$ are energies of constituent elements, and $w_j$ are their molar fractions.

### 2.3 Adaptive Constraint-Aware Acquisition Function

We develop a novel acquisition function that explicitly accounts for physical constraints while balancing exploration and exploitation:

$$\alpha(\mathbf{x}) = EI(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \prod_{i=1}^m \Phi\left(\frac{-\mu_{g_i}(\mathbf{x})}{\sigma_{g_i}(\mathbf{x})}\right)^{\beta_i(t)}$$

where $EI(\mathbf{x})$ is the standard Expected Improvement function:

$$EI(\mathbf{x}) = (\mu_f(\mathbf{x}) - f(\mathbf{x}^+)) \Phi\left(\frac{\mu_f(\mathbf{x}) - f(\mathbf{x}^+)}{\sigma_f(\mathbf{x})}\right) + \sigma_f(\mathbf{x}) \phi\left(\frac{\mu_f(\mathbf{x}) - f(\mathbf{x}^+)}{\sigma_f(\mathbf{x})}\right)$$

$\mu_{g_i}(\mathbf{x})$ and $\sigma_{g_i}(\mathbf{x})$ are the posterior mean and standard deviation of the $i$-th constraint GP, $\Phi$ is the standard normal CDF, and $\beta_i(t)$ is an adaptive parameter controlling the strictness of the $i$-th constraint at iteration $t$.

The adaptive parameter $\beta_i(t)$ evolves according to:

$$\beta_i(t) = \beta_i(0) + \gamma_i \cdot \frac{n_{\text{violation},i}}{n_{\text{total}}}$$

where $n_{\text{violation},i}$ is the number of constraint violations observed for constraint $i$, $n_{\text{total}}$ is the total number of evaluated samples, and $\gamma_i$ is a scaling factor.

### 2.4 Incremental Constraint Learning

To handle initially unknown or partially known constraints, we implement an incremental constraint learning mechanism:

1. For each evaluated material $\mathbf{x}_j$, collect binary feedback on constraint satisfaction: $y_{i,j} = \mathbb{I}[g_i(\mathbf{x}_j) \leq 0]$

2. Update the constraint GPs using this feedback:
   $$p(g_i(\mathbf{x}) | \mathcal{D}_i) \propto p(g_i(\mathbf{x})) \prod_{j=1}^n p(y_{i,j} | g_i(\mathbf{x}_j))$$

3. For binary feedback, use a probit likelihood:
   $$p(y_{i,j}=1 | g_i(\mathbf{x}_j)) = \Phi(-g_i(\mathbf{x}_j))$$

This allows the model to progressively refine its understanding of the constraints as more experimental data becomes available.

### 2.5 Multi-Fidelity Optimization Strategy

To leverage both low-cost approximate simulations and high-fidelity experiments, we implement a multi-fidelity optimization strategy:

1. Define a hierarchy of fidelity levels $\{f_1, f_2, ..., f_L\}$ where $f_1$ represents low-fidelity simulations and $f_L$ represents high-fidelity experiments

2. Model the relationship between fidelity levels using a multi-fidelity GP:
   $$f_l(\mathbf{x}) = \rho_{l-1,l}(\mathbf{x}) f_{l-1}(\mathbf{x}) + \delta_l(\mathbf{x})$$
   where $\rho_{l-1,l}$ is a scaling function and $\delta_l \sim \mathcal{GP}(0, k_{\delta_l})$ is a GP capturing the difference

3. Extend the acquisition function to incorporate the cost-benefit trade-off:
   $$\alpha_{\text{MF}}(\mathbf{x}, l) = \frac{\alpha(\mathbf{x}, l)}{c(l)^{\gamma}}$$
   where $c(l)$ is the cost of evaluation at fidelity level $l$ and $\gamma$ is a parameter controlling the cost sensitivity

### 2.6 Experimental Design

We will validate the PGAL-ACI framework on three materials discovery tasks of increasing complexity:

1. **Benchmark Task**: Perovskite materials for solar cells optimization, where the objective is to maximize power conversion efficiency subject to stability constraints
   - Dataset: Use existing perovskite stability and efficiency data from Materials Project
   - Constraints: Phase stability, toxicity, band gap constraints

2. **Medium Complexity Task**: Discovery of novel thermoelectric materials
   - Objective: Maximize figure of merit ZT
   - Constraints: Thermal stability, mechanical stability, element abundance

3. **High Complexity Task**: Design of heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 reduction
   - Objective: Maximize catalytic activity and selectivity
   - Constraints: Surface stability, poison resistance, cost limitations

For each task, we will follow this experimental protocol:

1. Split available data into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets
2. Initialize surrogate models using training data
3. Run active learning for 100 iterations
4. For each iteration:
   - Select next point using the acquisition function
   - Evaluate the objective and constraints (using oracle/simulator)
   - Update all models with new data
   - Report cumulative regret and constraint violation rate

### 2.7 Evaluation Metrics

We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of our method:

1. **Simple Regret**: $r_T = f(\mathbf{x}^*) - \max_{t=1,...,T} f(\mathbf{x}_t)$ where $\mathbf{x}^*$ is the true optimum
2. **Constraint Satisfaction Rate**: Percentage of suggested candidates that satisfy all constraints
3. **Sample Efficiency**: Number of experiments required to reach within 5% of the optimal value
4. **Computational Efficiency**: Time required per iteration
5. **Benchmark Comparison**: Performance relative to standard BO, random search, and other physics-informed methods

### 2.8 Baselines

We will compare our PGAL-ACI framework against the following baselines:

1. Standard Bayesian Optimization (BO)
2. Random search
3. Physics-informed BO (Smith et al., 2023)
4. Constrained Gaussian Processes (Kim et al., 2023)
5. Active learning with physical constraints (Patel et al., 2023)
6. Multi-fidelity BO with physical constraints (Adams et al., 2023)

### 3.3 Long-term Vision

In the long term, this research aims to establish a new paradigm for scientific discovery that seamlessly integrates physical knowledge with data-driven exploration. By developing systems that respect fundamental scientific principles while efficiently exploring the unknown, we envision enabling "autonomous scientists" that can accelerate discovery across multiple disciplines. The physics-guided active learning approach developed here represents a crucial step toward this vision, demonstrating how machine learning can work in harmony with scientific domain knowledge to push the boundaries of what is possible in materials discovery and beyond.
