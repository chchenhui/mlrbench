**Key Challenges:**

1. **Modeling Complex Physical Constraints**: Accurately representing intricate physical laws and constraints within machine learning models remains a significant challenge, as oversimplification can lead to unrealistic predictions.

2. **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation**: In active learning, effectively balancing the exploration of new design spaces with the exploitation of known promising regions is crucial for efficient materials discovery.

3. **Data Scarcity and Quality**: Limited availability of high-quality experimental data can hinder the training of robust models, especially when integrating complex physical constraints.
