# Sim2Act: Self-Supervised Action Data Generation for Multi-Modal Foundation Models in Decision Making

## Introduction

Foundation models have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence by demonstrating remarkable capabilities in vision and language understanding through pretraining on vast and diverse datasets. These models have shown exceptional zero-shot and few-shot transfer capabilities across various downstream tasks, ranging from image recognition to natural language understanding. However, a critical limitation emerges when deploying these models in domains requiring sequential decision-making: foundation models lack action-conditioned data in their training regimes. This absence creates a fundamental disconnect between their strong perceptual and linguistic capabilities and their ability to act—to select appropriate actions based on observations and goals.

Sequential decision-making tasks, which form the core of applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive dialogue systems, have traditionally been addressed through reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and planning methods. These approaches typically learn task-specific policies from scratch, which, while effective for targeted applications, often lack the broad world knowledge and generalization capabilities of foundation models. Despite significant advances in domains like game playing and robotic control, traditional decision-making algorithms remain sample-inefficient and struggle with generalization across diverse tasks.

The research community has begun exploring the intersection of foundation models and sequential decision-making, with emerging work on adapting language models to interact with external tools, using vision-language models as perception components in embodied agents, and optimizing dialogue agents through reinforcement learning with human feedback. However, these approaches often rely on task-specific fine-tuning or specialized architectures that fail to fully leverage the rich representation capabilities of foundation models across the perception-action loop.

The fundamental challenge lies in the "actions gap"—foundation models excel at understanding what they observe and read but struggle to decide what to do in response. This gap stems from the lack of action-conditioned data in the pretraining corpora of foundation models, which predominantly consist of observation-only or text-only datasets without corresponding action labels.

This research proposal introduces Sim2Act, a novel framework for self-supervised generation of action-conditioned data to bridge this critical gap. By leveraging diverse simulated environments to automatically generate large-scale, multi-modal datasets consisting of observations, language descriptions, and corresponding actions, Sim2Act aims to enhance foundation models with action prediction capabilities. Our approach will enable more efficient transfer of foundation model capabilities to sequential decision-making tasks while maintaining their generalization advantages.

The significance of this research is threefold:
1. It addresses a fundamental limitation in current foundation models by incorporating action understanding and prediction into their capability repertoire.
2. It proposes a scalable, self-supervised approach to generate the large volumes of action-labeled data needed to train such models without expensive human annotation.
3. It creates a pathway to deploy foundation models in real-world control and decision-making scenarios with improved sample efficiency and generalization capabilities.

## Methodology

### Overview

The Sim2Act framework consists of four main components: (1) a diverse collection of simulated environments, (2) a language-conditioned exploration module, (3) a data collection and filtering pipeline, and (4) a multi-modal foundation model with action prediction capabilities. These components work together in an iterative, bootstrapping process to generate increasingly complex action-conditioned data and improve the model's decision-making capabilities.

### 1. Simulated Environment Collection

We will curate and integrate a diverse set of simulated environments spanning different domains:

- **Navigation environments**: AI2-THOR, Habitat, ViZDoom
- **Object manipulation environments**: MuJoCo, PyBullet, RLBench
- **Multi-agent interaction environments**: Overcooked, Melting Pot
- **Task-oriented dialogue environments**: TextWorld, ALFWorld

Each environment will be wrapped with a standardized API that accepts natural language task descriptions and returns observations in a consistent format (RGB images, state vectors, text observations). The environments will be configured to support curriculum learning, with varying levels of task complexity.

### 2. Language-Conditioned Exploration

For each environment, we will define a task distribution $p(T)$ from which we sample natural language task descriptions $t \sim p(T)$. Task descriptions will range from simple instructions ("Pick up the red cube") to complex goals ("Prepare a meal by finding ingredients in the kitchen, cooking them, and serving them on a plate").

Given a task description $t$, we employ a base foundation model $F_{\text{base}}$ (e.g., a vision-language model like CLIP or a large language model like GPT-4) to generate exploratory policies in the simulator. This exploration process follows two approaches:

a) **Language-guided random exploration**: The foundation model generates high-level action suggestions based on the task description and current observation, which are then executed with random variations to encourage diverse behavior.

b) **Task-driven exploration**: For more complex tasks, we implement a simple planning algorithm where the foundation model breaks down the task into subtasks, and then explores to achieve each subtask.

Formally, at each time step $t$, given the current observation $o_t$ and task description $\tau$, the exploration policy generates a distribution over possible actions:

$$\pi_{\text{explore}}(a_t | o_t, \tau; F_{\text{base}}) = \text{softmax}(F_{\text{base}}(o_t, \tau, a_1, \ldots, a_K))$$

where $a_1, \ldots, a_K$ represent the set of possible actions in the current environment.

### 3. Data Collection and Filtering

As the agent interacts with the environment, we collect trajectories of the form:

$$\mathcal{D} = \{(o_1, \tau, a_1, r_1), (o_2, \tau, a_2, r_2), \ldots, (o_T, \tau, a_T, r_T)\}$$

where $o_t$ represents the observation at time $t$ (image, state, or text), $\tau$ is the task description, $a_t$ is the executed action, and $r_t$ is the reward or success signal provided by the environment.

To ensure the quality of the collected data, we implement the following filtering mechanisms:

a) **Success filtering**: Only trajectories that successfully complete the task (as determined by the environment's success criteria) are retained for training.

b) **Diversity filtering**: We maintain a diverse set of trajectories by using a similarity metric based on observation and action sequences, and prioritizing novel behaviors.

c) **Complexity sampling**: We sample trajectories with a bias toward those with higher complexity scores, measured by task length, number of subtasks, and environmental factors.

The filtered dataset $\mathcal{D}_{\text{filtered}}$ serves as the training data for our multi-modal foundation model with action prediction capabilities.

### 4. Multi-Modal Foundation Model with Action Prediction

We develop a foundation model that integrates vision, language, and action modalities. Starting from a pretrained vision-language model $F_{\text{VL}}$ (e.g., CLIP, ViLT), we augment it with an action prediction head $H_{\text{act}}$ that maps joint observation-language representations to action distributions.

The model architecture consists of:
- An image encoder $E_{\text{img}}(o) \rightarrow z_{\text{img}}$ that maps visual observations to a latent representation
- A text encoder $E_{\text{text}}(\tau) \rightarrow z_{\text{text}}$ that maps task descriptions to a latent representation
- A fusion module $F_{\text{fusion}}(z_{\text{img}}, z_{\text{text}}) \rightarrow z_{\text{joint}}$ that combines visual and linguistic representations
- An action prediction head $H_{\text{act}}(z_{\text{joint}}) \rightarrow p(a)$ that outputs a distribution over possible actions

The model is trained with the following objectives:

1. **Contrastive Learning Objective**: This aligns observations, language descriptions, and actions in a shared embedding space:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_{\text{joint}}, z_{\text{act}}) / \tau)}{\sum_{j} \exp(\text{sim}(z_{\text{joint}}, z_{\text{act}}^j) / \tau)}$$

where $\text{sim}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is a similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity), $\tau$ is a temperature parameter, and $z_{\text{act}}$ is an embedding of the action.

2. **Behavior Cloning Objective**: This directly predicts actions from observation-language pairs:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{BC}} = -\mathbb{E}_{(o,\tau,a) \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{filtered}}} [\log p(a | o, \tau)]$$

3. **Next Observation Prediction Objective**: This helps the model learn environment dynamics:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{dynamics}} = \mathbb{E}_{(o_t,a_t,o_{t+1}) \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{filtered}}} [||E_{\text{img}}(o_{t+1}) - G(E_{\text{img}}(o_t), a_t)||^2]$$

where $G$ is a dynamics prediction network.

The total loss function is a weighted combination of these objectives:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{BC}} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{dynamics}}$$

### 5. Iterative Bootstrapping

A key aspect of Sim2Act is the iterative bootstrapping process, where improved policies generate more complex interaction data:

1. Train an initial model $F_1$ on the filtered dataset $\mathcal{D}_{\text{filtered}}^1$
2. Deploy $F_1$ in the simulated environments to collect more complex trajectories, resulting in $\mathcal{D}_{\text{filtered}}^2$
3. Train an improved model $F_2$ on $\mathcal{D}_{\text{filtered}}^1 \cup \mathcal{D}_{\text{filtered}}^2$
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for $K$ iterations, gradually increasing task complexity

This process enables the model to bootstrap its way to handling increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks that would be difficult to learn directly.

### Experimental Design

We will evaluate Sim2Act through a comprehensive set of experiments designed to measure its effectiveness in bridging the actions gap for foundation models:

1. **Cross-Task Generalization**: We will measure the model's ability to generalize to novel tasks within the same environment:
   - Train on 80% of task types in each environment
   - Test on the remaining 20% of unseen task types
   - Metrics: Task success rate, completion time, action efficiency (measured by the ratio of optimal actions to total actions)

2. **Cross-Environment Generalization**: We will evaluate the model's ability to transfer knowledge across different environments:
   - Train on a subset of environments (e.g., AI2-THOR and MuJoCo)
   - Test on unseen environments (e.g., Habitat and PyBullet)
   - Metrics: Zero-shot and few-shot adaptation performance, measured by task success rates after 0 and 10 environment interactions

3. **Long-Horizon Planning and Reasoning**: We will assess the model's capacity for extended reasoning and planning:
   - Design composite tasks requiring 10+ steps to complete
   - Evaluate performance with and without explicit planning components
   - Metrics: Success rate on long-horizon tasks, plan optimality, error recovery rate

4. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: For a subset of robotic tasks, we will test the transfer of learned policies to real-world robots:
   - Train in simulation on manipulation tasks
   - Deploy on real robotic hardware (e.g., Franka Emika Panda arm)
   - Metrics: Real-world success rate, performance degradation compared to simulation

5. **Ablation Studies**: We will conduct ablation experiments to understand the contribution of each component:
   - Compare performance with and without contrastive learning
   - Evaluate the impact of curriculum learning and bootstrapping
   - Assess the effect of different filtering strategies
   - Analyze the importance of the dynamics prediction objective

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Task Success Rate**: Percentage of tasks successfully completed according to environment-defined criteria.
2. **Sample Efficiency**: Number of environment interactions required to achieve a target success rate.
3. **Generalization Gap**: Difference in performance between seen and unseen tasks/environments.
4. **Action Prediction Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly predicted actions given observation-task pairs.
5. **Plan Quality**: Measured by the ratio of steps taken to optimal steps for a given task.
6. **Robustness to Perturbations**: Success rate under environmental variations (lighting, object positions, etc.).

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

The Sim2Act framework is expected to yield several significant outcomes that advance the field of foundation models for decision making:

1. **A Novel Action-Aware Foundation Model**: We will develop a new class of foundation models that seamlessly integrate vision, language, and action understanding, bridging the perception-action gap that currently limits the application of foundation models in interactive settings.
