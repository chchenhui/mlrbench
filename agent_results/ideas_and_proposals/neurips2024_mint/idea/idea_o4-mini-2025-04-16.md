Title: Causal Circuit Editing: Low-Rank Activation Intervention for Bias Mitigation

Motivation:  
Foundation models often propagate unwanted biases and toxic content. Global fine-tuning can degrade general capabilities and is computationally expensive. A surgical, reversible mechanism that targets only the “bias circuits” within a model would allow fine-grained control, preserving overall performance while suppressing harmful behaviors.

Main Idea:  
1. Circuit Identification: Use causal mediation analysis to locate neurons, heads, or low-rank subspaces whose activation changes most strongly correlate with biased or toxic outputs (e.g., via intervention‐ablation studies on curated prompt sets).  
2. Intervention Module: Learn compact, low-rank weight or activation edits that selectively attenuate (or invert) signals along these bias directions during inference. Represent each edit as a small matrix \(U V^T\) inserted at targeted layers.  
3. Evaluation & Adaptivity: Measure bias reduction on benchmarks (StereoSet, HateCheck), track perplexity on downstream tasks, and dynamically adjust intervention strength based on context.  

Expected Outcomes & Impact:  
A plug-and-play intervention framework that surgically suppresses undesirable behaviors with minimal overhead, offering a path toward safer, more controllable foundation models.
