## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** Surgical Circuit Interventions: Targeted Harm Reduction in Foundation Models via Causal Pathway Neutralization

**2. Introduction:**

**Background:** Foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), represent a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks [4, 7]. However, their very power raises significant concerns. These models, trained on vast, unfiltered data, can inherit and amplify societal biases [2, 10], generate toxic or factually incorrect content [1, 9], and potentially be misused for malicious purposes. Addressing these risks is paramount for responsible AI development and deployment.

The MINT (Foundation Model Interventions) workshop at NeurIPS 2024 specifically calls for research into understanding the inner workings of these models and developing intervention techniques for enhanced controllability and safety [Workshop Call]. Current mitigation strategies often involve full model fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive, requires large curated datasets, and can lead to "catastrophic forgetting" or degradation of the model's general abilities [2, 4]. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA [4] and its variants [2, 3, 8] offer efficiency improvements but may still affect the model more broadly than necessary if not precisely targeted. Activation engineering or steering techniques [6, 1] provide alternative routes for influencing model behaviour during inference, but challenges remain in ensuring these interventions are specifically addressing the root cause of the undesirable behaviour without unintended side effects.

**Problem Statement:** There is a pressing need for harm mitigation techniques that are both effective and highly targeted, capable of neutralizing specific undesirable behaviours (e.g., generating biased statements, specific types of toxic language) without impairing the foundation model's overall fluency, knowledge, and utility across general tasks. Existing methods often lack the surgical precision required to isolate and disable only the problematic internal mechanisms, risking overly broad effects or requiring substantial computational resources.

**Research Idea & Objectives:** This research proposons a novel approach: **Surgical Circuit Interventions (SCI)**. The core idea is to first leverage mechanistic interpretability techniques, specifically causal tracing [5], to identify the minimal set of neural components (neurons, attention heads) forming the "circuits" causally responsible for generating specific, predefined harmful outputs. Second, we aim to develop and evaluate highly targeted, computationally efficient intervention methods applied *only* to these identified circuits during inference. These interventions, conceptualized as learned "circuit breakers" (via low-rank weight modifications) or precise "activation offsets", will be designed to disrupt the harmful computation within the identified pathway while leaving the rest of the model dynamics largely untouched.

The primary objectives of this research are:
1.  **Identify Causal Circuits for Harm:** Develop and refine methodologies based on causal tracing to reliably pinpoint the specific neural circuits within large foundation models that mediate the generation of targeted harmful content (e.g., specific gender biases, types of toxicity).
2.  **Develop Targeted Intervention Mechanisms:** Design and implement two distinct computationally efficient intervention strategies:
    *   **Low-Rank Circuit Breakers (LoRA-CB):** Learn targeted low-rank weight adaptations applied *only* to the parameters within the identified causal circuit to counteract its harmful contribution.
    *   **Activation Offsets (AO):** Learn precise, potentially context-dependent, activation offsets to be added to the activation values of components within the identified causal circuit during inference to neutralize its harmful effect.
3.  **Empirically Validate Effectiveness and Specificity:** Rigorously evaluate the proposed SCI methods on standard safety and NLP benchmarks. The evaluation will quantify:
    *   The reduction in targeted harmful outputs.
    *   The preservation of the model's general capabilities (fluency, knowledge, performance on unrelated tasks).
    *   The computational overhead (latency, memory) compared to baselines.

**Significance:** This research directly addresses the critical challenge of controlling foundation models highlighted by the MINT workshop [Workshop Call]. By focusing on *causally identified* minimal circuits, SCI promises a more principled and targeted approach to harm reduction than existing methods. Success would yield techniques enabling safer deployment of foundation models, offering fine-grained control over specific undesirable behaviours with potentially negligible impact on general performance and minimal computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, this work contributes to the fundamental understanding of how specific computations are implemented within these complex models [7], bridging the gap between interpretability and actionable intervention. It tackles key challenges outlined in the literature review, such as accurately identifying causal circuits [Challenge 1], developing targeted interventions [Challenge 2], and maintaining overall model capabilities [Challenge 3].

**3. Methodology:**

**Research Design:** This research will follow a structured, empirical approach involving model selection, data preparation, circuit identification, intervention development, and comprehensive evaluation.

**3.1 Foundational Models:**
We will primarily focus on widely used, powerful open-source autoregressive large language models, such as the Llama [Meta AI] or Mistral [Mistral AI] families. Using open models allows for full access to weights and activations, which is crucial for detailed mechanistic interpretability and intervention. We will select models of varying sizes (e.g., 7B, 13B parameters) to assess the scalability of our approach.

**3.2 Data Collection and Preparation:**
We require diverse datasets for different stages:
*   **Harm Identification & Intervention Training:**
    *   Datasets exhibiting specific, well-defined harmful behaviours. Examples include:
        *   **Bias:** Subsets of datasets like BOLD (Promoting Diverse and Bias-Free Responses from Large Language Models) or examining gender bias amplification using prompts designed based on prior work [5, 10]. We will focus on specific bias types (e.g., gender-occupation stereotypes).
        *   **Toxicity:** Datasets like ToxiGen or RealToxicityPrompts, potentially filtered for specific categories of toxicity (e.g., insults, identity attacks) to enable highly targeted interventions [9].
    *   For each harmful example/prompt, we ideally need a corresponding "clean" or desired counterpart (or a mechanism to define the desired behaviour, e.g., generating a neutral or counter-stereotypical response). This pairing is crucial for differential analysis during circuit identification and for defining the objective during intervention learning.
*   **General Capability Evaluation:**
    *   Standard language modeling benchmarks: e.g., Wikitext-103 for perplexity calculation.
    *   General NLP benchmarks: Subsets of GLUE and SuperGLUE (e.g., CoLA for fluency/grammar, SST-2 for sentiment, MNLI/RTE for NLI) to measure performance on diverse downstream tasks.
    *   Knowledge-based QA benchmarks: e.g., MMLU (subset) or TriviaQA to assess factual recall.
*   **Safety Evaluation:**
    *   Held-out test sets from the harm-specific datasets (ToxiGen, BOLD variants, etc.).
    *   Dedicated safety benchmarks like BBQ (Bias Benchmark for QA) or tools like the Perspective API to measure toxicity scores.

**3.3 Step 1: Causal Circuit Identification:**
We will adapt and refine causal tracing techniques [5, Meng et al., 2022] to identify the minimal circuits responsible for specific harmful outputs. The process involves:
1.  **Define Target Harm:** Select a specific, narrowly defined harmful behaviour (e.g., generating a stereotypical occupation for a given gender in a sentence completion task).
2.  **Collect Contrasting Inputs:** Gather pairs of inputs: one that reliably elicits the target harmful output ($x_{harm}$) and a closely related counterpart that elicits a neutral/desired output ($x_{clean}$).
3.  **Forward Pass Analysis:** Run the model on $x_{harm}$ and record all intermediate activations $A_{harm} = \{a_{l,i} | \forall \text{ layers } l, \text{ components } i\}$.
4.  **Corrupted Forward Pass:** Run the model on $x_{clean}$. During this forward pass, systematically intervene on activations at different layers and component positions (neurons in MLP layers, attention heads). For a given component $(l, i)$, replace its clean activation $a_{clean, l, i}$ with the corresponding activation from the harmful run $a_{harm, l, i}$.
5.  **Measure Effect:** Observe the impact of each single-component corruption on the final output probability distribution. Specifically, measure the increase in probability assigned to the harmful tokens $y_{harm}$ observed when running on $x_{harm}$.
6.  **Identify Causal Path:** Components $(l, i)$ whose corruption significantly increases the likelihood of $y_{harm}$ are considered part of the causal circuit $C$ for that specific behaviour. We may need heuristics or thresholds to define "significant" and aggregate results across multiple input pairs to identify robust circuits.
Mathematically, we seek the set $C = \{(l, i)\}$ such that intervening on $a_{clean, l, i} \leftarrow a_{harm, l, i}$ maximizes $P(y_{harm} | x_{clean}, \text{intervention})$. We aim for the *minimal* such set that achieves a desired level of causal influence.

**3.4 Step 2: Intervention Mechanism Development:**
Based on the identified circuit $C$, we will develop two intervention methods applied during inference:

*   **Method 1: Low-Rank Circuit Breakers (LoRA-CB):**
    *   Inspired by LoRA [4], we propose learning low-rank updates $\Delta W = BA$ (where $B$ is a low-rank matrix and $A$ is another low-rank matrix) specifically for the weight matrices $W$ associated with the components (MLP layers, attention projection matrices) within the identified circuit $C$.
    *   The key difference from standard LoRA is **specificity**: the update $\Delta W$ is *only* applied to parameters involved in the computation of components $(l, i) \in C$.
    *   Learning Objective: The matrices $B$ and $A$ (with ranks $r \ll \text{dim}(W)$) will be trained to minimize a composite loss function over a training set of harmful/clean prompt pairs:
        $$ \mathcal{L}_{LoRA-CB} = \mathbb{E}_{(x_{harm}, x_{clean})} [ \mathcal{L}_{harm}(F(x_{harm}; \theta + \Delta W_C), y_{desired}) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{preserve}(F(x_{clean}; \theta + \Delta W_C), y_{clean}) ] $$
        where $F$ is the model, $\theta$ are original weights, $\Delta W_C$ denotes the low-rank updates applied only to circuit $C$, $y_{desired}$ is the target output for $x_{harm}$ (e.g., refusal, neutral response), $y_{clean}$ is the expected output for $x_{clean}$, $\mathcal{L}_{harm}$ penalizes generating the harmful content, $\mathcal{L}_{preserve}$ (e.g., KL divergence between original and intervened output distributions) penalizes deviation on clean inputs, and $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter balancing harm reduction and preservation.

*   **Method 2: Activation Offsets (AO):**
    *   Inspired by activation steering [1, 6], We propose learning a specific offset vector $\delta_{l,i}$ for each component $(l, i) \in C$.
    *   During inference, the activation $a_{l,i}$ of a component in the circuit is modified: $a'_{l,i} = a_{l,i} + \delta_{l,i}$.
    *   The offset $\delta_{l,i}$ could be:
        *   **Fixed:** A single learned vector per component $(l, i) \in C$.
        *   **Context-Dependent:** Learned as a function of earlier activations or the input, potentially via a small neural network.
    *   Learning Objective: The offsets $\{\delta_{l,i} | (l,i) \in C\}$ will be optimized similarly to LoRA-CB, minimizing a loss function:
        $$ \mathcal{L}_{AO} = \mathbb{E}_{(x_{harm}, x_{clean})} [ \mathcal{L}_{harm}(F(x_{harm}; \theta, \delta_C), y_{desired}) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{preserve}(F(x_{clean}; \theta, \delta_C), y_{clean}) ] $$
        where $F(x; \theta, \delta_C)$ denotes inference with activation offsets applied to circuit $C$. Gradients can be computed with respect to the offsets $\delta_{l,i}$.

**Computational Efficiency:** Both methods are designed for low inference overhead. LoRA-CB adds minimal parameters (rank $r$ is small). AO involves simple vector additions at specific activation points.

**3.5 Step 3: Experimental Design and Validation:**
*   **Baselines:** We will compare our SCI methods (LoRA-CB and AO) against:
    1.  The original, unmodified foundation model.
    2.  Full fine-tuning on a safety dataset covering the targeted harm.
    3.  Standard LoRA fine-tuning [4] on the same safety dataset.
    4.  A non-causal activation steering method [6] (if applicable for the harm type, potentially steering towards "safe" concepts).
    5.  Possibly FLORAIN [1] as a state-of-the-art activation intervention baseline, though its probe-free nature differs from our targeted circuit approach.
*   **Experimental Procedure:**
    1.  Select target harm(s) and prepare datasets.
    2.  Apply causal tracing (Section 3.3) to identify circuits $C$ for each harm in the chosen model(s).
    3.  Train LoRA-CB ($\Delta W_C$) and AO ($\delta_C$) interventions using the defined loss functions (Section 3.4).
    4.  Train/prepare baseline intervention methods on the same data.
    5.  Evaluate all models (original, baselines, SCI methods) across the following dimensions:
        *   **Harm Reduction:** Measure the frequency/severity of the targeted harmful output on held-out test prompts using specific metrics (e.g., % reduction in toxic generations, decrease in stereotype association scores on BBQ).
        *   **General Capability Preservation:** Measure perplexity on Wikitext-103, accuracy on selected GLUE/SuperGLUE tasks, and accuracy on knowledge probes (MMLU/TriviaQA). Compare scores against the original model.
        *   **Specificity:** Test whether intervening on a circuit for harm type A affects unrelated harm type B or performance on unrelated tasks significantly more than expected baseline degradation.
        *   **Computational Cost:** Measure increase in inference latency and memory footprint (parameter count for LoRA-CB).
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    *   Vary the size/scope of the identified circuit $C$ (e.g., include more/fewer components based on causal tracing thresholds) and assess the impact on effectiveness and specificity.
    *   Compare fixed vs. context-dependent activation offsets (AO).
    *   Vary the rank $r$ for LoRA-CB.

**3.6 Evaluation Metrics:**
*   **Safety/Harm:** Toxicity score (e.g., Perspective API), Bias scores (e.g., Stereotype Score, Association metrics from WEAT/SEAT applied to embeddings, BBQ accuracy difference between biased/unbiased contexts), Frequency of specific harmful completions (%).
*   **General Performance:** Perplexity (PPL), Accuracy (Acc) on downstream tasks (GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU), BLEU/ROUGE scores for generative tasks if applicable (though primary focus is on classification/knowledge/perplexity).
*   **Efficiency:** Inference time per token (ms), Added parameters (for LoRA-CB), Memory usage increase (MB).

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact:**

**Expected Outcomes:**
1.  **Identified Causal Circuits:** We expect to successfully identify compact sets of neurons and attention heads that are demonstrably causal for specific, predefined harmful behaviours (e.g., gender bias in occupation prediction, generation of specific toxic phrases) in models like Llama/Mistral.
2.  **Functional Intervention Methods:** We anticipate developing functional implementations of both LoRA-CB and AO intervention methods capable of significantly reducing the targeted harmful outputs.
3.  **Empirical Validation of High Specificity:** We expect experimental results to demonstrate that both SCI methods achieve substantial reduction in the targeted harm (comparable to or exceeding baseline PEFT methods) while incurring significantly less degradation in general capabilities (perplexity, downstream task performance) compared to full fine-tuning and potentially standard LoRA/other PEFT methods. We hypothesize that AO might offer lower computational overhead while LoRA-CB might provide more stable control.
4.  **Comparative Analysis:** A clear comparison of the effectiveness, specificity, and efficiency trade-offs between LoRA-CB, AO, and relevant baselines.
5.  **Methodological Refinements:** Contributions to refining causal tracing techniques for robustness and scalability in large models.

**Potential Impact:**
*   **Safer AI Deployment:** This research offers a pathway to more trustworthy foundation models by providing tools to surgically remove specific undesirable capabilities without neutering the model's overall utility. This aligns directly with the goals of the MINT workshop.
*   **Efficient Harm Mitigation:** The proposed methods promise computationally cheap interventions (minimal inference overhead), making them practical for real-world deployment compared to costly full fine-tuning.
*   **Advancing Mechanistic Interpretability:** By linking causally identified circuits to targeted interventions, this work strengthens the practical value of mechanistic interpretability, moving beyond pure understanding towards precise control [7, Workshop Call].
*   **New Intervention Paradigms:** SCI represents a new class of intervention that leverages causal knowledge for precision, potentially inspiring further research into highly targeted model editing and control.
*   **Addressing Key Challenges:** This work directly tackles the critical challenges of targeted intervention, minimal impact on desired capabilities, and efficiency in the context of foundation model safety [Lit Review Challenges 1-4]. Demonstrating generalization across different harms and model sizes would address [Challenge 5].

**Dissemination:** Findings will be written up for submission to the NeurIPS 2024 MINT Workshop and potentially a relevant follow-up conference (e.g., NeurIPS main track, ICML, ICLR) or journal. Code implementing the methods and experimental setup will be released open-source to facilitate reproducibility and further research.
