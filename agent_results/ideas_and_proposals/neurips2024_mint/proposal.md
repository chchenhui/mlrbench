# SCALPEL: Surgical Circuit Interventions for Precision Harm Mitigation in Foundation Models

## 1. Introduction

Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence with their remarkable generative capabilities, but these advances have been accompanied by growing concerns about potential harms. These models can inadvertently perpetuate biases, generate toxic content, or produce misleading information that may cause societal harm. While these undesirable behaviors are often the target of mitigation efforts, current approaches like full model fine-tuning present significant drawbacks: they require substantial computational resources, risk compromising the model's general capabilities, and often implement broad, heavy-handed solutions to nuanced problems.

Recent research has begun exploring more targeted approaches to modify model behavior. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) have shown promise in reducing computational costs, while causal tracing studies have advanced our understanding of how specific neural circuits contribute to particular outputs (Doe & Smith, 2023). Similarly, activation steering techniques (Johnson & Lee, 2023) and probe-free interventions like FLORAIN (Jiang et al., 2025) demonstrate the potential for targeted modifications during inference.

Despite these advances, a critical research gap remains: we lack systematic methods to precisely identify and surgically intervene in the minimal neural circuits responsible for specific harmful behaviors without compromising the model's broader capabilities. This precision is crucial, as overly broad interventions risk degrading model performance on unrelated tasks, while insufficient interventions may fail to effectively mitigate the targeted harm.

This research proposal, SCALPEL (Surgical Circuit Interventions for Precision Harm Mitigation in Foundation Models), aims to address this gap by developing a comprehensive framework for identifying causal neural circuits responsible for specific undesirable behaviors in foundation models and creating precise, computationally efficient interventions to neutralize these circuits during inference. Our approach combines causal tracing with targeted low-rank interventions, effectively creating "circuit breakers" that can be selectively activated to prevent harmful outputs while preserving general model capabilities.

The proposed research has three primary objectives:
1. Develop robust methods to identify and isolate minimal neural circuits causally responsible for specific harmful behaviors in foundation models
2. Design and implement targeted, computationally efficient intervention techniques that precisely neutralize identified harmful circuits
3. Validate the effectiveness of these surgical interventions through comprehensive evaluation on both safety benchmarks and general performance metrics

By achieving these objectives, our research will contribute significantly to the field of foundation model safety, providing practical methods for precision harm mitigation without compromising model utility. The proposed techniques will enable more controlled deployment of foundation models, reducing potential harms while preserving the benefits these powerful systems offer to society.

## 2. Methodology

Our methodology comprises three interconnected phases: circuit identification, intervention design, and comprehensive evaluation. Each phase builds on the previous one to create a holistic approach to precision harm mitigation in foundation models.

### 2.1 Circuit Identification

The first phase focuses on identifying and isolating the minimal neural circuits causally responsible for specific harmful behaviors. We will employ a systematic, data-driven approach using controlled generative examples.

#### 2.1.1 Dataset Creation

We will construct specialized datasets for each targeted harmful behavior (e.g., gender bias, toxicity, misinformation) containing pairs of:
- Harmful completions: Model outputs exhibiting the targeted undesirable behavior
- Neutral completions: Alternative completions for the same prompts that do not exhibit the harmful behavior

Each dataset will contain 500-1000 carefully curated example pairs, developed through a combination of existing benchmark examples and new examples designed to isolate specific harmful patterns.

#### 2.1.2 Causal Tracing

Building on the methodology from Doe and Smith (2023), we will implement causal tracing to identify the neural paths responsible for the difference between harmful and neutral outputs:

1. For each example pair, we will run the model to generate both the harmful and neutral completions, storing the intermediate activations at each layer.

2. We will quantify the "harmfulness score" $H(y)$ of each output $y$ using appropriate metrics for the targeted harm (e.g., toxicity scores for toxic content, bias metrics for biased content).

3. For each layer $l$ and attention head $h$, we will perform counterfactual interventions by patching the activations from the neutral completion into the harmful completion generation process:

$$A_{l,h}^{patched} = A_{l,h}^{neutral}$$

where $A_{l,h}$ represents the activation values of attention head $h$ at layer $l$.

4. We will measure the causal effect of each patch on reducing the harmfulness score:

$$\text{CausalEffect}(l,h) = H(y_{harmful}) - H(y_{patched})$$

5. Components with the highest causal effect scores will be candidates for our minimal circuit.

#### 2.1.3 Circuit Refinement

To identify the minimal set of components necessary for the harmful behavior, we will:

1. Rank components (attention heads, MLP neurons) by their causal effect scores
2. Implement an iterative pruning approach to identify the minimal subset of components that, when patched simultaneously, substantially reduce the harmful behavior:

$$\text{MinimalCircuit} = \arg\min_{S \subseteq \text{Components}} |S| \text{ subject to } \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} H(y_i^{S-patched}) < \tau$$

where $\tau$ is a threshold for acceptable harm, $N$ is the number of examples, and $y_i^{S-patched}$ is the model output when components in set $S$ are patched.

3. Validate the identified circuits through ablation studies, ensuring that intervening in these circuits significantly reduces the targeted harmful behavior while minimal impact on unrelated tasks.

### 2.2 Intervention Design

Once we have identified the minimal circuits responsible for specific harmful behaviors, we will design targeted interventions to neutralize these circuits during inference without compromising overall model performance.

#### 2.2.1 Circuit Breaker Development

We will develop "circuit breakers" - specialized low-rank adaptations specifically designed to neutralize the identified harmful circuits:

1. For each identified harmful circuit, we will initialize a low-rank adaptation matrix pair $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ where $r \ll d$ is the rank of the adaptation and $d$ is the dimension of the affected component.

2. The circuit breaker applies a transformation to the activations of the identified component:

$$A_{l,h}^{modified} = A_{l,h} + \delta \cdot (BA_{l,h})$$

where $\delta$ is a scaling factor that can be adjusted during inference.

3. We will train these circuit breakers to minimize:

$$\mathcal{L}_{breaker} = \lambda_1 \cdot \mathcal{L}_{harm} + \lambda_2 \cdot \mathcal{L}_{preserve}$$

where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{harm}$ is a loss function measuring the harmful behavior in the model outputs
- $\mathcal{L}_{preserve}$ is a loss function measuring deviation from expected outputs on unrelated tasks
- $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are hyperparameters controlling the trade-off between harm reduction and performance preservation

#### 2.2.2 Activation Steering Vectors

As an alternative intervention approach, we will develop specialized activation steering vectors for the identified harmful circuits:

1. For each identified circuit, we will compute the average activation difference between harmful and neutral completions:

$$\Delta A_{l,h} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (A_{l,h,i}^{neutral} - A_{l,h,i}^{harmful})$$

2. We will refine these steering vectors through an optimization process:

$$v_{l,h}^* = \arg\min_{v} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} H(f(x_i, A_{l,h} + \alpha \cdot v))$$

where $f(x_i, A_{l,h} + \alpha \cdot v)$ is the model output when applying steering vector $v$ with strength $\alpha$ to activations $A_{l,h}$ for input $x_i$.

3. These steering vectors can be applied during inference with adjustable strength to control the trade-off between harm reduction and performance preservation.

#### 2.2.3 Intervention Selection Framework

We will develop a framework to automatically select the most appropriate intervention for a given input:

1. For each input, we will compute a harm potential score $P_{harm}(x)$ using a classifier trained to identify potentially harmful inputs.

2. Based on this score, we will dynamically adjust the intervention strength:

$$\alpha(x) = \alpha_{base} \cdot \sigma(w \cdot P_{harm}(x) + b)$$

where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, and $w$, $b$ are learnable parameters.

3. This allows for more aggressive interventions on inputs with high harm potential while applying minimal or no intervention to safe inputs.

### 2.3 Comprehensive Evaluation

We will conduct rigorous evaluations to assess both the effectiveness of our interventions in mitigating targeted harms and their impact on the model's general capabilities.

#### 2.3.1 Harm Mitigation Evaluation

We will evaluate our interventions on specialized harm benchmarks:
- ToxiGen for toxicity
- BOLD and WinoBias for bias
- TruthfulQA for misinformation
- Custom test sets for other targeted harms

Metrics:
- Reduction in harmful outputs (measured by appropriate harm metrics)
- Precision and recall in harm mitigation
- False positive rates (benign outputs incorrectly modified)

#### 2.3.2 General Capability Preservation

To ensure our interventions do not degrade the model's general capabilities, we will evaluate on:
- MMLU for knowledge and reasoning
- BBH for instruction following
- GSM8K for mathematical reasoning
- HellaSwag for commonsense reasoning
- Diverse creative writing tasks

Metrics:
- Performance differential between original model and model with interventions
- Statistical significance testing to verify minimal impact

#### 2.3.3 Robustness Analysis

We will assess the robustness of our interventions through:
- Red-teaming exercises to identify potential evasion techniques
- Sensitivity analysis to input variations
- Ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component
- Cross-domain generalization tests to ensure interventions work across diverse contexts
