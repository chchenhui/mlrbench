Lyapunov-Constrained Reinforcement Learning: Joint Policy-Lyapunov Neural Networks for Provably Stable Control  

2. Introduction  
Background. Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in high-dimensional sequential decision-making tasks but typically lacks formal stability guarantees. In contrast, control theory has long leveraged Lyapunov stability to certify closed-loop performance in safety-critical systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, adaptive transportation). The gap between RL’s adaptability and control theory’s rigorous stability framework limits the deployment of learned controllers in domains where safety and robustness are paramount.  

Research Objectives. This project aims to develop a model-free RL algorithm that jointly learns a control policy and a Lyapunov function, both parameterized by neural networks, under a unified constrained optimization framework. Specifically, we will:  
  • Design a Lyapunov-constrained policy optimization (LCPO) algorithm that enforces a learned Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) to decrease along trajectories.  
  • Provide theoretical guarantees on closed-loop stability (in the sense of Lyapunov) and near-optimality (bounded performance loss compared to unconstrained RL).  
  • Validate scalability and robustness through extensive simulations on standard continuous-control benchmarks and a high-dimensional robotic manipulator.  

Significance. By endowing RL with formal stability certificates, this research will bridge a critical gap between machine learning and control theory, enabling the deployment of adaptive, high-performance controllers in safety-critical environments. Proposed methods will foster trust in learned policies and open new avenues for industrial automation, robotics, and transportation systems.  

3. Related Work  
A host of recent works integrate Lyapunov functions into RL. McCutcheon et al. (2025) propose sample-efficient neural Lyapunov approximation with self-supervised data generation. Chen et al. (2025) integrate Soft-Actor-Critic with task-specific CLFs for improved stability (SAC-CLF). Zhang (2024) introduces a model-based RL framework with neural Lyapunov certificates. Yao et al. (2024) extend Lyapunov RL to distributed control. Earlier efforts (Sun et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Han et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) incorporate Lyapunov-based constraints into policy optimization or safe exploration. Despite progress, key challenges remain: designing expressive CLFs for complex nonlinear dynamics, balancing safety and exploration, minimizing computational overhead, and providing end-to-end theoretical guarantees in a model-free setting. Our approach addresses these gaps by jointly learning policy and Lyapunov function via a Lagrangian-based constrained RL algorithm, alongside sample-complexity and stability analyses.  

4. Methodology  
4.1 Overview  
We consider an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) $\{ \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, f, r, \gamma \}$ with unknown dynamics $s_{t+1}=f(s_t,a_t)$ and reward $r(s,a)$. We introduce two neural networks: a stochastic policy $\pi_\theta(a\mid s)$ and a Lyapunov network $V_\phi(s):\mathcal{S}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$. Our goal is to maximize cumulative reward while enforcing the Lyapunov decrease condition: for some margin $\alpha>0$,  
$$
V_\phi(s_{t+1}) - V_\phi(s_t)\,\le\,-\alpha\,\|s_t\|^2,\quad\forall(s_t,a_t)\!,
$$  
which guarantees asymptotic stability around $s=0$.  

4.2 Constrained Objective and Lagrangian  
Define the expected return  
$$
J(\theta)=\E_{\tau\sim\pi_\theta}\Bigl[\sum_{t=0}^\infty\gamma^t\,r(s_t,a_t)\Bigr]\!,
$$  
and the expected constraint violation  
$$
C(\theta,\phi)=\E_{s\sim d^{\pi_\theta},\,a\sim\pi_\theta(\cdot\mid s)}\bigl[\max\bigl(0,\,\Delta V_\phi(s,a)+\alpha\|s\|^2\bigr)\bigr],
$$  
where $\Delta V_\phi(s,a)=V_\phi(f(s,a))-V_\phi(s)$ and $d^{\pi_\theta}$ is the discounted state-occupancy measure. We solve  
$$
\max_{\theta,\phi}\;J(\theta)
\quad\text{subject to}\quad
C(\theta,\phi)=0.
$$  
Introducing a Lagrange multiplier $\lambda\ge0$ yields the unconstrained saddle-point problem  
$$
\min_{\lambda\ge0}\;\max_{\theta,\phi}\;\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi,\lambda)
\quad\text{with}\quad
\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi,\lambda)=J(\theta)\;-\;\lambda\,C(\theta,\phi).
$$  
In practice we solve this via block-coordinate updates:  

 1. Policy and critic update ($\theta$, $\psi$): using a clipped surrogate (PPO-style) or entropy-regularized actor-critic (SAC) objective augmented by $-\lambda\,C(\theta,\phi)$.  
 2. Lyapunov network update ($\phi$): minimize $C(\theta,\phi)$ plus a regularization term to enforce positiveness and radial unboundedness:  
    $$
    L_V(\phi)=C(\theta,\phi)\;+\;\beta\,\E_{s\sim\mathcal{D}}\bigl[\max(0,\,-V_\phi(s)+\epsilon)\bigr],
    $$
    where $\beta,\epsilon>0$.  
 3. Dual ascent ($\lambda$):  
    $$
    \lambda\leftarrow\bigl[\lambda+\rho\,C(\theta,\phi)\bigr]_+,
    $$
    with step size $\rho>0$.  

4.3 Theoretical Analysis  
Under assumptions that: (i) $f$ is Lipschitz continuous, (ii) $\pi_\theta$ and $V_\phi$ are universal function approximators, and (iii) samples are i.i.d. from a behavior policy covering a compact set $\mathcal{S}_0$, we will prove:  
  • (Feasibility) $\limsup_{k\to\infty}C(\theta_k,\phi_k)\le O(1/K)$ as the number of updates $K\to\infty$.  
  • (Near-Optimality) $J^*-J(\theta_K)\le O(1/\sqrt{K})$, where $J^*$ is the unconstrained optimum.  

Proof techniques combine variational analysis for constrained policy optimization (Achiam et al., 2017) with neural network generalization bounds (Barron-type) to derive sample-complexity $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ for an $\epsilon$-approximate saddle point. Detailed proofs will be included in the appendix of subsequent technical papers.  

4.4 Safe Exploration and Initialization  
To avoid catastrophic instability during early training, we will:  
  • Pre-train $V_\phi$ on expert or safe demonstrations (offline trajectories) to approximate a rough CLF.  
  • Restrict policy exploration to a safe set $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{safe}}=\{s:V_\phi(s)\le c\}$ for an initial threshold $c>0$.  
  • Gradually loosen constraints as $\phi$ improves, enabling exploration of a larger region while preserving safety.  

4.5 Experimental Design  
Benchmarks. We will evaluate on classic continuous-control tasks (OpenAI Gym, MuJoCo): Inverted Pendulum, Cart-Pole Swing-Up, Acrobot, and Half-Cheetah, plus a 7-DoF simulated manipulator (PyBullet).  

Baselines. Compare against:  
  • Unconstrained RL: PPO, SAC.  
  • Lyapunov RL methods: SAC-CLF (Chen et al., 2025), Neural CLF-RL (McCutcheon et al., 2025), Safe MB-RL (Zhang, 2024).  

Metrics.  
  • Cumulative reward $J(\theta)$ (mean ± std over 20 seeds).  
  • Constraint violation rate: fraction of transitions with $\Delta V_\phi(s,a)+\alpha\|s\|^2>0$.  
  • Stability margin: smallest $\epsilon$ such that $V_\phi(s_{t+1})-V_\phi(s_t)\le -\alpha\|s\|^2+\epsilon$.  
  • Robustness: performance drop under unmodeled disturbances and parameter noise.  
  • Computational overhead: wall-clock time per training epoch.  

Statistical Analysis. Results will report mean ± SEM, with significance tested via paired t-tests ($p<0.05$). Ablation studies will quantify impact of Lagrangian penalty, pre-training, and safe-set scheduling.  

Implementation Details.  
  • Networks: 3-layer MLPs with 256 units, ReLU activations.  
  • Optimizer: Adam ($\alpha=3\!\times\!10^{-4}$).  
  • Constraint coefficients: $\alpha=0.1$, $\beta=1.0$, dual step $\rho=0.01$.  
  • Batch size: 1024 transitions, rollout length 2048 steps.  
  • Training horizon: up to 1e6 environment steps per task.  

5. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
5.1 Expected Outcomes  
  • Provably Stable Policies. Our LCPO algorithm will produce control policies satisfying the learned Lyapunov decrease condition with high probability, yielding asymptotic stability in simulation.  
  • Competitive Performance. We anticipate RL performance within 5–10% of unconstrained baselines, while eliminating catastrophic failures.  
  • Robustness Gains. Stability certificates will confer robustness to perturbations (e.g., up to 20% unmodeled dynamics).  
  • Theoretical Guarantees. Rigorous proofs of feasibility and near-optimality, together with sample-complexity bounds, will set new standards for model-free stable RL.  

5.2 Broader Impact  
This research will pave the way for deploying RL in safety-critical domains previously off-limits due to instability concerns. By combining adaptability and formal safety guarantees, our framework empowers autonomous vehicles, robotic systems, and industrial processes to learn online without sacrificing reliability. The project will foster cross-disciplinary collaboration between machine learning and control theory, and release a modular open-source implementation to accelerate further research. We anticipate that Lyapunov-constrained RL will become a foundational building block for the next generation of trustworthy autonomous systems.
