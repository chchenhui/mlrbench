**Title**: Hybrid Control-Theoretic Neural Dynamical Models for Robust Reinforcement Learning in Partially Observed Environments  

**Motivation**:  
Despite advancements in reinforcement learning (RL), its application to high-stakes systems (e.g., robotics, automated control) is hindered by the lack of stability and robustness guarantees. Conversely, control theory excels in providing formal guarantees for deterministic/linear systems but struggles with scalability and adaptability in complex, partially observed environments. Bridging these fields can address critical challenges in deploying RL where safety and reliability are paramount.  

**Main Idea**:  
We propose integrating control-theoretic principles into deep neural network-based RL to enforce stability and robustness while maintaining adaptability in partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Key elements include:  
1. **Structured Hyrbid Architecture**: Use a physics-informed neural model to decompose system dynamics into known physical constraints (derived from control theory) and unknown residuals modeled by a deep network.  
2. **Lyapunov-Guided Policy Optimization**: Introduce Lyapunov-function-based regularizers into RL loss functions to ensure system stability during training, overcoming the sample inefficiency of purely data-driven approaches.  
3. **Memory-Augmented Exploration**: Combine control-based controllers (e.g., Kalman filters) with neural memory modules to handle partial observability, balancing exploration-exploitation while respecting safety bounds.  
Expected outcomes include sample-efficient RL algorithms with formal guarantees of robustness and performance bounds in high-dimensional, uncertain environments, validated on industrial control tasks (e.g., autonomous drones). The impact is dual: advancing theoretical RL with control-theoretic structure and enabling trustworthy deployment in safety-critical systems.
