# Bridging Control Theory and Reinforcement Learning through Robust Policy Gradient Methods

## Motivation
Despite sharing similar goals, reinforcement learning (RL) and control theory approaches have developed largely in parallel, with limited cross-fertilization. While RL offers data-driven solutions to complex problems, it often lacks the theoretical guarantees that make control theory suitable for high-stakes applications. This research addresses the critical need for RL algorithms that incorporate the stability and robustness guarantees from control theory while maintaining the flexibility and scalability of modern RL approaches.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel framework called "Robust Policy Gradient Methods" that integrates Lyapunov stability analysis with policy gradient algorithms. The key innovation is a constrained optimization formulation where traditional policy gradient objectives are augmented with Lyapunov-based stability constraints. By incorporating control-theoretic principles directly into the policy update mechanism, we can provide formal guarantees on the closed-loop stability of the learned policies while preserving the flexibility of deep RL approaches. This framework will be implemented through a two-step process: first, learning approximate Lyapunov functions from data; second, incorporating these functions as safety constraints during policy optimization. The approach can be applied to continuous control problems where safety and stability are critical, such as industrial automation and autonomous vehicles, bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical performance in complex environments.
