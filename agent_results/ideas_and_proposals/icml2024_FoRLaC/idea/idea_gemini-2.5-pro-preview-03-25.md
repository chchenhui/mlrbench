**Title:** Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning via Control-Theoretic Uncertainty Sets

**Motivation:** Standard offline RL algorithms often fail when deployed due to distribution shift between the training data and the real environment. This lack of robustness hinders their use in safety-critical applications where control theory traditionally provides guarantees against uncertainty.

**Main Idea:** We propose integrating robust control principles into offline RL policy optimization. First, learn a nominal dynamics model or Q-function from the offline dataset. Crucially, concurrently estimate an uncertainty set around this nominal model using techniques inspired by system identification and robust control (e.g., bounding model errors based on data coverage or using scenario optimization). The policy learning objective is then reformulated as a robust optimization problem: find a policy maximizing the worst-case performance over all plausible models within the derived uncertainty set. This minimax approach, potentially solved via robust dynamic programming or specialized policy gradient methods, aims to yield policies with quantifiable robustness margins against model mismatch inherent in offline data, enhancing reliability for deployment in high-stake systems.
