**Title:** Interpretable Language Models for Low-Resource Languages: Enhancing Transparency and Equity  

**Motivation:** Language models (LMs) for low-resource languages face dual challenges: limited training data, which exacerbates performance inconsistencies, and a lack of transparency, which hinders trust and equitable deployment. Without explainability, marginalized linguistic communities may face unchecked biases or unreliable outputs, perpetuating exclusion. This research addresses critical gaps in socially responsible AI by making LMs both accessible and accountable for underrepresented languages.  

**Main Idea:** Develop an interpretability framework tailored to low-resource LMs, combining adapted technical methods with community-driven validation. First, extend local explanation techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to accommodate linguistic features unique to these languages, such as morphology or code-switching patterns. Second, collaborate with native speakers to co-design intuitive explanation interfaces that align with cultural communication norms. Finally, establish evaluation metrics assessing both technical robustness (via perturbed input tests) and user-perceived trust (through surveys and task-based trials). Expected outcomes include open-source tools for model introspection and guidelines for culturally grounded explainability. This work aims to reduce bias risks, foster equitable LM adoption, and empower communities to audit and refine models, advancing the dual goals of transparency and inclusivity in global NLP applications.
