**Title:** Interpretability-Driven Red-Teaming for Targeted Harm Mitigation in LMs

**Motivation:** Standard red-teaming for identifying LM harms can be inefficient, relying on broad exploration. Understanding *why* LMs produce harmful outputs (bias, toxicity, unsafe content) is crucial for effective mitigation. This research aims to enhance red-teaming by using interpretability to pinpoint specific internal mechanisms driving harmful behavior, enabling more focused and effective safety interventions.

**Main Idea:** We propose integrating interpretability techniques (e.g., feature attribution, mechanistic interpretability) into the red-teaming process. Instead of solely focusing on generating harmful outputs, this approach first uses interpretability tools to analyze model activations and reasoning paths during potentially harmful interactions. This identifies specific model components or learned features associated with undesirable behaviors. These insights then guide red-teamers to craft targeted prompts designed to stress-test these identified vulnerabilities systematically. This interpretability-driven approach promises more efficient discovery of failure modes and facilitates developing targeted mitigation strategies, leading to safer and more robust LMs.
