# Bridging the Transparency Gap: Community-Driven Interpretability Frameworks for Low-Resource Language Models  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
The rapid advancement of language models (LMs) has disproportionately benefited high-resource languages like English, leaving low-resource languages—often spoken by marginalized communities—at risk of technological exclusion. While recent efforts (e.g., InkubaLM, Glot500) demonstrate that performant LMs can be built with limited data, transparency remains a critical barrier. Opaque models risk perpetuating biases, undermining user trust, and amplifying social inequities. Existing explainability tools (SHAP, LIME) are designed for resource-rich languages and struggle with linguistic phenomena common in low-resource contexts, such as morphological complexity, code-switching, and dialectal variation. Moreover, cultural misalignment in explanation interfaces further limits their utility.  

### Research Objectives  
This work aims to:  
1. Develop **morphologically and sociolinguistically adaptive explanation methods** for low-resource LMs.  
2. **Co-design culturally grounded explanation interfaces** with native speaker communities.  
3. Establish **dual-focus evaluation metrics** measuring both algorithmic robustness and user-perceived trust.  

### Significance  
By addressing the interplay between technical interpretability and community needs, this research advances the socially responsible deployment of LMs. It empowers marginalized communities to audit models, reduces unchecked biases, and fosters equitable adoption of NLP technologies.  

## 2. Methodology  

### Research Design  
#### Phase 1: Adaptive Explanation Techniques  
**Data Collection:**  
- Leverage **Glot500** (511 languages) and **InkubaLM** (African languages) datasets.  
- Collaborate with linguists to annotate morphological boundaries and code-switching patterns in 10 target languages (e.g., isiZulu, Quechua).  

**Algorithmic Adaptations:**  
- **Morphology-Aware SHAP:** Modify SHAP’s feature perturbation to respect morpheme boundaries. Let $x = \\{m_1, ..., m_n\\}$ represent a tokenized input segmented into morphemes. For a model $f$, the explanation $\phi_i$ for morpheme $m_i$ is:  
  $$  
  \phi_i = \sum_{S \subseteq M \setminus \\{m_i\\}} \frac{|S|! (|M| - |S| - 1)!}{|M|!} \left[ f(S \cup \\{m_i\\}) - f(S) \right]  
  $$  
  where $M$ is the set of all morphemes.  

- **Code-Switching LIME:** Adjust LIME’s sampling kernel to preserve code-switch points. For a sentence with $k$ code-switched spans, sample perturbations by swapping spans of the same language using aligned corpora.  

#### Phase 2: Community-Driven Interface Design  
- Conduct **participatory workshops** with native speakers in three regions (Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Indigenous South America).  
- Iteratively prototype explanation interfaces using visual metaphors aligned with local communication norms (e.g., proverbs for uncertainty, color hierarchies for saliency).  
- Validate designs via **think-aloud sessions** and adapt based on feedback.  

#### Phase 3: Evaluation Framework  
**Technical Robustness:**  
- **Perturbation Tests:** Measure explanation fidelity under morpheme deletion, code-switch insertion, and dialectal variation. Compute consistency score:  
  $$  
  \text{Consistency} = 1 - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \text{KL}\left(\phi(x_i) \parallel \phi(\tilde{x}_i)\right)  
  $$  
  where $\tilde{x}_i$ is a perturbed version of input $x_i$.  

- **Bias Detection:** Use GlotLID-M to identify misclassifications and correlate with explanation saliency maps.  

**User-Centric Trust:**  
- Deploy **task-based trials** where users correct model outputs using explanations. Track success rate and time-to-correction.  
- Administer surveys measuring pre/post-trial trust on a 7-point Likert scale across dimensions like *understandability* and *fairness*.  

### Experimental Setup  
- **Models:** Finetune InkubaLM and Glot500 on 5 low-resource languages.  
- **Baselines:** Compare against vanilla SHAP/LIME and state-of-the-art multilingual explainers (e.g., Polyglot-X).  
- **Languages:** Focus on isiZulu, Quechua, Navajo, Bambara, and Sundanese, covering diverse morphological typologies.  

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Anticipated Outcomes  
1. **Technical Contributions:**  
   - Open-source toolkit for morphology-aware and code-switching explanations.  
   - Novel metrics for evaluating cross-linguistic explanation consistency.  

2. **Community Artifacts:**  
   - Culturally adapted interface templates (e.g., proverbial explanations for Bantu languages).  
   - Guidelines for participatory LM auditing in low-resource settings.  

3. **Empirical Insights:**  
   - Quantitative evidence linking explanation design to user trust (target: +40% task success rate vs. baseline).  
   - Case studies demonstrating reduced bias in 3/5 target languages.  

### Broader Impact  
This work directly addresses the SoLaR workshop’s focus on equity and transparency. By bridging technical interpretability methods with community sensibilities, it provides a blueprint for deploying LMs that are **accountable to the populations they serve**. The tools and frameworks developed will empower speakers of low-resource languages to engage actively in model refinement, fostering a more inclusive NLP ecosystem.
