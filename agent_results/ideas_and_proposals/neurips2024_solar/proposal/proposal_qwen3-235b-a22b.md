# Interpretable Language Models for Low-Resource Languages: Enhancing Transparency and Equity  

## Introduction  

### Background and Context  
Language models (LMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), enabling breakthroughs in machine translation, question answering, and code generation. However, these advancements have disproportionately benefited high-resource languages like English, Mandarin, and Spanish, while over 3,000 low-resource languages remain underserved [1]. Recent efforts—such as *InkubaLM* for African languages [1] and *Glot500* spanning 511 languages [2]—have demonstrated that effective LMs can be developed with limited data through optimized architectures and training strategies. Despite these technical advances, critical gaps persist in **interpretability** (i.e., understanding why models make specific predictions) and **equitable deployment** for marginalized linguistic communities. Without actionable explanations, users in low-resource contexts face heightened risks of bias, inaccuracy, and exclusion, undermining trust and ethical use [3].  

### Research Objectives  
This research proposes a framework for **Interpretable Language Models for Low-Resource Languages (ILM-LowResource)**, combining technical innovations with community-driven validation. The objectives are:  
1. Adapt local explanation techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to capture linguistic features unique to low-resource languages (e.g., morphology, code-switching).  
2. Co-design **culturally aligned explanation interfaces** with native speakers to ensure intuitive transparency.  
3. Establish evaluation metrics quantifying both **technical robustness** and **user-perceived trust**.  
4. Release open-source tools for model introspection and community-driven refinement.  

### Significance  
By addressing interpretability gaps, this work directly contributes to socially responsible AI as emphasized by the SoLaR workshop. Transparent LMs enable marginalized communities to: (a) audit models for biases in sensitive applications like education or healthcare [9], (b) refine errors arising from low-quality training data [4], and (c) align NLP systems with cultural and linguistic norms. This aligns with global initiatives promoting multilingualism (UNESCO’s 2021 AI ethics recommendation) and bridges the digital divide in AI.

## Methodology  

### Research Design Framework  
The ILM-LowResource framework consists of three iterative phases: (1) linguistic feature adaptation, (2) community-driven interface design, and (3) robust evaluation (Figure 1). Each phase integrates technical and participatory elements to ensure both precision and cultural relevance.  

#### Phase 1: Adapting Local Explanations for Linguistic Features  
Low-resource languages often exhibit distinctive features absent in high-resource datasets:  
- **Morphological complexity** (e.g., agglutination in Bantu languages [8]).  
- **Code-switching** (e.g., mixing Arabic and French in North Africa [9]).  
- **Sparse syntactic patterns** (e.g., non-standard sentence structures in endangered languages).  

**Technical Strategy**  
1. **Morpheme-aware SHAP**: Extend SHAP to treat morphemes as interpretable units instead of tokens. For agglutinative languages like Swahili, decompose words into morphemes (e.g., *nikapendekekea* → *ni* [I] + *kapendekekea* [recommendations]) using morphology analyzers [3]. Let $ \psi(x) $ denote morpheme decomposition of input $ x $. The SHAP value for token $ t $ becomes:  
$$ \text{SHAP}_t = \sum_{m_i \in \psi(t)} \text{Shapley}(\phi_{m_i}, S), $$  
where $ \phi_{m_i} $ is feature importance and $ S $ is a subset of features.  
2. **Code-switching attention**: Modify the attention mechanism in LMs to flag code-switched segments. For example, train a lightweight classifier $ g(\cdot) $ to detect language switches in input $ x $:  
$$ g(x_i) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if token } x_i \text{ belongs to } l_j \neq l_k \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}, $$  
where $ l_j $ and $ l_k $ are adjacent languages.  
3. **Dynamic tokenization**: Develop a language-specific tokenizer that prioritizes frequent morphemes (for agglutinative languages) or multilingual vocabularies (for high code-switching rates).  

**Data Collection**  
- Use corpora from *Glot500* [2] and *InkubaLM* [1], focusing on 5–10 African, South Asian, and Indigenous American languages.  
- Collaborate with native speakers to curate code-switched data (e.g., transcripts from multilingual social media interactions).  

#### Phase 2: Community-Driven Interface Design  
Interpretable models must resonate with users’ cultural expectations. Prior work found that technical explanations (e.g., saliency maps) often fail to align with non-technical users' mental models [6].  

**Participatory Design Process**  
1. **Co-creation workshops**: Partner with 3–5 native speaker communities (e.g., isiXhosa, Quechua, Tamazight) to identify communication preferences (e.g., visual metaphors, storytelling norms).  
2. **Prototype interfaces**: Build low-fidelity prototypes (e.g., color-coded morpheme highlighting, code-switching timelines) and refine iteratively using feedback.  
3. **Validation metrics**: Quantify alignment between interface outputs and community norms via task success rates (e.g., correcting model errors) and qualitative interviews.  

**Example Interface Features**  
- **Morpheme explanation popups**: Hovering over a word displays decomposed morphemes and their contributions.  
- **Code-switching heatmaps**: Visualize transitions between languages in a text using gradient colors.  

#### Phase 3: Robust Evaluation Strategy  
Evaluate ILM-LowResource using two complementary paradigms:  

**Technical Robustness Metrics**:  
- **Perturbation stability**: Measure output consistency under random noise injection. Let $ y = f(x) $ and $ y' = f(x + \epsilon) $, where $ \epsilon \sim \mathcal{U}(-a, a) $. Stability $ S $ is:  
$$ S = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{||\epsilon||} \int_{0}^{||\epsilon||} \left| f(x_i) - f(x_i + \delta v_i) \right| d\delta. $$  
- **Fidelity score**: Compare explanations $ E_i $ with ground truth labels $ T_i $ using cosine similarity (Sim):  
$$ F = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Sim}(E_i, T_i)}{n}. $$  

**User-Perceived Trust Metrics**:  
- **Survey instruments**: Adapt the validated trust scale from [7], measuring dimensions like “transparency” and “reliability” on a 5-point Likert scale.  
- **Task-based trials**: Measure time-to-complete tasks (e.g., correcting a mistranslation) with and without explanations.  

**Benchmarking**  
- Baseline models: Compare with *Glot500* [2] and *InkubaLM* [1].  
- Evaluation datasets: Include both standard benchmarks (e.g., Flores for translation) and community-validated low-resource tasks (e.g., legal document summarization in Quechua).

## Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Technical Deliverables  
1. An open-source library (*ILM-Toolkit*) for morpheme-aware SHAP, code-switching detection, and tokenizer customization, compatible with HuggingFace Transformers.  
2. A corpus of 200+ annotated explanations in 5+ low-resource languages, released with permissive licenses for audit and retraining.  
3. Community-approved guidelines for culturally grounded explainability, codifying design patterns (e.g., “use timelines for sequential code-switching patterns” or “avoid abstract metaphors in favor of literal representations”).  

### Ethical and Social Impact  
- **Reduced bias risks**: By surfacing morpheme- or token-level errors, communities can identify and mitigate harmful outputs (e.g., misgendering in Bantu languages [12]).  
- **Empowerment**: Local stakeholders gain tools to refine models without relying on external researchers, addressing power imbalances in NLP development.  
- **Global equity**: Transparent LMs enable equitable deployment in education (e.g., multilingual chatbots for rural schools [16]) and healthcare (e.g., symptom checkers in Indigenous languages [31]).  

### Theoretical Contributions  
This work advances four frontiers:  
1. **Language-specific XAI**: Novel adaptation of SHAP/LIME for morphological and sociolinguistic features.  
2. **Community-in-the-loop design**: Framework for participatory NLP tool development.  
3. **Multilingual robustness metrics**: Evaluation benchmarks combining technical and human-centered criteria.  
4. **Ethical deployment pathways**: Demonstrates compliance with AI ethics guidelines (e.g., transparency, stakeholder participation).  

### Dissemination and Broader Impact  
- Publish results in venues aligned with SoLaR’s mission (e.g., *ACL Workshops on Ethics in NLP*).  
- Host workshops in partnering communities to democratize access to LM interpretability.  
- Collaborate with UNESCO and local governments to integrate findings into language preservation policies.  

By bridging the gap between technical innovation and social responsibility, ILM-LowResource will set a benchmark for equitable AI development in underrepresented linguistic landscapes.
