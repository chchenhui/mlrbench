1. **Title**: Enhancing Conversational Agents with Theory of Mind: Aligning Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions for Human-Like Interaction (arXiv:2502.14171)
   - **Authors**: Mehdi Jafari, Devin Yuncheng Hua, Hao Xue, Flora Salim
   - **Summary**: This study examines the extent to which open-source language models can capture and preserve Theory of Mind (ToM) related information and how effectively it contributes to consistent ToM reasoning in generated responses. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating ToM-informed alignment improves response quality, highlighting the potential of ToM-driven strategies to enhance alignment in large language model-based conversational agents.

    - **Year**: 2023

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Data Annotation Complexity**: Accurately annotating dialogues with latent mental states (e.g., beliefs, desires, intentions) is labor-intensive and subjective, posing challenges for training robust ToM models.

2. **Generalization Across Users**: Developing models that can generalize ToM capabilities across diverse user profiles and contexts remains difficult, limiting the scalability of personalized conversational agents.

3. **Balancing Adaptation Speed and Stability**: Ensuring that ToM modules can rapidly adapt to new users while maintaining stability and avoiding overfitting is a significant challenge in meta-learning approaches.

4. **Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks**: Establishing standardized and reliable metrics for assessing ToM capabilities in conversational agents is essential but currently underdeveloped, hindering consistent evaluation.

5. **Ethical and Privacy Concerns**: Incorporating ToM into conversational agents raises ethical questions regarding user privacy and the potential for manipulation, necessitating careful consideration and regulation.
