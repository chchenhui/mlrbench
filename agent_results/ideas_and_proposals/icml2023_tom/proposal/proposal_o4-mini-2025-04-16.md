1. Title  
Meta-Theory: A Meta-Learning Framework for Rapid Theory of Mind Adaptation in Conversational AI

2. Introduction  
Background  
Theory of Mind (ToM)—the capacity to infer others’ beliefs, desires, intentions, and knowledge states—has long been recognized as central to human social intelligence. In human–computer interaction, endowing conversational agents with ToM capabilities promises more contextually appropriate, personalized, and trustworthy dialogue. However, existing dialogue systems tend to apply generic user modeling or rely on large, static user profiles. They struggle to flexibly infer an individual user’s latent mental states (e.g., beliefs, goals, knowledge gaps) from limited interactions, leading to bland or misaligned responses that reduce user satisfaction and task success.

Recent work has made important strides. Jafari et al. (2025) demonstrate that ToM-informed alignment improves large language model (LLM) responses by preserving mental-state representations. Cross et al. (2024) introduce Hypothetical Minds, which uses LLMs to hypothesize and refine other agents’ strategies in multi-agent reinforcement settings. SymbolicToM (Sclar et al., 2023) tracks multi-character beliefs via graph representations, boosting zero-shot ToM reasoning. Meta-learning approaches, such as Purple & Orange (2023) and Johnson & Lee (2024), show that Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) can yield rapid user personalization. Nonetheless, comprehensive end-to-end frameworks that (i) pretrain a light ToM module on synthetic dialogue corpora with explicit state annotations, (ii) meta-learn its rapid adaptation to new users, and (iii) jointly optimize ToM inference with response generation remain underexplored.

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to design, implement, and evaluate “Meta-Theory,” a meta-learning framework that equips conversational agents with a lightweight ToM module capable of few-shot adaptation to individual users. Our key objectives are:  
1. Construct a large synthetic multi-turn dialogue corpus annotated with latent mental states (beliefs, goals, knowledge) using a controllable simulator and human-in-the-loop refinement.  
2. Develop an end-to-end architecture that integrates a ToM inference module with a neural generation backbone.  
3. Pretrain the ToM module on the synthetic data and meta-train it using MAML so that it can rapidly adapt its inference parameters using only a handful of user‐specific dialogue turns.  
4. Deploy the model in both simulated benchmarks (e.g., ToMi) and live user studies to measure adaptation speed, task success, perceived empathy, and alignment.  

Significance  
By achieving these objectives, Meta-Theory will (a) set a new standard for personalized, socially aware dialogue systems, (b) demonstrate the utility of meta-learning for rapid ToM acquisition, and (c) provide benchmarks and metrics that advance the evaluation of ToM capabilities in NLP. Such advances promise improved user satisfaction, efficiency in human–AI collaboration, and a foundation for responsible and explainable conversational agents.

3. Methodology  
Our methodology comprises four components: data collection and annotation, model architecture, meta-learning procedure, and experimental design.

3.1 Data Collection and Annotation  
We will generate a synthetic corpus of $N_{\text{syn}}=500{,}000$ multi‐turn dialogues using a simulator that models user–system exchanges across diverse contexts (e.g., task‐oriented booking, information seeking, collaborative problem solving). For each turn, the simulator assigns latent mental‐state labels: belief $b_t$, goal $g_t$, and knowledge state $k_t$ of the user.  

• Simulator design: We adapt a probabilistic user model that samples user intents $g_0$ from a predefined set, samples belief updates via Bayesian filtering over system actions, and generates utterances via a templated LLM with controlled variability.  
• Human-in-the-loop annotation: A subset (10 %) of dialogues is refined by crowd workers who correct and extend mental-state labels, ensuring high‐quality supervision.  

Each dialogue yields a sequence $\{(u_t, s_t, m_t)\}_{t=1}^T$, where $u_t$ is the user utterance, $s_t$ the system utterance, and $m_t=(b_t,g_t,k_t)$ the annotated mental state.

3.2 Model Architecture  
Meta-Theory consists of two modules:  

A. ToM Inference Module $f_\theta$  
• Input: Dialogue context $c_t = [(u_1, s_1), \dots, (u_{t-1}, s_{t-1}), u_t]$.  
• Encoder: A pretrained transformer (e.g., BERT or T5 encoder) maps $c_t$ to hidden states $h_t$.  
• Mental‐state predictors: Three MLP heads produce distributions over discrete belief states $\hat{b}_t = \mathrm{softmax}(W_b h_t + b_b)$, goals $\hat{g}_t$, and knowledge gaps $\hat{k}_t$.  
• Parameters: $\theta = \{\text{transformer encoder weights}, W_b, W_g, W_k\}$.  

B. Response Generation Module $g_\phi$  
• Input: Context $c_t$ and inferred or ground‐truth mental‐state embedding $\tilde{m}_t$ (concatenation of predicted or true one‐hot vectors).  
• Decoder: A transformer‐based decoder (initializing from T5 or GPT-2) generates the system response $s_t$.  
• Parameters: $\phi$.  

3.3 Pretraining and Meta-Training  
Stage 1: Supervised Pretraining  
We train $f_\theta$ on the synthetic corpus to minimize the cross‐entropy loss  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{pre}}(\theta) \;=\; \frac{1}{N_{\text{syn}}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{syn}}}\sum_{t=1}^{T_i}\Big[ -\log p(b_t^{(i)}\mid c_t^{(i)};\theta)
-\log p(g_t^{(i)}\mid c_t^{(i)};\theta)
-\log p(k_t^{(i)}\mid c_t^{(i)};\theta)\Big].
$$  
Simultaneously, we train $g_\phi$ to recover the system utterance via standard teacher‐forcing cross‐entropy on tokens, conditioned on true $m_t$:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{gen}}(\phi) \;=\; \frac{1}{N_{\text{syn}}}\sum_{i,t}-\log p(s_t^{(i)}\mid c_t^{(i)},\,m_t^{(i)};\phi).
$$  

Stage 2: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)  
To equip $f_\theta$ with rapid adaptation, we apply MAML on a collection of meta‐tasks. Each meta‐task $\mathcal{T}_i$ corresponds to a simulated “user profile” drawn from the synthetic corpus. We split each task’s dialogues into $K$–shot support set $\mathcal{D}_i^{\text{S}}$ (e.g., $K=5$ turns) and query set $\mathcal{D}_i^{\text{Q}}$. The MAML update proceeds as:  

Inner update for task $\mathcal{T}_i$:  
$$
\theta_i' = \theta - \alpha\,\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}^{\text{S}}(\theta),
$$  
where $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}^{\text{S}}$ is the sum of cross‐entropy mental‐state losses over $\mathcal{D}_i^{\text{S}}$.  

Meta update:  
$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta - \beta\,\nabla_\theta \sum_i \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}^{\text{Q}}(\theta_i').
$$  

We interleave meta-updates with joint fine‐tuning of $\phi$, allowing the generator to adapt to improved ToM predictions.  

3.4 Deployment and Joint Inference  
At deployment, given a new user, we observe an initial support set of $K$ exchanges. We perform the inner MAML update on $f_\theta$ to obtain $\theta_{\text{user}}'$. Thereafter, at each turn we:  
1. Inference: Compute $\hat{m}_t = f_{\theta_{\text{user}}'}(c_t)$.  
2. Generation: Produce $s_t \sim g_\phi(c_t, \hat{m}_t)$.  
3. Optional online refinement: Incorporate $(c_t, u_{t+1})$ into a streaming support set and occasionally fine‐tune $\theta_{\text{user}}'$ to handle distributional shifts.

3.5 Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics  
Benchmarks  
• ToMi Benchmark (White & Brown, 2023): Evaluate zero- and few-shot belief tracking, goal inference, and response coherence.  
• Hypothetical Minds tasks (Cross et al., 2024): Multi‐agent reasoning environments adapted for dialogue.  
• Live user study: Recruit 50 participants for a task‐oriented conversation (e.g., flight booking), collecting 20 turns each.  

Metrics  
1. Adaptation Speed: Task performance (accuracy of mental-state prediction and dialogue success) as a function of $K$ (number of support turns).  
2. ToM Inference Accuracy: F1 score on belief/goal/knowledge labels on held-out synthetic and human-annotated data.  
3. Generation Quality: BLEU, ROUGE, and human ratings of relevance and coherence.  
4. Perceived Empathy and Trust: Post-conversation questionnaires (Likert scale) measuring user satisfaction, perceived understanding, and trust in the agent.  
5. Task Success Rate: Percentage of successful completions in task‐oriented scenarios (e.g., booking correctly).  

Ablations  
– Without meta-learning (pure pretraining).  
– Without joint generation fine‐tuning.  
– Varying $K$ from 1 to 20.  
– Replacing synthetic pretraining with fine‐tuned LLMs.  

Hyperparameters and Implementation Details  
• Transformer sizes: 12‐layer encoder/decoder, hidden dim 768.  
• Inner‐loop LR $\alpha=1e^{-3}$, meta‐LR $\beta=1e^{-4}$.  
• Batch of 32 meta-tasks per update; 5‐shot support; query set size 20.  
• Training on 8 A100 GPUs; early stopping on validation ToM accuracy.  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Expected Outcomes  
1. Demonstration that Meta-Theory yields significantly faster adaptation (≥20 % reduction in shots to reach 90 % mental‐state accuracy) compared to non-meta baselines (pretrained only) and standard fine-tuning.  
2. Improved dialogue quality: +15 % in human‐rated relevance and +10 % in perceived empathy over LLM baselines without explicit ToM adaptation.  
3. Robust generalization across domains: effective transfer from synthetic to real user dialogues with minimal performance drop.  
4. Open‐source release of the synthetic annotated corpus, Meta-Theory codebase (PyTorch), and evaluation scripts to facilitate reproducible research.

Broader Impact  
Personalized, socially aware conversational agents have the potential to transform HCI across education, healthcare, customer support, and assistive technologies. By rapidly inferring user mental states, Meta-Theory can yield more effective tutoring bots that adapt to learners’ misconceptions, empathetic companions for mental health support, and efficient customer service agents that anticipate user needs.  

Ethical Considerations  
We will adopt privacy‐preserving protocols: all user data in live studies will be anonymized; mental‐state inferences will not be stored beyond session boundaries without consent. We will conduct an ethical review of potential risks of manipulative uses of ToM reasoning and propose guidelines for responsible deployment, including transparency mechanisms that inform users when inference is taking place.
