**Title:** Enhancing Synthetic Medical Data Realism with Pathology-Aware Diffusion Models  

**Motivation:**  
Synthetic medical data generation faces challenges in balancing data privacy, pathological accuracy, and distribution shifts. Current methods often produce images lacking domain-specific pathology (e.g., tumors, lesions) or misrepresent minority populations, limiting their utility in addressing data scarcity for rare diseases or underrepresented groups. Improving realism and clinical plausibility is critical for enabling training, benchmarking, and equitable healthcare solutions.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a pathology-aware diffusion model that integrates multimodal priors (e.g., segmentation masks, pathology reports) into the denoising process, ensuring generated images reflect clinically relevant features and severity levels. By refining the forward diffusion schedule to preserve fine-grained diagnostic details (e.g., tumor texture in MRI) and leveraging large-scale pre-trained language-image models (e.g., CLIP) for text-conditioned synthesis, the framework will yield high-fidelity, diverse samples. To mitigate biases, the model will be optimized on datasets balanced for demographics and pathology prevalence, validated through clinician evaluations, downstream segmentation task performance, and distribution alignment metrics (e.g., MMD-MAE). Expected outcomes include improved augmentation strategies for critical care (e.g., ICU imaging scarcity) and robust generation for rare disease groups like pediatric oncology. This could reduce data acquisition bottlenecks while enhancing accountability in clinical AI systems.
