### Title: Scalable Hyperparameter Optimization for Large Language Models

### Motivation
The training of large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive and time-consuming, often requiring substantial computational resources and energy. Efficient hyperparameter optimization is crucial for scaling up LLMs, as it can significantly reduce training time and costs, and minimize the environmental impact of AI. Existing methods often struggle with the complexity and scale of LLMs, necessitating innovative approaches that can adapt to model size dependencies.

### Main Idea
Develop a novel adaptive hyperparameter optimization framework tailored for large language models. The proposed method will leverage model size-dependent learning rates and dynamically adjust hyperparameters such as width, depth, and batch size to minimize loss functions while adhering to fixed compute budgets. The methodology will involve:
1. **Model Size Analysis**: Analyze the relationship between model size and convergence rates using empirical data from smaller models.
2. **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling**: Implement a learning rate scheduler that extrapolates learning rates from smaller models to larger ones, facilitating efficient fine-tuning.
3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Utilize a combination of classical optimization techniques and modern machine learning approaches to adaptively select optimal hyperparameters.
4. **Scalability Testing**: Evaluate the effectiveness of the framework on various LLM architectures and sizes, comparing performance against traditional methods.

Expected outcomes include:
- **Time and Cost Efficiency**: Significant reduction in training time and computational costs.
- **Environmental Impact**: Reduced energy consumption, contributing to more sustainable AI practices.
- **Generalization**: Improved generalization capabilities by optimizing hyperparameters for specific model sizes.

Potential impact:
- **Industry Adoption**: Wide adoption in industry for scaling up LLM training.
- **Research Advancements**: Contribution to the broader understanding of scaling laws and optimization in large-scale machine learning.
- **Environmental Sustainability**: Reduced carbon footprint of AI training processes.
