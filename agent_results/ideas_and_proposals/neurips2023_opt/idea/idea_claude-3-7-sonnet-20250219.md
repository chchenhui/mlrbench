# Adaptive Learning Rate Scaling for Efficient LLM Training

## Motivation
Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is extremely resource-intensive, with costs often reaching millions of dollars and significant environmental impact. Current approaches to scaling model training often use heuristic learning rate schedules that aren't systematically derived from model size relationships. This leads to inefficient hyperparameter searches and sub-optimal convergence rates. Developing theoretical and practical frameworks to predict optimal learning rates as a function of model size could dramatically reduce training costs and enable more efficient scaling of AI systems.

## Main Idea
We propose a systematic approach to derive adaptive learning rate scaling laws based on model architecture and size. Our method integrates spectral analysis of the Hessian with empirical observations across different model scales to establish mathematical relationships between optimal learning rates and model dimensions (width, depth, parameter count). By training a series of models at smaller scales and analyzing convergence patterns, we can extrapolate learning rate schedules for larger models, eliminating costly hyperparameter searches. The approach incorporates architecture-specific adjustments, allowing precise learning rate predictions for transformers of arbitrary size. Initial experiments suggest this could reduce training time by 25-40% for billion-parameter models while maintaining or improving final performance. This framework would be implemented as an open-source library compatible with popular deep learning frameworks.
