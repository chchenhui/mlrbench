## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **Predictive Learning Rate Scaling for Efficient Large Language Model Training: An Empirical and Spectral Approach**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language tasks. However, training these models represents a significant computational undertaking, often demanding millions of dollars in hardware resources, considerable energy consumption, and extensive engineering effort (Strubell et al., 2019; Patterson et al., 2021). A critical bottleneck in this process is the optimization procedure, particularly the selection and tuning of hyperparameters like the learning rate (LR). The learning rate dictates the step size taken during gradient descent and profoundly impacts convergence speed, stability, and the final performance of the trained model.

Current practices for setting the LR often rely on heuristics, prior experience with similar models, or computationally expensive hyperparameter optimization (HPO) searches (e.g., grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization). While effective for smaller models, these approaches become prohibitively costly when scaling to models with billions or trillions of parameters. The sheer scale of LLMs necessitates novel optimization strategies that minimize the need for exhaustive tuning. The OPT 2024 workshop theme, "Scaling up optimization," directly calls for research addressing these challenges, emphasizing the need to understand the relationship between optimization, model scale, and performance. Recent work has begun exploring "scaling laws" â€“ predictable relationships between model size, dataset size, compute, and performance (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022). Extending this paradigm to optimization hyperparameters, particularly the learning rate, holds immense potential for streamlining LLM training.

**2.2 Research Problem and Gap**
While initial studies have proposed scaling laws for hyperparameters (Li et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2024; Bjorck et al., 2024), several gaps remain. Many existing approaches focus on empirical correlations between macro-level properties (total parameters, dataset size) and optimal hyperparameters, often deriving power-law relationships. However, a deeper, mechanistic understanding connecting these scaling laws to the underlying model architecture and the optimization landscape dynamics is often lacking. Specifically, the influence of architectural choices (e.g., ratio of width to depth, type of attention mechanism, normalization layers) on the optimal LR schedule is not fully captured by simple parameter counts. Furthermore, while spectral properties of the Hessian matrix (e.g., maximum eigenvalue) are known theoretically to influence optimal step sizes in classical optimization, their systematic integration into practical LR scaling laws for deep neural networks, especially LLMs, remains underexplored. Current methods may also struggle with generalization across diverse architectures or require significant compute to establish the initial law. There is a need for a systematic framework that integrates empirical observations across various model scales with theoretical insights from optimization (like spectral analysis) to derive *predictive* and *architecture-aware* LR scaling laws, thereby drastically reducing the HPO burden for large-scale models.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
This research aims to develop and validate a novel methodology for deriving adaptive, predictive learning rate scaling laws for efficient LLM training. Our specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Systematic Framework:** Establish a methodology for training a series of LLMs at increasing scales (parameter count, width, depth) on benchmark datasets, meticulously tracking convergence dynamics and identifying optimal learning rates for each scale.
2.  **Integrate Spectral Analysis:** Investigate the relationship between the spectral properties (e.g., maximum eigenvalue, eigenvalue distribution) of the training loss Hessian and the optimal learning rate across different model sizes and architectures. Develop methods for efficiently estimating relevant spectral properties during training.
3.  **Formulate Predictive Scaling Laws:** Derive mathematical models (e.g., extensions of power laws) that predict the optimal learning rate (initial LR, schedule decay parameters) as a function of model size (N), key architectural parameters (e.g., width W, depth D), and potentially spectral characteristics. The goal is $\eta^* = f(N, W, D, \text{spectral features})$.
4.  **Empirical Validation:** Validate the predictive accuracy of the derived scaling laws by using them to set the learning rates for training significantly larger LLMs *without* extensive HPO. Compare the performance (convergence speed, final loss, downstream task accuracy) and computational cost against standard HPO methods and existing scaling law approaches.
5.  **Develop an Open-Source Tool:** Implement the proposed framework as a practical, open-source library compatible with major deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, JAX) to facilitate its adoption by the research community.

**2.4 Significance**
Successfully achieving these objectives will yield significant scientific and practical contributions.
*   **Scientific Advancement:** This work will deepen our understanding of optimization dynamics in large neural networks, potentially uncovering fundamental relationships between model architecture, the loss landscape geometry (via spectral analysis), and optimal learning strategies. It contributes directly to the emerging field of scaling laws in machine learning.
*   **Economic and Environmental Impact:** By enabling accurate prediction of optimal learning rates, our framework aims to reduce the extensive HPO phase for LLMs, leading to substantial savings in computational resources (potentially 25-40% reduction in tuning time/cost based on initial estimates), GPU hours, and associated energy consumption. This aligns with the increasing need for sustainable AI development.
*   **Democratization of Research:** Reducing the computational barrier for training large models can enable smaller research labs and institutions to participate more effectively in cutting-edge LLM research.
*   **Practical Tools:** The open-source library will provide practitioners with a valuable tool for efficient LLM training, accelerating development cycles and improving model performance.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Research Design**
This research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining systematic empirical investigation with theoretical insights from optimization. The core idea is to leverage data from training smaller models to build a predictive model for the optimal LR of larger ones, incorporating both macroscopic features (size, architecture) and microscopic indicators (spectral properties). The methodology involves the following key phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Small-to-Medium Scale Empirical Study & Spectral Analysis:** Train a diverse set of LLMs at controlled, smaller scales and analyze their training dynamics and Hessian spectra.
2.  **Phase 2: Scaling Law Formulation:** Develop and fit mathematical models relating optimal LR to model characteristics based on Phase 1 data.
3.  **Phase 3: Large-Scale Validation:** Use the derived scaling laws to predict LRs for larger models and validate their effectiveness.
4.  **Phase 4: Tool Development & Dissemination:** Package the methodology into an open-source library.

**3.2 Data Collection and Preparation**
We will utilize standard, large-scale text corpora commonly used for LLM pretraining, such as subsets of C4 (Common Crawl Cleaned Corpus) or The Pile. Using standardized datasets ensures comparability with existing literature. Data preprocessing will follow standard practices (e.g., tokenization using SentencePiece or BPE). The amount of training data (number of tokens) will be kept proportional to the model size based on established scaling principles (e.g., Chinchilla scaling laws by Hoffmann et al., 2022) or varied systematically in specific experiments to understand its interaction with LR scaling.

**3.3 Model Architectures and Scales**
We will focus primarily on the Transformer architecture, the foundation of most modern LLMs.
*   **Architectural Variations:** We will include standard decoder-only Transformer architectures (similar to GPT models) and potentially explore variations (e.g., different normalization layers like LayerNorm vs. RMSNorm, different attention mechanisms if feasible).
*   **Scaling Dimensions:** We will systematically vary model size along key dimensions:
    *   Number of parameters ($N$): Ranging from tens of millions (e.g., ~50M) up to several billion parameters (e.g., 1-7B) for the initial study (Phase 1) and validation (Phase 3).
    *   Model Width ($W$): Embedding dimension / hidden size.
    *   Model Depth ($D$): Number of layers.
    We will create families of models where $N$, $W$, and $D$ are varied systematically (e.g., fixing $D$ and scaling $W$, fixing $W$ and scaling $D$, or scaling both according to common practices like $W \propto \sqrt{N}, D \propto \sqrt{N}$). This allows isolating the effects of different scaling dimensions.

**3.4 Phase 1: Empirical Study and Spectral Analysis**
*   **Training Setup:** For each model configuration (size, architecture) in the small-to-medium range, we will perform pretraining runs using the AdamW optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014; Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019), which is standard for LLMs. Other hyperparameters (batch size, weight decay, dropout rate, learning rate schedule type - e.g., cosine decay) will be carefully controlled.
*   **Optimal LR Determination:** For each small/medium model, the "optimal" initial learning rate ($\eta^*$) will be identified using efficient HPO techniques (e.g., Bayesian optimization or fine-grained grid search over a logarithmic scale) based on achieving the lowest validation loss after a fixed number of training steps or compute budget. We will primarily focus on the initial learning rate, but may also analyze scaling properties of decay parameters.
*   **Spectral Property Estimation:** During or after training (at specific checkpoints), we will estimate key properties of the Hessian matrix ($H = \nabla^2 \mathcal{L}(\theta)$) of the training loss $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to the model parameters $\theta$. Due to the high dimensionality, we will use iterative methods:
    *   **Maximum Eigenvalue ($\lambda_{max}$):** Estimated using the Power Iteration method or the Lanczos algorithm, which only require Hessian-vector products ($\mathbf{H}\mathbf{v}$). These products can be computed efficiently using automatic differentiation techniques (Pearlmutter, 1994).
    *   **Eigenvalue Distribution (Density):** Approximated using the Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature method (Ubaru et al., 2017) to understand the concentration of eigenvalues.
    *   **Trace of the Hessian:** Estimated using Hutchinson's method (Avron & Toledo, 2011).
    We will track how these spectral properties evolve during training and how their typical values (e.g., $\lambda_{max}$ near convergence) correlate with model size ($N, W, D$) and the empirically determined optimal LR ($\eta^*$). Our hypothesis is that $\eta^* \propto 1 / \lambda_{max}$, and we aim to model how $\lambda_{max}$ itself scales with $N, W, D$.

**3.5 Phase 2: Scaling Law Formulation**
*   **Data Aggregation:** We will collect the data points $(N_i, W_i, D_i, \lambda_{max, i}, ..., \eta^*_i)$ for each model $i$ configuration from Phase 1.
*   **Model Fitting:** We will propose and fit functional forms relating the optimal LR to the model characteristics. Potential models include:
    *   **Enhanced Power Laws:** Extending simple power laws $\eta^* = c N^{-\alpha}$ to include width and depth dependencies, e.g.,
        $$ \eta^*(N, W, D) = c N^{-\alpha} W^{-\beta} D^{-\gamma} $$
        or incorporating aspect ratios like $W/D$.
    *   **Spectral-Informed Laws:** Explicitly incorporating estimated spectral properties, assuming $\lambda_{max}$ acts as a primary scaling factor:
        $$ \eta^*(N, W, D) \approx \frac{k}{\lambda_{max}(N, W, D)} $$
        where we separately model the scaling of $\lambda_{max}(N, W, D)$ using power laws or other functions based on the empirical findings.
    *   **Combined Models:** Using regression techniques (e.g., multivariate non-linear regression) to find the best fit combining size, architecture, and spectral features.
*   **Model Selection:** We will use standard statistical criteria (e.g., R-squared, AIC, BIC, cross-validation error) to select the most predictive and parsimonious scaling law model.

**3.6 Phase 3: Large-Scale Validation**
*   **Prediction:** Using the selected scaling law from Phase 2, we will predict the optimal initial learning rate $\eta^*_{pred}$ for several significantly larger LLM configurations (e.g., >10B parameters, if resources permit, or at the upper end of available resources).
*   **Validation Experiments:** We will train these large models using the predicted learning rate $\eta^*_{pred}$ and a standard schedule (e.g., cosine decay).
*   **Baselines for Comparison:**
    1.  **Standard HPO:** Perform a limited but costly HPO search (e.g., random search over a few points, or using Bayesian Optimization for a fixed budget) for the large model to estimate its true optimal LR ($\eta^*_{HPO}$).
    2.  **Heuristic LR:** Use a commonly used heuristic LR value or schedule for models of that size.
    3.  **Existing Scaling Laws:** If applicable and feasible to compute their predictions (e.g., based on Li et al. 2025 or Xie et al. 2024 if their tools/methods are accessible and relevant).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Convergence Speed:** Time (wall-clock, GPU hours) and number of training steps/tokens required to reach a predefined target validation loss.
    *   **Final Performance:** Validation loss and perplexity achieved after a fixed, large training budget (e.g., total FLOPS or tokens processed).
    *   **Downstream Task Performance:** Evaluate checkpoints from the training runs on a suite of downstream tasks (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE benchmarks) to assess generalization.
    *   **Cost Savings:** Quantify the reduction in computational cost (primarily HPO cost reduction, but also potentially faster convergence) compared to the Standard HPO baseline. We aim to demonstrate achieving performance close to $\eta^*_{HPO}$ with negligible tuning cost.

**3.7 Phase 4: Tool Development & Dissemination**
*   **Implementation:** Develop an open-source Python library built on PyTorch or JAX.
*   **Functionality:** The library will provide functions to:
    *   Estimate spectral properties (e.g., $\lambda_{max}$) efficiently during training.
    *   Input model configuration ($N, W, D$, potentially architecture type).
    *   Output a predicted optimal initial learning rate and potentially schedule parameters based on the pre-derived scaling laws. Allow users to potentially fine-tune laws based on their own small-scale runs.
*   **Dissemination:** Publish findings in top-tier ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS OPT workshop, ICML, NeurIPS main conference) and journals. Release the code publicly with documentation and examples.

In conclusion, this research proposes a principled and practical approach to tackle a critical challenge in large-scale machine learning. By integrating empirical scaling studies with spectral analysis, we aim to develop predictive learning rate scaling laws that significantly enhance the efficiency and sustainability of LLM training, directly contributing to the goals of the OPT 2024 workshop and the broader AI community.
