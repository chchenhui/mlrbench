**Title:** Physics-Informed Diffusion Models on Manifolds for Structure-Preserving Field Generation  

**Motivation:** Generating fields over manifolds (e.g., fluid flows on curved surfaces) requires adherence to both geometric constraints (to stay on-manifold) and physical laws (e.g., conservation principles). Current generative methods often address one aspect but neglect the other, leading to physically implausible or geometrically inconsistent outputs. This limits their utility in scientific domains like climate modeling or material design.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a diffusion model framework that jointly enforces geometric and physical structure. The denoising process is constrained to the manifoldâ€™s tangent bundle via manifold-aware score networks using equivariant layers, ensuring on-manifold generation. Physics-informed losses, derived from partial differential equations (e.g., Navier-Stokes on manifolds), are integrated into the training objective to penalize violations of physical laws. For example, generating fluid flows on a sphere would involve a score network operating on the tangent space of \( \mathbb{S}^2 \), coupled with losses enforcing divergence-free conditions. The method will be validated on synthetic and real-world tasks, such as generating turbulent flows on spherical geometries or electromagnetic fields on curved surfaces. Expected outcomes include improved geometric/physical fidelity compared to baseline models, with applications in simulation and data augmentation for scientific machine learning.
