## 1. Title

**GeoMotion: Manifold-Aware Robot Motion Planning with SE(3) Equivariant Encoders and Riemannian Trajectory Optimization**

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Background

Motion planning is a fundamental problem in robotics, enabling autonomous systems to navigate complex environments and perform tasks by generating feasible and efficient sequences of configurations from a start state to a goal state. Classical approaches often fall into two categories: sampling-based methods (e.g., Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM), Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)) and optimization-based methods (e.g., CHOMP, TrajOpt). While successful in many domains, sampling-based methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality and can be computationally expensive, especially in high-dimensional configuration spaces ($C$-spaces). Optimization-based methods can get trapped in local minima and often require careful initialization.

Recent advances in machine learning have spurred the development of learning-based motion planners. These approaches aim to leverage data to learn policies or heuristics that guide the search for paths, potentially offering faster planning times and better generalization compared to classical methods. Examples include learning cost functions, sampling distributions, or even end-to-end planning policies ([1], [3]). However, many learning-based methods often lack explicit grounding in the underlying geometry and physics of the robot and its environment. This can lead to several drawbacks: poor sample efficiency during training, failure to generalize to novel scenarios not well-represented in the training data, and difficulty in guaranteeing the physical plausibility or constraint satisfaction of the generated trajectories without adding complex regularization terms or post-processing steps ([5], Key Challenge 2 & 3).

The robotics and machine learning communities increasingly recognize that explicitly incorporating geometric structure is crucial for developing robust, efficient, and generalizable models ([Workshop Motivation]). This principle, often termed "geometry-grounded" learning, involves designing models that inherently respect the symmetries (e.g., SE(3) equivariance for rigid body motion [7]), manifold structures (e.g., representing rotations in SO(3) [6]), and dynamics of the physical world. Approaches leveraging geometric deep learning ([9]), manifold representations ([6], [10]), Riemannian geometry ([4], [8]), and equivariant architectures ([7]) have shown significant promise in various domains, including robotics.

### 2.2 Problem Statement

Despite progress, learning-based motion planning still faces significant challenges. High-dimensional $C$-spaces make learning efficient representations difficult (Key Challenge 1). Ensuring generalization to unseen environments remains a major hurdle (Key Challenge 2). Critically, encoding the robot's kinematic constraints and collision avoidance requirements in a way that is both computationally efficient and naturally integrated within the learning framework is non-trivial (Key Challenge 3). Many current learning methods treat the $C$-space implicitly as a Euclidean space or rely on generic neural network architectures that do not inherently capture its geometric properties (e.g., topology, curvature). This often necessitates large datasets for training and can lead to generated paths that are suboptimal or physically invalid, requiring costly collision checking or repair steps. There is a need for a motion planning framework that intrinsically leverages the geometric structure of the robot's $C$-space and its interaction with the environment, leading to improved efficiency, generalization, and inherent constraint satisfaction.

### 2.3 Research Objectives

This research aims to develop and validate **GeoMotion**, a novel learning-based motion planning framework grounded in geometric principles. The core idea is to induce geometric structure by representing the robot's free configuration space as a manifold and generating trajectories via optimization directly on this manifold. The specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop an SE(3) Equivariant Geometric Encoder:** Design and implement a neural network architecture that leverages SE(3) equivariance to efficiently map workspace obstacle information (e.g., point clouds) to a representation of the collision-free region within the robot's configuration space manifold ($Q_{free}$).
2.  **Formulate Riemannian Trajectory Generation:** Define the motion planning problem as finding an optimal path (approximating a geodesic) within the learned $Q_{free}$ manifold, equipped with a suitable Riemannian metric (e.g., derived from robot kinematics).
3.  **Implement Riemannian Optimization:** Develop an optimization algorithm based on Riemannian gradient descent or related techniques to efficiently compute the optimal trajectory directly on the manifold, inherently satisfying geometric constraints.
4.  **Integrate and Train the Framework:** Combine the geometric encoder and Riemannian trajectory generator into an end-to-end trainable pipeline (potentially a two-stage process).
5.  **Evaluate Performance and Generalization:** Systematically evaluate GeoMotion against state-of-the-art classical and learning-based motion planning algorithms in terms of planning efficiency, path quality (length, smoothness), success rate, and generalization capabilities to novel environments and robot configurations.

### 2.4 Significance

This research directly addresses the core themes of the Workshop on Geometry-grounded Representation Learning and Generative Modeling, specifically focusing on structure-inducing learning through geometric priors and computing with geometric representations on manifolds. By explicitly embedding the geometric structure of the $C$-space and leveraging SE(3) equivariance, GeoMotion is expected to offer several significant advantages over existing methods:

*   **Improved Sample Efficiency:** Equivariant architectures and manifold representations often require less data to learn generalizable mappings.
*   **Enhanced Generalization:** By learning representations that respect the inherent symmetries and structure of the problem, the model is expected to generalize better to unseen environments and robot poses.
*   **Inherent Constraint Satisfaction:** Formulating trajectory generation as optimization on the $C$-space manifold naturally handles kinematic constraints. The geometric encoder aims to directly define the feasible space, implicitly handling collision avoidance during optimization.
*   **Improved Path Quality:** Optimization on Riemannian manifolds naturally leads to smoother, more direct paths (geodesics) according to the chosen metric, often corresponding to physically meaningful trajectories (e.g., minimum kinetic energy).
*   **Computational Efficiency:** By guiding the search using learned geometric priors and optimizing directly on the relevant manifold, GeoMotion aims to significantly reduce planning time compared to exhaustive search or sampling methods (targeting the 60% reduction mentioned in the idea).

Success in this research would contribute a novel, principled approach to learning-based motion planning, advancing the integration of geometric deep learning and Riemannian optimization in robotics, potentially leading to more capable and reliable autonomous systems.

## 3. Methodology

This section details the proposed research design, including data representation, the algorithmic steps of the GeoMotion framework, and the experimental plan for validation.

### 3.1 Overall Framework

GeoMotion employs a two-stage architecture:

1.  **SE(3) Equivariant Geometric Encoder:** Takes the robot's kinematics and the workspace environment description as input and outputs a representation characterizing the free configuration space ($Q_{free}$) manifold, focusing on local collision information around potential path points.
2.  **Riemannian Trajectory Generator:** Takes the start configuration ($q_{start}$), goal configuration ($q_{goal}$), and the $Q_{free}$ representation from the encoder as input. It optimizes a discretized trajectory directly on the $C$-space manifold ($Q$) using Riemannian optimization techniques, constrained to remain within $Q_{free}$.

### 3.2 Data Representation and Manifold Definition

*   **Input Data:**
    *   Robot Model: Kinematic structure (Denavit-Hartenberg parameters or URDF), joint limits, self-collision model.
    *   Environment: Represented as a point cloud or mesh describing obstacles in the workspace ($\mathbb{R}^3$).
    *   Task: Start configuration $q_{start} \in Q$ and goal configuration $q_{goal} \in Q$.
*   **Configuration Space Manifold ($Q$):** The robot's configuration space $Q$ is explicitly treated as a Riemannian manifold. For a typical $n$-DOF manipulator, $Q$ is often a product space, e.g., $Q = (S^1)^k \times \mathbb{R}^{n-k}$ or involving $SO(3)$ components for free-flyer bases, $Q \subseteq SE(3) \times \mathbb{R}^k$. We will equip $Q$ with a Riemannian metric $G(q)$. A common choice is the mass matrix or inertia tensor $M(q)$, representing the kinetic energy metric: $G(q) = M(q)$. This metric relates joint velocities $\dot{q}$ to kinetic energy $E = \frac{1}{2} \dot{q}^T M(q) \dot{q}$.

### 3.3 Stage 1: SE(3) Equivariant Geometric Encoder

*   **Objective:** To learn a function that efficiently provides collision information relevant to the $C$-space manifold structure, leveraging the SE(3) symmetry of the underlying physics. Instead of explicitly mapping the entire $C_{obs}$, the encoder will learn a function $\phi: Q \times \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$, where $\mathcal{E}$ represents the environment encoding (e.g., features from the obstacle point cloud). $\phi(q, \mathcal{E})$ estimates the signed distance or a collision probability/cost at configuration $q$.
*   **Architecture:** We will utilize an SE(3) equivariant graph neural network (GNN) or a Tensor Field Network ([7]-like architecture).
    *   *Input:* The obstacle point cloud $P_{obs} = \{p_i \in \mathbb{R}^3\}_{i=1}^M$ and the robot's configuration $q$. The robot's geometry at configuration $q$ can also be represented as a point cloud $P_{robot}(q)$.
    *   *Processing:* The network will process the combined geometry of the robot and obstacles. Equivariant layers ensure that rotations and translations of the entire scene result in predictably transformed outputs. Specifically, if $g \in SE(3)$ acts on the workspace, the output related to configuration $g \cdot q$ should be consistently related to the output for configuration $q$. For instance, a scalar output like collision probability should be invariant: $\phi(g \cdot q, g \cdot \mathcal{E}) = \phi(q, \mathcal{E})$.
    *   *Output:* The function $\phi(q, \mathcal{E})$ which provides a differentiable measure of collision risk/distance for configuration $q$. This function acts as a potential field guiding the trajectory away from obstacles within the optimization phase.
*   **Training:** The encoder can be trained supervisedly using configuration-collision label pairs generated via traditional collision checkers, or potentially trained end-to-end with the trajectory generator using task success rewards (e.g., via reinforcement learning or imitation learning). We will initially focus on supervised pre-training for the collision prediction task.

### 3.4 Stage 2: Riemannian Trajectory Generator

*   **Objective:** Find a smooth, collision-free path $\gamma: [0, 1] \rightarrow Q_{free}$ between $q_{start}$ and $q_{goal}$ that minimizes a desired cost function, typically related to path length or energy.
*   **Trajectory Representation:** The trajectory $\gamma$ is discretized into $N+1$ points: $(q_0, q_1, ..., q_N)$, where $q_0 = q_{start}$ and $q_N = q_{goal}$. The optimization variables are the intermediate configurations $(q_1, ..., q_{N-1})$.
*   **Optimization Problem:** We formulate the problem as minimizing a cost functional $J(\gamma)$ subject to manifold and collision constraints:
    $$ \min_{q_1, ..., q_{N-1}} J(\gamma) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} L(q_i, q_{i+1}) + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} C_{coll}(q_i) $$
    Subject to: $q_i \in Q$ (respecting joint limits, implicitly handled by manifold definition or projection)

    Where:
    *   $L(q_i, q_{i+1})$ is the cost of the path segment between $q_i$ and $q_{i+1}$. Using the Riemannian metric $G(q)$, this can approximate the geodesic distance squared: $L(q_i, q_{i+1}) \approx d_G(q_i, q_{i+1})^2 = || \text{Log}_{q_i}(q_{i+1}) ||^2_{G(q_i)}$. The $\text{Log}_{q_i}$ map is the inverse of the Riemannian exponential map $\text{Exp}_{q_i}$.
    *   $C_{coll}(q_i)$ is a collision cost term derived from the geometric encoder's output $\phi$: e.g., $C_{coll}(q_i) = \max(0, \epsilon - \phi(q_i, \mathcal{E}))^2$ or $C_{coll}(q_i) = \text{ReLU}(-\phi(q_i, \mathcal{E}))$, penalizing configurations too close to or inside obstacles. $\lambda$ is a weighting factor.
    *   Joint limits can be incorporated either by defining $Q$ appropriately or adding them as constraints/penalties.
*   **Riemannian Optimization Algorithm:** We will employ a retraction-based optimization method (e.g., Riemannian Gradient Descent or Riemannian Adam).
    1.  Initialize path: e.g., a straight line in the ambient space projected onto the manifold, or a simple geodesic ignoring obstacles.
    2.  Compute Gradient: Calculate the gradient $\nabla J$ with respect to the path points $(q_1, ..., q_{N-1})$. This involves differentiating the path length term and the collision cost term. Crucially, the gradient computation must respect the manifold geometry. The gradient of the distance term $L(q_i, q_{i+1})$ involves derivatives of the Log map and the metric tensor $G(q)$. The gradient of $C_{coll}(q_i)$ involves the gradient of $\phi$ from the encoder, computed via backpropagation. The overall gradient for each $q_i$ is an element of the tangent space $T_{q_i}Q$.
    3.  Update Path Points: Update each intermediate point $q_i$ using a retraction operation $R_{q_i}$:
        $$ q_i^{(k+1)} = R_{q_i^{(k)}}(- \eta \nabla_{q_i} J^{(k)}) $$
        where $\eta$ is the step size (learning rate) and $R_{q_i}(v)$ maps a tangent vector $v \in T_{q_i}Q$ back to the manifold $Q$, approximating the exponential map $\text{Exp}_{q_i}(v)$. For product manifolds like $SO(3) \times \mathbb{R}^n$, retractions can be applied component-wise.
    4.  Iteration: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence (e.g., gradient norm below a threshold, cost stabilization) or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
*   **Implementation:** Libraries like `Geoopt` or `PyManopt` in Python can facilitate Riemannian optimization. Autodifferentiation frameworks (PyTorch, JAX) will be used for gradient computation, including backpropagation through the geometric encoder for the collision term gradient.

### 3.5 Experimental Design

*   **Simulation Environment:** We will use standard robotics simulators like PyBullet or RaiSim, which allow for accurate physics simulation, collision detection (for ground truth generation and validation), and visualization.
*   **Robots:** Experiments will be conducted on:
    *   A planar manipulator (e.g., 3-DOF arm, $Q \subset (S^1)^3$) to allow easy visualization of the $C$-space.
    *   A 7-DOF manipulator (e.g., Franka Emika Panda, $Q \subset \mathbb{R}^7$ with joint limits) operating in 3D cluttered environments.
    *   Optionally, a mobile manipulator ($Q \subset SE(2) \times \mathbb{R}^k$ or $SE(3) \times \mathbb{R}^k$) to test handling of product manifolds involving SE(n) groups.
*   **Datasets:**
    *   **Training:** Generate diverse datasets of environments with varying obstacle complexity (e.g., random shelves, walls, scattered objects). For supervised training of the encoder, sample configurations and label them using a standard collision checker. For end-to-end approaches, define representative start/goal tasks.
    *   **Testing:** Create separate sets of unseen environments and start/goal pairs to evaluate generalization. Include challenging scenarios like narrow passages and highly cluttered scenes.
*   **Baselines:**
    *   **Classical:** RRT* (sampling-based), CHOMP or TrajOpt (optimization-based). Include variants like BIT*.
    *   **Learning (Generic):** A standard feedforward network or CNN trained to predict waypoints or steering commands, without explicit geometric structure.
    *   **Learning (Geometric):** Motion Planning Diffusion [1], potentially adapted; possibly components of RMPflow [4] if applicable for comparison.
    *   **Ablation:** GeoMotion variant without SE(3) equivariance in the encoder; GeoMotion variant using standard Euclidean optimization instead of Riemannian optimization.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Success Rate:** Percentage of successfully found collision-free paths connecting start and goal within a time limit.
    2.  **Planning Time:** Wall-clock time from query submission to path return.
    3.  **Path Length:** Length of the trajectory in workspace (e.g., end-effector path) and/or C-space (using the defined Riemannian metric).
    4.  **Path Smoothness:** Measured by integrating squared derivatives (velocity, acceleration, or jerk) along the path.
    5.  **Path Feasibility/Clearance:** Minimum distance to obstacles along the path, frequency/magnitude of constraint violations (collisions, joint limits) before any post-processing.
    6.  **Generalization Gap:** Difference in performance metrics between training/seen environments and testing/unseen environments.
    7.  **Computational Cost:** Training time, model size.
