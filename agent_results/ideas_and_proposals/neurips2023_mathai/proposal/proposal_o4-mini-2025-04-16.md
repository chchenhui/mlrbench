Title  
Explainable Mathematical Reasoning for Large Language Models via Dynamic Knowledge Graph Integration  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Mathematical reasoning—the process of representing problems, identifying patterns, and deriving logical inferences—is central to scientific discovery, engineering design, financial modeling, and pedagogy. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and PaLM have shown promising performance on many mathematical benchmarks (e.g., U-MATH, MathBench, PutnamBench, Omni-MATH, FrontierMath), but they remain black‐box solvers. Their latent representations are opaque, multi‐step proofs can suffer from hallucinations, and error diagnosis is difficult. This lack of transparency and reliability limits their deployment in high‐stakes domains such as automated proof assistants, educational tutoring systems, and verification pipelines.  

Research Objectives  
We propose a hybrid architecture that augments LLMs with dynamic Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to produce explainable, faithful, and accurate mathematical reasoning. Our system will:  
• Construct a problem‐specific KG on the fly, where nodes denote mathematical concepts, theorems, and intermediate expressions, and edges encode logical or algebraic relationships.  
• Instruct the LLM to emit structured graph‐update operations at each reasoning step, yielding an explicit reasoning trace.  
• Leverage graph‐constrained decoding to ground the model’s outputs in the KG, reducing hallucinations and preserving coherence.  
• Provide both symbolic answers and a human‐readable proof graph visualization.  

Significance  
1. Explainability: By exposing each reasoning step as explicit graph transformations, users can audit and validate the chain of inference.  
2. Robustness: Graph constraints mitigate hallucination and improve multi‐step coherence.  
3. Error Diagnosis: When a proof fails, the faulty edge or node is pinpointed, facilitating targeted correction or tutoring feedback.  
4. Scalability: Our modular pipeline can incorporate existing mathematical KGs (e.g., MathWorld, theorem libraries) and adapt to new domains or educational levels.  

2. Methodology  
2.1 Overview of the Hybrid Architecture  
Our system comprises three modules: (1) KG Constructor & Retriever, (2) LLM‐Controlled Graph Updater, (3) Graph‐Constrained Decoder & Explainer. Figure 1 (omitted) illustrates the data flow.  

2.2 Knowledge Graph Construction and Retrieval  
We assemble a background KG $G_{\text{bg}}=(V_{\text{bg}},E_{\text{bg}})$ from sources such as:  
– MathWorld ontologies (definitions, properties)  
– Formal theorem libraries (Lean, Coq)  
– Curated notion hierarchies (e.g., “Group → AbelianGroup → CyclicGroup”)  

Each node $v\in V_{\text{bg}}$ has attributes $\phi(v)$ (e.g., symbol, informal description, formal statements). Edges $e=(u\to v)\in E_{\text{bg}}$ encode relations such as “implies,” “special case of,” “derivable by.”  

Given a problem $Q$, we perform:  
1. Textual Retrieval: Use SBERT embedding to compute cosine similarities between $Q$ and node descriptions, retrieving top‐$k$ concept nodes $V_0\subset V_{\text{bg}}$.  
2. Subgraph Extraction: Expand $V_0$ by traversing up to $d$ hops in $G_{\text{bg}}$, forming $G_0=(V_0\cup V_{\text{n}}, E_0)$, where $V_{\text{n}}$ are neighboring nodes.  

2.3 Dynamic Reasoning Graph Construction  
We define the dynamic reasoning graph at step $t$ as $G_t=(V_t,E_t)$, initialized by $G_0$. At each step, the LLM proposes a reasoning action $\alpha_t$ that modifies $(V_{t-1},E_{t-1})\to(V_t,E_t)$. Action types include:  
– AddConcept(node): introduce a new theorem or definition.  
– AddExpression(node): introduce an intermediate expression or equation.  
– AddRelation(u,v,\ell): add an edge with label $\ell$ (e.g., “derived_by,” “substituted_in”).  
– MarkGoal(v): label a node as the final answer or proof goal.  

We instruct the LLM via a prompt template:  
“Given the current reasoning graph in JSON, propose the next action to progress toward solving $Q$. Output a JSON object with keys \{‘action_type’,‘node_id’,…\}.”  

2.4 Graph‐Constrained Decoding  
To ensure the LLM’s tokens remain faithful to the KG, we adopt the Graph‐Constrained Reasoning (GCR) idea (Luo et al., 2024):  
– Encode the current $G_{t-1}$ as a trie $T_{t-1}$ over valid tokens (concept names, relation labels, mathematical symbols).  
– During generation, force the model’s next‐token probability $P(w\mid \cdot)$ to zero if $w$ is not in the trie’s current prefix set.  

Formally, if $\mathcal{V}(h)$ are valid continuations given prefix $h$, we re‐normalize:  
$$P_{\text{constrained}}(w\mid h)=\begin{cases} 
P(w\mid h)/Z &\text{if }w\in\mathcal{V}(h),\\
0&\text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}$$  
where $Z=\sum_{w\in\mathcal{V}(h)}P(w\mid h)$.  

2.5 Algorithmic Pipeline  
Input: Problem description $Q$. Output: Answer node $v^*$ and proof graph $G_T$.  
1. $G_0\leftarrow\text{RetrieveSubgraph}(Q)$  
2. For $t=1\ldots T$ until goal reached or timeout:  
   a. $\alpha_t\leftarrow\text{LLM-GraphStep}(Q,G_{t-1})$  
   b. $G_t\leftarrow\text{ApplyAction}(G_{t-1},\alpha_t)$  
   c. If $\alpha_t=\text{MarkGoal}(v)$, break.  
3. Extract $v^*$ and generate human‐readable explanation by traversing all paths from initial nodes to $v^*$.  

Pseudocode:  
```
function Solve(Q):
    G ← RetrieveSubgraph(Q)
    for t in 1..T_max:
        α ← LLM_GraphStep(Q, G)
        G ← UpdateGraph(G, α)
        if α.action_type == "MarkGoal": break
    return G
```  

2.6 Graph Neural Network Embeddings (Optional)  
To allow soft reasoning or ranking of possible actions, we embed $G_{t}$ via a Graph Neural Network (GNN). Let $h_v^{(0)}=\text{Embed}(\phi(v))$. Then for layers $k=0..K-1$:  
$$h_v^{(k+1)} = \sigma\Bigl(W^{(k)} h_v^{(k)} + \sum_{u\in\mathcal{N}(v)} W_r^{(k)} h_u^{(k)} + b^{(k)}\Bigr).$$  
We use the final node embeddings $\{h_v^{(K)}\}$ as context for LLM prompts, supplying summary vectors to bias action selection.
