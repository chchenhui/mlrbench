# Task-Conditioned Functional Alignment for Cross-Architecture Model Merging

## 1. Introduction

### Background

The convergence of neural models in producing similar representations under similar stimuli has sparked interest across neuroscience and artificial intelligence. This phenomenon, observed in both biological and artificial systems, highlights the underlying mechanisms that drive representation learning. While the theoretical aspects of this convergence are intriguing, the practical applications are equally compelling. Effective merging of pre-trained models can save computational resources and enhance model performance, particularly in scenarios involving multi-modal data or diverse architectures.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a "Task-Conditioned Functional Alignment" (TCFA) technique that enables the merging of neural models with different architectures or task distributions. The TCFA approach focuses on aligning activation spaces based on functional similarity conditioned on specific downstream task properties. By understanding and leveraging the invariances that naturally emerge from learning models, we aim to create lightweight "stitching" layers that facilitate efficient model merging.

### Significance

The significance of this research lies in its potential to address several key challenges in model merging:

1. **Architectural Disparities**: TCFA can bridge the gap between models with different architectures by aligning their activation spaces based on functional similarity, rather than directly aligning parameter spaces.
2. **Task Distribution Variability**: By conditioning alignment on specific task properties, TCFA can accommodate models trained on slightly varied task distributions, ensuring that functional similarities are preserved.
3. **Functional Alignment Complexity**: The proposed method employs sophisticated techniques like Optimal Transport or subspace alignment methods to map activation spaces effectively, ensuring that the alignment is both precise and efficient.
4. **Computational Efficiency**: The lightweight "stitching" layers developed through TCFA require far fewer trainable parameters than full fine-tuning or naive parameter averaging, making model merging computationally efficient.
5. **Generalization Assurance**: By ensuring that merged models generalize well across diverse tasks and inputs, TCFA contributes to the development of robust and versatile neural models.

## 2. Methodology

### Research Design

The methodology for developing the TCFA technique involves several key steps:

1. **Model Selection and Preprocessing**:
   - Choose a set of source models with different architectures or task distributions.
   - Preprocess the models by normalizing their parameters and activation spaces to ensure comparability.

2. **Task-Specific Input Variations**:
   - Probe different layers of the source models using task-specific input variations (e.g., different classes, styles, or transformations). This step aims to identify the functional similarities and differences across models under various conditions.

3. **Optimal Transport or Subspace Alignment**:
   - Apply Optimal Transport or subspace alignment methods (like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) variants) to find minimal transformations that align activation manifolds corresponding to the same task condition across models. These transformations will act as the "stitching" layers.

4. **Model Merging**:
   - Integrate the learned transformations into a single cohesive model, enabling efficient merging across diverse architectures tackling related problems.

### Data Collection

The data collection process involves:

- **Model Datasets**: Obtain pre-trained models from various sources, ensuring they cover a range of architectures and task distributions.
- **Task-Specific Data**: Collect diverse datasets for each task condition, including different classes, styles, and transformations to probe the models effectively.

### Algorithmic Steps

The algorithmic steps for TCFA are as follows:

1. **Input Layer**:
   - $X_i$ = Input data for model $i$
   - $Y_i$ = Output data for model $i$

2. **Layer-wise Activation Probing**:
   - For each layer $l$ of model $i$:
     - Generate task-specific input variations $X_{i,l}^k$ for $k$ different task conditions.
     - Compute the activations $A_{i,l}^k = f_l(X_{i,l}^k)$ for each input variation.

3. **Optimal Transport or Subspace Alignment**:
   - For each layer $l$ and task condition $k$:
     - Apply Optimal Transport or CCA to align activation manifolds $A_{i,l}^k$ across models $i$ and $j$.
     - Compute the alignment transformation $T_{i,j,l}^k$.

4. **Stitching Layer Integration**:
   - Integrate the learned transformations $T_{i,j,l}^k$ into a single model, creating a merged model $M$:
     $$ M(X) = \sum_{i,j} T_{i,j,l}^k(f_l(X)) $$

### Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness of the TCFA technique, the following metrics will be used:

1. **Functional Similarity**:
   - Measure the functional similarity between the merged model and the original source models using metrics like cosine similarity or correlation coefficients.

2. **Task Performance**:
   - Evaluate the performance of the merged model on various downstream tasks, comparing it with the original models and baseline methods.

3. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - Assess the computational efficiency of the TCFA technique by measuring the number of trainable parameters and the computational resources required for merging.

4. **Generalization Assurance**:
   - Test the generalization ability of the merged model across diverse tasks and inputs, ensuring that it performs well beyond the task conditions used for alignment.
