# Universal Representation Alignment in Neural Networks

## Motivation
Different neural networks, when trained on similar data, often develop comparable internal representations, yet they remain difficult to integrate due to architectural differences. This redundancy in representation learning wastes computational resources and hinders knowledge transfer between models. Understanding and formalizing this phenomenon would allow us to efficiently merge models, transfer knowledge across architectures, and potentially reduce the environmental impact of training large models by enabling more effective reuse of learned features.

## Main Idea
I propose developing a formal framework for Universal Representation Alignment (URA) that identifies and maps corresponding representational subspaces across different neural architectures. The approach combines three key components: (1) A contrastive alignment objective that encourages models to develop compatible representations by maximizing similarity between matched features while minimizing overlap with unrelated ones; (2) A structural correspondence learning method that identifies functionally equivalent neurons or subspaces across different architectures; and (3) A representation translation mechanism that enables direct weight transfer between aligned representation spaces. This framework would enable seamless model merging, selective feature transplantation between models, and more efficient multi-task learning by allowing different specialized models to share their learned representations through a common aligned space.
