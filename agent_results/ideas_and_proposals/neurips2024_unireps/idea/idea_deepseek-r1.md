**Title:** Cross-Model Representation Alignment via Contrastive Invariant Learning  

**Motivation:** As neural models proliferate, aligning their latent spaces becomes critical for efficient model merging, reuse, and interoperability. Current approaches struggle to harmonize representations across architectures or training regimes, limiting practical applications like collaborative AI systems. This research addresses the gap by developing a method to enforce invariant features, reducing redundant training and enabling modular model composition.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a contrastive learning framework to project representations from diverse models (e.g., CNNs, transformers) into a unified latent space. The key innovation is an alignment module trained with a contrastive loss that minimizes distance between embeddings of semantically similar inputs across models while maximizing separation for dissimilar pairs. To ensure invariance, data augmentations and multi-task objectives are integrated, encouraging robustness to architectural and initialization differences. The methodology will be validated by measuring post-alignment model stitching success rates and transfer learning performance on benchmarks. Expected outcomes include a scalable alignment technique that enables plug-and-play model interoperability, reducing computational costs for deployment. Impact: This work could democratize access to pre-trained models by simplifying their integration, advancing applications in multi-modal AI and federated learning.
