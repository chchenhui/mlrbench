# Task-Conditioned Functional Alignment for Cross-Architecture Neural Model Merging: A Representation Similarity Approach  

## 1. Introduction  
**Background**  
Recent advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) reveal a striking phenomenon: disparate neural systems—whether biological or artificial—develop similar internal representations when exposed to analogous stimuli. In AI, this manifests as functional alignment across neural networks trained on related tasks, even with differing architectures. However, practical challenges in merging models with divergent architectures or task distributions persist, hindering efficient reuse of pre-trained models. Current approaches, such as parameter averaging or naïve fine-tuning, fail to address architectural disparities and task distribution mismatches, resulting in suboptimal performance. This necessitates a principled method to align representations *functionally*—i.e., based on their input-output mappings—rather than structurally.  

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal aims to:  
1. Develop **Task-Conditioned Functional Alignment (TCFA)**, a framework aligning activation spaces of pre-trained models using task-specific input variations.  
2. Validate TCFA’s ability to merge models with distinct architectures (e.g., ResNet vs. ViT, transformer vs. CNN) and task distributions.  
3. Investigate theoretical connections between representation similarity, optimal transport, and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) in multi-model contexts.  
4. Establish lightweight "stitching" mechanisms to enable efficient cross-model reuse.  

**Significance**  
By decoupling alignment from architectural constraints, TCFA could:  
- Reduce computational costs by enabling modular reuse of pre-trained models.  
- Enhance multi-modal systems by aligning representations across vision, language, and sensor modalities.  
- Provide empirical validation of the *Canonical Representation Hypothesis* [2], which posits mutual alignment of weights, representations, and gradients during training.  
- Advance AI alignment science by clarifying how data distributions shape model representations [4].

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Data Collection & Task Generation  
**Datasets**: Use CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, and a multimodal dataset (e.g., LAION-5B for image-text pairs). For task-conditioned probing, generate input variations through:  
- **Style transfer**: Apply AdaIN to images to alter textures while preserving content.  
- **Class permutations**: Re-map labels across models to simulate task distribution shifts.  
- **Input corruptions**: Add noise, rotations, or occlusions to test robustness.  

**Model Selection**: Use pre-trained models with architectural diversity:  
- Vision: ResNet-50, ViT-B/16, ConvNeXt.  
- Language: BERT, GPT-2, T5.  

### 2.2 Task-Conditioned Functional Alignment (TCFA)  
The TCFA framework has three phases:  

#### Phase 1: Layer-Wise Probing with Task Variations  
For each model, select layers \( L = \{l_1, ..., l_k\} \) and probe their activation spaces \( \mathcal{A}_L \) using task-specific input batches \( X_{\text{cond}} \). Compute activation similarity using *structured similarity index* (SSIM) and *centered kernel alignment* (CKA) [2]:  
$$
\text{CKA}(K, L) = \frac{\text{HSIC}(K, L)}{\sqrt{\text{HSIC}(K, K) \text{HSIC}(L, L)}}
$$  
where \( K, L \) are Gram matrices of activations.  

#### Phase 2: Optimal Transport Alignment  
For layers \( l_i \) (source model) and \( m_j \) (target model), optimize a transport plan \( T \) aligning their activation distributions under the same task condition \( c \). The Wasserstein distance is minimized via Sinkhorn iterations:  
$$
\min_T \sum_{x,y} T_{x,y} \cdot C(\mathcal{A}_l(x), \mathcal{A}_m(y)) + \lambda \cdot \text{KL}(T \| \mathbf{1})
$$  
where \( C \) is a cost matrix (e.g., cosine distance) and \( \lambda \) regularizes entropy.  

#### Phase 3: Stitching Layer Training  
Learn a lightweight linear or 1x1 convolutional layer \( W_s \) to map aligned activations:  
$$
\mathcal{A}'_l = W_s \cdot \mathcal{A}_l + b_s
$$  
Minimize the loss \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{stitch}} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim X_{\text{cond}}} \left[ \|f_{\text{target}}(x) - f_{\text{source}}(W_s \cdot \mathcal{A}_l(x))\|^2 \right] \).  

### 2.3 Experimental Design  
**Baselines**: Compare against:  
1. **Parameter averaging**: Naïvely average weights of models with identical architectures.  
2. **Model stitching** [1]: Train a stitching layer without task conditioning.  
3. **Linear mode connectivity**: Interpolate parameters of models fine-tuned from the same initialization.  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
- **Task performance**: Accuracy/F1-score on merged models vs. individual models.  
- **Alignment score**: CKA similarity between aligned layers.  
- **Efficiency**: Training time, parameter count of stitching layers.  
- **Generalization**: Performance on OOD tasks (e.g., corrupted ImageNet-C).  

**Ablation Studies**:  
- Vary task-conditioning intensity (e.g., style transfer strength).  
- Test layer alignment depth (shallow vs. deep layers).  
- Compare Optimal Transport to CCA-based alignment [3].

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Architecture-Agnostic Merging**: Demonstrate merging of ResNet and ViT models with <10% accuracy drop compared to individual models.  
2. **Lightweight Stitching**: Show that TCFA stitches require ≤5% of target model parameters for alignment.  
3. **CRH Validation**: Empirical evidence that layer alignment correlates with gradient noise/regularization balance per the Polynomial Alignment Hypothesis [2].  

**Theoretical Contributions**  
- Formalize the relationship between Optimal Transport costs and task-conditioned functional equivalence.  
- Extend the Canonical Representation Hypothesis to cross-architecture settings.  

**Practical Impact**  
- Enable **modular AI systems**: Reuse vision encoders across robotics, AR, and autonomous driving pipelines.  
- **Federated learning**: Merge models trained on private, non-IID datasets without sharing raw data.  
- **Neuroscience cross-pollination**: Provide computational frameworks to test representational alignment in biological neural systems.  

**Societal Implications**  
By reducing redundant training, TCFA could lower the carbon footprint of AI development. Its alignment properties may also improve model interpretability, a critical factor in high-stakes domains like healthcare.
