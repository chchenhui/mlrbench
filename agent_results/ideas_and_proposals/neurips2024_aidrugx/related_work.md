**Key Challenges:**

1. **Data Integration Complexity**: Combining diverse biological data types (e.g., genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic) poses significant challenges due to differences in data structures, scales, and noise levels. Effective integration methods are essential to harness the full potential of multi-modal data.

2. **Model Interpretability**: As models become more complex, interpreting their predictions becomes increasingly difficult. Ensuring that models provide transparent and explainable outputs is crucial for gaining trust in therapeutic predictions and for regulatory compliance.

3. **Limited Annotated Data**: High-quality, annotated datasets are scarce in the biomedical domain, limiting the training and validation of machine learning models. Developing strategies to leverage unlabeled data and transfer learning approaches is necessary to overcome this limitation.

4. **Generalization Across Cell Types**: Models trained on specific cell types or conditions may not generalize well to others. Ensuring that models can accurately predict therapeutic outcomes across diverse biological contexts is a significant challenge.

5. **Computational Resource Requirements**: Training and deploying large-scale multi-modal models require substantial computational resources, which may be a barrier for many research institutions. Developing more efficient algorithms and leveraging cloud computing resources can help mitigate this issue.
