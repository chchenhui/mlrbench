## Title: Multi-Modal Foundation Models for Predicting Therapeutic Outcomes in Cell and Gene Therapies

### Introduction

The field of cell and gene therapies has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, offering promising solutions for various diseases. However, the complexity of these therapies, involving intricate genetic perturbations and cellular responses, necessitates sophisticated predictive models to ensure their efficacy, safety, and efficient delivery. Current single-modal AI models often fall short in capturing the multi-faceted dynamics of cell and gene therapies, limiting their ability to predict therapeutic outcomes accurately.

The primary objective of this research is to develop a multi-modal foundation model that integrates genetic/molecular perturbation data with multi-modal readouts (transcriptomic, proteomic, and phenotypic data) to predict therapeutic outcomes. This model will leverage a hybrid architecture combining transformer-based encoders for sequence data (DNA/RNA) and graph neural networks for molecular interactions. By employing cross-modal attention mechanisms, the model will align perturbations to downstream biological effects, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to accelerate the development of targeted therapies by reducing experimental validation cycles and prioritizing high-efficacy candidates. This approach addresses key bottlenecks in cell and gene therapy development, such as off-target effects and delivery inefficiency, enabling faster translation of novel modalities to clinical trials.

### Methodology

#### Research Design

The proposed research follows a multi-phase approach:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - **Genetic/Molecular Perturbation Data:** Obtain CRISPR screen datasets and other genetic perturbation data from repositories such as DepMap and GTEx.
   - **Multi-Modal Readouts:** Collect transcriptomic, proteomic, and phenotypic data from relevant studies and databases.
   - **Data Integration:** Implement early, intermediate, and late integration methods to harmonize data from different modalities, ensuring consistency and comparability.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - **Transformer-Based Encoders:** Utilize transformer architectures to encode DNA/RNA sequences, capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information.
   - **Graph Neural Networks:** Employ graph neural networks to represent molecular interactions and cellular pathways, capturing complex relationships between genetic mutations, gene expression profiles, and drug efficacy.
   - **Cross-Modal Attention Mechanisms:** Develop attention mechanisms that align perturbations to downstream biological effects, ensuring that the model can effectively integrate information from different modalities.

3. **Pre-Training:**
   - Train the model on large public datasets containing genetic/molecular perturbation data and multi-modal readouts. This pre-training phase will enable the model to learn generalizable representations of biological data.

4. **Fine-Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune the model using lab-generated perturbation-response pairs. Implement active learning strategies to iteratively select the most informative data points for experimental validation, ensuring efficient use of resources.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, and mean squared error (MSE) for regression tasks.
   - Conduct cross-validation and external validation to assess the model's generalization capabilities across different cell types and conditions.
