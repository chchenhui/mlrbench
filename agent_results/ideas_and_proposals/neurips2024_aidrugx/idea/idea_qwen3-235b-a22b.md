1. **Title:** Multimodal Foundational Models for Therapeutic RNA Design with Reinforcement Learning and Interpretability  

2. **Motivation:**  
Therapeutic RNA design (e.g., for vaccines) requires optimizing sequences to balance translational efficiency, stability, and immune response. Current methods rely on heuristics or limited in vitro data, which are time-consuming and suboptimal. Foundational models (FMs) pre-trained on multimodal biological data (RNA sequences, secondary structures, protein interactions, etc.) could revolutionize this process by enabling generative and predictive capabilities. Integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with interpretable insights would further refine designs using iterative lab feedback, addressing inefficiencies in traditional workflows and accelerating the development of high-efficacy RNA-based therapies.  

3. **Main Idea:**  
This work proposes a multimodal FM trained on diverse biological datasets (e.g., RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, RNA folding energy) to design optimized mRNA sequences. The FM will jointly model primary sequences and 3D structures, with cross-attention mechanisms to integrate heterogeneous inputs. A generative RL framework will iteratively design sequences optimized for translational efficiency, guided by a reward function derived from in vitro experimental feedback on synthesized candidates. A separate interpretability module will leverage attention maps and counterfactual analysis to identify sequence motifs (e.g., UTR regions) critical for stability/translation. The model will be fine-tuned using synthetic datasets with known "interpretable priors" (e.g., stabilized codon pairs) to improve generalization. Expected outcomes include a 2â€“5x increase in translation efficiency compared to baselines and interpretable design rules for UTR elements, benefiting mRNA vaccines and gene therapies while establishing a reusable pipeline for AI-driven drug modality optimization.
