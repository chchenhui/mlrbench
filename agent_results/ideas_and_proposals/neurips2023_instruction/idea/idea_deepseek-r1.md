**Title:** Cross-Modal Instruction Tuning with Contrastive Attention for Visual-Language Alignment  

**Motivation:** As instruction-following models expand into multimodal domains (e.g., image editing, robotics), their ability to align language instructions with visual contexts remains a critical challenge. Misalignment can lead to errors in tasks like ambiguous object manipulation or imprecise image edits, limiting real-world reliability.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a training framework that integrates **contrastive learning** and **cross-modal attention** to improve alignment between visual inputs and textual instructions. The model is jointly trained on paired (text, image, instruction) datasets, using a dual-objective loss: (1) a contrastive loss to pull together embeddings of semantically aligned instruction-image pairs while pushing apart mismatched pairs, and (2) an attention mechanism that dynamically highlights visual regions relevant to the instruction. For example, in robotic command execution, the model would learn to focus on specific objects mentioned in the instruction. Experiments will benchmark performance on tasks like fine-grained image editing and robotic manipulation, measuring accuracy and human-rated instruction adherence. Expected outcomes include reduced hallucination and improved generalization in unseen multimodal scenarios. The impact spans safer assistive technologies, precise creative tools, and more reliable human-robot interaction.
