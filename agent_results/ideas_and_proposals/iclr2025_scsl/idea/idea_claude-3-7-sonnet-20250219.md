# Causal Data Augmentation for Mitigating Shortcut Learning in Deep Neural Networks

## Motivation
Deep neural networks often exploit spurious correlations and shortcuts, leading to poor generalization in real-world scenarios where these correlations break down. This compromises model reliability, especially for underrepresented groups or minority populations. Current approaches typically require explicit annotation of spurious features or group labels, which is not scalable and may miss subtle correlations. We need automated methods that can identify and mitigate shortcut learning without relying on manual annotations of spurious features.

## Main Idea
We propose a causal data augmentation framework that automatically identifies and mitigates shortcut learning through counterfactual generation. First, the system employs an unsupervised clustering approach to detect potential spurious features by analyzing latent representations across correctly and incorrectly classified samples. Then, using a GAN-based architecture with causal constraints, it generates counterfactual examples that systematically vary the detected spurious features while preserving causal features. This creates a balanced training distribution where spurious correlations are neutralized. The framework includes a self-evaluation mechanism that measures the change in model reliance on different features after augmentation. By iteratively applying this process, the model learns to focus on causal features rather than shortcuts, improving generalization without requiring manual annotation of spurious correlations.
