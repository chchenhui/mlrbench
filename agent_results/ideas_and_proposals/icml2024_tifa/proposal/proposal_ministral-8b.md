# Cross-Modal Watermarking for Verifiable AI-Generated Content Provenance

## Introduction

### Background

The advent of Multi-modal Generative Models (MMGMs) like Sora has significantly expanded the capabilities of AI in generating content across various modalities, including text, images, videos, and audio. This versatility, however, introduces new challenges, particularly in verifying the authenticity and origin of AI-generated content. As these models become more sophisticated, ensuring that AI-generated content is traceable and accountable is crucial for combating misinformation, protecting intellectual property, and maintaining trust in AI systems.

Existing watermarking techniques often struggle with cross-modal generation and robustness against common manipulations. Traditional watermarking methods, while effective for single-modal content, fail to provide a unified framework that can be applied across all modalities. Furthermore, the increasing complexity of post-processing techniques (e.g., compression, cropping, format changes) poses significant challenges to the reliability of watermarking schemes.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a robust and unified watermarking framework that can be embedded within MMGMs to ensure verifiable provenance of AI-generated content across different modalities. This framework aims to:

1. **Embed a unique identifier** directly into the latent space representations of the model before content generation.
2. **Ensure cross-modal watermarking** by allowing the watermark to manifest subtly in the generated output of any modality.
3. **Maintain robustness** against common post-processing operations.
4. **Enable efficient watermark extraction** from various media types, even partial or degraded ones.

### Significance

The development of a cross-modal watermarking framework will have significant implications for the trustworthiness and accountability of AI-generated content. By providing a reliable means of tracing content back to its source, this framework can help combat misinformation, protect intellectual property, and ensure transparency in AI systems. Furthermore, it will contribute to the broader goal of building trustworthy Multi-modal Foundation Models (MFMs) and AI Agents by addressing the critical challenge of content provenance.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed research will follow a systematic approach that involves the following key stages:

1. **Literature Review and State-of-the-Art Analysis**
2. **Watermark Embedding Framework Design**
3. **Cross-Modal Watermarking Implementation**
4. **Robustness Testing and Evaluation**
5. **Watermark Extraction and Decoding**
6. **Performance Metrics and Validation**

### Data Collection

The primary data for this research will include:

1. **Multi-modal generative models**: Access to state-of-the-art MMGMs such as Sora, Stable Diffusion, and Latte.
2. **Post-processing datasets**: Collections of images, videos, audio, and text files subjected to various post-processing operations (e.g., compression, cropping, format changes).
3. **Adversarial datasets**: Datasets containing adversarial examples designed to test the robustness of the watermarking scheme against attacks.

### Watermark Embedding Framework Design

The core of the watermarking framework involves embedding a unique identifier into the latent space representations of the MMGM before content generation. This embedding process will be designed to be:

1. **Imperceptible**: The watermark should not significantly alter the quality or characteristics of the generated content.
2. **Resilient**: The watermark should withstand common post-processing operations without significant degradation.
3. **Cross-modal**: The watermark should be detectable across different modalities.

#### Mathematical Formulation

The embedding process can be formulated as follows:

Given a latent space representation \( \mathbf{z} \) and a unique identifier \( \mathbf{w} \), the watermarked latent representation \( \mathbf{z}_{\text{watermarked}} \) can be computed as:

\[ \mathbf{z}_{\text{watermarked}} = \mathbf{z} + \alpha \cdot \mathbf{w} \]

Where \( \alpha \) is a scaling factor that balances the trade-off between imperceptibility and robustness.

### Cross-Modal Watermarking Implementation

To ensure cross-modal watermarking, the framework will include:

1. **Latent Space Embedding**: Embedding the watermark into the latent space representation before content generation.
2. **Content Generation**: Generating content across different modalities (text, image, video, audio) using the watermarked latent space representation.
3. **Watermark Manifestation**: Ensuring that the watermark manifests subtly in the generated output of any modality.

### Robustness Testing and Evaluation

The robustness of the watermarking scheme will be evaluated using:

1. **Post-processing Operations**: Testing the watermark's resilience against common post-processing operations such as compression, cropping, and format changes.
2. **Adversarial Attacks**: Evaluating the watermark's resistance to adversarial attacks aimed at removing or altering the watermark without degrading content quality.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Using metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and watermark extraction accuracy to quantify the watermark's imperceptibility and robustness.

### Watermark Extraction and Decoding

The framework will include efficient watermark extraction and decoding mechanisms capable of:

1. **Extracting the Watermark**: Retrieving the embedded watermark from the generated content across different modalities.
2. **Decoding the Watermark**: Decoding the extracted watermark to retrieve the unique identifier and associated metadata.

### Performance Metrics and Validation

The performance of the watermarking framework will be validated using:

1. **Imperceptibility Metrics**: PSNR and SSIM to measure the quality of the generated content.
2. **Robustness Metrics**: Watermark extraction accuracy and resistance to adversarial attacks.
3. **Scalability Metrics**: Computational efficiency and impact on model performance.
