**Title:**  
*Proactive Cross-Modal Vulnerability Analysis for Novel Modalities in Multi-Modal Foundation Models*

**Motivation:**  
As MFMs integrate emerging modalities (e.g., 3D point clouds, thermal imaging, or depth sensors), their expanded perceptual capabilities introduce unexplored safety risks. For instance, new modalities in robotics or healthcare agents could inherit vulnerabilities from rare edge cases (e.g., adversarial 3D objects, sensor spoofing) or enable privacy leaks (e.g., thermal data revealing personal activities). Current safety evaluations focus on text/image/audio, leaving novel modalities under-scrutinized. Proactively identifying and mitigating risks in these modalities is critical for building trustworthy AI systems that interact with diverse real-world environments.  

**Main Idea:**  
Develop a framework to systematically identify vulnerabilities arising from novel input modalities and their cross-modal interactions. The approach includes:  
1. **Modality-Specific Threat Modeling**: Curate risk taxonomies for understudied modalities (e.g., LiDAR spoofing, bio-signal inversion attacks) and their cascading effects on model reasoning.  
2. **Cross-Modal Attack Simulation**: Design adversarial perturbations or data corruption techniques tailored to disrupt modality fusion layers (e.g., inducing misalignment between thermal and RGB inputs).  
3. **Mitigation via Modality-Aware Safeguards**: Train modality-specific anomaly detectors, embed input sanitization routines, and enforce cross-modal consistency checks during inference.  

Validate the framework using prototype MFMs (e.g., agents with 3D environment sensors) and benchmark against synthetic and real-world attack scenarios. Expected outcomes include a vulnerability catalog, defensive toolkits, and evaluation metrics for emerging modalities, enabling safer integration into sensitive applications like autonomous systems or medical diagnostics.
