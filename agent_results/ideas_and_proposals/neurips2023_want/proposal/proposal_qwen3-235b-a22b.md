# Dynamic Resource-Aware Adaptive Data Preprocessing for Scalable Neural Network Training

## Introduction

### Background  
The training of large-scale neural networks has become a cornerstone of modern AI advancements, driven by applications such as large language models (LLMs), diffusion models, and scientific AI. However, the scalability of these models is often hindered by inefficient resource utilization during critical phases of training. Data preprocessing and loading, while frequently overlooked, represent significant bottlenecks due to static pipeline designs that fail to adapt to dynamic computational environments. These pipelines often result in imbalanced resource allocation (e.g., idle GPUs waiting for CPU-bound preprocessing tasks), leading to prolonged training times and wasted energy. This inefficiency disproportionately impacts resource-constrained teams, limiting equitable access to AI development.  

### Research Objectives  
This work aims to address the following objectives:  
1. **Design a dynamic data preprocessing framework** that adapts to real-time computational resource availability (CPU/GPU utilization, memory bandwidth, and storage I/O).  
2. **Integrate reinforcement learning (RL)** to optimize task scheduling across heterogeneous resources, minimizing hardware idling.  
3. **Develop adaptive data compression techniques** (e.g., learned codecs) and prioritized prefetching strategies to reduce latency.  
4. **Ensure seamless compatibility** with existing frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) to enable widespread adoption.  

### Significance  
By addressing these challenges, this research will:  
- **Democratize access** to large-scale model training for under-resourced teams.  
- **Improve energy efficiency** in AI training, aligning with sustainable computing goals.  
- **Accelerate innovation** in AI for science (e.g., healthcare, climate modeling) by enabling faster experimentation cycles.  
- **Provide open-source benchmarks** and tools for evaluating data pipeline efficiency.  

## Methodology  

### System Overview  
Our framework consists of four core components:  
1. **Real-time Telemetry Module**: Monitors CPU/GPU utilization, memory consumption, and disk throughput.  
2. **RL-Based Scheduler**: Dynamically allocates preprocessing tasks (e.g., augmentation, tokenization) to available resources.  
3. **Adaptive Compression Engine**: Reduces I/O load via learned codecs (e.g., entropy-coded image representations).  
4. **Prioritized Prefetching Queue**: Anticipates batch requirements using model-aware predictions.  

### Adaptive Scheduler via Reinforcement Learning  
#### Markov Decision Process (MDP) Formulation  
We model the scheduling problem as an MDP with:  
- **State Space (S)**: Vector containing current CPU/GPU utilization ($u_{CPU}$, $u_{GPU}$), available memory ($m_{avail}$), and disk bandwidth ($b_{disk}$).  
- **Action Space (A)**: Allocation of preprocessing stages (e.g., assign decoding to GPU, assign augmentation to CPU).  
- **Reward Function (R)**: A hybrid metric combining data loading latency ($L$) and hardware utilization imbalance ($I$):  
  $$R = -\left(\alpha \cdot L + \beta \cdot I\right), \quad \text{where } I = \left|u_{GPU} - u_{CPU}\right|$$  
  Here, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ balance trade-offs between speed and resource harmony.  

#### RL Algorithm Design  
We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for its stability in continuous control tasks. The policy network $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ outputs a probability distribution over actions. The objective function for updating $\theta$ is:  
$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[\min\left(r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)\hat{A}_t\right)\right],$$  
where $r_t(\theta)$ is the importance ratio of new to old policies, $\hat{A}_t$ is the advantage estimate, and $\epsilon$ controls update conservatism.  

### Data Pipeline Optimization  

#### Dynamic Task Allocation  
Preprocessing stages (e.g., decompression, augmentation) are decoupled into atomic operations. At each training iteration, the RL scheduler selects an allocation strategy:  
- **Case 1 (GPU-bound workload)**: Offload decompression to CPUs to prevent GPU starvation.  
- **Case 2 (CPU bottleneck)**: Use GPU-accelerated tokenization or resize operations.  

#### Adaptive Data Compression  
We integrate **learned compression codecs** trained on domain-specific datasets. For images, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to minimize decoding cost:  
$$\mathcal{L}_{VAE} = \mathbb{E}_{z \sim q_\phi(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(x|z)] - \text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) \| p(z)),$$  
where compressed representations balance reconstruction quality against decoding speed.  

#### Prioritized Prefetching  
Batch priorities are determined by:  
$$p_i = \exp\left(-\gamma \cdot \Delta L_i\right),$$  
where $\Delta L_i$ is the gradient magnitude of the $i$-th batch, and $\gamma$ controls prioritization strength. High-priority batches are prefetched first, reducing wasted computation during training.  

### Experimental Design  

#### Datasets  
- **ImageNet-1K** (224x224 RGB images).  
- **CommonCrawl-12M** (text corpus for language models).  
- **NIH ChestX-ray14** (128x128 medical images).  

#### Baselines  
1. PyTorch DataLoader.  
2. TensorFlow DataService.  
3. NVIDIA DALI (GPU-accelerated library).  

#### Evaluation Metrics  
- **Data Loading Latency**: Average time per batch.  
- **Hardware Utilization**: GPU idle time percentage.  
- **End-to-End Training Time**: For 100 epochs on ImageNet.  
- **Model Accuracy**: Top-5 accuracy of ResNet-50.  

#### Ablation Studies  
1. **Scheduler Ablation**: Compare PPO with heuristic policies (round-robin, CPU-only).  
2. **Compression Ablation**: Measure latency vs. image quality (PSNR) trade-offs.  
3. **Prefetching Ablation**: Analyze F1-score of priority-based vs. uniform prefetching.  

### System Architecture  
The framework is implemented as a distributed system with:  
1. **Control Plane**: Runs the RL scheduler and telemetry aggregator.  
2. **Data Plane**: Spawns worker processes on CPU/GPU nodes.  
3. **API Integration**: Wrappers for `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` and `tf.data`.  

## Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Quantitative Results  
1. **30–50% reduction** in data loading latency across datasets.  
2. **GPU utilization > 90%** in heterogeneous environments.  
3. **15–20% faster convergence** for ResNet-50 on ImageNet compared to baseline pipelines.  

### Deliverables  
1. **Open-Source Library**: Modular implementation compatible with PyTorch/TensorFlow.  
2. **Benchmark Suite**: Standardized metrics for evaluating data pipelines.  
3. **Learned Compression Models**: Domain-specific codecs for public release.  

### Long-Term Impact  
1. **Equity in AI Development**: Enables efficient training on low-budget hardware.  
2. **Sustainable AI**: Reduces energy consumption via optimized resource usage (targeting 25% lower kWh per training run).  
3. **Cross-Domain Applicability**: Directly supports scientific AI applications (e.g., climate simulation, genomics) by accelerating data-intensive workflows.  

## Conclusion  
This proposal introduces a novel framework for adaptive data preprocessing that directly tackles the scalability and resource efficiency challenges outlined in the WANT@ICML2024 workshop. By combining RL-driven scheduling, dynamic task allocation, and domain-specific compression, we aim to redefine best practices in neural network training pipelines. The expected outcomes align closely with the workshop's goals of fostering innovation in computational efficiency and enabling impactful real-world applications.
