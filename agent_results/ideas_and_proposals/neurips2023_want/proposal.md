Title  
Dynamic Resource-Aware Adaptive Data Preprocessing for Scalable Neural Network Training  

Introduction  
Background  
Modern deep learning workloads—large‐scale transformer models, diffusion models, and massive vision encoders—demand ever–higher throughput from data pipelines. Whereas model parallelism, mixed precision, and optimized kernels receive much attention, the data preprocessing and I/O stages remain a persistent bottleneck. Static pipelines in PyTorch/TensorFlow process data in fixed order and on fixed devices, ignoring real‐time variations in CPU‐GPU utilization, memory pressure, and storage bandwidth. This mismatch causes GPU idleness, extended wall‐clock training time, and unequal access to efficient training: large industrial clusters can mask these issues, but smaller labs and emerging‐market practitioners often cannot.  

Research Objectives  
1.  Design and implement a Dynamic Resource‐Aware Data Preprocessing System (DRADP) that, at each training batch, allocates CPU and GPU resources optimally for decoding, augmentation, tokenization, and transfer.  
2.  Formulate the scheduling problem as a reinforcement learning (RL) task and train a lightweight scheduler to adapt to changing hardware telemetry.  
3.  Incorporate adaptive compression—leveraging learned codecs—to accelerate decoding under varying storage throughput.  
4.  Develop a prioritized prefetching mechanism that predicts future batch demands and issues I/O requests in advance.  
5.  Integrate DRADP into existing PyTorch/TensorFlow pipelines via a plug‐and‐play library, and evaluate its impact on end‐to‐end training time, resource utilization, and energy consumption.  

Significance  
By decoupling preprocessing from model execution and dynamically balancing workloads, DRADP can reduce data‐loading latency by 30–50%, improve GPU utilization, and reduce energy per batch. This will democratize efficient training across research teams, catalyze faster iteration of large models, and advance applications in science, healthcare, climate modeling, and finance.  

Methodology  
System Overview  
DRADP consists of four modules: (1) Telemetry Collector, (2) RL‐based Scheduler, (3) Adaptive Compression Engine, and (4) Predictive Prefetcher. These modules communicate via a lightweight shared memory bus and control the DataLoader worker processes or GPU compute streams.  

1. Telemetry Collector  
   •   Gathers real‐time CPU utilization $u_{\mathit{cpu}}$, GPU utilization $u_{\mathit{gpu}}$, free DRAM $m_{\mathit{free}}$, and I/O bandwidth $b_{\mathit{io}}$ every $\Delta t$ ms using OS counters (e.g., Linux perf, NVIDIA Management Library).  
   •   Forms a state vector  
   $$  
     s_t = \bigl[u_{\mathit{cpu}}(t),\;u_{\mathit{gpu}}(t),\;m_{\mathit{free}}(t),\;b_{\mathit{io}}(t)\bigr]\,.  
   $$  

2. RL‐based Scheduler  
   Formulation as Markov Decision Process (MDP):  
   •   State $s_t\in\mathbb{R}^4$ as above.  
   •   Action $a_t$ specifies resource allocation ratios for decoding ($\alpha_{\rm dec}$), augmentation ($\alpha_{\rm aug}$), tokenization ($\alpha_{\rm tok}$), and data transfer ($\alpha_{\rm xfer}$), subject to $\sum_i \alpha_i=1$.  
   •   Reward  
   $$  
     r_t = -\bigl(L_{\rm load}(t) + \lambda\,\mathbb{I}_{u_{\rm gpu}<\tau}\bigr)\,,  
   $$  
     where $L_{\rm load}$ is data‐loading latency for the next batch, $\mathbb{I}$ is an indicator penalizing GPU idleness when utilization falls below threshold $\tau$, and $\lambda$ balances the two objectives.  

   •   We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn a policy $\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)$ with parameters $\theta$. The PPO objective is:  
   $$
     \mathcal{L}(\theta)=\mathbb{E}_t\Bigl[\min\bigl(r_t(\theta)\hat A_t,\;\mathrm{clip}\bigl(r_t(\theta),1-\epsilon,1+\epsilon\bigr)\hat A_t\bigr)\Bigr]\,,  
   $$  
   where $r_t(\theta)=\frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\rm old}}(a_t|s_t)}$ and $\hat A_t$ is the advantage estimate via generalized advantage estimation (GAE).  

   •   Scheduler outputs resource assignments at each batch boundary; worker processes adjust thread‐to‐GPU bindings accordingly.  

3. Adaptive Compression Engine  
   •   Maintains a library of lightweight learned codecs indexed by compression ratio $\rho$ and decoding throughput $T_{\rm dec}$.  
   •   For each file or shard, select codec $c$ to minimize expected decode time  
   $$  
     \min_c\;\frac{\mathrm{size}(f)}{T_{\rm dec}(c)} + \gamma\,\mathrm{error}(c)\,,  
   $$  
     subject to $\mathrm{error}(c)\le\epsilon_{\max}$.  
   •   Update codec selection on‐the‐fly based on $b_{\rm io}(t)$ and CPU load.  

4. Predictive Prefetcher  
   •   Trains an LSTM to predict the next $k$ batch indices:  
   $$
     h_{t+1} = \sigma\bigl(W_h [h_t, x_t] + b_h\bigr),\quad \hat y_{t+1} = \mathrm{softmax}(W_y h_{t+1} + b_y)\,,  
   $$  
     where $x_t$ encodes recent batch sizes and processing times.  
   •   Prefetches $P$ upcoming files into RAM or GPU memory according to predicted schedule and current $b_{\rm io}$.
