**Title:** Adaptive Precision Scaling for Energy-Efficient Large Model Training

**Motivation:** Training large neural networks consumes vast amounts of energy, posing environmental and cost challenges. While low-precision training (e.g., FP8, INT8) reduces energy, static precision often compromises model accuracy or requires extensive tuning. Dynamically adapting precision levels during training based on model sensitivity and hardware state could significantly reduce energy without sacrificing performance.

**Main Idea:** We propose a framework for adaptive precision scaling during training. The system monitors gradient statistics, layer sensitivity (estimated via lightweight probing or second-order information), and hardware power draw in real-time. Based on these inputs, a controller (e.g., a rule-based system or a small RL agent) dynamically adjusts the numerical precision (FP32, FP16, FP8, etc.) for different layers or operations (e.g., forward pass, backward pass, weight updates) across iterations. The goal is to minimize energy consumption under a target accuracy constraint. Expected outcomes include significantly reduced training energy compared to static low-precision or full-precision methods, with negligible impact on final model accuracy. This directly addresses energy-efficient training and efficient computation challenges.
