**Title:** Enhancing Transformer Memory with Modern Hopfield Networks for Scalable Sequence Modeling  

**Motivation:** Transformers struggle with long-term dependencies and efficient retrieval of specific memories from large datasets, partly due to limitations in their self-attention mechanisms. Integrating associative memory principles like Hopfield networks, which offer high-capacity, content-addressable memory, could bridge this gap, enabling more robust handling of memory-intensive tasks in NLP and multimodal learning.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a **Hopfield-Augmented Transformer** that replaces standard attention heads with modern Hopfield layers. Leveraging the exponential memory capacity of continuous Hopfield networks (e.g., Ramsauer et al., 2020), keys and values in attention would dynamically store and retrieve consolidated memory patterns via energy-based dynamics. The hybrid architecture would enable iterative memory updates during forward passes, enhancing associative recall without increasing parameter count. Methodology includes: (1) designing a compatible Hopfield-attention layer, (2) developing training protocols to optimize energy and backpropagation losses jointly, and (3) benchmarking on long-context language modeling and few-shot retrieval tasks. Expected outcomes include improved accuracy on memory-bound tasks (e.g., question answering, episodic reasoning) and a theoretical framework unifying attention and associative memory. Impact: Democratizes Hopfield networksâ€™ theoretical benefits for mainstream AI, enabling scalable, memory-augmented models with neuroscience-inspired robustness.
