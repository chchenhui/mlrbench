**Title:** Associative Memory Kernels for Enhanced Long-Context Reasoning in Transformers

**Motivation:** Standard Transformer attention mechanisms face computational challenges and potential information dilution when processing extremely long sequences. Associative Memories (AMs), particularly modern Hopfield Networks, offer efficient pattern retrieval and consolidation, providing a potential alternative for accessing relevant context without exhaustive pairwise comparisons. This research aims to leverage AM properties to improve the long-context reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Main Idea:** We propose replacing the standard dot-product attention in select Transformer layers with an "Associative Memory Kernel" based on modern Hopfield Networks. Input key-value pairs within the context window will be treated as stored patterns (memories) in the Hopfield energy landscape. For a given query token, the AM kernel will perform an efficient retrieval step (e.g., via energy minimization or update dynamics) to identify the most relevant context patterns. This approach is expected to improve computational scaling with sequence length and enhance the model's ability to recall specific details and maintain coherence over longer distances. We will evaluate this architecture on long-document question-answering and summarization benchmarks.
