Title: LoopEnz – Closed-Loop Generative Design and Microfluidic Screening for Rapid Enzyme Optimization

Motivation:  
Traditional in-silico biomolecular design often stalls when confronted with experimental reality, resulting in lengthy trial-and-error cycles. Bridging generative ML with high-throughput screening can dramatically accelerate enzyme engineering, reduce costs, and uncover novel sequence–function relationships.

Main Idea:  
We propose LoopEnz, an end-to-end platform that iteratively couples a diffusion-based protein generator with microfluidic droplet screening and Bayesian model updating. First, a pretrained sequence diffusion model proposes enzyme variants targeting a desired reaction. Second, variants are expressed on microfluidic chips and assayed for catalytic activity via fluorescent or mass‐spec reporters. Third, measured activities feed into a Bayesian surrogate that refines the diffusion prior for the next design round. After just 2–4 cycles, LoopEnz converges on high‐efficiency variants while mapping the local fitness landscape. Expected outcomes include ≥5× improvement in catalytic turnover and a transferable workflow for diverse enzymes. This closed-loop scheme not only slashes development time but also yields interpretable design rules, advancing both AI-driven biomolecular engineering and experimental integration.
