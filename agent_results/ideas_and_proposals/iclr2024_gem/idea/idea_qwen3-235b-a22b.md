1. **Title**: Adaptive Generative-Experimental Loop for Efficient Biomolecular Design  
2. **Motivation**: Generative ML models often fail to translate in silico predictions to real-world biomolecular applications due to static training data and limited experimental feedback. This disconnect delays practical breakthroughs in drug discovery, enzyme engineering, and synthetic biology. Integrating ML with iterative experimental validation could accelerate the design of functional biomolecules while addressing data scarcity and model generalizability issues.  
3. **Main Idea**: Propose an adaptive loop where a generative ML model (e.g., GNN or diffusion model) iteratively designs biomolecules (e.g., proteins or RNA), and high-throughput experiments validate their function (e.g., binding affinity, stability). Experimental outcomes are fed back into the model via active learning, prioritizing uncertain or high-performing candidates for retraining. The framework incorporates uncertainty quantification to balance exploration/exploitation and model interpretability tools (e.g., attention maps) to align predictions with biological mechanisms. Expected outcomes include reduced experimental costs, discovery of novel biomolecules with tailored properties, and a blueprint for ML-experiment integration. This approach directly bridges computational and experimental efforts, enabling rapid cycles of hypothesis generation, testing, and refinement, critical for tackling challenges like antibiotic resistance or sustainable biocatalysts.
