## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **Symmetry-Aware Physics-Informed Scaling of Foundation Models for Accelerated Molecular Dynamics**

**2. Introduction**

*   **Background:** The intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and scientific discovery is rapidly expanding, offering transformative tools to tackle complex problems across various domains (AI for Science Workshop). Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation, a cornerstone technique in chemistry, materials science, and biology for studying the time evolution of molecular systems, stands to benefit significantly from AI advancements. MD simulations allow researchers to understand phenomena like protein folding, drug binding, reaction mechanisms, and material properties at an atomistic level. However, traditional MD methods, particularly those relying on high-fidelity quantum mechanical calculations (e.g., Density Functional Theory - DFT) or even accurate classical force fields, are computationally demanding. Simulating biologically relevant timescales (milliseconds to seconds) or screening vast chemical/material spaces remains a grand challenge, often requiring prohibitive amounts of supercomputing resources.

    Recent breakthroughs in AI, particularly the success of large "foundation models" trained on vast datasets, suggest a potential pathway to accelerate scientific discovery (Brown_et_al_2020_Language_Models_Are_Few_Shot_Learners). Scaling these models—increasing their parameter count and training data volume—has often led to emergent capabilities and improved performance on downstream tasks. Applying this scaling paradigm to scientific domains like MD is appealing (AI for Science Workshop). However, naive scaling of generic AI architectures for MD presents significant hurdles. Firstly, the computational cost can become astronomical, potentially outweighing the benefits. Secondly, standard AI models often lack inductive biases reflecting the fundamental physics governing molecular systems. Physical laws, such as conservation principles and symmetries (translation, rotation, permutation), are crucial for accurate and stable MD simulations. Ignoring these symmetries forces the model to learn them implicitly from data, requiring significantly more parameters and data, thereby hindering efficient scaling (Batzner_et_al_2021, Musaelian_et_al_2022).

    Equivariant neural networks have emerged as a powerful approach to incorporate these physical symmetries directly into the model architecture (Smidt_et_al_2020_Tensor_field_networks, Liao_et_al_2022, Batzner_et_al_2021, Musaelian_et_al_2022, Le_et_al_2022). By ensuring that model outputs transform predictably under coordinate system transformations (e.g., rotations and translations of the molecule), these networks exhibit improved data efficiency, accuracy, and generalization compared to non-equivariant counterparts, particularly in the low-data regime crucial for many scientific applications. Integrating these equivariant principles within scalable foundation model architectures, such as Transformers (Vaswani_et_al_2017_Attention_Is_All_You_Need), holds immense promise (Liao_et_al_2022, Doe_et_al_2023).

*   **Problem Statement:** While equivariant models offer improved data efficiency and physical consistency, and foundation models provide a framework for large-scale pre-training and transfer learning, the optimal strategy for *scaling* these complex, symmetry-aware models for MD remains an open question. How can we intelligently scale model size and data volume to maximize scientific utility (accuracy, interpretability, discovery potential) per unit of computational cost? Simply increasing parameters and data naively may lead to diminishing returns and exorbitant costs (Key Challenges 1 & 2). Furthermore, standard datasets might not adequately cover the vast chemical and conformational space relevant for discovery, necessitating targeted data acquisition strategies (Key Challenge 5).

*   **Proposed Solution:** We propose a novel framework, **Symmetry-Aware Physics-Informed Scalable Molecular Dynamics (SAPIS-MD)**, integrating three key components:
    1.  **Symmetry-Driven Foundation Model Pre-training:** We will develop and pre-train a Transformer-style foundation model incorporating SE(3)-equivariant attention mechanisms to inherently respect translational, rotational, and permutational symmetries of molecular systems.
    2.  **Physics-Informed Adaptive Scaling:** Instead of arbitrary scaling, we will employ adaptive scaling strategies guided by physics-informed scaling laws, monitoring the trade-off between model performance (e.g., validation error on energy/force prediction) and computational cost (e.g., FLOPs) to dynamically adjust model capacity and training data volume.
    3.  **Active Learning for Targeted Refinement:** We will use uncertainty quantification techniques on the pre-trained model to identify regions of chemical or conformational space where the model is uncertain, actively sample high-fidelity data points (e.g., via DFT calculations) in these regions, and iteratively fine-tune the model for improved accuracy and broader applicability.

*   **Research Objectives:**
    1.  Develop and implement an SE(3)/E(3)-equivariant Transformer-based foundation model architecture suitable for learning interatomic potentials from large-scale molecular conformation datasets.
    2.  Investigate and establish physics-informed scaling laws specific to equivariant MD models, relating model size, data volume, computational cost, and predictive accuracy.
    3.  Implement an adaptive scaling strategy that automatically adjusts model complexity and data acquisition based on the observed scaling laws and performance metrics.
    4.  Integrate an active learning loop using uncertainty quantification to intelligently expand the training dataset with high-value, targeted simulations, focusing on underrepresented or high-uncertainty molecular configurations.
    5.  Benchmark the SAPIS-MD framework against state-of-the-art equivariant GNNs and standard non-equivariant foundation models on diverse MD tasks, including potential energy surface prediction, free-energy estimation, and long-timescale simulations.
    6.  Quantify the improvement in computational efficiency (aiming for ≥2x accuracy-per-FLOP compared to baselines) and assess the interpretability of learned representations.

*   **Significance:** This research directly addresses the critical challenge of efficiently scaling AI models for scientific discovery, as highlighted by the AI for Science workshop theme. By embedding physical symmetries and employing intelligent scaling strategies, SAPIS-MD aims to significantly reduce the computational cost associated with high-accuracy MD simulations. This will democratize access to powerful simulation tools, accelerate the discovery cycle in materials science and drug design, and push the Pareto frontier of methodology, interpretability, and scientific discovery (AI for Science Workshop). Furthermore, this work will contribute valuable insights into the principles of building and scaling effective foundation models for scientific applications beyond MD, fostering interdisciplinary knowledge transfer between AI and the physical sciences. It addresses key challenges identified in the literature, including computational efficiency, incorporating symmetries, data efficiency, and interpretability (Key Challenges 1-4).

**3. Methodology**

Our proposed SAPIS-MD framework follows a structured, three-stage approach integrated with rigorous validation.

*   **Stage 1: Pre-training the Equivariant Foundation Model**
    *   **Data Collection and Preparation:** We will leverage large-scale existing datasets of molecular conformations with corresponding energies and forces, such as subsets of OC20 (Open Catalyst 2020), MD17/rMD17 (small organic molecules), QM9, and potentially generate supplementary data using classical force fields or semi-empirical methods for initial broad coverage. Data will consist of atomic species $\{Z_i\}$, positions $\{\vec{r}_i\}$, and target properties like potential energy $E$ and atomic forces $\vec{F}_i = -\nabla_{\vec{r}_i} E$. We aim for an initial pre-training dataset size on the order of $10^7-10^8$ conformations. Data will be standardized and processed into graph representations where nodes represent atoms and edges represent proximity or bonds.
    *   **Model Architecture:** We will adapt the Transformer architecture (Vaswani_et_al_2017) to operate on 3D molecular graphs while respecting E(3) symmetries (translation, rotation, reflection) and permutation symmetry. We will build upon existing equivariant architectures like Equiformer (Liao_et_al_2022) or NequIP/Allegro concepts (Batzner_et_al_2021, Musaelian_et_al_2022).
        *   **Input Embedding:** Atomic species $Z_i$ will be embedded into initial node features $h_i^{(0)}$, which are scalar (Type-0) tensors. Relative position vectors $\vec{r}_{ij} = \vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j$ will be used to compute geometric features like distances $d_{ij}$ (scalar) and directions $\hat{r}_{ij}$ (vector, Type-1 tensor).
        *   **Equivariant Layers:** The core of the model will consist of multiple equivariant blocks stacked sequentially. Each block will update node features $h_i^{(l)}$ using an equivariant attention mechanism. Inspired by Equiformer and Le et al. (2022), the attention mechanism will operate on features composed of multiple irreducible representations (irreps) of SO(3). An attention weight $a_{ij}^{(l)}$ between nodes $i$ and $j$ at layer $l$ will depend not only on feature content but also on their relative spatial arrangement in an equivariant manner. Message passing or feature updates will involve Clebsch-Gordan tensor products ($\otimes$) to combine features of different irrep types while preserving overall equivariance, similar to NequIP:
            $$ h_i^{(l+1)} = \text{Update}^{(l)} \left( h_i^{(l)}, \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \text{Message}^{(l)}(h_i^{(l)}, h_j^{(l)}, \vec{r}_{ij}) \right) $$
            where $\text{Message}^{(l)}$ and $\text{Update}^{(l)}$ are composed of equivariant operations like tensor products, equivariant linear layers, and non-linearities acting on scalar magnitudes. Attention mechanisms will modulate the summation, potentially using dot products of vector features or equivariant query-key interactions (Liao_et_al_2022, Le_et_al_2022). Permutation invariance will be naturally handled by using sum-pooling over neighbor contributions.
        *   **Output Prediction:** The final layer features $h_i^{(L)}$ will be processed by an equivariant output head to predict scalar total energy $E$ (summing atomic contributions) and vector forces $\vec{F}_i$ for each atom.
    *   **Pre-training Objective:** The model will be trained end-to-end to minimize a combined loss function balancing energy and force prediction accuracy:
        $$ \mathcal{L} = \lambda_E \cdot \text{MSE}(E_{pred}, E_{true}) + \lambda_F \cdot \frac{1}{N_{atoms}} \sum_i ||\vec{F}_{i,pred} - \vec{F}_{i,true}||^2 $$
        where $\lambda_E$ and $\lambda_F$ are weighting factors. We will use optimizers like AdamW with appropriate learning rate schedules and weight decay. Training will be performed on large GPU clusters (e.g., leveraging resources like Google Cloud, AWS, or institutional HPC).

*   **Stage 2: Physics-Informed Adaptive Scaling**
    *   **Monitoring Performance vs. Compute:** During and after pre-training, we will systematically monitor the model's performance (e.g., validation loss $\mathcal{L}_{val}$) as a function of computational cost (e.g., cumulative training FLOPs $C$ or wall-clock time). We hypothesize that the validation error follows a power law, potentially modified by physical priors (Johnson & Brown, 2023):
        $$ \mathcal{L}_{val}(C, N, W) \approx A \cdot C^{-\alpha} + \epsilon_{phys} $$
        where $N$ is the number of data points, $W$ is a measure of model width/depth (related to parameters), $A$ and $\alpha$ are scaling coefficients, and $\epsilon_{phys}$ represents a potential error floor related to how well the model captures the underlying physics.
    *   **Adaptive Scaling Strategy:** We will implement a feedback loop to guide scaling:
        1.  Train the model for a specified number of steps or until performance plateaus.
        2.  Evaluate $\mathcal{L}_{val}$ and compute the rate of improvement $d\mathcal{L}_{val}/dC$.
        3.  **Decision Point:** If the rate of improvement falls below a predefined threshold (indicating diminishing returns), trigger a scaling action.
        4.  **Scaling Action:** Based on the scaling laws observed empirically or theoretically derived (Johnson & Brown, 2023), decide whether to:
            *   *Expand Data:* If the model seems data-limited (e.g., performance scales well with initial data size increments), prioritize expanding the pre-training dataset (initially with lower-cost simulations, then potentially higher-fidelity ones).
            *   *Increase Model Capacity:* If the model seems capacity-limited (e.g., performance strongly depends on width/depth), increase the model size (e.g., add more layers, increase hidden dimensions, increase number of irreps) in a way that theoretically aligns with improved representational power for the learned potential energy surface.
            *   *Joint Scaling:* Potentially scale both data and model capacity simultaneously based on optimal resource allocation strategies derived from the observed scaling behavior (Kaplan_et_al_2020_Scaling_Laws_for_Neural_Language_Models).
        5.  Resume training with the scaled resources.
    *   **Implementation:** This involves automated scripts for monitoring training logs, evaluating performance, analyzing scaling trends, and triggering adjustments to model configuration files or data loading pipelines.

*   **Stage 3: Active Learning and Fine-tuning**
    *   **Uncertainty Quantification (UQ):** Once the scaled foundation model achieves satisfactory pre-training performance, we will employ UQ techniques to identify its limitations. Methods may include:
        *   *Deep Ensembles:* Training multiple instances of the model with different initializations and potentially data shuffling, using variance in predictions as an uncertainty measure.
        *   *MC Dropout:* Using dropout layers during inference to approximate Bayesian inference and estimate uncertainty.
        *   *Evidential Deep Learning:* Directly predicting parameters of a distribution over the target variables.
        We will adapt these methods considering the equivariant nature of the model, potentially focusing UQ on scalar energy predictions or force magnitudes (White & Black, 2023).
    *   **Active Sampling Strategy:** We will use the uncertainty estimates to guide the selection of new data points for high-fidelity simulation. An acquisition function (e.g., maximum uncertainty, expected information gain) will rank candidate molecular configurations (e.g., from a cheaper preliminary simulation run using the current model, or from an unexplored region of chemical space). Configurations with the highest uncertainty scores will be prioritized.
    *   **High-Fidelity Data Generation:** Selected configurations will be simulated using accurate (but expensive) methods like DFT calculations to obtain ground-truth energies and forces. This ensures that newly added data provides maximal information content to refine the model in its weakest areas.
    *   **Iterative Fine-tuning:** The foundation model will be fine-tuned on a dataset augmented with the newly generated high-fidelity data. This active learning loop (predict -> quantify uncertainty -> select -> simulate -> fine-tune) will be repeated iteratively to continually improve the model's accuracy, robustness, and domain coverage.

*   **Experimental Design and Validation**
    *   **Datasets:** Benchmark performance on established datasets:
        *   QM9: Small organic molecule properties (energy, forces implicitly).
        *   MD17 / revised MD-17 (rMD17): Short MD trajectories of small molecules.
        *   OC20 IS2RE/IS2RS: Catalyst structure relaxation tasks (energy and forces).
        *   Custom datasets generated for specific tasks like protein dynamics or materials simulations, if applicable.
    *   **Tasks:** Evaluate on core MD capabilities:
        *   Energy and Force Prediction Accuracy: Measured by Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
        *   Long-Timescale Stability: Running NVE simulations using the learned potential and monitoring energy conservation over extended periods.
        *   Conformational Sampling: Comparing trajectories or sampled distributions to reference data (e.g., from long classical MD or enhanced sampling methods).
        *   Free Energy Estimation: Using the learned potential within methods like thermodynamic integration or umbrella sampling and comparing results to known values or higher-level calculations.
    *   **Baselines:** Compare against:
        *   Standard (non-equivariant) Transformer models trained on the same data.
        *   State-of-the-art equivariant GNNs like NequIP (Batzner_et_al_2021), Allegro (Musaelian_et_al_2022), and potentially Equiformer (Liao_et_al_2022), trained under comparable conditions.
        *   Classical force fields (e.g., AMBER, CHARMM) for specific application benchmarks.
    *   **Evaluation Metrics:**
        *   *Accuracy:* RMSE/MAE for energy and forces. Accuracy in predicting specific properties (e.g., free energy differences).
        *   *Computational Efficiency:* Accuracy per FLOP (training + inference), accuracy per wall-clock time. We aim to demonstrate at least a 2x improvement in accuracy-per-FLOP compared to non-equivariant baselines or naive scaling approaches (Green & Blue, 2023, Purple & Orange, 2023).
        *   *Data Efficiency:* Accuracy achieved for a given amount of training data, especially high-fidelity data obtained via active learning.
        *   *Scalability:* How performance metrics change with increasing model size and data according to our adaptive strategy. Parallel scaling performance in large simulations (Musaelian_et_al_2022).
        *   *Interpretability:* Analyze attention weights or feature representations to understand which atomic interactions the model deems important. Compare learned features to known chemical concepts (e.g., bonds, angles, coordination environments). Visualize learned force fields (Red & Yellow, 2023).
