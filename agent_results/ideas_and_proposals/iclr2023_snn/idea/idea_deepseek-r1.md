**Title:** Hardware-Aware Dynamic Sparsity Learning for Sustainable Neural Networks  

**Motivation:** Current sparse training algorithms underutilize hardware capabilities due to rigid sparsity patterns, limiting energy efficiency gains and scalability. While sparsity reduces parameter counts, static pruning methods often mismatch hardware optimizations (e.g., GPU tensor cores), yielding suboptimal performance. Bridging the algorithm-hardware gap is critical to make sparse training practical and sustainable.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a dynamic sparsity framework that optimizes both model efficiency and hardware utilization. The algorithm adapts sparsity patterns during training using real-time hardware feedback (e.g., memory bandwidth, compute latency). Techniques include reinforcement learning to select sparse layer configurations maximizing hardware throughput and model accuracy. Sparsity masks are dynamically adjusted to align with hardware-specific compute units (e.g., NVIDIAâ€™s structured sparsity). Expected outcomes: 1) A hardware-aware training library that reduces energy consumption by 30-50% versus static sparsity methods on GPUs; 2) Theoretical insights into balancing hardware constraints and model performance. This approach could democratize rdware-software co-design.efficient training on existing infrastructure while guiding future ha
