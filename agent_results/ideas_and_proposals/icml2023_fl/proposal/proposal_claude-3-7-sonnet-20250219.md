# FedPEFT+: An Adaptive and Heterogeneity-Aware Parameter-Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning Framework for Foundation Models

## 1. Introduction

Foundation Models (FMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence research and applications, demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. These large-scale models, pre-trained on vast datasets, possess the ability to generalize across multiple tasks through fine-tuning. However, deploying and fine-tuning FMs in practical scenarios faces significant challenges, particularly in federated learning (FL) environments where data privacy is paramount and computational resources are heterogeneous.

Federated Learning has emerged as a promising paradigm that enables collaborative model training while keeping data decentralized. In FL, multiple clients (e.g., mobile devices, organizations) train models locally with their private data, and only model updates are shared with a central server for aggregation. This approach addresses data privacy concerns but introduces unique challenges when applied to FMs, primarily due to their massive size.

### Background and Motivation

Traditional FL approaches typically require clients to download, fine-tune, and upload entire models or their gradients. For FMs with billions of parameters, this approach becomes impractical due to:

1. **Communication Overhead**: Transmitting complete model updates consumes excessive bandwidth.
2. **Computational Constraints**: Most edge devices lack the computational resources to process large FMs.
3. **Memory Limitations**: Edge devices typically cannot accommodate multi-billion parameter models in memory.
4. **Device Heterogeneity**: Varying computational capabilities across clients create significant training inefficiencies.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged as effective solutions for adapting FMs by training only a small subset of parameters. Methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Adapters, Prompt Tuning, and Prefix Tuning have demonstrated that modifying less than 1% of a model's parameters can achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning. While these approaches show promise in centralized settings, their application to federated environments remains underexplored.

Recent works like SLoRA (Babakniya et al., 2023) and FeDeRA (Yan et al., 2024) have begun exploring the integration of PEFT techniques in FL settings. However, these approaches often fail to adequately address the diversity of client resources or the heterogeneity of data distributions in real-world federated environments. Additionally, they do not provide systematic mechanisms for adapting PEFT configurations based on client-specific constraints.

### Research Objectives

This research proposes FedPEFT+, an adaptive and heterogeneity-aware framework for parameter-efficient federated fine-tuning of foundation models. Our approach builds upon existing work in federated PEFT but introduces novel mechanisms to:

1. Dynamically allocate PEFT modules to clients based on their computational resources and data characteristics.
2. Develop specialized aggregation strategies for sparse, low-rank parameter updates.
3. Enable personalization while maintaining global knowledge transfer.
4. Ensure equitable participation across heterogeneous devices.

The primary goal of FedPEFT+ is to make the power of foundation models accessible in federated settings while respecting privacy constraints and accommodating diverse client capabilities.

### Significance

This research addresses critical gaps in deploying foundation models in federated settings:

1. **Democratizing Access to FMs**: By enabling resource-constrained devices to participate in FM fine-tuning, we broaden access to state-of-the-art AI.
2. **Preserving Privacy**: Our approach maintains the privacy benefits of federated learning while leveraging the power of foundation models.
3. **Reducing Environmental Impact**: By minimizing communication and computation, we reduce the carbon footprint of model training.
4. **Enhancing Personalization**: Our framework enables tailoring models to specific clients while preserving global knowledge.

The outcomes of this research will provide a comprehensive framework for deploying foundation models in federated settings, offering practical solutions to the theoretical challenges identified in the literature.

## 2. Methodology

FedPEFT+ introduces a comprehensive framework for adapting foundation models in federated settings through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our methodology addresses the unique challenges of federated learning with large models by introducing adaptive PEFT allocation, specialized aggregation methods, and mechanisms for managing device heterogeneity.

### 2.1 Overall Framework

The FedPEFT+ framework operates in the following phases:

1. **Initialization**: The server initializes the foundation model and prepares a suite of PEFT configurations.
2. **Resource Profiling**: Clients report their computational capabilities and data characteristics.
3. **PEFT Module Allocation**: The server assigns appropriate PEFT modules to each client based on profiling information.
4. **Local Training**: Clients train only their assigned PEFT modules while keeping the base model frozen.
5. **Update Aggregation**: The server collects and aggregates PEFT updates using specialized methods.
6. **Personalization**: The server provides personalized models by combining the global foundation model with client-specific PEFT modules.

The framework is illustrated in Figure 1 (not shown).

### 2.2 Adaptive PEFT Module Allocation

A key innovation in FedPEFT+ is the adaptive allocation of PEFT modules based on client capabilities and data characteristics. We define a utility function that considers:

1. **Device Computational Capacity**: Including available memory, processing power, and expected training time.
2. **Data Characteristics**: Such as data volume, class distribution, and domain specificity.
3. **PEFT Configuration Parameters**: Including module type, rank, and layer placement.

Formally, the utility function $U(c, p)$ for client $c$ and PEFT configuration $p$ is defined as:

$$U(c, p) = \alpha \cdot R(c, p) - \beta \cdot C(c, p) + \gamma \cdot E(c, p)$$

Where:
- $R(c, p)$ represents the estimated performance improvement (accuracy, F1, etc.)
- $C(c, p)$ captures the computational cost (training time, memory usage)
- $E(c, p)$ reflects the expected model expressivity
- $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are weighting parameters

For each client, we select the PEFT configuration that maximizes utility:

$$p_c^* = \arg\max_p U(c, p)$$

We support multiple PEFT techniques within our framework:

1. **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: For clients with moderate computational resources, we use LoRA with adaptive rank selection based on device capacity.

For LoRA, we parameterize weight updates for a pre-trained weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$ as:

$$\Delta W = BA$$

Where $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ and $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$ with rank $r \ll \min(d, k)$.

2. **Adapters**: For more constrained devices, we employ adapters with bottleneck architecture.

For adapters, inserted after attention and feed-forward layers, we define:

$$h' = h + f(hW_{\text{down}})\cdot W_{\text{up}}$$

Where $h$ is the hidden state, $f$ is an activation function, and $W_{\text{down}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times b}$ and $W_{\text{up}} \in \mathbb{R}^{b \times d}$ with bottleneck dimension $b \ll d$.

3. **Prompt Tuning**: For highly constrained devices, we utilize soft prompt tuning with minimal parameters.

For prompt tuning, we prepend trainable embeddings $P \in \mathbb{R}^{l \times d}$ to the input embeddings, where $l$ is the prompt length and $d$ is the embedding dimension.

### 2.3 Local Training Process

Each client receives the frozen foundation model and their assigned PEFT module(s). The local training process is defined as:

1. Initialize PEFT module parameters $\theta_c^0$ (where $c$ represents the client index).
2. For each local epoch $e = 1, 2, ..., E$:
   a. Sample a mini-batch $\mathcal{B}$ from local dataset $\mathcal{D}_c$.
   b. Compute forward pass through the foundation model with PEFT modules.
   c. Calculate loss $\mathcal{L}(\theta_c^{e-1}; \mathcal{B})$.
   d. Update PEFT parameters: $\theta_c^e = \theta_c^{e-1} - \eta \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta_c^{e-1}; \mathcal{B})$, where $\eta$ is the learning rate.

To address catastrophic forgetting and over-fitting to local data, we incorporate a regularization term:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}(\theta_c) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(\theta_c) + \lambda \|\theta_c - \theta_c^0\|^2$$

Where $\lambda$ controls the regularization strength, and $\theta_c^0$ represents the initial PEFT parameters.

### 2.4 Specialized Aggregation Strategies

Traditional federated averaging (FedAvg) may be suboptimal for aggregating PEFT updates due to their sparse, low-rank nature. We propose specialized aggregation methods for different PEFT types:

1. **Weighted LoRA Aggregation**: For LoRA modules, we aggregate the low-rank matrices while preserving their structural properties:

$$A_{\text{global}} = \frac{\sum_{c=1}^{C} n_c A_c}{\sum_{c=1}^{C} n_c}, \quad B_{\text{global}} = \frac{\sum_{c=1}^{C} n_c B_c}{\sum_{c=1}^{C} n_c}$$

Where $n_c$ is the number of samples at client $c$.

2. **Layer-wise Importance Aggregation**: We introduce importance weights for different layers based on client performance:

$$\theta_{\text{global}}^l = \frac{\sum_{c=1}^{C} w_c^l n_c \theta_c^l}{\sum_{c=1}^{C} w_c^l n_c}$$

Where $\theta_c^l$ represents the parameters of layer $l$ from client $c$, and $w_c^l$ is an importance weight derived from validation performance.

3. **Heterogeneous PEFT Fusion**: For scenarios with multiple PEFT types, we develop a knowledge distillation approach:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + (1-\alpha) \mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}(p_{\text{student}} || p_{\text{teacher}})$$

Where $p_{\text{student}}$ and $p_{\text{teacher}}$ represent the output distributions of the student (target PEFT) and teacher (ensemble of other PEFTs) models.

### 2.5 Handling Non-IID Data and System Heterogeneity

To address the challenges of non-IID data distribution and system heterogeneity, FedPEFT+ incorporates:

1. **Clustered Aggregation**: We group clients with similar data distributions using representation similarity:

$$S(c_i, c_j) = \text{cosine}(\text{rep}(c_i), \text{rep}(c_j))$$

Where $\text{rep}(c)$ is a representation vector derived from the client's data distribution.

2. **Asynchronous Participation**: We allow clients to participate asynchronously based on their availability and training progress:

$$\theta_{\text{global}}^t = \theta_{\text{global}}^{t-1} + \eta \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}_t} \frac{n_c}{\sum_{c' \in \mathcal{C}_t} n_{c'}} (\theta_c^t - \theta_c^{\tau_c})$$

Where $\mathcal{C}_t$ is the set of clients participating at round $t$, and $\tau_c$ is the last round in which client $c$ participated.

3. **Adaptive Precision Communication**: We implement adaptive precision for parameter updates:

$$\hat{\theta}_c = \text{Quantize}(\theta_c, b_c)$$

Where $b_c$ represents the bit precision assigned to client $c$ based on bandwidth constraints.
