### Title: Efficient Data Augmentation Techniques for Limited Resource Settings

### Motivation
The lack of labeled data in developing countries poses a significant barrier to the adoption of machine learning solutions. Traditional data augmentation methods, such as synthetic data generation, require substantial computational resources, which are often unavailable in these settings. This research aims to develop efficient and effective data augmentation techniques tailored for low-resource environments, thereby bridging the gap between data scarcity and model performance.

### Main Idea
This research proposes a novel data augmentation framework that leverages lightweight, model-based techniques to generate synthetic data. The methodology involves training a small, efficient model to predict missing labels, which are then used to augment the dataset. This approach minimizes computational requirements and reduces the need for labeled data. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in model performance on limited datasets, with a focus on healthcare and agriculture sectors. The potential impact includes enhanced accessibility to machine learning solutions in developing countries, leading to improved healthcare outcomes and agricultural productivity. Additionally, the research will explore the societal and policy implications of deploying these models in low-resource settings, ensuring that they are fair, explainable, and beneficial to the local communities.
