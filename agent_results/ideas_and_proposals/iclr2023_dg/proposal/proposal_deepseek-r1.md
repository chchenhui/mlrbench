**Research Proposal: Causal Structure-Aware Domain Generalization via Invariant Mechanism Learning**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Modern machine learning models excel in controlled environments but often fail under distribution shifts caused by differences in data collection settings, demographics, or environments. Domain generalization (DG) aims to address this challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. However, current methods—such as domain adversarial training, meta-learning, and invariant risk minimization (IRM)—struggle to consistently outperform naive empirical risk minimization (ERM) baselines. A key limitation is their reliance on spurious correlations that vary across domains, leading to brittle generalizations.  

Causal inference offers a promising direction for DG, as causal mechanisms—relationships between variables that define the data-generating process—are inherently invariant across domains. By disentangling stable causal features from domain-specific biases, models could achieve robustness to distribution shifts. Recent works, such as Contrastive ACE and CIRL, have begun integrating causal principles into representation learning but face challenges in scalability, accurate causal graph inference, and alignment with deep learning architectures.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research proposes a framework that integrates causal discovery with representation learning to extract **domain-invariant causal mechanisms**. The objectives are:  
1. To develop a method that infers causal structures from multi-domain observational data using domain-level metadata.  
2. To enforce invariant representation learning via constraints derived from the inferred causal graph.  
3. To empirically validate the framework on benchmark datasets (DomainBed) and analyze its theoretical guarantees.  

**Significance**  
The proposed framework addresses a critical gap in DG: the inability to isolate stable causal relationships from spurious correlations. By explicitly modeling causal invariance, it could enable reliable deployment of machine learning systems in high-stakes applications like medical imaging (e.g., adapting to diverse scanners) and autonomous driving (e.g., generalizing to unseen weather conditions).

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### **2.1 Research Design**  
The framework consists of three stages:  
1. **Causal Structure Inference**: Learning a causal graph from multi-domain data.  
2. **Invariant Representation Learning**: Aligning model features with causal mechanisms.  
3. **Experimental Validation**: Benchmarking against state-of-the-art DG methods.

#### **2.2 Causal Structure Inference**  

**Data Collection**  
- **Datasets**: Leverage DomainBed benchmarks (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita) with domain-level metadata (e.g., environment labels).  
- **Preprocessing**: Standardize input resolution and normalize features. Use metadata to partition data into distinct domains.  

**Causal Discovery**  
Use constraint-based causal discovery algorithms to infer the causal graph $G = (V, E)$, where nodes $V$ represent features and edges $E$ denote causal relationships. Key steps:  
1. **Conditional Independence Testing**: Identify stable dependencies invariant across domains using multi-domain data. For variables $X_i, X_j$, test $X_i \perp\!\!\!\perp X_j \mid \mathbf{Z}$ across all domains, where $\mathbf{Z}$ is a conditioning set.  
2. **Adapted NOTEARS Algorithm**: Optimize a continuous score function to learn a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):  
$$
\min_{G} \mathcal{L}_{\text{NOTEARS}} = \mathbb{E}_{\text{domains}} \left[ \| \mathbf{X} - \mathbf{X}G \|_F^2 \right] + \lambda \cdot \text{DAGness}(G),  
$$  
where $\text{DAGness}(G)$ penalizes cyclic structures.  
3. **Domain-Aware Modifications**: Incorporate domain labels to model domain-specific confounders as latent variables.

#### **2.3 Invariant Representation Learning**  

**Model Architecture**  
- **Feature Extractor**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone (e.g., ResNet-50).  
- **Causal Regularization Layer**: Projects features into subspace orthogonal to domain-specific factors inferred from $G$.  

**Loss Function**  
The total loss combines ERM with causal invariance penalties:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{train}}} \left[ \ell(f_\theta(x), y) \right]}_{\mathcal{L}_{\text{ERM}}} + \lambda_1 \cdot \underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\text{inv}}}_{\text{Invariance Penalty}} + \lambda_2 \cdot \underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}}_{\text{Causal Alignment}}.  
$$  

- **Invariance Penalty**:  
  Penalize feature variance across domains using contrastive learning:  
  $$ 
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{inv}} = \sum_{i \neq j} \text{MMD}^2\left( \phi(x^{(i)}), \phi(x^{(j)}) \right),  
  $$  
  where $\phi$ is the feature extractor and $\text{MMD}$ is the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between domains $i$ and $j$.  

- **Causal Alignment Penalty**:  
  Enforce sparse alignment with the inferred causal graph $G$:  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}} = \sum_{k=1}^K \| \mathbf{W}_k \odot (1 - A_k) \|_F^2,  
  $$  
  where $\mathbf{W}_k$ are neural network weights and $A_k$ is the adjacency matrix of $G$ at layer $k$.

#### **2.4 Experimental Design**  

**Baselines**  
Compare against:  
1. **ERM**: Vanilla cross-entropy loss.  
2. **IRM**: Invariant Risk Minimization.  
3. **CORAL**: Domain alignment via correlation alignment.  
4. **DANN**: Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks.  

**Evaluation Metrics**  
1. **Classification Accuracy**: Test performance on held-out domains.  
2. **Invariance Score**: Feature distribution similarity across domains (MMD distance).  
3. **Causal Graph Accuracy**: F1 score for edge recovery (on synthetic datasets with known ground-truth graphs).  

**Implementation Details**  
- **Optimization**: AdamW optimizer with learning rate $10^{-4}$, weight decay $10^{-5}$.  
- **Hyperparameters**: $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ tuned via grid search.  
- **Validation**: Leave-one-domain-out cross-validation on DomainBed.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. Improved generalization performance on unseen domains (e.g., 3–5% accuracy gain over IRM on PACS).  
2. Theoretical guarantees linking causal invariance to robustness under specific distribution shifts.  
3. Empirical evidence that causal regularization reduces reliance on spurious features (e.g., via saliency maps).  

**Impact**  
The framework will advance DG by:  
1. Providing a principled approach to integrate causal inference with deep learning.  
2. Enabling reliable models for applications where domains are diverse or unobserved (e.g., healthcare, robotics).  
3. Inspiring new research on causal invariance in transfer learning and out-of-distribution generalization.  

**Societal Implications**  
By reducing failure modes due to distribution shifts, the framework could enhance trust in AI systems deployed in dynamic real-world environments.
