**Cognitive-Informed Generative Models: Aligning Creativity with the Geneplore Framework**  

**2. Motivation**  
Generative AI systems often produce outputs that lack alignment with human creative processes, reducing their utility in collaborative creative tasks. Current models prioritize statistical novelty over psychologically meaningful creativity, limiting their integration into real-world applications. By incorporating formal cognitive models of human creativity, such as the Geneplore (Generate-Explore) framework, we can bridge this gap and enable systems that better simulate human-like divergent thinking. This would enhance applications in education, design, and therapy, where alignment with human cognitive patterns is critical.  

**3. Main Idea**  
We propose a novel generative model architecture that explicitly integrates computational representations of the Geneplore frameworkâ€™s "generation" and "exploration" phases. The model uses a hierarchical reinforcement learning structure: a generator network produces diverse initial ideas, and an evaluator network refines them based on utility, coherence, and surprise metrics derived from psychological studies of human creativity. Behavioral datasets (e.g., creative writing or sketching studies) will train the model via imitation learning. To ensure interpretability, attention mechanisms will highlight transitions between generative and exploratory stages. Expected outcomes include generation of outputs richer in thematic coherence and human-like serendipity, validated through computational creativity benchmarks and human evaluations. This approach could revolutionize creative AI tools by grounding innovation in empirically validated cognitive science principles, fostering more intuitive human-AI collaboration.
