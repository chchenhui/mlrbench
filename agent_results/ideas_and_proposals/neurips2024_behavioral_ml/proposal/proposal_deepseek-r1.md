**Research Proposal: Cognitive Architecture-Guided Training for Human-Like Reasoning in Language Models**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in tasks ranging from text generation to problem-solving. However, their reasoning processes often lack transparency and fail to align with human cognitive patterns, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes domains like healthcare and education. While behavioral sciences offer validated models of human cognition (e.g., ACT-R, CLARION), integrating these insights into LLMs remains underexplored. Recent work, such as the CoALA framework [1] and LLM-ACTR [4], demonstrates the potential of cognitive architectures to structure AI decision-making. However, challenges persist in aligning LLM reasoning with human-like processes without sacrificing performance or scalability.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research aims to:  
1. Develop a hybrid training framework that aligns LLM reasoning pathways with computational cognitive architectures.  
2. Design a constrained decoding mechanism guided by cognitive model predictions to enhance step-by-step reasoning.  
3. Establish evaluation metrics for behavioral congruence and user-perceived naturalness in LLM outputs.  

**Significance**  
By grounding LLMs in cognitive science principles, this work seeks to produce models that generate explanations and decisions mirroring human reasoning. Success would advance interpretable AI, improve human-AI collaboration, and bridge the gap between behavioral sciences and machine learning. Applications include educational tutoring systems, clinical decision support, and transparent AI assistants.

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### **2.1 Framework Design**  
The proposed framework integrates cognitive architectures into LLM training and inference through two components:  

**A. Hybrid Training Objective**  
The training loss combines standard language modeling with alignment to cognitive model "traces" (step-by-step reasoning sequences):  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \lambda_1 \cdotmathcal{L}_{\text{LM}} + \lambda_2 \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{align}}
$$  
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{LM}}$: Cross-entropy loss for next-token prediction.  
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{align}}$: KL divergence between the LLM’s reasoning step distribution $p_{\text{LLM}}(s_t|s_{1:t-1})$ and the cognitive architecture’s predicted distribution $p_{\text{cog}}(s_t|s_{1:t-1})$ at step $t$:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{align}} = \sum_{t=1}^T D_{\text{KL}}\left(p_{\text{cog}}(s_t) \parallel p_{\text{LLM}}(s_t)\right)
$$  
- $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$: Hyperparameters balancing task performance and cognitive alignment.  

**B. Constrained Decoding**  
During inference, token generation is guided by the cognitive architecture’s predicted reasoning steps. At each decoding step $t$:  
1. The cognitive model generates a set of valid next steps $C_t$ based on the current context.  
2. The LLM’s token probabilities $p_{\text{LLM}}(w_t)$ are masked to prioritize tokens in $C_t$:  
$$
p_{\text{masked}}(w_t) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{p_{\text{LLM}}(w_t)}{\sum_{w \in C_t} p_{\text{LLM}}(w)} & \text{if } w_t \in C_t \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$  
3. Tokens are sampled from $p_{\text{masked}}$ using beam search to maintain coherence.  

#### **2.2 Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
- **Datasets**:  
  - **Syllogistic Reasoning**: Curate a dataset of syllogisms with human reasoning traces from psychology experiments [2].  
  - **CommonsenseQA**: Augment with human-written step-by-step explanations.  
  - **Medical Diagnosis**: Collect physician decision logs with annotated reasoning steps.  
- **Cognitive Model Traces**: Use ACT-R or CLARION to generate step-by-step solutions for each input, simulating human problem-solving.  

#### **2.3 Experimental Design**  
**Baselines**:  
1. Standard LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA-3).  
2. LLMs fine-tuned on cognitive traces (e.g., [2]).  
3. Ablated versions of the proposed framework (e.g., without constrained decoding).  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
- **Task Accuracy**: Standard performance on reasoning benchmarks.  
- **Behavioral Congruence**:  
  - **Step Matching Score (SMS)**: BLEU score between LLM and human/cognitive model traces.  
  - **Decision Consistency**: Percentage agreement with human responses in syllogistic tasks.  
- **User Studies**:  
  - **Naturalness**: Likert-scale ratings of explanation plausibility.  
  - **Trustworthiness**: User confidence in LLM decisions after reviewing explanations.  

**Analysis**:  
- Ablation studies to assess contributions of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{align}}$ and constrained decoding.  
- Cross-domain generalization tests (e.g., training on medical data, evaluating on education tasks).

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Behavioral Alignment**: The framework will produce LLMs whose reasoning steps match human traces with ≥15% higher SMS than baselines.  
2. **Maintained Task Performance**: Accuracy on benchmarks like CommonsenseQA will remain within 5% of standard LLMs, demonstrating that cognitive alignment does not degrade utility.  
3. **Enhanced Interpretability**: User studies will show ≥20% improvement in perceived naturalness and trustworthiness compared to vanilla LLMs.  

**Impact**  
- **Scientific**: Advance interdisciplinary research by formalizing methods to integrate behavioral science insights into AI.  
- **Societal**: Enable safer and more transparent AI systems for education (e.g., tutoring bots that explain concepts like humans) and healthcare (e.g., interpretable diagnostic assistants).  
- **Technical**: Provide a blueprint for cognitive architecture integration in future LLMs, addressing scalability and generalization challenges highlighted in [4, 6].

### 4. **Conclusion**  
This proposal outlines a novel approach to bridging machine learning and cognitive science by guiding LLM training with computational architectures like ACT-R. By combining hybrid loss functions with constrained decoding, the framework aims to produce models that are both performant and psychologically aligned. Successful execution will advance the development of trustworthy, human-centered AI systems, fostering collaboration across disciplines and application domains.
