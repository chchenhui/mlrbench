# Cognitive Architecture-Guided Training for Human-Like Reasoning in Language Models

## 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, answering questions, and solving complex problems. However, despite their impressive performance, these models often produce reasoning that lacks transparency, fails to align with human cognitive processes, and exhibits inconsistencies that undermine trust. This disconnect between LLM reasoning and human cognitive processes creates significant challenges in domains requiring explainable, trustworthy AI systems, such as healthcare, education, and high-stakes decision-making environments.

The central problem addressed by this research is the gap between how LLMs reason and how humans reason. Human reasoning follows cognitive processes that have been extensively studied in psychology and cognitive science, resulting in computational cognitive architectures like ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) and CLARION (Connectionist Learning with Adaptive Rule Induction ON-line). These architectures model human memory, attention, learning, and problem-solving with validated psychological processes that can be computationally implemented.

Recent work has begun exploring the integration of cognitive models with LLMs. Sumers et al. (2023) introduced the Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA) framework, which structures language agents with modular memory components. Wu et al. (2024) proposed LLM-ACTR, integrating ACT-R's decision-making processes with LLMs. Binz and Schulz (2023) demonstrated that LLMs could be fine-tuned to represent human behavior in decision-making tasks. However, these approaches have not fully incorporated cognitive architectures' process models into LLM training and inference to produce human-like reasoning pathways.

This research proposes a novel framework for training LLMs that is guided by cognitive architectures to produce human-like reasoning. We aim to address the following research objectives:

1. Develop a hybrid training methodology that incorporates cognitive architecture-based reasoning patterns into LLM training.
2. Design a constrained decoding mechanism that prioritizes cognitive architecture-consistent reasoning during inference.
3. Create evaluation metrics that assess the alignment between LLM reasoning and human cognitive processes.
4. Demonstrate the effectiveness of cognitive architecture-guided LLMs in enhancing human-AI collaboration in educational and decision-support contexts.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to bridge the gap between artificial and human intelligence by grounding LLM reasoning in established cognitive processes. By making LLM reasoning more human-like, transparent, and interpretable, this research will enhance trust in AI systems, improve their utility in collaborative settings, and advance our understanding of both artificial and human intelligence. Moreover, this research contributes to the growing field of behavioral machine learning by providing a concrete methodology for incorporating insights from cognitive science into modern AI systems.

## 2. Methodology

Our methodology consists of four major components: (1) cognitive architecture integration, (2) hybrid training approach, (3) constrained decoding mechanism, and (4) comprehensive evaluation framework.

### 2.1 Cognitive Architecture Integration

We will integrate computational cognitive architectures with LLMs through a novel interface layer that translates cognitive process models into neural network representations. We will focus on two established cognitive architectures:

1. **ACT-R**: A production system architecture that models declarative and procedural memory, attention, and learning mechanisms based on human cognitive processes.
2. **CLARION**: A dual-process architecture that integrates explicit and implicit learning systems, providing models of complex reasoning and knowledge representation.

For each architecture, we will develop a computational representation that maps cognitive processes to neural network operations. This representation will include:

1. **Memory Mapping**: Translating ACT-R's declarative memory and CLARION's explicit knowledge structures into vector representations compatible with LLM embedding spaces.
2. **Process Translation**: Converting ACT-R production rules and CLARION's implicit learning mechanisms into computational steps that can guide LLM attention and processing.
3. **Cognitive Trace Generation**: Creating a system that can generate step-by-step reasoning traces following the cognitive architecture's processing dynamics.

Formally, we define a cognitive trace as a sequence of reasoning steps $T = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\}$, where each step $s_i$ represents a cognitive operation in the architecture. For each reasoning problem, we will use the cognitive architecture to generate a reference trace $T^*$ that will guide the LLM training and inference.

### 2.2 Hybrid Training Approach

We will develop a hybrid training objective that combines traditional language modeling loss with a cognitive alignment loss to guide LLM reasoning. The training will involve three phases:

#### Phase 1: Initial Fine-tuning
We will fine-tune a pre-trained LLM (e.g., LLaMA-3, GPT-4, Gemini) on a dataset of reasoning tasks with annotated intermediate steps. This will create a base model capable of generating step-by-step reasoning.

#### Phase 2: Cognitive Alignment Training
We will train the model with a hybrid loss function that combines language modeling loss with cognitive alignment loss:

$$\mathcal{L}_{hybrid} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{LM} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{cog}$$

where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{LM}$ is the standard language modeling loss: $\mathcal{L}_{LM} = -\sum_{t=1}^{n} \log P(x_t | x_{<t})$
- $\mathcal{L}_{cog}$ is the cognitive alignment loss that penalizes deviations from the reference cognitive trace:

$$\mathcal{L}_{cog} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} d(s_i^{LLM}, s_i^*)$$

where $s_i^{LLM}$ is the $i$-th reasoning step generated by the LLM, $s_i^*$ is the corresponding step in the reference cognitive trace, and $d(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a distance function measuring the similarity between reasoning steps.

For text-based reasoning steps, we will use embedding distance:

$$d(s_i^{LLM}, s_i^*) = 1 - \cos(\text{Embed}(s_i^{LLM}), \text{Embed}(s_i^*))$$

#### Phase 3: Reinforcement Learning with Cognitive Feedback
We will apply reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) adapted to incorporate cognitive architecture feedback:

$$\mathcal{L}_{RL} = -\mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}} [r(x, \pi_\theta) \log \pi_\theta(x)]$$

where $r(x, \pi_\theta)$ is a reward function that combines human preferences with cognitive alignment scores:

$$r(x, \pi_\theta) = \alpha r_{human}(x, \pi_\theta) + (1-\alpha) r_{cog}(x, \pi_\theta)$$

The cognitive reward $r_{cog}$ will measure how well the generated reasoning aligns with the cognitive architecture's predicted reasoning process.

### 2.3 Constrained Decoding Mechanism

We will develop a constrained decoding algorithm that guides LLM generation to follow cognitive architecture-consistent reasoning pathways during inference. This involves:

1. **Process-Guided Attention**: Modifying the attention mechanisms to prioritize tokens that align with the next expected cognitive step.
2. **Cognitive Planning**: Generating a high-level reasoning plan based on the cognitive architecture before detailed text generation.
3. **Dynamic Cognitive Guidance**: Adjusting the generation process based on real-time feedback from the cognitive model.

Formally, during generation at step $t$, we modify the next token probability distribution:

$$P'(x_t | x_{<t}) \propto P(x_t | x_{<t}) \cdot \exp(\beta \cdot s_{cog}(x_t | x_{<t}, C))$$

where $s_{cog}(x_t | x_{<t}, C)$ is a score function that measures how well adding token $x_t$ aligns with the cognitive architecture $C$, and $\beta$ is a temperature parameter controlling the strength of cognitive guidance.

### 2.4 Dataset Creation

We will develop three datasets for training and evaluation:

1. **Cognitive Reasoning Corpus (CRC)**: A dataset of 10,000 reasoning problems across multiple domains (logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, causal reasoning, etc.) annotated with cognitive architecture-generated reasoning traces.

2. **Human Reasoning Benchmark (HRB)**: A collection of 1,000 reasoning problems with both human reasoning traces (collected from human subjects) and cognitive architecture-generated traces, allowing for three-way comparison between LLM outputs, cognitive model predictions, and actual human reasoning.

3. **Applied Reasoning Tasks (ART)**: Domain-specific reasoning tasks in education (50 tutorial explanations), healthcare (100 differential diagnosis cases), and decision support (200 policy analysis scenarios) for evaluating real-world applications.

### 2.5 Experimental Design

We will conduct four sets of experiments to evaluate our approach:

#### Experiment 1: Reasoning Quality and Alignment
Compare our Cognitive Architecture-Guided LLM (CAG-LLM) against baseline LLMs on reasoning quality metrics:
- Reasoning accuracy
- Step-by-step coherence
- Alignment with cognitive architecture predictions
- Alignment with human reasoning patterns

#### Experiment 2: Interpretability and Explainability
Evaluate the interpretability of reasoning through:
- Human evaluations of explanation quality
- Automated metrics for explanation completeness
- Structural similarity between model explanations and cognitive architecture predictions

#### Experiment 3: Domain-Specific Applications
Assess the performance of CAG-LLM in specific domains:
- Educational tutoring effectiveness
- Clinical reasoning support
- Decision-making assistance

#### Experiment 4: Generalization and Transfer
Test the model's ability to generalize to new reasoning domains and transfer cognitive reasoning patterns across tasks.

### 2.6 Evaluation Metrics

We will employ the following evaluation metrics:

1. **Reasoning Accuracy**: Correctness of final answers in reasoning tasks.

2. **Cognitive Alignment Score (CAS)**: Measure of similarity between model reasoning steps and cognitive architecture predictions:
   $$\text{CAS} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{sim}(s_i^{LLM}, s_i^*)$$

3. **Human-Likeness Rating (HLR)**: Human evaluations of reasoning naturalness on a 1-5 scale.

4. **Process Validity Index (PVI)**: Assessment of whether reasoning steps follow valid cognitive processes:
   $$\text{PVI} = \frac{\text{\# valid cognitive operations}}{\text{total operations}}$$

5. **Explanation Quality Score (EQS)**: Combined metric of explanation completeness, coherence, and accuracy.

6. **Application-Specific Metrics**: Domain-specific metrics for educational effectiveness, clinical reasoning accuracy, and decision support quality.
