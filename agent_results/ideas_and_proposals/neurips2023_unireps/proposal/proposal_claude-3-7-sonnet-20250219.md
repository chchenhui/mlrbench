# Neural Geometry Warping: Optimal Transport for Cross-Modal Representation Alignment and Model Integration

## 1. Introduction

### Background
Neural networks, both biological and artificial, demonstrate a remarkable ability to develop similar internal representations when exposed to similar stimuli. This phenomenon has been observed across different modalities, architectures, and even between artificial and biological systems. Recent advances in fields ranging from neuroscience to artificial intelligence have revealed that these representational similarities may reflect fundamental properties of information processing systems, suggesting the existence of universal features and invariances that naturally emerge during learning.

Despite these inherent similarities in representations, effectively integrating or merging models trained on different modalities remains a significant challenge. Current approaches to multimodal learning typically involve training unified architectures from scratch on paired multimodal data, which is computationally expensive and often requires large datasets of aligned cross-modal pairs. Furthermore, this approach fails to leverage the wealth of knowledge already encoded in pre-trained unimodal models.

The challenge of integrating pre-trained models stems primarily from the geometric incompatibility of their latent spaces. While these spaces may encode similar semantic concepts, they do so within fundamentally different coordinate systems, making direct integration ineffective. This incompatibility prevents seamless knowledge transfer across modalities and limits our ability to create modular, reusable AI components—a capability that would significantly advance the field toward more efficient and adaptable artificial intelligence systems.

### Research Objectives
This research proposes a novel framework, Neural Geometry Warping, which leverages optimal transport theory to align and integrate representations from pre-trained models across different modalities. The primary objectives of this research are:

1. To develop a mathematically robust method for aligning the latent spaces of pre-trained models from distinct modalities (e.g., vision and language) without requiring full retraining.

2. To formulate and implement an optimal transport-based approach that preserves semantic relationships while transforming representations from one modality to another.

3. To design and evaluate adaptive fusion mechanisms that effectively integrate aligned representations, enabling cross-modal tasks without extensive joint training.

4. To analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed alignment method, particularly regarding identifiability and invertibility of the transformations.

5. To validate the approach through comprehensive experiments on standard multimodal benchmarks, comparing performance against both individual models and jointly trained multimodal architectures.

### Significance
The development of effective cross-modal representation alignment techniques has far-reaching implications for both theoretical understanding and practical applications in artificial intelligence:

From a theoretical perspective, this research contributes to our understanding of representation spaces in neural networks and the conditions under which they can be meaningfully aligned and integrated. It advances our knowledge of identifiability in neural models and explores the nature of semantic invariances that persist across different modalities and learning processes.

From a practical standpoint, the proposed framework could democratize access to powerful multimodal AI by enabling more efficient creation of multimodal systems from existing pre-trained models. This approach would significantly reduce computational requirements by eliminating the need for joint training from scratch, thereby lowering carbon footprints associated with large-scale AI training. Furthermore, it would facilitate more modular and adaptable AI systems, where components can be seamlessly integrated, replaced, or updated without disrupting the entire system.

By bridging the gap between unimodal expertise and multimodal capabilities, this research paves the way for more sophisticated AI systems capable of synergistic reasoning across modalities—a crucial advancement for applications in robotics, embodied AI, human-computer interaction, and beyond.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

Consider two pre-trained neural networks $f_A: \mathcal{X}_A \rightarrow \mathcal{Z}_A$ and $f_B: \mathcal{X}_B \rightarrow \mathcal{Z}_B$, where $\mathcal{X}_A$ and $\mathcal{X}_B$ represent input spaces for different modalities (e.g., images and text), and $\mathcal{Z}_A$ and $\mathcal{Z}_B$ represent their respective latent representation spaces. Given a dataset of paired samples $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_A^i, x_B^i)\}_{i=1}^N$ where $x_A^i \in \mathcal{X}_A$ and $x_B^i \in \mathcal{X}_B$ are semantically aligned inputs from the two modalities, our goal is to find transformation functions $T_{A\rightarrow B}: \mathcal{Z}_A \rightarrow \mathcal{Z}_B$ and $T_{B\rightarrow A}: \mathcal{Z}_B \rightarrow \mathcal{Z}_A$ that align the representation spaces while preserving semantic relationships.

We then seek to create a merged model $g$ that effectively utilizes these aligned representations to perform cross-modal tasks without full retraining. The merged model should maintain or improve upon the performance of individually trained models on their original tasks while gaining the ability to process and reason across modalities.

### 2.2 Optimal Transport for Representation Alignment

We employ optimal transport (OT) to find the most efficient way to transform representations from one modality to another while preserving semantic structure. Specifically, for each paired sample $(x_A^i, x_B^i)$, we compute their latent representations $z_A^i = f_A(x_A^i)$ and $z_B^i = f_B(x_B^i)$.

To align these representations, we formulate the problem as finding the optimal transport plan between the empirical distributions of $\{z_A^i\}_{i=1}^N$ and $\{z_B^i\}_{i=1}^N$. The optimal transport plan minimizes the expected cost of transforming one distribution into the other, where the cost is defined by a suitable distance metric in the latent space.

Formally, we solve the following discrete optimal transport problem:

$$\min_{\pi \in \Pi(\mu_A, \mu_B)} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N \pi_{ij} c(z_A^i, z_B^j)$$

where:
- $\mu_A = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \delta_{z_A^i}$ and $\mu_B = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \delta_{z_B^i}$ are the empirical distributions
- $\Pi(\mu_A, \mu_B)$ is the set of all joint distributions with marginals $\mu_A$ and $\mu_B$
- $c(z_A^i, z_B^j)$ is the cost function, typically defined as the squared Euclidean distance $\|z_A^i - z_B^j\|^2$
- $\pi_{ij}$ represents the amount of mass transported from $z_A^i$ to $z_B^j$

To make the optimization more tractable, we employ the entropy-regularized optimal transport formulation, also known as Sinkhorn distance:

$$\min_{\pi \in \Pi(\mu_A, \mu_B)} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N \pi_{ij} c(z_A^i, z_B^j) + \epsilon \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N \pi_{ij} \log \pi_{ij}$$

where $\epsilon > 0$ is the regularization parameter that controls the smoothness of the transport plan.

### 2.3 Learning Continuous Transformation Functions

Once we have obtained the optimal transport plan $\pi$, we need to learn continuous transformation functions $T_{A\rightarrow B}$ and $T_{B\rightarrow A}$ that can be applied to any point in the respective latent spaces, not just the observed samples.

We parametrize these transformation functions as neural networks with parameters $\theta_{A\rightarrow B}$ and $\theta_{B\rightarrow A}$, respectively. The training objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the transformed representations and their target representations according to the optimal transport plan:

$$\mathcal{L}_{A\rightarrow B}(\theta_{A\rightarrow B}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left\| T_{A\rightarrow B}(z_A^i; \theta_{A\rightarrow B}) - \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{\pi_{ij}}{\sum_k \pi_{ik}} z_B^j \right\|^2$$

$$\mathcal{L}_{B\rightarrow A}(\theta_{B\rightarrow A}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left\| T_{B\rightarrow A}(z_B^i; \theta_{B\rightarrow A}) - \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{\pi_{ji}}{\sum_k \pi_{ki}} z_A^j \right\|^2$$

Additionally, to ensure that the transformations are invertible and preserve the structure of the original spaces, we add a cycle-consistency constraint:

$$\mathcal{L}_{cycle}(\theta_{A\rightarrow B}, \theta_{B\rightarrow A}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left\| T_{B\rightarrow A}(T_{A\rightarrow B}(z_A^i)) - z_A^i \right\|^2 + \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left\| T_{A\rightarrow B}(T_{B\rightarrow A}(z_B^i)) - z_B^i \right\|^2$$

The final optimization objective combines these losses:

$$\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{A\rightarrow B} + \mathcal{L}_{B\rightarrow A} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{cycle}$$

where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter controlling the importance of cycle-consistency.

### 2.4 Adaptive Cross-Modal Fusion

After aligning the representation spaces, we design an adaptive fusion mechanism to integrate information from both modalities. We propose a cross-attention based fusion module that enables bidirectional information flow between modalities.

Given aligned representations $\hat{z}_A = T_{B\rightarrow A}(z_B)$ and $\hat{z}_B = T_{A\rightarrow B}(z_A)$, along with the original representations $z_A$ and $z_B$, the fusion module computes:

$$h_A = \alpha_A \cdot z_A + (1 - \alpha_A) \cdot \text{CrossAttn}(z_A, \hat{z}_A)$$
$$h_B = \alpha_B \cdot z_B + (1 - \alpha_B) \cdot \text{CrossAttn}(z_B, \hat{z}_B)$$

where $\alpha_A, \alpha_B \in [0, 1]$ are learnable parameters that control the balance between original and cross-modal information, and CrossAttn is a cross-attention mechanism defined as:

$$\text{CrossAttn}(q, k) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{q k^T}{\sqrt{d}}\right) k$$

where $d$ is the dimension of the representations.

The fused representation $h$ is then computed as:

$$h = \text{FFN}([\text{LayerNorm}(h_A); \text{LayerNorm}(h_B)])$$

where FFN is a feed-forward network, LayerNorm is layer normalization, and $[;]$ denotes concatenation.

### 2.5 Identifiability Analysis

To ensure that our transformation functions $T_{A\rightarrow B}$ and $T_{B\rightarrow A}$ preserve the interpretability and functionality of the original models, we perform an identifiability analysis. We verify that the transformations satisfy the following properties:

1. **Injectivity**: Different inputs should map to different outputs, ensuring that no information is lost during transformation.
2. **Surjectivity**: The transformations should cover the entire target space, ensuring that all possible outputs in the target modality can be generated.
3. **Smoothness**: Small changes in the input should result in small changes in the output, ensuring stability of the transformations.

We formalize these requirements by adding regularization terms to our optimization objective:

$$\mathcal{L}_{inj} = \frac{1}{N(N-1)} \sum_{i \neq j} \max(0, \delta - \|T_{A\rightarrow B}(z_A^i) - T_{A\rightarrow B}(z_A^j)\|)$$

$$\mathcal{L}_{smooth} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left\| \nabla_{z_A} T_{A\rightarrow B}(z_A^i) \right\|_F^2$$

where $\delta$ is a margin parameter and $\|\cdot\|_F$ is the Frobenius norm.

### 2.6 Full Algorithm

The complete algorithm for Neural Geometry Warping can be summarized as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of paired samples $(x_A^i, x_B^i)$ from two different modalities.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Compute latent representations $z_A^i = f_A(x_A^i)$ and $z_B^i = f_B(x_B^i)$ using pre-trained models.
3. **Optimal Transport Computation**: Solve the entropy-regularized optimal transport problem to find the transport plan $\pi$ between the empirical distributions of $\{z_A^i\}$ and $\{z_B^i\}$.
4. **Transformation Learning**: Train neural networks $T_{A\rightarrow B}$ and $T_{B\rightarrow A}$ to approximate the transport mappings, with cycle-consistency and identifiability constraints.
5. **Fusion Module Training**: Train the adaptive cross-modal fusion module on a downstream task using the aligned representations.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the merged model on cross-modal tasks and compare with jointly trained baselines.

### 2.7 Experimental Design

We will evaluate our approach on the following tasks and datasets:

1. **Visual Question Answering**: Using the VQA v2.0 dataset, we will evaluate the ability of our merged model to answer questions about images.
2. **Image-Text Retrieval**: Using the COCO and Flickr30k datasets, we will measure the performance of our model in retrieving relevant images given a text query and vice versa.
