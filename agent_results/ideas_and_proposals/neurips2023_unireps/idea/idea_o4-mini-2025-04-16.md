Title: Meta-Procrustes Representational Alignment for Modular Model Merging

Motivation:  
Pretrained neural networks often learn highly similar internal features despite differing initializations, architectures, or modalities. However, their representations remain misaligned, preventing seamless module interchange, multi-model ensembling or cross-modal transfer. A generic alignment framework would unlock practical gains in model reuse, stitching, and efficient fine-tuning across tasks.

Main Idea:  
We propose a Meta-Procrustes learner that trains, across many source models and tasks, a lightweight alignment module for each network layer. For any new pair of pretrained models, this module:  
1. Extracts paired activations on a small calibration dataset.  
2. Solves a regularized Procrustes problem to fit an orthonormal linear map plus a low-capacity nonlinear residual mapping activations from model A into the latent basis of model B.  
3. Stitches the aligned layers to merge modules or transfer heads seamlessly.  

We meta-train alignment modules by sampling diverse tasks and architectures, enforcing that stitched networks match original performance on held-out validation splits. Expected outcomes include zero-shot module swapping, accelerated multi-task adaptation, and improved cross-modal transfer. This framework paves the way for an interoperable “model marketplace” where pretrained components become universally composable.
