**Research Proposal: Dynamic Sparse Retrieval-Augmented Sub-Quadratic Foundation Models for Efficient Long-Context Adaptation**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized AI by delivering state-of-the-art performance across tasks like language modeling, vision, and multimodal reasoning. However, their ability to efficiently adapt to streaming data with long contextual dependencies—such as real-time news analysis or personalized recommendations—remains limited. Current methods, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, face critical trade-offs:  
- **Computational Overhead**: RAG appends retrieved contexts to inputs, inflating the quadratic complexity of transformer attention.  
- **Memory Bottlenecks**: Long-context processing requires unbounded growth of key-value (KV) caches, straining GPU memory.  
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Streaming data demands continuous model updates without costly retraining or catastrophic forgetting.  

Recent works like *AttentionRAG* (Fang et al., 2025) and *PyramidKV* (Cai et al., 2024) address context pruning and KV cache compression but fail to integrate retrieval, sparse computation, and adaptive caching into a unified sub-quadratic framework.  

**Research Objectives**  
This work aims to develop a sub-quadratic architecture that dynamically adapts to streaming long-context data via three innovations:  
1. **Dynamic Sparse Retrieval**: A lightweight retriever trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to fetch only context tokens critical to the current query.  
2. **Sparse Attention Mechanism**: An attention layer processing retrieved tokens with sub-quadratic complexity.  
3. **Rotating Compressive KV Cache**: Fixed-size latent states retaining historical context through low-rank projections.  

**Significance**  
The proposed model will enable FMs to:  
- Process streaming data (e.g., news, sensor inputs) with constant memory and sub-quadratic compute.  
- Maintain high accuracy while reducing latency by 40–60% in long-context tasks.  
- Advance scalable optimization for adaptive FMs, directly addressing the workshop’s focus on efficient inference and continual adaptation.

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### **2.1 Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
**Datasets**:  
- **Streaming News**: Real-time news articles from *NewsStream-24H* (1M articles, updated hourly).  
- **Long-Context QA**: HotpotQA and Natural Questions (NQ) with extended contexts (16k–1M tokens).  
- **Synthetic Data**: Simulated streams with controlled context drift to test adaptability.  

**Preprocessing**:  
1. **Chunking**: Split documents into 4K-token chunks using *LongRAG*-style segmentation (Jiang et al., 2024).  
2. **Relevance Labeling**: Annotate query-chunk pairs via GPT-4-based synthetic labeling for retriever training.  

#### **2.2 Architecture Design**  
The model comprises three modules:  

**1. Dynamic Sparse Retriever**  
- **Input**: Query $q$ and candidate chunks $\{c_1, ..., c_N\}$.  
- **Relevance Scoring**: A lightweight transformer computes scores $s_i = \text{Linear}(\text{FFN}(q \oplus c_i))$.  
- **Top-k Sparsification**: Fetch top-$k$ chunks with the highest $s_i$, where $k$ is dynamically adjusted via RL (see §2.3).  

**2. Sparse Attention Mechanism**  
Replace quadratic self-attention with a **Grouped Cross Attention (GCA)** layer (Hu et al., 2024), modified for retrieved tokens:  
- **Input**: Query tokens $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and top-$k$ retrieved tokens $R \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times d}$.  
- **Attention**: Compute sparse attention scores $A_{ij} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_i R_j^T}{\sqrt{d}}\right)$ for $i \in [1, n], j \in [1, k]$.  
- Complexity reduces from $O(n^2)$ to $O(nk)$, where $k \ll n$.  

**3. Rotating Compressive KV Cache**  
- **Cache Structure**: Fixed-size buffer storing compressed KV states as low-rank matrices.  
- **Compression**: For incoming tokens $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$, project to latent space via $X_{\text{comp}} = W_{\text{proj}}^T X$, where $W_{\text{proj}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ ($r \ll d$).  
- **Rotation Policy**: When the cache exceeds budget $B$, replace the oldest entries using FIFO.  

#### **2.3 Training & Optimization**  
**Reinforcement Learning for Retriever**:  
- **State**: Current query, retrieved chunks, and cache occupancy.  
- **Action**: Selection of $k$ chunks.  
- **Reward**:  
  $$  
  R = \underbrace{\alpha \cdot \text{Accuracy}(q, c_{1:k})}_{\text{Task Reward}} - \underbrace{\beta \cdot k}_{\text{Retrieval Cost}} - \underbrace{\gamma \cdot \text{Cache Usage}}_{\text{Memory Cost}}  
  $$  
  Optimized via PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) to balance accuracy and efficiency.  

**End-to-End Training**:  
- **Loss Function**:  
  $$  
  \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{retrieval}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{cache}}  
  $$  
  where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$ is cross-entropy, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{retrieval}}$ penalizes redundant retrievals, and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{cache}}$ minimizes reconstruction error of compressed KV states.  

#### **2.4 Experimental Design**  
**Baselines**:  
- *LongRAG* (Jiang et al., 2024), *RazorAttention* (Tang et al., 2024), *PyramidKV* (Cai et al., 2024).  

**Metrics**:  
1. **Accuracy**: Exact Match (EM), F1, ROUGE-L.  
2. **Efficiency**: Prefill latency, memory usage, KV cache compression rate.  
3. **Adaptability**: Accuracy drop on streaming data after 24h of updates.  

**Ablation Studies**:  
- Remove dynamic retrieval, sparse attention, or compressive KV cache.  
- Vary $k$ (retrieved chunks) and $r$ (cache rank) to analyze trade-offs.  

**Hardware**: NVIDIA A100 GPUs, simulating edge-device constraints via clock throttling.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**:  
1. **Sub-Quadratic Inference**: Achieve 50–70% lower latency than vanilla RAG on 16k-token contexts.  
2. **KV Cache Compression**: Reduce memory usage by 60% compared to *PyramidKV*, retaining 95% accuracy.  
3. **Streaming Adaptation**: ≤5% accuracy drop after 7 days of news stream updates.  

**Impact**:  
- **Efficient Deployment**: Enables real-time FM adaptation on edge devices for applications like personalized healthcare and financial forecasting.  
- **Scalable Optimization**: Provides a blueprint for co-designing retrieval, attention, and caching in sub-quadratic architectures.  
- **Community Contribution**: Release code, pre-trained retrievers, and a benchmark for long-context streaming adaptation.  

**Future Directions**:  
- Extend to multimodal inputs (video, sensor data).  
- Investigate federated learning for decentralized adaptation.
