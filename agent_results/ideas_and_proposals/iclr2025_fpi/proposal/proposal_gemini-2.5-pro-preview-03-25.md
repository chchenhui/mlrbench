**1. Title:** **Diffusion-Based Inference-Time Alignment for Language Models via Target Density Sampling**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, ensuring their outputs align with human values, preferences, and specific task constraints (e.g., safety, helpfulness, stylistic requirements) remains a critical challenge. The predominant alignment technique, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), involves fine-tuning the base LLM on preference data. While effective, these methods suffer from significant drawbacks: they require substantial computational resources and extensive datasets for fine-tuning, the process can be unstable, and the resulting models are static, unable to adapt to new alignment criteria or user preferences without retraining (Chen et al., 2025; Ouyang et al., 2022). Furthermore, fine-tuning can lead to "alignment tax," potentially degrading the model's general capabilities or causing over-optimization towards the reward signal (Gao et al., 2023).

An alternative paradigm is inference-time alignment, where model outputs are guided towards desired properties *during* the generation process without altering the pre-trained model weights. This approach offers greater flexibility, efficiency, and adaptability. It frames alignment as a sampling problem: given a base LLM distribution $p_{\theta}(x)$ and a target density function $\pi(x)$ incorporating desired attributes (e.g., defined via a reward function $R(x)$ as $\pi(x) \propto p_{\theta}(x)R(x)$), the goal is to efficiently sample from $\pi(x)$. This perspective directly connects LLM alignment to the core challenges in probabilistic inference, particularly sampling from unnormalized distributions, a central theme of the Frontiers in Probabilistic Inference (FPI) workshop.

Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise for generative tasks, including text generation (Li et al., 2022; Uehara et al., 2025). Diffusion models operate by iteratively adding noise to data (forward process) and then learning to reverse this process to generate samples from noise (reverse process). Their iterative nature provides natural control points for incorporating external guidance. Several works have explored inference-time guidance for diffusion models, primarily in the image domain, using techniques like classifier guidance (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021) or energy/reward guidance (Yeh et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2025). Applying these ideas effectively to the discrete, high-dimensional nature of text generation remains an active area of research (Uehara et al., 2025; [Anon, 2023a]; [Anon, 2023b]).

Our research idea builds upon these foundations, proposing a novel diffusion-inspired sampling framework specifically designed for inference-time alignment of LLMs. We hypothesize that by formulating alignment as sampling from a target distribution defined by the base LLM and a reward function, we can leverage a diffusion-based sampler to steer generation towards high-reward, aligned outputs dynamically at inference time. This avoids costly fine-tuning and allows for flexible adaptation to various alignment objectives.

**2.2 Research Objectives**
This research aims to develop and evaluate a novel diffusion-based sampling method for inference-time alignment of LLMs. The specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Diffusion Alignment Sampler (DAS):** Formulate and implement a principled diffusion-based sampling algorithm that operates on the token or embedding space of LLMs. This sampler will iteratively refine generated sequences to align with a target density implicitly defined by a reward function, without modifying the base LLM's parameters. Key aspects include defining appropriate forward/reverse processes for text and integrating reward gradients effectively.
2.  **Incorporate Flexible Reward Guidance:** Design mechanisms within the DAS framework to incorporate guidance from arbitrary (potentially non-differentiable) reward models representing alignment criteria (e.g., safety, helpfulness, style). Explore techniques inspired by classifier guidance and energy-based models adapted for text.
3.  **Optimize Efficiency:** Investigate strategies to ensure the computational feasibility of the DAS method at inference time, such as learned noise schedules, lightweight guidance mechanisms, and potentially adaptive computation during the diffusion process.
4.  **Evaluate Effectiveness and Efficiency:** Empirically evaluate the DAS method on standard alignment benchmarks. Compare its performance (alignment quality, diversity, fluency) and computational overhead (latency, memory usage) against baseline methods, including the base LLM, fine-tuning approaches (e.g., DPO), and other inference-time techniques.
5.  **Analyze Sensitivity and Robustness:** Conduct ablation studies and sensitivity analyses to understand the impact of different components (noise schedule, guidance strength, reward function quality) and assess the method's robustness across various LLMs and alignment tasks.

**2.3 Significance**
This research addresses a critical need for more flexible, efficient, and adaptable methods for LLM alignment. Success in this project would offer several significant contributions:

1.  **Novel Alignment Paradigm:** Provide a viable alternative to computationally expensive fine-tuning methods like RLHF/DPO, enabling dynamic, on-the-fly alignment adaptable to changing requirements or user preferences.
2.  **Advancing Learning-Based Sampling:** Contribute to the FPI workshop's theme by developing and analyzing a sophisticated learning-based sampler operating in the challenging domain of high-dimensional discrete sequences (text) under guidance from an unnormalized target density.
3.  **Bridging Diffusion Models and LLM Control:** Extend the application of diffusion model principles to the controlled generation of text from pre-trained LLMs, offering new insights into controllable text generation.
4.  **Practical Applications:** Enable real-time customization of LLM behavior for diverse applications, such as personalized assistants, content generation with specific safety or stylistic constraints, and domain-specific adaptations without retraining.
5.  **Understanding Alignment Trade-offs:** Provide empirical evidence on the trade-offs between alignment quality, computational cost, sample diversity, and model capability preservation for inference-time methods compared to fine-tuning.

By tackling the limitations of current alignment techniques through a principled, diffusion-based sampling approach, this research holds the potential to significantly impact both the practical deployment of LLMs and the fundamental understanding of sampling methods at the intersection of learning and probabilistic inference.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Theoretical Framework**
Let $p_{\theta}(x)$ be the distribution defined by a pre-trained base LLM with parameters $\theta$ over a sequence of tokens $x = (x_1, ..., x_L)$. Let $R(x): \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^+$ be a reward function assigning a positive score reflecting the desirability of sequence $x$ according to some alignment criteria (e.g., safety, helpfulness). The goal of inference-time alignment is to sample from the target distribution $\pi(x)$ defined as:
$$ \pi(x) = \frac{p_{\theta}(x) R(x)}{Z} $$
where $Z = \sum_{x'} p_{\theta}(x') R(x')$ is the intractable normalization constant. Sampling directly from $\pi(x)$ is challenging due to the unknown normalizer $Z$ and the high dimensionality of the sequence space $\mathcal{X}$.

We propose to address this using a diffusion-based approach. Diffusion models typically define a forward noising process that gradually transforms data $x_0$ into noise $x_T$, and a learned reverse process that denoises $x_T$ back to $x_0$. For text, this process can be defined in the discrete token space or, more commonly, in a continuous embedding space. We will focus on the latter for flexibility.

Let $e = \text{Embed}(x)$ be the sequence of embeddings corresponding to tokens $x$. The forward process can be defined as a sequence of distributions $q(e_t | e_{t-1})$ for $t=1, ..., T$, typically adding Gaussian noise:
$$ q(e_t | e_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(e_t; \sqrt{\alpha_t} e_{t-1}, (1-\alpha_t) \mathbf{I}) $$
where $\{\alpha_t\}_{t=1}^T$ defines the noise schedule. The reverse process aims to approximate $q(e_{t-1} | e_t)$ using a learned model $p_{\phi}(e_{t-1} | e_t)$, often parameterized using techniques related to score matching, predicting the noise added at step $t$ or the original clean data $e_0$.

To sample from the target distribution $\pi(x)$, which corresponds to a target distribution $\pi(e)$ in the embedding space, we can modify the reverse process sampling step. Inspired by classifier guidance (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021) and energy-based guidance (Yeh et al., 2024), the score of the target distribution $\log \pi(e_t)$ can be related to the scores of the base model and the reward:
$$ \nabla_{e_t} \log \pi(e_t) \approx \nabla_{e_t} \log p_{\theta}(e_t) + \nabla_{e_t} \log R(e_t) $$
Here, $p_{\theta}(e_t)$ represents the marginal distribution of the base model at noise level $t$, and $R(e_t)$ is an extension of the reward function to noisy embeddings (potentially by denoising $e_t$ to get an approximate $e_0$ and evaluating $R(\text{Project}(e_0))$). The term $\nabla_{e_t} \log p_{\theta}(e_t)$ is implicitly estimated by the standard denoising model. The guidance term $\nabla_{e_t} \log R(e_t)$ steers the sampling process towards regions favoured by the reward function.

**3.2 Proposed Method: Diffusion Alignment Sampler (DAS)**

Our proposed DAS method implements inference-time alignment using a guided diffusion process operating on LLM embeddings.

1.  **Embedding Space Diffusion:** We will adapt existing continuous diffusion frameworks (e.g., score-based SDEs or Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models - DDPMs) to operate on the embedding sequences generated by the base LLM. We will use a pre-trained base LLM (e.g., Llama-2, Mistral) and its corresponding embedding layer. The forward process adds Gaussian noise to embeddings over $T$ steps.
2.  **Learned Denoising Model:** A separate denoising model $p_{\phi}(e_{t-1} | e_t, c)$, potentially a Transformer network, will be trained to predict the denoised embedding $e_{t-1}$ (or the noise component) given the noisy embedding $e_t$ and optional conditioning information $c$ (e.g., the prompt). This model can be pre-trained on text data to learn the reverse process for the base language distribution $p_{\theta}(x)$ without reward influence, or potentially fine-tuned lightly.
3.  **Reward Gradient Estimation:** The core innovation lies in incorporating the reward $R(x)$. We need to estimate $\nabla_{e_t} \log R(e_t)$.
    *   **Differentiable Rewards:** If $R(x)$ is differentiable w.r.t. model outputs (or embeddings via projection), we can compute the gradient directly, potentially using a predicted $e_0$ from $e_t$: $\hat{e}_0 = \text{PredictDenoised}(e_t)$. Then, $\nabla_{e_t} \log R(\text{Project}(\hat{e}_0))$ can be computed via backpropagation through the prediction and projection steps.
    *   **Non-differentiable Rewards:** For black-box rewards (e.g., scores from external classifiers, human judgments APIs like in Yeh et al., 2024), we can use techniques like score estimation via perturbations or train a separate lightweight model to approximate the reward landscape or its gradient. Another approach is to use Monte Carlo estimates or finite differences around $e_t$.
4.  **Guided Reverse Sampling:** The reverse sampling step $p_{\phi}(e_{t-1} | e_t)$ is modified to incorporate the reward guidance. A common approach is to modify the predicted score (or mean):
    $$ \hat{\mu}_{\text{guided}}(e_t) = \hat{\mu}_{\phi}(e_t) + s \cdot \Sigma_t \nabla_{e_t} \log R(e_t) $$
    where $\hat{\mu}_{\phi}(e_t)$ is the mean predicted by the denoising model $p_{\phi}$, $\Sigma_t$ is the covariance of the reverse step (often related to $1-\alpha_t$), and $s$ is a guidance scale hyperparameter. Alternatively, resampling techniques like Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) as explored by Kim et al. (2025) can be adapted, where particles are weighted by the reward and resampled.
5.  **Learned Noise Schedule & Lightweight Proposal:** As mentioned in the idea, we can explore learning the noise schedule $\{\alpha_t\}$ or the diffusion timestep $T$ to optimize for text generation quality and efficiency. The "lightweight reward-aware proposal" could be interpreted as either the gradient estimation method itself (if efficient) or potentially a small auxiliary network trained to predict reward-gradient directions, reducing reliance on direct computation or complex estimation at each step.
6.  **Projection to Tokens:** After the final denoising step producing $e_0$, the embedding sequence needs to be projected back to the discrete token space $\mathcal{X}$, typically by finding the nearest neighbor tokens in the vocabulary based on embedding similarity (e.g., cosine similarity with the LLM's output embedding matrix).

**3.3 Algorithmic Steps**

The generation process using DAS for a given prompt $P$:

1.  Initialize: Obtain initial embeddings $e_P = \text{Embed}(P)$. Define generation length $L_{gen}$. Start with random noise $e_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$ for the sequence part to be generated. Potentially concatenate $e_P$ and $e_T$ if context is needed during diffusion.
2.  Iterative Denoising (for $t = T, ..., 1$):
    a.  Predict the mean of the reverse step $\hat{\mu}_{\phi}(e_t)$ using the denoising model $p_{\phi}(e_t | c)$.
    b.  Estimate the reward gradient term $\nabla_{e_t} \log R(e_t)$ using one of the methods described in 3.2.3.
    c.  Compute the guided mean $\hat{\mu}_{\text{guided}}(e_t)$ using the guidance scale $s$.
    d.  Sample $e_{t-1}$ from the guided reverse distribution, e.g., $\mathcal{N}(e_{t-1}; \hat{\mu}_{\text{guided}}(e_t), \Sigma_t)$.
3.  Final Projection: Obtain the final denoised embedding sequence $\hat{e}_0 = e_0$. Project $\hat{e}_0$ back to a token sequence $x = \text{Project}(\hat{e}_0)$. Decode the full sequence (prompt + generated tokens).

**3.4 Data Collection**
*   **Base LLMs:** We will utilize publicly available pre-trained LLMs such as Llama-2 (7B, 13B), Mistral (7B), or potentially smaller models for faster experimentation.
*   **Reward Models:** We will leverage existing reward models for standard alignment tasks, such as helpfulness and harmlessness (e.g., from Anthropic's Constitutional AI work or publicly available safety classifiers). We may also train simple reward models based on keyword spotting or classifiers for specific stylistic controls.
*   **Evaluation Datasets:** Standard benchmarks for evaluating LLM alignment will be used, including:

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**
We expect this research to yield the following outcomes:

1.  **A Functional DAS Framework:** A working implementation of the Diffusion Alignment Sampler capable of generating text from base LLMs aligned with specified reward functions at inference time.
2.  **Demonstrated Alignment Capability:** Empirical results showing that DAS can effectively steer LLM generation towards desired attributes (safety, helpfulness, style), achieving alignment scores comparable or potentially better in specific aspects (e.g., flexibility) than fine-tuning methods like DPO, while significantly outperforming the unaligned base model.
3.  **Comparative Performance Analysis:** Quantitative and qualitative comparisons against baselines, highlighting the trade-offs of DAS in terms of alignment strength, sample quality (fluency, diversity), computational cost (latency, memory), and robustness. We anticipate DAS will offer competitive alignment with lower upfront cost than fine-tuning but potentially higher inference latency per token.
4.  **Insights into Diffusion for Text Control:** Deeper understanding of how diffusion processes can be adapted and guided for controlling generation in the discrete, high-dimensional space of language, including the effectiveness of different guidance mechanisms and the role of the noise schedule.
5.  **Analysis of Limitations:** Identification of the limitations of the proposed approach, such as sensitivity to hyperparameters (guidance scale $s$, step count $T$), challenges with complex or conflicting reward signals, and potential failure modes (e.g., mode collapse under strong guidance, generation artifacts). This aligns with the "Challenges and Reflections" track of the FPI workshop.

**4.2 Impact**
The successful completion of this research project is expected to have a significant impact:

*   **Scientific Impact:** This work will contribute directly to the intersection of machine learning and probabilistic inference, particularly in the context of the FPI workshop's themes of "Learning meets Sampling" and "Sampling from generative models weighted by target density." It will advance the understanding and application of diffusion models for complex, structured data like text and provide new methods for sampling from unnormalized distributions defined implicitly by LLMs and reward functions. It will also offer insights into the connections between diffusion-based sampling, optimal control, and gradient-based optimization in high dimensions.
*   **Technological Impact:** DAS could offer a paradigm shift in LLM alignment, moving away from static, costly fine-tuning towards dynamic, efficient inference-time control. This would enable developers to easily customize LLM behavior for specific downstream applications, enforce safety constraints more readily, and potentially allow end-users to personalize their interactions with AI systems in real-time without requiring access to model weights or large computational resources.
*   **Practical Applications:** Potential applications include building safer chatbots, generating content with specific stylistic requirements (e.g., marketing copy, creative writing), adapting LLMs to specialized domains dynamically, and enabling more nuanced control over AI behavior in human-AI interaction scenarios.
*   **Community Resource:** The codebase and findings could serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in LLM alignment, controllable generation, and diffusion models. Documenting challenges and negative results will also provide valuable lessons for the community.

In summary, this research proposes a principled and potentially highly impactful approach to LLM alignment based on diffusion-based sampling. By addressing the limitations of current methods, it promises to deliver more flexible, efficient, and controllable language models, while simultaneously advancing fundamental research in probabilistic inference and generative modeling.
