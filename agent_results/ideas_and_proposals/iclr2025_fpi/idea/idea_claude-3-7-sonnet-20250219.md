# Learning-Assisted Trajectory Optimization for Molecular Dynamics Sampling

## Motivation
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are crucial for understanding biomolecular processes but are severely limited by sampling efficiency. Current MD simulations struggle to explore complex energy landscapes and cross high energy barriers within feasible computational timeframes. This results in incomplete exploration of conformational spaces and inaccurate thermodynamic estimates. While classical sampling methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo and enhanced sampling techniques exist, they often fail to efficiently navigate high-dimensional molecular spaces.

## Main Idea
We propose a hybrid framework that combines machine learning with physics-based trajectory optimization to accelerate MD sampling. The approach uses neural networks to learn and predict the metastable states and transition paths between them, while maintaining physical constraints through trajectory optimization. The framework consists of: (1) an autoencoder to identify relevant collective variables from raw MD trajectories; (2) a reinforcement learning agent that proposes efficient sampling paths by maximizing an exploration-exploitation reward function; and (3) a differentiable physics engine that enforces energy conservation and physical constraints. This approach enables orders-of-magnitude faster exploration of conformational spaces while preserving thermodynamic accuracy. The method can be applied to protein folding, drug-binding simulations, and materials science, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational molecular sciences while maintaining physical interpretability that pure ML approaches often lack.
