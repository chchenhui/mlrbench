   - **Summary**: The authors propose a stochastic optimization approach named Demon to guide the denoising process of diffusion models at inference time without requiring backpropagation through reward functions or model retraining. This method controls noise distribution during denoising to concentrate density on high-reward regions, effectively aligning diffusion models with user preferences. The approach is validated through experiments using non-differentiable reward sources, such as Visual-Language Model APIs and human judgments.

   - **Authors**: [Author names not provided]
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces a diffusion-inspired sampler that generates text by iteratively denoising sequences while incorporating guidance from a target reward model.

**2. Key Challenges**

1. **Computational Efficiency**: Implementing diffusion-based inference-time alignment methods can introduce significant computational overhead, particularly during the iterative denoising process. Balancing alignment quality with inference speed remains a critical challenge.

2. **Scalability**: Ensuring that diffusion-based alignment techniques scale effectively with increasing model sizes and diverse application domains is essential. Methods must be adaptable to various language models without extensive modifications.

3. **Reward Function Design**: Developing appropriate reward functions that accurately capture desired attributes or constraints is complex. Misaligned or poorly designed rewards can lead to suboptimal or unintended model behaviors.

4. **Stability and Convergence**: Ensuring the stability and convergence of the diffusion process during inference is challenging. Improperly tuned parameters or noise schedules can result in unstable generation or failure to align outputs with target distributions.

5. **Generalization**: Achieving robust generalization across different tasks and datasets is difficult. Diffusion-based alignment methods must be evaluated for their ability to maintain performance across various contexts without overfitting to specific scenarios.
