# InfluenceSpace: Hierarchical Influence–Driven Curation for Multi-Modal Foundation Models

## Introduction

Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized machine learning by enabling the development of models that can be adapted to a wide range of tasks with minimal task-specific training. However, the rapid scaling of multi-modal FMs demands massive, heterogeneous datasets, often rife with redundancy, noise, and bias. Traditional curation heuristics fail to quantify each datum’s true effect on downstream performance, making effective pruning and balancing of multi-modal training sets a critical challenge. This research proposes a two-stage pipeline for hierarchical influence-driven curation, which clusters raw data into semantically coherent groups and computes amortized influence scores per cluster. Clusters with negligible or harmful influence are pruned, while underrepresented but high-influence clusters are up-weighted to improve fairness and performance. This method aims to lower resource costs, accelerate convergence, and improve model robustness. The research will evaluate the InfluenceSpace method on vision-language benchmarks, measuring trade-offs between data volume reduction, model accuracy, bias mitigation, and training efficiency. This proposal outlines the methodology, expected outcomes, and impact of the InfluenceSpace approach.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The InfluenceSpace method is designed to address the challenges of data curation and influence estimation in multi-modal foundation models. The pipeline consists of two main stages: clustering and influence-driven curation.

#### Stage 1: Cross-Modal Embedding and Clustering

1. **Cross-Modal Embedding**: Raw multi-modal data is first transformed into cross-modal embeddings using a pre-trained multi-modal model. This step ensures that each data point is represented in a common semantic space, facilitating meaningful clustering.

   $$ \mathbf{x} = f(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{t}) $$

   where \( \mathbf{v} \) and \( \mathbf{t} \) are the visual and textual features, respectively, and \( f \) is the cross-modal embedding function.

2. **Clustering**: The cross-modal embeddings are then clustered into semantically coherent groups using a clustering algorithm. This step groups similar data points together, enabling the computation of influence scores at the cluster level.

   $$ \mathbf{C} = \text{Cluster}(\mathbf{X}) $$

   where \( \mathbf{C} \) is the set of clusters and \( \mathbf{X} \) is the set of cross-modal embeddings.

#### Stage 2: Influence-Driven Curation

1. **Influence Score Computation**: Influence scores for each cluster are computed using a low-rank Hessian approximation and mini-batch gradient samples. This step estimates the impact of each cluster on the model's performance.

   $$ \mathbf{I} = \text{Influence}(\mathbf{C}) $$

   where \( \mathbf{I} \) is the set of influence scores for each cluster.

2. **Pruning and Up-weighting**: Clusters with negligible or harmful influence are pruned, while underrepresented but high-influence clusters are up-weighted. This step ensures that the training corpus is compact, high-utility, and fair.

   $$ \mathbf{D}_{\text{final}} = \text{Prune}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{initial}}, \mathbf{I}) $$

   where \( \mathbf{D}_{\text{final}} \) is the final training corpus and \( \mathbf{D}_{\text{initial}} \) is the initial raw data.

### Experimental Design

The InfluenceSpace method will be evaluated on vision-language benchmarks, such as VisualBERT and LXMERT. The evaluation will measure the following metrics:

1. **Data Volume Reduction**: The percentage of data points removed during the pruning step.
2. **Model Accuracy**: The performance of the model trained on the curated dataset compared to the baseline model trained on the initial raw data.
3. **Bias Mitigation**: The reduction in bias metrics, such as demographic parity and equal opportunity, after applying the InfluenceSpace method.
4. **Training Efficiency**: The time and computational resources required to train the model on the curated dataset compared to the baseline model.

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Data Volume Reduction**: The percentage of data points removed during the pruning step.

   $$ \text{Data Volume Reduction} = \frac{|\mathbf{D}_{\text{initial}}| - |\mathbf{D}_{\text{final}}|}{|\mathbf{D}_{\text{initial}}|} \times 100\% $$

2. **Model Accuracy**: The accuracy of the model trained on the curated dataset compared to the baseline model.

   $$ \text{Model Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Accuracy}_{\text{curated}}}{\text{Accuracy}_{\text{baseline}}} \times 100\% $$

3. **Bias Mitigation**: The reduction in bias metrics after applying the InfluenceSpace method.

   $$ \text{Bias Mitigation} = \text{Bias}_{\text{baseline}} - \text{Bias}_{\text{curated}} $$

4. **Training Efficiency**: The time and computational resources required to train the model on the curated dataset compared to the baseline model.

   $$ \text{Training Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Time}_{\text{baseline}}}{\text{Time}_{\text{curated}}} $$
