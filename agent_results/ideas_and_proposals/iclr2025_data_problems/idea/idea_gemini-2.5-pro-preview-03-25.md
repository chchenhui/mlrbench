**Title:** Fairness-Aware Auditing Framework for Data Curation Pipelines in FMs

**Motivation:** Data curation decisions (e.g., filtering, deduplication, data mixing ratios) significantly impact Foundation Model behavior, yet their specific effects on fairness across different demographic groups are often poorly understood and opaque. This lack of transparency can lead to inadvertent bias amplification, hindering the development of equitable AI systems.

**Main Idea:** We propose developing a modular auditing framework to systematically evaluate the fairness implications of individual stages within FM data curation pipelines. This framework would allow researchers and practitioners to input specific curation operations (like toxicity filtering thresholds or language balancing ratios) and dataset samples. It would then output quantitative metrics assessing the differential impact of these operations on various subgroups (defined by attributes like gender, race, dialect) regarding data representation and potential downstream task performance proxies (e.g., perplexity differences, classification accuracy on group-specific probes). The expected outcome is a tool enabling more informed, fairness-aware data curation decisions, promoting transparency and facilitating the mitigation of biases originating from data preprocessing steps.
