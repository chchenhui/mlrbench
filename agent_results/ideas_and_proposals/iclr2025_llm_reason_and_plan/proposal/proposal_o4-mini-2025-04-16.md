Title  
Adaptive Inference Planner: Dynamic Computation for Efficient LLM Planning  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and OpenAI’s o1 have demonstrated remarkable performance on chains-of-thought problems, multi‐step question answering, and embodied planning tasks. However, these successes often rely on a fixed allocation of computational resources—e.g., a predetermined number of decoding steps or a constant beam width—regardless of the varying complexity of sub‐tasks. As reasoning chains deepen, simple steps are over‐computed and complex steps are under‐attended, leading to inefficiency or suboptimal solutions.  

Recent work in adaptive computation (Sun et al., 2023), meta‐reasoning (Xu et al., 2025), and dynamic planning (Dagan et al., 2023) suggests that LLMs can benefit from a meta‐controller that estimates sub‐task difficulty or uncertainty and allocates resources accordingly. Yet existing methods either focus on multimodal inputs (AdaLLaVA) or post‐hoc plan refinement (AdaPlanner) rather than end‐to‐end dynamic inference.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal introduces the Adaptive Inference Planner (AIP), a meta‐reasoning layer integrated with LLM inference to:  
1. Estimate the difficulty or uncertainty at each planning step.  
2. Dynamically allocate inference resources (e.g., chain‐of‐thought depth, beam size, specialized tool invocation).  
3. Optimize a joint reward that balances task performance and computational cost via reinforcement learning.  

Significance  
AIP will enable LLMs to scale inference to task complexity, reducing latency and cost on simple tasks while preserving or improving solution quality on challenging ones. This has broad implications for real‐time systems, embodied agents, and resource‐constrained deployments.  

2. Methodology  
2.1 Overview  
We formulate planning as a sequential decision process. At each step t, the LLM has a partial plan or reasoning context $h_t$. The meta‐reasoner predicts a difficulty score $d_t$, then chooses a computation action $r_t$ from a discrete budget set $\mathcal{R}$. The LLM executes inference under $r_t$ and emits the next plan step. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent trains the meta‐reasoner to maximize a return that combines task success and cost.  

2.2 Problem Formulation  
State representation:  
$$
s_t = h_t \in \mathbb{R}^n,
$$  
where $h_t$ is the hidden embedding of the current reasoning context.  

Meta‐reasoner difficulty prediction:  
$$
d_t = f_\theta(h_t)\in [0,1],
$$  
where $f_\theta$ is a small neural network trained to predict relative difficulty or predicted error.  

Resource allocation action:  
$$
r_t = \arg\max_{r\in\mathcal{R}} \;\pi_\phi(r\,|\,d_t)\,,
$$  
where $\pi_\phi$ is a lightweight policy network over discrete resource options $\mathcal{R} = \{(k,w,\tau)\}$, with  
• $k$ = number of chain‐of‐thought steps  
• $w$ = beam width  
• $\tau$ = tool or submodel invocation flag  

Inference update: the LLM processes the next step using the configuration $r_t$ and appends the output to $h_{t+1}$.  

Reward function:  
We define a terminal reward $R_{\rm goal}$ for task success (e.g., correct plan, solved puzzle) and a stepwise cost $c(r_t)$ proportional to tokens or latency. The cumulative return is:  
$$
G = R_{\rm goal} - \lambda\,\sum_{t=1}^T c(r_t)\,,
$$  
where $\lambda>0$ trades off performance and efficiency.  

2.3 Algorithmic Steps  
Algorithm 1: Adaptive Inference Planning  
1. Initialize LLM weights and meta‐reasoner parameters $\theta,\phi$.  
2. For each training episode:  
   a. Receive task description and initial context $h_1$.  
   b. For $t=1\ldots T_{\max}$:  
      i. Compute difficulty $d_t = f_\theta(h_t)$.  
      ii. Sample or choose $r_t\sim\pi_\phi(\cdot|d_t)$.  
      iii. Run LLM inference with configuration $r_t$, update $h_{t+1}$.  
      iv. If goal reached or $t=T_{\max}$, break.  
   c. Compute return $G$.  
   d. Update $\phi$ via policy‐gradient (e.g., PPO) to maximize $G$.  
   e. Optionally update $\theta$ with supervised targets from prediction error or from RL gradients.  

2.4 Training Data and Benchmarks  
We will train and evaluate AIP on a suite of planning and reasoning benchmarks:  
• ALFWorld and MiniWoB++ (embodied tasks with environmental feedback).  
• GSM8K and MATH for chain‐of‐thought arithmetic reasoning.  
• Custom long‐horizon decision‐making tasks (e.g., Maze navigation, logistics planning).  

For each domain, we collect or use existing datasets of (initial state, goal) pairs and define environment simulators for feedback.  

2.5 Experimental Design  
Baselines:  
• Fixed inference (fixed chain‐of‐thought length and beam).  
• AdaPlanner (Sun et al., 2023) style looped refinement.  
• AdaLLaVA (Xu et al., 2025) adaptive inference for multimodal input.  

Metrics:  
• Task success rate (accuracy).  
• Average computational cost per instance (e.g., token‐steps, wall‐time).  
• Efficiency ratio: $\frac{\text{success rate}}{\text{average cost}}$.  
• Latency percentile (p95 inference time).  

Ablations:  
• No meta‐reasoner (always choose max resources).  
• Heuristic difficulty (entropy‐based) vs. learned $f_\theta$.  
• Varying $\lambda$ to explore the cost‐performance frontier.  

Statistical Analysis: For each metric, run >30 seeds, report mean±std, and conduct paired t‐tests between AIP and baselines (p<0.05).  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate that AIP will:  
1. Reduce average computational cost by 20–50% on simple to moderate tasks while maintaining or improving success rates.  
2. Improve performance (5–15% higher success) on complex, long‐horizon planning tasks by focusing inference where needed.  
3. Demonstrate generalization across diverse domains (embodied, arithmetic, logistics) without retraining the meta‐reasoner from scratch.  

Impact  
• Scalability: Enables LLMs to operate under strict latency or compute budgets (edge devices, robotics).  
• Adaptivity: Provides a general framework for future extensions—uncertainty‐aware planning, multi‐agent coordination, human‐in‐the‐loop resource trade‐offs.  
• Benchmarking: Introduces new evaluation protocols for adaptive inference, complementing static reasoning benchmarks.  
• Explainability: Difficulty predictions $d_t$ serve as interpretable indicators of where the model “struggles,” aiding debugging and human oversight.  

4. Timeline & Milestones

• Write up results, prepare open‐source release of code and benchmarks.  
• Submit to top venues (e.g., ICLR, NeurIPS, or specialized reasoning workshops).  

By the end of this project, we will have established a robust and general adaptive inference framework, validated across multiple reasoning and planning settings, and have made all code, data, and evaluation scripts publicly available.
