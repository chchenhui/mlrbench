1. Title: Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Inference for Efficient LLM Reasoning

2. Motivation:  
As LLMs tackle long-horizon planning and multi-step reasoning, naive full-model inference incurs high latency and resource costs. Real-world applications—from interactive agents to time-sensitive decision support—demand adaptive compute allocation that preserves reasoning quality while reducing unnecessary computation.

3. Main Idea:  
Introduce a two-tiered inference pipeline where a lightweight “uncertainty estimator” assesses confidence at each chain-of-thought step. For low-uncertainty segments, the model uses a fast, local continuation on a compact LLM proxy; when confidence falls below a threshold, it triggers full-scale inference on the large LLM with expanded beam search. A reinforcement-learning–based gating policy maps uncertainty scores, context embeddings, and reasoning depth to dynamic compute budgets, fine-tuned on multi-step reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, HotpotQA). We expect 2–5× speedups with ≤2% accuracy loss. This framework can extend to multi-modal planning by plugging in modality-specific uncertainty estimators. By allocating compute where it matters most, our method scales complex reasoning and planning tasks for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.
