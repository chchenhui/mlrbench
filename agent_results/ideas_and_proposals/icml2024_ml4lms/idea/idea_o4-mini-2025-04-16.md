Title: MultiScale-MLBench: A Unified Multi‐Modal Benchmark for Translational ML in Life and Materials Science

Motivation:  
Machine learning in biology and chemistry remains fragmented by varying data scales—from electronic structures to omics and tissue imaging—hindering robust model evaluation and industrial uptake. A standardized, multi‐scale benchmark will expose strengths and gaps in current approaches, accelerate algorithmic innovation, and foster reproducibility across academic and industrial settings.

Main Idea:  
We propose to curate and integrate publicly available datasets at four hierarchical levels: (1) quantum‐mechanical simulations (e.g., DFT computed energies), (2) molecular graphs (e.g., small-molecule properties), (3) protein/biopolymer sequences with functional assays, and (4) cell‐ and tissue‐level imaging or omics profiles. For each scale, we define representative tasks—property regression, reaction yield prediction, binding affinity classification, and phenotypic outcome forecasting—and establish uniform data-processing pipelines, input representations, and evaluation metrics. A centralized leaderboard and open‐source toolkit will support plug-and‐play models, from graph neural networks to diffusion models, enabling fair comparison and cross‐scale transfer learning studies. Expected outcomes include clearer benchmarking standards, identification of algorithmic bottlenecks, and accelerated translation of ML advances into real‐world materials and biomedical applications.
