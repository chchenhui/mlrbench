## 2. Introduction

### Background

Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in various scientific disciplines, including life sciences and materials science. However, the application of ML in these fields is constrained by the quality of the datasets used for training and validation. Biological and chemical datasets often contain experimental errors, inconsistencies, and biases that are challenging to detect and correct manually. This results in unreliable models and benchmarks, limiting the practical impact of ML in these domains.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a self-supervised AI system that can simultaneously curate molecular datasets and identify common data quality issues. The system will employ a dual-network architecture to enhance the quality of existing datasets and create a real-time quality assessment tool for new data sources. The research aims to:

1. Develop a self-supervised learning approach that can identify and correct inconsistencies in molecular datasets.
2. Incorporate domain knowledge through physics-based constraints and chemical feasibility checks.
3. Evaluate the performance of the proposed method using comprehensive assessment tools.
4. Demonstrate the adaptability of the system to diverse molecular data types, including protein structures, small molecules, and crystal structures.

### Significance

The successful implementation of this research will significantly accelerate the reliable application of ML in life sciences and materials discovery. By automating the quality control process, the proposed system will reduce the time and effort required for dataset curation, enabling researchers to focus on model development and application. Furthermore, the real-time quality assessment tool will facilitate the evaluation of new data sources, ensuring the consistency and reliability of ML models across diverse molecular datasets.

## 3. Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed research will follow a multi-step approach, involving data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation. The methodology can be summarized as follows:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Collect and preprocess molecular datasets, including protein structures, small molecules, and crystal structures. Apply initial quality checks to identify obvious errors and inconsistencies.

2. **Model Development**: Design a dual-network architecture consisting of a "curator network" and an "adversarial network".

   - **Curator Network**: This network will be responsible for identifying and correcting inconsistencies in the molecular datasets. It will learn patterns of experimental artifacts, inconsistent measurements, and anomalous data points by training on partially corrupted high-quality datasets. The network will incorporate domain knowledge through physics-based constraints and chemical feasibility checks.

   - **Adversarial Network**: This network will challenge the corrections made by the curator network, acting as an adversary to ensure the robustness of the curation process. It will generate synthetic data that mimic common data quality issues, helping the curator network to improve its correction capabilities.

3. **Training**: Train the dual-network architecture using a combination of supervised and self-supervised learning techniques. The curator network will be trained on labeled datasets containing known data quality issues, while the adversarial network will be trained on synthetic data generated during the curation process.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the proposed system using comprehensive assessment tools, including MOLGRAPHEVAL and other relevant benchmarks. The evaluation will focus on the accuracy, consistency, and generalization capabilities of the curation process.

3. **Model Training**: Train the adversarial network using self-supervised learning techniques on the synthetic data \(D_s\). The network will learn to generate data that challenges the corrections made by the curator network.
4. **Challenging**: Use the trained adversarial network to generate synthetic data that mimic common data quality issues, challenging the corrections made by the curator network.
5. **Output**: Synthetic data \(D_s\) that can be used to further train and evaluate the curator network.

2. **Consistency**: Assess the consistency of the curation process by comparing the corrected datasets to ground truth datasets containing known data quality issues.
3. **Generalization**: Test the generalization capabilities of the curator network by applying it to new molecular datasets that were not used during training.
4. **Efficiency**: Measure the computational efficiency of the curation process, comparing it to manual dataset curation methods.

### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the proposed system will be evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly identified and corrected inconsistencies in the molecular datasets.
