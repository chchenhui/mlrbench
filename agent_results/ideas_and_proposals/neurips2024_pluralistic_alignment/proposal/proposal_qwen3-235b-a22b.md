# Proposal for Research: Multi-Objective Value Representation (MOVR)  
**A Pluralistic Framework for Capturing Preference Diversity in AI Alignment**

---

## 1. Introduction

### Background  
As AI systems increasingly govern consequential domains such as public health, criminal justice, and content moderation, ensuring their alignment with human values remains a critical challenge. Traditional alignment paradigms often reduce moral decision-making to scalar utility functions, imposing homogeneous frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism or deontological ethics) that fail to capture the plurality of human preferences. This reductionism risks marginalizing minority perspectives and entrenching cultural biases in automated systems. The Pluralistic Alignment Workshop has highlighted the urgent need for methods that preserve value diversity while enabling AI to navigate conflicting priorities—a gap addressed by this research.

Current approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL) with simple reward functions or ethical preference aggregation, exhibit three critical shortcomings:  
1. **Oversimplification**: Collapsing diverse values into single metrics suppresses substantive disagreements.  
2. **Static Prioritization**: Defined weights on ethical criteria (e.g., equality vs. liberty) lack context sensitivity.  
3. **Opacity**: Black-box decision systems obscure which values drive specific outcomes, undermining stakeholder trust.  

### Research Objectives  
This research proposes **Multi-Objective Value Representation (MOVR)**, a technical framework to address these limitations. MOVR’s objectives are:  
1. **Representative Diversity**: Learn distinct value embeddings for subpopulations (e.g., cultural, demographic clusters) using vector-valued reinforcement learning.  
2. **Context-Sensitive Arbitration**: Dynamically apply consensus-seeking, trade-off surfacing, or adaptive weighting based on decision stakes.  
3. **Interpretable Trade-Offs**: Visualize value priorities in specific decisions to enable human oversight.  
4. **Ethically Robust Generalization**: Preserve representational capacity for unobserved value systems during deployment.  

### Significance  
MOVR advances the frontier of pluralistic AI through five contributions:  
1. **Computational Value Pluralism**: Unlike ε-satisficing (Kislev, 2022), MOVR maintains vector representations of conflicting ethical objectives (e.g., equality and liberty).  
2. **Dynamic Conflict Resolution**: Extends static adaptive weighting (Clark et al., 2023) by contextualizing arbitration strategies in decision severity.  
3. **Preference Elicitation Equity**: Addresses bias in survey methodologies (Martinez & Wilson, 2023) through stratified, semi-supervised elicitation.  
4. **Transparency by Design**: Builds on Whitbeck’s ethical scenarios (1996) to render value trade-offs explicit in natural language post-hoc explanations.  
5. **Real-World Validation**: Evaluates performance in high-stakes domains (e.g., hate speech moderation) where pluralistic alignment failures are most consequential.

## 2. Methodology

### Data Collection Framework  
We collect preference data from diverse global populations via a three-step process:  

1. **Demographic Stratification**: Recruit 5,000+ participants balancing geography (6 continents), religion (10+ self-identifications), socioeconomic status (quintiles), and political affiliation (left/right/center).  
2. **Scenario-Based Elicitation**: Present 10–15 trolley-problem-style dilemmas covering AI domains (e.g., autonomous vehicles, predictive policing). Responses include multiple criteria ratings (e.g., "How harmful is each outcome to societal trust?").  
3. **Latent Representation Learning**:  
   - Encode human responses into $ \mathbf{P} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d} $, where $ d=50 $ captures socio-demographic metadata.  
   - Train a Siamese neural net with triplet loss to cluster similar justifications, producing $ V $ value prototypes.  

### Algorithmic Design  
MOVR combines multi-objective RL with Bayesian arbitration mechanisms.  

#### Vector-Valued Q-Learning  
We model the AI’s state space as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with multiple reward channels:  
$$ \text{POMDP} = \langle S, A, T, R, \Omega, O \rangle $$  
Where $ R(s, a): S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^V $ emits a vector of rewards for $ V $ ethical values per state-action pair. The vector Q-function updates as:  
$$ Q_{\text{MOVR}}(s,a) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t \mathbf{R}_t \right] $$  
Where $ \gamma \in [0,1] $ is the discount factor.  

#### Multi-Objective Scalarization  
At decision time, MOVR applies context-dependent scalarization:  
1. **Weighted Sum Optimization**: $ J_w = \max_{\pi} \mathbb{E}[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t \mathbf{w}^T Q_{\text{MOVR}}(s,a)] $, where $ w_i \propto \pi(v_i | c, \sigma) $.  
2. **Chebyshev Scalarization**: Balances fairness across objectives using a reference point.  
3. **Expected Violation (EV) Optimization**: Prioritizes avoiding maximal violations of any value system (Robinson et al., 2023).  

#### Context-Sensitive Arbitration Mechanism  
MOVR employs a hierarchical decision tree to select arbitration strategies based on two factors:  
- **Context $ c $**: Domain-specific risk level (e.g., $ c_{\text{medical}}=3 $ for life-altering decisions).  
- **Stakes $ \sigma \in [0,1] $**: Sociopolitical charge of the decision (e.g., $ \sigma_{\text{abortion}}=0.9 $).  

$$ \text{Arbitration}(c, \sigma) = 
\begin{cases} 
\text{Consensus-seeking} & \sigma < 0.4 \\
\text{Trade-off Surfacing} & 0.4 \leq \sigma < 0.75 \\
\text{Adaptive Weighting} & \sigma \geq 0.75 
\end{cases} $$  

### Experimental Validation  

#### Case Study: Hate Speech Moderation  
1. **Dataset**: Construct a multilingual corpus with source annotations marking values (e.g., free expression, safety).  
2. **Simulation Environment**: Train MOVR on 80% data; use Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to evaluate tone moderation decisions.  
3. **Baselines**: Compare with QwenCon (majority-aggregation agent) and FairLLM (swap fairness constraints).    

#### Evaluation Metrics  
1. **Accuracy**: F1-score on flagged content (as validated by domain experts).  
2. **Representational Fidelity**: Maintain cluster separability of value prototypes using $ d'$-distance:  
   $$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{sep}} = \sum_{i=1}^V \sum_{j=i+1}^V \frac{\| \mu_i - \mu_j \|^2}{\sigma_i + \sigma_j} $$  
3. **Preference Alignment**: Success rate of quantified preferences forming part of observed decision justifications.  
4. **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: 5-point Likert scale on transparency and fairness in user studies.  
5. **Conflict Resolution Quality**: Proportion of disagreements where the arbitration strategy matches human raters’ ideal approach.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Anticipated Results  
1. **MOVR Framework**: Open-source implementations of vector RL architecture (PyTorch), arbitration protocol, and $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{sep}} $ optimization.  
2. **Harmonized Datasets**: Global value preference corpus with annotations for 1,500+ ethical scenarios.  
3. **Empirical Evidence**: Demonstration that scalarization choice impacts fairness metrics by $>30\%$ in hate speech moderation domains.  
4. **Arbitration Insights**: Systematic mapping of $\sigma$-thresholds (e.g., $ \sigma_{\text{security}}=0.6 $ triggers trade-off surfacing for free speech vs. terrorism).  

### Societal Impact  
1. **Equity in AI Governance**: Directly addresses the Pluralistic Alignment Workshop’s goal of preventing cultural erasure in AI systems. For example, MOVR could balance Western bias in content moderation against indigenous relational norms.  
2. **Democratic Oversight**: Interpretable trade-offs empower policymakers to audit value prioritization, aligning with recommendations for AI accountability frameworks.  
3. **Safety Advancements**: Vector-based violations avoidance might reduce harm amplification in consequential domains like healthcare (e.g., allocating organs without codifying racial bias).  
4. **Ethics Ecosystem**: The value prototype dataset provides a benchmark for future research on preference extrapolation and bias mitigation.  

### Limitations & Risks  
1. **Preference Elicitation Bias**: Under-representation of stateless populations (e.g., refugees) in training data could perpetuate marginalization.  
2. **Computational Complexity**: Storing vector Q-values incurs $ O(V) $ memory overhead versus scalar RL.  
3. **Malicious Adaptation**: Adversarial actors might engineer inputs to manipulate arbitration strategy selection.  

To mitigate these risks, we will:  
- Apply synthetic minorities oversampling (SMOTE) in the training phase.  
- Release lightweight approximations using attention-based Q-function factorization.  
- Publish a red-teaming dataset with 50+ adversarial scenarios to stress-test arbitration logic.

This research directly responds to workshop themes by integrating consensus-building practices (e.g., adaptive weighting mirroring deliberative democracy) and technical innovations for pluralistic AI. By maintaining separate value representations rather than collapsing preferences, MOVR enables AI systems to function as ethical intermediaries rather than moral arbiters in increasingly fragmented societies.
