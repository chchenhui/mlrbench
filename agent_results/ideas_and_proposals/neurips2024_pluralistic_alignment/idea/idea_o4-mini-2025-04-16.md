Title: Federated Consensus Value Alignment (FCVA)

Motivation:  
Existing AI alignment techniques often collapse diverse stakeholders’ values into a single objective, sidelining minority preferences and fueling conflicts. A scalable, privacy-preserving framework is needed to capture pluralistic value distributions and yield policies that stakeholders can transparently adjust.

Main Idea:  
FCVA is a four-stage framework. (1) Federated Value Modeling: User cohorts locally train value predictors on their own annotated data, with differential-privacy noise to protect individual inputs. (2) Social-Choice Aggregation: A central server collects cohort models and applies an iterative Borda-count weighting scheme—augmented with privacy-preserving perturbations—to produce a consensus value function that respects both majority and minority rankings. (3) Multi-Objective Policy Optimization: A reinforcement-learning agent optimizes a Pareto front of policies guided by each cohort’s value function, enabling explicit trade-offs. (4) Interactive Trade-Off Dashboard: Stakeholders explore and select preferred policies along the Pareto frontier via adjustable weights.  

Expected Outcomes:  
– A suite of AI behaviors that transparently encode diverse value trade-offs  
– Preservation of minority preferences via social-choice weights  
– A privacy-safe, federated pipeline for pluralistic alignment  

Potential Impact:  
FCVA democratizes AI alignment, empowering communities to co-design policies that reflect their complex, often conflicting values.
