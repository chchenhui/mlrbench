**Title:**  
**Value-Aware Clustering Networks: Explicit Modeling of Annotation Diversity for Pluralistic AI**  

**Motivation:**  
Current AI alignment methods often suppress minority perspectives by aggregating annotations via majority vote, entrenching bias against underrepresented values. This fails to address the complexity of pluralistic human preferences, particularly in subjective tasks like hate speech detection or policy recommendations.  

**Main Idea:**  
Propose a two-stage framework for dataset creation and model training:  
1. **Value-Based Clustering:** Cluster annotations using unsupervised techniques (e.g., community detection) combined with annotator metadata (e.g., demographics, value surveys) to identify distinct value groups.  
2. **Pluralistic Model Architecture:** Train a neural network with shared base layers and multiple cluster-specific heads. Each head learns patterns from a value cluster, while a dynamic attention mechanism at inference time weighs head outputs based on context (e.g., user preferences, fairness constraints).  

Evaluation metrics assess per-cluster performance and cross-cluster fairness, ensuring minority perspectives are preserved. This approach enables models to transparently represent conflicting values and adapt to diverse contexts, offering a technical pathway for pluralistic alignment without sacrificing accuracy. Potential applications include content moderation and healthcare ethics, where accommodating dissent is critical.
