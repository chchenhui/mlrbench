# GraphLang: A Unified Graph-Language Foundation Model

## Introduction

### Background

Graph-structured data underpins critical domains such as molecular chemistry, social networks, and knowledge bases. Despite recent advances in graph learning, including Transformer-based models like Graphormer and GNNs like GPR-GNN, the accessibility of graph data remains limited to specialized tools and expert knowledge. Concurrently, the rise of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and PaLM has demonstrated the power of natural language interfaces for knowledge retrieval and reasoning. However, integrating graph structural data with LLMs remains a challenge, as current models struggle to jointly process and reason over multi-modal graph-text data.

### Research Objectives

GraphLang aims to bridge this gap by developing a unified foundation model that learns joint representations of graph structures and natural language. Key objectives include:  
1. **Zero-shot graph reasoning**: Enable LLMs to perform graph tasks (e.g., pathfinding, entity linking) without task-specific fine-tuning.  
2. **Interactive graph exploration**: Allow users to query, edit, and generate graphs using natural language.  
3. **Domain-agnostic adaptability**: Generalize across knowledge graphs, molecules, and scientific networks.  

### Significance

GraphLang will democratize access to graph data by eliminating barriers to specialized tooling, enabling scientists and practitioners to:  
- Query molecular graphs for drug discovery ("Find kinase inhibitor interactions").  
- Modify knowledge bases through conversational agents.  
- Generate scene graphs for vision systems using text prompts.  

This aligns with the GLFrontiers 2023 goal of advancing graph learning in the foundation model era, directly addressing challenges in language-structural data integration and scientific discovery.

## Methodology

### Model Architecture

GraphLang employs a **multi-modal Transformer** with a graph-text co-encoder and a unified attention mechanism (Figure 1). Key components include:

1. **Graph Encoder**:  
   - A heterogeneous GNN combining graph attention and heterophily-aware aggregation (adapted from [Heterophilic Graph Learning Handbook](#1)).  
   - Node/edge embeddings are enriched with subgraph-level contextual features via hierarchical pooling:  
     $$
     \mathbf{h}_{\mathcal{G}} = \text{HierPool}(\{\mathbf{h}_v\}_{v \in \mathcal{V}}, \{\mathbf{h}_e\}_{e \in \mathcal{E}})
     $$

2. **Text Encoder**:  
   - A BERT-style Transformer for tokenizing text and generating context-aware embeddings $\mathbf{h}_{\text{seq}}$.

3. **Cross-Modal Attentive Fusion**:  
   - Joint attention layers compute interactions between graph and text tokens:  
     $$
     \mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{W}_q[\mathbf{h}_{\text{seq}}; \mathbf{h}_{\mathcal{G}}], \quad \mathbf{K} = \mathbf{W}_k[\mathbf{h}_{\text{seq}}; \mathbf{h}_{\mathcal{G}}], \quad \text{Attention} = \text{Softmax}(\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T)
     $$

### Pre-training Tasks

We introduce three self-supervised pre-training tasks:

1. **Masked Graph-Text Reconstruction (MGTR)**:  
   - Randomly mask 15% of tokens in both modalities and reconstruct them using cross-modal context. For graphs, this includes masking nodes $v$ and edges $e$:  
     $$
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{MGTR}} = -\sum_{i} \log p(x_i | \mathbf{z}_{\text{masked}}, \mathcal{G}_{\text{masked}})
     $$

2. **Subgraph-to-Text Generation (S2TG)**:  
   - Given a subgraph $\mathcal{G}' \subset \mathcal{G}$, generate a textual description $\mathbf{y}$:  
     $$
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{S2TG}} = -\sum_{t} \log p(y_t | y_{<t}, \mathbf{h}_{\mathcal{G}'})
     $$

3. **Contrastive Alignment (CA)**:  
   - Align subgraph embeddings $\mathbf{z}_{\mathcal{G}'}$ with corresponding text embeddings $\mathbf{z}_{\text{desc}}$ using normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy:  
     $$
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{CA}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{z}_{\mathcal{G}'}, \mathbf{z}_{\text{desc}})/\tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{z}_{\mathcal{G}'}, \mathbf{z}_k)/\tau)}
     $$

**Total Pre-training Loss**:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{MGTR}} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{\text{S2TG}} + \gamma \mathcal{L}_{\text{CA}}
$$

### Instruction Tuning

We curate synthetic dialogues for graph reasoning using a template-based generator. Tasks include:  
- **Subgraph Extraction**:  
  ```  
  Q: "Show interactions involving SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the PPI graph."  
  A: Highlight subgraph {ACE2, TMPRSS2, Spike}.  
  ```  
- **Graph Modification**:  
  ```  
  Q: "Add a hydrogen bond between residue Glu219 and drug AZD7442."  
  A: Update $\mathcal{G}$ with edge $E(Glu219, AZD7442)$ = [type: hydrogen bond].  
  ```  

These instructions are fine-tuned using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method to reduce computational overhead.
