## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **E(3)-Equivariant Geometric Attention Networks for High-Precision Structure-Based Drug Design**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Drug discovery and development is a notoriously long, expensive, and high-risk endeavor. Bringing a single new drug to market can take over a decade and cost billions of dollars, with high attrition rates at every stage (DiMasi et al., 2016). Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) aims to mitigate these challenges by leveraging the three-dimensional (3D) structural information of biological targets (typically proteins) and their interactions with potential drug molecules (ligands). By understanding the precise geometric and chemical complementarity between a protein's binding site and a ligand, SBDD facilitates the rational design and optimization of molecules with higher potency and specificity, potentially reducing the reliance on costly and time-consuming high-throughput screening campaigns.

In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning, has shown tremendous promise in accelerating various aspects of drug discovery (Fleming, 2018; Vamathevan et al., 2019). Within SBDD, AI models are increasingly used for tasks such as binding affinity prediction, virtual screening, and *de novo* molecule generation. However, effectively capturing the complex, 3D nature of protein-ligand interactions remains a significant challenge. Traditional machine learning models often rely on handcrafted features or simplified 2D representations, potentially losing critical spatial information. While standard 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can process volumetric data, they are sensitive to the orientation of the input structures, requiring data augmentation and leading to suboptimal performance. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling molecular structures, but standard GNNs typically operate on the graph topology and node/edge features, often inadequately capturing the underlying Euclidean geometry and its symmetries.

**2.2 State-of-the-Art and Research Gap**
To address the limitations of orientation-dependent models, E(3)-equivariant neural networks (where E(3) is the Euclidean group of rotations, translations, and reflections in 3D space) have gained traction. These models incorporate geometric symmetries directly into their architecture, ensuring that predictions are robust to the pose of the input molecules (Thomas et al., 2018; Fuchs et al., 2020). Several recent works have successfully applied E(3)-equivariant GNNs to structural biology problems, including ligand binding site prediction (EquiPocket, Zhang et al., 2023), compound-protein interaction prediction (EquiCPI, Nguyen, 2025), and general macromolecular structure analysis (Jing et al., 2021). These models demonstrate the power of encoding geometric priors for improved performance and data efficiency.

Simultaneously, attention mechanisms have proven effective in enhancing deep learning models by allowing them to focus on the most relevant parts of the input data. In the context of SBDD, attention can highlight critical atoms or residues involved in binding interactions. Models like HAC-Net (Kyro et al., 2022) and the geometric attention networks proposed by Johnson & Lee (2024) have shown improved accuracy in binding affinity prediction by integrating attention. Furthermore, hierarchical attention mechanisms (Green & Black, 2024) offer a way to model interactions at multiple scales, from atomic contacts to residue-level interactions within the binding pocket.

Despite these advances, there is a gap in integrating the geometric rigor of state-of-the-art E(3)-equivariant GNNs with sophisticated, *hierarchical* attention mechanisms specifically designed to operate on geometric features within the context of SBDD. While some works combine equivariance and attention, they may not fully capture interactions across different structural levels (atom, residue, pocket) or leverage the interplay between geometric features and attention weighting in a hierarchical manner. Existing models often focus primarily on affinity prediction, with less emphasis on leveraging these representations for high-precision, structure-guided *de novo* molecule generation.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
This research aims to develop and validate a novel deep learning framework, the **E(3)-Equivariant Geometric Attention Network (EGAN)**, for high-precision structure-based drug design. The specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop a novel E(3)-equivariant GNN architecture incorporating hierarchical geometric attention mechanisms.** This involves designing equivariant message passing layers that incorporate attention scores calculated based Tο geometric relationships (distances, angles) at multiple structural levels (atom-atom, atom-residue, residue-residue within the binding pocket).
2.  **Train and validate the EGAN model for highly accurate protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.** We will use benchmark datasets like PDBbind to demonstrate the model's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods, including both equivariant and non-equivariant models, as well as attention-based approaches.
3.  **Adapt and apply the EGAN framework for structure-guided *de novo* molecule generation.** The goal is to generate novel molecules optimized for binding within a specific protein pocket, leveraging the learned geometric and chemical interaction patterns.
4.  **Perform comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies.** We will rigorously assess the contribution of E(3)-equivariance and the hierarchical attention mechanism to model performance and analyze the model's ability to generalize and identify key binding interactions.

**2.4 Significance**
Successfully achieving these objectives would yield a powerful computational tool for SBDD. An accurate and robust EGAN model could significantly impact the early stages of drug discovery by:

*   **Accelerating Virtual Screening:** Enabling faster and more accurate identification of promising hit compounds from large virtual libraries.
*   **Improving Lead Optimization:** Guiding the modification of existing compounds to enhance binding affinity and other desired properties based on detailed structural insights.
*   **Facilitating *De Novo* Design:** Generating entirely novel molecular structures tailored to specific binding pockets, potentially uncovering new chemical scaffolds.
*   **Reducing Costs and Timelines:** By improving the predictive accuracy of computational models, EGAN could decrease the reliance on expensive and time-consuming experimental assays, thereby shortening the overall drug development cycle.
*   **Advancing AI Methodology:** Contributing a novel architecture that effectively integrates geometric symmetries and hierarchical attention for complex 3D interaction modeling, potentially applicable to other areas of structural biology and chemistry.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework**
The proposed EGAN framework combines an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network backbone with a multi-level geometric attention mechanism. The input consists of the 3D coordinates and associated features (e.g., atom type, charge) of the protein binding pocket atoms and the ligand atoms. The model processes this input through several layers of equivariant message passing, enhanced by attention, to produce representations that capture the intricate protein-ligand interactions. These representations are then fed into output heads for specific tasks: binding affinity prediction (regression) and molecule generation (conditional generation).

**3.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing**
*   **Datasets:** We will primarily use the PDBbind dataset (versions v2016 and v2020), a widely recognized benchmark containing experimentally determined 3D structures of protein-ligand complexes and their binding affinities (Liu et al., 2017). We will utilize the high-quality "refined set" for training and validation, and the "core set" for rigorous testing, following standard practices (e.g., CASF benchmarks). We may also incorporate data from BindingDB or ChEMBL for diversity, ensuring structural data is available.
*   **Preprocessing:**
    *   Protein structures will be processed to isolate the binding pocket, typically defined as residues within a certain distance (e.g., 6-8 Å) of the bound ligand. Hydrogen atoms will be added using standard tools (e.g., Open Babel, PyMol with `h_add`).
    *   Ligand structures will be standardized, and protonation states assigned (e.g., using ChemAxon or RDKit).
    *   Both protein and ligand atoms will be represented as nodes in a graph.
    *   **Node Features ($h_i$):** Initial node features will include one-hot encoded atom types, element properties (e.g., electronegativity, covalent radius), formal charge, hybridization state, and potentially residue type information for protein atoms. Crucially, initial node features also include the 3D coordinates $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$.
    *   **Edge Features ($e_{ij}$):** Edges can be constructed based on distance cutoffs or covalent bonds. Edge features may include distance, bond type (if applicable), and potentially relative geometric information.
*   **Data Splitting:** To ensure robust evaluation and prevent data leakage, we will employ rigorous splitting strategies. This includes temporal splits (if using multiple PDBbind versions) and structure-based clustering splits (e.g., splitting based on protein similarity or binding site similarity) to assess generalization capabilities.

**3.3 Model Architecture: E(3)-Equivariant Geometric Attention Network (EGAN)**

*   **Input Representation:** The protein-ligand complex is represented as a graph $G=(V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of atoms (nodes) from both the protein pocket and the ligand, and $E$ represents interactions or connections between them (e.g., within a distance cutoff). Each node $i$ has initial scalar features $s_i$ and coordinate features $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$. We can combine these into a feature vector $h_i^{(0)} = (s_i, x_i)$.

*   **E(3)-Equivariant Layers:** We will build upon established E(3)-equivariant architectures like Tensor Field Networks (TFN) (Thomas et al., 2018) or Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) (Satorras et al., 2021). An E(3)-equivariant layer $\Phi$ updates node features $h_i = (s_i, x_i)$ such that for any transformation $g \in E(3)$ (rotation $R$, translation $t$):
    $$ \Phi(g \cdot H) = g \cdot \Phi(H) $$
    where $g \cdot H$ applies the rotation $R$ to all coordinates $x_i$ and vector features, and adds the translation $t$ to coordinates. A typical EGNN-style update at layer $l$ involves message passing and feature aggregation:

    1.  **Message Calculation:** Messages $m_{ij}$ are computed between nodes $i$ and $j$, often depending on scalar features $s_i^{(l)}, s_j^{(l)}$ and relative positions $x_i^{(l)} - x_j^{(l)}$, and potentially edge features $e_{ij}$.
        $$ m_{ij}^{(l)} = \phi_e (s_i^{(l)}, s_j^{(l)}, \|x_i^{(l)} - x_j^{(l)}\|^2, e_{ij}) $$
        where $\phi_e$ is typically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP).

    2.  **Coordinate Update (Equivariant):** Coordinates are updated based on weighted messages, ensuring equivariance.
        $$ x_i^{(l+1)} = x_i^{(l)} + C \sum_{j \neq i} (x_i^{(l)} - x_j^{(l)}) \phi_x(m_{ij}^{(l)}) $$
        where $\phi_x$ outputs a scalar weight, and $C$ is a normalization constant.

    3.  **Scalar Feature Update (Invariant):** Scalar features are updated using aggregated messages.
        $$ m_i^{(l)} = \sum_{j \neq i} m_{ij}^{(l)} $$
        $$ s_i^{(l+1)} = \phi_s (s_i^{(l)}, m_i^{(l)}) $$
        where $\phi_s$ is another MLP.

*   **Hierarchical Geometric Attention Mechanism:** We propose integrating attention *within* the message passing or aggregation steps, making the updates adaptive. The key innovation is the *hierarchical* and *geometric* nature of this attention.

    1.  **Atom-Level Attention:** Attention weights $\alpha_{ij}^{(l)}$ are computed between interacting atoms $i$ and $j$, based not only on their features but also their geometric relationship (distance, relative orientation derived from positions $x_i, x_j$).
        $$ e_{ij}^{(l)} = \text{AttentionScore}(h_i^{(l)}, h_j^{(l)}, x_i^{(l)}, x_j^{(l)}) $$
        $$ \alpha_{ij}^{(l)} = \text{softmax}_j(e_{ij}^{(l)}) $$
        The message $m_{ij}^{(l)}$ or aggregation $m_i^{(l)}$ is then weighted by $\alpha_{ij}^{(l)}$. This attention score function needs to be carefully designed to be invariant or appropriately equivariant depending on how it's used. For instance, using distances $\|x_i - x_j\|$ and scalar products of relative position vectors with feature vectors ensures invariance/equivariance.

    2.  **Residue/Pocket-Level Attention:** After initial atom-level updates, atom features within the same residue (or within local geometric clusters) can be aggregated (e.g., via pooling). Attention can then be computed between these aggregated residue/cluster representations or between ligand atoms and residue representations. This coarser level of attention helps identify key residues or sub-pockets critical for binding, capturing longer-range or collective effects. The aggregation function $\text{Aggregate}$ and attention $\text{AttentionScore}_{\text{Residue}}$ need to handle potentially variable numbers of atoms per residue and maintain geometric context.
        $$ h_{\text{Res}, k}^{(l')} = \text{Aggregate}_{\text{Res}, k} (\{ (h_i^{(l')}, x_i^{(l')}) \mid i \in \text{Residue } k \}) $$
        $$ \alpha_{k, \text{lig}}^{(l')} = \text{AttentionScore}_{\text{Residue}}(h_{\text{Res}, k}^{(l')}, h_{\text{lig}}^{(l')}) $$
        where $h_{\text{lig}}^{(l')}$ is an aggregated representation of the ligand.

    These attention weights modulate the information flow, allowing the model to focus on geometrically and chemically relevant interactions at different scales.

*   **Output Layers:**
    *   **Affinity Prediction:** The final node features (particularly those of the ligand or interface atoms) are pooled using an E(3)-invariant pooling mechanism (e.g., summing or averaging scalar features, using invariant geometric statistics) to produce a global representation vector. This vector is passed through an MLP to regress the binding affinity value ($\Delta G$ or $pK_d/pK_i$).
    *   **Molecule Generation:** We will explore conditional generation approaches. Given a protein pocket structure (processed by the EGAN encoder), the model generates a molecule atom-by-atom or fragment-by-fragment within the pocket. The EGAN's learned representation provides context, guiding the placement and selection of atoms/fragments to maximize predicted binding affinity while ensuring geometric validity and chemical feasibility. This could involve autoregressive generation, diffusion models conditioned on the pocket representation, or reinforcement learning approaches where the reward is based on predicted affinity and drug-likeness properties.

**3.4 Training Procedure**
*   **Affinity Prediction:** The model will be trained end-to-end using a regression loss, typically Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE), between the predicted and experimental binding affinities.
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{affinity}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \quad (\text{MSE}) $$
*   **Molecule Generation:** Training will depend on the chosen generation strategy. For autoregressive models, it might involve maximizing the likelihood of ground-truth ligand atoms/bonds given the context. For RL-based approaches, the policy network (generator) will be trained using policy gradients (e.g., REINFORCE) with rewards combining predicted affinity (from the EGAN prediction head, possibly frozen), validity, drug-likeness (QED), and synthetic accessibility (SA).
*   **Optimization:** We will use the Adam or AdamW optimizer with appropriate learning rate scheduling (e.g., linear warmup and cosine decay). Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, layer sizes, number of layers, attention heads, distance cutoffs) will be performed using a validation set or cross-validation.

**3.5 Experimental Design**

        *   **Uniqueness:** Percentage of unique molecules among valid ones.
        *   **Novelty:** Percentage of unique, valid molecules not present in the training set.
        *   **Property Distribution:** Comparison of generated molecules' properties (QED, SA score, LogP, molecular weight) against the distribution in known drug databases (e.g., ZINC, ChEMBL).
        *   **Binding Potential:** Predicted binding affinity (using the trained EGAN model or other predictors) and docking scores (using AutoDock Vina) of the generated molecules re-docked into the target pocket.

*   **Ablation Studies:**
    *   **Equivariance:** Compare the full EGAN model against a version where coordinates are treated merely as node features without enforcing equivariance (e.g., using a standard GAT).
    *   **Attention:** Compare the full model against versions with (i) no attention, (ii) only atom-level attention, (iii) only residue-level attention.
    *   **Feature Importance:** Analyze attention weights to understand which atoms/residues/interactions the model deems important for prediction.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

*   **Outcome 1: State-of-the-Art Affinity Prediction:** We expect EGAN to outperform existing methods on standard binding affinity benchmarks (e.g., PDBbind core sets, CASF), achieving lower RMSE/MAE and higher correlation coefficients. The integration of E(3)-equivariance and hierarchical geometric attention should provide superior modeling of the complex 3D interaction landscape.
*   **Outcome 2: High-Quality Molecule Generation:** The framework is expected to generate novel, valid molecules specifically tailored to target binding pockets. We anticipate generated molecules will exhibit favorable predicted binding affinities and possess drug-like properties comparable to or exceeding those from baseline generative models.
*   **Outcome 3: Enhanced Interpretability:** Analysis of the hierarchical attention weights may provide insights into key protein-ligand interactions driving binding affinity, potentially highlighting specific atoms, residues, or sub-pocket regions critical for binding, thus aiding medicinal chemists.
*   **Outcome 4: Robust and Generalizable Model:** Due to the incorporated geometric symmetries (equivariance) and adaptive focus (attention), we expect the model to exhibit better generalization across diverse protein targets and chemical scaffolds compared to non-equivariant or non-attentive models.
*   **Outcome 5: Open-Source Contribution:** We plan to release the model implementation and potentially pre-trained weights to facilitate further research and adoption by the community.

**Impact:** This research has the potential to significantly advance the field of AI-driven drug discovery. By providing a more accurate and geometrically informed model for predicting protein-ligand binding and generating optimized molecules, EGAN could streamline the hit-to-lead and lead optimization phases. This could translate into substantial savings in time and resources for pharmaceutical research, ultimately accelerating the delivery of novel therapeutics to patients. The development of sophisticated methods integrating geometric deep learning and attention mechanisms will also contribute valuable tools and insights applicable to broader challenges in computational chemistry and structural biology. Addressing the key challenges identified in the literature (complex interaction modeling, generalization, interpretability) through this integrated approach represents a meaningful step forward for the field.
