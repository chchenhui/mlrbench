### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Deep learning optimization often operates in regimes that defy classical theoretical assumptions. The *Edge of Stability (EoS)* phenomenon, where training proceeds despite the sharpness (spectral radius of the Hessian) exceeding the stability threshold $2/\eta$ (with $\eta$ as the learning rate), exemplifies the gap between theory and practice. While first-order optimizers like SGD and Adam underpin modern deep learning, they typically ignore curvature information, leading to unstable convergence trajectories and suboptimal generalization. Recent theoretical work (e.g., Cohen et al., 2022; Damian et al., 2022) identifies EoS as a critical phase where gradient descent navigates high-curvature regions while maintaining stable loss decay. However, existing optimizers do not explicitly leverage curvature insights from this regime, missing opportunities to enhance stability and generalization.  

**Research Objectives**  
1. Propose **Dynamic Curvature-Aware Optimizer (DCAO)**, a second-order-informed optimizer that periodically computes local curvature metrics (spectral radius, spectral gap) via efficient Hessian approximation.  
2. Develop theoretical guarantees for DCAO under non-smooth loss landscapes and EoS conditions.  
3. Empirically validate DCAO’s ability to stabilize training, accelerate convergence, and improve generalization across vision and language tasks.  
4. Analyze how dynamic hyperparameter adaptation bridges the gap between optimization theory and practical training dynamics.  

**Significance**  
By integrating periodic curvature measurements into adaptive optimization, DCAO addresses the disconnect between the EoS theory and empirical training pipelines. This work advances optimization theory by explicitly modeling how curvature-aware hyperparameter adjustments improve stability, fills a methodological gap in practical second-order optimization, and provides insights into the implicit regularization effects of adaptive curvature exploitation.

### 2. **Methodology**  

**Research Design Overview**  
DCAO combines low-rank Hessian approximation, spectral analysis, and dynamic hyperparameter adaptation. The workflow (Fig. 1) involves three phases:  
1. **Periodic Curvature Probing**: Compute top-$k$ Hessian eigenpairs at intervals using stochastic Lanczos.  
2. **Curvature Metric Extraction**: Derive spectral radius $\lambda_1$ (maximum eigenvalue) and spectral gap $\Delta = \lambda_1 - \lambda_2$.  
3. **Hyperparameter Adaptation**: Adjust learning rate $\eta$, momentum $\beta$, and weight decay $\gamma$ based on $\lambda_1$ and $\Delta$.

**Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
- **Vision Tasks**: Train ResNet-50, Vision Transformer (ViT) on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet.  
- **Language Tasks**: Fine-tune BERT and GPT-2 on GLUE benchmark and causal language modeling.  
- **Synthetic Data**: Generate non-convex loss landscapes to test theoretical assumptions (e.g., degenerate saddle points).  

**Algorithmic Details**  

**1. Low-Rank Hessian Approximation**  
At every $T$ steps, compute the top-$k$ eigenpairs of the Hessian $\mathbf{H}$ using stochastic Lanczos iterations. Let $\mathbf{v}_i$ and $\lambda_i$ denote the $i$-th eigenvector and eigenvalue. For stochastic Hessian-vector products (HVPs), use a mini-batch $\mathcal{B}$:  
$$  
\mathbf{Hv} \approx \frac{1}{|\mathcal{B}|} \sum_{(x,y) \in \mathcal{B}} \nabla^2_\theta \mathcal{L}(f_\theta(x), y) \mathbf{v}.  
$$  
The Lanczos algorithm iteratively constructs a tridiagonal matrix $\mathbf{T}_m$ of size $m \times m$ (typically $m=20$), yielding Ritz values $\{\tilde{\lambda}_i\}$ as eigenvalue estimates.  

**2. Curvature Metrics**  
- **Spectral Radius**: $\lambda_1 = \max_i \tilde{\lambda}_i$  
- **Spectral Gap**: $\Delta = \lambda_1 - \lambda_2$  

**3. Hyperparameter Adaptation Rules**  
- **Learning Rate**: Adjust based on $\lambda_1$ relative to EoS threshold $2/\eta$:  
$$  
\eta_{t+1} = \begin{cases}  
\eta_t \cdot \alpha_{\text{decay}} & \text{if } \lambda_1 > 2/(\eta_t \cdot \kappa) \quad \text{(high curvature)} \\  
\eta_t \cdot \alpha_{\text{grow}} & \text{if } \lambda_1 \leq 2/(\eta_t \cdot \kappa) \quad \text{(safe region)}  
\end{cases}  
$$  
where $\kappa \in (0, 1]$ is a stability margin.  

- **Momentum**: Scale $\beta_t$ using spectral gap $\Delta$ to exploit directions of lower curvature:  
$$  
\beta_{t+1} = \beta_0 + (1 - \beta_0) \cdot \tanh(\Delta / \tau),  
$$  
with temperature $\tau$ controlling sensitivity.  

- **Weight Decay**: Modulate $\gamma_t$ to penalize sharp minima:  
$$  
\gamma_{t+1} = \gamma_0 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_{\text{ref}}}\right),  
$$  
where $\lambda_{\text{ref}}$ is a reference sharpness.  

**4. Theoretical Analysis**  
Under assumptions of $L$-smoothness and $\mu$-strong convexity in local regions, derive convergence bounds for DCAO. Let $J(\theta_t)$ denote the loss. For a single update step:  
$$  
\mathbb{E}[J(\theta_{t+1})] \leq J(\theta_t) - \eta_t \left(1 - \frac{\eta_t L_t}{2}\right) \|\nabla J(\theta_t)\|^2 + \frac{\eta_t^2 L_t \sigma^2}{2},  
$$  
where $L_t$ is the local smoothness modulated by $\lambda_1$, and $\sigma^2$ bounds gradient noise.  

**Experimental Validation**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against SGD, Adam, AdaHessian, ADLER, and Hi-DLR.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - Training dynamics: Iterations to convergence, loss trajectory stability.  
  - Generalization: Test accuracy, ECE (calibration error).  
  - Sharpness: Maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian post-training.  
  - Computational Overhead: Time per epoch vs. baseline optimizers.  
- **Ablation Studies**: Disentangle contributions of spectral radius vs. spectral gap adaptation.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Algorithmic Stability**: DCAO will maintain lower gradient norm variance compared to Adam and SGD in high-curvature regimes (validated via loss trajectory plots).  
2. **Generalization Improvement**: Vision models will achieve 1–3% higher test accuracy on CIFAR-100/ImageNet; language models will show 2–5% lower perplexity on language modeling tasks.  
3. **Theoretical Insights**: Proof of convergence for non-convex objectives under dynamic learning rates informed by $\lambda_1$ and $\Delta$.  
4. **Computational Efficiency**: DCAO will incur <10% overhead per epoch vs. Adam, with Hessian probing occurring every $T=100$ steps.  

**Impact**  
DCAO bridges the gap between EoS theory and practical optimization by introducing a mathematically grounded, curvature-aware adaptation mechanism. The outcomes will advance optimization theory by formalizing the link between spectral properties and hyperparameter schedules, while practical implementations will enable more robust training of large models. By open-sourcing DCAO, we aim to influence optimizer design in frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, fostering adoption in industrial and academic settings.

**Conclusion**  
This proposal outlines a principled approach to co-designing optimization algorithms with theoretical insights from the Edge of Stability. By dynamically adapting to local curvature, DCAO addresses key challenges in non-smooth optimization while offering practical benefits for modern deep learning workflows. Successful implementation will narrow the theory-practice divide and inspire further research into adaptive, geometry-aware training methods.
