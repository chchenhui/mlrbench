   - **Authors**: Ruta Binkyte, Ivaxi Sheth, Zhijing Jin, Mohammad Havaei, Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf, Mario Fritz
   - **Summary**: This paper advocates for integrating causal methods into machine learning to navigate trade-offs among key principles of trustworthy ML, including fairness, privacy, robustness, accuracy, and explainability. The authors argue that a causal approach is essential for balancing multiple competing objectives in both trustworthy ML and foundation models.

3. **Title**: Fairness without Demographics through Adversarially Reweighted Learning (arXiv:2006.13114)
   - **Authors**: Preethi Lahoti, Alex Beutel, Jilin Chen, Kang Lee, Flavien Prost, Nithum Thain, Xuezhi Wang, Ed H. Chi
   - **Summary**: This work addresses the problem of training ML models to improve fairness without access to protected group memberships. The authors propose Adversarially Reweighted Learning (ARL), which co-trains an adversarial reweighting approach using non-protected features and task labels to identify and mitigate fairness issues.

4. **Title**: Marrying Fairness and Explainability in Supervised Learning (arXiv:2204.02947)
   - **Authors**: Przemyslaw Grabowicz, Nicholas Perello, Aarshee Mishra
   - **Summary**: This paper formalizes direct discrimination as a direct causal effect of protected attributes on decisions and proposes post-processing methods to nullify the influence of protected attributes while preserving the influence of remaining features. The methods aim to prevent direct discrimination and diminish various disparity measures.

**Key Challenges**:

1. **Interdependencies Among Regulatory Principles**: Addressing fairness, privacy, and explainability in isolation can lead to unintended conflicts or trade-offs, such as improving fairness at the expense of privacy or model accuracy.

2. **Complexity of Causal Modeling**: Developing accurate causal graphs that capture the intricate relationships between data features, model decisions, and regulation-violating pathways is challenging and requires sophisticated techniques.

3. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Implementing multi-objective adversarial training to jointly enforce compliance with multiple regulatory principles necessitates balancing competing objectives, which can be computationally intensive and complex.

4. **Evaluation and Benchmarking**: Creating comprehensive "regulatory stress-test" benchmarks with both synthetic and real-world datasets to empirically measure trade-offs and identify root causes of conflicts is essential but resource-intensive.

5. **Generalization Across Domains**: Ensuring that the proposed causal framework and methods generalize effectively across various high-risk domains, such as healthcare and finance, poses significant challenges due to domain-specific nuances.
