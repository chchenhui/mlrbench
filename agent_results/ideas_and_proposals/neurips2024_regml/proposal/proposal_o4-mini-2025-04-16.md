1. Title  
Causal Disentanglement for Regulatory Harmony: A Unified Framework for Fairness, Privacy, and Explainability in Machine Learning  

2. Introduction  
Background  
As machine learning (ML) permeates high-stakes domains such as finance, healthcare, and criminal justice, regulatory bodies worldwide have issued guidelines to ensure algorithmic decisions are fair, private, and explainable. Examples include the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) with its “right to be forgotten” and “right to explanation,” various U.S. fairness statutes, and sector‐specific privacy rules (e.g., HIPAA in healthcare). Despite abundant technical work on fairness, privacy, or interpretability individually, there is a critical gap in unifying these desiderata under one algorithmic roof. In practice, optimizing for fairness alone can harm privacy (e.g., by leaking sensitive attributes) or reduce the interpretability of decision rules. Conversely, enforcing strict differential privacy can inadvertently obscure fairness‐critical signal. This fractured landscape risks partial compliance—models that satisfy one regulatory principle but violate another—and may expose organizations to legal liabilities and social backlash.

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to build a principled causal framework that disentangles and harmonizes fairness, privacy, and explainability in ML models. Our specific objectives are:  
  • O1. Model the causal structure linking input features, sensitive attributes, latent confounders, and predictions, so as to identify “regulation‐violating pathways.”  
  • O2. Design a multi‐objective adversarial training scheme with dedicated discriminators for fairness, privacy, and explanations, enabling joint optimization of all three.  
  • O3. Construct a “regulatory stress‐test” benchmark—comprised of synthetic and real‐world datasets (e.g., COMPAS, UCI Adult, MIMIC–III)—to systematically evaluate trade‐offs and detect root causes of regulatory conflicts.  

Significance  
Our work directly addresses the call in recent literature (e.g., Binkyte et al. 2025; Ji et al. 2023) for causal methods to navigate trustworthiness trade‐offs. By unifying three major regulatory axes in one end‐to‐end framework, we will:  
  • Provide theoretical guarantees on when and why multi‐principle compliance is possible.  
  • Offer a turnkey auditing tool for practitioners to certify ML systems against multiple regulations simultaneously.  
  • Accelerate the responsible deployment of ML in regulated industries by closing the gap between policy and algorithm.

3. Methodology  
3.1 Causal Graph Construction  
We represent the domain by a Structural Causal Model (SCM)  
  • Nodes: X ∈ ℝᵈ (non-sensitive features), A ∈ {0,1}ᵖ (sensitive attributes), Y ∈ ℝ or {0,1} (target), U (unobserved confounders).  
  • Edges: a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G = (V,E) encoding causal dependencies. For each node Vᵢ, there is a structural equation  
$$
V_i = f_i(\mathrm{PA}_i, N_i)
$$  
where PAᵢ are parents of Vᵢ in G and Nᵢ is exogenous noise.  

Step 1: Expert‐guided skeleton. We elicit domain knowledge to propose the likely direct edges (e.g., A → X, A → Y, X → Y).  
Step 2: Data‐driven refinement. We apply a causal discovery algorithm (e.g., PC or GES) on observational data to confirm or remove weak edges, subject to domain constraints.  
Step 3: Identification of regulation‐violating paths. By d‐separation, any active path A → … → Ŷ indicates potential direct or indirect discrimination; similarly, X →{inference}→ A signals privacy leakage.

3.2 Multi‐Objective Adversarial Training  
We build a predictor network f_θ : (X,A) → ŷ and three adversaries:  
  • D_f(·) for fairness: discriminates whether ŷ depends on A.  
  • D_p(·) for privacy: infers A from internal representations.  
  • D_e(·) for explainability: checks whether model explanations align with a simple, human‐interpretable surrogate.  

Loss functions:  
  • Task loss  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{task}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(x,a,y)}\bigl[\ell\bigl(f_\theta(x,a),\,y\bigr)\bigr],
$$  
where ℓ could be cross‐entropy or MSE.  
  • Fairness adversarial loss  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{fair}(\theta, \phi_f) 
= 
\mathbb{E}_{(x,a)}\bigl[\log D_f\bigl(h_\theta(x,a)\bigr)\bigr]
+ 
\mathbb{E}_{(x,a')}[\log(1 - D_f(h_\theta(x,a')))],
$$  
where h_θ is the representation just before prediction and a′ is a counterfactual sensitive attribute.  
  • Privacy adversarial loss  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{priv}(\theta, \phi_p) 
= 
\mathbb{E}_{(x,a)}\bigl[\log D_p(h_\theta(x,a))\bigr]
+
\mathbb{E}_{(x,a)}\bigl[\log(1 - D_p(h_\theta(x,a)))\bigr]\!,
$$  
where we maximize D_p’s error.  
  • Explainability loss  
We generate explanations E_θ(x,a) via integrated gradients or SHAP and train D_e to distinguish machine explanations from oracle explanations E^*(x,a). The adversarial objective is  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{exp}(\theta,\phi_e)
= 
\mathbb{E}_{x}\bigl[\|E_\theta(x,a) - E^*(x,a)\|_1\bigr]
- \lambda_e\,
\mathbb{E}_{x}\bigl[\log D_e(E_\theta(x,a))\bigr].
$$  

Overall min–max objective:  
$$
\min_{\theta}\max_{\phi_f,\phi_p,\phi_e}\;
\alpha\,\mathcal{L}_{task}
- \beta\,\mathcal{L}_{fair}
- \gamma\,\mathcal{L}_{priv}
+ \delta\,\mathcal{L}_{exp},
$$  
where hyperparameters α,β,γ,δ trade off competing goals.

Algorithmic Steps (Pseudo-code):  
1. Initialize θ, φ_f, φ_p, φ_e.  
2. For each batch {(xᵢ,aᵢ,yᵢ)}:  
   a. Construct counterfactuals {(xᵢ,aᵢ′)} by sampling aᵢ′∼P(A).  
   b. Compute representations hᵢ = h_θ(xᵢ,aᵢ).  
   c. Update φ_f to maximize L_fair; update φ_p to maximize L_priv; update φ_e to maximize L_exp.  
   d. Update θ by descending the overall objective.  
3. Repeat until convergence.

3.3 Regulatory Stress-Test Benchmark  
We will release a suite of datasets and evaluation scenarios:  
  • Synthetic SCM data with controlled A→Y and A→X effects, allowing ground‐truth measurement of path‐specific effects.  
  • Real‐world datasets: UCI Adult (income fairness), COMPAS (recidivism), MIMIC–III (medical risk), Lending Club (credit decisions).  
  • Scenario generators:  
    – Vary the strength of causal edges to simulate strong vs. weak biases.  
    – Introduce adversarial triggers to test privacy leakage (e.g., membership inference attacks).  
    – Create synthetic “explanation drift” by permuting feature contributions.  

3.4 Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics  
Baselines:  
  • Vanilla predictor f_θ without adversaries.  
  • Fair-only (β>0, γ=δ=0) adversarial training.  
  • Privacy‐only (γ>0) with DP‐SGD [Abadi et al., 2016].  
  • Explainability‐only (δ>0) post‐hoc methods.  

Metrics:  
  – Accuracy / RMSE on held-out test set.  
  – Fairness: demographic parity difference, equalized odds gap.  
  – Privacy: advantage of membership inference attack, Rényi differential privacy ε.  
  – Explainability: fidelity (correlation between Δy predicted by explanations vs. actual Δy), stability (variance of explanation under small input perturbations).  
  – Causal calibration error: discrepancy between estimated and true path‐specific effects (for synthetic data).  

Protocol:  
  1. Hyperparameter search via grid on {α,β,γ,δ}.  
  2. 5-fold cross‐validation to report mean±std of all metrics.  
  3. Ablation studies disabling one adversary at a time.  
  4. Sensitivity analysis across causal edge strengths.  
  5. Visualization of trade‐off frontiers in radar plots and Pareto curves.

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate the following outcomes:  
  1. A theoretically grounded framework that characterizes when a single model can simultaneously guarantee bounds on fairness, privacy, and explanation fidelity, and when trade‐offs are inherent (via causal path analysis).  
  2. A modular multi‐adversary architecture with open‐source implementation, enabling practitioners to plug in domain-specific definitions of fairness, privacy, or explanations.  
  3. The “Regulatory Stress-Test” benchmark, publicly available with code to reproduce synthetic scenarios, evaluation scripts, and pre‐processed real‐world splits.  
  4. Empirical evidence demonstrating that our joint framework outperforms sequential or isolated approaches in achieving balanced compliance, reducing discrimination metrics by ≥30% over vanilla models while controlling privacy leakage under ε≤1 and preserving ≥90% explanation fidelity.

Impact  
  • Academic: Establishes a new paradigm for causal disentanglement of regulatory objectives, inspiring follow‐up work on other principles (e.g., robustness, sustainability).  
  • Industry: Provides a certified toolchain for firms deploying ML in regulated sectors to audit and remediate models before release.  
  • Policy: Offers regulators a transparent methodology to test whether submitted ML products genuinely comply with multi‐axis regulations, thus bridging the policy‐technical divide.  

In summary, this research will deliver both theoretical insights and practical software to harmonize competing regulatory demands, paving the way for trustworthy and legally compliant AI systems across critical domains.
