# Automated Regulatory Compliance Monitoring for ML Systems

## Motivation
Despite increasing regulations on machine learning deployments, organizations often struggle to continuously monitor their ML systems for compliance. Regulatory requirements evolve, model behavior drifts over time, and manual auditing is resource-intensive. This discrepancy between initial compliance and ongoing adherence creates significant legal and ethical risks. Current solutions mostly focus on pre-deployment certification rather than continuous monitoring, leaving a critical gap in ensuring sustained regulatory compliance throughout an ML system's lifecycle.

## Main Idea
I propose developing an automated regulatory compliance monitoring framework that continuously evaluates deployed ML systems against evolving regulatory requirements. The framework would consist of: (1) A regulatory knowledge base that semantically maps regulatory principles to measurable technical properties; (2) Automated monitoring probes that regularly test ML systems for compliance without disrupting operations; (3) A drift detection component that identifies when model behavior shifts away from compliance boundaries; and (4) An interpretable reporting system that generates human-readable compliance reports for both technical teams and regulators. The system would enable continuous compliance verification against multiple regulatory frameworks (GDPR, CCPA, AI Act, etc.) simultaneously, with minimal human intervention. This approach bridges the gap between static regulatory requirements and dynamic ML systems, enabling organizations to maintain compliance throughout the entire model lifecycle.
