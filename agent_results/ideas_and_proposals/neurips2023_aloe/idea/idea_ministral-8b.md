### Title: Dynamic Curriculum Learning for Open-Ended Reinforcement Learning

### Motivation
Open-ended reinforcement learning (RL) aims to enable agents to continually learn and adapt to novel challenges, mirroring human intelligence. Current RL methods often struggle to maintain open-ended learning once the initial task is mastered. This research seeks to address this by developing a dynamic curriculum learning approach that continuously adapts to the agent's evolving capabilities, ensuring sustained open-ended learning.

### Main Idea
This research proposes a dynamic curriculum learning framework that leverages quality-diversity algorithms to generate a diverse set of training environments. The core idea involves an adaptive curriculum generator that adjusts the difficulty and complexity of tasks based on the agent's performance and the emergence of new capabilities. The methodology includes:
1. **Initialization**: Start with a diverse set of initial tasks.
2. **Performance Assessment**: Continuously evaluate the agent's performance on these tasks.
3. **Curriculum Adaptation**: Use a quality-diversity algorithm to generate new tasks that are neither too easy nor too hard for the current agent, ensuring continuous challenge.
4. **Self-Improvement**: Allow the agent to generate its own training data based on its current understanding, fostering self-supervised learning.

Expected outcomes include agents capable of sustained open-ended learning, improved performance in sim2real scenarios, and enhanced out-of-distribution generalization. The potential impact lies in the development of more versatile and adaptable AI systems, capable of handling real-world complexities and evolving environments.
