**Title:** Curriculum Learning via Latent Structure Discovery in Open-Ended Environments

**Motivation:** Open-ended learning (OEL) systems generate an endless stream of tasks, risking inefficient training on redundant challenges or overwhelming agents with uninformative variations. To accelerate skill acquisition and foster generalization, agents need curricula focused on tasks introducing genuinely novel structural complexities.

**Main Idea:** We propose leveraging large generative models (LGMs) to actively analyze the stream of tasks emerging from an OEL process. An auxiliary LGM will be trained to embed tasks based on their underlying structural properties (e.g., causal relationships, compositional elements, required skills), distinct from superficial features. By clustering these embeddings or identifying compositional relationships (e.g., Task C requires skills from Task A and B), the system detects structural novelty. This information then drives an adaptive curriculum generator, prioritizing tasks that introduce novel structural elements or require new skill compositions, thereby accelerating the agent's mastery of diverse, fundamental capabilities and improving generalization within the open-ended space.
