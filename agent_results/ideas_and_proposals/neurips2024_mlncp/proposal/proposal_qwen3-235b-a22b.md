# Physics-Informed Deep Equilibrium Models for Analog Hardware Co-Design  

## Introduction  

### Background  
Digital computing architectures, despite their ubiquity in modern machine learning (ML), face fundamental limitations in scalability, energy efficiency, and sustainability due to physical constraints in transistor miniaturization and the von Neumann bottleneck. Concurrently, the explosive growth of generative AI and large-scale models has intensified demand for computational resources, prompting exploration of non-traditional paradigms such as analog, neuromorphic, and physical computing systems. These emerging hardware platforms promise orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency by leveraging the intrinsic physics of devices—such as resistive memory arrays, photonic circuits, or memristive systems—to perform compute operations. However, their practical adoption is hindered by noise, limited precision (e.g., 4–6 bits), device mismatch, and restricted support for nonlinear operations, which degrade the performance of conventional ML models.  

Deep equilibrium networks (DEQs) offer a compelling bridge between ML and physical systems. Unlike traditional deep networks that propagate inputs through fixed layers, DEQs model outputs as fixed points of iterative dynamical systems:  
$$
\mathbf{z}^* = f(\mathbf{z}^*; \mathbf{x}, \boldsymbol{\theta}),
$$  
where $\mathbf{z}^*$ is the equilibrium state, $\mathbf{x}$ is the input, and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ are parameters. This formulation mirrors the behavior of physical systems that naturally converge to steady states, suggesting a synergy between DEQs and analog hardware. By co-designing DEQs with analog substrates, we can exploit the hardware’s native dynamics to accelerate equilibrium computation while mitigating its limitations through algorithmic innovation.  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to:  
1. Develop a **hybrid analog-digital DEQ framework** where analog circuits *natively implement* the dynamical system’s convergence phase, while digital layers parameterize input and feedback terms.  
2. Design a **physics-aware training algorithm** that incorporates differentiable proxies for analog hardware imperfections (noise, low precision) during backpropagation, ensuring robustness to real-world hardware constraints.  
3. Validate the framework on tasks requiring sequential state convergence (e.g., physics simulations, control systems), demonstrating significant gains in energy efficiency and speed over digital baselines.  

### Significance  
This work addresses critical challenges in analog ML (noise tolerance, scalability, and energy efficiency) while advancing DEQs as a model class uniquely suited to non-traditional hardware. Success would enable sustainable, low-power ML systems for edge robotics, real-time optimization, and scientific computing, redefining the co-design paradigm between ML algorithms and physical substrates.

## Methodology  

### Hybrid Architecture Design  

#### Physics-Informed DEQ Formulation  
We define a DEQ where the equilibrium condition incorporates physical priors and hardware constraints:  
$$
\mathbf{z}^* = \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{z}^*; \mathbf{x}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{digital}}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{analog}}),
$$  
Here, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{digital}}$ parameterizes digital layers (input encoding, feedback weights), while $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{analog}}$ represents analog hardware states (e.g., conductance values in memristors). The operator $\mathcal{F}$ encodes both the task-specific dynamics (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow) and hardware-specific physics (e.g., thermal noise in resistors).  

#### Analog-Digital Interface  
The architecture (Fig. 1) divides computation into:  
1. **Digital Parameterization**: Input $\mathbf{x}$ is embedded via a neural network into a high-dimensional representation $\mathbf{u} = \phi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{digital}}}(\mathbf{x})$.  
2. **Analog Equilibrium Solver**: A physical system (e.g., RLC circuit, photonic resonator) evolves under dynamics:  
$$
\tau \frac{d\mathbf{z}}{dt} = -\mathbf{z}(t) + f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{analog}}}(\mathbf{z}(t), \mathbf{u}),
$$  
where $\tau$ is the system’s time constant. Equilibrium occurs when $\frac{d\mathbf{z}}{dt} \to 0$.  
3. **Digital Readout**: The equilibrium state $\mathbf{z}^*$ is decoded via a linear layer to produce task-specific outputs.  

### Physics-Aware Training Algorithm  

#### Differentiable Analog Proxy  
To train the hybrid system, we simulate analog hardware behavior using a differentiable proxy:  
$$
\mathbf{z}_{\text{proxy}} = \text{DEQ}(\mathbf{u}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{analog}}) + \boldsymbol{\epsilon},
$$  
where $\boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\text{noise}}^2)$ models hardware noise, and $\sigma_{\text{noise}}$ is calibrated to measured analog device statistics. During backpropagation, gradients flow through $\mathbf{z}_{\text{proxy}}$ to update $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{digital}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{analog}}$.  

#### Loss Function  
The training objective combines task loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$ (e.g., MSE for regression) and physics regularization:  
$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}},
$$  
where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}$ penalizes deviations from governing equations (e.g., $\|\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}\|$ for electromagnetic fields) and $\lambda$ balances terms.  

### Experimental Design  

#### Data Collection  
- **Synthetic Physics Datasets**: Generate data using partial differential equations (PDEs) for fluid dynamics, elasticity, and heat transfer.  
- **Real-World Control Tasks**: Use robotic manipulation datasets (e.g., UR5e arm trajectories) with embedded physical constraints.  

#### Baselines  
- Digital DEQs trained on GPUs.  
- Analog-aware LSTMs and CNNs from recent surveys (Datar et al., 2024).  
- Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) without analog co-design.  

#### Evaluation Metrics  
1. **Energy Efficiency**: Measured via hardware power sensors (Joules per inference).  
2. **Time-to-Compute**: Wall-clock time for equilibrium convergence.  
3. **Robustness**: Accuracy under synthetic noise injection (0–20% SNR).  
4. **Scalability**: Performance on systems with $10^3$–$10^5$ state variables.  

#### Hardware Prototyping  
Collaborate with analog hardware labs to deploy trained $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{analog}}$ on memristive crossbar arrays and photonic chips. Use FPGA-based digital co-processors for $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{digital}}$.
