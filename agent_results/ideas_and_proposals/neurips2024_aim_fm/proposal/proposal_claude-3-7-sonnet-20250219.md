# Integrating Causal Reasoning into Medical Foundation Models for Explainable Healthcare AI

## 1. Introduction

Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) have emerged as a promising approach to address critical healthcare challenges, including limited access to medical professionals, high costs, and inefficient clinical workflows. These models leverage large-scale, multimodal medical data to provide intelligent support for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment recommendations. However, the widespread adoption of MFMs in clinical settings faces significant barriers due to their "black-box" nature—healthcare professionals are reluctant to trust systems that cannot explain their reasoning, particularly in high-stakes medical decisions.

The opacity of current MFMs is particularly problematic in healthcare, where understanding the rationale behind a recommendation is as important as the recommendation itself. Clinicians need to know not just what a model predicts but why it makes that prediction to integrate AI-driven insights responsibly into their clinical decision-making. Current explainability approaches for deep learning models, such as attention maps or feature importance scores, predominantly capture correlational patterns rather than causal relationships. This limitation can lead to misleading interpretations and potentially harmful clinical decisions.

The disconnect between how MFMs make predictions and how medical professionals reason about cases represents a fundamental challenge. Medical reasoning is inherently causal—physicians think in terms of mechanisms, interventions, and counterfactuals (e.g., "What would happen if we administered this treatment?"). In contrast, most AI models, including current MFMs, operate primarily through pattern recognition, lacking an explicit representation of causal relationships.

Recent advances in causal inference and deep learning present an opportunity to address this gap. Research has begun exploring the integration of causal reasoning with foundation models (Zhang et al., 2023), with promising applications in critical care (Cheng et al., 2025) and clinical decision support (Shetty & Jordan, 2025). These developments suggest that incorporating causal structures into MFMs could significantly enhance their explainability and clinical utility.

This research aims to develop CausalMFM, a novel framework that embeds causal reasoning mechanisms within medical foundation models to provide interpretable, clinically meaningful explanations for model predictions. By aligning the model's reasoning process with medical causal thinking, CausalMFM seeks to bridge the trust gap between AI systems and healthcare professionals, ultimately improving patient outcomes through more reliable and transparent AI-assisted healthcare.

The significance of this research is threefold. First, by enhancing the explainability of MFMs through causal reasoning, it addresses a critical barrier to clinical adoption of AI in healthcare. Second, the integration of causal structures potentially improves the robustness of MFMs against dataset shifts and biases, a common challenge in healthcare applications. Third, this work contributes to the broader field of explainable AI by developing and validating methods that go beyond superficial explanations to capture meaningful causal mechanisms.

## 2. Methodology

The proposed CausalMFM framework integrates causal reasoning into medical foundation models through a comprehensive methodology comprising four main components: (1) causal discovery from multimodal medical data, (2) causal-aware model architecture, (3) counterfactual explanation generation, and (4) clinical validation. The detailed approach for each component is outlined below.

### 2.1 Causal Discovery from Multimodal Medical Data

The first step involves learning causal graphs from heterogeneous medical data, including imaging, clinical notes, laboratory results, and demographic information. We will employ a hybrid approach combining data-driven discovery with domain knowledge.

**Data Preprocessing and Integration:**
1. Multimodal data alignment: Synchronize different data modalities temporally and contextually.
2. Missing data handling: Implement multiple imputation techniques specifically designed for medical data.
3. Feature extraction: Extract relevant features from each modality using domain-specific methods.

**Causal Structure Learning:**
We will implement a two-stage causal discovery process:

1. **Constraint-based discovery:** Apply the PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm with modifications to handle mixed data types:

$$G = \text{PC-Mixed}(D, \alpha, K)$$

where $G$ is the learned causal graph, $D$ is the multimodal dataset, $\alpha$ is the significance level for conditional independence tests, and $K$ is the maximum conditioning set size.

2. **Score-based refinement:** Refine the initial structure using a score-based approach with medical domain constraints:

$$G^* = \arg\max_{G \in \mathcal{G}} \text{Score}(G, D) \text{ subject to } C_{\text{med}}(G)$$

where $\mathcal{G}$ is the space of directed acyclic graphs, $\text{Score}(G, D)$ is a scoring function (e.g., BIC or MDL), and $C_{\text{med}}(G)$ represents medical domain constraints.

**Domain Knowledge Integration:**
We will incorporate medical domain knowledge in multiple ways:
1. Structural constraints: Define forbidden and required connections based on established medical knowledge.
2. Temporal constraints: Enforce temporal precedence (e.g., symptoms cannot cause pre-existing conditions).
3. Expert validation: Engage medical professionals to review and refine learned causal structures.

### 2.2 Causal-Aware Model Architecture

We propose a novel architecture that embeds the learned causal structures into the foundation model, enabling causal reasoning during both training and inference.

**Causal Encoder Module:**
The causal encoder transforms input features in alignment with the discovered causal graph:

$$\mathbf{z}_i = f_{\text{enc}}(\mathbf{x}_i, G)$$

where $\mathbf{x}_i$ is the input feature vector, $G$ is the causal graph, and $\mathbf{z}_i$ is the causally encoded representation.

The encoding function $f_{\text{enc}}$ is implemented as a graph neural network that processes features according to their causal relationships:

$$\mathbf{h}_j^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}\mathbf{h}_j^{(l)} + \sum_{i \in \text{Pa}(j)} \mathbf{V}_{ij}^{(l)}\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}\right)$$

where $\mathbf{h}_j^{(l)}$ is the representation of node $j$ at layer $l$, $\text{Pa}(j)$ represents the parents of node $j$ in the causal graph, and $\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$, $\mathbf{V}_{ij}^{(l)}$ are learnable parameters.

**Causal Attention Mechanism:**
We extend the standard self-attention mechanism to incorporate causal structure:

$$\text{CausalAttention}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}, G) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \odot \mathbf{M}_G\right)\mathbf{V}$$

where $\mathbf{M}_G$ is a mask derived from the causal graph $G$, and $\odot$ represents element-wise multiplication.

**Structural Causal Layer:**
We introduce a Structural Causal Layer (SCL) that models explicit causal mechanisms:

$$\mathbf{y} = \sum_{i=1}^N f_i(\mathbf{Pa}(X_i)) + \epsilon_i$$

where $f_i$ are learned causal mechanisms implemented as neural networks, $\mathbf{Pa}(X_i)$ represents the parents of variable $X_i$ in the causal graph, and $\epsilon_i$ is a noise term.

### 2.3 Counterfactual Explanation Generation

To provide clinically meaningful explanations, we develop a method for generating counterfactual explanations based on the causal model.

**Counterfactual Instance Generation:**
For a given input $\mathbf{x}$ and prediction $\hat{y}$, we generate counterfactual instances by intervening on specific variables:

$$\mathbf{x}_{CF} = \text{do}(\mathbf{x}_{X_i} = \mathbf{x}'_{X_i})$$

where $\text{do}(\cdot)$ represents the do-operator from causal inference, and $\mathbf{x}'_{X_i}$ is the modified value of feature $X_i$.

The counterfactual prediction is then:

$$\hat{y}_{CF} = f_{\text{CausalMFM}}(\mathbf{x}_{CF})$$

**Minimal Sufficient Explanations:**
We identify the minimal set of features that, when changed, lead to a different prediction:

$$S^* = \arg\min_{S \subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}} |S| \text{ subject to } f_{\text{CausalMFM}}(\text{do}(\mathbf{x}_S = \mathbf{x}'_S)) \neq \hat{y}$$

**Natural Language Explanation Generation:**
We train a sequence-to-sequence model to convert counterfactual insights into natural language explanations:

$$\text{explanation} = \text{Seq2Seq}(\mathbf{x}, \hat{y}, S^*, \{\hat{y}_{CF,i}\}_{i \in S^*})$$

The explanations will follow a template that emphasizes causality, e.g., "The model predicted [diagnosis] because [feature A] indicates [mechanism], which causes [symptom B]. If [feature A] were normal, the prediction would change to [alternative diagnosis]."

### 2.4 Experimental Design and Evaluation

We will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CausalMFM on multiple medical tasks and datasets:

**Clinical Validation:**
We will conduct a validation study with healthcare professionals to assess the clinical utility of CausalMFM:

1. **Participants:** 20-30 clinicians from diverse specialties
2. **Procedure:**
   - Present cases with both traditional MFM and CausalMFM explanations
   - Collect ratings on trust, usefulness, and comprehensibility
   - Measure decision agreement and time to decision

3. **Metrics:**
   - Trust score (5-point Likert scale)
   - Decision confidence (%)
   - Decision time (seconds)
   - Explanation preference (forced choice)

**Ablation Studies:**
We will conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component:
1. CausalMFM without causal discovery (using expert-provided causal graphs)
2. CausalMFM without the counterfactual explanation generation
3. CausalMFM with different causal discovery algorithms
