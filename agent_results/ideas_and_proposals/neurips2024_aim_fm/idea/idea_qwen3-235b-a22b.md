1. **Title**: **Causal Reasoning Meets Explainable Medical Foundation Models**  

2. **Motivation**:  
Medical foundation models (MFMs) hold transformative potential for healthcare but face adoption barriers due to their "black-box" nature. Clinicians require transparent, interpretable decisions to trust AI systems, especially in high-stakes scenarios like diagnosis or treatment. Current explainability methods (e.g., attention maps) often capture correlations rather than causal relationships, leading to unreliable interpretations. Addressing this gap is critical for regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI Act) and to bridge the trust divide between AI systems and healthcare professionals, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.  

3. **Main Idea**:  
This work proposes **Causal-MFM**, a framework that integrates causal reasoning into MFMs to provide interpretable, action-aware explanations. Instead of focusing on associative patterns, we will map input features (e.g., imaging, lab results) to causal mechanisms using counterfactual analysis and causal Bayesian networks. The methodology includes:  
- **Causal Discovery**: Learning causal graphs from multimodal medical data (images, text, sensor signals) via domain-specific constraints to model interventions (e.g., "What if drug X is prescribed?").  
- **Causal Explanation Module**: Embedding explainability into the modelâ€™s architecture, generating justifications (e.g., "Abnormal liver enzymes are caused by X and justify treatment Y").  
- **Evaluation**: Collaborating with clinicians to validate clarity, faithfulness (via ablation tests), and context-specific utility on tasks like radiology report generation and EHR-based prognosis.  

Anticipated outcomes include benchmark improvements in explanation relevance (measured via clinician feedback) and robustness against covariate shifts. This approach could establish causal reasoning as a pillar for trustworthy MFMs, fostering equitable, audit-ready AI systems in healthcare.
