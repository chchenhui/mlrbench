# Uncertainty-Driven Model-Assisted Curation for Multi-Domain Foundation Models  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
The rise of large-scale foundation models has shifted the AI community’s focus from model architecture innovations to *data-centric* challenges, emphasizing data quality, diversity, and governance (Zha et al., 2023a). While tools like active learning and weak supervision have streamlined dataset curation, scaling these methods to multi-domain settings remains prohibitively expensive and prone to biases. Current model-assisted pipelines often fail to balance efficiency with domain adaptability: they either inundate annotators with redundant samples (Saveliev et al., 2025) or overlook underrepresented domains due to static prioritization strategies (Zheng et al., 2023). Additionally, dataset shifts and ethical concerns about data provenance compound these challenges (Tschalzev et al., 2024).  

### Research Objectives  
This work proposes **UMC (Uncertainty-driven Model-assisted Curation)**, a human-in-the-loop framework that optimizes dataset construction for multi-domain foundation models. Our objectives are:  
1. To develop an ensemble uncertainty quantification system that identifies *high-impact* samples (low confidence, high inter-model disagreement) for annotation.  
2. To create a dynamic resource allocation mechanism that balances exploration (new domains) and exploitation (hard samples) using multi-armed bandits.  
3. To validate UMC’s ability to reduce annotation costs by 30–50% while improving model robustness and domain coverage.  

### Significance  
UMC addresses critical gaps in data-centric AI by:  
- **Cost Efficiency**: Targeting annotation efforts on ambiguous or domain-divergent samples.  
- **Domain Adaptability**: Ensuring equitable representation of emerging domains through adaptive sampling.  
- **Ethical Governance**: Mitigating bias by prioritizing diverse data subsets.  
This approach aligns with the DataPerf/DynaBench vision of benchmark-driven curation (Zha et al., 2023b) and advances the vision of human-guided data-centric systems (Saveliev et al., 2025).

## 2. Methodology  

### Pipeline Overview  
UMC operates in four iterative stages (Figure 1):  
1. **Uncertainty Estimation**: An ensemble of pre-trained domain specialists evaluates unlabeled data.  
2. **Sample Prioritization**: Clustering identifies regions of high uncertainty/disagreement for human review.  
3. **Human Annotation**: Curators validate samples through an interactive interface with model explanations.  
4. **Model Retraining & Budget Reallocation**: The foundation model is retrained, and a bandit algorithm redistributes labeling resources.  

#### Stage 1: Ensemble Uncertainty Estimation  
Given an unlabeled pool $\mathcal{D}$, a set of pre-trained models $\{f_1, ..., f_M\}$ from diverse domains (e.g., vision, text, geospatial), we compute two scores per sample $x$:  
- **Predictive Uncertainty**: Measured via entropy:  
  $$H(y|x) = -\sum_{c=1}^C f_{\text{avg}}(y=c|x) \log f_{\text{avg}}(y=c|x),$$  
  where $f_{\text{avg}}$ is the ensemble’s mean prediction.  
- **Model Disagreement**: KL divergence between models:  
  $$D_{\text{KL}}(x) = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M D_{\text{KL}}(f_i(y|x) \Vert f_{\text{avg}}(y|x)).$$  
Samples are ranked by the combined score $S(x) = \alpha H(y|x) + (1-\alpha) D_{\text{KL}}(x)$, where $\alpha$ balances the terms.  

#### Stage 2: Clustering & Routing  
Samples with $S(x) > \tau$ (a dynamic threshold) are embedded into a low-dimensional space using UMAP. K-means clusters these embeddings to identify *diverse* uncertainty regions. Each cluster is assigned a **domain affinity score** $d_i$ based on its similarity to existing domains (using centroid distances).  

#### Stage 3: Interactive Annotation Interface  
Curators review clusters through a dashboard that:  
- Highlights samples with the highest $S(x)$ per cluster.  
- Shows per-sample model explanations (e.g., Grad-CAM for vision, attention maps for text).  
- Allows bulk labeling via customizable templates.  

#### Stage 4: Multi-Armed Bandit Allocation  
A contextual bandit dynamically allocates the annotation budget $B$ across clusters. Each cluster is treated as an “arm” with a reward function:  
$$R_i = \beta \cdot \text{Uncertainty}_i + (1-\beta) \cdot \text{DomainNovelty}_i,$$  
where $\text{DomainNovelty}_i$ measures the cluster’s deviation from existing domain distributions. The bandit uses Thompson Sampling to maximize cumulative rewards over iterations.  

#### Stage 5: Model Retraining  
The foundation model $F$ is fine-tuned on the newly labeled data $\mathcal{D}_{\text{labeled}}$ using a distillation loss:  
$$\mathcal{L} = \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}}(F(x), y) + (1-\lambda) \mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}(F(x), f_{\text{avg}}(x)),$$  
ensuring knowledge transfer from the ensemble.  

### Experimental Design  

#### Datasets  
- **Multi-Domain Benchmark**: Combines text (PubMedQA), vision (DomainNet), geospatial (EarthObservation), and tabular (OpenML-CC18) datasets.  
- **Synthetic Shifts**: Introduce controlled domain shifts (e.g., noise, style transfer) to evaluate robustness.  

#### Baselines  
1. **Active Learning**: Margin sampling (least confident).  
2. **Diversity Sampling**: Coreset selection.  
3. **Model-Agnostic**: Random sampling, DatasetCondenser.  

#### Evaluation Metrics  
1. **Annotation Efficiency**:  
   - *Annotation Efficiency Gain (AEG)*: $\frac{\text{Accuracy}_{\text{UMC}} - \text{Accuracy}_{\text{Baseline}}}{\text{\% Labeled Samples}_{\text{Baseline}} - \text{\% Labeled Samples}_{\text{UMC}}}$.  
2. **Model Performance**: Accuracy, F1-score across domains.  
3. **Domain Coverage**: Entropy-based score over domain distributions.  
4. **Robustness**: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), AUROC on out-of-distribution detection.  

#### Statistical Validation  
- ANOVA tests for significance in performance gains.  
- Ablation studies on uncertainty metrics and bandit strategies.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Technical Outcomes  
1. **Efficiency**: Reduce annotation costs by 30–50% compared to active learning baselines while matching or exceeding model performance.  
2. **Robustness**: Improve ECE by 20% on shifted data via uncertainty-aware retraining.  
3. **Coverage**: Achieve 15% higher domain entropy than diversity sampling methods.  

### Broader Impact  
1. **Data-Centric AI Advancement**: UMC’s open-source implementation will provide a reusable framework for dataset curation, complementing benchmarks like DataPerf.  
2. **Ethical AI**: By weighting domain novelty, UMC mitigates underrepresentation biases common in static pipelines.  
3. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: The interactive interface fosters collaboration between domain experts and ML practitioners, aligning with the workshop’s goal of bridging methodologies.  

### Societal Implications  
- Accelerates high-quality dataset creation for underserved domains (e.g., healthcare, climate science).  
- Promotes transparent governance through explainable uncertainty estimates and audit trails.
