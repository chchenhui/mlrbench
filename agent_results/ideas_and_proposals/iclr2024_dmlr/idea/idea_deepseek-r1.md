**Title:** *Foundation Model-Assisted Dynamic Curation for Specialized Domain Datasets*  

**Motivation:** Domain-specific applications (e.g., healthcare, climate science) face challenges in dataset curation due to fragmented, unlabeled data and evolving domain knowledge, leading to outdated or biased models. Scalable, ethical methods are needed to build and maintain high-quality datasets for robust foundation models in these critical areas.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a framework where foundation models (FMs) actively curate domain-specific datasets through iterative cycles. First, pretrained FMs (e.g., multimodal LLMs) generate probabilistic labels and metadata for uncurated domain data (e.g., medical imaging, sensor data). Next, an *active curation loop* selectively queries human experts to validate uncertain labels, prioritizing samples with high domain complexity or low model confidence. To address dataset drift, the framework integrates temporal signals (e.g., new research findings) and user feedback to trigger dataset updates. A dynamic quality metric combining semantic coherence, diversity, and ethical fairness is proposed to guide curation. Experiments on biomedical and environmental datasets will validate improvements in model generalizability and robustness compared to static datasets. The approach aims to democratize high-quality dataset creation for specialized domains while embedding governance protocols for transparency and bias mitigation.
