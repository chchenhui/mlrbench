# Mapping Latent Concept Spaces for Scalable Model Behavior Attribution

## 1. Introduction

### Background
The rapid advancement of machine learning has led to increasingly complex models with remarkable capabilities across various domains. However, as these models grow in complexity, understanding their decision-making processes becomes increasingly challenging. This opacity presents significant barriers to model improvement, safety assurance, and ethical deployment. Current interpretability approaches typically fall into two categories: mechanistic interpretability, which examines low-level neuron activations but struggles to connect these to human-understandable concepts, and concept-based interpretability, which attempts to map model behaviors to human concepts but often lacks precision in attributing these to specific model components.

The challenge of model behavior attribution—understanding how different factors in the machine learning pipeline influence outcomes—remains largely unsolved at scale. Recent work such as ConLUX (Liu et al., 2024) and ConceptDistil (Sousa et al., 2022) has made progress in concept-based explanations, but significant gaps remain in connecting these concepts to specific model components and understanding how concepts transform through model layers. Additionally, as highlighted by Ramaswamy et al. (2022), the effectiveness of concept-based explanations is heavily dependent on the choice of probe datasets and concept learnability, further complicating the attribution problem.

### Research Objectives
This research proposes a novel framework called "Latent Concept Mapping" (LCM) that bridges the gap between mechanistic and concept-based interpretability approaches. The specific objectives are to:

1. Develop an unsupervised method to identify latent concept clusters within model activations across network layers
2. Create a bidirectional mapping between these latent concepts and human-interpretable concepts
3. Track concept transformations through model architectures to attribute model behaviors to specific concept interactions
4. Design targeted intervention techniques to modify model behavior by manipulating identified concept representations
5. Validate the framework across different model architectures and domains (vision, language, multimodal)

### Significance
This research addresses a fundamental challenge in AI safety, explainability, and improvement. By providing a scalable framework for attributing model behaviors to specific concepts and their interactions within the model, we enable:

1. **Precise Attribution**: Identifying which parts of a model are responsible for specific behaviors or biases
2. **Targeted Interventions**: Enabling modifications to model behavior without complete retraining
3. **Safety Analysis**: Better understanding of how models might generalize or fail in novel situations
4. **Training Optimization**: Insights into which training data influences which concepts, allowing for more efficient data selection
5. **Bridging Human and Machine Understanding**: Creating a common language for discussing model behavior using concepts that are meaningful to humans while precisely mapped to model internals

By addressing the limitations identified in previous work and providing a comprehensive framework for concept-based attribution, this research will significantly advance our ability to understand, control, and improve complex machine learning systems.

## 2. Methodology

Our Latent Concept Mapping (LCM) methodology consists of four main components: (1) latent concept discovery, (2) concept alignment, (3) concept flow tracking, and (4) intervention techniques. Together, these create a comprehensive framework for attributing model behaviors to specific concept interactions.

### 2.1 Latent Concept Discovery

We propose an unsupervised approach to identify latent concepts within model activations without requiring pre-defined concept datasets.

**Algorithm 1: Latent Concept Discovery**
1. For a given model $M$ with $L$ layers, collect activation matrices $A^l \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D_l}$ for layer $l \in \{1,2,\ldots,L\}$ across $N$ diverse inputs, where $D_l$ is the dimensionality of layer $l$.
2. For each layer $l$, perform dimensionality reduction on $A^l$ using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to obtain $\hat{A}^l \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$ where $d \ll D_l$ captures 95% of the variance.
3. Apply hierarchical clustering with dynamic tree cutting to $\hat{A}^l$ to identify clusters $C^l = \{C^l_1, C^l_2, \ldots, C^l_{K_l}\}$, where $K_l$ is determined automatically.
4. For each cluster $C^l_k$, compute a centroid $\mu^l_k$ and derive a linear projection matrix $P^l_k$ that maps from the full activation space to the concept subspace.
5. Define the latent concept representation of input $x$ at layer $l$ for concept $k$ as:
   $$LC^l_k(x) = P^l_k \cdot A^l(x)$$

The hierarchical clustering approach allows for multi-level concept representation, capturing both fine-grained and coarse concepts. The projection matrices $P^l_k$ enable us to isolate the subspaces corresponding to each latent concept.

### 2.2 Concept Alignment

To establish a connection between latent concepts and human-interpretable concepts, we develop a bidirectional mapping approach.

**Algorithm 2: Concept Alignment**
1. Curate a concept dataset $D_C = \{(x_i, c_i)\}_{i=1}^M$ where $x_i$ are inputs and $c_i \in \{1,2,\ldots,C\}$ are concept labels from a predefined set of $C$ human-interpretable concepts.
2. For each human concept $c$ and layer $l$, collect activation vectors from inputs associated with that concept: $A^l_c = \{A^l(x) | (x,c) \in D_C\}$.
3. Calculate the alignment score between human concept $c$ and latent concept $k$ at layer $l$ as:
   $$S(c, LC^l_k) = \frac{1}{|A^l_c|} \sum_{a \in A^l_c} \cos(P^l_k \cdot a, \mu^l_k)$$
4. Construct a bipartite graph $G^l$ where edges connect human concepts to latent concepts with weights given by $S(c, LC^l_k)$.
5. Apply the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal matching between human and latent concepts.
6. For each matched pair $(c, LC^l_k)$, compute the probability of concept $c$ given an activation:
   $$P(c|A^l(x)) = \sigma(w^l_k \cdot LC^l_k(x) + b^l_k)$$
   where $w^l_k$ and $b^l_k$ are learned parameters and $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.

This alignment mechanism creates a probabilistic mapping between human concepts and latent concept representations, allowing for the interpretation of model activations in terms of human-understandable concepts.

### 2.3 Concept Flow Tracking

To understand how concepts transform through the network, we track concept flows across layers.

**Algorithm 3: Concept Flow Tracking**
1. For consecutive layers $l$ and $l+1$, calculate the influence matrix $I^{l,l+1} \in \mathbb{R}^{K_l \times K_{l+1}}$ where:
   $$I^{l,l+1}_{j,k} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim X}\left[\frac{\partial LC^{l+1}_k(x)}{\partial LC^l_j(x)}\right]$$
2. Normalize each row of $I^{l,l+1}$ to create a transition probability matrix $T^{l,l+1}$.
3. Construct a concept flow graph $F$ where nodes are latent concepts at each layer and edges represent transitions with weights from $T^{l,l+1}$.
4. For an input $x$ and target output $y$, identify the concept activation path:
   $$PATH(x,y) = \{LC^l_k | LC^l_k(x) > \tau, \exists \text{ path from } LC^l_k \text{ to output } y\}$$
   where $\tau$ is an activation threshold.

The concept flow graph $F$ enables us to trace how concepts combine and transform through the network to produce specific outputs.

### 2.4 Intervention Techniques

Based on the discovered concept mappings, we develop techniques to intervene on model behavior.

**Algorithm 4: Concept-Based Intervention**
1. For a target concept $c$ that needs intervention, identify the corresponding latent concepts $LC^l_k$ across layers.
2. For a set of inputs $X_c$ exhibiting the concept, and a set $X_{\neg c}$ not exhibiting it, compute the activation differences:
   $$\Delta A^l = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim X_c}[A^l(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{x \sim X_{\neg c}}[A^l(x)]$$
3. Project $\Delta A^l$ onto the concept subspace using $P^l_k$ to obtain the concept-specific direction:
   $$\delta^l_k = P^l_k \cdot \Delta A^l$$
4. For an input $x$ where intervention is desired, modify the activation:
   $$\hat{A}^l(x) = A^l(x) - \alpha \cdot \delta^l_k$$
   where $\alpha$ controls the intervention strength.
5. Propagate the modified activation forward through the network to generate the modified output:
   $$\hat{y} = M_{l+1:L}(\hat{A}^l(x))$$

### 2.5 Experimental Design
