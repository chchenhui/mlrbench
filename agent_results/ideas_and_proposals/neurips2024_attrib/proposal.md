**Integrated Concept Mapping Framework for Transparent Attribution in Black-Box Models**

### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Modern machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs), achieve remarkable performance across tasks but operate as "black boxes," making their decision-making processes opaque. This opacity poses risks in safety-critical applications, hindering efforts to diagnose biases, ensure compliance, or improve model architectures systematically. Two dominant approaches to interpretability—*mechanistic interpretability* (analyzing neurons/circuits) and *concept-based interpretability* (linking predictions to human-understandable concepts)—remain siloed. Mechanistic methods lack intuitive explanations, while concept-based approaches often rely on predefined or dataset-biased concepts. Bridging these paradigms is essential to attribute model behavior to controllable factors in the ML pipeline.  

**Research Objectives**  
This project aims to develop a scalable framework that:  
1. Identifies latent concepts within model layers **without** predefined concept labels.  
2. Maps these concepts to human-interpretable semantics using a curated dataset.  
3. Tracks concept transformations across model layers to explain how predictions emerge.  
4. Provides actionable insights for bias detection and targeted model interventions.  

**Significance**  
The framework will enable practitioners to:  
- Attribute model outputs to **specific combinations of concepts** and their propagation pathways.  
- Diagnose unintended biases or spurious correlations tied to concept misuse.  
- Optimize models by editing concept representations instead of retraining.  
By unifying mechanistic and concept-based interpretability, this work advances the broader goal of *model behavior attribution*, addressing the challenges identified in the literature, such as dataset dependence and human interpretability limits.

### 3. **Methodology**  
#### **3.1 Data Collection**  
- **Models**: Pretrained vision (ResNet, ViT) and language models (BERT, GPT-2).  
- **Datasets**:  
  - *Concept Datasets* (supervised): Broden (images with pixel-level concept annotations) and CUB (bird species with attributes).  
  - *Task-Specific Datasets*: ImageNet (classification), Squad (QA).  
- **Activation Extraction**: Extract layer-wise activations for a diverse set of inputs (10,000 samples per dataset).  

#### **3.2 Activation Clustering**  
1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply PCA to reduce activation dimensions per layer (e.g., 512D to 64D) for efficiency.  
2. **Unsupervised Clustering**: Use hierarchical clustering with cosine similarity to group activations into $k$ clusters per layer:  
   $$ \text{Similarity}(\mathbf{a}_i, \mathbf{a}_j) = \frac{\mathbf{a}_i \cdot \mathbf{a}_j}{||\mathbf{a}_i|| \cdot ||\mathbf{a}_j||}, $$  
   where $\mathbf{a}_i$ is the PCA-reduced activation vector of the $i$-th input. The number of clusters $k$ is automatically determined via the gap statistic.  

#### **3.3 Concept Attribution**  
1. **Probing for Concept Alignment**: Train linear classifiers to predict human-labeled concepts from cluster assignments. For layer $l$, cluster $c$, and concept $m$, fit:  
   $$ P(y_m=1 | \mathbf{h}_l) = \sigma(\mathbf{w}_m^T \mathbf{h}_l + b_m), $$  
   where $\mathbf{h}_l$ is the activation at layer $l$. Concept-cluster pairs with AUC > 0.85 are retained.  
2. **Cross-Layer Concept Tracking**: Match clusters across layers using Hungarian algorithm on centroid similarity:  
   $$ \text{Cost}(c_l, c_{l+1}) = 1 - \text{Similarity}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{c_l}, \boldsymbol{\mu}_{c_{l+1}}), $$  
   where $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{c_l}$ is the centroid of cluster $c$ at layer $l$.  

#### **3.4 Visualization Tool**  
Develop an interactive dashboard to:  
- Highlight **concept activation paths** for specific inputs (e.g., showing "stripes" activating in early layers and "zebra" in later layers).  
- Rank concepts by contribution to the final prediction using Shapley values:  
  $$ \phi_m = \sum_{S \subseteq M \setminus \{m\}} \frac{|S|! (|M| - |S| - 1)!}{|M|!} [f(S \cup \{m\}) - f(S)], $$  
  where $M$ is the set of concepts and $f$ is the model output.  

#### **3.5 Experimental Design**  
1. **Baselines**: Compare against TCAV (concept attribution), ConceptDistil (model-agnostic explanations), and LIME (local explanations).  
2. **Metrics**:  
   - *Concept Alignment*: Precision/recall of cluster-concept associations.  
   - *Faithfulness*: Difference in prediction confidence when removing top-ranked concepts.  
   - *User Study*: Time and accuracy for humans identifying biases using the tool vs. alternatives.  
3. **Case Studies**:  
   - Detect spurious correlations (e.g., "water" falsely linked to "boat" in image classifiers).  
   - Edit concept representations to mitigate biases (e.g., reduce gender stereotypes in text generation).

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. A framework that **automatically identifies concept pathways** in pretrained models with minimal human input.  
2. Quantitative evidence of improved faithfulness (>15% gain over TCAV) and interpretability (30% faster bias detection in user studies).  
3. Open-source visualization tools for concept-driven model auditing.  

**Impact**  
- **Research**: Advances the unification of mechanistic and concept-based interpretability, addressing dataset dependence and scalability.  
- **Industry**: Enables efficient model debugging, reducing reliance on costly retraining.  
- **Society**: Mitigates risks of deploying biased models in healthcare, hiring, and content moderation.

**Conclusion**  
By bridging the gap between low-level model components and human-understandable concepts, this work will provide a critical step toward transparent and attributable AI systems. The framework’s scalability ensures applicability to state-of-the-art models, fostering trust and accountability in real-world deployments.
