**Title:**  
**CoEval – A Collaborative Multi-Stakeholder Framework for Assessing Generative AI’s Societal Impact**

---

### 1. Introduction  
#### **Background**  
Generative AI systems are transforming industries by synthesizing text, images, audio, and video at unprecedented scales. Yet their societal ramifications—ranging from bias amplification to environmental costs—remain inadequately understood and inconsistently measured. While initiatives like the NeurIPS Broader Impact statement have encouraged researchers to consider negative societal consequences, evaluations of generative AI systems remain fragmented, expert-centric, and siloed. Existing frameworks often fail to incorporate diverse stakeholders or employ validated measurement practices, limiting their utility for policymaking and community-driven governance.  

#### **Research Objectives**  
This research aims to:  
1. **Develop a standardized framework (CoEval)** that integrates participatory methods with evaluation science to assess generative AI’s societal impacts.  
2. **Validate the framework** across three generative AI domains (text, image, audio) through iterative co-design, computational metrics, and stakeholder feedback.  
3. **Create an open-source toolkit** and living repository to democratize impact assessments and promote transparent, reproducible evaluations.  

#### **Significance**  
By bridging gaps between technical evaluation methods and participatory governance, CoEval will:  
- **Democratize impact assessments**, ensuring marginalized voices shape evaluations.  
- **Advance measurement science** for AI by grounding metrics in social theory and empirical validation.  
- **Accelerate policy adoption** through standardized recommendations and case studies.

### 2. Methodology  
The CoEval framework comprises three phases (Figure 1), validated through mixed-method experiments and pilot deployments.  

#### **Phase 1: Co-Design Workshops**  
**Objective**: Engage stakeholders to define context-specific impact criteria.  

1. **Stakeholder Recruitment**  
   - **Groups**: Developers, end-users (e.g., educators, artists), domain experts (e.g., ethicists), policymakers, and civil society representatives.  
   - **Sample Size**: 15–20 participants per workshop, stratified for diversity (demographic, expertise).  

2. **Structured Facilitation**  
   - Use **card-sorting exercises** to map social impact dimensions (e.g., bias, environmental costs, equity) to stakeholder priorities.  
   - Conduct **scenario simulations** (e.g., “How might a text generator exacerbate misinformation?”) to surface latent harms.  

3. **Criteria Prioritization**  
   - Apply **multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)** to rank impact dimensions. For each criterion $C_i$, compute a weighted score:  
     $$  
     S_i = \sum_{j=1}^n w_j \cdot r_{ij}  
     $$  
     where $w_j$ is the weight from stakeholder $j$, and $r_{ij}$ is the rating for criterion $i$.  

#### **Phase 2: Mixed-Methods Toolkit**  
**Objective**: Provide modular tools for data collection and analysis.  

1. **Survey Instruments**  
   - **Bias Amplification Score**: Adapting from [1], compute disparities in outputs across subgroups. For text generation, measure divergence in toxicity scores (e.g., Perspective API) by demographic proxies:  
     $$  
     \text{Bias}_{\text{amp}} = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^K \left| \text{Toxicity}(G(\mathcal{D}_k)) - \text{Toxicity}(\mathcal{D}_k) \right|  
     $$  
     where $G$ is the generative model, and $\mathcal{D}_k$ is data subset $k$ stratified by attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity).  

2. **Focus Group Scripts**  
   - Semi-structured discussions to explore emergent harms, analyzed via thematic coding.  

3. **Cost-Benefit Simulations**  
   - Monte Carlo models to estimate environmental or economic trade-offs (e.g., energy use vs. productivity gains).  

#### **Phase 3: Living Repository & Policy Templates**  
**Objective**: Standardize evaluations and disseminate resources.  
- **Repository**: Host evaluation protocols, anonymized pilot data, and benchmarking results.  
- **Policy Templates**: Modular briefs for regulators, including risk mitigation strategies and audit checklists.  

#### **Experimental Validation**  
1. **Pilot Design**  
   - Deploy CoEval in three domains:  
     - **Text**: Large language models in education.  
     - **Image**: Generative art tools in creative industries.  
     - **Audio**: Voice synthesis in healthcare counseling.  
   - **Control Groups**: Compare CoEval assessments against expert-only evaluations.  

2. **Metrics**  
   - **Process Metrics**: Stakeholder diversity, time-to-completion, inter-rater reliability (Fleiss’ κ).  
   - **Outcome Metrics**:  
     - **Impact Coverage**: Percentage of harm categories identified vs. ground truth (validated via external audits).  
     - **Policy Adoption Rate**: Number of municipalities/companies adopting CoEval-informed guidelines.  

3. **Iterative Refinement**  
   - Collect feedback via Likert-scale surveys and A/B testing of toolkit components.

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
#### **Outcomes**  
1. **Validated Framework**: CoEval protocols achieving ≥80% inter-rater reliability in harm identification.  
2. **Open-Source Toolkit**: A repository with 10+ modular evaluation tools, downloaded ≥1,000 times in Year 1.  
3. **Policy Recommendations**: Three domain-specific policy templates endorsed by ≥5 regulatory bodies.  

#### **Impact**  
- **For Researchers**: A theoretically grounded, participatory alternative to ad hoc evaluations.  
- **For Policymakers**: Actionable guidelines to incentivize equitable AI development.  
- **For Industry**: Reduced regulatory risk via standardized impact disclosures.

**Conclusion**  
CoEval reimagines AI impact assessments as a participatory, science-driven process. By synthesizing stakeholder insights with rigorous metrics, it aims to establish a new norm of transparency and accountability in generative AI development. The framework’s success will depend on sustained community engagement—a challenge this proposal addresses through open-source tooling and iterative validation. If adopted widely, CoEval could mark a paradigm shift toward AI systems that are not only more capable but also more just.
