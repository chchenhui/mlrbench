### Title: Collaborative Community-Driven Evaluation Framework for Generative AI Broader Impacts

### Motivation:
The rapid growth of generative AI systems necessitates a robust framework for assessing their broader societal impacts. Existing evaluation practices often lack standardization and community involvement, leading to incomplete and biased assessments. This research aims to address this gap by developing a collaborative, community-driven evaluation framework that ensures comprehensive and unbiased impact assessments.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research will create a Collaborative Community-Driven Evaluation Framework (CCDEF) for generative AI systems. This framework will involve a multi-disciplinary team comprising AI experts, social scientists, ethicists, and stakeholders from various sectors such as education, healthcare, and policymaking. The methodology will include:

1. **Stakeholder Mapping and Engagement**: Identify and engage key stakeholders to ensure a diverse range of perspectives.
2. **Methodological Development**: Develop a suite of evaluation metrics and methodologies that are inclusive and comprehensive.
3. **Community Collaboration**: Foster collaboration through workshops, webinars, and online forums to refine and validate the framework.
4. **Pilot Studies**: Implement the framework in real-world scenarios to test its effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
5. **Documentation and Standardization**: Create a comprehensive documentation system for the framework, including guidelines, case studies, and best practices.

Expected outcomes include a standardized evaluation framework, validated methodologies, and community-driven resources. The potential impact is significant, as it will enhance the reliability and comprehensiveness of generative AI impact assessments, leading to more informed policy decisions and improved societal outcomes.
