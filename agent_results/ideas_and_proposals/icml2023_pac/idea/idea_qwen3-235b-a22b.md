**Title:** Lazily Adapted PAC-Bayesian Bounds for Sample-Efficient Interactive Learning Under Distribution Shift  

**Motivation:** Interactive learning environments often experience gradual or abrupt distribution shifts (e.g., sensor drift, evolving user preferences), requiring models to adapt continuously. Existing PAC-Bayesian bounds, while effective for static settings, are computationally prohibitive to recompute from scratch at each interaction. This leads to inefficiencies in sample complexity and computational cost, hindering real-world deployment in resource-constrained scenarios. Developing bounds that adapt *lazily*—updating only when shifts are detected—could balance robustness and efficiency.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a PAC-Bayesian framework that dynamically updates bounds using Bayesian posterior updates instead of full retraining, conditioned on detecting shifts via statistical tests (e.g., KL divergence thresholds). For deep models, incorporate variational inference to approximate posteriors while minimizing the PAC-Bayesian bound. In active learning, prioritize querying samples that reduce the bound’s sensitivity to shift magnitude. Methodology includes deriving adaptive bounds for evolving distributions, integrating exploration-exploitation via acquisition functions, and validating on continual learning benchmarks (e.g., sensor data streams, dynamic navigation tasks). Expected outcomes are tighter bounds for shifted distributions, reduced sample complexity compared to static bounds, and scalable algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Impact includes robust deployment in robotics and healthcare, where shifts are frequent, and computational resources are limited.
