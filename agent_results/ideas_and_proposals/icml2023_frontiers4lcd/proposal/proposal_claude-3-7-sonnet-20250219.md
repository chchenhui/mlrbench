# Optimal Transport-Guided Neural ODEs for Distribution-Robust Control in Uncertain Dynamical Systems

## 1. Introduction

Autonomous systems and robots operating in real-world environments face significant challenges due to distribution shifts, model uncertainties, and environmental variability. These challenges manifest as variations in initial conditions, system parameters, or external disturbances that can significantly degrade controller performance or even lead to system failure. Traditional control approaches often struggle with these uncertainties, particularly when the underlying system dynamics are complex or nonlinear.

Recent advances in machine learning have introduced Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) as powerful tools for modeling continuous-time dynamics. Neural ODEs represent a continuous-depth learning paradigm where state evolution is modeled through learnable differential equations, offering an elegant mathematical framework for capturing complex dynamical systems. Concurrently, Optimal Transport (OT) theory has emerged as a principled approach for quantifying distances between probability distributions, providing geometric insights into the transformation of distributions over time.

The integration of these two frameworks—Neural ODEs and Optimal Transport—presents a promising approach for developing control policies that are inherently robust to distribution shifts and uncertainties. By viewing control through the lens of distribution steering rather than point-to-point trajectory tracking, we can design controllers that maintain performance across a range of operating conditions.

### Research Objectives

This research proposes to develop a novel framework, OT-RobustNODE (Optimal Transport-guided Robust Neural ODE), that leverages the synergies between Neural ODEs and Optimal Transport theory to create distribution-robust control policies. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Formulate a mathematical framework that combines Neural ODEs with Optimal Transport metrics to learn control policies that steer state distributions toward desired target distributions.
2. Develop adversarial training methods that incorporate Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) principles to enhance robustness against distribution shifts and model uncertainties.
3. Establish theoretical guarantees for the convergence, stability, and robustness properties of the proposed approach.
4. Validate the framework on challenging control tasks involving significant uncertainties, such as robotic manipulation with variable friction coefficients and supply chain optimization under stochastic demand patterns.

### Significance

This research addresses fundamental challenges at the intersection of machine learning, control theory, and dynamical systems:

- **Theoretical Advancement**: By unifying OT's geometric insights with Neural ODEs' representational power, we establish new connections between distribution dynamics and robust control.
- **Practical Impact**: The resulting framework will enable the development of control policies that maintain performance under significant uncertainties, enhancing the reliability of autonomous systems in real-world applications.
- **Generalizability**: While focusing on specific validation domains (robotics and supply chain optimization), the proposed methods will be applicable to a wide range of control problems characterized by uncertainties and distribution shifts.
- **Computational Efficiency**: Our approach aims to improve sample efficiency in policy learning, reducing the data requirements for training robust controllers.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Optimal Transport-Guided Neural ODE Framework

We formulate the control problem as learning a policy that transports an initial state distribution to a target distribution while minimizing control costs and ensuring robustness to perturbations. The core of our approach is a Neural ODE that models the evolution of system states under control:

$$\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = f_\theta(x(t), u_\phi(x(t), t), t)$$

where $x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ represents the system state at time $t$, $f_\theta$ is a neural network parameterized by $\theta$ that approximates the system dynamics, and $u_\phi$ is the control policy parameterized by $\phi$.

Given an initial state distribution $p_0(x)$ and a target distribution $p_T(x)$, our goal is to learn the parameters $\theta$ and $\phi$ such that the distribution of states at time $T$, denoted by $p_T^\theta(x)$, closely matches the target distribution $p_T(x)$ while minimizing control costs and ensuring robustness.

The loss function for this optimization problem incorporates three components:

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi) = \lambda_1 \mathcal{W}_2(p_T^\theta, p_T) + \lambda_2 \mathbb{E}_{x_0 \sim p_0} \left[ \int_0^T \|u_\phi(x(t), t)\|^2 dt \right] + \lambda_3 \mathcal{R}(\theta, \phi)$$

where:
- $\mathcal{W}_2(p_T^\theta, p_T)$ is the Wasserstein-2 distance between the predicted and target distributions
- The second term represents the expected control cost
- $\mathcal{R}(\theta, \phi)$ is a robustness term that measures the sensitivity of the policy to perturbations
- $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ are weighting coefficients

### 2.2 Wasserstein Distance Computation

Computing the Wasserstein distance between distributions is generally challenging, especially in high-dimensional spaces. We employ a dual formulation based on the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality:

$$\mathcal{W}_2(p_T^\theta, p_T) = \sup_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \left\{ \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_T^\theta}[h(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p_T}[h(y)] \right\}$$

where $\mathcal{H}$ is a class of 1-Lipschitz functions. We approximate this using a neural network critic $h_\psi$ parameterized by $\psi$, with gradient penalty regularization to enforce the Lipschitz constraint:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{critic}}(\psi) = \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p_T}[h_\psi(y)] - \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_T^\theta}[h_\psi(x)] + \lambda_{\text{gp}} \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z} \left[ (\|\nabla_z h_\psi(z)\|_2 - 1)^2 \right]$$

where $p_z$ samples points along straight lines between samples from $p_T^\theta$ and $p_T$.

### 2.3 Adversarial Training for Robustness

To enhance robustness against distribution shifts and model uncertainties, we employ adversarial training inspired by Stochastic Optimal Control principles. We introduce a learned adversarial perturbation $\delta_\xi$ parameterized by $\xi$ that aims to maximize the deviation from the target distribution:

$$\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = f_\theta(x(t), u_\phi(x(t), t), t) + \delta_\xi(x(t), t)$$

The adversarial perturbation is constrained to a bounded set $\|\delta_\xi(x, t)\| \leq \epsilon$ to model realistic disturbances. The training procedure follows a min-max optimization:

$$\min_{\theta, \phi} \max_{\xi} \mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi, \xi)$$

where:

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi, \xi) = \lambda_1 \mathcal{W}_2(p_T^{\theta,\xi}, p_T) + \lambda_2 \mathbb{E}_{x_0 \sim p_0} \left[ \int_0^T \|u_\phi(x(t), t)\|^2 dt \right] - \lambda_3 \|\delta_\xi\|^2$$

This adversarial training approach ensures that the learned control policy is robust to worst-case perturbations within the specified bounds.

### 2.4 Neural ODE Implementation with Adjoint Method

To efficiently learn the parameters of the Neural ODE and control policy, we employ the adjoint method for backpropagation through ODE solvers. This approach avoids excessive memory requirements by solving a backward ODE to compute gradients:

$$\frac{da(t)}{dt} = -a(t)^T \frac{\partial f_\theta(x(t), u_\phi(x(t), t), t)}{\partial x}$$

where $a(t)$ is the adjoint variable with terminal condition $a(T) = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x(T)}$. The gradients with respect to model parameters are then computed as:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{L}}{d\theta} = -\int_0^T a(t)^T \frac{\partial f_\theta(x(t), u_\phi(x(t), t), t)}{\partial \theta} dt$$

$$\frac{d\mathcal{L}}{d\phi} = -\int_0^T a(t)^T \frac{\partial f_\theta(x(t), u_\phi(x(t), t), t)}{\partial u} \frac{\partial u_\phi(x(t), t)}{\partial \phi} dt$$

### 2.5 Algorithmic Implementation

Our training algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the parameters $\theta$, $\phi$, $\psi$, and $\xi$ randomly.
2. **Main Training Loop**:
   a. Sample a batch of initial states $\{x_0^i\}_{i=1}^B$ from $p_0$.
   b. For each sampled initial state, solve the ODE with the current policy and adversarial perturbation to obtain terminal states $\{x_T^i\}_{i=1}^B$.
   c. Update the critic parameters $\psi$ by maximizing $\mathcal{L}_{\text{critic}}(\psi)$.
   d. Update the adversarial perturbation parameters $\xi$ by maximizing $\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi, \xi)$.
   e. Update the dynamics and policy parameters $\theta$ and $\phi$ by minimizing $\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi, \xi)$.
3. **Convergence Check**: Repeat steps 2a-2e until convergence criteria are met.

### 2.6 Experimental Design and Validation

We will validate our framework on two challenging control tasks:

#### 2.6.1 Robotic Manipulation with Variable Friction

In this experiment, we consider a robotic arm performing a pick-and-place task with objects having varying friction coefficients. The state space includes the joint angles, joint velocities, end-effector position, and object position. The friction coefficient is treated as an uncertain parameter that varies across different episodes.

**Data Collection**: We collect trajectories from a simulated environment (using MuJoCo or PyBullet) where the friction coefficient is sampled from a distribution $p(\mu)$ for each episode. The target distribution represents successful completion of the task across the range of friction coefficients.

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Success rate across different friction coefficients
- Average control effort
- Wasserstein distance between achieved and target state distributions
- Comparison with baseline methods (e.g., standard reinforcement learning, model predictive control)

#### 2.6.2 Supply Chain Optimization with Stochastic Demand

This experiment focuses on inventory management in a multi-echelon supply chain with stochastic demand patterns. The state space includes inventory levels at different nodes, pending orders, and demand forecasts. The demand follows a non-stationary stochastic process with seasonal patterns and trend shifts.

**Data Collection**: We use historical demand data augmented with synthetic variations to create a diverse set of demand scenarios. The target distribution represents optimal inventory levels that balance stockout risk and holding costs.

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Average total cost (including stockout penalties, holding costs, and transportation costs)
- Service level (percentage of demand satisfied)
- Inventory stability (variance of inventory levels)
- Robustness to demand shocks (performance under sudden demand changes)

### 2.7 Theoretical Analysis

We will establish theoretical guarantees for our approach, including:

1. **Convergence Analysis**: We will derive conditions under which the min-max optimization converges to a stable solution, leveraging results from adversarial training literature and dynamic game theory.

2. **Robustness Guarantees**: We will establish bounds on the performance degradation under distribution shifts, expressed in terms of the Wasserstein distance between the training and test distributions:

$$\mathbb{E}_{x \sim q}[c(x, u_\phi(x))] \leq \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p}[c(x, u_\phi(x))] + L \cdot \mathcal{W}_2(p, q)$$

where $c$ is the cost function, $p$ is the training distribution, $q$ is the test distribution, and $L$ is a Lipschitz constant.

3. **Sample Complexity**: We will analyze the number of samples required to achieve a specified level of accuracy in the approximation of the Wasserstein distance and overall control performance.
