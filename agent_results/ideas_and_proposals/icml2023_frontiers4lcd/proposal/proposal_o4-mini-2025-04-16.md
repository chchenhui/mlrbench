Title  
Optimal Transport-Driven Neural ODEs for Robust and Adaptive Control Policies

1. Introduction  
Background  
Modern control systems—ranging from robotic manipulators to supply-chain networks—must operate safely and reliably in the presence of model mismatch, sensor noise, and non-stationary operating conditions. Classical control theory provides rigorous stability and robustness guarantees under parametric uncertainty, but often relies on linearized models or conservative bounds that limit performance. Recent advances in machine learning, in particular Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) and optimal transport theory, open the door to rich, data-driven controllers that can both model complex nonlinear dynamics and quantify distributional shifts between desired and actual system evolutions.

Neural ODEs parametrize continuous-time dynamics  
$$\dot{x}(t) = f_\theta\bigl(x(t),u(t),t\bigr)$$  
allowing flexible end-to-end training via the adjoint sensitivity method. Optimal transport (OT) provides principled metrics—most notably the Wasserstein distances—between probability distributions of system states, yielding geometric insights into how trajectories diverge under perturbations. Integrating these tools promises control policies that actively steer entire state distributions toward target configurations while preserving robustness guarantees.

Research Objectives  
1. Develop a unified framework—OT-Neural-ODE—wherein a Neural ODE models the closed-loop dynamics under a learnable policy, and an OT-based loss guides distribution steering toward a desired terminal distribution.  
2. Incorporate Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) principles via adversarial perturbations during training, to enforce robustness against model uncertainty and unforeseen disturbances.  
3. Provide theoretical analysis on convergence and stability of the proposed framework under mild regularity assumptions.  
4. Empirically validate the approach on high-dimensional robotic manipulation tasks with variable friction and on a stylized supply-chain environment with stochastic demand, comparing against state-of-the-art baselines.

Significance  
By unifying OT’s geometric distances and Neural ODE’s continuous modeling, this research aims to transcend traditional policy learning: rather than optimizing expected returns alone, it will steer full state distributions, thus explicitly accounting for tail events and distribution shifts. The result will be controllers that are both high-performance and provably robust, advancing the frontier at the intersection of machine learning, control, and dynamical systems.

2. Methodology  
2.1 Problem Formulation  
Consider a dynamical system on $\mathbb{R}^n$ controlled by $u(t)\in\mathcal{U}\subset\mathbb{R}^m$ over a finite horizon $[0,T]$. The true dynamics are  
$$\dot{x}(t) = f_{\rm true}(x(t),u(t)) + \omega(t)$$  
with $\omega(t)$ capturing unmodeled disturbances. We approximate these dynamics by a Neural ODE  
$$\dot{x}(t) = f_\theta\bigl(x(t),u(t),t\bigr),$$  
parameterized by $\theta$, and a policy network  
$$u(t) = \pi_\phi\bigl(x(t),t\bigr),$$  
parameterized by $\phi$.

Let $\rho_t^\theta$ denote the probability distribution of states at time~$t$ under the Neural ODE flow and policy. We specify a target terminal distribution $\rho_T^*$ reflecting desired end-state configurations (e.g., grasping poses, inventory levels). We define the key objective as steering $\rho_T^\theta$ toward $\rho_T^*$ in Wasserstein-2 distance
$$W_2^2\bigl(\rho_T^\theta,\rho_T^*\bigr) = \inf_{\gamma\in\Pi(\rho_T^\theta,\rho_T^*)}\int \|x-y\|^2\,d\gamma(x,y).$$

2.2 Loss Function  
We propose the composite loss  
$$\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi) 
  = \underbrace{W_2^2\bigl(\rho_T^\theta,\rho_T^*\bigr)}_{\text{distribution steering}} 
    + \lambda \,\mathbb{E}\!\left[\int_0^T \ell\bigl(x(t),u(t)\bigr)\,dt\right] 
    + \eta\,\mathcal{R}_{\rm adv}(\theta,\phi),$$  
where  
• $\ell(x,u)$ is a stage cost (e.g., control energy $\|u\|^2$ plus state penalty),  
• $\lambda>0$ balances distribution alignment against control effort,  
• $\mathcal{R}_{\rm adv}$ is an adversarial robustness term (see Sec. 2.4), and  
• $\eta>0$ trades off robustness against nominal performance.

2.3 OT Loss Computation  
To compute $W_2^2(\rho_T^\theta,\rho_T^*)$, we draw samples $\{x_T^i\}_{i=1}^N\sim\rho_T^\theta$ by forward integration of the Neural ODE, and samples $\{y^j\}_{j=1}^M\sim\rho_T^*$. We approximate the OT map via the entropy-regularized dual formulation:  
$$W_{2,\varepsilon}^2 = \max_{\varphi,\psi} 
  \sum_{i=1}^N \varphi(x_T^i) + \sum_{j=1}^M \psi(y^j)
  - \varepsilon \sum_{i,j} \exp\Bigl(\tfrac{\varphi(x_T^i)+\psi(y^j)-\|x_T^i-y^j\|^2}{\varepsilon}\Bigr)$$  
and backpropagate through the Sinkhorn iterations to obtain gradients $\nabla_\theta W_{2,\varepsilon}^2$. Taking $\varepsilon\to0$ recovers the true Wasserstein distance.

2.4 Adversarial Robustness via Stochastic Optimal Control  
To guard against worst-case disturbances, we adopt an inner maximization over perturbations $\delta(t)$ bounded by $\|\delta(t)\|\leq\delta_{\max}$:  
$$\mathcal{R}_{\rm adv}(\theta,\phi)
  = \max_{\|\delta\|\leq\delta_{\max}}
    W_2^2\bigl(\tilde\rho_T^\theta,\rho_T^*\bigr)
    + \lambda\,\mathbb{E}\!\left[\int_0^T \ell\bigl(x(t)+\delta(t),u(t)\bigr)\,dt\right],$$  
where $\tilde\rho_T^\theta$ is the terminal distribution under perturbed dynamics  
$$\dot{x}(t) = f_\theta\bigl(x(t),u(t),t\bigr) + \delta(t).$$  
In practice, we alternate: for fixed $(\theta,\phi)$, compute perturbed trajectories by gradient‐ascent updates on $\delta$; then update $(\theta,\phi)$ via gradient‐descent on the augmented loss. This scheme aligns with distributionally robust optimization and stochastic optimal control.

2.5 Training Algorithm  
Algorithm: OT-Neural-ODE Training  
1. Initialize parameters $(\theta,\phi)$.  
2. Repeat until convergence:  
   a. Sample $N$ initial states $\{x_0^i\}$ from empirical data or environment reset.  
   b. Inner adversarial loop (for $k=1\dots K$):  
      – Generate perturbations $\{\delta_k^i(t)\}$ by ascending $\nabla_\delta\bigl[\mathcal{L}_{\rm steer}+\lambda\ell\bigr]$.  
   c. For each trajectory $i$, integrate $\dot{x}^i(t) = f_\theta(x^i(t),\pi_\phi(x^i(t),t),t) + \delta_K^i(t)$ to get final states $x_T^i$.  
   d. Sample $M$ target samples $\{y^j\}\sim\rho_T^*$.  
   e. Compute $W_{2,\varepsilon}^2(\{x_T^i\},\{y^j\})$ and stage costs.  
   f. Compute total loss $\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi)$ and gradients via adjoint sensitivity.  
   g. Update $(\theta,\phi)\leftarrow(\theta,\phi)-\alpha\,\nabla\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi)$.

2.6 Theoretical Analysis  
Under standard Lipschitz and smoothness assumptions on $f_\theta$ and $\ell$, and assuming the OT loss is $\beta$-smooth in $\theta$, one can show that the composite loss $\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi)$ admits a unique stationary point that locally minimizes distributional discrepancy and control cost. Using results from control Lyapunov‐like stability in Neural ODEs [Scagliotti & Farinelli, 2023] and DRO convergence [Blanchet et al., 2023], we derive the following guarantee:

Theorem (Sketch)  
Suppose $f_\theta$ is $L$-Lipschitz in $(x,u)$ and $\ell(x,u)$ is convex in $u$. Then gradient descent on $\mathcal{L}$ with sufficiently small step‐size converges to a local minimizer $(\theta^*,\phi^*)$ satisfying  
$$W_2\bigl(\rho_T^{\theta^*},\,\rho_T^*\bigr)\,\leq\,
   \mathcal{O}\!\bigl(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{N}}+\varepsilon^{1/2}\bigr)
   +\Delta_{\rm adv},$$  
where $\Delta_{\rm adv}$ depends on the adversarial budget $\delta_{\max}$.

2.7 Experimental Design  
Datasets and Environments  
• Robotic Manipulation: MuJoCo-based tasks (e.g., “FetchPickAndPlace”) with randomized friction coefficients and joint torque noise.  
• Supply-Chain Simulation: A multi-echelon inventory model with stochastic Poisson demand and lead times.  

Baselines  
1. Neural ODE feedback policy [Sandoval et al., 2022] with standard MSE loss on terminal state.  
2. Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DRO-RL) with Wasserstein ambiguity sets [Blanchet et al., 2023].  
3. Model-based RL with Gaussian Process dynamics.  

Evaluation Metrics  
– Terminal Distribution Error: $W_2(\rho_T,\rho_T^*)$  
– Average Return: $-\mathbb{E}\bigl[\int_0^T \ell(x(t),u(t))dt\bigr]$  
– Robustness Score: worst-case return under randomly sampled disturbances.  
– Sample Efficiency: number of trajectories to reach  a specified performance threshold.  
– Computational Overhead: wall-clock time per training epoch.  

Ablation Studies  
• Impact of adversarial budget $\delta_{\max}$.  
• Role of OT regularization weight ($\lambda$) and entropy parameter ($\varepsilon$).  
• Comparison between exact Sinkhorn vs. closed‐form linear control approximations [Scagliotti & Farinelli, 2023].

This research bridges machine learning and control theory, offering:  
• A principled way to incorporate distributional objectives into policy learning, addressing safety‐critical requirements where tail events matter.  
• Enhanced robustness to real-world uncertainties—variable friction in robots, demand surges in supply chains—beyond what expectation-based methods achieve.  
• A template for integrating other geometric machine learning tools (e.g., diffusion models, mean-field OT) with continuous dynamics for control.  

Long-Term Vision  
By unifying optimal transport, Neural ODEs, and stochastic optimal control, this work lays the groundwork for:

• Extensions to PDE-constrained control (e.g., fluid dynamics) via OT-based flows in infinite dimensions.  
• Interdisciplinary advances in reinforcement learning, geometric deep learning, and dynamical systems theory.

In sum, the proposed OT-Neural-ODE framework will push the boundary of learning-based control, delivering both theoretical rigor and practical robustness for complex dynamical systems.
