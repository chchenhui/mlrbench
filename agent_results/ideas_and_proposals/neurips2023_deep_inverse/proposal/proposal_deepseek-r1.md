### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Inverse problems—where the goal is to recover hidden parameters from observed data—are central to scientific and engineering applications such as medical imaging (e.g., MRI reconstruction), geophysical exploration, and computational photography. Traditional model-based methods (e.g., variational approaches) rely on explicit knowledge of the *forward operator* (the physical model mapping parameters to observations) and noise statistics. However, deep learning (DL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art results by training neural networks to directly invert these operators using large datasets. A critical limitation of existing DL methods is their reliance on *precise knowledge of the forward model* during training. In practice, forward models are often approximate due to calibration errors, environmental variability, or simplifications (e.g., ignoring scattering effects in ultrasound imaging). This mismatch between assumed and true physics leads to severe performance degradation, limiting the real-world reliability of DL-based solvers.

**Research Objectives**  
This to develop to develop a **meta-learning framework** for training inverse problem solvers that generalize robustly across a *distribution of forward models*. Specifically, we propose to:  
1. Design a **task-episodic training paradigm** where each task corresponds to a perturbed forward model sampled from an uncertainty distribution.  
2. Optimize a neural network to either (a) perform well *on average* across tasks or (b) *rapidly adapt* to new forward models with minimal fine-tuning.  
3. Integrate **uncertainty quantification** mechanisms to improve reliability in the presence of model mismatch.  
4. Validate the framework on inverse problems in medical imaging, seismic tomography, and scattering-based reconstruction.  

**Significance**  
Current DL solvers are brittle under model uncertainties, which limits their adoption in safety-critical domains like healthcare. By explicitly training networks to handle variations in the forward operator, this work will advance the robustness and trustworthiness of learning-based inverse problem solutions. The proposed meta-learning approach bridges the gap between data-driven flexibility and physics-based reliability, enabling deployment in scenarios where system models are imperfectly known or non-stationary.

### 3. **Methodology**  
**Research Design**  
The framework consists of three components:  
1. **Task Generation**: Define a distribution of forward models $\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{A})$ capturing uncertainties (e.g., perturbed operator parameters, unmodeled physics).  
2. **Meta-Training**: Optimize a solver network $\mathbf{f_\theta}$ using episodic training over tasks sampled from $\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{A})$.  
3. **Uncertainty-Aware Adaptation**: Integrate Bayesian or latent-variable techniques to quantify and propagate uncertainties during reconstruction.  

**Data Collection**  
- **Synthetic Datasets**: Simulate training data for diverse forward models (e.g., MRI with varying coil sensitivities, seismic imaging with heterogeneous subsurface velocity profiles).  
- **Physics-Based Perturbations**: For each task, sample $\mathbf{A}_i \sim \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{A})$ by perturbing operator parameters (e.g., CT scan geometry, acoustic attenuation coefficients) or adding unmodeled effects (e.g., non-Gaussian noise, partial voluming).  
- **Benchmarks**: Use public datasets (e.g., FastMRI, OpenFWI) and simulate test tasks with *out-of-distribution* forward models to evaluate generalization.  

**Algorithmic Framework**  
The solver $\mathbf{f_\theta}$ is trained using **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)** [Finn et al., 2017], where each episode involves:  
1. **Task Sampling**: Draw a batch of $N$ tasks $\{\mathcal{T}_i\}_{i=1}^N}$, each with a unique $\mathbf{A}_i \sim \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{A})$.  
2. **Inner Loop Adaptation**: For each task, compute adapted parameters $\theta_i'$ via one or more gradient steps on task-specific loss $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(\theta)$:  
$$
\theta_i' = \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(\theta),
$$
where $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x,y}} \left[ \|\mathbf{f_\theta}(\mathbf{y}) - \mathbf{x}\|^2 + \lambda \mathcal{R}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{A}_i) \right]$ includes a physics-based regularizer $\mathcal{R}$ (e.g., $\|\mathbf{A}_i \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\|^2$).  
3. **Meta-Optimization**: Update $\theta$ to minimize the average loss across tasks after adaptation:  
$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta - \beta \nabla_\theta \sum_{i=1}^N \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(\theta_i').
$$

**Network Architecture**  
- **Hybrid Physics-DL Design**: Integrate untrained forward model residual blocks [Guan et al., 2024] into a U-Net backbone to jointly refine $\mathbf{A}_i$ and the reconstruction.  
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Use conditional normalizing flows [Khorashadizadeh et al., 2022] to model the posterior $p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{A}_i)$, enabling Bayesian uncertainty estimates.  

**Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against:  
  - Standard supervised learning (trained on a single $\mathbf{A}$).  
  - Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) [2025].  
  - Untrained residual method [Guan et al., 2024].  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  1. **Reconstruction Quality**: PSNR, SSIM on test tasks.  
  2. **Robustness**: Performance degradation under increasing model mismatch.  
  3. **Uncertainty Calibration**: Expected calibration error (ECE) for probabilistic outputs.  
  4. **Adaptation Speed**: Few-shot fine-tuning efficiency on unseen $\mathbf{A}$.  
- **Case Studies**:  
  - **MRI Reconstruction**: Vary coil sensitivity maps and undersampling patterns.  
  - **Seismic Inversion**: Test on geological models with unobserved stratigraphic features.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Robustness**: The meta-trained solver will outperform conventional DL methods on tasks with model mismatch, maintaining high PSNR (>3 dB improvement) under 20–30% perturbations to $\mathbf{A}$.  
2. **Uncertainty-Aware Reconstructions**: The integrated normalizing flow module will yield well-calibrated uncertainty maps (ECE < 0.05) correlated with reconstruction errors.  
3. **Rapid Adaptation**: The solver will achieve 90% of peak performance on new forward models with ≤5 fine-tuning steps.  

**Impact**  
This work will provide a systematic framework for deploying DL-based inverse problem solvers in real-world settings where system models are uncertain or non-stationary. Applications include:  
- **Medical Imaging**: Reliable MRI/CT reconstruction despite patient-specific variations in scanning hardware or motion artifacts.  
- **Geophysical Exploration**: Robust subsurface mapping under heterogeneous geological conditions.  
- **Industrial Sensing**: Adaptive solutions for non-destructive testing with varying material properties.  

**Limitations & Future Work**  
- **Computational Overhead**: Meta-training requires task-specific simulations, which may be expensive. Future work will explore amortized variational inference for faster adaptation.  
- **Theoretical Guarantees**: Extend convergence analysis to non-convex meta-learning settings with perturbed operators.
