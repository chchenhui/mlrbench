# Meta-Learning Robust Inverse Problem Solvers Under Forward Model Uncertainty

## 1. Introduction

Inverse problems pervade scientific domains, from medical imaging and geophysics to astronomical observation and material science. In these problems, the goal is to recover the underlying state or parameters of a system from indirect, noisy, and often incomplete measurements. Mathematically, an inverse problem can be formulated as:

$$\mathbf{y} = \mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x}) + \mathbf{n}$$

where $\mathbf{y}$ represents the observed measurements, $\mathcal{A}$ is the forward operator that models the physics of the measurement process, $\mathbf{x}$ is the unknown true state we aim to recover, and $\mathbf{n}$ denotes measurement noise.

Deep learning approaches have made remarkable progress in solving inverse problems, yielding state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as computed tomography (CT) reconstruction, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and super-resolution. However, these approaches typically assume precise knowledge of the forward operator $\mathcal{A}$ and often make simplistic assumptions about noise characteristics (e.g., additive Gaussian noise). This assumption leads to a critical vulnerability: when deployed in real-world scenarios where the actual forward model differs from the one assumed during training – a condition known as model mismatch or forward model uncertainty – performance can degrade significantly.

Forward model uncertainty arises from various sources: calibration errors in imaging devices, simplified physical models that omit complex interactions, environmental variations affecting measurement apparatus, or even manufacturing variations in sensor arrays. Despite the prevalence of such uncertainties in practical applications, the development of inverse problem solvers robust to model mismatch remains an underexplored area, creating a significant gap between theoretical performance and practical utility.

### Research Objectives

This research aims to bridge this gap by developing a meta-learning framework for inverse problem solvers that can generalize robustly across different forward model variations. Specifically, our objectives are to:

1. Develop a meta-learning architecture that learns to solve inverse problems across a distribution of forward operators, rather than for a single fixed operator.
2. Design efficient sampling strategies to generate meaningful variations in forward models that reflect real-world uncertainties.
3. Formulate adaptive regularization techniques that balance fidelity to measurements with robustness to model variations.
4. Develop theoretical guarantees on reconstruction performance bounds under specified levels of forward model uncertainty.
5. Validate the approach on multiple inverse problem domains with different types of forward model uncertainties.

### Significance

The proposed research addresses a fundamental limitation in current learning-based inverse problem solvers. By developing methods robust to forward model uncertainty, we target the following impacts:

- **Enhanced Reliability**: Reconstruction algorithms that maintain performance when the assumed model deviates from reality, increasing trustworthiness in critical applications like medical diagnosis.
- **Reduced Calibration Requirements**: Less sensitivity to precise calibration of forward models, potentially reducing equipment maintenance costs and widening accessibility.
- **Generalization Across Devices**: Algorithms that transfer better across different devices or settings without retraining, enabling broader deployment.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Better understanding and quantification of how forward model uncertainty propagates to reconstruction uncertainty.

The work aligns with emerging interest in uncertainty-aware deep learning and trustworthy AI, with potential application across domains where inverse problems arise, including medical imaging, remote sensing, computational photography, non-destructive testing, and geophysical exploration.

## 2. Methodology

Our methodology centers on developing a meta-learning framework specifically designed to train inverse problem solvers that generalize across distributions of forward models. We describe our approach in detail below:

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

We define the inverse problem with forward model uncertainty as follows:

$$\mathbf{y} = \mathcal{A}_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) + \mathbf{n}$$

where $\mathcal{A}_{\theta}$ represents a forward operator parameterized by $\theta$, which is drawn from a distribution $p(\theta)$ representing our uncertainty about the true forward model. The goal is to recover $\mathbf{x}$ given $\mathbf{y}$ without precise knowledge of which $\mathcal{A}_{\theta}$ generated the measurements.

Traditional approaches train a reconstruction network $f_{\phi}$ with parameters $\phi$ to minimize:

$$\min_{\phi} \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim p(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{n} \sim p(\mathbf{n})} \left[ \mathcal{L}(f_{\phi}(\mathcal{A}_{\theta_0}(\mathbf{x}) + \mathbf{n}), \mathbf{x}) \right]$$

for a fixed $\theta_0$ (typically the nominal or assumed model parameters). In contrast, we propose to optimize:

$$\min_{\phi} \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim p(\mathbf{x}), \theta \sim p(\theta), \mathbf{n} \sim p(\mathbf{n})} \left[ \mathcal{L}(f_{\phi}(\mathcal{A}_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) + \mathbf{n}), \mathbf{x}) \right]$$

to make the reconstruction robust across the distribution of possible forward models.

### 2.2 Meta-Learning Framework

We propose a novel meta-learning architecture called MARISE (Meta-learning Approach for Robust Inverse Solver Estimation). The core idea is to train the network through episodes, where each episode involves a different forward model.

#### 2.2.1 Network Architecture

Our network architecture consists of three components:

1. **Base Reconstruction Network**: A U-Net style architecture $f_{\phi_{\text{base}}}$ that performs the initial reconstruction.
2. **Forward Model Encoder**: A network $g_{\phi_{\text{enc}}}$ that takes forward operator characteristics and produces a conditioning vector.
3. **Adaptation Network**: A network $h_{\phi_{\text{adapt}}}$ that adjusts the base reconstruction based on the conditioning vector.

The full reconstruction pipeline is:

$$\hat{\mathbf{x}} = h_{\phi_{\text{adapt}}}(f_{\phi_{\text{base}}}(\mathbf{y}), g_{\phi_{\text{enc}}}(c_{\theta}))$$

where $c_{\theta}$ represents available information about the forward model (which may be partial or noisy). For completely unknown forward models, we can use proxy features derived from the measurements themselves.

#### 2.2.2 Meta-Training Procedure

The meta-training procedure consists of:

1. **Outer Loop (Meta-Episodes)**:
   - Sample a batch of ground truth signals $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^{N}$
   - Sample forward model parameters $\{\theta_j\}_{j=1}^{M}$ from $p(\theta)$
   - For each combination, generate measurements $\mathbf{y}_{i,j} = \mathcal{A}_{\theta_j}(\mathbf{x}_i) + \mathbf{n}_{i,j}$

2. **Inner Loop (Task Adaptation)**:
   - For each forward model $\theta_j$:
     - Compute task-specific loss: $\mathcal{L}_j = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathcal{L}(h_{\phi_{\text{adapt}}}(f_{\phi_{\text{base}}}(\mathbf{y}_{i,j}), g_{\phi_{\text{enc}}}(c_{\theta_j})), \mathbf{x}_i)$
     - Compute adapted parameters: $\phi_j' = \phi - \alpha \nabla_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_j$

3. **Meta-Update (Generalization)**:
   - Compute meta-loss: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{meta}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^{M} \mathcal{L}_j'$ where $\mathcal{L}_j'$ is computed using $\phi_j'$
   - Update base parameters: $\phi \leftarrow \phi - \beta \nabla_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_{\text{meta}}$

This procedure encourages the model to learn parameters that can be quickly adapted to new forward models with minimal loss in performance.

### 2.3 Forward Model Uncertainty Sampling

The effectiveness of our approach depends critically on generating realistic variations in forward models. We propose three complementary strategies:

#### 2.3.1 Parametric Variation

For forward models with known parameterizations, we sample parameters from appropriate distributions. For example:

- In CT imaging: variations in scanner geometry, detector response, beam energy spectrum
- In MRI: variations in coil sensitivity patterns, magnetic field inhomogeneities
- In microscopy: variations in point spread functions, illumination patterns

Mathematically, we define a nominal parameter set $\theta_0$ and sample perturbations:

$$\theta = \theta_0 + \Delta\theta, \quad \Delta\theta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma_{\theta})$$

where $\Sigma_{\theta}$ is a covariance matrix defining the magnitude and correlation of parameter variations.

#### 2.3.2 Structural Variation

For more complex uncertainties, we introduce structural variations in the forward model:

$$\mathcal{A}_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathcal{A}_{\text{base}}(\mathbf{x}) + \mathcal{A}_{\text{perturb}}(\mathbf{x}; \theta)$$

where $\mathcal{A}_{\text{perturb}}$ represents unmodeled physics, such as nonlinearities, scattering effects, or other phenomena not captured in the base model.

#### 2.3.3 Data-Driven Variation

When analytical expressions for forward model variations are unavailable, we learn them from paired measurements:

1. Collect pairs $\{(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_i)\}$ where $\mathbf{y}_i$ is acquired using the true physical system
2. Train a variational autoencoder to model the distribution of discrepancies between predicted measurements $\mathcal{A}_{\text{base}}(\mathbf{x})$ and actual measurements $\mathbf{y}$
3. Sample from this learned distribution during training

### 2.4 Adaptive Regularization

We incorporate uncertainty-aware regularization that adjusts based on the confidence in the forward model:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{data}}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}, \mathbf{y}; \theta) + \lambda(\theta) \mathcal{L}_{\text{prior}}(\hat{\mathbf{x}})$$

where $\lambda(\theta)$ is a learned function that increases regularization strength when forward model uncertainty is high. The prior loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{prior}}$ can take multiple forms:

1. **Diffusion Prior**: We leverage pre-trained diffusion models as priors by incorporating a score-matching term:
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{prior}}^{\text{diff}}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}) = \|\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p(\hat{\mathbf{x}}) - s_{\omega}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}, t)\|_2^2$$
   where $s_{\omega}$ is the score network from the diffusion model.

2. **Consistency Regularization**: We enforce consistency across different forward model variations:
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{prior}}^{\text{cons}}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}) = \mathbb{E}_{\theta_i, \theta_j \sim p(\theta)} \|\mathcal{A}_{\theta_i}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}) - \mathcal{A}_{\theta_j}(\hat{\mathbf{x}})\|_2^2$$

### 2.5 Experimental Validation

We will validate our approach on three challenging inverse problems:

#### 2.5.1 CT Reconstruction with Geometric Uncertainty

- Dataset: CT scans from the AAPM Low Dose CT Grand Challenge
- Forward model variations: ±2° in detector angles, ±5mm in source-detector distance
- Noise model: Poisson noise with varying intensities
- Baseline comparisons: FBP, U-Net, ADMM, Plug-and-Play methods

#### 2.5.2 MRI Reconstruction with Field Inhomogeneity

We simulate MRI with B0 field inhomogeneity:
- Dataset: FastMRI knee dataset
- Forward model variations: Random B0 field maps causing frequency shifts
- Acceleration factors: 4x and 8x undersampling
- Baseline comparisons: Compressed sensing, Deep learning methods like LINDL, E2E-VarNet

#### 2.5.3 Super-Resolution with Unknown Blur Kernels

We simulate super-resolution with unknown degradation processes:
- Dataset: DIV2K
- Forward model variations: Different blur kernels (Gaussian, motion, defocus) with varying parameters
- Downsampling factors: 2x, 4x
- Baseline comparisons: SRCNN, EDSR, RCAN, kernel-prediction methods

For each experiment, we will evaluate using:
1. **Reconstruction Quality**: PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS
2. **Robustness Metrics**: Performance degradation as a function of forward model deviation
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Calibration of predicted uncertainty vs. actual error
