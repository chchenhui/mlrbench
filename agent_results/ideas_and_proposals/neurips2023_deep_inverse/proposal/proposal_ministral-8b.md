# Meta-Learning Robust Solvers for Inverse Problems with Forward Model Uncertainty

## 1. Introduction

Inverse problems are fundamental to various scientific and engineering disciplines, including medical imaging, geophysics, and computational photography. Traditional methods often rely on precise knowledge of the forward model, which can be challenging to obtain in real-world scenarios. The advent of deep learning has offered promising solutions, but these methods frequently suffer from performance degradation when the assumed forward model deviates from the true underlying physics. This research aims to develop robust solvers for inverse problems that can generalize across a distribution of forward models, enhancing reliability and practical deployment.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. To propose a meta-learning framework that enables inverse problem solvers to generalize across a distribution of forward models.
2. To evaluate the effectiveness of this framework in improving reconstruction accuracy and stability in the presence of model uncertainties.
3. To demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method in real-world applications where forward model uncertainty is prevalent.

### Significance

The development of robust inverse problem solvers is crucial for advancing scientific discovery and technological innovation. By enhancing the reliability of inverse problem solvers, this research has the potential to improve the accuracy of medical imaging, optimize resource extraction in geophysics, and advance computational photography. Furthermore, the proposed meta-learning approach can serve as a generalizable framework for addressing model uncertainties in various machine learning applications beyond inverse problems.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Meta-Learning Framework

The proposed meta-learning framework aims to train inverse problem solvers that can adapt to a distribution of forward models. Instead of training on a single, fixed forward operator, the network will be optimized using episodes where each episode involves a slightly perturbed or different forward model sampled from a predefined uncertainty distribution. The meta-objective will encourage the network to rapidly adapt or perform well on average across these sampled models.

#### 2.1.1 Data Collection

The dataset for training the meta-learning model will consist of pairs of input data and forward models. The input data will represent the measurements or observations obtained from the inverse problem, while the forward models will represent the systems that generate these observations. The forward models will be perturbed or varied according to a predefined uncertainty distribution to simulate real-world scenarios where the exact forward model is unknown.

#### 2.1.2 Algorithmic Steps

1. **Episode Generation**: For each episode, a forward model is sampled from the uncertainty distribution. The input data and the corresponding ground truth are also sampled.
2. **Model Training**: The inverse problem solver is trained on the sampled forward model and input data. The objective is to minimize the reconstruction error while encouraging adaptability to the sampled forward model.
3. **Meta-Learning**: The meta-learning algorithm optimizes the inverse problem solver to perform well on average across the distribution of sampled forward models. This is achieved by minimizing the meta-objective, which measures the average performance of the solver across different forward models.

#### 2.1.3 Mathematical Formulation

Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the distribution of forward models, and let $\mathcal{D}$ be the distribution of input data. For each episode, a forward model $\mathcal{F}_i$ and input data $\mathcal{D}_i$ are sampled. The inverse problem solver $\theta$ is trained to minimize the reconstruction error $L(\theta, \mathcal{F}_i, \mathcal{D}_i)$ while encouraging adaptability to the sampled forward model. The meta-objective $J(\theta)$ is defined as the average performance of the solver across the distribution of sampled forward models:

$$J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{D}} \left[ L(\theta, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{D}) \right]$$

The meta-learning algorithm optimizes $\theta$ with respect to $J(\theta)$ to find the best inverse problem solver that generalizes well across the distribution of forward models.

### 2.2 Experimental Design

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed meta-learning framework, we will conduct experiments on various inverse problem datasets. The datasets will include real-world scenarios where forward model uncertainty is prevalent, such as medical imaging, geophysics, and computational photography. The performance of the proposed method will be compared with traditional inverse problem solvers that do not consider forward model uncertainty.

#### 2.2.1 Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the inverse problem solvers will be evaluated using the following metrics:
1. **Reconstruction Error**: The mean squared error (MSE) between the reconstructed data and the ground truth.
2. **Stability**: The standard deviation of the reconstruction error across different forward models.
3. **Computational Efficiency**: The time taken to train the inverse problem solver and perform reconstruction.

#### 2.2.2 Baseline Methods

The following baseline methods will be used for comparison:
1. **Traditional Inverse Problem Solvers**: Methods that do not consider forward model uncertainty, such as Tikhonov regularization and conjugate gradient descent.
2. **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**: Methods that incorporate physical laws into neural networks to enhance robustness to model uncertainties.
