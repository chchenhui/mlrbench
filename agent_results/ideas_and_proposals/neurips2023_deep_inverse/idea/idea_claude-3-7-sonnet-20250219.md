# Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Models for Partial Forward Operators in Inverse Problems

## Motivation
Current deep learning solutions for inverse problems typically require complete knowledge of the forward operator and assume simplified noise models. However, in real-world scenarios like medical imaging or remote sensing, we often have only partial information about the forward model due to measurement limitations, calibration errors, or unknown physical parameters. This gap severely limits the applicability of otherwise powerful methods like diffusion models, which have shown remarkable performance as priors when the forward process is fully known.

## Main Idea
We propose to develop diffusion models that explicitly incorporate uncertainty in the forward operator. Our approach introduces a novel sampling strategy that jointly samples from both the solution space and a distribution over plausible forward operators, conditioned on available measurements. By representing the forward operator as a parameterized probability distribution and integrating it into the diffusion sampling process, our method can maintain multiple hypotheses about the system model while generating consistent reconstructions. We will design a hierarchical variational inference framework that iteratively refines estimates of both the inverse solution and the forward model parameters. This approach will be particularly valuable in applications such as under-calibrated MRI reconstruction and seismic imaging where physical model parameters are partially unknown, enabling robust reconstruction even when the measurement process is incompletely specified.
