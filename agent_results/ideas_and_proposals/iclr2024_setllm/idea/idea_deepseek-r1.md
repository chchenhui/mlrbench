**Title:** Adversarial Defense in Latent Space: Robust Embedding Alignment for Large Language Models  

**Motivation:** Adversarial attacks on LLMs, which manipulate token embeddings to induce harmful outputs, pose a critical threat to model reliability. Traditional defenses often focus on input text perturbations, leaving latent-space attacks—more stealthy and challenging to detect—largely unaddressed. This research aims to close this gap by fortifying LLMs against embedding-level adversarial manipulations.  

**Main Idea:** This project proposes a defense framework that detects and mitigates adversarial perturbations within the embedding space of LLMs. The methodology involves: (1) Training a lightweight **perturbation detector** using contrastive learning to differentiate between clean and adversarially altered embeddings; (2) Integrating a **robust alignment layer** that maps embeddings to a stabilized space via adversarial training, minimizing the effect of perturbations; and (3) Employing **dynamic gradient regularization** during inference to suppress adversarial gradients. The approach will be evaluated on benchmark datasets under state-of-the-art embedding attacks (e.g., HotFlip, TextFooler variants), measuring robustness (attack success rate reduction) and computational overhead. Expected outcomes include improved resilience against latent-space attacks with minimal inference latency. If successful, this work would provide a scalable defense mechanism, enhancing trust in LLMs for high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance.
