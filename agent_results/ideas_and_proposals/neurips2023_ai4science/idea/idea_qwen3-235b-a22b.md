1. **Title**: Multiscale Neural Operators for Efficient and Accurate Large-Scale Dynamical System Simulation  
2. **Motivation**: Simulating systems with millions of interacting units (e.g., stars, particles, cells) is critical in physics, astrophysics, and biophysics but computationally prohibitive. Existing ML methods often struggle with scalability and physical fidelity, limiting their application to real-world problems like galaxy formation modeling or long-timescale biomolecular dynamics.  
3. **Main Idea**: Combine hierarchical multiscale neural operators (e.g., Fourier/Graph Neural Operators) with adaptive spatio-temporal attention to learn both global/long-range interactions and localized dynamics. The approach integrates physical constraints (e.g., conservation laws) via physics-informed loss functions and uses active learning to prioritize computationally intensive regions (e.g., turbulence, phase transitions). A hybrid architecture will separate coarse-grained global dynamics from fine-grained local interactions, enabling scalable and energy-conserving simulations. Expected outcomes include 10-100x speedups over traditional solvers while maintaining <1% error in critical metrics. This could enable real-time study of grand challenges in cosmological simulations, fusion plasmas, and lab-on-chip design, opening new avenues for predictive science.
