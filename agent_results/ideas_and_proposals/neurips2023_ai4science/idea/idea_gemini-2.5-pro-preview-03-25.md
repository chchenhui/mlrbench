**Title:** Physics-Constrained Neural Operators for Accelerating Dynamical System Solvers

**Motivation:** Simulating complex dynamical systems (e.g., fluid dynamics, cosmology) is computationally prohibitive, hindering scientific discovery. While neural operators (like FNO) show promise in learning solution operators for PDEs, they often lack physical consistency and struggle with long-term predictions or out-of-distribution scenarios inherent in scientific exploration.

**Main Idea:** We propose integrating known physical constraints (e.g., conservation laws, symmetries, boundary conditions) directly into the architecture and training process of neural operators. This involves designing operator layers that intrinsically respect certain physical principles (e.g., divergence-free fields for incompressible flow) and incorporating physics-based regularization terms in the loss function derived from the governing equations or known invariants. The expected outcome is a hybrid model that retains the speed of neural operators while significantly improving physical fidelity, accuracy, and generalization capabilities compared to purely data-driven approaches, thereby drastically accelerating computationally intensive scientific simulations.
