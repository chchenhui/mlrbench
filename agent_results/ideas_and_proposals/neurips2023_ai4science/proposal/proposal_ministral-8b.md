**Title:** Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for De Novo Molecular Generation

## 2. Introduction

### Background

For centuries, the discovery of new molecules and drugs has been a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Traditional methods often produce chemically valid but physically implausible candidates, leading to high attrition rates in drug discovery. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has shown great promise in accelerating this process. However, existing AI models often neglect physical stability and dynamic behavior, wasting resources on synthesizing non-viable molecules. To bridge this gap, this research proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates physics-based validation into generative AI.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a reinforcement learning framework for de novo molecular generation that integrates physics-based validation. The specific objectives include:

1. Designing an RL agent that interacts with a molecular dynamics (MD) simulator to evaluate candidate molecules for stability, binding affinity, and free-energy landscapes.
2. Developing a lightweight MD surrogate model for rapid feedback and efficient evaluation of molecular candidates.
3. Implementing an adaptive reward balancing mechanism that takes into account both chemical and physical properties of generated molecules.
4. Evaluating the performance of the proposed framework in terms of synthesizability, stability, and reduction in simulation-driven experimental cycles.

### Significance

The integration of physics-based validation into generative AI has the potential to significantly accelerate the drug discovery pipeline. By ensuring that generated molecules are both chemically and physically optimized, this approach can reduce attrition rates, lower the cost of drug development, and expedite the hit-to-lead stages. Furthermore, this research contributes to the broader goal of fostering AI models grounded in physical reality, which can have implications for various scientific disciplines.

## 3. Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed research follows a hybrid approach that combines reinforcement learning with physics-informed molecular dynamics simulations. The overall system consists of three main components: a molecular generator, a molecular dynamics simulator, and a reinforcement learning agent.

### Data Collection

The dataset for this research will include a diverse set of molecular structures and their corresponding physical properties. The dataset will be sourced from public databases such as PubChem, ZINC, and ChEMBL. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations will be performed using tools like GROMACS and AMBER to generate the physical properties of the molecules.

### Algorithm Design

#### Molecular Generator

The molecular generator will be implemented as a graph-based neural network (GBNN). GBNNs are well-suited for molecular generation tasks due to their ability to handle the complex connectivity and structure of molecular graphs. The generator will take as input a set of molecular features and produce a candidate molecule as output.

#### Molecular Dynamics Simulator

The molecular dynamics simulator will be used to evaluate the physical properties of the generated molecules. The simulator will perform MD simulations to assess stability, binding affinity, and free-energy landscapes. To enhance computational efficiency, a lightweight surrogate model will be developed to provide rapid feedback during the RL process.

#### Reinforcement Learning Agent

The RL agent will interact with the molecular generator and the MD simulator. The agent will receive rewards based on the physical and chemical properties of the generated molecules. The reward function will be designed to balance exploration and exploitation, encouraging the generation of diverse and stable molecules.

### Mathematical Formulation

#### Reward Function

The reward function \( R \) will be a weighted sum of chemical and physical properties:

\[ R = w_c \cdot R_c + w_p \cdot R_p \]

where \( R_c \) is the chemical reward, \( R_p \) is the physical reward, and \( w_c \) and \( w_p \) are the respective weights. The chemical reward \( R_c \) will be based on properties such as solubility, toxicity, and molecular weight, while the physical reward \( R_p \) will be based on stability, binding affinity, and free-energy landscapes.

#### Surrogate Model for MD Simulations

To reduce computational overhead, a surrogate model \( S \) will be developed to approximate the MD simulations. The surrogate model will be trained using a dataset of molecular structures and their corresponding physical properties:

\[ S(x) \approx \hat{y} \]

where \( x \) is the molecular structure and \( \hat{y} \) is the predicted physical property.

### Experimental Design

To validate the proposed method, a series of experiments will be conducted. The experiments will be divided into three phases:

1. **Baseline Experiments**: Traditional de novo molecular generation methods will be evaluated using a set of benchmark datasets to establish a baseline performance.
2. **Physics-Informed RL Experiments**: The proposed RL framework will be trained and evaluated using the same benchmark datasets. The performance will be compared with the baseline methods in terms of synthesizability, stability, and reduction in simulation-driven experimental cycles.
3. **Real-World Drug Discovery Experiments**: The proposed method will be applied to real-world drug discovery datasets to assess its practical utility and potential impact on the drug discovery pipeline.

### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the proposed method will be evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Synthesizability**: The proportion of generated molecules that can be synthesized in the laboratory.
2. **Stability**: The proportion of generated molecules that exhibit stable physical properties.
3. **Reduction in Experimental Cycles**: The percentage reduction in simulation-driven experimental cycles compared to traditional methods.
4. **Chemical and Physical Diversity**: The diversity of generated molecules in terms of chemical and physical properties.
