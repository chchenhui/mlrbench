Title: SynthTab â€“ LLM-Driven Synthetic Tabular Data with Constraint-Aware Generation  

Motivation: Many real-world tabular ML tasks face data scarcity or privacy restrictions, yet synthetic data methods often produce unrealistic or invalid samples by ignoring schema constraints and domain semantics. A practical pipeline that enforces integrity, preserves statistical properties, and respects privacy could unlock better data augmentation and safer data sharing.  

Main Idea: We introduce SynthTab, a multi-agent framework combining a fine-tuned LLM with schema-aware validation and privacy mechanisms to generate high-fidelity synthetic tables. Given a target schema and column statistics, the LLM uses retrieval-augmented prompts to propose candidate rows that reflect real distributions and domain vocabularies. A downstream Schema Validator agent enforces data types, uniqueness, referential integrity, and business rules via chain-of-thought verification. A Quality Assessor measures similarity to original data and downstream model performance, feeding corrective signals back to the LLM in iterative refines. Finally, differential privacy techniques bound information leakage. SynthTab produces realistic, constraint-compliant synthetic datasets that boost model training in low-data regimes, facilitate safe data sharing, and support domain-specific applications.
