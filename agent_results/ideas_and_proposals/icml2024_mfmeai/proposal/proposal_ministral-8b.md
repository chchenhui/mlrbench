## 1. Title

Hierarchical Multi-Modal Controller for Embodied Agents

## 2. Introduction

### Background

In recent years, multi-modal foundation models (MFM) such as CLIP, ImageBind, DALLÂ·E 3, GPT-4V, and Gemini have emerged as powerful tools in AI, enabling rich semantic understanding across various modalities. These models have shown significant potential in empowering embodied AI agents, which can perceive and interact with the environment using multiple sensory inputs. However, translating high-level semantic insights into precise low-level actions remains a significant challenge. Embodied agents need to bridge the gap between high-level decision-making and low-level control to navigate complex, open-ended environments effectively.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a hierarchical multi-modal controller for embodied agents that integrates a frozen multi-modal foundation model (MFM) with a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) controller. The proposed framework aims to:

1. **Enhance Sample Efficiency**: Improve the sample efficiency of the learning process by leveraging self-supervised exploration in a photorealistic simulator.
2. **Generalize to Novel Tasks**: Enable the agent to generalize learned skills to novel tasks and environments.
3. **Balance Semantics and Control**: Effectively translate high-level semantic insights into low-level actions, balancing the agent's decision-making prowess with nuanced control requirements.
4. **Improve Real-World Transferability**: Facilitate the transfer of learned policies from simulated environments to real-world settings.

### Significance

The development of a hierarchical multi-modal controller for embodied agents has the potential to significantly advance the field of embodied AI. By integrating a frozen MFM with a hierarchical reinforcement learning controller, the proposed framework addresses the key challenges of bridging high-level semantics and low-level control, improving sample efficiency, and enhancing generalization to novel tasks. Furthermore, the ability to transfer learned policies to real-world settings will enable the deployment of adaptable, robust embodied agents in practical applications.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Research Design

The proposed research design involves developing a two-tiered architecture for the hierarchical multi-modal controller. The top tier consists of a frozen multi-modal foundation model (MFM) that takes raw sensor streams (RGB, depth, audio) as inputs and outputs semantic affordance maps and goal representations. The bottom tier comprises a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) controller, which includes:

1. **High-Level Policy**: Ingests the outputs from the MFM to select subgoals (e.g., "pick up the red cup").
2. **Low-Level Controllers**: Specialized motion primitives (e.g., grasping, navigation) trained via imitation learning and on-policy reinforcement learning.

### 3.2 Data Collection

Data collection will involve generating synthetic sensor streams in a photorealistic simulator. The simulator will be designed to mimic real-world environments, including diverse objects, textures, and lighting conditions. The synthetic data will be annotated with pseudo-instructions and affordances generated by the MFM, which will serve as the ground truth for training the HRL controller.

### 3.3 Algorithmic Steps

#### 3.3.1 Multi-Modal Foundation Model (MFM)

The MFM will be a pre-trained model, such as CLIP or GPT-4V, that has been frozen during training. The MFM will take raw sensor streams as inputs and output semantic affordance maps and goal representations. The output of the MFM will be used to guide the high-level policy in the HRL controller.

#### 3.3.2 Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) Controller

The HRL controller will consist of two levels: the high-level policy and the low-level controllers.

**High-Level Policy**:
- **Input**: The outputs from the MFM (semantic affordance maps and goal representations).
- **Output**: Subgoals that guide the low-level controllers.
- **Training**: The high-level policy will be trained using on-policy reinforcement learning, where the agent interacts with the environment and receives rewards based on the success of the subgoals.

**Low-Level Controllers**:
- **Input**: The subgoals from the high-level policy.
- **Output**: Low-level actions (e.g., grasping, navigation).
- **Training**: The low-level controllers will be trained using imitation learning and on-policy reinforcement learning. Imitation learning will be used to train the controllers to mimic expert demonstrations, while on-policy reinforcement learning will be used to fine-tune the controllers in the simulated environment.

### 3.4 Experimental Design

The experimental design will involve training the hierarchical multi-modal controller in a photorealistic simulator and evaluating its performance in various scenarios. The evaluation metrics will include:

- **Sample Efficiency**: Measured by the number of samples required to achieve a certain level of performance.
- **Generalization**: Evaluated by testing the agent's ability to generalize learned skills to novel tasks and environments.
- **Real-World Transferability**: Assessed by transferring the learned policies to real-world settings and evaluating the agent's performance.

### 3.5 Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation metrics will include:

- **Success Rate**: The proportion of trials in which the agent successfully completes the task.
- **Sample Efficiency**: The number of samples required to achieve a certain level of performance.
- **Generalization Score**: A measure of the agent's ability to generalize learned skills to novel tasks and environments.
- **Real-World Transferability Score**: A measure of the agent's performance in real-world settings.
