## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **HiMAC: Hierarchical Multi-Modal Agent Controller Integrating Foundation Models and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Robust Embodied Agent Control**

**2. Introduction**

*   **Background:**
    The landscape of artificial intelligence is undergoing a significant transformation driven by the advent of powerful Multi-modal Foundation Models (MFMs) like GPT-4V, CLIP, ImageBind, and their open-source counterparts (LLaVA, OpenFlamingo) [2, PaLM-E]. These models demonstrate exceptional capabilities in understanding and reasoning about information across various modalities (text, image, audio, etc.), pushing the boundaries beyond traditional computer vision and NLP tasks. Concurrently, the field of Embodied AI, which aims to develop intelligent agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within physical or simulated environments, represents a frontier for AI application.

    The intersection of MFM and Embodied AI (MFM-EAI) presents a compelling research direction [Task Overview]. MFMs offer the potential to endow embodied agents with sophisticated high-level semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, enabling them to interpret complex scenes and instructions. However, a critical challenge remains: bridging the gap between the abstract, high-level understanding provided by MFMs and the precise, low-level motor control required for agents to interact effectively and safely within dynamic, open-ended environments [Challenge 1]. While models like PaLM-E [2] have shown promise in integrating sensor data into language models for tasks like manipulation planning, the translation of this integrated understanding into fine-grained, adaptive actions in partially observable, complex 3D worlds requires further investigation. Existing methods often struggle with sample efficiency [Challenge 2] and generalizing learned skills to novel situations [Challenge 3], particularly when dealing with sparse rewards and intricate physical interactions.

    Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) offers a promising paradigm for managing complexity in control tasks. By decomposing tasks into sub-tasks or skills organized hierarchically, HRL can improve sample efficiency, facilitate exploration, and enable better generalization [1, H2O2; 3, Gehring et al.; 4, HIDIO]. HRL frameworks naturally lend themselves to incorporating high-level guidance, making them suitable candidates for integration with the semantic reasoning capabilities of MFMs.

*   **Research Objectives:**
    This research aims to develop and evaluate a novel hierarchical control architecture, **HiMAC (Hierarchical Multi-Modal Agent Controller)**, that effectively integrates the strengths of pre-trained MFMs for high-level semantic understanding with the structured learning capabilities of HRL for low-level control. Our primary objectives are:
    1.  **Develop a Two-Tier Hierarchical Architecture:** Design and implement a system comprising a frozen MFM providing semantic context and goal representations, and an HRL framework with a high-level policy selecting subgoals/skills and low-level policies executing primitive actions.
    2.  **Integrate MFM Outputs into HRL:** Investigate effective mechanisms for the high-level HRL policy to utilize MFM-derived outputs (e.g., semantic segmentation, object affordances, goal embeddings) for subgoal selection and planning.
    3.  **Enhance Sample Efficiency and Generalization:** Leverage the MFM's pre-trained knowledge and the HRL structure to improve learning speed and the agent's ability to adapt to novel tasks and environmental variations compared to non-hierarchical or non-MFM-guided approaches. We will particularly explore self-supervised bootstrapping using MFM-generated pseudo-instructions and affordance maps.
    4.  **Systematic Evaluation in Simulation:** Rigorously evaluate the proposed HiMAC framework on complex, interactive tasks (e.g., navigation, object manipulation, rearrangement) within a high-fidelity 3D simulator (e.g., Habitat, AI2-THOR).
    5.  **Address Key MFM-EAI Challenges:** Specifically target the challenges of bridging high-level semantics and low-level control, improving sample efficiency, enhancing generalization, integrating multimodal inputs effectively [Challenge 4], and laying the groundwork for real-world transferability [Challenge 5].

*   **Significance:**
    This research directly addresses critical open questions identified in the MFM-EAI workshop description, particularly concerning effective system architectures, augmenting agent perception and decision-making, and balancing high-level reasoning with low-level control. By proposing a structured approach that explicitly decouples semantic understanding (MFM) from hierarchical action execution (HRL), HiMAC aims to create more capable, adaptable, and sample-efficient embodied agents. Success in this research would represent a significant step towards robots that can understand complex instructions and environments and act competently within them, with potential applications in assistive robotics, logistics, and automated exploration. Furthermore, this work will contribute valuable insights into the synergistic potential of combining large pre-trained models with structured reinforcement learning for complex control problems.

**3. Methodology**

*   **Overall Architecture:**
    The proposed HiMAC architecture features two main components operating hierarchically: a top-tier frozen Multi-modal Foundation Model (MFM) and a bottom-tier Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) controller.

    1.  **Top Tier: Frozen Multi-modal Foundation Model (MFM):**
        *   *Input:* Raw sensor streams from the agent, including RGB images ($I_t$), depth maps ($D_t$), and potentially audio signals ($A_t$) at timestep $t$. Optionally, a high-level task instruction in natural language ($L_{task}$) can be provided.
        *   *Model:* We will leverage a powerful, pre-trained, and *frozen* MFM (e.g., variants based on CLIP, LLaVA, or OpenFlamingo). Keeping the MFM frozen capitalizes on its extensive pre-training, avoids catastrophic forgetting, and significantly reduces the training burden for the embodied agent specific components.
        *   *Processing:* The MFM processes the multimodal inputs to extract rich semantic information about the environment.
        *   *Output:* The MFM generates structured representations relevant for downstream control, such as:
            *   **Semantic Maps/Features ($S_t$):** Dense or sparse feature maps highlighting object locations, categories, and potentially states (e.g., open/closed).
            *   **Affordance Maps ($\mathcal{A}_t$):** Maps indicating possible interactions with objects (e.g., graspable, navigable, openable). These can be derived implicitly from MFM features or explicitly predicted if the MFM is fine-tuned (though we initially propose frozen).
            *   **Goal Representations ($G_t$):** Embeddings or symbolic representations corresponding to the current high-level task ($L_{task}$) or dynamically identified subgoals.
            *   **(Optional) Pseudo-Instructions ($\hat{L}_{subtask}$):** During self-supervised training phases, the MFM can analyze the scene and generate plausible sub-task instructions (e.g., "Pick up the red block on the table").

    2.  **Bottom Tier: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) Controller:**
        This tier consists of a high-level policy ($\pi_h$) and a set of low-level skill policies ($\{\pi_l^k\}$).
        *   **High-Level Policy ($\pi_h$):**
            *   *Input:* The agent's current state ($s_t^h$, potentially including pose, coarse map) and the structured semantic outputs from the MFM ($S_t, \mathcal{A}_t, G_t$).
            *   *Action Space:* Selects among a discrete set of available low-level skills/options or subgoals (e.g., `NavigateTo(Object)`, `Grasp(Object)`, `PlaceAt(Location)`). The action is denoted as $g_t$ or index $k$.
            *   *Objective:* Learns to sequence skills effectively to accomplish the high-level task ($L_{task}$). Maximize the expected discounted sum of extrinsic task rewards $r_t^{ext}$ received upon task completion or significant progress.
            $$ J(\pi_h) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_h} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma_h^t r_t^{ext} \right] $$
            where $\tau$ is a sequence of high-level states and actions, and $\gamma_h$ is the discount factor.
            *   *Algorithm:* We will employ an off-policy RL algorithm like Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) or an on-policy algorithm like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), adapted for the hierarchical setting. We may draw inspiration from methods like H2O2 [1] for option management or HIDIO [4] for intrinsic motivation if explicit option discovery is pursued.
        *   **Low-Level Skill Policies ($\{\pi_l^k\}$):**
            *   *Input:* The selected subgoal/skill command $g_t$ from $\pi_h$, and the agent's low-level state ($s_t^l$, including proprioceptive information like joint angles, detailed local sensor readings like immediate depth/RGB).
            *   *Action Space:* Primitive actions available to the agent (e.g., joint torques, velocity commands `[vx, vy, vz, wx, wy, wz]`). Action $a_t \sim \pi_l^k(\cdot | s_t^l, g_t)$.
            *   *Objective:* Learns to execute the commanded skill $k$ or reach subgoal $g_t$. Each skill policy $\pi_l^k$ maximizes the expected discounted sum of its intrinsic reward $r_t^{int, k}$.
            $$ J(\pi_l^k) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_l^k} \left[ \sum_{t'=t}^{t+N_k} \gamma_l^{t'-t} r_{t'}^{int, k} \right] $$
            where $N_k$ is the duration of skill $k$, $\gamma_l$ is the discount factor, and $r_t^{int, k}$ rewards executing the skill correctly (e.g., reaching a target pose, successfully grasping an object, reducing distance to a navigation target).
            *   *Training:* Low-level skills will be pre-trained using Imitation Learning (IL) from expert demonstrations (if available) or via self-supervised methods (e.g., reaching random valid poses) followed by RL fine-tuning (e.g., using PPO or DDPG) with dense intrinsic rewards. This bootstraps learning and ensures basic competency.

*   **Data Collection and Environment:**
    *   *Simulation Environment:* We will utilize a state-of-the-art photorealistic 3D simulator that supports rich interaction, such as Habitat 2.0 [Habitat] or AI2-THOR [AI2-THOR]. These environments provide realistic physics, diverse objects and layouts, and sensor simulation (RGB-D, potentially audio).
    *   *Data:* The agent collects data (sensor readings, actions, rewards) through interaction with the simulated environment during training.
    *   *Self-Supervised Bootstrapping:* To enhance sample efficiency, particularly for the high-level policy, we will implement a self-supervised exploration strategy. The MFM, given the current scene observation ($I_t, D_t$), will be prompted (e.g., using zero-shot capabilities or few-shot examples) to generate plausible goals or pseudo-instructions ($\hat{L}_{subtask}$) relevant to the observed objects and their affordances ($\mathcal{A}_t$). These generated goals provide training targets for the HRL agent, guiding exploration towards meaningful interactions without requiring pre-defined task datasets initially. For example, seeing a block and a box, the MFM might suggest "Put the block in the box".

*   **Algorithmic Steps & Training:**
    1.  **Pre-computation/Setup:** Select and configure the frozen MFM. Define the set of low-level skills and their associated state/action spaces and intrinsic reward functions.
    2.  **Low-Level Skill Training (Pre-training):** Train each $\pi_l^k$ using IL (if demos exist) and/or RL with intrinsic rewards in targeted scenarios (e.g., train `Grasp` skill on various objects).
    3.  **Hierarchical Training Loop:**
        a.  At the start of an episode (or high-level step), the agent observes the environment ($I_t, D_t, A_t$) and receives the high-level task $L_{task}$.
        b.  The MFM processes inputs to generate $S_t, \mathcal{A}_t, G_t$.
        c.  The high-level policy $\pi_h$ takes $s_t^h, S_t, \mathcal{A}_t, G_t$ and selects a skill/subgoal $g_t$ (index $k$).
        d.  The corresponding low-level policy $\pi_l^k$ executes actions $a_{t'}$ based on $s_{t'}^l$ and $g_t$ for multiple primitive timesteps $t'$.
        e.  $\pi_l^k$ receives intrinsic rewards $r_{t'}^{int, k}$. The experience $(s_{t'}^l, a_{t'}, r_{t'}^{int, k}, s_{t'+1}^l, g_t)$ is stored in a replay buffer for $\pi_l^k$.
        f.  The skill $\pi_l^k$ terminates upon success (subgoal reached), failure, or timeout ($N_k$ steps).
        g.  The high-level policy $\pi_h$ observes the resulting state $s_{t+N_k}^h$ and receives the accumulated extrinsic reward $r_t^{ext}$ (often sparse, e.g., only at task completion) over the duration $N_k$. The high-level transition $(s_t^h, g_t, \sum r_{t'}^{ext}, s_{t+N_k}^h)$ is stored in a replay buffer for $\pi_h$.
        h.  Update $\pi_h$ and $\pi_l^k$ using their respective RL algorithms and replay buffers.
    4.  **Self-Supervised Phase:** Interleave standard task training with phases where the MFM generates pseudo-instructions $\hat{L}_{subtask}$, which are then used as goals $G_t$ for $\pi_h$ to encourage exploration and learning of general capabilities.

*   **Experimental Design:**
    *   *Tasks:* We will evaluate HiMAC on a suite of tasks in the chosen simulator, increasing in complexity:
        1.  **Object Goal Navigation:** Navigate to a specified object ("Go to the apple").
        2.  **Pick and Place:** Pick up a specified object and place it at a target location ("Pick up the blue cup and put it on the saucer").
        3.  **Simple Rearrangement:** Modify the state of multiple objects according to instructions ("Open the microwave", "Put the sponge in the sink").
        4.  **Instruction Following with Novelty:** Tasks involving unseen objects or layouts to test generalization.
    *   *Baselines:* We will compare HiMAC against:
        1.  **Flat End-to-End RL:** A non-hierarchical policy trained directly from pixels/features to primitive actions using PPO or SAC.
        2.  **Flat MFM-RL:** A non-hierarchical policy that takes MFM features as input but outputs primitive actions directly (similar to some PaLM-E setups [2] but trained with RL).
        3.  **HRL without MFM:** A standard HRL agent (similar structure to HiMAC's bottom tier) but receiving only standard state information (no semantic maps/affordances from MFM). Possibly based on H2O2 [1] or HIDIO [4].
        4.  **Ablated HiMAC:** Versions of HiMAC with components removed (e.g., no MFM guidance for $\pi_h$, no affordance maps, no self-supervised bootstrapping) to understand the contribution of each part.
    *   *Evaluation Metrics:*
        1.  **Success Rate (SR):** Percentage of successful task completions.
        2.  **Sample Efficiency (SE):** Number of environment steps or episodes required to reach a target performance level.
        3.  **Generalization Score (G):** SR on tasks involving novel objects, instructions, or environments unseen during training.
        4.  **Task Completion Time (TCT):** Average time or number of steps taken to complete successful trials.
        5.  **Navigation/Manipulation Quality:** Metrics like path length, smoothness of motion, grasp success rate (for low-level skills).
    *   *Sim-to-Real Considerations:* While the primary focus is simulation, we will design the system with potential transfer in mind by using realistic sensor models (RGB-D) and considering domain randomization techniques during training if preliminary results are promising. This addresses [Challenge 5].

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

*   **Expected Outcomes:**
    1.  **A Functional HiMAC Framework:** A robust implementation of the proposed hierarchical architecture integrating a frozen MFM with an HRL controller.
    2.  **Demonstrated Performance Improvements:** Quantitative results showing that HiMAC achieves higher success rates, better sample efficiency, and superior generalization on complex embodied tasks compared to baseline methods.
    3.  **Validation of MFM Guidance:** Evidence demonstrating that semantic information (semantic maps, affordances, goal representations) extracted by the MFM effectively guides the high-level policy in the HRL framework, leading to more intelligent and efficient behavior.
    4.  **Effective Self-Supervised Learning:** Demonstration that MFM-generated pseudo-instructions and affordances can successfully bootstrap and accelerate the training of the HRL agent in sparse-reward or open-ended settings.
    5.  **Insights into MFM-HRL Integration:** Analysis and insights regarding the best ways to interface MFMs with HRL, the types of MFM outputs most beneficial for control, and the challenges encountered.

*   **Impact:**
    This research is expected to make significant contributions to the MFM-EAI field by providing a concrete and systematically evaluated solution to the critical challenge of integrating high-level semantic understanding with low-level robotic control [Challenge 1]. By improving sample efficiency [Challenge 2] and generalization [Challenge 3] through the synergistic combination of MFMs and HRL, this work will advance the development of more capable and autonomous embodied agents. The HiMAC framework, if successful, could serve as a blueprint for building intelligent robots for complex real-world applications, such as personalized home assistance, automated logistics, and exploration in unknown environments. The findings will inform the design of future MFM-powered agents, highlighting effective strategies for multimodal sensor fusion [Challenge 4] and paving the way for more successful sim-to-real transfer [Challenge 5]. We plan to release code and potentially trained model components to facilitate further research in the community. Ultimately, this work aims to bridge the gap between abstract AI reasoning and concrete physical action, a crucial step towards realizing the full potential of embodied intelligence.
