**Title:** Physics-Informed Multimodal Learning for Incomplete Materials Data  

**Motivation:** Materials discovery is hindered by fragmented, multimodal datasets (e.g., spectra, microscopy, simulations) and incomplete observations due to experimental limitations or unknown physics. Existing ML models struggle to integrate such heterogeneous data or generalize with missing information, slowing progress in designing advanced materials for energy, electronics, or healthcare. Addressing this could unlock faster, more reliable discovery pipelines.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a hybrid framework combining **multimodal transformers** with **physics-informed self-supervised learning** to jointly model diverse data types and impute missing information. The architecture will: (1) encode multimodal data into unified latent representations using modality-specific encoders followed by cross-attention fusion; (2) integrate domain knowledge (e.g., thermodynamic laws, crystal symmetries) as inductive biases to guide learning when data is sparse or noisy; (3) employ self-supervised tasks (e.g., masked modality reconstruction) to learn robust representations from incomplete datasets. Additionally, an active learning module will prioritize experiments to fill critical data gaps. Expected outcomes include improved predictive accuracy for material properties (e.g., bandgap, stability) and reduced experimental costs. This approach bridges the gap between data-driven ML and physics-based modeling, enabling scalable, interpretable discovery pipelines for complex materials systems.
