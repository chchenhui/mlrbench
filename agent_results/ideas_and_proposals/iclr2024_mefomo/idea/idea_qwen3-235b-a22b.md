**Efficient Fine-Tuning via Task-Driven Subspace Identification: Bridging Computation and Representation**  

2. **Motivation:**  
Fine-tuning foundation models (FMs) for downstream tasks is computationally intensive, limiting accessibility and sustainability. While prior work shows that only a small parameter subspace is often critical for adaptation, there is no principled method to identify this subspace. Understanding *which* parameters matter—and why—could reduce compute costs, energy use, and barriers to FM deployment in resource-constrained settings.  

3. **Main Idea:**  
We propose a framework to identify task-specific parameter subspaces using second-order optimization information (e.g., Fisher matrices) and activation patterns from pretraining. First, we compute the Fisher information for each parameter relative to a target task, prioritizing parameters with high task sensitivity. Second, we integrate activation magnitude and diversity metrics from pretraining to identify neurons critical for general representation. Fine-tuning is then restricted to the intersection of these high-importance subspaces. We hypothesize that this approach will match or exceed the performance of full fine-tuning while updating <10% of parameters. Methodologically, we will benchmark against LoRA and adapter layers across diverse tasks (e.g., GLUE, vision classification) and architectures (e.g., ViT, LLaMA). Additionally, we will analyze how subspace composition correlates with task complexity and data efficiency. Success would yield a practical, theory-informed protocol for efficient adaptation and deepen understanding of how FMs balance general pretraining with task-specific specialization. Impact includes democratizing FM access, reducing carbon footprints, and enabling edge deployment.
