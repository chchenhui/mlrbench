# Probing Pre-training Data Influence on Emergent Capabilities via Representation Perturbation

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background  
Foundation models (FMs) have achieved unprecedented success across diverse domains—including language, vision, and multimodal tasks—through their ability to generalize from expansive pre-training datasets. However, the mechanisms by which specific pre-training data subsets drive emergent capabilities, such as chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022), remain poorly understood. While empirical studies like *Understanding Emergent Abilities of Language Models* (Du et al., 2024) have linked emergent behavior to pre-training loss thresholds, the causal relationship between data composition, representation geometry, and downstream performance is still ambiguous. This gap hinders efficient pre-training strategies and the ethical deployment of FMs, as unexplained "black box" behaviors may exacerbate safety and bias risks (Workshop Topics: Safety & Alignment, Robustness & Biases).

### 1.2 Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to:  
1. **Identify Data-Cluster Associations**: Map pre-training data to latent representation clusters using semantic and task-specific embeddings.  
2. **Quantify Causal Impact of Subsets**: Apply targeted representation perturbations to measure the influence of specific clusters (e.g., mathematical text) on emergent capabilities like reasoning.  
3. **Characterize Emergent Mechanisms**: Link perturbation outcomes to changes in representation geometry (e.g., attention head specialization, subspace drift).  
4. **Develop Curation Guidelines**: Translate findings into actionable principles for data-efficient pre-training and capability-targeted fine-tuning.

### 1.3 Significance  
By demystifying the data-cognitive link in FMs, this research will:  
- **Accelerate Training**: Reduce computational waste by prioritizing critical data subsets (e.g., eliminating redundant text for mathematical reasoning).  
- **Enhance Alignment**: Enable mitigation of harmful biases via targeted suppression of problematic representation clusters.  
- **Advance Theoretical Understanding**: Provide empirical benchmarks for studying emergent capabilities as phase transitions in loss dynamics (Du et al., 2024), bridging empirical observations with scaling law theory (Workshop Topics: Scaling Laws, Emergent Phenomena).

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Clustering and Representation Mapping  
#### 2.1.1 Dataset Selection  
We will use three pre-training corpora:  
- **Pile-CC** (filtered Common Crawl): Broad semantic coverage.  
- **GitHub Code**: Dominant in syntax and logic patterns.  
- **ArXiv + Wikipedia**: Rich in mathematical and factual content.  

#### 2.1.2 Cluster Construction  
1. **Token-wise Contextual Embedding**: For each token $t_i$ in a sample $\mathcal{D}$, extract layer-specific representations $\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_l}$ from a pretrained FM (e.g., LLaMA-7B).  
2. **Semantic Clustering**: Apply DBSCAN to $\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}$ normalized by layer norm:  
   $$
   \mathcal{C}^s = \text{DBSCAN}\left(\frac{\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)} - \mu_l}{\sigma_l}\right),
   $$  
   where $\mu_l, \sigma_l$ are layer statistics.  
3. **Task-Specific Clustering**: For reasoning tasks (GSM8K), filter clusters with high activation $\alpha_j$ in attention heads $j$ known to handle logic (S2.1.3).  

**Validation**: Manually annotate 1% of clusters for semantic coherence (e.g., "code", "algebra"). Use Mahalanobis distances $\Delta_{\text{task}}$ to measure cluster-task associations.

### 2.2 Representation Perturbation Framework  
#### 2.2.1 Causal Mediation via Directional Perturbation  
1. **Perturbation Vector Training**:  
   For a target task $y$ (e.g., GSM8K), compute gradient-based directional perturbations in key layers $l$:  
   $$
   \delta_{\rightarrow y}^{(l)} = \text{sign}(\nabla_{\mathbf{h}^{(l)}} \mathcal{L}(y|\hat{y}))
   $$  
2. **Cluster-Specific Adversarial Injection**:  
   Perturb representations $\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}$ associated with cluster $\mathcal{C}_k$:  
   $$
   \mathbf{h}^{(l) \prime} = \mathbf{h}^{(l)} + \beta \cdot \mathbb{I}(\mathcal{C}_k) \cdot \delta_{\rightarrow y}^{(l)},
   $$  
   where $\beta$ scales perturbation magnitude.  

#### 2.2.2 Control Interventions  
- **Ablation**: Replace $\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)} \in \mathcal{C}_k$ with zeros or Gaussian noise.  
- **Swap Testing**: Exchange representations between $\mathcal{C}_k$ and $\mathcal{C}_{k^\prime}$ across models.

### 2.3 Evaluation Metrics  
#### 2.3.1 Downstream Task Performance  
- **Primary Metrics**:  
  - GSM8K: Accuracy after chain-of-thought prompting.  
  - BIG-Bench Reasoning Tasks: Zero-shot pass rates.  
- **Control Tasks**:  
  - Winograd Schemas: Coreference resolution (unrelated to perturbed clusters).  

#### 2.3.2 Representation Analysis  
- **Subspace Drift**: Compute Mahalanobis distance $\mathcal{D}_M$ between pre- and post-perturbation clusters:  
  $$
  \mathcal{D}_M(\mathcal{C}_k, \mathcal{C}^\prime_k) = \sqrt{(\mu_k - \mu^\prime_k)^T \mathbf{\Sigma}_k^{-1}(\mu_k - \mu^\prime_k)}
  $$  
- **Attention Head Specialization**: Track task-specific attention head activation $\alpha_j(t)$ using causal tracing (Workshop Topics: Architectural Analysis).

### 2.4 Experimental Design  
#### 2.4.1 Model and Training Infrastructure  
- **Base Models**: LLaMA-7B and T5-3B (enabling comparison across architectures).  
- **Control Groups**:  
  - **Full FM**: Unperturbed baseline.  
  - **Global Noise**: Uniform perturbation across all clusters.  
  - **Random Clusters**: Perturb non-target clusters.  

#### 2.4.2 Ablation Studies  
- **Cluster Size**: Test perturbations on clusters ranging from 0.1% to 50% of tokens.  
- **Layer-wise Impact**: Apply perturbations independently to embedder, mid, and final layers.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### 3.1 Scientific Insights  
1. **Causal Maps**: Quantitative evidence linking data clusters (e.g., mathematical text) to emergent capabilities. For example, perturbing algebraic representation clusters may reduce GSM8K accuracy by >20% while sparing Winograd performance.  
2. **Emergence Thresholds**: Validation of Du et al. (2024)’s hypothesis that perturbations exceeding $|\beta| > \theta$ trigger abrupt capability loss, consistent with scaling law critical transitions.  

### 3.2 Practical Tools  
1. **Cluster Identification Framework**: Open-source toolkit for analyzing FM representation clusters using DBSCAN and attention-based filters.  
2. **Curation Guidelines**: Publicly documented heuristics (e.g., "Include ≥5% code data for logical reasoning FMs at layer 14").  

### 3.3 Community and Ethical Impact  
1. **Efficient Pre-training**: Reduce redundant data consumption, lowering carbon and cost footprints by ~30% (per Moe Kayali et al., 2023 benchmark comparisons).  
2. **Bias Mitigation**: Enable suppression of harmful clusters (e.g., propagandistic text in recommendation systems) without retraining.

## 4. Conclusion  
This proposal bridges a critical gap in FM understanding by causally connecting pre-training data to emergent capabilities through representation perturbation. By developing interpretable tools to audit and optimize FMs, it supports the workshop’s goals of responsible scaling and alignment. Future work could extend this framework to multi-modal FMs, probing how cross-modal associations emerge from data interactions.
