# Distributed Adaptive Compression for Efficient Foundation Model Deployment

## Motivation
Foundation models are resource-intensive, limiting their accessibility across diverse computing environments. Current compression techniques apply uniform quantization strategies that fail to adapt to deployment contexts, resulting in either excessive performance degradation or insufficient efficiency gains. This research addresses the critical need for adaptable compression methods that can dynamically balance performance and efficiency based on available resources, democratizing access to foundation models while maintaining task performance.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel compression framework that automatically determines optimal bit-width allocations for different components of foundation models based on hardware capabilities and task requirements. Our approach incorporates: (1) A sensitivity mapping technique that identifies which model components can be aggressively compressed with minimal performance impact; (2) A reinforcement learning agent that learns to navigate the compression-performance trade-off space, making dynamic decisions about quantization levels; and (3) A resource-aware deployment protocol that progressively adapts compression settings as computing constraints change. The system continuously refines compression strategies through feedback loops during inference, allowing models to self-optimize across diverse deployment scenarios. This research will yield both practical tooling for efficient model deployment and theoretical insights into the relationship between parameter precision and model capabilities, making foundation models accessible across resource-constrained environments from edge devices to developing regions.
