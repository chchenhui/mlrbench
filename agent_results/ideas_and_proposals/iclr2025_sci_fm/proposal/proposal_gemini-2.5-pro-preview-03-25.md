## 1. Title: FedDistill-FM: Federated Distillation on Public Data for Efficient and Accessible Training of Open Foundation Models

## 2. Introduction

**Background:** Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a vast range of tasks, revolutionizing artificial intelligence research and application development (Bommasani et al., 2021). However, the training of these powerful models demands extraordinary computational resources (GPU clusters, extensive training time) and massive datasets, often exceeding billions or trillions of tokens (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022). This resource intensity creates a significant barrier to entry, concentrating the ability to develop state-of-the-art FMs within a few large, well-funded industrial labs. This centralization hinders the progress of open science, limits reproducibility, restricts access for the broader research community (especially academia and smaller institutions), and raises concerns about algorithmic transparency and potential biases embedded within proprietary models. The Workshop on Open Science for Foundation Models specifically calls for research fostering transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility in FM development, highlighting the need for innovative, efficient training strategies and open resources.

**Problem Statement:** The current paradigm for training large FMs is antithetical to the principles of open science. The requirements for centralized, massive computation and data exclude many researchers and institutions. While techniques like knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) can create smaller, more efficient "student" models from large "teacher" models, traditional distillation often requires access to the original large training dataset or the powerful teacher model itself, perpetuating access barriers. Federated Learning (FL) offers a way to train models collaboratively on decentralized data without sharing raw data (McMahan et al., 2017), aligning well with privacy concerns. However, standard FL approaches like FedAvg often suffer from high communication costs when dealing with large models and can struggle with data and model heterogeneity across clients (Li et al., 2020). Recent works have explored Federated Foundation Models (Yu et al., 2023) and Federated Distillation (FD) (Li et al., 2024), suggesting pathways to combine the strengths of these approaches. Yet, challenges remain in designing FD frameworks specifically tailored for the scale and complexity of *foundation models*, aiming for maximal efficiency, accessibility, and effective knowledge transfer from diverse, decentralized data sources without compromising privacy excessively. Specifically, we need a method that (1) avoids centralizing large, potentially sensitive datasets, (2) significantly reduces communication overhead compared to standard FL of large models, (3) handles potential heterogeneity in local data and even local model architectures, and (4) ultimately produces capable, open FMs accessible to the wider community.

**Proposed Solution:** We propose **FedDistill-FM**, a novel federated distillation framework designed explicitly for the collaborative and efficient training of open foundation models. In FedDistill-FM, multiple participating institutions (clients) collaboratively train a central, smaller "student" FM without sharing their private, potentially large-scale datasets. Each client trains a local "specialist" model (which could be a fine-tuned FM or a smaller model trained from scratch) on its own data partition. The core innovation lies in the knowledge transfer mechanism: instead of sharing model weights or gradients computed on local data, clients generate knowledge representations (e.g., prediction logits or hidden states) by running their specialist models on a *shared, smaller, public proxy dataset*. These representations are sent to a central server. The server aggregates this distilled knowledge and uses it to train the central student FM purely on the public proxy dataset, guided by the aggregated knowledge from the specialists. This approach leverages distributed data and compute resources, enhances data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing, significantly reduces communication costs (sending logits/representations is cheaper than sending FM weights), and inherently handles model heterogeneity (as only the output representations need aggregation).

**Research Objectives:**
1.  **Develop the FedDistill-FM Framework:** Formalize and implement the federated distillation architecture, including client-side specialist training, knowledge generation on the public proxy dataset, server-side knowledge aggregation, and student FM training using distillation loss.
2.  **Evaluate Performance and Efficiency:** Empirically assess the performance of the student FM trained using FedDistill-FM on relevant downstream tasks (e.g., language understanding benchmarks like GLUE, text generation) compared to baseline methods. Quantify the communication and computational efficiency gains.
3.  **Analyze Robustness to Heterogeneity:** Investigate the framework's performance under varying degrees of data heterogeneity (non-IID data distributions across clients) and potential model heterogeneity (clients using different specialist model architectures).
4.  **Study the Impact of the Public Proxy Dataset:** Analyze how the size, quality, and domain relevance of the public proxy dataset affect the final student model's performance and the efficiency of knowledge transfer.
5.  **Promote Open Science:** Release the FedDistill-FM framework implementation as open-source software and potentially share smaller FMs trained using this methodology.

**Significance:** This research directly addresses the critical challenge of resource intensity in FM training, contributing significantly to the goals of the Workshop on Open Science for Foundation Models. By enabling the collaborative creation of capable FMs with reduced computational and communication demands and enhanced privacy, FedDistill-FM can:
*   **Democratize FM Development:** Lower the barrier for academic labs, smaller institutions, and researchers in resource-constrained environments to participate in cutting-edge FM research and development.
*   **Foster Openness and Reproducibility:** Provide a transparent methodology for building open FMs, facilitating scrutiny, replication, and further innovation by the community.
*   **Enhance Data Privacy:** Allow leveraging diverse, potentially sensitive datasets distributed across institutions without requiring data centralization.
*   **Improve Efficiency:** Offer a communication-efficient alternative to standard federated learning for large models, making collaborative training more practical.
*   **Enable New Research Directions:** Open avenues for studying knowledge transfer dynamics in distributed settings, the role of public data in federated learning, and the creation of specialized yet broadly capable FMs.

## 3. Methodology

**3.1 Research Design:**
Our research will follow a constructive and empirical approach. We will first design and implement the FedDistill-FM framework. Then, we will conduct extensive experiments simulating a federated environment to evaluate its effectiveness against relevant baselines across multiple dimensions: model performance, communication efficiency, computational cost, and robustness to heterogeneity.

**3.2 FedDistill-FM Framework:**

Let $N$ be the number of participating clients (institutions). Each client $k \in \{1, ..., N\}$ possesses a private dataset $D_k$, which are potentially large and non-IID. Let $D_{pub}$ be a significantly smaller, publicly available dataset accessible to all clients and the central server. Our goal is to train a central "student" foundation model $M_S$ (e.g., a smaller Transformer like DistilBERT or TinyLlama) without accessing any $D_k$.

**Framework Components:**
*   **Clients (k=1...N):** Each client $k$ has:
    *   Private dataset $D_k$.
    *   A local "specialist" model $M_k$. $M_k$ could be pre-trained and fine-tuned on $D_k$, or trained specifically for this task. Clients might have heterogeneous architectures for $M_k$.
*   **Central Server:** Coordinates the process and trains the student model $M_S$.
*   **Public Proxy Dataset:** $D_{pub}$, used for knowledge distillation communication.

**Algorithmic Steps (Iterative Process over Communication Rounds $t=1, ..., T$):**

1.  **[Optional Local Training/Update]:** (Can happen continuously or periodically) Each client $k$ trains or fine-tunes its local specialist model $M_k$ on its private data $D_k$.
    $$ M_k \leftarrow \text{Train}(M_k, D_k) $$
    This step ensures specialists capture knowledge from their local data. The frequency and extent of this training can vary.

2.  **[Client-Side Knowledge Generation]:** At communication round $t$, the server broadcasts a request (or clients operate on a schedule). Each client $k$ processes the *entire* public proxy dataset $D_{pub}$ using its current specialist model $M_k$ to generate knowledge representations. We primarily focus on using output logits:
    For each input $x \in D_{pub}$, client $k$ computes the logits $L_k(x) = M_k(x)$.
    The client sends the set of logits $\{L_k(x) | x \in D_{pub}\}$ to the server.
    *Alternative:* Send intermediate representations or gradients w.r.t. $D_{pub}$, potentially offering different trade-offs (cf. FedFed (Yang et al., 2023), but logits are simpler and often effective for distillation).

3.  **[Server-Side Knowledge Aggregation]:** The server receives the logits $\{L_k(x)\}$ from all (or a subset of) participating clients for all $x \in D_{pub}$. It aggregates these logits to form a consolidated "teacher" signal for each input $x$. A simple aggregation method is averaging:
    $$ \bar{L}(x) = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{K}_t|} \sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}_t} L_k(x) $$
    where $\mathcal{K}_t$ is the set of clients participating in round $t$. Other aggregation methods (e.g., weighted average based on client validation performance, median) could be explored.

4.  **[Server-Side Student Training]:** The server trains the student model $M_S$ for one or more epochs on the public dataset $D_{pub}$, using the aggregated logits $\bar{L}(x)$ as the target teaching signal. The primary loss function is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the student's output probabilities and the aggregated teacher probabilities (soft targets):
    $$ L_{distill}(x) = KL( \sigma(\frac{M_S(x)}{T}) || \sigma(\frac{\bar{L}(x)}{T}) ) $$
    where $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the softmax function and $T$ is the distillation temperature (Hinton et al., 2015), a hyperparameter controlling the softness of the probability distributions.
    The total loss over the public dataset is:
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{FD} = \sum_{x \in D_{pub}} L_{distill}(x) $$
    The student model's parameters $\theta_S$ are updated using an optimizer (e.g., Adam):
    $$ \theta_S \leftarrow \theta_S - \eta \nabla_{\theta_S} \mathcal{L}_{FD} $$
    where $\eta$ is the learning rate. Optionally, a standard cross-entropy loss on $D_{pub}$ (if labels are available) could be added: $\mathcal{L}_{total} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{FD} + (1-\alpha) \mathcal{L}_{CE}$.

5.  **[Iteration]:** Repeat steps 2-4 for $T$ communication rounds. The student model $M_S$ gradually learns the collective knowledge of the specialist models distilled via the public dataset.

**Addressing Key Challenges from Literature:**
*   **Data Heterogeneity:** By distilling knowledge into common representations (logits) on a shared public dataset $D_{pub}$, the framework sidesteps direct aggregation of models trained on heterogeneous $D_k$, which plagues FedAvg. The distillation loss helps the student learn a consensus representation.
*   **Communication Efficiency:** Clients only transmit logits (or similar representations) computed on the *small* public dataset $D_{pub}$. This is significantly cheaper than transmitting the full weights or gradients of large foundation models (like in standard FL or some other FD variants). If $|D_{pub}|$ is small and the output dimension (vocab size for LLMs) is manageable, the communication cost per round is low. Compare $|D_{pub}| \times |\text{Vocab}|$ floats vs. billions of parameters.
*   **Model Heterogeneity:** Clients can potentially use different specialist model architectures ($M_k$) as long as they produce compatible output representations (e.g., logits over the same vocabulary for LLMs). The server only interacts with these representations, not the internal model structures.
*   **Privacy Preservation:** Raw private data $D_k$ never leaves the client premises. While sharing logits on a public dataset doesn't offer formal differential privacy guarantees, it's generally considered less revealing than sharing gradients computed on private data or sharing model weights directly (Li et al., 2024). The use of the public $D_{pub}$ decouples the shared information from the specifics of the private $D_k$.
*   **Scalability:** The server's computational load involves training a potentially smaller student model $M_S$ only on $D_{pub}$ and aggregating logits, which is generally manageable. The client load involves inference on $D_{pub}$ and local training. This architecture scales better with the number of clients than methods requiring pairwise interactions or complex aggregation of large models.

**3.3 Experimental Design:**

*   **Datasets:**
    *   *Private Data Simulation ($D_k$):* We will simulate heterogeneous private datasets by partitioning large-scale text corpora like C4, Wikipedia, or domain-specific datasets (e.g., PubMed for medical). Heterogeneity will be induced using standard techniques (e.g., Dirichlet distribution over classes/topics, sorting by source).
    *   *Public Proxy Dataset ($D_{pub}$):* We will use relatively small, publicly available text datasets like a subset of The Pile (Gao et al., 2020), WikiText-103, or BookCorpus. We will experiment with different sizes and domain relevance of $D_{pub}$.
    *   *Evaluation Datasets:* Standard NLP benchmarks like GLUE (Wang et al., 2018), SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019), SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), and text generation perplexity on held-out data.

*   **Models:**
    *   *Specialist Models ($M_k$):* To simulate varying capabilities, we might use pre-trained models like BERT-base, RoBERTa-base, or even larger models (if resources permit simulation via fine-tuning partitions). We will also test scenarios with heterogeneous architectures (e.g., some clients use BERT, others RoBERTa).
    *   *Student Model ($M_S$):* We will focus on training smaller, computationally efficient open FMs, such as DistilBERT (Sanh et al., 2019), TinyBERT (Jiao et al., 2019), or small variants of Llama/GPT-like models. The goal is to achieve good performance relative to the student model's size.

*   **Baselines for Comparison:**
    1.  **Centralized Training:** Train the student model $M_S$ directly on a pool of all data $\cup D_k$ (hypothetical upper bound, assumes data access).
    2.  **Centralized Distillation:** Train specialist models $M_k$ on $D_k$, then train a large teacher $M_T$ on $\cup D_k$, and finally distill $M_T$ to $M_S$ using $\cup D_k$ or $D_{pub}$ (upper bound for distillation, assumes data access for teacher).
    3.  **Standard Federated Learning (FedAvg):** Train the student model architecture $M_S$ directly using FedAvg across clients on their private data $D_k$.
    4.  **Public Data Only:** Train the student model $M_S$ only on the public dataset $D_{pub}$.
    5.  **Local Models Only:** Evaluate the performance of individual specialist models $M_k$ trained only on their $D_k$.
    6.  **Alternative FD Approaches (if applicable):** Compare with existing FD methods like FedMD (Li & Wang, 2019) or methods using feature distillation (e.g., FedFed, Yang et al., 2023) adapted to the FM context, if computationally feasible.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Model Performance:** Accuracy, F1-score, GLUE score, perplexity, BLEU/ROUGE scores (for generation), measured on standard evaluation datasets.
    *   **Communication Efficiency:** Total data transferred (Gigabytes) between clients and server over the entire training process. Compare the size of logits for $D_{pub}$ vs. model parameters.
    *   **Computational Cost:** Training time (wall clock), FLOPs required per client and server per round and overall.
    *   **Convergence Speed:** Number of communication rounds required to reach a target performance level.
    *   **Robustness:** Performance variation under different levels of data heterogeneity (measured by non-IID metrics) and model heterogeneity.

*   **Ablation Studies:**
    *   Impact of $D_{pub}$ size and domain match with $D_k$.
    *   Effect of distillation temperature $T$.
    *   Comparison of different logit aggregation methods (average, median, weighted).
    *   Impact of the number of participating clients $N$.
    *   Frequency of local specialist model updates (Step 1).
    *   Effect of using different student model ($M_S$) sizes.

**3.4 Implementation Details:**
We plan to use standard ML frameworks like PyTorch or JAX, potentially leveraging libraries designed for federated learning simulations (e.g., Flower, TensorFlow Federated) or adapting existing codebases. We will simulate the federated setting on available compute clusters.
