Title: Adaptive Information Bottleneck Framework for Efficient Human-AI Communication in Cooperative Tasks

1. Introduction  
Background  
Effective collaboration between humans and AI agents hinges critically on communication that is both informative and succinct. In many cooperative scenarios—such as search-and-rescue, assembly assistance, or decision support—AI systems risk overwhelming human partners with excessive or irrelevant details, while overly compressed messages can omit critical task information. The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a rigorous information-theoretic framework to strike an optimal trade-off between expressiveness and complexity. Although IB has been successfully used for representation learning and multi-agent communication, its application to human-AI systems, where message interpretability and human cognitive constraints must be respected, remains under-explored.

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop, implement, and evaluate an IB-based communication policy for AI agents in cooperative tasks involving human partners. The key objectives are:  
• To formulate human-AI communication as an IB optimization problem, where an AI agent learns a stochastic mapping from its internal state to compressed messages that preserve task-relevant information while minimizing overall complexity.  
• To integrate this IB objective within a deep reinforcement learning (RL) loop, enabling the agent to adapt its messaging policy through trial-and-error interactions with a human (or simulated human) partner.  
• To design mechanisms for real-time adaptation of the IB trade-off parameter $\beta$, based on observed human feedback and performance, thereby aligning communication with dynamic human cognitive load.  
• To validate the proposed framework through simulation and controlled human-subject experiments, using objective metrics (task success, message entropy) and subjective measures (cognitive load, user satisfaction).

Significance  
By embedding IB principles into human-AI communication, we anticipate:  
1. More efficient task execution (fewer communication rounds, faster completion).  
2. Reduced cognitive burden on human collaborators.  
3. Greater robustness and generalization across diverse cooperative tasks.  
4. A principled methodology that bridges information theory, cognitive science, and machine learning, fostering interdisciplinary advances.

2. Methodology  
2.1 Problem Formulation  
We model a cooperative task as a two-agent partially observable Markov decision process (PO-MDP) augmented with a communication channel. At each time step $t$, the AI agent observes an internal state $s_t\in\mathcal{S}$ summarizing its perception (e.g., environment map, goals, plans). It emits a compressed message $m_t\in\mathcal{M}$ to its human partner, who then issues an action $a_t^H$ (e.g., move object, adjust configuration). The joint reward $r_t$ reflects task success and efficiency.

We introduce a latent variable $z_t\in\mathcal{Z}$—the compressed representation of $s_t$—and define the stochastic encoder $q_\phi(z_t|s_t)$ and message decoder $p_\theta(m_t|z_t)$. Let $Y_t$ denote the task-relevant aspects of $s_t$ (e.g., target location, obstacle layout). The IB objective seeks to maximize mutual information between $Z_t$ and $Y_t$ while minimizing that between $Z_t$ and $S_t$:

$$
\max_{q_\phi, p_\theta}\; I(Z;Y)\;-\;\beta\,I(Z;S).
$$

Equivalently, we minimize the IB loss:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{IB}(\phi,\theta) \;=\; I(Z;S)\;-\;\beta\,I(Z;Y).
$$

2.2 Variational Approximation  
Direct computation of mutual information is intractable for high-dimensional observations. We adopt the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) approximation (Alemi et al., 2016). We posit a variational decoder $p_\xi(y|z)$ and a prior $r(z)$ (e.g., isotropic Gaussian or discrete uniform). The VIB loss becomes

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}_{VIB} &= \mathbb{E}_{p(s,y)}\Big[ 
-\mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|s)}[\log p_\xi(y|z)]
\Big] + \beta\,\mathbb{E}_{p(s)}\big[\KL(q_\phi(z|s)\,\|\,r(z))\big].  
\end{aligned}
$$

Here the first term encourages $Z$ to retain predictive information about $Y$, while the KL term penalizes complexity.

2.3 Integration with Reinforcement Learning  
We embed the VIB regularizer into a deep RL loop (e.g., actor-critic). Let $\pi_{\theta}(a^A|s,m)$ denote the AI agent’s policy for choosing its own actions $a^A$ (if any), and $\pi_{\theta_C}(m|s)$ the communication policy induced by $q_\phi$ and $p_\theta$. We define an augmented reward

$$
\tilde r_t = r_t - \lambda\,\KL\big(q_\phi(z_t|s_t)\,\|\,r(z)\big),
$$

where $\lambda>0$ controls the strength of compression. The AI’s policy parameters $(\theta,\phi,\xi)$ are updated to maximize expected discounted return

$$
J = \mathbb{E}_{\pi}\Big[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t \tilde r_t\Big].
$$

Policy gradients are computed via

$$
\nabla_{\theta,\phi}J \approx \mathbb{E}\Big[
\nabla_{\theta,\phi}\log\pi_{\theta_C}(m_t|s_t)\,A_t
\Big] - \lambda\,\nabla_{\theta,\phi}\KL\big(q_\phi(z_t|s_t)\,\|\,r(z)\big),
$$

where $A_t$ is the advantage estimate from a critic network. All networks (encoder $q_\phi$, decoder $p_\xi$, policy $\pi_{\theta_C}$, value function) are parameterized as deep neural nets.  

2.4 Adaptive Trade-off Parameter  
Human cognitive capacity can vary across tasks and individual users. To adaptively tune $\beta$ (or $\lambda$) in real time, we introduce a feedback signal $u_t$ derived from human performance or explicit self-reports (e.g., NASA-TLX). We define an update rule:

$$
\beta_{t+1} = \beta_t + \eta\,(u_t - u^*),
$$

where $u^*$ is a target cognitive load and $\eta$ a learning rate. High reported load increases $\beta$, promoting stronger compression; low load reduces it, allowing richer messages.

2.5 Data Collection and Simulation Environment  
We will develop multiple cooperative tasks in a simulated Unity3D environment:  
• Block-arrangement puzzle: the AI sees the target configuration and communicates instructions to a human who moves blocks.  
• Search-and-retrieve: the AI navigates a map and must guide a human partner through text or icon messages to retrieve objects.

Initial training uses simulated “human” agents driven by bounded-rational models (e.g., softmax action selection, capacity-limited decoders). These simulations allow rapid prototyping of communication policies.

2.6 Human-Subject Experiments  
After simulation, we will conduct controlled user studies (N=30–50 participants) with a within-subject design comparing:  

1. IB-driven policy with adaptive $\beta$ (our method).  
2. Fixed–$\beta$ IB policy.  
3. Unconstrained communication (no IB).  
4. Shannon-entropy regularized policy.  

Each participant will perform both tasks under each condition. Evaluation metrics include:  
– Task success rate and completion time.  
– Message complexity: average KL divergence $\KL(q(z|s)\|r(z))$ and empirically estimated bit-rate.  
– Task-relevant information preserved: approximate $I(Z;Y)$ estimated via mutual information neural estimation (MINE).  
– Subjective cognitive load: NASA-TLX scores.  
– User satisfaction and perceived clarity: 7-point Likert scales.

Statistical analysis (repeated measures ANOVA, post-hoc tests with Bonferroni correction) will assess significant differences across conditions.

2.7 Baselines and Ablation Studies  
We will compare against:  
• Rule-based communication (predefined templates).  
• Policy Learning with Language Bottleneck (Srivastava et al., 2024).  
• Vector-Quantized VIB (Tucker et al., 2022).  
Ablations will isolate the effects of adaptive $\beta$, IB objective, and RL integration.

3. Experimental Validation  
3.1 Implementation Details  
All neural networks will use convolutional encoders for visual state and fully connected layers for symbolic components. The latent space $\mathcal{Z}$ will be Gaussian with dimension $d_z\approx 16$ for continuous IB and discrete with $|\mathcal{Z}|=32$ for VQ-VIB variants. Optimizers: Adam with learning rate $10^{-4}$. Discount factor $\gamma=0.99$.

3.2 Evaluation Metrics  
• Mutual information: use MINE to estimate $I(Z;Y)$ and $I(Z;S)$.  
• Compression ratio: average KL divergence term.  
• Task performance: success rate, steps, time.  
• Cognitive load: NASA-TLX.  
• Subjective clarity: Likert scale.  

3.3 Statistical Analysis  
We will perform repeated measures ANOVA on each metric. Effect sizes (Cohen’s $d$) will be reported. Correlation analyses will explore relationships between mutual information metrics and subjective measures.

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Expected Outcomes  
• A novel IB-based RL algorithm that yields concise yet informative messages optimized for human cognitive constraints.  
• Demonstration of real-time adaptation of the IB trade-off parameter improving task performance and reducing cognitive load.  
• Empirical validation showing statistically significant improvements over strong baselines in both objective and subjective metrics.  
• Open-source codebase and dataset of human-AI interaction logs with IB signals.

Broader Impact  
• The framework provides a principled pathway to design communication interfaces for collaborative robots, virtual assistants, and decision-support systems.  
• By reducing information overload and enhancing clarity, the method can increase trust and efficiency in human-AI teams across domains (healthcare, manufacturing, education).  
• The interplay between information-theoretic formalisms and human cognitive modeling may inspire further interdisciplinary research, advancing theory in cognitive science and information theory alike.

5. Conclusion and Future Directions  
This proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to harness the Information Bottleneck principle for adaptive, efficient human-AI communication in cooperative tasks. By integrating variational IB within a deep RL framework and accounting for human cognitive feedback, we aim to realize AI agents that communicate optimally under real-world constraints. Future work may extend this framework to:  
• Multi-turn dialogues with hierarchical IB representations.  
• Multi-agent scenarios involving teams of humans and AI.  
• Richer cognitive models (memory decay, attentional focus) for more personalized communication.  

Successful completion will deliver both theoretical insights and practical tools for next-generation collaborative AI systems.
