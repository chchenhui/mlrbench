**Title:** Adversarial Collaboration Framework for Robust Scientific Hypothesis Generation

**Motivation:** Agentic AI holds promise for accelerating scientific discovery through hypothesis generation. However, ensuring the novelty, plausibility, and robustness of AI-generated hypotheses remains challenging. Current systems may generate trivial, unfalsifiable, or biased suggestions. This research aims to improve hypothesis quality by introducing structured adversarial collaboration between AI agents.

**Main Idea:** We propose an Adversarial Collaboration Framework (ACF) where multiple specialized AI agents interact competitively and cooperatively. One agent (`Generator`) proposes initial hypotheses based on data and literature. A second agent (`Critic`), trained to identify flaws, biases, and lack of novelty, challenges the hypotheses. A third agent (`Refiner`) attempts to revise the hypotheses to address the `Critic`'s concerns, potentially querying external knowledge bases or simulation tools via tool augmentation. This iterative adversarial process, inspired by scientific peer review, aims to filter weak hypotheses and refine promising ones. We will evaluate ACF in a domain like computational biology, comparing the quality (novelty, testability, potential impact) of resulting hypotheses against baseline single-agent systems and human expert evaluations. The expected outcome is a more robust and reliable pipeline for generating high-quality scientific hypotheses.
