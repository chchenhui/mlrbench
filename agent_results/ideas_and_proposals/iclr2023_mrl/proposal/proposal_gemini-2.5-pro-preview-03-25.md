## 1. Title: Explicit Geometric Alignment of Modality Manifolds for Enhanced Cross-Modal Representation Learning

---

## 2. Introduction

**2.1 Background**
Multimodal machine learning, leveraging data from diverse sources like vision, language, and audio, has become a cornerstone of modern AI research (Baltrusaitis et al., 2018; Multimodal Representation Learning, 2025; Multimodal Intelligence, 2020). The fundamental premise is that integrating information across modalities leads to richer, more robust, and generalizable representations compared to relying on unimodal data alone. These representations are crucial for a wide array of applications, including cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, image/video captioning, and audio-visual speech recognition.

A central challenge in multimodal learning is effectively fusing information from heterogeneous modalities. This typically involves learning a shared latent space where representations from different modalities corresponding to the same underlying concept are brought close together. Contrastive learning objectives, such as those used in CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), have been highly successful in achieving instance-level alignment – ensuring that paired instances (e.g., an image and its caption) have similar representations. However, merely aligning individual instances might not be sufficient to capture the underlying structural relationships between the modalities.

Recent research highlights the importance of understanding the geometric properties of these learned representation spaces (Jiang et al., 2023; Cicchetti et al., 2024). The manifolds corresponding to different modalities within the shared space may possess distinct geometric structures (curvature, density, local neighborhood relationships). Ignoring these geometric differences, or relying solely on instance-level contrastive pressure, can lead to misaligned geometries. Such misalignment might hinder effective information fusion, limit transferability to downstream tasks requiring fine-grained understanding, and potentially reduce robustness (Cai et al., 2025). Some studies even question whether strict alignment is always optimal, suggesting that preserving certain latent modality structures might be more beneficial (Jiang et al., 2023; Tjandrasuwita et al., 2025). This motivates a deeper investigation into the role of geometry and the development of methods that explicitly consider and shape the geometric relationships between modality representations during training.

**2.2 Research Problem and Motivation**
Current dominant approaches to multimodal representation learning, while effective, often induce geometric alignment implicitly as a byproduct of instance-level objectives. This implicit approach provides limited control over the resulting geometric structure of the shared space and the relationships between the modality-specific manifolds within it. Consequently, the learned representations might not preserve essential structural properties from the original modalities, potentially leading to suboptimal performance on tasks demanding nuanced cross-modal understanding or generation. Furthermore, the lack of explicit geometric constraints might make the representations less robust to variations or noise within modalities.

This research addresses the limitations of implicit geometric alignment by proposing the investigation and development of methods that *explicitly* enforce geometric consistency between modality representations in the shared latent space. We hypothesize that by directly optimizing for structural similarity – beyond simple instance proximity – we can foster the emergence of shared spaces with more desirable geometric properties. These properties, such as aligned local neighborhoods or similar distributional shapes, are expected to encode richer semantic relationships and improve the robustness and performance of multimodal models. This directly aligns with the MRL workshop's core themes, particularly concerning the properties (geometry, semantics) of multimodal representations and how training objectives can be designed to promote desirable characteristics.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop and Implement Explicit Geometric Alignment Objectives:** To formulate and integrate novel loss functions derived from Optimal Transport (OT) and Riemannian geometry principles into existing multimodal learning frameworks (e.g., based on contrastive learning). These objectives will aim to enforce structural similarity between the manifolds of different modalities in the shared embedding space.
2.  **Analyze the Geometric Properties of Learned Representations:** To systematically evaluate how different alignment strategies (implicit vs. explicit OT-based vs. explicit Riemannian-based) affect the geometric structure of the shared representation space and the relationship between modality-specific manifolds. This involves quantifying alignment, measuring neighborhood preservation, and potentially analyzing local curvature or density.
3.  **Evaluate the Impact on Downstream Task Performance:** To assess the effectiveness of the proposed geometric alignment methods on standard cross-modal benchmark tasks, particularly those requiring fine-grained understanding, such as cross-modal retrieval (image-text, video-audio) and potentially cross-modal generation or translation.
4.  **Investigate Robustness:** To study the robustness of representations learned with explicit geometric alignment against noise and potentially missing modalities, comparing them to baseline methods.

**2.4 Significance**
This research is significant for several reasons:

*   **Fundamental Understanding:** It contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of geometry in multimodal representation learning, addressing key questions posed by the MRL workshop about representation properties and modality interactions.
*   **Improved Methods:** It aims to develop novel training objectives that can lead to more semantically meaningful, robust, and effective multimodal representations, potentially surpassing the limitations of current instance-level alignment techniques.
*   **Enhanced Applications:** Better representations directly translate to improved performance in various downstream applications requiring cross-modal reasoning, retrieval, and generation.
*   **Informed Model Design:** The findings will provide insights into how to design training objectives specifically tailored to induce desired geometric properties in the learned representation space, offering a more principled approach to building multimodal models.

## 3. Methodology

**3.1 Conceptual Framework**
We conceptualize the process of multimodal representation learning as mapping data from different modalities ($M_1, M_2, ..., M_k$) into a common shared latent space $\mathcal{Z} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Each modality $M_i$ is processed by an encoder $f_i: M_i \rightarrow \mathcal{Z}$. For a batch of corresponding data samples $\{(x_j^1, x_j^2, ..., x_j^k)\}_{j=1}^N$, where $x_j^i \in M_i$ is the $j$-th sample from modality $i$, we obtain sets of embeddings $\{z_j^i = f_i(x_j^i)\}_{j=1}^N$ for each modality $i$. Our core idea is that the set of embeddings for each modality, $\{z_j^i\}_{j=1}^N$, forms an empirical sampling of an underlying manifold $\mathcal{M}_i \subset \mathcal{Z}$. Standard contrastive methods primarily enforce proximity between corresponding points $z_j^i$ and $z_j^l$ for $i \neq l$. Our approach aims to go beyond this by enforcing structural alignment between the entire manifolds (or their empirical approximations) $\mathcal{M}_i$ and $\mathcal{M}_l$.

**3.2 Proposed Methods: Explicit Geometric Alignment Objectives**
We propose incorporating explicit geometric alignment losses into the training objective alongside a standard task-specific loss (e.g., contrastive loss). The total loss function will take the form:
$$L_{Total} = L_{Task} + \lambda_{GA} L_{GA}$$
where $L_{Task}$ is a conventional loss (e.g., InfoNCE for contrastive learning) and $L_{GA}$ is the proposed geometric alignment loss, weighted by a hyperparameter $\lambda_{GA}$. We will investigate two primary families for $L_{GA}$:

**3.2.1 Optimal Transport (OT) Based Alignment:**
OT provides tools to compare probability distributions by finding the minimum "cost" to transport mass from one distribution to another. We can model the empirical distributions of embeddings for two modalities, say $X$ and $Y$, within a batch as $P_X = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N \delta_{z_j^X}$ and $P_Y = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N \delta_{z_j^Y}$, where $\delta_z$ is the Dirac delta function at point $z$. We propose minimizing the Wasserstein distance between these distributions as a measure of geometric alignment:
$$L_{OT} = W_p^p(P_X, P_Y) = \min_{\gamma \in \Pi(P_X, P_Y)} \int_{\mathcal{Z} \times \mathcal{Z}} \|z^X - z^Y\|^p d\gamma(z^X, z^Y)$$
where $\Pi(P_X, P_Y)$ is the set of all joint distributions (transport plans) with marginals $P_X$ and $P_Y$, $\| \cdot \|$ is typically the Euclidean distance in $\mathcal{Z}$ (i.e., $p=2$ for $W_2$), and $p \ge 1$. Computationally, this minimization can be solved efficiently using approximations like the Sinkhorn algorithm for an entropy-regularized version:
$$L_{OT-Sinkhorn} = \min_{T \in \mathcal{U}(r, c)} \langle T, C \rangle - \epsilon H(T)$$
where $C_{jk} = \|z_j^X - z_k^Y\|^p$ is the cost matrix, $T$ is the transport plan (a matrix), $\mathcal{U}(r, c)$ enforces the marginal constraints (often uniform vectors $r, c$ for empirical distributions), $\epsilon > 0$ is the regularization strength, and $H(T)$ is the entropy of $T$. Minimizing $L_{OT}$ encourages the overall shapes and densities of the two point clouds (empirical manifolds) to match.

**3.2.2 Riemannian Geometry Based Alignment:**
This approach focuses on preserving the intrinsic geometric structure, such as local neighborhoods or geodesic distances, across modalities.
*   **Neighborhood Preservation:** We can encourage that the local neighborhood of a point $z_j^X$ in modality $X$'s embedding space corresponds closely to the neighborhood of its paired point $z_j^Y$ in modality $Y$'s embedding space. Let $\mathcal{N}(z_j^X)$ be the set of $k$ nearest neighbors of $z_j^X$ among $\{z_l^X\}_{l=1}^N$. We can define a loss that penalizes mismatch between neighbors:
    $$L_{Neigh} = \sum_{j=1}^N \sum_{z_k^X \in \mathcal{N}(z_j^X)} \text{loss}(z_k^X, z_k^Y | z_j^X, z_j^Y)$$
    where $\text{loss}(\cdot)$ could measure the distance between $z_k^Y$ and $z_j^Y$ relative to distances within $\mathcal{N}(z_j^Y)$, or use a softer measure based on relative distances, potentially inspired by methods like Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE).
*   **Geodesic Distance Preservation (Approximate):** We can attempt to align the pairwise distance matrices within each modality's embedding set. Let $D^X$ be the matrix where $D^X_{jk} = d(z_j^X, z_k^X)$ and $D^Y$ where $D^Y_{jk} = d(z_j^Y, z_k^Y)$, using a suitable distance metric $d$ (e.g., Euclidean or potentially a geodesic approximation if working on a known manifold structure). A simple alignment loss could be the Frobenius norm of the difference:
    $$L_{DistAlign} = \| D^X - D^Y \|_F^2$$
    This encourages the relative positioning of points within one modality's manifold to mirror that within the other modality's manifold. More sophisticated manifold alignment techniques could also be adapted.

**3.3 Data Collection and Datasets**
We will primarily use standard, publicly available benchmark datasets to ensure reproducibility and comparability. Potential datasets include:
*   **Image-Text:** MS-COCO, Flickr30k. These datasets are standard for cross-modal retrieval and provide paired images and captions. Conceptual Captions could be used for larger-scale experiments.
*   **Audio-Video:** VGGSound, ActivityNet Captions. These datasets offer paired video clips and audio streams or textual descriptions, suitable for evaluating audio-visual alignment and retrieval.
The choice will depend on the specific downstream tasks selected for detailed evaluation. Data pre-processing will follow standard practices established for these datasets and baseline models (e.g., image resizing/normalization, text tokenization, audio feature extraction like Mel spectrograms).

**3.4 Algorithmic Steps**
The overall training procedure will follow a structure similar to existing deep multimodal learning frameworks:

1.  **Input:** Sample a mini-batch of paired (or multi-modal) data $\{(x_j^1, x_j^2)\}_{j=1}^B$.
2.  **Encoding:** Pass each modality's data through its respective encoder: $z_j^1 = f_1(x_j^1)$, $z_j^2 = f_2(x_j^2)$. Encoders $f_1, f_2$ could be pre-trained (e.g., ViT for images, BERT for text) and potentially fine-tuned, or trained from scratch depending on the experiment. They might include projection heads to map to the shared space $\mathcal{Z}$.
3.  **Task Loss Calculation:** Compute the primary task loss, $L_{Task}$. If using contrastive learning (e.g., InfoNCE), this involves computing pairwise similarities between all $z^1$ and $z^2$ embeddings in the batch and encouraging high similarity for matched pairs $(z_j^1, z_j^2)$ and low similarity for mismatched pairs.
4.  **Geometric Alignment Loss Calculation:** Compute the chosen geometric alignment loss $L_{GA}$ (either $L_{OT}$ or one of the Riemannian-based losses like $L_{Neigh}$ or $L_{DistAlign}$) based on the batch embeddings $\{z_j^1\}_{j=1}^B$ and $\{z_j^2\}_{j=1}^B$.
5.  **Total Loss:** Combine the losses: $L_{Total} = L_{Task} + \lambda_{GA} L_{GA}$.
6.  **Optimization:** Compute gradients of $L_{Total}$ with respect to the model parameters (encoders, projection heads) and update using an optimizer like Adam or AdamW.
7.  **Repeat:** Iterate steps 1-6 until convergence.

**3.5 Experimental Design and Validation**

**3.5.1 Baseline Methods:**
We will compare our proposed methods against strong baselines:
*   **Standard Contrastive Learning:** Models like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) or similar frameworks trained only with instance-level contrastive loss ($L_{Task}$ only, i.e., $\lambda_{GA}=0$).
*   **Related Geometric Methods:** If applicable and feasible, we may compare against methods like GRAM (Cicchetti et al., 2024) which also employ geometric principles, although potentially different ones (Gramian determinant vs. OT/Riemannian structure).

**3.5.2 Evaluation Tasks and Metrics:**
*   **Cross-Modal Retrieval:** Evaluate on image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval (or audio-to-video, etc.) using standard metrics: Recall@K (R@1, R@5, R@10) and potentially mean reciprocal rank (mRR).
*   **(Optional) Cross-Modal Generation/Translation:** Depending on resources, we might evaluate on tasks like image captioning or text-to-image synthesis, using metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr for captioning, or FID/IS for image generation. This would require integrating the learned representations into generative architectures.

**3.5.3 Geometric Analysis:**
We will perform quantitative analysis of the learned representation spaces:
*   **Distributional Similarity:** Compute the Wasserstein distance $W_2(P_X, P_Y)$ or Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the empirical distributions of embeddings from different modalities on a held-out test set. Lower values suggest better distributional alignment.
*   **Local Structure Alignment:** Define a metric based on neighborhood overlap. For each pair $(z_j^X, z_j^Y)$, find their k-nearest neighbors within their respective modality embeddings. Compute the Jaccard index or a similar overlap score between the sets of indices of these neighbors. Average this score across all pairs. Higher values indicate better local structural alignment.
*   **Procrustes Analysis:** For paired points $(z_j^X, z_j^Y)$, find the optimal rigid transformation (rotation, reflection, scaling, translation) $T$ that aligns $\{z_j^X\}$ to $\{z_j^Y\}$. The residual error after alignment (Procrustes distance) measures global shape similarity. Lower error indicates better global alignment.
*   **Visualization:** Use dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, UMAP) to visualize the embeddings, coloring points by modality, to qualitatively assess alignment and structure.

**3.5.4 Ablation Studies:**
*   Vary the weight $\lambda_{GA}$ to understand its impact on the trade-off between task performance and geometric alignment.
*   Compare the effectiveness of different $L_{GA}$ formulations (OT vs. neighborhood vs. distance alignment).
*   Evaluate the contribution of the alignment loss by comparing $L_{Task} + \lambda_{GA} L_{GA}$ against $L_{Task}$ alone using the *same* base architecture and training setup.

**3.5.5 Robustness Evaluation:**
*   **Noise Robustness:** Add varying levels of Gaussian noise to the input data of one or both modalities during evaluation and measure the degradation in retrieval performance compared to baselines.
*   **Missing Modality Robustness (if applicable):** In tasks allowing inference from a single modality (e.g., zero-shot classification using text embeddings), evaluate performance when one modality is entirely absent during testing. (This may be less relevant for retrieval but important for other downstream tasks).

**3.6 Evaluation Metrics Summary:**
*   **Task Performance:** R@1, R@5, R@10, mRR (for retrieval); BLEU, CIDEr, FID (if generation tasks are included).
*   **Geometric Analysis:** Wasserstein distance ($W_2$), MMD, Neighborhood Overlap Score, Procrustes Distance.
*   **Computational Cost:** Training time, inference time.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact

**4.1 Expected Outcomes:**

1.  **Novel Geometric Alignment Methods:** We expect to successfully formulate and implement OT-based and Riemannian geometry-inspired loss functions ($L_{OT}$, $L_{Neigh}$, $L_{DistAlign}$) that can be integrated into standard multimodal training pipelines.
2.  **Quantifiable Geometric Improvements:** We anticipate that models trained with explicit geometric alignment ($L_{GA}$) will exhibit quantitatively better geometric alignment between modality manifolds compared to baseline models trained only with instance-level contrastive loss. This should be reflected in lower Wasserstein/MMD distances, higher neighborhood overlap scores, and lower Procrustes distances.
3.  **Improved Downstream Performance:** We hypothesize that the enhanced geometric structure will lead to measurable improvements in performance on cross-modal retrieval tasks (higher R@K scores), particularly for fine-grained retrieval scenarios where subtle structural relationships are important. Potential improvements may also be observed in cross-modal generation tasks, indicating more semantically coherent representations.
4.  **Enhanced Robustness:** We expect representations learned with geometric alignment to show improved robustness to input noise compared to baselines, as the structural constraints may help stabilize the embedding space.
5.  **Insights into Alignment Dynamics:** The research will provide empirical evidence regarding the effects of explicitly enforcing different types of geometric alignment (distributional vs. local structure). The ablation studies on $\lambda_{GA}$ will illuminate the trade-offs between task performance and geometric consistency, contributing to the discussion prompted by work like Jiang et al. (2023) and Tjandrasuwita et al. (2025) about whether maximal alignment is always optimal.

**4.2 Impact:**

This research holds the potential for significant impact within the multimodal learning community and beyond:

*   **Theoretical Contribution:** It will advance our understanding of the geometric underpinnings of multimodal representation learning, directly addressing the MRL workshop's focus on representation properties, geometry, and training objectives. It will provide concrete methods and analyses concerning how the geometry of the representation space affects the quality and utility of learned multimodal representations.
*   **Methodological Advancement:** The proposed geometric alignment techniques offer a new set of tools for researchers and practitioners to build more powerful and reliable multimodal models. If successful, these methods could become standard components in future multimodal learning frameworks.
*   **Practical Applications:** Improvements in cross-modal retrieval and potentially other downstream tasks have direct implications for applications like search engines, recommender systems, accessibility tools (e.g., image captioning for the visually impaired), and creative AI. Enhanced robustness is critical for real-world deployment where data is often noisy or incomplete.
*   **Future Research Directions:** This work will likely stimulate further research into the role of geometry in deep learning, potentially exploring more sophisticated geometric alignment techniques, investigating alignment in scenarios with more than two modalities (as explored by Cicchetti et al. (2024) with GRAM), and studying the interplay between geometry, topology, and semantics in learned representations.

By focusing on the explicit control and analysis of geometric structures in shared embedding spaces, this research aims to provide valuable insights and practical methods for advancing the state-of-the-art in multimodal representation learning, aligning perfectly with the goals and themes of the MRL workshop.
