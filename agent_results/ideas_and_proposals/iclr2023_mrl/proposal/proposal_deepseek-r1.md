**Research Proposal: Geometric Alignment for Cross-Modal Representation Transfer**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Multimodal representation learning aims to integrate data from diverse modalities (e.g., text, images, audio) into a shared embedding space where cross-modal interactions can be systematically modeled. While methods like contrastive learning have advanced joint representation learning, their reliance on instance-level alignment often neglects the **geometric structure** of individual modality manifolds. Recent studies ([Cicchetti et al., 2024](#); [Jiang et al., 2023](#)) highlight that misaligned geometric structures between modalities—such as dissimilar local neighborhoods or distributional mismatches—hinder the fusion process, leading to suboptimal performance in downstream tasks like cross-modal retrieval and translation. Furthermore, empirical evidence ([Tjandrasuwita et al., 2025](#)) suggests that alignment is not universally beneficial and depends on the interplay between modality similarity and task requirements. This underscores the need for principled approaches to **geometric alignment** that balance shared and modality-specific structural properties.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research seeks to:  
1. Investigate the role of **geometric alignment** in multimodal representation learning.  
2. Develop novel training objectives that enforce structural similarity between modalities (e.g., local topology preservation, distributional consistency).  
3. Evaluate the impact of geometric alignment on downstream task performance and representation robustness.  

**Significance**  
By explicitly modeling the geometry of modality manifolds, this work aims to:  
- Improve the generalizability and robustness of multimodal models to noise, missing modalities, and adversarial attacks.  
- Provide insights into the theoretical foundations of geometric alignment and its relationship to cross-modal transfer.  
- Establish standardized metrics for evaluating the structural properties of multimodal representations.

### 2. **Methodology**  

**Research Design**  
The proposed framework (Figure 1) involves three stages: (1) **Unimodal Encoding**, (2) **Geometric Alignment**, and (3) **Downstream Task Optimization**.  

**1. Unimodal Encoding**  
Each modality (e.g., text, image) is encoded into a low-dimensional space using modality-specific neural networks:  
- Text encoder: $f_t(\cdot; \theta_t) \rightarrow \mathbf{z}_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$  
- Image encoder: $f_i(\cdot; \theta_i) \rightarrow \mathbf{z}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$  

**2. Geometric Alignment**  
We introduce two alignment objectives:  

**a) Optimal Transport (OT) for Global Distribution Matching**  
Align the global distributions of modality embeddings using the Wasserstein distance:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{OT}} = \min_{\gamma \in \Pi(P_t, P_i)} \sum_{j,k} \gamma_{jk} \cdot C(\mathbf{z}_t^{(j)}, \mathbf{z}_i^{(k)})  
$$  
where $\gamma$ is the coupling matrix, $C$ is a cost function (e.g., cosine distance), and $P_t, P_i$ are the text and image embedding distributions.  

**b) Riemannian Manifold Alignment (RMA)**  
Enforce geometric consistency between local neighborhoods on modality-specific manifolds. For each anchor embedding $\mathbf{z}_t^{(j)}$, we preserve its $k$-nearest neighbors $N_k(\mathbf{z}_t^{(j)})$ in the image embedding space:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{RMA}} = \sum_{j} \sum_{\mathbf{z}_i^{(k)} \in N_k(\mathbf{z}_t^{(j)})} \left\| \mathbf{z}_t^{(j)} - \mathbf{z}_i^{(k)} \right\|^2  
$$  

**3. Downstream Task Optimization**  
Jointly optimize alignment and task-specific losses (e.g., cross-modal retrieval loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{retrieve}}$) via multi-task learning:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{OT}} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{\text{RMA}} + \gamma \mathcal{L}_{\text{retrieve}}  
$$  

**Experimental Design**  
- **Datasets**: Use HowTo100M (video-audio-text), COCO (image-text), and Audioset (audio-text) for diverse modality pairs.  
- **Baselines**: Compare against contrastive learning (CLIP), GRAM [Cicchetti et al., 2024], and Brownian-bridge alignment [Jiang et al., 2023].  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Task Performance**: Recall@k (retrieval), BLEU-4 (translation).  
  - **Geometric Analysis**: Procrustes distance (manifold similarity), graph connectivity metrics.  
  - **Robustness Tests**: Accuracy under missing modalities and adversarial perturbations.  
- **Ablation Study**: Isolate contributions of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{OT}}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RMA}}$.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Cross-Modal Task Performance**: The proposed geometric alignment framework will outperform existing methods in cross-modal retrieval and translation tasks, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous modalities (e.g., audio-visual pairs).  
2. **Enhanced Representation Robustness**: The learned representations will exhibit greater resilience to missing inputs (e.g., 10–20% improvement in retrieval accuracy with 30% missing data).  
3. **Quantifiable Geometric Insights**: Metrics like Procrustes distance will reveal tighter manifold alignment, correlating with downstream task gains.  

**Broader Impact**  
- **Theoretical**: Advance understanding of how geometric alignment influences information transfer across modalities, potentially refining existing frameworks like contrastive learning.  
- **Practical**: Enable more robust multimodal systems for healthcare (e.g., MRI-text diagnosis), robotics (sensor fusion), and accessibility (multimodal assistive technologies).  
- **Community**: Standardized evaluation protocols for geometric properties in multimodal learning, fostering reproducibility and benchmarking.
