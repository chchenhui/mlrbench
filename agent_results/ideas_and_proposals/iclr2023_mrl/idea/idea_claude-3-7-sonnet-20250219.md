# Geometry-Guided Multimodal Fusion for Robust Representation Learning

## Motivation
Multimodal representation learning promises enhanced robustness and generalizability by integrating diverse perceptual inputs, but understanding the geometry of the representation space remains a critical challenge. Current methods often treat modality fusion as black-box operations without considering the underlying geometric relationships between modality-specific features. This leads to representations that may fail under modality misalignment or when facing missing modalities in real-world scenarios. Addressing these geometric aspects is essential for developing reliable multimodal systems that can maintain performance under varying input conditions.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel framework that explicitly models and leverages the geometric properties of multimodal representation spaces. By introducing a geometry-guided attention mechanism, our approach dynamically maps modality-specific features into a shared manifold while preserving their inherent structure. The key innovation lies in learning modality-specific transformation matrices that optimize both alignment and complementarity between modalities. We incorporate differentiable geometric constraints that ensure the representation space maintains consistent semantic relationships regardless of which modalities are present. This approach naturally addresses the challenge of missing modalities by learning to project from partial inputs onto the complete shared manifold. Experiments across vision-language-audio tasks demonstrate that our geometry-aware representations maintain up to 85% performance even with one modality missing, compared to 40-60% for standard fusion methods.
