Title:
Knowledge-Driven Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity Synthetic Financial Time-Series Generation

1. Introduction  
Background  
Synthetic data generation has become a cornerstone for advancing machine learning in domains where privacy, confidentiality and regulatory compliance limit access to real data. In finance, obtaining large-scale, high-quality time-series (e.g. transaction logs, asset prices, fraud patterns) is particularly challenging. Traditional approaches (GANs, VAEs, copulas) often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies such as volatility clustering, long-range correlations, and domain-specific constraints arising from regulatory rules or market microstructure. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently achieved state-of-the-art results in image and tabular data synthesis, but their application to financial time series remains underexplored.  

Motivation & Research Objectives  
We propose a hybrid generative framework that integrates (a) DDPMs for their proven ability to learn complex distributions via a simple noise-reversal process, and (b) domain knowledge encoded in a financial knowledge graph (KG) to enforce regulatory and market constraints. The core objectives are:  
• To design a conditional diffusion model whose reverse noising process is guided by embeddings from a graph neural network (GNN) over a KG of regulatory rules, causal market relationships and temporal correlations.  
• To ensure generated sequences not only match real data in statistical fidelity (marginal and joint distributions, autocorrelation, volatility clustering) but also comply with domain constraints (e.g. anti-money laundering thresholds, liquidity rules).  
• To validate synthetic data utility on downstream tasks—fraud detection, risk modeling—and assess privacy leakage.  

Significance  
A successful framework will:  
• Democratize R&D in financial AI by providing high-quality, privacy-preserving synthetic datasets.  
• Accelerate innovations in anomaly detection, algorithmic trading, and risk assessment under a compliance-ready regime.  
• Offer a blueprint for responsible AI in finance, balancing utility, privacy and regulatory adherence.

2. Methodology  
2.1 Data Collection & Preprocessing  
• Real Datasets:  
  – Public equity price time-series (e.g., S&P 500 minute-level data).  
  – Credit card transaction logs with labeled fraud events (e.g., Kaggle Credit Card Fraud).  
  – Simulated private datasets (to test domain-expert rules).  
• Preprocessing Steps:  
  1. Window segmentation: extract sliding windows of length $L$ (e.g. 100 timesteps).  
  2. Log-return transformation for price series:  
     $$ r_t = \log\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}. $$  
  3. Normalization: min-max or z-score per feature.  
  4. Label embedding (for fraud windows) if generating anomaly patterns.

2.2 Knowledge Graph Construction  
Define a directed, attributed graph $G=(V,E,X_v,X_e)$ where:  
• $V$ represents entities or variables (accounts, assets, transaction types).  
• $E$ encodes relationships (regulatory rules, causal links, sector correlations).  
• $X_v\in\mathbb{R}^{|V|\times d_v}$ are node attributes (e.g. risk scores, asset class).  
• $X_e\in\mathbb{R}^{|E|\times d_e}$ are edge attributes (e.g. correlation coefficients, rule thresholds).  
Construction pipeline:  
1. Domain-expert rule encoding: anti-money laundering (AML) rules become edges with thresholds.  
2. Statistical correlation: connect asset nodes if Pearson correlation $|\rho|> \tau$.  
3. Causal links from economic reports: e.g. Fed rate changes → bond yields.  

2.3 Diffusion Model Architecture  
We adopt a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) conditional on $G$.  
Forward (noising) process:  
$$ q(x_t\mid x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}\bigl(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}\,x_{t-1},\,\beta_t I\bigr), \quad t=1\ldots T. $$  
Reverse (denoising) process parameterized by $\theta$ and conditioned on graph embedding $\mathbf{h}_G$:  
$$ p_\theta(x_{t-1}\mid x_t, G) = \mathcal{N}\!\bigl(x_{t-1};\,\mu_\theta(x_t,t,\mathbf{h}_G),\,\Sigma_\theta(t)\bigr). $$  
Here $\mu_\theta$ and $\Sigma_\theta$ are output by a neural denoiser that fuses time-series features and $\mathbf{h}_G$.  

Graph Neural Network (GNN) for KG embedding:  
We compute node embeddings via $L$ layers of message passing:  
$$ m_{uv}^{(l)} = \text{ReLU}\bigl(W_1^{(l)}h_u^{(l)} + W_2^{(l)}h_v^{(l)} + b^{(l)}\bigr),\quad  
h_v^{(l+1)} = \text{ReLU}\Bigl(W_3^{(l)}h_v^{(l)} + \sum_{u\in \mathcal{N}(v)}m_{uv}^{(l)}\Bigr). $$  
A readout function (mean or attention) aggregates $\{h_v^{(L)}\}$ into a global embedding $\mathbf{h}_G\in\mathbb{R}^d$.  

Denoiser network:  
• A 1D-UNet over time dimension with residual blocks, each block conditioned on timestep $t$ via sinusoidal embeddings.  
• Graph conditioning via FiLM layers: in each residual block, we apply feature-wise linear modulation:  
  $$ \text{FiLM}(x \mid \mathbf{h}_G) = \gamma(\mathbf{h}_G)\odot x + \beta(\mathbf{h}_G), $$  
  where $\gamma,\beta$ are small MLPs mapping $\mathbf{h}_G\to\mathbb{R}^{\text{channel}}$.  
• Output: predicted noise $\epsilon_\theta(x_t,t,\mathbf{h}_G)$.

2.4 Training Objective  
We follow the standard DDPM loss, augmented with constraint penalties:  
1. Reconstruction loss:  
   $$ \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{DDPM}} = \mathbb{E}_{x_0,\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I),\,t}\!\Bigl[\bigl\|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\tilde x_t,t,\mathbf{h}_G)\bigr\|^2\Bigr], $$  
   where $\tilde x_t = \sqrt{\alpha_t}x_0 + \sqrt{1-\alpha_t}\epsilon$ and $\alpha_t = \prod_{s=1}^t(1-\beta_s)$.  
2. Constraint loss: for each rule $c_i:\mathbb{R}^L\to\mathbb{R}$ (e.g. AML transaction thresholds), define  
   $$ \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{cons}} = \mathbb{E}_{\hat x\sim p_\theta}\sum_i\max\bigl(0,\,c_i(\hat x)-\tau_i\bigr)^2. $$  
Overall objective:  
$$ \min_\theta \; \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{DDPM}} + \lambda\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{cons}}, $$  
where $\lambda$ balances fidelity and constraint adherence.

2.5 Sampling Procedure  
To generate a synthetic sequence:  
Algorithm:  
1. Initialize $x_T\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)$.  
2. Compute $\mathbf{h}_G$ from the KG.  
3. For $t=T\ldots1$:  
   a. Predict noise $\hat\epsilon = \epsilon_\theta(x_t,t,\mathbf{h}_G)$.  
   b. Compute $\mu_\theta(x_t,t,\mathbf{h}_G)$ via the parameterization in [Ho et al.].  
   c. Sample $x_{t-1}\sim\mathcal{N}\bigl(\mu_\theta,\Sigma_\theta(t)\bigr)$.  
4. Return $x_0$ as the synthetic time series.

Evaluation Metrics  
1. Statistical Fidelity  
   • Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD):  
     $$ \mathrm{MMD}^2 = \Bigl\|\mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{\mathrm{real}}}[\phi(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{\mathrm{syn}}}[\phi(x)]\Bigr\|^2. $$

   • Mean and max violation magnitude.  
3. Downstream Task Utility  
   • Fraud detection AUC and F1: train classifier on synthetic vs real; test on held-out real data.  
   • Risk model calibration: e.g. Value-at-Risk (VaR) backtesting.  
4. Privacy & Robustness  
   • Membership inference attack accuracy.  
   • k-nearest neighbor distance to real samples.  
5. Efficiency

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate that our knowledge-driven diffusion framework will:  
1. Achieve lower MMD and closer ACF/PACF alignment compared to baselines, demonstrating superior statistical fidelity.  
2. Exhibit near-zero constraint violation rates, ensuring synthetic sequences respect regulatory and causal rules.  
3. Support downstream fraud detection models with AUC within 5% of models trained on real data, evidencing practical utility.  
4. Reduce membership inference accuracy to near random‐guess, signaling strong privacy guarantees.  
5. Generate realistic sequences in under 0.5 s per window (on GPU), meeting efficiency requirements for large-scale generation.

Impact on Financial AI  
• Research Democratization: institutions and academics can safely share and benchmark on synthetic datasets.  
• Compliance-Ready AI: models trained on synthetic data will inherently satisfy encoded regulations, easing audit and approval.  
• Innovation Acceleration: ready availability of high-fidelity data will spur advances in algorithmic trading strategies, real-time risk assessments and anomaly detection.  
• Ethical AI: by embedding domain knowledge explicitly, we promote transparency and accountability in generative processes.

In summary, our proposal paves the way for responsible, high-fidelity synthetic financial time-series generation by unifying the strengths of diffusion models and knowledge graphs. This work stands to transform how financial institutions and researchers access, share and build upon time-series data under stringent privacy and regulatory regimes.
