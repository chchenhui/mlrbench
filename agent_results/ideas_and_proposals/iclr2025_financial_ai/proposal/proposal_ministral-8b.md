# Knowledge-Driven Diffusion Models for Generation of High-Fidelity Synthetic Financial Time-Series

## 1. Introduction

The financial industry is undergoing a transformative shift driven by the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence. AI is revolutionizing various aspects of financial services, from algorithmic trading and fraud detection to personalized banking and investment strategies. However, the widespread adoption of AI in finance is hindered by significant challenges, particularly the scarcity of high-quality, privacy-compliant data for training AI models due to regulatory restrictions and data sensitivity.

Existing synthetic data generation methods often fail to capture complex temporal dependencies and domain-specific constraints, limiting their utility in financial applications. For instance, regulatory rules, market dynamics, and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements are critical factors that must be considered to ensure the validity and compliance of synthetic data. Creating realistic, customizable synthetic time-series data could democratize AI research in finance while enabling safe innovation.

This research aims to address these challenges by proposing a hybrid framework that combines diffusion models and domain-specific knowledge graphs to generate synthetic financial time-series data. The knowledge graph encodes regulatory rules, temporal correlations, and causal market relationships, guiding the diffusion process via a graph neural network (GNN) during training. This ensures that synthetic sequences satisfy domain-specific validity constraints. The proposed method learns to reverse noise injected into real datasets while respecting knowledge graph-guided priors, resulting in high-fidelity synthetic data that can be used for training AI models, reducing privacy risks, and fostering compliance-ready AI development.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Research Design

The proposed research involves the development and evaluation of a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion models with domain-specific knowledge graphs. The framework comprises the following key components:

1. **Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph**: This graph encodes regulatory rules, temporal correlations, and causal market relationships. It serves as a prior that guides the diffusion process, ensuring that the generated synthetic data adheres to domain-specific constraints.
2. **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**: The GNN is used to embed the knowledge graph and incorporate domain knowledge into the diffusion model. It captures complex relationships and constraints within the graph, providing a structured representation that can be used to guide the diffusion process.
3. **Diffusion Model**: The diffusion model learns to reverse noise injected into real datasets, generating synthetic data that mimics the statistical properties of real data. The model incorporates the knowledge graph-guided priors provided by the GNN, ensuring that the generated data adheres to domain-specific constraints.

### 2.2 Data Collection

The research will utilize real-world financial time-series datasets, such as transaction logs, asset prices, and fraud patterns. These datasets will be used to train the diffusion model and evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. To ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations, the datasets will be anonymized and preprocessed to remove sensitive information.

### 2.3 Algorithmic Steps

The algorithmic steps for the proposed framework are as follows:

1. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Construct a domain-specific knowledge graph that encodes regulatory rules, temporal correlations, and causal market relationships. This graph will serve as a prior that guides the diffusion process.
2. **Graph Neural Network Training**: Train a GNN on the knowledge graph to embed the graph and capture the complex relationships and constraints within it.
3. **Diffusion Model Training**: Train a diffusion model on real financial time-series data, incorporating the knowledge graph-guided priors provided by the GNN. The model learns to reverse noise injected into the real data, generating synthetic data that mimics the statistical properties of the real data while adhering to domain-specific constraints.
4. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Use the trained diffusion model to generate synthetic financial time-series data that adheres to domain-specific constraints. The synthetic data can be used for training AI models, reducing privacy risks, and fostering compliance-ready AI development.

### 2.4 Mathematical Formulas

The diffusion model used in this research will be based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) framework. The DDPM framework involves the following key steps:

1. **Forward Process**: The forward process involves adding Gaussian noise to the real data at each time step, creating a noisy version of the data.
2. **Reverse Process**: The reverse process involves learning to reverse the forward process by denoising the noisy data at each time step. This is done by training a neural network to predict the noise added at each time step, given the noisy data and the time step.

The forward process can be represented as follows:

$$
q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
$$

where $x_t$ is the noisy data at time step $t$, $x_{t-1}$ is the real data at time step $t-1$, $\beta_t$ is the noise schedule, and $I$ is the identity matrix.

The reverse process can be represented as follows:

$$
p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t))
$$

where $\mu_\theta(x_t, t)$ and $\Sigma_\theta(x_t, t)$ are the mean and covariance of the distribution at time step $t$, predicted by the neural network $\theta$.

### 2.5 Experimental Design

To validate the proposed method, the following experimental design will be employed:

1. **Dataset Selection**: Select a diverse set of real-world financial time-series datasets, including transaction logs, asset prices, and fraud patterns. The datasets will be anonymized and preprocessed to remove sensitive information.
2. **Baseline Models**: Train and evaluate baseline models, including diffusion models without domain-specific knowledge graphs, to establish a performance baseline.
3. **Proposed Method**: Train and evaluate the proposed hybrid framework that combines diffusion models with domain-specific knowledge graphs. The framework will be evaluated using a range of metrics, including statistical fidelity, constraint adherence, and downstream task performance.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: The performance of the proposed method will be evaluated using the following metrics:
	* **Statistical Fidelity**: Measure the distributional similarity between the synthetic data and the real data using metrics such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test and the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD).
	* **Constraint Adherence**: Evaluate the extent to which the synthetic data adheres to domain-specific constraints, such as regulatory rules and market dynamics. This will be done by comparing the synthetic data to real data that satisfies the constraints.
	* **Downstream Task Performance**: Evaluate the performance of AI models trained on the synthetic data using downstream tasks, such as fraud detection and risk modeling. This will be done by comparing the performance of models trained on the synthetic data to models trained on the real data.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact
