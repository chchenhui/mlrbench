**Research Proposal: Multi-Objective Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning for Personalized Clinical Decision Support Systems**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training AI systems using human feedback, circumventing the need for explicit numerical reward functions. This approach is particularly valuable in healthcare, where clinical decisions involve complex trade-offs between competing objectives such as treatment efficacy, side effects, cost, and quality of life. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle in this domain due to the difficulty of designing accurate reward functions that capture nuanced physician expertise. Recent advances in multi-objective optimization and preference modeling—such as the Preference Transformer [1] and fairness-aware PbRL [2]—highlight the potential for combining these techniques to address healthcare challenges. However, existing methods often assume a single objective or static preferences, limiting their applicability to dynamic, patient-specific scenarios.  

**Research Objectives**  
This project aims to develop a **Multi-Objective Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning (MOPBRL)** framework for clinical decision support. Specific objectives include:  
1. Designing a preference elicitation mechanism to capture clinician expertise through pairwise comparisons of treatment trajectories.  
2. Integrating multi-objective optimization to maintain a Pareto front of policies representing trade-offs between competing healthcare goals.  
3. Learning a personalized policy distribution that aligns with both patient-specific priorities and clinician preferences.  
4. Validating the framework on chronic disease management tasks (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) using real-world electronic health records (EHRs) and simulated environments.  

**Significance**  
The proposed framework will enable more transparent and adaptive clinical decision-making by:  
- Reducing reliance on oversimplified numerical reward functions.  
- Incorporating clinician preferences into policy optimization dynamically.  
- Providing interpretable trade-off analyses for personalized treatment plans.  
This work bridges gaps between theoretical advances in PbRL and practical healthcare applications, addressing key challenges such as data scarcity, fairness, and interpretability [3, 4].

### 2. **Methodology**  

**Research Design**  
The framework comprises three components: (1) preference elicitation, (2) multi-objective RL optimization, and (3) policy personalization (Fig. 1).  

**1. Data Collection**  
- **Real-World EHRs:** De-identified patient data from chronic disease cohorts (e.g., HbA1c levels for diabetes, blood pressure readings for hypertension).  
- **Simulated Environments:** Clinician-in-the-loop simulators (e.g., FDA-approved Type 1 Diabetes Simulator) to generate synthetic trajectories for rare scenarios.  
- **Preference Feedback:** Clinicians rank pairs of treatment trajectories via a web interface, indicating preferences based on efficacy, side effects, and other objectives.  

**2. Algorithmic Framework**  
**A. Preference Elicitation with Bayesian Logistic Regression**  
Clinician preferences are modeled using a Bradley-Terry model. For trajectory pairs $(A, B)$, the probability that $A$ is preferred over $B$ is:  
$$
P(A \succ B) = \frac{\exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^k w_i \phi_i(A)\right)}{\exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^k w_i \phi_i(A)\right) + \exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^k w_i \phi_i(B)\right)},  
$$  
where $\phi_i(\cdot)$ denotes the cumulative reward for objective $i$, and $w_i$ are learnable weights. A Bayesian approach infers a posterior distribution over $w_i$ using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, enabling uncertainty quantification.  

**B. Multi-Objective RL with Pareto Front Maintenance**  
We extend Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to handle multiple objectives. The policy $\pi_\theta$ maximizes a vector-valued reward $\mathbf{r} = [r_1, r_2, \dots, r_k]$, where each $r_i$ corresponds to an objective (e.g., glucose control, hypoglycemia avoidance). The Pareto front is approximated using:  
1. **Linear Scalarization:** Policies are trained with different weight vectors $\mathbf{\alpha} \in \Delta^{k-1}$ (simplex).  
2. **Pareto Optimization:** A non-dominated sorting algorithm [7] iteratively updates the front by comparing policies across all objectives.  

The value function for objective $i$ is defined as:  
$$
V_i^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_i(s_t, a_t) \mid \pi, s_0 = s\right],  
$$  
and the multi-objective Bellman equation becomes:  
$$
\mathbf{V}^\pi(s) = \mathbf{r}(s, \pi(s)) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{s'}\left[\mathbf{V}^\pi(s')\right].  
$$  

**C. Policy Personalization**  
For a patient with features $\mathbf{x}$ (e.g., age, comorbidities), a meta-learner maps $\mathbf{x}$ to a preferred region of the Pareto front. A Gaussian process (GP) models the relationship:  
$$
\mathbf{\alpha}^*(\mathbf{x}) = \text{GP}\left(\mathbf{x}, \{\mathbf{\alpha}_j, \mathbf{x}_j\}_{j=1}^N\right),  
$$  
where $\mathbf{\alpha}_j$ are optimal weights for similar historical patients. The final policy for the patient is:  
$$
\pi_{\text{final}} = \sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i^*(\mathbf{x}) \pi_i.  
$$  

**3. Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines:** Compare against single-objective RL, multi-objective RL without preferences [9], and static preference weighting.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  1. **Clinical Utility:** Percentage of treatment recommendations aligned with gold-standard guidelines.  
  2. **Preference Alignment:** Kendall’s $\tau$ correlation between clinician rankings and model-predicted preferences.  
  3. **Pareto Front Analysis:** Hypervolume ratio measuring coverage of the objective space.  
  4. **Robustness:** Performance under data scarcity (10%–50% subsampled EHRs).  

- **Validation:** Deploy the framework in a simulated diabetes management environment with 10 clinicians providing preference feedback. Statistical significance tested via paired t-tests ($p < 0.05$).

### 4. **Conclusion**  
This proposal outlines a rigorous methodology for developing a multi-objective preference-based RL system tailored to healthcare. By bridging advances in RL, optimization, and human-computer interaction, the framework has the potential to transform clinical decision-making into a more collaborative, transparent, and patient-centric process. Successful implementation will pave the way for applications in other preference-driven domains, such as robotics and personalized education.
