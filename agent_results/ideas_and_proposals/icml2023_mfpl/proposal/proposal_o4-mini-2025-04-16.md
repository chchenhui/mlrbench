1. Title  
Multi-Objective Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning for Personalized Clinical Decision Support in Chronic Disease Management

2. Introduction  
Background  
Healthcare decision‐making often involves balancing multiple conflicting objectives—efficacy of treatment, risk of side effects, cost, and patient quality of life. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods rely on hand‐crafted scalar reward functions, which are difficult to define accurately in complex clinical contexts. Physicians naturally reason in terms of trade‐offs (“I prefer slightly lower efficacy if it reduces side‐effect risk by this amount”), making relative or preference‐based feedback more intuitive and reliable than absolute numerical rewards. Preference‐based RL (PbRL) has shown promise in areas such as robotics, image generation, and large‐language‐model fine‐tuning, but most PbRL methods assume a single underlying objective or scalar reward. In healthcare, however, objectives are inherently multi‐dimensional and often in conflict.  

Research Objectives  
We propose a novel Multi‐Objective Preference‐Based Reinforcement Learning (MO‐PbRL) framework for clinical decision support in chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes, hypertension). Our specific objectives are:  
• Formulate clinical decision‐making as a multi‐objective Markov decision process (MO‐MDP) with vector‐valued rewards corresponding to efficacy, side-effect risk, cost, and quality of life.  
• Elicit clinician preferences over treatment trajectories via pairwise comparisons and infer a posterior distribution over scalarization weights that explains these preferences.  
• Develop an online/offline algorithm that (i) learns a distribution of policies approximating the Pareto front of the MO‐MDP and (ii) selects or adapts a policy to individual patient and clinician priorities.  
• Validate on real or realistic simulated chronic‐disease datasets, comparing MO‐PbRL to single‐objective baselines and demonstrating improved trade‐off handling, interpretability, and clinical outcomes.  

Significance  
By aligning RL policy learning with how clinicians naturally express trade‐offs, MO‐PbRL promises more transparent, trustworthy, and personalized clinical decision support. Maintaining a Pareto front of treatment strategies enables adaptation to different patient priorities (e.g., cost‐sensitive vs. risk‐averse) without requiring clinicians to specify weightings a priori. This research bridges gaps between multi‐objective optimization, human‐in‐the‐loop learning, and healthcare AI, with potential impact on chronic disease management and beyond.

3. Methodology  
3.1 Problem Formulation  
We model chronic disease treatment planning as an MO‐MDP defined by the tuple $$\langle\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},P,r,\gamma\rangle$$ where  
– $\mathcal{S}$ is the patient‐state space (e.g., blood glucose, blood pressure, comorbidities).  
– $\mathcal{A}$ is the action space (e.g., dosage adjustments).  
– $P(s'|s,a)$ is the transition probability, learned from historical EHR data or clinical simulators.  
– $r(s,a)\in\mathbb{R}^d$ is a $d$‐dimensional reward vector capturing multiple objectives:  
   • $r_1$: clinical efficacy (e.g., reduction in A1C).  
   • $r_2$: side‐effect risk (negative of side‐effect probability).  
   • $r_3$: treatment cost.  
   • $r_4$: quality‐of‐life score.  
– $\gamma\in(0,1)$ is the discount factor.  

The vector‐valued return under policy $\pi$ is  
$$
\mathbf{J}(\pi) \;=\; \mathbb{E}_{\tau\sim\pi}\Bigl[\sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t\,r(s_t,a_t)\Bigr]\;\in\mathbb{R}^d.
$$  

Rather than committing to a fixed scalarization $w\in\Delta^{d-1}$, we maintain a distribution over weight vectors $p(w)$. Given a weight $w$, the scalarized return is  
$$
J_w(\pi) \;=\; w^\top \mathbf{J}(\pi)\,,
$$  
and the optimal policy for $w$ is $\pi_w^* = \arg\max_\pi J_w(\pi)$.

3.2 Preference Elicitation and Inference  
Clinicians are shown two treatment trajectories (rollouts) $\tau^i,\tau^j$ and asked “Which do you prefer?” We model the probability that trajectory $\tau^i$ is preferred over $\tau^j$ under weight $w$ by a Bradley–Terry–Luce (BTL) or logistic model:  
$$
P(\tau^i \succ \tau^j \mid w) \;=\;\sigma\bigl(w^\top\bigl(\mathbf{R}(\tau^i)-\mathbf{R}(\tau^j)\bigr)\bigr),
$$  
where $\sigma(x)=1/(1+e^{-x})$ and $\mathbf{R}(\tau)=\sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t\,r(s_t,a_t)$. Starting from a prior $p_0(w)$ (e.g., uniform Dirichlet), we maintain a posterior  
$$
p(w \mid \mathcal{D}) \;\propto\; p_0(w)\;\prod_{(i,j)\in\mathcal{D}}P(\tau^i\succ\tau^j\mid w),
$$  
where $\mathcal{D}$ is the set of clinician‐provided preferences. We approximate $p(w\mid\mathcal{D})$ via Bayesian sampling (e.g., SVI, MCMC) or variational inference.

3.3 Policy Learning and Pareto Front Approximation  
We draw $N$ weight samples $\{w^{(k)}\}_{k=1}^N\sim p(w\mid\mathcal{D})$ and learn corresponding policies $\{\pi_{\theta_k}\}$ by solving scalarized RL subproblems. We use an actor‐critic architecture where each weight sample has its own critic. For sample $k$:  
– Critic update for $Q_k(s,a)\approx Q_{w^{(k)}}^\pi(s,a)$ using temporal‐difference learning.  
– Actor update via policy gradient:  
  $$
  \nabla_{\theta_k}J_{w^{(k)}}(\pi_{\theta_k}) 
  = \mathbb{E}_{s,a\sim\pi_{\theta_k}}\bigl[w^{(k)\top}Q_k(s,a)\,\nabla_{\theta_k}\log\pi_{\theta_k}(a\mid s)\bigr].
  $$

Pseudocode:  
1. Initialize $\{\theta_k\},\{Q_k\}$, dataset $\mathcal{D}$, prior $p_0(w)$.  
2. Repeat until convergence:  
   a. Sample trajectories under each $\pi_{\theta_k}$ to construct state‐action pairs.  
   b. Simultaneously query clinicians: select trajectory pairs $(\tau^i,\tau^j)$ that maximize information gain (e.g., maximize entropy reduction in $p(w)$). Record preferences to update $\mathcal{D}$.  
   c. Update posterior $p(w\mid\mathcal{D})$ and re‐sample $\{w^{(k)}\}$.  
   d. For each $k$:  
      i. Critic TD‐update on $Q_k$.  
     ii. Actor policy‐gradient step on $\theta_k$.  
3. Output set of policies $\{\pi_{\theta_k}\}$ approximating the Pareto front.

3.4 Experimental Design  
Datasets & Simulation Environment  
– Offline: Extract treatment trajectories from a large EHR database for diabetes and hypertension, including patient covariates, actions (dosages), and outcomes.  
– Simulation: Use a validated physiological simulator (e.g., UVA/Padova diabetes simulator) for safe online experimentation.  

Baselines  
– Single‐objective RL with handcrafted scalar reward.  
– Single‐objective PbRL (assumes one weight vector).  
– Multi‐objective RL with fixed weights.  

Evaluation Metrics  
– Hypervolume Indicator (HV): measures the volume dominated by learned policy set relative to a reference point.  
– Inverse Generational Distance (IGD): average distance from true Pareto front.  
– Preference Violation Rate: fraction of clinician feedback pairs for which the recommended policy contradicts inferred preferences.  
– Clinical metrics: mean A1C reduction, side‐effect incidence, cost per patient, aggregated quality‐of‐life improvements.  
– Sample efficiency: number of clinician queries needed to reach satisfactory Pareto approximation.  

Protocol  
1. Offline phase: train MO‐PbRL on historical data without clinician queries to warm‐start $p(w)$.  
2. Online preference elicitation: in simulated sessions, query a panel of clinicians (or simulated oracles fitted to literature) for pairwise preferences until convergence.  
3. Evaluate the learned policy set on held‐out patient trajectories and simulated patients. Compare to baselines on HV, IGD, and clinical metrics.  
4. Sensitivity analysis: vary dimension $d$, number of queries, prior choices, and noise in clinician feedback.

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Expected Outcomes  
• A validated MO‐PbRL algorithm that efficiently approximates the Pareto front of clinical treatment policies using preference feedback.  
• A posterior over weight vectors reflecting clinician trade‐offs, enabling on‐demand extraction of policies for different patient priorities (e.g., cost‐sensitive, risk‐averse).  
• Demonstrated improvements in hypervolume and lower preference‐violation rates compared to single‐objective and fixed‐weight baselines, with better clinical performance (e.g., improved A1C reduction at acceptable side‐effect levels).  
• A set of open‐source tools and code for MO‐PbRL in healthcare, including data preprocessing, preference‐elicitation interface, and RL training pipelines.  

Broader Impact  
• Personalized Medicine: Enables decision support systems that tailor treatment policies to individual patient preferences and clinical expertise without requiring explicit numerical weighting of objectives.  
• Interpretability & Trust: By maintaining a diverse set of Pareto‐optimal policies and a posterior over preferences, clinicians can inspect trade‐offs and understand why a policy is recommended, fostering trust and facilitating adoption.  
• Generalizability: The framework can be applied beyond chronic disease management to other multi‐objective domains such as oncology dosing, critical‐care ventilator settings, and resource allocation in public health.  
• Scientific Contribution: Advances the state of theory and practice in multi‐objective RL, preference learning, and human‐in‐the‐loop AI, offering algorithms with provable convergence properties and empirical sample‐efficiency gains.
