**Title:** Physics-Informed Deep Learning for Enhanced Tumor Growth Prediction in Oncology  

**Motivation:** Accurate tumor growth modeling is critical for personalized cancer treatment but remains challenging due to biological complexity and inter-patient variability. Traditional biophysical models (e.g., reaction-diffusion equations) offer mechanistic insights but struggle to capture real-world heterogeneity. Conversely, data-driven ML models often fail to generalize due to limited, noisy clinical data. Combining these paradigms could preserve scientific interpretability while improving predictive accuracy in dynamic, data-scarce scenarios.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a hybrid framework integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with multi-modal MRI data to model tumor growth. The approach embeds biophysical equations (e.g., diffusion, proliferation) as differentiable constraints within a deep learning architecture, enabling the model to learn patient-specific parameters while respecting physical laws. A key innovation involves adaptive weighting of physics-based loss terms to balance data fidelity and model adherence, addressing discrepancies between idealized equations and real-world imaging variability. The model will be trained on longitudinal MRI datasets, incorporating apparent diffusion coefficient maps and contrast-enhancement patterns to predict spatiotemporal tumor evolution. Expected outcomes include improved prediction accuracy for treatment response and recurrence, reduced reliance on large annotated datasets, and interpretable parameter estimation (e.g., proliferation rates). This work aims to bridge the gap between mechanistic oncology models and clinical data, enabling robust decision support for adaptive radiotherapy and personalized intervention planning. The frameworkâ€™s success could set a precedent for hybrid modeling in other precision medicine applications.
