**1. Title:** **Neural-Symbolic Theorem Generation via Guided Exploration and Formal Verification using Reinforcement Learning**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Mathematical reasoning represents a pinnacle of human intellectual achievement, characterized by its rigor, abstraction, and reliance on formal systems. The quest to imbue artificial intelligence (AI) with similar capabilities has driven significant research within the machine learning community (Workshop Summary). While substantial progress has been made in areas like automated theorem proving (ATP) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9] and autoformalization, the automated *generation* of novel, interesting, and formally valid mathematical theorems remains a challenging frontier [6, 8, 10]. Existing approaches often struggle to balance creative exploration—the synthesis of potentially groundbreaking conjectures—with the stringent requirement of logical soundness within a formal mathematical framework.

Purely neural approaches, such as large language models adapted for mathematics [6, 10], can demonstrate fluency and generate syntactically plausible statements, but often lack guarantees of logical validity or semantic correctness. They may reproduce patterns from training data without genuine mathematical insight or generate trivial variations of known theorems. Conversely, traditional symbolic methods, while ensuring rigor, typically lack the generative flexibility and pattern recognition capabilities of neural networks, often relying on predefined templates or heuristics. The integration of these paradigms, leveraging the strengths of both neural pattern matching and symbolic logical reasoning, presents a promising avenue [8].

Furthermore, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in sequential decision-making problems with sparse rewards, including navigating the complex search spaces involved in *proving* theorems [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9]. Applying RL to *generate* theorems, where the reward signal can be directly tied to the formal validity of the generated statement as determined by an ATP, offers a compelling mechanism for steering generative models towards correctness. However, ensuring novelty and mathematical significance beyond mere validity requires additional guidance.

This research addresses the critical need for AI systems capable of contributing meaningfully to mathematical discovery by generating high-quality, formally verified theorems. We posit that a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture, guided by reinforcement learning with feedback from an ATP and contextual information from a mathematical knowledge graph, can effectively navigate the trade-off between creativity and correctness, leading to the generation of non-trivial, verifiable mathematical statements.

**2.2 Research Objectives**
This research aims to develop and evaluate a novel framework, termed **NeuSyT-RL (Neural-Symbolic Theorem generation with Reinforcement Learning)**, for automated theorem generation. The primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Architecture:** Design and implement a system integrating a neural language model (Transformer-based) for generating theorem candidates, a symbolic Automated Theorem Prover (ATP) for validation, symbolic logic constraints for ensuring basic well-formedness, and a mathematical knowledge graph (KG) for contextual guidance and novelty assessment.
2.  **Implement an RL-based Generation Strategy:** Formulate the theorem generation process as an RL problem where the neural generator acts as the policy network. Utilize the ATP's verification outcome (valid, invalid, timeout) as the primary reward signal to train the generator to produce formally valid statements.
3.  **Integrate Knowledge Graph Guidance:** Leverage a KG representing mathematical concepts and their relationships to steer the generation process towards potentially interesting and novel areas, moving beyond simple variations of existing theorems. Use KG structure to inform the RL state representation or reward function.
4.  **Enforce Symbolic Constraints:** Incorporate lightweight symbolic checks (e.g., type consistency, variable scope rules) as a pre-filter before invoking the computationally expensive ATP, improving efficiency and ensuring basic logical structure.
5.  **Develop Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics:** Define and apply a suite of metrics to assess the generated theorems based on:
    *   **Logical Validity:** Percentage verifiable by an ATP.
    *   **Novelty:** Measured against the training corpus and known theorems using syntactic, semantic, and KG-based distance metrics.
    *   **Interestingness/Significance:** Assessed through potential connections implied by the KG and qualitative evaluation by human mathematical experts.
6.  **Validate Experimentally:** Empirically evaluate the NeuSyT-RL framework on established formal mathematical libraries (e.g., subsets of Lean's `mathlib` or Coq libraries), comparing its performance against baseline methods.

**2.3 Significance**
This research holds significant potential for advancing the field of AI for mathematics and beyond:

1.  **Accelerating Mathematical Discovery:** By automating the generation of plausible and verifiable hypotheses (theorems), NeuSyT-RL could serve as a powerful tool for mathematicians, suggesting new research directions and potentially uncovering unforeseen connections between mathematical concepts. This directly addresses the workshop theme of automated theorem generation.
2.  **Enhancing Human-AI Collaboration in Mathematics:** The system is envisioned not as a replacement for human mathematicians, but as a collaborative partner, handling the generation and initial verification of candidate theorems, freeing up human researchers for deeper conceptual analysis and proof intuition.
3.  **Advancing Neural-Symbolic Integration:** This work contributes to the growing field of neurosymbolic AI by providing a concrete methodology for integrating neural generation capabilities with symbolic reasoning rigor in the complex domain of formal mathematics. It addresses the key challenge of integrating these methods [Lit Review Challenge 3].
4.  **Improving Formal Methods and Verification:** Techniques developed for generating valid theorems could potentially be adapted to generate useful lemmas or specifications for formal verification tasks, or even synthesize provably correct code snippets, linking to other workshop themes (Formal verification and code generation).
5.  **Understanding Machine Creativity and Reasoning:** Investigating how a system can generate novel yet rigorously correct outputs provides valuable insights into the nature of creativity and reasoning within formal constraints, potentially applicable to other scientific or engineering domains requiring structured innovation.
6.  **Addressing Key ATG Challenges:** The proposed framework directly tackles identified challenges such as ensuring logical validity [Challenge 1], balancing creativity and correctness [Challenge 2], and developing meaningful evaluation metrics [Challenge 5].

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Research Design**
The core of this research is the design, implementation, and evaluation of the NeuSyT-RL framework. This framework follows a generate-validate-learn loop, orchestrated by an RL agent.

**3.2 Data Collection and Preparation**
*   **Corpora:** We will utilize established formal mathematical libraries, primarily focusing on Lean's `mathlib` due to its size and active development, or potentially Coq's standard library and associated projects like CoqGym [2]. Subsets focused on specific mathematical domains (e.g., abstract algebra, basic topology, number theory) will be selected for focused experiments.
*   **Preprocessing:** Theorems, definitions, axioms, and potentially proof structures will be extracted from the chosen libraries. These formal statements will be parsed and converted into a standardized sequence format suitable for input to a Transformer model (e.g., S-expressions tokenized, or a linearized representation). Data will be split into training, validation, and testing sets, ensuring no overlap in theorem statements between sets to properly evaluate novelty.

**3.3 NeuSyT-RL Framework Components**

1.  **Neural Theorem Candidate Generator (Policy Network):**
    *   **Architecture:** A Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence or decoder-only model (e.g., similar to GPT or BART) will be employed. It takes a context (e.g., relevant definitions, axioms, existing related theorems, potentially encoded KG information) as input and generates a candidate theorem statement $T_{cand}$ as a sequence of formal tokens.
    *   **Initialization:** The generator will be pre-trained on the preprocessed formal mathematics corpus using self-supervised learning objectives (e.g., masked language modeling, next statement prediction) to learn the syntax, semantics, and common patterns of formal mathematical language. This initialization provides a strong baseline policy for the RL phase.

2.  **Symbolic Validator (Reward Function):**
    *   **Component:** An automated theorem prover (ATP) compatible with the chosen formal language (e.g., Lean's internal tactic framework, external provers like Vampire, E-prover, or Z3, potentially interfaced via systems like `auto` or sledgehammer-like tools).
    *   **Function:** Given a generated candidate theorem $T_{cand}$ and relevant axioms/definitions from the library context, the ATP attempts to prove its validity (i.e., derive it from the axioms) or disprove it (i.e., prove its negation, showing inconsistency) within a predefined time limit $\tau_{ATP}$.
    *   **Reward Signal ($R$):** The outcome of the ATP provides the primary reward signal for the RL agent. A possible reward scheme is:
        $$
        R(T_{cand}) =
        \begin{cases}
        +1.0 & \text{if } T_{cand} \text{ is proved valid by ATP within } \tau_{ATP} \\
        -1.0 & \text{if } T_{cand} \text{ is proved invalid (contradiction) by ATP within } \tau_{ATP} \\
        -0.1 & \text{if ATP times out or returns unknown} \\
        -0.5 & \text{if } T_{cand} \text{ fails basic symbolic constraint checks (see below)}
        \end{cases}
        $$
        Refinements could include bonus rewards for novelty or penalties for triviality (discussed below).

3.  **Symbolic Logic Constraints (Pre-Filter):**
    *   **Function:** Before invoking the potentially slow ATP, lightweight symbolic checks will be applied to $T_{cand}$. These include:
        *   Syntactic correctness (parsability according to the formal language grammar).
        *   Type checking (ensuring terms are used consistently with their defined types).
        *   Variable binding validation (checking for free variables, correct scoping).
    *   **Integration:** Candidates failing these checks receive a significant penalty (e.g., $R = -0.5$) and do not proceed to the ATP, saving computational resources.

4.  **Knowledge Graph (KG) Integration (State/Reward/Exploration Guidance):**
    *   **Construction:** A graph $G = (V, E)$ will be constructed from the formal library, where nodes $v \in V$ represent mathematical concepts, definitions, axioms, and theorems. Edges $e \in E$ represent relationships like `depends_on`, `implies`, `uses_definition`, `is_instance_of`. Graph embedding techniques (e.g., TransE, Graph Attention Networks) might be used to learn vector representations $\mathbf{h}_v$ for each node.
    *   **Guidance Mechanisms:**
        *   *Context Selection:* Use the KG to select relevant context (axioms, definitions, related theorems) to feed into the neural generator, potentially focusing on areas with high "potential energy" for new connections.
        *   *State Augmentation:* Include information derived from the KG (e.g., embeddings of context concepts, graph distance features) in the RL state $s_t$.
        *   *Novelty/Interestingness Reward Bonus:* Augment the primary reward $R$ with a bonus $R_{novelty}$. This bonus could be proportional to the distance (syntactic, semantic embedding, or KG path length) of the valid $T_{cand}$ from existing theorems in the training set and the KG. It could also reward theorems connecting previously distant concepts in the KG.
            $$ R_{total} = R(T_{cand}) + \lambda_{novelty} R_{novelty}(T_{cand}, G, \text{KnownTheorems}) $$
            where $\lambda_{novelty}$ is a hyperparameter balancing validity and novelty.
        *   *Exploration Strategy:* Use KG structure to guide exploration in the RL process, prioritizing generation attempts related to less-explored or highly-connected concepts.

**3.4 Reinforcement Learning Framework**
*   **Formalism:** The theorem generation task is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
*   **State ($s_t$):** Represents the current context for generation. Encodes information such as: recently generated valid theorems, current mathematical topic/concepts under focus (potentially selected via KG), relevant axioms and definitions, possibly KG embeddings.
*   **Action ($a_t$):** The act of generating a complete theorem candidate sequence $T_{cand}$ using the neural generator $\pi_\theta$.
*   **Policy ($\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)$):** The probability distribution over possible theorem sequences, parameterized by the weights $\theta$ of the Transformer model. $\pi_\theta(T_{cand}|s_t)$.
*   **Learning Algorithm:** We will primarily use Policy Gradient methods suitable for large action spaces and sequence generation, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) due to its stability and sample efficiency. The objective is to maximize the expected total reward $\mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta} [\sum_{t} \gamma^t R_{total}(s_t, a_t)]$, where $\tau$ is a generation trajectory and $\gamma$ is a discount factor. The policy network $\theta$ is updated based on the rewards obtained from the symbolic validator and KG assessment. We may also explore connections to Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) [1] for exploring the generation space if viewing theorem construction as a structured search.

**3.5 Overall Algorithm Flow**

1.  **Initialization:** Pre-train the neural generator $\pi_\theta$ on the formal corpus. Construct the initial KG $G$.
2.  **RL Training Loop (Iterate for $N$ episodes):**
    a.  **Select Context:** Choose a starting context $s_0$, potentially guided by an exploration strategy using the KG (e.g., focusing on a specific under-explored subfield).
    b.  **Generate Candidate:** Sample a theorem candidate $T_{cand}$ from the policy $\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)$.
    c.  **Apply Constraints:** Perform lightweight symbolic checks. If $T_{cand}$ fails, assign penalty $R_{constraint}$, record ($s_t, a_t, R_{constraint}$), and proceed to update.
    d.  **Validate with ATP:** If constraints pass, submit $T_{cand}$ to the ATP. Obtain reward $R_{ATP}$ based on validity outcome (proof found, disproof found, timeout).
    e.  **Assess Novelty/Interest:** If $T_{cand}$ is valid, evaluate its novelty $R_{novelty}$ using KG and comparison to known theorems. Calculate the total reward $R_{total} = R_{ATP} + \lambda_{novelty} R_{novelty}$.
    f.  **Store Experience:** Record the transition tuple ($s_t, a_t, R_{total}, s_{t+1}$). Note: In this setup, an episode might consist of generating a single theorem, so $s_{t+1}$ might be a newly selected context.
    g.  **Update Policy:** Periodically update the policy parameters $\theta$ using the collected experiences and the chosen RL algorithm (e.g., PPO).
    h.  **Update KG (Optional):** If a valid and novel theorem is found, add it to the set of known theorems and potentially update the KG structure or embeddings.

**3.6 Experimental Design**
*   **Datasets:** Subsets of Lean `mathlib` (e.g., algebra, real analysis) and potentially Coq libraries.
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  *Pre-trained Transformer Generator:* The neural generator after pre-training but without RL fine-tuning. Generate candidates and filter using ATP post-hoc. [Ref 6, 10]
    2.  *Random Generator + ATP Filter:* Generate random (but syntactically plausible) statements and filter using ATP.
    3.  *Existing Neural-Symbolic ATG:* Compare against methods like [Ref 8] if implementations are available or reproducible.
    4.  *Ablation Studies:* Evaluate versions of NeuSyT-RL with specific components removed (e.g., no KG guidance, no symbolic constraints, no RL - equivalent to Baseline 1, simpler reward function without novelty bonus).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   *Validity Rate:* % of generated statements proven valid by ATP.
    *   *Novelty Score:* Average distance (syntactic: e.g., 1-BLEU/ROUGE vs training data; semantic: embedding cosine distance; KG-based: path length to nearest existing theorem) of valid generated theorems. Requires careful calibration.
    *   *Interestingness Score:* Qualitative rating by 2-3 human experts (mathematicians familiar with the domain) on a Likert scale (e.g., 1-5) assessing potential significance, elegance, non-triviality. Inter-rater reliability will be measured.
    *   *Generation Yield:* Number of valid and novel theorems generated per fixed computational budget (e.g., GPU hours).
    *   *Proof Success Rate Linkage:* Assess if generated theorems are useful as lemmas by attempting to use them to prove established benchmark theorems that were previously unprovable or hard for the baseline ATP.
*   **Implementation Details:** Specify key hyperparameters (learning rates, Transformer size, ATP time limit $\tau_{ATP}$, novelty weight $\lambda_{novelty}$, PPO parameters) and software frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Lean/Coqpy interfaces).

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**
