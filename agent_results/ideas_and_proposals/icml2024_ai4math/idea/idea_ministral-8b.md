### Title: Enhancing Autoformalization Precision with Multi-Modal Learning

### Motivation
The precision of autoformalization from natural language proofs to formal proofs is crucial for reliable mathematical reasoning. Current methods often struggle with the nuances and ambiguities of natural language, leading to errors in formal proofs. Improving this precision can significantly enhance the collaboration between AI and humans in mathematical discovery and verification.

### Main Idea
To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal learning approach that integrates natural language processing (NLP) with symbolic reasoning. The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse dataset of natural language proofs and their corresponding formal proofs.
2. **Preprocessing**: Use NLP techniques to tokenize and parse the natural language proofs into a structured format.
3. **Symbolic Integration**: Develop a symbolic reasoning module that can interpret the structured natural language proofs and generate intermediate mathematical expressions.
4. **Neural Network Training**: Train a neural network on the combined dataset of natural language proofs and their formal representations to learn the mapping between the two.
5. **Evaluation and Refinement**: Continuously evaluate the model's performance and refine it using techniques like back-translation and active learning to improve precision.

Expected Outcomes:
- A more accurate and reliable autoformalization process.
- Enhanced collaboration between AI and human mathematicians.
- Potential applications in automated theorem proving, code generation, and formal verification.

Potential Impact:
This research can significantly advance the field of AI for Math by providing a more precise and reliable method for autoformalization. It can lead to breakthroughs in automated theorem proving, formal verification, and the development of provably correct code. Furthermore, it can facilitate the integration of AI in various scientific and educational domains, making mathematical reasoning more accessible and efficient.
