# Regulation-Sensitive Dynamic Differential Privacy for Federated Learning  

## Introduction  

### Background  
The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) systems has been fueled by access to vast quantities of data, yet this dependence raises significant privacy concerns. Regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA) mandate strict data protection frameworks, classifying data into risk categories (e.g., "special categories" under GDPR Article 9). However, traditional differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) frameworks apply a uniform privacy budget (ε) across all data dimensions, resulting in suboptimal utility-privacy trade-offs: benign features suffer unnecessary noise corruption, while sensitive attributes may receive inadequate protection. This misalignment hampers the adoption of privacy-preserving ML in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance, where both regulatory compliance and model performance are critical.  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a **Regulation-Sensitive Dynamic Differential Privacy for Federated Learning (RS-DP-FL)** framework that:  
1. **Automatically classifies feature sensitivity** using metadata and lightweight natural language processing (NLP) to align with legal risk tiers (e.g., GDPR "special categories").  
2. **Dynamically allocates per-feature ε budgets** to prioritize noise injection on legally sensitive attributes while minimizing utility loss on low-risk features.  
3. **Implements secure aggregation mechanisms** to enforce tailored privacy budgets in federated settings.  
4. **Generates immutable audit logs** to validate compliance with accountability clauses in privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR Article 5.2).  

### Significance  
By bridging technical and regulatory perspectives, RS-DP-FL addresses three critical gaps:  
1. **Legal Alignment**: Ensures proportional protection of high-risk data (e.g., race, health status) as mandated by GDPR.  
2. **Utility Maximization**: Achieves superior model performance compared to uniform DP baselines under equal total ε.  
3. **Auditability**: Provides verifiable compliance through tamper-proof training logs, satisfying regulatory "accountability" and "transparency" principles.  

This work directly responds to challenges identified in recent literature, including the inefficiency of uniform DP (Shahrzad et al., 2025), data heterogeneity in FL (Mengchu et al., 2024), and the need for regulation-aware ML (Abhinav et al., 2024).  

## Methodology  

### System Architecture  
RS-DP-FL extends the standard federated learning paradigm (Figure 1) with three novel components:  
1. **Feature Sensitivity Classifier**  
2. **Dynamic Privacy Budget Allocator**  
3. **Compliance-Audit Logger**

### Data Collection and Preparation  
**Datasets**:  
- **Healthcare**: MIMIC-III (clinical records with diagnoses, demographics)  
- **Finance**: Lending Club Loan Data (loan applications with income, credit history)  
Both datasets contain explicit sensitive attributes (e.g., race, medical conditions) and are widely used in regulatory compliance research.  

**Preprocessing**:  
- Remove direct identifiers (names, social security numbers)  
- Discretize categorical variables with sensitivity-aware encoding  
- Normalize continuous features (e.g., income) using differentially private means  

### Feature Sensitivity Classification  
**Input**: Feature metadata (column names, data dictionaries)  
**Output**: Sensitivity score $ s_i \in [0,1] $ for each feature $ i $  

**Algorithm**:  
1. **Rule-Based Tagging**: Map features to GDPR risk categories using regular expressions (e.g., "medical_history" → high risk).  
2. **NLP Classifier**: Fine-tune a lightweight BERT model (DistilBERT-base) on a corpus of 10,000 labeled regulatory text snippets (e.g., GDPR guidelines, HIPAA rules) to classify free-text metadata.  
   - Loss function: Binary cross-entropy for risk tier prediction  
   - Evaluation metric: F1-score on a held-out validation set of 2,000 labeled examples  

**Final Sensitivity Score**:  
$$ s_i = \alpha \cdot s_i^{\text{rule}} + (1-\alpha) \cdot s_i^{\text{NLP}} $$  
where $ \alpha = 0.7 $ prioritizes rule-based results for legal consistency.  

### Dynamic Privacy Budget Allocation  
**Objective**: Distribute a global privacy target $ \varepsilon_{\text{global}} $ across features to maximize utility while prioritizing sensitive attributes.  

**Approach**:  
1. **Sensitivity Weighting**: Assign baseline budgets proportionally to $ s_i $:  
   $$ \varepsilon_i = \varepsilon_{\text{global}} \cdot \frac{s_i^\gamma}{\sum_{j=1}^d s_j^\gamma} $$  
   where $ \gamma \in [0, \infty) $ controls allocation aggressiveness ($ \gamma=1 $: linear, $ \gamma=2 $: quadratic emphasis on sensitive features).  

2. **Per-Round Adjustment**: Adapt $ \gamma $ during training using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to optimize a weighted objective combining model accuracy and regulatory penalties:  
   $$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{adjusted}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \text{ReLU}(\varepsilon_i - \varepsilon_{\min}) $$  
   where $ \mathcal{S} $ denotes legally mandated high-risk features (e.g., GDPR "special categories") and $ \varepsilon_{\min} $ is the minimum acceptable ε for these features.  

### Secure Aggregation with Dynamic DP  
**Protocol**:  
1. **Client-Side Clipping**: Bound gradient sensitivity for each feature $ i $ by thresholding at $ C_i $:  
   $$ g_i^{\text{clipped}} = \frac{g_i}{\max(1, \|g_i\|_2 / C_i)} $$  
2. **Noise Injection**: Add Gaussian noise scaled to $ \varepsilon_i $:  
   $$ \eta_i \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2 \ln(1.25/\delta) \cdot C_i^2}{\varepsilon_i^2}\right) $$  
   ensuring $ (\varepsilon_i, \delta) $-DP per feature (Dwork & Roth, 2014).  
3. **Secure Aggregation**: Employ Google's cryptographic protocol (Bonawitz et al., 2017) to compute the sum of noisy gradients without revealing individual contributions.  

**Privacy Accounting**: Use the composition theorem to track cumulative ε over $ T $ rounds:  
$$ \varepsilon_{\text{total}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \sqrt{2T \ln(1/\delta)} \cdot \max_i \varepsilon_i^{(t)} $$  

### Audit Logging for Compliance Verification  
**Implementation**:  
- Store immutable records on a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with timestamps and cryptographic hashes of:  
  - Per-round ε allocations $ \varepsilon_i^{(t)} $  
  - Noise magnitudes $ \|\eta_i^{(t)}\|_2 $  
  - Model drift metrics $ \|\theta^{(t+1)} - \theta^{(t)}\|_2 $  
- Enable auditors to verify compliance via a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) system, proving that:  
  $$ \forall i \in \mathcal{S}, \sum_{t=1}^T \varepsilon_i^{(t)} \leq \varepsilon_{\text{max}}^{(i)} $$  
  without exposing raw training data.  

### Experimental Design  
**Baselines**:  
1. Uniform DP-FL: Same $ \varepsilon_i = \varepsilon_{\text{global}}/d $ for all features.  
2. Local DP: Per-client ε without aggregation.  
3. Feature-Subsampled DP: Uniform ε on stochastically subsampled features (Zheng et al., 2023).  

**Hyperparameters**:  
- Global ε ∈ {2, 4, 8}, δ = 10⁻⁵  
- Local epochs = 5, batch size = 32  
- 100 communication rounds with 100 clients (10% sampled per round)  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
| **Category** | **Metrics** | **Tool** |  
|--------------|-------------|----------|  
| Task Utility | Accuracy, F1-macro, AUC-ROC | Scikit-learn |  
| Privacy Cost | Empirical ε, Noise Ratio $ \frac{\|\eta\|_2}{\|g\|_2} $ | PySyft |

- **Finance**: Meet the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) data minimization mandates while optimizing fraud detection models.  

### Long-Term Vision  
This work will:  
1. Inspire regulation-specific DP variants (e.g., HIPAA-compliant FL for the U.S.).  
2. Influence standardization bodies like ISO/IEC to include dynamic ε allocation in privacy-preserving ML guidelines.  
3. Catalyze research on hybrid systems combining DP, encryption, and formal verification for end-to-end compliance.  

## Conclusion  
By dynamically aligning technical privacy mechanisms with legal requirements, RS-DP-FL bridges the gap between ML innovation and regulatory accountability. The proposed framework enables organizations to train high-utility models while demonstrably safeguarding sensitive data—a critical step toward trustworthy AI deployment in GDPR-governed ecosystems.
