# Regulation-Sensitive Dynamic Differential Privacy for Federated Learning: Bridging Compliance and Utility in Data-Driven Learning  

## 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
The widespread adoption of federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data locality. However, privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandate strict controls over sensitive data, requiring "data minimization" and "privacy by design." Traditional differential privacy (DP) applies uniform noise across all features, leading to suboptimal trade-offs: excessive noise degrades utility on benign features, while sensitive attributes remain under-protected. Recent works highlight the need for adaptive DP mechanisms in FL but neglect regulatory alignment, leaving a critical gap between technical implementations and legal requirements.  

**Research Objectives**  
This work proposes *Regulation-Sensitive Dynamic Differential Privacy (RS-DDP)*, a federated learning framework that:  
1. Automatically tags data features by regulatory sensitivity using metadata and NLP classifiers.  
2. Dynamically allocates per-feature privacy budgets ($\epsilon_j$) to align with GDPR risk categories.  
3. Integrates noise injection with secure aggregation and immutable audit logs for compliance verification.  
4. Empirically validates utility gains and regulatory adherence in healthcare and financial applications.  

**Significance**  
RS-DDP bridges the gap between DP theory and regulatory practice. By prioritizing privacy budgets on legally sensitive features, it maximizes model performance while satisfying accountability clauses in GDPR, DMA, and similar frameworks. This paves the way for scalable, regulation-compliant FL systems in high-stakes domains.  

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 System Design  
RS-DDP operates in four stages (Fig. 1):  
1. **Regulatory Sensitivity Tagging**: Metadata and feature descriptions are analyzed using lightweight NLP models to classify features into sensitivity tiers (e.g., "high," "medium," "low") based on GDPR Article 9 criteria (e.g., health data, biometrics).  
2. **Adaptive $\epsilon$-Budget Allocation**: A scoring function maps sensitivity tiers to initial privacy budgets, dynamically adjusted during training via gradient-based importance signals.  
3. **Noise Injection via Secure Aggregator**: Clients compute model updates locally; a cryptographic secure aggregator applies tailored Laplace noise per feature.  
4. **Audit Log Generation**: Each training round’s $\epsilon_j$ values, noise scales, and aggregated gradients are hashed into a blockchain ledger for third-party verification.  

### 2.2 Algorithmic Framework  
**Sensitivity Tagging**  
A pre-trained transformer model (e.g., BERT) processes feature metadata (names, descriptions) to predict sensitivity scores $s_j \in [0, 1]$ for each feature $j$. Scores are calibrated using regulatory keywords (e.g., "diagnosis," "income") from GDPR guidelines.  

**Dynamic $\epsilon$-Allocation**  
Let $\epsilon_{\text{total}}$ denote the global privacy budget. For each feature $j$:  
$$
\epsilon_j^{(t)} = \frac{\epsilon_{\text{total}} \cdot \phi(s_j^{(t)})}{\sum_{k=1}^d \phi(s_k^{(t)})},
$$  
where $\phi(s_j) = \frac{1}{s_j + \delta}$ reweights sensitivities (adjusting $\delta > 0$ prevents division by zero), and $s_j^{(t)}$ is updated via gradient importance:  
$$
s_j^{(t)} \leftarrow s_j^{(t-1)} + \eta \cdot \|\nabla_{w_j} \mathcal{L}\|_2,
$$  
where $\nabla_{w_j} \mathcal{L}$ is the gradient of the loss $\mathcal{L}$ w.r.t. feature $j$’s weights.  

**Noise Injection**  
The secure aggregator computes the noisy global update for feature $j$ as:  
$$
\Delta \tilde{w}_j = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \Delta w_{j}^{(i)} + \text{Laplace}\left(\frac{\Delta f_j}{\epsilon_j}\right),
$$  
where $m$ is the number of clients, $\Delta f_j$ is the feature-specific sensitivity (maximum gradient norm across clients), and Laplace noise is scaled by $\Delta f_j / \epsilon_j$.  

**DP Guarantees**  
RS-DDP satisfies $(\epsilon_{\text{total}}, \delta)$-DP via parallel composition: since features are disjoint, the total budget is $\epsilon_{\text{total}} = \max_j \epsilon_j$ under parallel composition, though sequential composition (summing $\epsilon_j$) is used for worst-case guarantees.  

### 2.3 Experimental Design  
**Datasets**  
The Basel Breast Cancer (BBC) and Kaggle Credit Fraud datasets are used to represent healthcare and financial domains, respectively. Features are tagged as "high" (e.g., tumor size), "medium" (e.g., age), or "low" sensitivity (e.g., ZIP code).  

**Baselines**  
- **Uniform DP**: Equal $\epsilon_j$ allocation.  
- **Fixed-Tier DP**: Static $\epsilon_j$ based on initial sensitivity tiers.  
- **Non-private FL**: No noise added.  

**Metrics**  
- **Utility**: Accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC.  
- **Privacy**: $\epsilon_{\text{total}}$ expenditure, Renyi-DP bounds.  
- **Compliance**: Percentage of high-sensitivity features with $\epsilon_j \leq \epsilon_{\text{legal}}$, audit log verifiability.  

**Implementation**  
- Clients: PyTorch with Opacus for gradient clipping.  
- Secure Aggregator: TensorFlow Federated with SecAgg.  
- NLP Classifier: HuggingFace’s DistilBERT fine-tuned on GDPR text corpus.  

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

**Anticipated Results**  
- **Utility Gains**: RS-DDP will achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than uniform DP on sensitive datasets (e.g., AUC: 0.92 vs. 0.85 for breast cancer detection).  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: 95% of high-sensitivity features will meet GDPR’s "strictly necessary" privacy thresholds ($\epsilon_j \leq 1.0$), verified via audit logs.  
- **Efficiency**: Dynamic $\epsilon_j$ allocation reduces communication overhead by 40% compared to static tier-based approaches.  

**Impact**  
RS-DDP provides a blueprint for deploying federated learning in regulated industries. By harmonizing DP noise with legal requirements, it enhances transparency, reduces regulatory risks, and preserves model utility. The audit log framework further enables compliance reporting, fostering trust among stakeholders.
