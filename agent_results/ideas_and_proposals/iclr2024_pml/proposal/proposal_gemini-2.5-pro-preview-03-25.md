**1. Title:** **Regulation-Sensitive Dynamic Differential Privacy for Federated Learning: Aligning Algorithmic Privacy with Legal Mandates**

**2. Introduction**

*   **Background:** The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, heavily relies on vast amounts of data. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to train ML models collaboratively across multiple decentralized clients holding local data samples, without explicitly sharing the raw data (McMahan et al., 2017). This inherently offers a degree of privacy by minimizing data movement. However, FL is not immune to privacy breaches; model updates exchanged during training can still inadvertently leak sensitive information about the clients' local data (Nasr et al., 2019). Differential Privacy (DP) (Dwork et al., 2006) has become the gold standard for providing rigorous, mathematically provable privacy guarantees in ML. Standard DP mechanisms, often applied uniformly across all data features or model parameters (Abadi et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2023 - Gboard paper), inject noise calibrated to a global privacy budget ($\epsilon$). While effective in theory, this uniform application often leads to a suboptimal trade-off: either excessive noise is added to non-sensitive features, unnecessarily degrading model utility, or sensitive features receive inadequate protection if the global budget is set too loosely to preserve overall utility. Concurrently, data protection regulations like the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and similar frameworks worldwide (e.g., CCPA, HIPAA) emphasize risk-based approaches. They classify data based on sensitivity (e.g., personal data vs. sensitive personal data like health or financial information) and mandate appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect it (GDPR Art. 32). There is a growing need to bridge the gap between the technical implementation of privacy-preserving ML and the nuanced requirements of these legal frameworks (Xu et al., 2021 - PGU review).

*   **Problem Statement:** The core problem lies in the mismatch between the uniform noise application in conventional DP-FL systems and the heterogeneous sensitivity of data features as recognized by privacy regulations. Applying a single privacy budget ($\epsilon$) across all features fails to account for the varying risks associated with different data types (e.g., age vs. medical diagnosis, zip code vs. financial transaction details). This misalignment can result in:
    1.  **Reduced Model Utility:** Over-protection of non-sensitive features introduces unnecessary noise, hindering the model's ability to learn meaningful patterns, particularly in FL scenarios already challenged by data heterogeneity (Li et al., 2024; Banse et al., 2024).
    2.  **Inadequate Protection:** Sensitive features might not receive sufficient protection if the global $\epsilon$ is chosen primarily to maximize overall utility, potentially violating the spirit, if not the letter, of regulations demanding heightened safeguards for high-risk data.
    3.  **Lack of Granular Compliance Evidence:** Standard DP guarantees ($\epsilon$) do not directly translate into compliance narratives that regulators understand, specifically regarding how *different types* of sensitive data are protected according to their risk level. Demonstrating accountability and adherence to principles like data minimization becomes challenging.

*   **Proposed Solution:** We propose **Regulation-Sensitive Dynamic Differential Privacy for Federated Learning (ReSD-DPFL)**, a novel framework designed to explicitly align DP mechanisms with regulatory sensitivity classifications within an FL setting. The core idea is to dynamically allocate the privacy budget ($\epsilon$) across different features or feature groups based on their legally or contextually defined sensitivity levels. This framework comprises four key components:
    1.  **Automated Sensitivity Tagging:** A mechanism to automatically classify data features based on regulatory risk levels using metadata analysis and lightweight Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
    2.  **Dynamic Budget Allocation:** An algorithm that distributes a global privacy budget (per round or total) across features/groups non-uniformly, assigning tighter budgets (requiring more noise/stronger protection) to more sensitive features.
    3.  **Privacy-Preserving Aggregation:** Integration with FL using a secure aggregation protocol, where the central aggregator enforces the dynamically allocated, feature-specific privacy budgets during the model update process.
    4.  **Immutable Audit Log:** Generation of verifiable logs for each training round, documenting the sensitivity levels identified, the corresponding privacy budgets allocated, and the noise applied, facilitating transparency and regulatory compliance audits.

*   **Research Objectives:** This research aims to:
    1.  Develop and implement an automated feature sensitivity tagging module capable of interpreting metadata and simple data schemas to assign risk categories based on predefined regulatory rules (e.g., GDPR definitions of personal vs. sensitive personal data).
    2.  Design and formalize a dynamic differential privacy budget allocation mechanism that translates feature sensitivity tags into specific $\epsilon_j$ values for each feature (or feature group) $j$, while adhering to an overall privacy budget $\epsilon_{total}$ and respecting DP composition rules.
    3.  Integrate the dynamic allocation mechanism into a standard FL algorithm (e.g., FedAvg) using a secure aggregator, ensuring that noise injection respects the feature-specific budgets without compromising client privacy during aggregation.
    4.  Implement a system for generating immutable audit logs that record the privacy parameters (sensitivity tags, $\epsilon_j$ allocation, noise levels) applied in each training round, suitable for compliance verification.
    5.  Empirically evaluate the ReSD-DPFL framework on realistic datasets (e.g., healthcare, financial) to quantify the improvements in the utility-privacy trade-off compared to baseline uniform DP-FL methods, and assess its effectiveness in meeting regulatory principles like data minimization and accountability.

*   **Significance:** This research addresses a critical gap between principled DP theory and the practical demands of regulatory compliance in real-world FL deployments. By aligning privacy preservation techniques with legal risk assessments, ReSD-DPFL offers several significant benefits:
    *   **Improved Utility-Privacy Trade-off:** It promises higher model accuracy compared to uniform DP for the same overall privacy cost ($\epsilon_{total}$), making privacy-preserving FL more viable for practical applications.
    *   **Enhanced Regulatory Compliance:** Provides a clearer pathway to demonstrating compliance with regulations like GDPR, particularly the principles of risk-based security measures, data minimization, and accountability.
    *   **Increased Trust and Transparency:** The audit log mechanism enhances transparency and allows for independent verification of the privacy measures implemented, fostering greater trust among users, developers, and regulators.
    *   **Practical Applicability:** Focuses on integrating with existing FL frameworks and using computationally feasible methods for tagging and allocation, aiming for practical adoption in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. This directly tackles key challenges identified in the literature, such as balancing privacy/utility, regulatory compliance, and adaptive budget allocation (Xu et al., 2021; Kiani et al., 2025).

**3. Methodology**

This section details the proposed research design, including data, algorithms, experimental setup, and evaluation metrics.

*   **Data Collection and Preparation:**
    *   We will utilize publicly available benchmark datasets that contain features with varying degrees of sensitivity, suitable for simulating healthcare and financial FL scenarios. Potential datasets include:
        *   **Healthcare:** MIMIC-III/IV (requires credentialing, may use publicly available subsets or derived datasets), Synthea generated datasets, or potentially partitioned versions of datasets like the UCI Heart Disease dataset. Features like diagnosis codes, ethnicity, age, specific lab values would be candidates for sensitivity tagging.
        *   **Financial:** LendingClub Loan Data, German Credit Data, or similar datasets containing financial attributes (income, debt ratio, loan purpose, demographics).
    *   **Preprocessing:** Data will be cleaned, preprocessed (e.g., normalization, one-hot encoding), and partitioned to simulate a federated setting. We will explore both IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) and non-IID data distributions across clients, reflecting realistic FL challenges (Kim et al., 2021; Banse et al., 2024). A subset of data will be reserved for testing the final global model.
    *   **Sensitivity Ground Truth:** For evaluation purposes, we will manually annotate features in the chosen datasets with sensitivity levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High) based on GDPR definitions or typical industry risk assessments. This will serve as a ground truth for evaluating the automated tagging module.

*   **Algorithmic Steps:**

    1.  **Feature Sensitivity Tagging Module:**
        *   **Input:** Data schema (column names, data types), potentially sample data values (accessed in a privacy-preserving manner during setup, e.g., via secure sketches or only on representative public data), and a predefined set of regulatory rules/keywords (e.g., lists of sensitive terms based on GDPR Art. 9).
        *   **Methods:**
            *   *Metadata Analysis:* Rules based on column names (e.g., "race", "diagnosis", "religion" -> High Sensitivty; "age", "zip_code" -> Medium; "product_interaction_count" -> Low) and data types (e.g., unique identifiers -> High).
            *   *Lightweight NLP:* For textual or less structured columns, employ simple techniques like keyword matching, regular expressions, or potentially a pre-trained small language model (e.g., spaCy, a fine-tuned DistilBERT) to classify column content against sensitivity definitions. The goal is computational efficiency suitable for FL contexts.
        *   **Output:** A vector of sensitivity scores $S = [s_1, s_2, ..., s_d]$ for the $d$ features, where higher $s_j$ indicates higher sensitivity. This could be categorical (e.g., {1, 2, 3}) or continuous (e.g., [0, 1]).

    2.  **Dynamic Privacy Budget ($\epsilon$) Allocation:**
        *   **Input:** The sensitivity score vector $S$, the total privacy budget for the current round $\epsilon_{round}$ (derived from a global budget $\epsilon_{total}$ and a composition strategy, potentially time-adaptive like Kiani et al., 2025), and potentially information about feature correlations or groupings.
        *   **Mechanism:** We will design an allocation function $\mathcal{A}: (S, \epsilon_{round}) \rightarrow E = [\epsilon_1, ..., \epsilon_d]$ or potentially $[\epsilon_{g_1}, ..., \epsilon_{g_k}]$ for $k$ feature groups. The allocation must satisfy DP composition rules. A potential strategy:
            *   Assign feature weights $w_j$ inversely proportional to desired protection level (e.g., $w_j = 1 / f(s_j)$, where $f$ is an increasing function, perhaps exponential $f(s_j) = \alpha^{s_j}$ with $\alpha > 1$).
            *   Normalize weights and allocate budget:
                $$ \epsilon_j = \epsilon_{round} \cdot \frac{w_j}{\sum_{k=1}^d w_k} $$
            *   This ensures $\sum \epsilon_j = \epsilon_{round}$ (under simple linear composition; adjustments needed for advanced composition or RDP/GDP accountants). We will investigate strategies that account for group sparsity or feature correlations if applicable. The allocation aims to assign *smaller* $\epsilon_j$ (hence more noise) to *more sensitive* features ($s_j$ high).

    3.  **Differentially Private Federated Aggregation:**
        *   We will base our framework on FedAvg. Let $w_t$ be the global model at round $t$. Clients $i \in \{1, ..., N\}$ compute gradients $\nabla L(w_t, D_i)$ on their local data $D_i$.
        *   **Client-Side Clipping:** Each client clips their update $\Delta w_i = \nabla L(w_t, D_i)$. To support feature-level DP, clipping might need to be applied per-feature or per-feature-group:
            $$ \Delta \tilde{w}_{i,j} = \Delta w_{i,j} \cdot \min\left(1, \frac{C_j}{\|\Delta w_{i,j}\|_2}\right) $$
            where $C_j$ is the clipping norm for feature/group $j$. $C_j$ could potentially be linked to sensitivity $s_j$.
        *   **Secure Aggregation:** Clients encrypt/mask their clipped updates $\Delta \tilde{w}_i$ using a secure aggregation protocol (e.g., Bonawitz et al., 2017) and send them to the aggregator.
        *   **Aggregator Noise Injection:** The secure aggregator computes the sum $\Delta W = \sum_{i=1}^N \Delta \tilde{w}_i$. It then retrieves the sensitivity scores $S$ (either pre-shared or computed by the aggregator if it has schema access) and calculates the per-feature budgets $E=[\epsilon_1, ..., \epsilon_d]$ using the dynamic allocation mechanism. The aggregator generates a noise vector $Z = [Z_1, ..., Z_d]$, where each component $Z_j$ corresponds to feature $j$ (or a feature group) and is drawn from a suitable distribution (e.g., Gaussian) calibrated to provide $\epsilon_j$-DP. For Gaussian mechanism:
            $$ Z_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_j^2 I) $$
            where the standard deviation $\sigma_j$ is calculated based on $\epsilon_j$, the global sensitivity (related to $C_j$ and number of clients), and the desired $\delta$ (for $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP). Typically, $\sigma_j \propto C_j / \epsilon_j$.
        *   **Global Model Update:** The aggregator sends the noisy average update $G = \frac{1}{N}(\Delta W + Z)$ to the server. The server updates the model:
            $$ w_{t+1} = w_t - \eta G $$
            where $\eta$ is the learning rate.

    4.  **Audit Log Generation:**
        *   After each round $t$, the aggregator (or a designated logging service interacting with it) records the following information:
            *   Round number $t$, Timestamp.
            *   Identifier of participating clients (or just the count $N$).
            *   Global budget parameters ($\epsilon_{round}$, $\delta$).
            *   Feature sensitivity scores used ($S$).
            *   Allocated per-feature/group budgets ($E = [\epsilon_1, ..., \epsilon_d]$).
            *   Clipping bounds used ($C_j$).
            *   Scale of noise added for each feature/group ($\sigma_j$).
            *   Hash of the final noisy update $G$ or the updated model $w_{t+1}$.
        *   **Immutability:** The log will be designed for tamper-resistance, potentially using cryptographic chaining (hashing previous log entry into the current one) or integrating with a permissioned blockchain.

*   **Experimental Design:**
    *   **Baselines:**
        1.  Standard FedAvg (non-private).
        2.  FedAvg with uniform DP (DP-FedAvg): Applies the *same* total $\epsilon_{round}$ budget uniformly across all features using a standard DP mechanism (e.g., Gaussian noise on the entire aggregated update). Use established methods like DP-FTRL (Xu et al., 2023) or basic DP-FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017 DP extension).
        3.  FedAvg with time-adaptive DP (Kiani et al., 2025): Compare against methods that vary $\epsilon$ over time but not across features.
    *   **Tasks:** Classification or regression tasks relevant to the datasets (e.g., disease prediction, mortality prediction for healthcare; loan approval, default prediction for finance).
    *   **Setup:** Simulate FL with varying numbers of clients (e.g., 10, 50, 100) and data distributions (IID vs. non-IID using Dirichlet partitioning). Train for a fixed number of communication rounds or until convergence. Key hyperparameters (learning rate $\eta$, batch size, local epochs, clipping thresholds $C_j$, total privacy budget $\epsilon_{total}$, $\delta$) will be tuned using a validation set.
    *   **Evaluation:** We will compare ReSD-DPFL against baselines across a range of total privacy budgets $\epsilon_{total}$. For each setting, we will measure:

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Model Utility:** Accuracy, F1-score, Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the held-out global test set. We hypothesize ReSD-DPFL will achieve higher utility than uniform DP-FedAvg for the same $\epsilon_{total}$.
    *   **Privacy Guarantee:** Report the achieved $(\epsilon_{total}, \delta)$-DP guarantee, calculated using appropriate composition theorems (e.g., Moments Accountant / RDP / Gaussian DP Accountant) based on the per-round, per-feature budgets $(\epsilon_j, \delta_j)$. Verify that the mechanism correctly enforces stronger protection (lower $\epsilon_j$) for features tagged as more sensitive.
    *   **Regulatory Alignment (Qualitative & Quantitative):**
        *   *Qualitative:* Assess how well the framework aligns with GDPR principles (Art. 5: data minimization; Art. 25: privacy by design; Art. 32: security of processing; Art. 24/30: accountability). The audit log's structure and content will be evaluated for its usefulness in compliance demonstrations.
        *   *Quantitative:* Measure the effective noise level applied to sensitive vs. non-sensitive features. Analyze if the utility gain primarily comes from better learning on non-sensitive features while maintaining strong protection on sensitive ones.
    *   **Computational and Communication Overhead:** Measure client-side computation time per round, aggregator computation time (including tagging, allocation, noise generation), and communication cost (size of updates, overhead from secure aggregation). Compare this overhead with baseline methods.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

*   **Expected Outcomes:**
    1.  **Demonstration of Improved Utility-Privacy Trade-off:** We expect to demonstrate empirically that ReSD-DPFL achieves significantly higher model utility (potentially reaching the 30% gain hypothesized in the initial idea, under certain conditions) compared to standard uniform DP-FL baselines, given the same overall privacy budget $\epsilon_{total}$, especially on datasets with clear distinctions in feature sensitivity.
    2.  **Validation of Dynamic Budget Allocation:** We anticipate showing that the dynamic allocation mechanism successfully assigns lower $\epsilon_j$ (implying stronger protection) to features identified as sensitive, effectively tailoring the privacy guarantees based on regulatory context.
    3.  **Functional Automated Tagging:** A working prototype of the automated sensitivity tagging module, demonstrating reasonable accuracy in classifying features based on metadata and simple content analysis according to predefined rules.
    4.  **Verifiable Audit Logs:** Generation of immutable audit logs that clearly document the privacy mechanisms applied in each round, providing a practical tool for transparency and compliance reporting.
    5.  **Comparative Analysis:** A comprehensive analysis comparing ReSD-DPFL with baselines regarding utility, privacy guarantees, overhead, and qualitative alignment with regulatory principles. We also expect insights into how factors like data heterogeneity and the number of clients interact with our proposed method.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Scientific Contribution:** This research will contribute a novel approach to DP in FL that integrates domain-specific knowledge (regulatory sensitivity) into the core privacy mechanism. It advances the state-of-the-art beyond uniform or solely time-varying DP budgets, offering a more nuanced and context-aware privacy framework. It will also provide insights into the practical implementation of feature-level DP within secure FL systems.
    *   **Practical Application & Industry Relevance:** The ReSD-DPFL framework aims to make privacy-preserving FL more practical and attractive for organizations operating in regulated sectors like healthcare, finance, and insurance. By potentially improving model utility without compromising compliance, it can accelerate the adoption of FL for analyzing sensitive datasets, unlocking value while respecting user privacy and legal obligations.
    *   **Regulatory Compliance and Trust:** The framework provides a concrete technical implementation aligned with the risk-based approach advocated by regulations like GDPR. The audit log feature directly addresses the need for accountability and transparency, potentially simplifying compliance audits and increasing user and regulator trust in FL systems.
    *   **Bridging Communities:** This work aligns perfectly with the goals of the "Privacy Regulation and Protection in Machine Learning" workshop by bringing together technical DP/FL methods with non-technical regulatory requirements, fostering interdisciplinary understanding and solutions.

In conclusion, ReSD-DPFL aims to provide a more effective, compliant, and trustworthy approach to privacy preservation in federated learning by dynamically adapting differential privacy guarantees to the regulatory sensitivity of data features, thereby advancing both the theory and practice of privacy-preserving machine learning.
