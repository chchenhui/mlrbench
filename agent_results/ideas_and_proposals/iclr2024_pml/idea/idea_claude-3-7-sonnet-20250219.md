# Privacy-Preserving Fine-tuning for Large Language Models

## Motivation
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become central to AI advancement, but fine-tuning these models on sensitive data creates significant privacy risks. Traditional approaches like federated learning or differential privacy often result in performance degradation when applied to LLMs. As regulators enforce stricter compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR, there's an urgent need for methods that maintain both privacy and utility in the context of LLM fine-tuning, especially when using personal or proprietary data.

## Main Idea
I propose a hybrid approach combining selective parameter fine-tuning with local differential privacy for LLM adaptation. This method introduces a two-phase process: first, identifying the minimal subset of model parameters that require updating for a specific downstream task using sensitivity analysis; second, applying targeted noise injection only to these parameters during distributed fine-tuning. By limiting privacy-preserving operations to task-critical parameters, we can maintain a better privacy-utility tradeoff than applying differential privacy broadly. Additionally, the framework includes a privacy budget allocation mechanism that dynamically adjusts privacy guarantees based on parameter importance and data sensitivity levels. This approach would enable organizations to fine-tune LLMs on sensitive data while providing provable privacy guarantees compatible with GDPR requirements, potentially unlocking new applications in healthcare, legal services, and personalized education.
