**Title:** Scalable Differential Privacy for Large Language Models via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning  

**Motivation:** Large language models (LLMs) risk memorizing sensitive training data, violating privacy regulations like GDPR. Applying differential privacy (DP) to LLMs is challenging due to their scale, as traditional DP methods (e.g., DP-SGD) incur high computational and utility costs. Addressing this gap is critical to enable privacy-compliant LLMs in domains like healthcare and finance.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes integrating DP with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., LoRA, adapters) to enforce privacy guarantees during LLM adaptation. Instead of applying DP to all parameters, noise and gradient clipping would be restricted to low-rank adapter modules or sparse updates, drastically reducing computational overhead. The methodology includes theoretical analysis to bound privacy loss and empirical evaluation of trade-offs between privacy budgets (ε), utility, and efficiency across tasks (e.g., text generation, classification). Expected outcomes: (1) A scalable DP-PEFT framework with formal privacy guarantees, (2) benchmarks showing minimal accuracy drops (<5%) at ε ≤ 5, and (3) open-source tools for auditable DP compliance. This could democratize privacy-preserving LLMs while aligning with legal requirements.
