### Title: "Dynamic Feedback Loops in Human-Algorithm Interaction: A Multi-Agent System Approach"

### Motivation:
The increasing reliance on machine learning algorithms in decision-making processes has led to a complex interplay between humans and algorithms. This interaction often forms feedback loops, where human behavior influences algorithmic decisions, which in turn affect human behavior. Understanding and modeling these feedback loops is crucial for mitigating potential negative societal impacts, such as polarization and inequality. Existing models often fail to capture the dynamic nature of these interactions, leading to suboptimal algorithm design and societal outcomes.

### Main Idea:
This research proposes a novel multi-agent system (MAS) framework to model dynamic feedback loops between human and algorithmic decision-making. The framework will incorporate elements of game theory and network science to capture strategic and emergent behaviors. The MAS will consist of multiple agents representing both humans and algorithms, each with its own utility function and decision-making strategy. The agents will interact within a dynamic environment, where their behaviors and preferences evolve over time.

The methodology will involve the following steps:
1. **Agent Design**: Define the characteristics and behaviors of human and algorithmic agents, including their utility functions and decision-making strategies.
2. **Environment Simulation**: Create a simulated environment where agents can interact and evolve over time.
3. **Feedback Loop Modeling**: Develop a model to capture the feedback loops between human and algorithmic decisions, accounting for both rational and non-rational behaviors.
4. **Impact Analysis**: Analyze the long-term impacts of these interactions on societal outcomes using metrics such as social mobility, mental health, and polarization.

Expected outcomes include:
- A comprehensive MAS framework that can simulate complex interactions between humans and algorithms.
- Insights into the long-term impacts of these interactions on societal outcomes.
- Improved algorithms that can adapt to and mitigate negative feedback loops.

Potential impact:
This research can inform the design of more equitable and fair algorithms, helping to address societal challenges such as polarization and inequality. It can also contribute to the broader understanding of human-algorithm interactions, fostering a more responsible and ethical use of machine learning in society.
