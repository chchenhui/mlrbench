Title: FairFlow – A Mean-Field Game Framework for Dynamic Fairness under Strategic Behavior

Motivation:  
Algorithmic decision-making in high-stakes domains (e.g., credit scoring, hiring) often induces feedback loops: disadvantaged groups adapt strategically, potentially exacerbating disparities over time. Static fairness metrics fail to capture these emergent dynamics, leaving long-term disparate impacts unaddressed. A principled, scalable framework is needed to model and mitigate dynamic unfairness arising from both algorithmic updates and strategic human responses.

Main Idea:  
We propose FairFlow, a mean-field game (MFG) model coupling a population of strategic agents with an adaptive decision-maker under fairness constraints.  
• Agents: Partitioned into demographic cohorts, each agent selects feature manipulation strategies to maximize a time-discounted utility that trades off true qualification vs. manipulation cost.  
• Decision-Maker: Employs constrained reinforcement learning to update policies that optimize overall performance while enforcing group-level parity constraints (e.g., equalized improvement rates).  
• Equilibrium Analysis: Derive existence and uniqueness conditions for mean-field equilibria, characterizing how fairness constraints influence agent strategies and long-term group outcomes.  
• Empirical Validation: Simulations on synthetic and real lending datasets to demonstrate reduction of cumulative disparate impact, robustness to strategic manipulation, and policy interpretability.  

Expected Impact: FairFlow delivers a theoretical and algorithmic toolkit for sustaining fairness in dynamic socio-technical systems, guiding policy design that anticipates and counters strategic adaptation.
