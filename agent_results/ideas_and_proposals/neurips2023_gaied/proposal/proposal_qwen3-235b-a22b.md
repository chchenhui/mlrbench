# **Generative AI as a Socratic Learning Partner for Collaborative Inquiry**

## **Introduction**

### **Background**
The advent of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized education, enabling new forms of human-machine collaboration. While AI tutors like ChatGPT excel at delivering factual answers, they often fail to foster critical thinking and reflective learning—a gap that mirrors the historical role of Socratic dialogue in education. Socratic methods, which emphasize probing questions and guided exploration, have been shown to enhance metacognitive skills and conceptual understanding. However, scaling such personalized interactions remains a challenge due to resource constraints. Recent systems like SocratiQ, SPL, and EduChat have explored generative AI for Socratic-style tutoring but face limitations in simulating authentic peer-like interactions, personalization, and robust evaluation frameworks. This proposal addresses these gaps by designing an AI agent that functions as a *collaborative peer* rather than an authoritative tutor, prioritizing dialogue-driven inquiry over solution provision.

### **Research Objectives**
1. **Develop an LLM-based Socratic agent**: Create a generative AI agent that employs fine-tuning and advanced prompting to simulate peer-like Socratic dialogue, focusing on question generation, assumption challenging, and metacognitive stimulation.  
2. **Personalize interaction dynamics**: Enable the agent to adapt its dialogue strategies to individual students' reasoning patterns, subject proficiency, and cognitive preferences.  
3. **Validate pedagogical effectiveness**: Quantify the agent’s impact on students’ ability to articulate reasoning, self-correct, and engage in reflective problem-solving compared to traditional AI tutors.  
4. **Establish evaluation metrics**: Define frameworks for assessing the quality of Socratic dialogue in AI systems, integrating linguistic analysis, metacognitive indicators, and domain-specific benchmarks.

### **Significance**
This research aligns with the GAIED workshop’s dual thrusts (GAI→ED and ED→GAI). By advancing AI-driven collaborative learning (GAI→ED), it offers a scalable solution for fostering critical thinking, a skill critical for 21st-century education. Simultaneously, it tackles ED→GAI challenges by redirecting AI’s focus from answer provision to cognitive scaffolding, mitigating risks of algorithmic dependency. The outcomes will inform technical innovations in dialogue systems and pedagogical design, contributing to equitable, AI-enhanced education.

## **Methodology**

### **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
**1. Dataset Acquisition:**  
A dataset of Socratic dialogues will be curated from three sources:  
- Publicly available educational transcripts (e.g., MOOCs, tutoring sessions).  
- Annotated dialogues from existing systems like SPL and SocratiQ.  
- Collaborations with educators to generate subject-specific dialogues in STEM and humanities.  

**2. Preprocessing:**  
- **Anonymization & Annotation**: Remove personal identifiers and tag dialogues with metadata (e.g., subject, grade level, reasoning type).  
- **Dialogue Categorization**: Segment dialogues into pedagogical phases (problem framing, hypothesis testing, reflection).  
- **Splitting**: Allocate 70% of data to training, 15% to validation, and 15% to testing.

### **Model Selection & Architecture**
The system will be built using **LLaMA-3-8B** as the base model, chosen for its balance of scale and adaptability. Key components include:  
1. **Prompt Engineering Module**:  
   - Role-specific prompts (e.g., "You are a curious peer exploring this problem. Ask questions to clarify my understanding.").  
   - Few-shot examples demonstrating Socratic patterns (e.g., "What assumptions are we making here?", "Can you think of a counterexample?").  
   - Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts to scaffold multi-step reasoning.  

2. **Fine-Tuning Pipeline**:  
   - **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Train on annotated dialogues where inputs are student utterances and labels are Socratic responses. Loss function:  
     $$
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{SFT}} = -\sum_{t=1}^T \log p_{\theta}(y_t | x, y_{1:t-1})
     $$
     where $ x $ is input dialogue history, $ y_t $ is the target response token, and $ T $ is sequence length.  
   - **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to maximize rewards for questions that elicit detailed explanations. The reward function $ R_t $ is defined as:  
     $$
     R_t = \alpha \cdot Q_{\text{score}} + \beta \cdot C_{\text{score}} + \gamma \cdot M_{\text{score}}
     $$
     where $ Q_{\text{score}} $ evaluates question quality (openness, relevance), $ C_{\text{score}} $ measures content accuracy, and $ M_{\text{score}} $ assesses metacognitive stimulation.  

### **Socratic Interaction Design**
The agent’s dialogue manager follows an iterative loop:  
1. **Problem Framing**: Prompt the student with a scenario (e.g., "Solve this physics problem collaboratively.").  
2. **Question Generation**: Generate a Socratic question using the model.  
3. **Student Response Analysis**: Use a classifier to assess the response’s reasoning depth (e.g., "surface-level" vs. "analytical").  
4. **Adaptive Strategy**: Adjust subsequent questions based on analysis—e.g., request clarification for vague answers or pose follow-ups to extend analysis.  

### **Experimental Design & Evaluation**
**1. User Studies:**  
- **Participants**: 200 students (grades 9–12 and undergraduates) divided into two cohorts:  
  - **Control Group**: Interacts with a traditional AI tutor (e.g., Khan Academy’s chatbot).  
  - **Experimental Group**: Interacts with the Socratic agent.  
- **Tasks**: Collaborative problem-solving in mathematics (e.g., calculus proofs) and humanities (e.g., ethical dilemmas).  

**2. Metrics:**  
- **Primary Outcomes**:  
  - **Explanation Quality (EQ)**: Scored on a 5-point rubric (precision, coherence).  
  - **Self-Correction Rate (SCR)**: Number of unprompted revisions per task.  
  - **Metacognitive Reflection Score (MRS)**: Frequency of phrases indicating self-assessment (e.g., "I need to reconsider...").  
- **Technical Metrics**:  
  - BLEU and ROUGE-L for response fluency.  
  - Diversity of generated questions (measured via n-gram entropy).  

**3. Statistical Analysis:**  
- Mixed-effects models to account for subject-specific variance.  
- Permutation tests to compare EQ, SCR, and MRS scores between groups.
