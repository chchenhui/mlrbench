Title: PeerGPT â€“ Adaptive AI-Powered Virtual Study Buddy

Motivation:  
Students often lack immediate peer support and practice opportunities, limiting collaborative learning benefits and self-explanation processes. Generative AI can serve as digital peers, but current systems fail to adapt to individual learner profiles and collaboration dynamics.

Main Idea:  
PeerGPT is an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback on educational dialogues and enriched with retrieval-augmented knowledge relevant to course materials. It monitors student inputs to identify misconceptions, dynamically adjusts task difficulty, and employs scaffolded prompts to foster reflection. The system simulates multiple peer personas for group activities, encouraging diverse viewpoints. Integrated into learning management systems, PeerGPT tracks progress metrics and personalizes conversation style to student preferences. We will prototype the platform and conduct a semester-long study comparing PeerGPT-supported cohorts against control groups, evaluating learning gains, engagement, and self-efficacy. This research can democratize high-quality peer learning at scale and inform best practices for human-AI collaborative education.
