**Title:** Generative AI as a Socratic Learning Partner for Collaborative Inquiry

**Motivation:** Collaborative learning fosters critical thinking, but effective peer interaction can be inconsistent or unavailable. While AI tutors provide answers, they often fail to stimulate the deeper inquiry and reflection that arises from genuine peer discussion and Socratic dialogue.

**Main Idea:** We propose developing an LLM-based agent designed to act as a Socratic learning partner, distinct from a typical AI tutor. Using carefully crafted prompting strategies and fine-tuning on curated educational dialogues emphasizing inquiry, the agent will simulate peer interactions. It will focus on posing probing questions, prompting students to articulate their reasoning, constructively challenging assumptions, and guiding exploration rather than providing direct solutions. We will evaluate the system through user studies, measuring its ability to elicit detailed student explanations, foster self-correction, and promote reflective thinking in problem-solving scenarios compared to conventional AI tutoring approaches. The expected outcome is a demonstrable prototype enhancing metacognitive skill development, offering a scalable tool for deeper learning experiences.
