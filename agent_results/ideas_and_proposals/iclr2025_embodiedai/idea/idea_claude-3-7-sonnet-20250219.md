# UrbanGPS: LLM-Enhanced Navigation in Dynamic City Environments

## Motivation
Current LLM agents struggle with navigation in dynamic urban environments due to limited spatial understanding and real-time adaptation capabilities. Traditional GPS systems rely on static maps and fail to incorporate contextual information like construction, events, or temporary obstacles. This research addresses the gap between static map-based navigation and the need for contextually-aware, adaptive routing in open city environments, which is essential for truly embodied intelligence in urban settings.

## Main Idea
UrbanGPS integrates LLMs with real-time environmental perception to create an adaptive navigation system for dynamic urban environments. The system combines three key components: (1) A spatial memory module that maintains a dynamic graph representation of the environment, updating as new information is perceived; (2) A contextual reasoning engine powered by LLMs that interprets visual inputs, environmental cues, and user preferences to make navigation decisions; and (3) A predictive planning algorithm that anticipates potential changes in the environment based on historical patterns and real-time observations. The system will be evaluated in a simulated urban environment with dynamic elements (construction zones, crowds, weather) and benchmarked against traditional GPS systems. Expected outcomes include significant improvements in navigation efficiency, reduction in rerouting frequency, and enhanced user satisfaction through more reliable and contextually appropriate guidance in complex urban environments.
