**Title:** "Embodied Intelligence for Open City Environments: Spatial Intelligence and Embodied Perception with LLM Agents"

**Motivation:** Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved impressive results in various natural language processing tasks, but their embodied intelligence in open city environments remains a significant challenge. Outdoor environments present unique challenges, such as dynamic scenes, hidden obstacles, and diverse user behaviors, making it difficult for LLM agents to develop a sense of space and time, reason, plan, and make decisions efficiently. The proposed research aims to advance the field of embodied intelligence for LLM agents in open city environments, focusing on spatial intelligence and embodied perception.

**Main Idea:** This research focuses on developing techniques for integrating spatial intelligence and embodied perception for LLM agents in outdoor environments. The proposed approach involves the following steps:

1. **Spatial Intelligence Framework**: Design a spatial intelligence framework for LLM agents, incorporating techniques such as spatial autocorrelation, topological graph-based reasoning, and graph neural networks to enable the development of a sense of space and time.
2. **Embodied Perception Module**: Develop an embodied perception module that integrates visual, auditory, and other sensor-derived information to enhance the agent's understanding of the environment.
3. **Multi-modal Fusion**: Investigate techniques for fusing spatial intelligence and embodied perception to create a comprehensive representation of the environment, enabling the agent to reason, plan, and make decisions effectively.
4. **Evaluation and Experimentation**: Evaluate the performance of the proposed framework using existing benchmarks and simulators, such as the OpenStreetMap Simulator, and design new testbeds and datasets for evaluating embodied LLM agents in outdoor environments.
5. **Real-world Deployment**: Deploy the developed framework in real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles, smart city infrastructure, and human-AI collaboration systems.

This research has the potential to significantly advance the field of embodied intelligence for LLM agents in open city environments, enabling the development of more efficient, safe, and effective AI systems for real-world applications.
