1. **Title**: **Neural-Symbolic Hybrid Mapping for LLM Agents in Open Urban Environments**  

2. **Motivation**: Spatial intelligence remains a core challenge for LLM agents in dynamic outdoor settings due to the complexity of real-world navigation, varying environmental conditions, and semantically rich urban layouts. Current approaches struggle with real-time adaptation to moving obstacles, multi-modal sensory fusion, and long-term spatial memory. Solving this could enable applications like autonomous delivery, urban search-and-rescue, and adaptive mobility services.  

3. **Main Idea**: Propose a **neural-symbolic hybrid mapping framework** that integrates LLM agents with dynamic topological maps enhanced by symbolic reasoning. The LLM would abstract spatial data (e.g., LiDAR, GPS, street signs) into hierarchical semantic representations (e.g., "main road → side street → pedestrian crossing"), while a neural SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) module updates low-level geometric maps. The LLM’s reasoning layer would use contextual summarization to prioritize paths based on goals (e.g., safety, speed) and external inputs (e.g., traffic alerts). The system would be trained using a reinforcement learning loop where the LLM adjusts symbolic rules based on navigation success, and the SLAM module refines embeddings via spatiotemporal consistency. Evaluation would use the CARLA simulator with adversarial weather agents and real-world San Francisco street data. Expected outcomes: improved cross-scenario generalization, reduced localization drift in dynamic environments, and interpretable path-planning decisions. Impact: Advances in embodied AI for large-scale outdoor autonomy and robust human-agent collaboration in urban ecosystems.
