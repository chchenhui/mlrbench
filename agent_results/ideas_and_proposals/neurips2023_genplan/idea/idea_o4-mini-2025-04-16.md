Title: Meta-Symbolic Heuristic Networks for Few-Shot Generalization in Sequential Decision Making

Motivation: Humans leverage abstract heuristics to solve new decision tasks with minimal experience, whereas deep-RL methods often demand vast samples and symbolic planners struggle with long horizons. Bridging these paradigms can yield sample-efficient, transferable agents.

Main Idea: We propose a neuro-symbolic framework where each SDM task is encoded as a symbolic graph of objects and relations. A meta-learned Graph Neural Network ingests these graphs to predict abstract subgoals or heuristic cost estimates. A lightweight symbolic planner then refines these suggestions into low-level actions. During training, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is applied across diverse SDM tasks (e.g., block stacking, maze navigation) so that the network rapidly adapts to unseen problems with few demonstrations. We will evaluate sample efficiency, generalization accuracy on held-out tasks, and planning horizon scalability. Expected outcomes include drastic reductions in training episodes and robust transfer to novel tasks. This approach advances generalization and transfer by uniting planning heuristics with deep learning.
