# LLM-Driven Carbon-Aware Workload Scheduling for Cloud Computing

## Motivation
Cloud computing datacenters account for approximately 1% of global electricity consumption, with their carbon footprint continuing to grow. Traditional workload scheduling approaches focus primarily on performance and cost optimization, with limited consideration of carbon emissions. As sustainability becomes a critical business and ethical imperative, there's an urgent need for intelligent systems that can dynamically schedule workloads to minimize carbon impact while maintaining performance requirements.

## Main Idea
This research proposes a novel LLM-based approach to carbon-aware workload scheduling in cloud environments. We'll develop a specialized LLM that integrates multiple data sources: real-time carbon intensity data from power grids, workload characteristics, datacenter efficiency metrics, and renewable energy availability. The system will use fine-tuned LLMs to predict workload patterns, energy consumption, and carbon emissions under different scheduling scenarios. Unlike rule-based or simple ML approaches, our LLM-based scheduler can understand complex interdependencies between workload types, time sensitivity, and geographic carbon intensity variations. The system will implement a continuous learning framework that improves scheduling decisions by analyzing the outcomes of previous scheduling choices. We expect this approach to reduce carbon emissions by 15-30% compared to traditional schedulers while maintaining SLAs, providing cloud providers with actionable pathways toward sustainability goals.
