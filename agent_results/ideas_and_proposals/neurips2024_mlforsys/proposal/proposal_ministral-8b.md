## Introduction

### Background
Cloud computing has revolutionized the way businesses operate by providing scalable and flexible computing resources. However, the growing demand for cloud services has led to a significant increase in energy consumption and carbon emissions. Traditional workload scheduling approaches primarily focus on performance and cost optimization, with limited consideration of carbon emissions. As sustainability becomes a critical business and ethical imperative, there is an urgent need for intelligent systems that can dynamically schedule workloads to minimize carbon impact while maintaining performance requirements.

### Research Objectives

1. **Integrate Diverse Data Sources**: Develop a system that integrates real-time carbon intensity data, workload characteristics, datacenter efficiency metrics, and renewable energy availability.
2. **Predict Workload Patterns and Energy Consumption**: Utilize fine-tuned LLMs to predict workload patterns, energy consumption, and carbon emissions under different scheduling scenarios.
3. **Optimize Scheduling Decisions**: Implement a continuous learning framework that improves scheduling decisions by analyzing the outcomes of previous scheduling choices.
4. **Achieve Significant Carbon Emission Reductions**: Demonstrate a reduction in carbon emissions by 15-30% compared to traditional schedulers while maintaining Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

### Significance
This research is significant because it addresses a critical challenge in cloud computing by developing a carbon-aware workload scheduler that leverages the power of LLMs. The proposed approach not only helps cloud providers meet their sustainability goals but also provides actionable pathways toward reducing the carbon footprint of cloud datacenters. By integrating diverse data sources and utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, this research aims to create a more sustainable and efficient cloud computing ecosystem.
