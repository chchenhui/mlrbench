**1. Title:** LLM-CWS: A Large Language Model Framework for Carbon-Aware Workload Scheduling in Cloud Environments

**2. Introduction**

*   **Background:** Cloud computing has become the backbone of modern digital infrastructure, supporting a vast range of applications and services. However, the proliferation of large-scale datacenters comes at a significant environmental cost. Globally, datacenters consume approximately 1-2% of total electricity production (Masanet et al., 2020), contributing substantially to carbon emissions. As climate change concerns intensify and sustainability becomes a critical factor for businesses and society, reducing the carbon footprint of cloud operations is paramount. Traditional workload scheduling in cloud environments primarily optimizes for performance (e.g., minimizing latency, maximizing throughput) and cost (resource utilization). While effective for service delivery, these approaches often neglect the environmental impact, specifically the carbon intensity of the electricity consumed. Carbon intensity varies significantly based on geographic location (grid mix) and time (due to fluctuating renewable energy generation). Exploiting these variations through intelligent scheduling presents a significant opportunity for carbon reduction.

*   **Existing Approaches & Limitations:** Recent research efforts, as highlighted in our literature review, have started addressing carbon-aware scheduling. Systems like PCAPS (Lechowicz et al., 2025) incorporate carbon and precedence constraints, CASPER (Souza et al., 2024) aligns web service workloads with low-carbon periods, CarbonClipper (Lechowicz et al., 2024) provides optimal algorithms for spatiotemporal management, and CarbonScaler (Hanafy et al., 2023) leverages workload elasticity. Other works focus on carbon-aware load balancing (Doe et al., 2023), ML-based footprint prediction (Brown et al., 2023), dynamic resource allocation (Black et al., 2024), integrating renewable forecasts (Blue et al., 2024), and serverless computing (Purple et al., 2025). AI-driven optimization frameworks are also emerging (Cyan et al., 2025). While these represent significant progress, they often rely on predefined heuristics, simplified models, or traditional machine learning techniques that may struggle with the intricate, dynamic, and high-dimensional nature of the problem. Specifically, capturing the complex interplay between diverse workload types (batch, interactive, latency-sensitive), their specific resource requirements, real-time grid carbon intensity fluctuations across multiple potential locations, datacenter operational states (e.g., PUE variations), and future predictions (workload arrivals, carbon intensity changes, renewable availability) remains a major challenge. Furthermore, existing methods might not easily adapt to incorporating qualitative policies or handling unforeseen system dynamics without significant re-engineering.

*   **Proposed Approach & Novelty:** This research proposes LLM-CWS (Large Language Model for Carbon-Aware Workload Scheduling), a novel framework leveraging the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for optimizing workload scheduling in cloud environments to minimize carbon emissions while respecting performance constraints (SLAs). We posit that LLMs, particularly when fine-tuned on domain-specific data, can excel at integrating and reasoning over diverse, multimodal data sources (structured time-series like carbon intensity, workload metrics, and potentially unstructured job descriptions or policy documents). LLMs possess inherent capabilities for pattern recognition, prediction, and complex decision-making, allowing them to potentially model the intricate dependencies between workload characteristics, energy consumption, carbon intensity forecasts, and scheduling outcomes more effectively than previous methods. Unlike rule-based systems or conventional ML models, LLMs can potentially understand nuances in workload requirements and make more holistic scheduling decisions (e.g., time-shifting batch jobs, geographically routing latency-tolerant tasks, co-locating synergistic jobs during low-carbon periods). The core novelty lies in formulating the carbon-aware scheduling problem as a task solvable by a specialized, fine-tuned LLM, capable of continuous learning from scheduling outcomes. This aligns directly with the MLsys workshop's interest in using ML (specifically LLMs) for systems challenges and applying ML for compute sustainability.

*   **Research Objectives:**
    1.  **Design and Develop LLM-CWS:** To create a novel framework using a fine-tuned LLM as the core scheduling intelligence for minimizing carbon emissions in cloud datacenters.
    2.  **Integrate Heterogeneous Data:** To effectively integrate real-time and predicted data streams, including grid carbon intensity, workload specifications (resource needs, deadlines, dependencies), datacenter power usage effectiveness (PUE), server power models, and renewable energy availability forecasts, into the LLM's decision-making context.
    3.  **Develop LLM-based Prediction Capabilities:** To leverage the LLM's capabilities (potentially augmented with specialized modules) for predicting future workload patterns, associated energy consumption under different hardware configurations, and resulting carbon emissions for various scheduling possibilities.
    4.  **Optimize Scheduling Decisions:** To utilize the LLM to generate or rank scheduling decisions (which jobs to run, when, and where) that minimize the overall carbon footprint while satisfying pre-defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) regarding job completion time or latency.
    5.  **Implement Continuous Learning:** To incorporate a feedback loop where the performance and carbon impact of past scheduling decisions are used to continuously refine and improve the LLM's scheduling strategy.
    6.  **Evaluate and Validate:** To rigorously evaluate LLM-CWS against state-of-the-art carbon-agnostic and carbon-aware scheduling baselines using realistic simulations driven by real-world traces and carbon data, quantifying both carbon savings and performance trade-offs.

*   **Significance:** This research holds significant potential environmental and economic benefits. By substantially reducing the carbon footprint of cloud operations (targeting 15-30% reduction as per the initial idea), it contributes directly to corporate sustainability goals and mitigates climate change impacts. For cloud providers, optimized energy usage translates to lower operational costs and potentially enhanced brand reputation. Scientifically, this work pushes the boundaries of ML for Systems by exploring the application of LLMs to a complex, dynamic optimization problem in system management, offering insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this domain compared to traditional approaches. It addresses the specific call of the MLsys workshop for novel ML applications in systems and sustainability.

**3. Methodology**

*   **Research Design:** This research will follow an iterative development and evaluation methodology. We will start by building a simulation environment, followed by data collection and preprocessing. We will then focus on developing the core LLM-CWS framework, including model selection, fine-tuning, and integration with prediction modules. Finally, we will conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the framework's effectiveness and compare it against baseline schedulers.

*   **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** We will gather data from multiple sources:
    1.  **Grid Carbon Intensity:** Real-time and forecasted marginal carbon intensity data for various geographic regions relevant to cloud datacenter locations. Public APIs like WattTime, Electricity Maps, or regional grid operator data will be used. Data will be sampled at appropriate intervals (e.g., 5-15 minutes).
    2.  **Workload Traces:** Publicly available cloud workload traces (e.g., Google Cluster Data, Azure VM Traces, Alibaba Cluster Trace V2018) will be used to represent realistic job arrival patterns, resource requests (CPU, memory, GPU), task durations, dependencies, and deadlines (where available or inferred). We will also generate synthetic workloads to specifically test sensitivity to job types (batch vs. interactive), priorities, and deadline stringency.
    3.  **Datacenter and Server Metrics:** Representative Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) values for different datacenter locations and potentially time variations. Standard server power consumption models (e.g., SPECpower benchmarks, models based on CPU/GPU utilization like the linear model $P = P_{idle} + (P_{max} - P_{idle}) \times utilization$) will be incorporated.
    4.  **Renewable Energy Data:** Forecasts for on-site or nearby renewable energy generation (e.g., solar, wind) if applicable to specific datacenter scenarios, potentially sourced from public weather APIs or specialized providers.
    5.  **Preprocessing:** Data will be cleaned, synchronized, and formatted into a consistent representation suitable for input to the LLM. This will involve time-series alignment, normalization, and potentially generating textual descriptions or structured prompts encapsulating the current system state, pending workloads, and future predictions.

*   **LLM-CWS Framework Architecture:** The proposed framework consists of the following key components:
    1.  **Input Module:** Collects and preprocesses the heterogeneous data streams described above. It formats the current system state, pending job queue, and relevant predictions (carbon intensity, renewables) into a context representation for the LLM. This could be a combination of structured data and natural language prompts (e.g., "System State: DC1 (Location A, Carbon: 50 gCO2/kWh, PUE: 1.2), DC2 (Location B, Carbon: 300 gCO2/kWh, PUE: 1.3). Pending Jobs: Job1 (Batch, CPU: 16, Mem: 64GB, DurationEst: 2h, Deadline: 10h), Job2 (Interactive, CPU: 4, Mem: 16GB, LatencyReq: 100ms). Predict future carbon intensity and suggest optimal schedule.").
    2.  **Core LLM Scheduler:** A pre-trained LLM (e.g., variants of Llama, GPT, Flan-T5) will be selected based on its reasoning capabilities and potential for efficient fine-tuning. This core model will be fine-tuned on a synthetically generated or historical dataset of scheduling problems and their corresponding optimal (or near-optimal) carbon-aware solutions. The LLM's task is to process the input context and generate a scheduling plan. This plan could specify:
        *   For each pending job: the assigned datacenter/server cluster, the start time (or priority order).
        *   Alternatively, the LLM could rank a set of candidate scheduling actions generated by a simpler heuristic.
    3.  **Prediction Sub-modules (Integrated or External):** While the LLM might handle short-term predictions inherently, we may integrate specialized models for:
        *   *Energy Consumption Prediction:* Given a job's resource profile and target hardware, predict its power draw over time. $P_{job}(t) = f_{power}(ResourceProfile_{job}, Hardware_{assigned})$.
        *   *Carbon Intensity Forecasting:* Predict future carbon intensity for relevant locations using time-series models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, or transformer-based models) trained on historical grid data. $C_{forecast}(l, t+\Delta t) = f_{carbon}(History(C(l, \tau)) | \tau \le t)$.
        *   *Job Duration Estimation:* Predict job completion times based on historical data and resource allocation. These predictions feed into the context provided to the Core LLM Scheduler.
    4.  **Scheduling Executor:** Translates the LLM's scheduling plan into actual commands for the underlying (simulated) cluster manager (e.g., Kubernetes, Slurm).
    5.  **Monitoring & Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitors the execution of jobs, actual energy consumed, actual carbon emissions incurred (based on real-time intensity during execution), and SLA adherence. This outcome data is collected and used to refine the LLM through:
        *   *Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):* Create new training examples mapping system state + job queue to the actual successful/optimal scheduling decision made or identified post-hoc.
        *   *Reinforcement Learning from Environmental Feedback (RLEF):* Define a reward function that balances carbon savings and SLA adherence. Use RL techniques (like PPO) to fine-tune the LLM to maximize this reward based on the outcomes observed in the simulation environment. The reward could be formulated as: $R = w_{carbon} \cdot (\Delta Carbon_{baseline} - \Delta Carbon_{LLM}) - w_{perf} \cdot (\sum_{j} Penalty(SLA_{j}))$, where $w$ are weights and $Penalty$ increases with SLA violation severity.

*   **Mathematical Formulation (Optimization Goal):** The implicit goal the LLM aims to optimize is minimizing the total carbon emissions ($E_{total}$) for a set of jobs $J$ over a time horizon $T$, subject to constraints:
    $$ \min E_{total} = \sum_{j \in J} \sum_{t=start_j}^{end_j} P_{job}(j, l_j, t) \cdot C(l_j, t) \cdot \Delta t $$
    Subject to:
    *   $end_j \le Deadline_j$ (for batch jobs)
    *   $Latency_j \le SLA_{latency}$ (for interactive jobs)
    *   $ResourceConstraints(j, l_j, t)$ (e.g., available CPU, memory)
    Where:
    *   $P_{job}(j, l_j, t)$ is the power consumed by job $j$ at location $l_j$ at time $t$.
    *   $C(l_j, t)$ is the carbon intensity of electricity at location $l_j$ at time $t$.
    *   $start_j, end_j$ are the start and end times of job $j$.
    *   $\Delta t$ is the time Dslot duration.
    The LLM does not explicitly solve this equation but learns a policy $\pi(Schedule | State)$ that produces schedules achieving low $E_{total}$ while satisfying constraints, leveraging its integrated prediction and reasoning capabilities.

*   **Experimental Design:**
    1.  **Simulation Environment:** We will use a discrete-event simulator, likely extending existing frameworks like CloudSimPy or developing a custom simulator tailored for carbon-aware scheduling across multiple geo-distributed datacenters. The simulator will model job arrivals, resource allocation, power consumption, network latency between DCs, and time-varying carbon intensity.
    2.  **Workloads:** A mix of workloads derived from real-world traces (Google, Azure, Alibaba) and synthetic generators will be used. Categories will include:
        *   *Batch Jobs:* Time-flexible but potentially long-running (e.g., data analytics, scientific computing).
        *   *Interactive/Latency-Sensitive Jobs:* Require low response times (e.g., web services, microservices).
        *   Varying resource requirements (CPU-bound, memory-bound, GPU-bound).
    3.  **Carbon Intensity Data & Scenarios:** We will use real carbon intensity data traces from different geographical grids (e.g., California ISO, UK National Grid, ERCOT) to simulate diverse scenarios with varying levels of renewable penetration and volatility.
    4.  **Baselines for Comparison:**
        *   *Carbon-Agnostic Schedulers:*
            *   FIFO (First-In, First-Out).
            *   Performance-Optimized (e.g., Shortest Job First, Tetris-like packing for utilization).
            *   Default Kubernetes Scheduler (affinity/anti-affinity based on location but not carbon).
        *   *Existing Carbon-Aware Approaches (Reproduced/Simplified):*
            *   Greedy Carbon-Aware: Always assign jobs to the location with the lowest *current* carbon intensity, respecting constraints.
            *   Time-Shifting Heuristic: Delay batch jobs until a predicted low-carbon window (similar concept to CASPER/CarbonScaler but potentially simpler logic).
            *   Spatial-Shifting Heuristic: Route jobs to the lowest carbon location available at submission time (similar to basic Carbon-Aware Load Balancing). We may implement simplified versions of algorithms like those in PCAPS or CarbonClipper where feasible as stronger baselines.
    5.  **Evaluation Metrics:**
        *   **Primary:**
            *   Total Carbon Emissions Saved (% reduction compared to baselines).
            *   Average Carbon Intensity per Job/Task (gCO2eq/task or /kWh).
        *   **Secondary (Performance & Cost):**
            *   Average Job Completion Time (JCT) / Makespan (for batch).
            *   Average Job Response Time / Tail Latency (for interactive).
            *   SLA Violation Rate (%).
            *   Datacenter Resource Utilization (CPU, Memory).
            *   Scheduling Overhead (computational time taken by the scheduler).
            *   Energy Cost (if pricing data is available).

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

    1.  **A Functional LLM-CWS Prototype:** A demonstrable software framework implementing the proposed LLM-based carbon-aware scheduler within the simulation environment.
    2.  **Quantitative Performance Evaluation:** Comprehensive results demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-CWS. We expect to show significant carbon emission reductions (aiming for the 15-30% range suggested, potentially higher depending on workload flexibility and carbon intensity variance) compared to carbon-agnostic baselines, while maintaining performance close to SLA requirements. We also anticipate outperforming simpler carbon-aware heuristic baselines due to the LLM's ability to handle complex trade-offs.
    3.  **Comparative Analysis:** Insights into the specific scenarios where LLM-CWS excels (e.g., workloads with mixed constraints, highly volatile carbon intensity) and its limitations (e.g., potential overhead, sensitivity to prediction accuracy).

    1.  **Environmental:** Provide a concrete, technologically advanced pathway for cloud providers and large-scale computing users to significantly reduce their operational carbon footprint, contributing to global climate change mitigation efforts.
    2.  **Economic:** Potential for reduced energy costs for cloud providers through more efficient, carbon-aware resource utilization. Offer competitive advantages to providers who can offer verifiably "greener" computing services.
    3.  **Scientific:** Advance the state-of-the-art in both sustainable computing and Machine Learning for Systems. It will showcase a novel application of LLMs beyond traditional NLP tasks, demonstrating their potential for complex optimization and control in system management. This directly addresses the themes of the MLsys workshop.
    4.  **Practical:** If successful and efficient, the principles and developed models could inform the design of next-generation schedulers deployed in real-world datacenters. Findings and potentially code could be open-sourced to benefit the wider research and practitioner community.
