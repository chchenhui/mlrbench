**Title:** Generative Structural Foundation Models for Therapeutic Nucleic Acid Design  

**Motivation:** Current generative models for nucleic acids (NAs) primarily focus on sequence generation, neglecting 3D structural and interaction dynamics critical for therapeutic efficacy. Integrating structural insights into generative AI could bridge this gap, enabling precise design of functional NAs for diseases like cancer or genetic disorders.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a multimodal foundation model that co-generates NA sequences, their tertiary structures, and interaction profiles. The model will leverage transformer-based architectures trained on paired sequence-structure datasets (e.g., RNA-PDB, ligand interaction databases) and incorporate diffusion models for probabilistic structure refinement. To ensure biological relevance, the framework will condition generation on functional constraints (e.g., target binding affinity, stability). Validation will involve molecular dynamics simulations for structural stability and in vitro testing of generated NAs for target binding and therapeutic activity. Expected outcomes include a unified tool for designing NAs with higher success rates in drug discovery, reducing trial-and-error experimentation. Potential impact spans accelerated development of RNA vaccines, gene therapies, and precision medicine pipelines.
