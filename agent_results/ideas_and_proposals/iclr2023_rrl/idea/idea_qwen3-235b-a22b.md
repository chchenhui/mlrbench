1. **Title**: **Retroactive Policy Correction in Reincarnating RL via Suboptimal Data Distillation**  
2. **Motivation**: Reincarnating RL struggles with suboptimal prior computation (e.g., outdated policies, biased datasets), which can propagate errors and limit performance. Existing methods often naively trust prior work, hindering robustness. Addressing this could democratize RL by enabling reliable iterative improvements even with imperfect artifacts, reducing redundant computation.  
3. **Main Idea**: We propose a framework that distills *corrected* policies from suboptimal prior data by jointly learning action-values and uncertainty estimates. First, a prior dataset (e.g., offline trajectories, legacy policies) is used to train an ensemble of Q-networks, which identify high-uncertainty regions in the data. Next, a new policy is trained via offline RL, but with a distillation loss that downweights actions from uncertain regions and prioritizes updates where the prior is reliable. This retroactive correction allows the agent to iteratively refine flawed prior knowledge while mitigating error compounding. We evaluate on Atari and continuous control tasks, injecting synthetic suboptimality into prior data (e.g., partial observability, stale policies). Results show significant performance gains over standard fine-tuning and offline RL baselines, particularly when priors are severely suboptimal. This work bridges the gap between reincarnating RL theory and real-world deployment, where prior computation is rarely perfect, enabling safer and more efficient iterative RL development.
