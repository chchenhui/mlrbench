### Title: Efficient Reincarnation of Reinforcement Learning Agents with Incremental Policy Transfer

### Motivation
Reusing prior computation in reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly reduce the computational burden and democratize access to large-scale RL problems. This is particularly important for real-world applications where prior computational work is available, and iterative improvements are crucial. By focusing on incremental policy transfer, we aim to address the inefficiencies of tabula rasa RL and enable continuous improvements in agent performance.

### Main Idea
This research idea proposes a novel method for reusing prior computational work in RL by incrementally transferring policies between agents. The approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained policies on new tasks or environments, allowing for efficient updates and adaptations without the need for extensive retraining from scratch. The methodology involves:

1. **Policy Fine-Tuning**: Utilizing pre-trained policies as a starting point and fine-tuning them on new tasks or environments using a small amount of new data.
2. **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling**: Implementing adaptive learning rate schedules to balance the trade-off between exploiting pre-trained knowledge and exploring new task-specific features.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Developing evaluation protocols to measure the effectiveness of incremental policy transfer, including task-specific performance metrics and computational efficiency.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved computational efficiency in RL training.
- Enhanced adaptability of RL agents to new tasks and environments.
- Standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols for incremental policy transfer.

Potential impact:
- Enabling resource-limited researchers to tackle large-scale RL problems.
- Facilitating continuous improvements in real-world RL applications.
- Promoting a new paradigm in RL research that emphasizes the reuse of prior computational work.
