1. **Title**: Integrating Human Feedback into a Reinforcement Learning-Based Framework for Adaptive User Interfaces (arXiv:2504.20782)
   - **Authors**: Daniel Gaspar-Figueiredo, Marta Fernández-Diego, Silvia Abrahão, Emilio Insfran
   - **Summary**: This paper presents an enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) framework for adaptive user interfaces (AUIs) that incorporates personalized human feedback directly into the learning process. Unlike prior approaches relying on a single pre-trained RL model, this method trains a unique RL agent for each user, allowing individuals to actively shape their personal agent's policy. An empirical study involving 33 participants demonstrated that integrating human feedback into RL-driven adaptations significantly enhances user experience (UX).

2. **Title**: Reinforcement Learning-Based Framework for the Intelligent Adaptation of User Interfaces (arXiv:2405.09255)
   - **Authors**: Daniel Gaspar-Figueiredo, Marta Fernández-Diego, Ruben Nuredini, Silvia Abrahão, Emilio Insfrán
   - **Summary**: This work introduces a reference framework for intelligent UI adaptation using RL to improve UX. The system learns from past adaptations to enhance decision-making capabilities. The authors propose using predictive Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) models to evaluate the outcomes of each adaptation action performed by the RL agent. An implementation of the framework, extending OpenAI Gym, serves as a toolkit for developing and comparing RL algorithms in UI adaptation contexts. Evaluation results indicate successful training of RL agents capable of adapting UIs to maximize user engagement.

3. **Title**: Learning from Interaction: User Interface Adaptation using Reinforcement Learning (arXiv:2312.07216)
   - **Authors**: Daniel Gaspar-Figueiredo
   - **Summary**: This PhD thesis proposes an RL-based UI adaptation framework that utilizes physiological data to learn from user interactions and make informed adaptations to improve UX. The research aims to answer questions regarding the effectiveness of RL in guiding UI adaptation and the role of physiological data in supporting UI adaptation. The evaluation plan involves conducting user studies to assess the framework's impact on UX, with expected contributions including the development of a novel framework for intelligent adaptive UIs and insights into the integration of physiological data as objective measures of UX.

4. **Title**: A Comparative Study on Reward Models for UI Adaptation with Reinforcement Learning (arXiv:2308.13937)
   - **Authors**: Daniel Gaspar-Figueiredo, Silvia Abrahão, Marta Fernández-Diego, Emilio Insfran
   - **Summary**: This paper presents a study investigating the effectiveness of two approaches for generating reward models in the context of UI adaptation using RL: (1) employing a reward model derived exclusively from predictive HCI models (HCI), and (2) employing predictive HCI models augmented by human feedback (HCI&HF). A controlled experiment using an AB/BA crossover design with two treatments aims to determine how these approaches affect UX when interacting with adaptive user interfaces. The study contributes to understanding how reward modeling can facilitate UI adaptation using RL.

   - **Authors**: Various
   - **Summary**: This article discusses the concept of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where human feedback is collected by prompting humans to rank instances of the agent's behavior. These rankings are used to score outputs, for example, using the Elo rating system. RLHF has been applied to various domains of natural language processing, such as conversational agents, text summarization, and natural language understanding.

## Key Challenges

1. **Real-Time Responsiveness**: Ensuring that adaptive UI systems can respond to user interactions in real-time remains a significant challenge. Delays in adaptation can lead to user frustration and decreased engagement.

2. **Personalization Accuracy**: Developing models that accurately capture and predict individual user preferences is complex. Misinterpretation of user behavior can result in inappropriate adaptations, negatively impacting the user experience.

3. **Integration of Implicit and Explicit Feedback**: Effectively combining implicit feedback (e.g., interaction patterns) with explicit feedback (e.g., user ratings) to inform UI adaptations requires sophisticated algorithms capable of balancing and interpreting diverse data sources.

4. **Scalability and Generalization**: Creating adaptive UI systems that scale across diverse applications and user groups while maintaining performance and personalization is challenging. Models must generalize well to accommodate varying contexts and user needs.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Establishing standardized and meaningful metrics to evaluate the success of adaptive UI systems is difficult. Traditional metrics may not fully capture the nuances of user satisfaction and engagement in dynamic, personalized interfaces.
