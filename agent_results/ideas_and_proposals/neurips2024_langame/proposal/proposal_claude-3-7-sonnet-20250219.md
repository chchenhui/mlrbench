# Planning via Persuasion: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Adversarial Language Games

## 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, answering questions, and assisting with a wide range of language tasks (Brown et al., 2020). Despite these advancements, LLMs continue to exhibit significant limitations in complex multi-step planning and reasoning (Valmeekam et al., 2023). These models often struggle with maintaining logical consistency across extended reasoning chains, considering multiple potential outcomes, and adapting plans in response to changing conditions or constraints.

A key factor contributing to these limitations is the traditional training paradigm of LLMs, which primarily relies on supervised learning from static corpora. While this approach effectively teaches models to mimic patterns in human-written text, it fails to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of genuine language acquisition and reasoning development. As Wittgenstein posited in his concept of "language games," language is fundamentally an adaptive system where meaning emerges through use and social interaction (Wittgenstein, 1953). Current training methods neglect this crucial interactive dimension, resulting in models that can simulate planning without truly developing robust planning capabilities.

Recent research in cognitive science and language emergence simulations has underscored the importance of dynamic, context-driven interactions in language acquisition (Kirby et al., 2014; Steels, 2015). These findings suggest that genuine reasoning and planning abilities might similarly develop through interactive processes rather than passive learning. Work in game theory further demonstrates that interactive self-play loops often outperform traditional imitation-based learning models (Silver et al., 2017), yet this insight has rarely been applied to LLM training specifically for planning and reasoning skills.

This research proposal addresses these limitations by introducing a novel framework: "Planning via Persuasion." Our approach leverages the concept of Language Gamification through an adversarial language game designed to enhance LLMs' planning and reasoning capabilities. In this setup, we use Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to train LLM agents in a structured "Persuasion Game" where one agent (the Planner) must devise multi-step plans and persuade another agent (the Skeptic) of their feasibility and correctness through interactive dialogue.

The objectives of this research are:

1. To develop a formal framework for the Persuasion Game that effectively targets and enhances planning and reasoning abilities in LLMs
2. To implement an efficient DRL training procedure that enables LLMs to learn from adversarial interactions
3. To evaluate the impact of this training paradigm on planning performance across multiple domains and complexity levels
4. To analyze the emergent reasoning strategies that develop through these adversarial interactions

The significance of this research extends beyond merely improving LLM performance. By creating a training paradigm that better reflects the interactive nature of human language acquisition, we advance the theoretical understanding of how complex cognitive abilities can emerge in artificial systems. Furthermore, LLMs with enhanced planning capabilities could dramatically improve applications requiring structured reasoning, including complex decision-making, educational support, programming assistance, and navigating novel problem domains.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 The Persuasion Game Framework

The Persuasion Game is an adversarial language game involving two LLM agents with distinct roles:

1. **The Planner**: This agent receives a planning task and must develop a multi-step plan to achieve specified objectives. The Planner must then explain and defend this plan through dialogue.

2. **The Skeptic**: This agent critically evaluates the Planner's proposed solution, identifying potential flaws, inefficiencies, or inconsistencies. The Skeptic challenges the Planner through questions, counterarguments, or requests for clarification.

The game structure follows a turn-based protocol:

1. Both agents receive a planning problem statement with objectives, constraints, and available actions
2. The Planner proposes an initial plan
3. The Skeptic evaluates the plan and responds with critiques, questions, or challenges
4. The Planner addresses the Skeptic's concerns, possibly revising the plan
5. Steps 3-4 repeat for a maximum of $T$ turns or until the Skeptic is convinced
6. The final plan is evaluated against ground-truth criteria

### 2.2 Data Preparation

We will construct a diverse dataset of planning problems across multiple domains:

1. **Logical Planning**: Problems requiring structured application of rules (e.g., puzzles, scheduling problems)
2. **Strategic Planning**: Tasks requiring long-term strategy development (e.g., game strategies, resource allocation)
3. **Process Planning**: Procedural tasks with explicit ordering requirements (e.g., cooking recipes, assembly instructions)
4. **Contingency Planning**: Problems requiring consideration of multiple scenarios and uncertainties

For each domain, we will develop:
- 1,000 training problems with varying complexity levels
- 200 validation problems
- 200 test problems

For each problem, we will create:
- A problem statement with clear objectives
- A set of constraints and available actions
- Multiple valid solution paths (where possible)
- Evaluation criteria for solution quality

### 2.3 Reinforcement Learning Framework

We adopt a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) as our base algorithm. Both Planner and Skeptic are instantiated as LLMs (initially using the same base model) that are further trained through reinforcement learning.

**State Space**: The state $s_t$ at turn $t$ consists of:
- The original problem description $P$
- The dialogue history up to turn $t$: $H_t = \{u_1, u_2, ..., u_t\}$, where $u_i$ represents the utterance at turn $i$
- For the Planner only: the current version of the plan $p_t$

**Action Space**: The action space consists of all possible text utterances. In practice, we constrain this to:
- For the Planner: Initial plan proposals, responses to critiques, and plan revisions
- For the Skeptic: Questions, critiques, and endorsements of the plan

**Reward Functions**:

For the Planner ($R_P$):
$$R_P = \alpha R_{conv} + \beta R_{plan} + \gamma R_{adapt} - \delta R_{length}$$

Where:
- $R_{conv}$ is a reward for successfully convincing the Skeptic, measured as +1 if the Skeptic explicitly endorses the plan, +0.5 if the Skeptic has no further critiques, and 0 otherwise
- $R_{plan}$ is a reward based on the objective quality of the final plan as measured against ground-truth evaluation criteria
- $R_{adapt}$ rewards the Planner for making appropriate adaptations to the plan in response to valid critiques
- $R_{length}$ is a small penalty proportional to dialogue length to encourage efficiency

For the Skeptic ($R_S$):
$$R_S = \epsilon R_{valid} + \zeta R_{diverse} - \eta R_{false} - \theta R_{trivial}$$

Where:
- $R_{valid}$ rewards the Skeptic for identifying genuine flaws in the plan that are confirmed by ground-truth evaluation
- $R_{diverse}$ encourages diverse types of critiques (e.g., feasibility, efficiency, contingency planning)
- $R_{false}$ penalizes the Skeptic for raising invalid critiques that do not correspond to actual flaws
- $R_{trivial}$ penalizes overly simplistic or repetitive critiques

### 2.4 Training Procedure

Our training procedure builds on recent advances in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022), adapted to a multi-agent setting:

1. **Initialization**: Both Planner and Skeptic are initialized from the same pretrained LLM (we will experiment with different model sizes).

2. **Supervised Fine-tuning**: We perform initial supervised fine-tuning using a small dataset of human-generated dialogues for both Planner and Skeptic roles to establish appropriate dialogue patterns.

3. **Reward Model Training**: We train separate reward models to approximate the reward functions described above, using a combination of human annotations and rule-based evaluations.

4. **MARL Training Loop**:
   - Sample a planning problem from the training set
   - Conduct a Persuasion Game dialogue between current Planner and Skeptic models
   - Evaluate the dialogue using the reward models to calculate $R_P$ and $R_S$
   - Update both models using PPO with their respective rewards
   - Periodically evaluate performance on the validation set

5. **Progressive Curriculum**: We implement a curriculum learning approach, starting with simple planning problems and progressively increasing complexity as performance improves.

The PPO update for each agent follows the standard optimization objective:

$$L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \hat{E}_t[\min(r_t(\theta)\hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)\hat{A}_t)]$$

Where $r_t(\theta)$ is the probability ratio between the new and old policies, $\hat{A}_t$ is the estimated advantage function, and $\epsilon$ is the clipping parameter.

### 2.5 Experimental Design

We will conduct a comprehensive series of experiments to evaluate our approach:

**Experiment 1: Comparative Model Evaluation**
- Compare planning performance between:
  - Base LLM without specialized training
  - LLM fine-tuned with supervised planning examples
  - LLM trained with our Persuasion Game framework
- Evaluate across all four planning domains using test problems

**Experiment 2: Ablation Studies**
- Isolate the contribution of different components:
  - Fixed vs. learning Skeptic
  - Different reward function components
  - Dialogue length constraints
  - Curriculum learning strategy

**Experiment 3: Cross-Domain Transfer**
- Train on three domains and test on the fourth to evaluate transfer learning capabilities
- Measure performance degradation compared to in-domain training

**Experiment 4: Human Evaluation**
- Conduct human evaluations of plans generated by different approaches
- Train a human-in-the-loop variant where human evaluators occasionally replace the Skeptic

**Experiment 5: Scaling Analysis**
- Analyze how performance changes with:
  - LLM model size
  - Training dataset size
  - Maximum dialogue turns

### 2.6 Evaluation Metrics

We will employ multiple evaluation metrics to comprehensively assess performance:

1. **Plan Success Rate**: Percentage of plans that successfully achieve the stated objectives when executed (either in simulation or by evaluation against ground-truth criteria)

2. **Plan Optimality**: Measure of how close the plan is to optimal, using domain-specific metrics (e.g., steps required, resources used)

3. **Plan Robustness**: Performance when certain assumptions are violated or unexpected events occur

4. **Persuasion Success Rate**: Percentage of dialogues where the Skeptic is ultimately convinced

5. **Reasoning Quality**: Human evaluation of the cogency and coherence of the Planner's reasoning

6. **Adaptation Quality**: Measure of how effectively the Planner improves plans in response to critique

7. **Dialogue Efficiency**: Number of turns required to reach a convincing plan

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### 3.1 Primary Expected Outcomes

The successful implementation of this research is expected to yield several significant outcomes:

1. **Enhanced Planning Capabilities in LLMs**: We anticipate a substantial improvement in LLMs' abilities to formulate coherent, multi-step plans across diverse domains. Specifically, we expect our approach to yield improvements in plan success rates of at least a 20% increase compared to baseline models without interactive training.

2. **Novel Training Methodology**: This research will establish a validated framework for using adversarial language games to train LLMs in specific cognitive skills, with potential applications beyond planning to other reasoning domains.

3. **Improved Logical Coherence**: The adversarial nature of the Persuasion Game should significantly enhance LLMs' abilities to maintain logical consistency across extended reasoning chains, with expected reductions in logical contradictions by at least 30%.

4. **Adaptive Reasoning Strategies**: We expect to observe the emergence of sophisticated adaptive reasoning patterns in trained models, including the ability to backtrack from flawed approaches, integrate new constraints mid-planning, and defend decisions with principled justifications.

5. **Domain-General Planning Skills**: The cross-domain experiments will likely demonstrate improved transfer learning capabilities, with models showing enhanced ability to tackle novel planning problems outside their training distribution.

### 3.2 Theoretical and Practical Impact

This research has the potential for broad impact across several dimensions:

**Theoretical Contributions**:

### 3.3 Limitations and Future Directions

While we anticipate significant advances from this work, several limitations and opportunities for future research remain:

1. **Computational Requirements**: The proposed approach requires substantial computational resources, which may limit accessibility. Future work could focus on developing more efficient training methods.

2. **Ground Truth Dependence**: Our evaluation relies partly on access to ground-truth plan evaluations, which may not be available in all real-world domains. Developing fully unsupervised evaluation methods is an important direction.

3. **Cross-Modal Planning**: This research focuses exclusively on text-based planning, but many real-world planning problems involve multi-modal reasoning. Extending the framework to incorporate visual or physical information would be valuable.

4. **Human Preference Alignment**: While our approach enhances planning abilities, it does not specifically target alignment with human preferences and values. Combining our method with preference alignment techniques represents an important future direction.

5. **Real-World Deployment**: Moving from controlled experimental settings to real-world applications will require addressing additional challenges related to safety, robustness, and user interaction.

In conclusion, this research proposal outlines a novel approach to enhancing planning and reasoning capabilities in LLMs through adversarial language games. By leveraging the dynamic, interactive nature of language as conceptualized by Wittgenstein and supported by cognitive science research, we aim to develop LLMs that can plan more effectively, reason more coherently, and adapt their thinking in response to critique. The expected outcomes have significant implications for both theoretical understanding of AI capabilities and practical applications across numerous domains.
