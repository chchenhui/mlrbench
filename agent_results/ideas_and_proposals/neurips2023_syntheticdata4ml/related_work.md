**Key Challenges:**

1. **Balancing Data Utility and Privacy**: Ensuring that synthetic data maintains high utility while adhering to differential privacy constraints is a significant challenge. The addition of noise to satisfy privacy requirements often degrades data quality, impacting the performance of downstream machine learning models.

2. **Incorporating Fairness Constraints**: Integrating fairness constraints into the data generation process is complex, as it requires addressing biases present in the original data without introducing new biases. Achieving fairness while maintaining data utility and privacy adds to the complexity of the task.

3. **Model Training Stability**: Training models under differential privacy constraints can lead to instability, such as mode collapse in GANs or incoherent outputs in language models. Ensuring stable and reliable training processes is crucial for generating high-quality synthetic data.

4. **Scalability and Efficiency**: Developing methods that are scalable and efficient for large datasets is challenging. Differential privacy mechanisms often introduce computational overhead, making it difficult to apply these methods to large-scale data synthesis tasks.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Establishing robust evaluation metrics that effectively measure the trade-offs between data utility, privacy, and fairness is essential. Current metrics may not fully capture the nuances of these trade-offs, making it challenging to assess the performance of synthetic data generation methods comprehensively.
