# Differentially Private and Fair Tabular Data Synthesis via Constrained Large Language Models

## 1. Introduction

### Background
Generating synthetic data is a promising solution to address the challenges of data scarcity, privacy, and bias in machine learning. High-quality synthetic data can enable the training and evaluation of machine learning algorithms even when high-quality real datasets are scarce or unavailable. However, generating synthetic data that maintains both high utility and strong privacy and fairness guarantees is a complex task. Existing methods often focus on either high-fidelity data generation or privacy and fairness constraints but fail to address these issues comprehensively.

### Research Objectives
The primary objective of this research is to develop a method for generating differentially private and fair synthetic tabular data using large language models (LLMs). This involves fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs to generate synthetic data that adheres to differential privacy constraints and incorporates fairness constraints. The research aims to balance data utility, privacy, and fairness, ensuring that the synthetic data is both realistic and ethically sound.

### Significance
The significance of this research lies in its potential to advance the field of synthetic data generation by addressing the key challenges of privacy and fairness. By developing a method that explicitly controls for these constraints, we can enable more trustworthy machine learning model development in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance. Furthermore, this research contributes to the broader goal of promoting ethical and responsible machine learning by ensuring that synthetic data does not perpetuate societal biases.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Research Design

#### 2.1.1 Data Collection
We will use publicly available tabular datasets that cover a range of domains, including healthcare, finance, and education. These datasets will serve as the ground truth data for evaluating the performance of our synthetic data generation method. We will also collect metadata on sensitive attributes to incorporate fairness constraints into the data generation process.

#### 2.1.2 Model Architecture
We will use a pre-trained LLM as the foundation for our synthetic data generation model. The specific architecture will depend on the dataset characteristics and the desired data modalities. For tabular data, we may use models such as T5 or BART, which have shown promise in tabular data generation tasks.

#### 2.1.3 Differential Privacy Mechanisms
To ensure differential privacy, we will incorporate the following mechanisms into our model:

- **DP-SGD**: We will use the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm with differential privacy noise added to the gradients during training. This will ensure that the model's training process is robust to privacy attacks.
- **Noise Injection**: During the data generation process, we will inject noise into the generated data to satisfy differential privacy constraints. The amount of noise will be determined based on the desired privacy level.

#### 2.1.4 Fairness Constraints
To incorporate fairness constraints into the data generation process, we will use the following approaches:

- **Demographic Parity**: We will ensure that the synthetic data does not exhibit demographic parity violations by adjusting the generation process to balance the representation of sensitive attributes.
- **Equalized Odds**: We will ensure that the synthetic data does not exhibit equalized odds violations by adjusting the generation process to balance the odds of sensitive attributes across different classes.

### 2.2 Algorithmic Steps

#### 2.2.1 Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove any missing or inconsistent data from the ground truth dataset.
2. **Sensitive Attribute Identification**: Identify sensitive attributes in the dataset that will be used to incorporate fairness constraints.

#### 2.2.2 Model Fine-Tuning
1. **Initial Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the pre-trained LLM on the ground truth dataset using non-private SGD.
2. **Differential Privacy Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the LLM with DP-SGD on the ground truth dataset, incorporating differential privacy noise into the gradients.
3. **Fairness Constraint Incorporation**: Incorporate fairness constraints into the LLM's training objective or decoding process. This may involve adjusting the loss function to penalize violations of demographic parity and equalized odds.

#### 2.2.3 Data Generation
1. **Generative Process**: Use the fine-tuned LLM to generate synthetic tabular data.
2. **Noise Injection**: Inject noise into the generated data to satisfy differential privacy constraints.
3. **Fairness Constraint Enforcement**: Enforce fairness constraints during the generation process to ensure that the synthetic data does not perpetuate biases present in the original dataset.

### 2.3 Evaluation Metrics

#### 2.3.1 Data Utility
- **Fidelity**: Measure the similarity between the generated synthetic data and the ground truth data using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or cosine similarity.
- **Generalization**: Evaluate the performance of machine learning models trained on the synthetic data on a held-out test set.

#### 2.3.2 Privacy
- **Differential Privacy Guarantees**: Quantify the privacy guarantees provided by the synthetic data using metrics such as the privacy loss parameter (Îµ).
- **Privacy Attacks**: Perform privacy attacks on the synthetic data to assess its resistance to privacy breaches.

#### 2.3.3 Fairness
- **Demographic Parity**: Measure the demographic parity of the synthetic data using metrics such as the demographic parity difference (DPD).
- **Equalized Odds**: Measure the equalized odds of the synthetic data using metrics such as the equalized odds difference (EOD).

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### 3.1 Expected Outcomes
- **High-Quality Synthetic Data**: Generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data that maintains strong privacy and fairness guarantees.
- **Quantifiable Privacy Guarantees**: Provide quantifiable differential privacy guarantees for the generated synthetic data.
- **Improved Fairness Metrics**: Achieve improved fairness metrics compared to baseline generation methods, ensuring that the synthetic data does not perpetuate societal biases.

### 3.2 Impact
This research has the potential to significantly impact the field of synthetic data generation by addressing the key challenges of privacy and fairness. By developing a method that explicitly controls for these constraints, we can enable more trustworthy machine learning model development in sensitive domains. Furthermore, this research contributes to the broader goal of promoting ethical and responsible machine learning by ensuring that synthetic data does not perpetuate societal biases.
