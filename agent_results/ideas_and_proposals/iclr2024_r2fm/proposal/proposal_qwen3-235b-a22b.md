# Intervention-Based Causal Pruning for Spurious Feature Removal in Foundation Models

## Introduction

### Background
Foundation models (FMs) such as large language models and vision-language systems have demonstrated remarkable performance across domains like healthcare, finance, and education. However, their reliance on spurious correlations—superficial patterns that co-occur with labels in training data but lack causal relationships—poses critical risks. For example, text classifiers may associate sentiment scores with demographic tokens (KIR:earl_kir_s_2023), while vision models can latch on to contextually irrelevant textures (SEraser:ma2024spurious). These spurious features degrade out-of-distribution generalization, amplify biases, and enable adversarial attacks. The lack of causal reasoning exacerbates "hallucinations" in language tasks and poor calibration in high-stakes decisions. Addressing this requires frameworks that not only detect but remove these brittle, harmful representations while preserving functionality.

### Research Objectives
This proposal introduces a two-stage intervention-based causal pruning pipeline to address spurious dependencies in FMs. Specifically:
1. **Causal Attribution**: Identify spurious features by quantifying their causal influence on task-specific outputs through counterfactual interventions.
2. **Intervention-Guided Pruning & Reweighting**: Eliminate or down-weigh identified features via targeted sparsity and contrastive learning, enforcing robustness to domain shifts and input perturbations.

### Significance
This research aligns with the R²-FM workshop's dual goals of model reliability and responsibility. By providing generalizable strategies to operate with crumbs of causality, our approach:
1. Reduces downstream risks like biased predictions (e.g., clinical triage, loan approvals).
2. Improves transparency through interpretable feature rankings.
3. Advances theoretical understanding of causal mechanisms in large-scale systems.
4. Addresses real-world application concerns by preserving cross-domain performance on critical tasks like drug discovery.

Compared to prior works (Mishra et al., CCR, SEraser), our methodology uniquely applies mechanistic interpretability to isolae intervention effects at scale while ensuring train-time model adaptation preserves utility.

## Methodology

### Stage 1: Causal Attribution via Targeted Interventions

#### Feature Selection and Intervention Hypothesis
We operationalize spurious features as activations that exhibit non-invariant associations with outputs. Given a pretrained model $f(\cdot)$ with $L$ layers and $d$-dimensional hidden states $h_{l,i} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ at layer $l$ and token position $i$:
1. **Choose Target Units**: Identify topological clusters (e.g., attention heads, MLP channels) using sensitivity measures $\| \nabla_{h_{l,i}} f(x) \|$ across diverse inputs $x \in \mathcal{D}$.
2. **Define Intervention Hypotheses**: Repair spurious correlations for domain shifts (e.g., gender in sentiment), factual errors in QA (e.g., named entity hallucination), or geometric distortions in vision (e.g., background artifacts).

#### Intervention Design
We implement the "do operator" $do(h_{l,i} = \tilde{h})$ through three transformations:
1. **Masking**: Zero-out specific features $h_{l,i} \leftarrow 0$.
2. **Swapping**: Exchange hidden representations between contrasting counterfactual inputs $h_{l,i}^{(x)} \leftrightarrow h_{l,i}^{(x')}$.
3. **Scaling**: Multiply by scalar $\alpha$ to amplify/shrink feature activation.

**Algorithmic Steps**:
1. Sample diverse counterfactual input pairs $(x, x')$ from domain shifts (e.g., male/female pronouns in NLP).
2. For each target unit $h_{l,i}$:
   - Forward pass baseline $p = f(x)$, $p' = f(x')$.
   - Apply $do(h_{l,i} = 0)$ on $x$ and $do(h_{l,i} = \tilde{h})$ swapping with $x'$, yield $p_{do}$, $p'_{do}$.
3. Repeat across stochastic augmentations (e.g., dropout, input permutations).

#### Causal Effect Quantification
We compute two metrics per feature:
1. **Spurious Sensitivity Score (SSS)**:
$$ S_{l,i} = \mathbb{E}_{x,x'} \left[ D_{KL}\left(p \parallel p_{do(h_{l,i}=0)}) + D_{KL}(p' \parallel p'_{do(h_{l,i}\leftrightarrow x')}\right) \right] $$
Measures vulnerability to factual errors from interventions.

2. **Invariance Disruption Score (IDS)**:
$$ I_{l,i} = \mathbb{E}_{x,d} \left[ ||f(x; \theta) - f(do(h_{l,i}=mask(x_d)); \theta)||_2 \right] $$
Assesses feature stability across domains $d$.

Aggregate scores $R_{l,i} = \beta S_{l,i} + (1-\beta)I_{l,i}$ determine pruning priority ($\beta=0.5$ by default). High $R_{l,i}$ indicates strong spuriousness.

### Stage 2: Intervention-Guided Pruning & Reweighting

#### Structural Pruning and Neuron Rewiring
We surgically remove high-spuriosity activations using:
1. **Magnitude-based Sparsity**: Freeze top-$k\%$ features by $R_{l,i}$ rank, mask activations during forward pass.
2. **Path-Based Merging**: Connect upstream-downstream weights around pruned units to preserve flow:
$$ W_{new} = W_{upstream}^T \cdot W_{downstream} \text{ s.t. } R_{l,i} > \tau $$

#### Contrastive Invariant Learning
To reinforce causal relationships post-pruning, we introduce an end-to-end training objective:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{task} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{contrastive}
$$
Where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{contrastive} = \sum_{x, x^+, x^-} \max\left(0, \text{sim}(e(x), e(x^-)) - \text{sim}(e(x), e(x^+)) + \delta\right)$
- Positive pairs $(x, x^+)$: Swapped counterfactuals with positive intervention outcomes.
- Negative pairs $(x, x^-)$: Same inputs with degraded outputs under interventions.

Encoder $e(\cdot)$ uses an adapter layer to preserve pretrained weights.

### Experimental Validation

#### Datasets and Benchmarks
We validate across three modalities:
1. **Text**: QA (TruthfulQA), Sentiment (Amazon+Yelp shifts), Bias (CoS-E).
2. **Vision**: MNIST-Shift (background color), Waterbirds (background context).
3. **Multimodal**: CLIP-related vision-language tasks (NLVR2, VQA).

#### Baseline Comparisons
Compare against causality-enhancing methods:
- **CCR**: Counterfactual calibration (Zhou et al., 2024)
- **SEraser**: Prompt-based top-down regularization (Ma et al., 2024)
- **IB-INLP**: Information bottleneck optimization
- **Default**: Raw Causal LLMs without intervention.

#### Evaluation Metrics
Quantitative metrics include:
1. **Hallucination Rate** (TRIDE-halluc): Proportion of factually incorrect answers.
2. **Domain Robustness**: Accuracy drop $\Delta_{OoD}$ under train/test distribution mismatch.
3. **Model Fairness**:
   - Demographic Parity Difference $\text{DPD}$.
   - Equal Opportunity Difference $\text{EED}$.
4. **Calibration**: Expected Calibration Error $\text{ECE}$.

#### Implementation
- Use LLaMA-300M and CLIP ViT-B/32 as base models (socra:learn2024).
- Perform ablation over pruning rates $k \in \{10\%, 30\%, 50\%\}$.
- Train with AdamW optimizer, $\lambda \in [0.1, 0.5]$, batch size 128, early stopping.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Technical Advancements
1. **Benchmark Performance**:
   - ≥25% reduction in factual hallucination (TruthfulQA absolute accuracy +8%).
   - Domain shift robustness $\Delta_{OoD}$ improved by 15–20%.
   - Calibration error $\text{ECE}$ reduced from 23.1 → 15.4.

2. **Spuriousness Discernment**:
   - Early-layer features (e.g., shallow MLPs, attention heads near [CLS]) show 3× higher $R_{l,i}$ scores than task-specific late-layer neurons.

3. **Architectural Insights**:
   - Adversarial readability in vision stems mainly from mid-layer vision transformers where contrastive regularization yields 38% accuracy gains.

### Societal and Scientific Impact
1. **Transparency Tools**:
   - Publicly release interpretable feature dashboards showing pruning priorities and intervention effects across modalities.

2. **Robust Foundation Models**:
   - Certified deployment pipelines for medical QA and radiology systems, verified against EU AI Act's non-discrimination mandates.

3. **Theoretical Contributions**:
   - Formal validation of the inductive bias of causal structure through path-wise interventions, explaining how sparsity interacts with credit assignment in large models.

4. **Interdisciplinary Applications**:
   - Collaborate with pharmaceutical partners for toxicity prediction where nonfactual extrapolations can endanger drug safety pathways.

### Addressing Literature Challenges
1. **Scalable Causal Discovery**: Our layer-wise attention intervention operates orders-of-magnitude faster than autoregressive generation-based analysis.
2. **Generalization**: Unified methodology applies seamlessly to text, vision, and diffusion workflows.
3. **Equity Tradeoffs**: By comparing $\mathcal{L}_{contrastive}$ dynamics versus fairness metrics, we identify toolkit combinations guaranteeing minimal bias amplification within 5-8% performance variance.
