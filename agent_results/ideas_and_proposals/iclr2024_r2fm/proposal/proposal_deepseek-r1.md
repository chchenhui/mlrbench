**Title**:  
**Intervention-Based Causal Pruning for Spurious Feature Removal in Foundation Models**  

---

### 1. Introduction  
**Background**  
Foundation models (FMs) like GPT-4 and CLIP demonstrate remarkable performance across tasks but often rely on spurious features—superficial correlations in training data—to make predictions. These features lead to unreliable outputs, including factual hallucinations, biased decisions, and poor generalization under distribution shifts. Existing methods, such as regularization or post-hoc prompt tuning (e.g., SEraser), mitigate these issues indirectly but lack a principled causal framework to systematically identify and remove spurious features. Causal inference offers a robust paradigm to disentangle true causal relationships from spurious associations, yet scaling such methods to FMs remains underexplored.  

**Research Objectives**  
1. Develop a causal attribution framework to identify spurious features in FMs through targeted interventions.  
2. Design a pruning and reweighting mechanism to eliminate spurious features while preserving causal dependencies.  
3. Validate the proposed method’s efficacy in reducing hallucinations, improving robustness, and enhancing fairness across benchmarks.  

**Significance**  
This work bridges the gap between causal inference and large-scale foundation models by providing a scalable, domain-agnostic solution to spurious feature removal. By aligning FMs with causal principles, the research addresses critical challenges in reliability, transparency, and ethical AI deployment, with applications ranging from healthcare to education.

### 2. Methodology  
#### 2.1. Research Design  

**Data Collection**  
- **Domains**:  
  - **Open-Domain QA**: TriviaQA (truthful vs. hallucinated answers).  
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: IMDb reviews with synthetic domain shifts (e.g., topic-controlled splits).  
  - **Bias Detection**: StereoSet (gender/racial stereotypes).  
- **Models**: Pre-trained FMs (BERT, GPT-2, LLaMA) fine-tuned on task-specific data.

#### 2.2. Stage 1: Causal Attribution via Interventions  
**Step 1: Feature Activation Extraction**  
For input $X$, extract hidden layer activations $\mathbf{h} = \{h_1, h_2, ..., h_d\}$ from the FM.  

**Step 2: Targeted Interventions**  
Apply three intervention types to each $h_i$:  
1. **Masking**: $h_i \gets 0$.  
2. **Scaling**: $h_i \gets \alpha h_i$ ($\alpha \in \{0.5, 1.5\}$).  
3. **Swapping**: Replace $h_i$ with its value from $\mathbf{h}_{X'}$, where $X'$ is a counterfactual input.  

**Step 3: Quantifying Causal Effect**  
Compute the effect of intervening on $h_i$ via divergence in output distribution:  
$$
\text{Spuriousness Score } S_i = \mathbb{E}_{X \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \text{KL}\left( P(y|X) \, \| \, P(y|\text{do}(h_i))\right) \right]
$$  
Features with high $S_i$ are flagged as spurious.

#### 2.3. Stage 2: Intervention-Guided Pruning  
**Step 1: Contrastive Training**  
Fine-tune the model using intervention-aware samples:  
- For each training batch $(X, y)$, generate counterfactuals $\tilde{X}$ by intervening on spurious features (masking $h_i$ where $S_i > \tau$).  
- Apply a contrastive loss to enforce invariance:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}} = -\log \frac{\exp(f(X) \cdot f(\tilde{X}^+))}{\sum_{\tilde{X}^-} \exp(f(X) \cdot f(\tilde{X}^-))}
$$  
where $\tilde{X}^+$ are interventions preserving causal features, and $\tilde{X}^-$ are spurious-only variants.  

**Step 2: Penalized Reweighting**  
Adjust model weights to suppress spurious features via regularization:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda \sum_{i: S_i > \tau} \| \mathbf{W}_i \|_2^2
$$  
where $\mathbf{W}_i$ are weights associated with $h_i$.

#### 2.4. Experimental Validation  
**Baselines**:  
1. SEraser (test-time prompt tuning).  
2. CCR (causal feature selection).  
3. Standard fine-tuning.  

**Metrics**:  
- **Hallucination Rate**: % of nonfactual answers in TriviaQA.  
- **OOD Accuracy**: Performance on domain-shifted sentiment tasks.  
- **Fairness**: Bias score from StereoSet.  
- **Calibration Error**: ECE (Expected Calibration Error).  

**Statistical Analysis**:  
- Paired t-tests across 5 seeds to evaluate significance.  
- Ablation studies on intervention types and pruning thresholds ($\tau$).

**Expected Outcomes**  
- **Quantitative**:  
  - 15–20% reduction in hallucination rates compared to baselines.  
  - 10–25% improvement in OOD generalization for sentiment analysis.  
  - 30% reduction in StereoSet bias scores.  
- **Qualitative**: Improved interpretability via feature attribution maps.  

**Impact**  
This work will provide:  
1. A scalable causal framework to improve FM reliability across domains.  
2. Open-source tools for spurious feature identification and pruning.  
3. Guidelines for integrating causal principles into FM training pipelines.  

By addressing spurious correlations at their root, this research aligns foundation models with human values and advances their adoption in high-stakes applications.
