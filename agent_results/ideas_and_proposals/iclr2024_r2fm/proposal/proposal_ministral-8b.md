# Intervention-Based Causal Pruning for Spurious Feature Removal in Foundation Models

## Introduction

Foundation models (FMs), such as large-scale language and vision models, have revolutionized various domains, from natural language processing to computer vision. However, these models often internalize spurious correlations from massive, noisy corpora, leading to hallucinations, biased outputs, and poor out-of-distribution generalization. Ensuring the reliability, transparency, and fairness of these models is crucial for their responsible deployment, particularly in critical applications like medicine and finance.

The primary objective of this research is to develop a two-stage intervention-based causal pruning approach to mitigate the harmful effects of spurious features in FMs. The proposed method involves:
1. **Causal attribution via targeted interventions**: Systematically masking, scaling, or swapping individual hidden activations to quantify each feature’s causal effect on key outputs.
2. **Intervention-guided pruning and reweighting**: Fine-tuning the model using contrastive training with samples that enforce causal invariance, attenuating or removing high-spuriousness features.

This proposal aims to enhance the reliability and transparency of foundation models, aligning them closer to human values and ensuring their responsible deployment in diverse applications.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The proposed methodology will be evaluated on a combination of open-domain QA datasets, sentiment analysis tasks under domain shift, and bias benchmarks. These datasets include:
- **Open-domain QA**: SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016)
- **Sentiment Analysis under Domain Shift**: IMDB (Maas et al., 2011) and Yelp (Zhang et al., 2015)
- **Bias Benchmarks**: StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2020)

### Causal Attribution via Targeted Interventions

#### Step 1: Intervention Design
To identify spurious features, we employ targeted interventions by systematically masking, scaling, or swapping individual hidden activations across diverse inputs. This process involves:
- **Masking**: Setting the activation of a specific neuron to zero.
- **Scaling**: Multiplying the activation of a specific neuron by a factor.
- **Swapping**: Replacing the activation of a specific neuron with that of another.

#### Step 2: Causal Effect Quantification
For each intervention, we measure the change in the model’s output on various metrics, such as factual correctness, sentiment, and bias. The causal effect of a feature is quantified as the difference in output before and after the intervention. Features whose interventions induce inconsistent or nonfactual behaviors are flagged as spurious.

### Intervention-Guided Pruning and Reweighting

#### Step 1: Contrastive Training
We fine-tune the model using contrastive training with samples that enforce causal invariance. This involves:
- **Positive Pairs**: Samples that share similar inputs but differ in a specific feature.
- **Negative Pairs**: Samples that share similar inputs but differ in multiple features.

The contrastive loss function can be defined as:
$$
L_{contrastive} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(f_i, f_i^+))}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(\text{sim}(f_i, f_j))}
$$
where $f_i$ is the feature vector of the positive pair, $f_i^+$ is the feature vector of the negative pair, and $\text{sim}$ denotes the similarity function.

#### Step 2: Feature Pruning and Reweighting
Based on the causal attribution results, we prune or reweight high-spuriousness features. This involves:
- **Pruning**: Removing the high-spuriousness features from the model.
- **Reweighting**: Adjusting the weights of high-spuriousness features to minimize their impact on the model’s output.

### Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we use the following metrics:
- **Hallucination Rate**: The proportion of incorrect or irrelevant outputs.
- **Calibration**: The agreement between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes.
- **Bias**: The difference in performance across different demographic groups.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Reduction in Hallucination Rates**: The proposed method aims to reduce hallucination rates by ~20% across various datasets.
2. **Improved Calibration**: The model’s predictions should be more accurate and consistent with the actual outcomes.
3. **Fairer Predictions**: The method should help mitigate biases in the model’s predictions, leading to fairer and more equitable outcomes.

### Impact

The successful development and deployment of this intervention-based causal pruning approach will have significant implications for the reliability, transparency, and fairness of foundation models. By reducing the harmful effects of spurious features, this method will enhance the trustworthiness of AI solutions and enable their responsible deployment in critical applications. Furthermore, the proposed approach offers a general, domain-agnostic method that can be applied to various foundation models and tasks, promoting broader adoption and integration into existing AI systems.

## Conclusion

The proposed intervention-based causal pruning approach addresses a critical challenge in the development of reliable and responsible foundation models. By systematically identifying and mitigating spurious features, this method aims to enhance the reliability, transparency, and fairness of these models, ensuring their responsible deployment in diverse applications. The expected outcomes and impact of this research will contribute to the broader goal of advancing the responsible design, deployment, and oversight of AI solutions, ultimately preserving societal norms, equity, and fairness.
