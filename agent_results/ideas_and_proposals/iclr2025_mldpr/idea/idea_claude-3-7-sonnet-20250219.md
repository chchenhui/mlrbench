# Holistic Dataset Impact Scoring Framework for ML Repositories

## Motivation
Current machine learning repositories often emphasize simplistic metrics like accuracy or F1 score, leading researchers to focus on these narrow indicators when selecting datasets. This one-dimensional evaluation approach has contributed to dataset overuse, benchmarking problems, and ethical blind spots. ML repositories need mechanisms to provide multidimensional assessments of datasets that reveal broader implications of their use, guiding researchers toward more responsible and diverse dataset selection.

## Main Idea
This research proposes a standardized "Dataset Impact Score" framework for ML repositories that evaluates datasets across five key dimensions: statistical quality, documentation completeness, ethical considerations, domain representation, and usage diversity. Each dimension would have quantifiable metrics (e.g., documentation completeness measured through schema adherence). Repositories would display these scores prominently alongside each dataset, with visual indicators highlighting potential concerns. The framework includes a feedback mechanism where dataset users can contribute validation data and usage reports, creating a dynamic evaluation system that evolves with community input. By implementing this scoring system across major repositories like HuggingFace and UCI, we can shift research culture away from simplistic benchmark chasing toward more holistic dataset selection that considers broader impacts, ultimately improving research diversity and reducing ethical problems in ML applications.
