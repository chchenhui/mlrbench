# Title: Benchmark Cards: Standardizing Context and Holistic Evaluation for ML Benchmarks

## Introduction

Machine learning (ML) benchmarks play a pivotal role in advancing the field by providing standardized metrics for model evaluation. However, current benchmarking practices often rely on single aggregate metrics, such as accuracy, which can lead to a narrow focus on optimization for leaderboards rather than comprehensive model understanding. This approach neglects crucial aspects like fairness across subgroups, robustness to distribution shifts, and efficiency, hindering the selection of truly suitable models for real-world, contextualized applications.

To address these issues, we propose "Benchmark Cards," a standardized documentation framework accompanying ML benchmarks. Analogous to Model Cards, these cards will detail the benchmark's intended evaluation context and scope, key characteristics and potential biases of the underlying dataset(s), a recommended suite of holistic evaluation metrics beyond the primary leaderboard metric, known limitations, and potential misuse scenarios. This framework aims to shift the focus from single-score rankings to multi-faceted, context-aware model assessment, promoting more responsible and informative benchmarking practices within the ML community. We will develop a template and populate initial cards for popular benchmarks.

### Research Objectives

1. **Develop a standardized documentation framework**: Create a template for "Benchmark Cards" that provides a consistent structure for documenting ML benchmarks.
2. **Enhance contextual understanding**: Detail the intended evaluation context and scope of each benchmark to ensure models are evaluated in relevant scenarios.
3. **Promote holistic evaluation**: Recommend a suite of holistic evaluation metrics that go beyond primary leaderboard metrics, including fairness, robustness, and efficiency.
4. **Identify limitations and misuse scenarios**: Document known limitations and potential misuse scenarios to inform responsible model deployment.
5. **Evaluate the impact of Benchmark Cards**: Assess the effectiveness of the framework by comparing the performance and suitability of models evaluated with and without Benchmark Cards.

### Significance

The development of Benchmark Cards addresses several critical gaps in current ML benchmarking practices. By standardizing documentation and promoting holistic evaluation, the framework enhances transparency, reproducibility, and comparability of model assessments. This shift towards more responsible benchmarking practices is essential for advancing the field and ensuring that ML models are suitable for real-world applications.
