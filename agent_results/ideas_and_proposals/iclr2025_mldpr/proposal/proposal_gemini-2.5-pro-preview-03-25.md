**1. Title:** Benchmark Cards: A Framework for Standardized Contextualization and Holistic Evaluation of Machine Learning Benchmarks

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Machine learning (ML) benchmarks are fundamental tools driving progress in the field. They provide standardized datasets and evaluation protocols, enabling researchers to compare model performance, track advancements, and identify promising techniques (Bommasani et al., 2021; Dodge et al., 2019). Major data repositories like Hugging Face Datasets, OpenML, and the UCI ML Repository serve as crucial hubs for hosting and disseminating these benchmarks, shaping research directions and influencing model development practices.

However, the current benchmarking paradigm faces significant challenges, as highlighted in the call for this workshop and echoed in recent literature. A pervasive issue is the overemphasis on single aggregate performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) presented on leaderboards (Sculley et al., 2018; Gebru et al., 2021). This narrow focus often obscures critical aspects of model behavior, leading to "leaderboard hacking" where models excel on the specific benchmark distribution but fail to generalize or exhibit undesirable properties in real-world deployment (Recht et al., 2019). Key limitations include:

*   **Lack of Context:** Benchmarks are often used without sufficient understanding of their intended scope, the characteristics and potential biases of the underlying datasets, or the specific capabilities they are designed to measure (Paullada et al., 2021).
*   **Insufficient Holistic Evaluation:** Important dimensions like fairness across demographic subgroups, robustness to distribution shifts or adversarial perturbations, computational efficiency (latency, memory, FLOPs), calibration, and potential toxicity are frequently neglected in standard benchmark reporting (Liang et al., 2022; Li et al., 2024).
*   **Inadequate Documentation Standards:** There is a lack of standardized frameworks for documenting benchmarks themselves, making it difficult to consistently assess their suitability, limitations, and the broader implications of results obtained on them. While frameworks like Datasheets for Datasets (Gebru et al., 2021) and Model Cards (Mitchell et al., 2018) address documentation for datasets and models respectively, a comparable standard for the *benchmarks* (the combination of dataset(s), tasks, metrics, and protocols) is missing.
*   **Benchmark Overuse and Stagnation:** The reliance on a few dominant benchmarks can lead to overfitting by the research community and hinder progress on tasks or data modalities not represented by these popular benchmarks (Torralba & Efros, 2011).

These shortcomings contribute to a disconnect between benchmark performance and real-world utility, potentially leading to the deployment of models that are unreliable, unfair, or inefficient for their intended applications. Addressing these issues requires a shift towards more comprehensive, transparent, and context-aware benchmarking practices.

**2.2 Research Objectives**
Inspired by the success and philosophy of Model Cards (Mitchell et al., 2018), this research proposes the development and initial implementation of "Benchmark Cards," a standardized documentation framework specifically designed for ML benchmarks. The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Define the Structure and Content of Benchmark Cards:** To develop a comprehensive template that captures essential information for understanding and responsibly using an ML benchmark. This includes its intended context, dataset characteristics, evaluation protocols, a recommended suite of holistic metrics, and known limitations.
2.  **Develop a Standardized Benchmark Card Template:** To create a practical, shareable template (e.g., in Markdown or structured formats like JSON/YAML) that facilitates consistent documentation across different benchmarks and research communities.
3.  **Populate Initial Benchmark Cards for Key Benchmarks:** To demonstrate the utility and feasibility of the framework by creating Benchmark Cards for several widely used and diverse ML benchmarks (e.g., spanning vision, language, tabular data).
4.  **Promote Contextualized and Holistic Evaluation:** To advocate for a shift in the ML community's evaluation practices, moving beyond single-metric leaderboards towards multi-faceted assessments informed by the context provided in Benchmark Cards.
5.  **Facilitate Repository Integration:** To explore pathways for integrating Benchmark Cards into ML data and benchmark repositories, enhancing discoverability and promoting responsible benchmark usage.

**2.3 Significance**
This research holds significant potential to improve the integrity, transparency, and real-world relevance of ML research and development. By introducing Benchmark Cards, we aim to:

*   **Enhance Transparency and Reproducibility:** Provide researchers and practitioners with a clear, standardized understanding of what a benchmark measures, its underlying data assumptions, and its limitations.
*   **Promote Responsible Model Evaluation:** Encourage a move beyond optimizing single metrics towards holistic assessment, considering fairness, robustness, efficiency, and other critical factors relevant to real-world deployment contexts, aligning with frameworks like HELM (Liang et al., 2022) and HEM (Li et al., 2024).
*   **Improve Model Selection:** Enable more informed decisions about model suitability for specific applications by providing richer contextual information alongside performance metrics.
*   **Inform Benchmark Design and Curation:** Highlight gaps and limitations in existing benchmarks, potentially guiding the development of future benchmarks with more explicit goals and better documentation.
*   **Strengthen Repository Practices:** Offer data repositories a concrete mechanism to improve the documentation and contextualization of the benchmarks they host, addressing key challenges outlined in the workshop call regarding comprehensive documentation, benchmark reproducibility, and holistic benchmarking.
*   **Contribute to FAIR Principles:** Enhance the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) of benchmarks by providing standardized metadata and context.

Ultimately, this work seeks to foster a much-needed culture shift in how the ML community interacts with, evaluates on, and reports results from benchmarks, leading to more reliable, responsible, and societally beneficial AI systems.

**3. Methodology**

This research will be conducted in four main phases: Framework Definition and Template Design, Benchmark Selection and Information Gathering, Benchmark Card Population, and Validation and Dissemination.

**3.1 Phase 1: Framework Definition and Template Design**
This phase focuses on defining the core components of a Benchmark Card and designing a practical template.

*   **Component Identification:** Based on the initial idea, literature review (Mitchell et al., 2018; Liang et al., 2022; Gebru et al., 2021), and the challenges identified, we will define the essential sections of a Benchmark Card. Tentative sections include:
    *   **Benchmark Identification:** Name, version, citation, date, maintainers, relevant URLs (repository, leaderboard, paper).
    *   **Intended Use & Scope:** Target task(s), domain(s), capabilities measured (e.g., classification accuracy, generative quality, robustness to X), intended user communities, out-of-scope applications.
    *   **Dataset(s) Summary:** Links to detailed dataset documentation (e.g., Datasheets), key characteristics (size, modality, collection process summary), known limitations and biases (demographic, annotation artifacts, sampling issues), licensing information.
    *   **Evaluation Protocol:** Description of task setup, data splits (train/validation/test), standard evaluation code/environment (if applicable).
    *   **Primary Metric(s):** The main metric(s) commonly used for leaderboard ranking (e.g., Accuracy, BLEU score). Definition and justification.
    *   **Recommended Holistic Metrics Suite:** A curated set of additional metrics crucial for comprehensive understanding. This will be context-dependent but draw from established categories:
        *   *Accuracy/Performance Breakdowns:* Performance on critical subgroups (e.g., based on demographics, data frequency), calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error - ECE).
        *   *Fairness:* Relevant fairness metrics based on task and data (e.g., Demographic Parity Difference (DPD), Equalized Odds Difference (EOD), disparate impact). For example:
            $$ DPD = |P(\hat{Y}=1 | A=a) - P(\hat{Y}=1 | A=b)| $$
            Where $\hat{Y}$ is the predicted outcome and $A$ represents sensitive attributes $a$ and $b$.
        *   *Robustness:* Performance under specific distribution shifts (e.g., covariate shift, label shift), performance on out-of-distribution samples, robustness to common corruptions (e.g., ImageNet-C benchmarks), adversarial robustness (e.g., PGD attack success rate).
        *   *Efficiency:* Computational cost (e.g., FLOPs, training time), inference latency, memory footprint, model size.
        *   *Other (Task-Specific):* E.g., Toxicity scores for language models, interpretability metric scores, slice-based evaluations.
    *   **Known Limitations & Potential Misuse:** Documented issues (e.g., benchmark saturation, dataset artifacts exploited by models), potential for Goodhart's Law effects, scenarios where high performance may be misleading, ethical considerations beyond dataset biases.
    *   **Benchmark Maintenance:** Versioning information, update/deprecation policy (if known).
*   **Template Design:** We will develop a template using a widely accessible format like Markdown, potentially supplemented by a structured format (JSON Schema or YAML) for machine readability and integration into platforms. The design will prioritize clarity, conciseness, and ease of use for both benchmark creators filling it out and users reading it. Visual layout considerations will be made for potential web rendering.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** The initial template will be refined based on internal review and potentially through informal consultations with a small group of ML researchers and benchmark maintainers.

**3.2 Phase 2: Benchmark Selection and Information Gathering**
This phase involves selecting initial benchmarks for card creation and gathering the necessary information.

*   **Benchmark Selection Criteria:** We will select 3-5 popular and diverse benchmarks covering different data modalities and tasks (e.g., image classification like CIFAR-10/ImageNet, natural language understanding like GLUE/SuperGLUE, object detection like COCO, question answering like SQuAD, possibly a tabular data benchmark). Selection criteria include: wide usage in the community, availability of information, representation of different evaluation challenges (e.g., known biases, robustness concerns), and potential impact of improved documentation.
*   **Information Gathering:** For each selected benchmark, we will systematically collect information relevant to the Benchmark Card sections. This involves:
    *   Reviewing the original benchmark papers and associated documentation.
    *   Consulting dataset documentation (e.g., existing Datasheets).
    *   Searching literature for studies analyzing the benchmark's properties (e.g., bias analyses, robustness studies, artifact detection).
    *   Examining public leaderboards and common reporting practices.
    *   Investigating discussions in the community (e.g., forums, blogs, workshops) regarding the benchmark's limitations or usage.

**3.3 Phase 3: Benchmark Card Population**
Using the gathered information and the designed template, we will populate the Benchmark Cards for the selected benchmarks.

*   **Systematic Population:** We will meticulously fill each section of the template for every chosen benchmark. This requires careful synthesis of information from diverse sources.
*   **Justifying Holistic Metrics:** For the "Recommended Holistic Metrics Suite" section, we will justify the inclusion of specific metrics based on the benchmark's characteristics, task type, known issues reported in the literature, and relevance to responsible AI principles (e.g., selecting specific fairness metrics based on potential demographic biases identified in the dataset analysis). We will reference established work defining these metrics (e.g., Verma & Rubin, 2018 for fairness; Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019 for robustness).
*   **Consistency and Rigor:** We will strive for consistency in the level of detail and rigor across the different cards, while acknowledging that the available information may vary between benchmarks. Source attribution will be maintained where specific findings or limitations are documented.

**3.4 Phase 4: Validation and Dissemination**
This phase focuses on evaluating the utility of the Benchmark Cards and promoting their adoption.

*   **Expert Review:** We will solicit feedback on the populated Benchmark Cards and the template itself from experts in ML, benchmarking, AI ethics, and data curation, including potentially reaching out to maintainers of data repositories (as relevant to the workshop). Feedback will be gathered on clarity, completeness, usefulness, and feasibility. Qualitative analysis of feedback will guide further template refinement.
*   **User Study (Potential Extension):** If resources permit, a small user study could be designed. Participants (ML researchers/students) would be asked to perform tasks (e.g., selecting a model for a hypothetical scenario, interpreting benchmark results) using information presented with and without the accompanying Benchmark Card. Metrics could include task success rate, decision confidence, time taken, and qualitative feedback on the Card's utility via surveys (e.g., using the System Usability Scale - SUS).
*   **Dissemination:**
    *   Publish the Benchmark Card template and the populated examples in an open-source repository (e.g., GitHub) under a permissive license (e.g., CC BY-SA 4.0).
    *   Prepare a manuscript detailing the framework, methodology, populated examples, and validation results for submission to a relevant ML conference or journal, and specifically for presentation at "The Future of Machine Learning Data Practices and Repositories" workshop.
    *   Engage with data repository maintainers (e.g., Hugging Face, Papers With Code, OpenML) to discuss potential integration of Benchmark Card concepts or fields into their platforms.

**3.5 Evaluation Metrics (for this Research Project)**
The success of this research project itself will be evaluated based on:

*   **Completion of Deliverables:** Successful creation of the Benchmark Card template and populated cards for the selected benchmarks.
*   **Quality of Framework:** Assessed through expert feedback regarding the framework's comprehensiveness, clarity, and potential utility.
*   **User Perception (if user study conducted):** Quantitative metrics (SUS scores, task performance) and qualitative feedback on usefulness and clarity.
*   **Community Reception:** Initial feedback and potential uptake indicators following dissemination (e.g., repository interest, citations, community contributions to the open-source project).
