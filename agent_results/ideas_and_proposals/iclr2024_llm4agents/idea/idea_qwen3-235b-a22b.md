1. **Title**: **Self-Supervised Grounding in LLM Agents via Interactive Tool Learning and Environmental Feedback**  
2. **Motivation**: LLM agents often fail to ground language in real-world contexts, leading to misaligned actions in dynamic environments. Existing methods rely on static pretraining or limited tool integration, which hampers adaptability. Addressing this gap could enable agents to robustly link language to environmental interactions, enhancing reliability in real-world applications like robotics or autonomous systems.  
3. **Main Idea**: Propose a self-supervised framework where LLM agents learn grounding through trial-and-error interaction with tools in diverse simulated environments. The agent receives multimodal feedback (e.g., visual, tactile) after each action, which updates its linguistic representations via contrastive learning. A dual-memory system stores successful/unsuccessful interaction trajectories, enabling meta-learning of grounding patterns. Reinforcement learning with sparse rewards (task success) and unsupervised consistency losses (e.g., aligning tool affordances with language) drive the agent to discover causal links between instructions, tool use, and environmental outcomes. Expected outcomes include agents that generalize grounding to unseen tools/contexts, reducing errors in real-world deployments. This could advance autonomous systems requiring precise language-to-action mapping, such as industrial automation or assistive robotics.
