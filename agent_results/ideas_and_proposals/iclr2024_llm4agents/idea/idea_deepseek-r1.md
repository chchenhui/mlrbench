**Title:** Dynamic Cross-Modal Grounding for Enhanced Environmental Interaction in LLM Agents  

**Motivation:** Current LLM agents primarily operate in text-only domains, limiting their ability to perceive and interact with the physical world. Bridging language with multi-sensory inputs (vision, sound, touch) is critical for enabling agents to autonomously execute complex tasks in real-world environments, such as household robotics or assistive technologies, where contextual and perceptual grounding is essential.  

**Main Idea:** Develop an LLM agent architecture that dynamically integrates visual, auditory, and tactile inputs with linguistic reasoning. The framework will use adaptive attention mechanisms to weigh modalities based on task contextâ€”e.g., prioritizing audio when locating a "ringing phone" and vision for navigation. The model will be trained on multi-task datasets with aligned text, images, sounds, and tactile data, leveraging contrastive learning to map concepts across modalities. For grounding, agents will learn to associate linguistic cues (e.g., "hot") with sensory signals (thermal sensors). Expected outcomes include improved accuracy in real-world task completion (e.g., 20-30% gains in multi-step benchmarks) and robust cross-modal reasoning. This could enable applications like assistive robots that interpret ambiguous commands by synthesizing multi-sensory context.
