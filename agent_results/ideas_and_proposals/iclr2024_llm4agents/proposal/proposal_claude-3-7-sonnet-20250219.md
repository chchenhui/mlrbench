# Semantic Memory Architecture with Adaptive Forgetting for Enhanced LLM Agent Cognition

## Introduction

Large Language Model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools capable of performing complex tasks through natural language interaction. These agents can reason, plan, and execute instructions across various domains. However, a significant limitation hampers their effectiveness during extended interactions: memory management. Current LLM agents face a fundamental cognitive constraint - they either forget critical information as conversations extend beyond their context window or become overwhelmed with excessive contextual data, leading to degraded performance and response quality.

This memory challenge stands in stark contrast to human cognition, which employs sophisticated mechanisms to selectively forget irrelevant information while preserving important concepts. The human memory system performs continuous consolidation, where episodic memories are gradually transformed into semantic knowledge structures, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of information over extended periods. This biological process is precisely what current LLM agents lack.

The research objective of this proposal is to develop a biologically-inspired semantic memory architecture with intelligent forgetting capabilities for LLM agents. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Design a dual-pathway memory architecture that hierarchically organizes concepts and their relationships in a semantic network while implementing biologically-plausible forgetting mechanisms.
2. Develop algorithms that dynamically prune and consolidate memories based on recency, relevance, and importance metrics derived from interaction contexts.
3. Implement a reinforcement learning approach to optimize the forgetting parameters based on task performance and user feedback.
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of this architecture across diverse long-running tasks, including research assistance, multi-session planning, and extended conversational interactions.

The significance of this research extends beyond simply improving LLM agent performance. By addressing the memory limitations of current models, this work will advance our understanding of cognitive architectures for artificial intelligence systems. The proposed semantic memory architecture with adaptive forgetting could potentially bridge the gap between episodic task execution and long-term knowledge retention in AI systems, enabling more human-like interactions across extended timeframes. Furthermore, the biological inspiration behind this work may yield insights into the computational principles underlying human memory processes, contributing to both AI and cognitive science.

## Methodology

Our proposed methodology encompasses a comprehensive approach to developing and evaluating a semantic memory architecture with adaptive forgetting for LLM agents. We detail the system architecture, algorithms, and experimental design below.

### 1. System Architecture

The proposed system consists of four main components:

**1.1 Dual-Pathway Memory Architecture**

We will implement a dual-pathway memory system inspired by cognitive neuroscience models:

a) **Episodic Buffer**: Captures immediate conversation history and context in its raw form, storing recent interactions temporarily.

b) **Semantic Network**: Organized as a hierarchical graph structure where:
   - Nodes represent concepts, entities, and relationships
   - Edges represent semantic connections with weighted importance
   - Each node contains embedded information derived from the LLM's understanding

The semantic network will be implemented using the following structure:

$$G = (V, E, W)$$

Where:
- $V$ is the set of concept nodes
- $E$ is the set of edges between related concepts
- $W$ is a weight matrix representing the strength and importance of connections

**1.2 Memory Encoding and Consolidation Module**

This module transforms raw interaction data from the episodic buffer into structured semantic representations:

a) **Embedding Generation**: For an input text sequence $X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}$, we extract embeddings using the LLM's internal representations:

$$E(X) = \text{LLM}_{\text{embed}}(X)$$

b) **Entity and Concept Extraction**: We identify key entities and concepts using:

$$C = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_m\} = \text{ExtractConcepts}(X, \text{LLM})$$

c) **Semantic Network Integration**: New concepts are integrated into the existing semantic network through a consolidation function:

$$G_{t+1} = \text{Consolidate}(G_t, C, E(X))$$

The consolidation function creates new nodes for novel concepts, updates existing nodes with new information, and establishes or strengthens connections between related concepts.

**1.3 Adaptive Forgetting Mechanism**

This component implements biologically-inspired forgetting algorithms:

a) **Importance Scoring**: Each node $v_i \in V$ receives an importance score $I(v_i)$ calculated as:

$$I(v_i) = \alpha \cdot R(v_i) + \beta \cdot F(v_i) + \gamma \cdot C(v_i)$$

Where:
- $R(v_i)$ is the recency of access (time decay function)
- $F(v_i)$ is the frequency of access (usage count)
- $C(v_i)$ is the centrality within the semantic network
- $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are weighting parameters optimized through reinforcement learning

b) **Ebbinghaus-Inspired Decay**: Information retention follows an exponential decay curve:

$$R(v_i) = e^{-\lambda \cdot (t - t_{\text{last}})}$$

Where:
- $t$ is the current time step
- $t_{\text{last}}$ is the last access time
- $\lambda$ is the decay rate parameter

c) **Pruning Algorithm**: Nodes below a threshold importance score are candidates for forgetting:

$$V_{\text{forget}} = \{v_i \in V | I(v_i) < \theta_{\text{forget}}\}$$

d) **Memory Consolidation**: Rather than complete deletion, low-importance detailed memories are compressed into more generalized concepts:

$$v_{\text{general}} = \text{Compress}(\{v_i, v_j, ..., v_k\})$$

Where multiple related low-importance nodes are merged into a single generalized concept node.

**1.4 Retrieval and Integration Module**

When responding to user queries or performing tasks, the system retrieves relevant information:

a) **Query Embedding**: Convert user query $Q$ to embedding:

$$E(Q) = \text{LLM}_{\text{embed}}(Q)$$

b) **Relevance Scoring**: Calculate relevance scores for all nodes:

$$S(v_i, Q) = \text{CosineSimilarity}(E(v_i), E(Q))$$

c) **Context Generation**: Retrieve top-k most relevant nodes and generate a synthesized context:

$$\text{Context} = \text{Synthesize}(\{v_i | \text{TopK}(S(v_i, Q))\})$$

d) **Response Generation**: The LLM generates responses using both the current query and the synthesized context:

$$\text{Response} = \text{LLM}_{\text{generate}}(Q, \text{Context})$$

### 2. Reinforcement Learning Optimization

We will optimize the forgetting parameters through reinforcement learning:

a) **State Representation**: The state includes the current semantic network structure, query embeddings, and task context.

b) **Action Space**: Actions include adjusting forgetting parameters $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \lambda, \theta_{\text{forget}})$ within defined ranges.

c) **Reward Function**: The reward is based on a combination of:

$$R(a_t, s_t) = w_1 \cdot \text{ResponseQuality} + w_2 \cdot \text{MemoryEfficiency} - w_3 \cdot \text{InformationLoss}$$

Where:
- ResponseQuality is measured through automatic metrics and user feedback
- MemoryEfficiency quantifies the compactness of the semantic network
- InformationLoss measures critical information retention

d) **Optimization Algorithm**: We will employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn optimal parameter settings:

$$\theta_{t+1} = \arg\max_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{s,a \sim \pi_{\theta_t}}[L^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta)]$$

Where:

$$L^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{s,a \sim \pi_{\theta_t}}[\min(r_t(\theta) A^{\pi_{\theta_t}}(s,a), \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) A^{\pi_{\theta_t}}(s,a))]$$

And $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a|s)}{\pi_{\theta_t}(a|s)}$ is the probability ratio.

### 3. Experimental Design and Evaluation

We will evaluate our system through a series of carefully designed experiments:

**3.1 Tasks and Datasets**

We will use the following tasks to evaluate our system:

a) **Long-term Research Assistant Task**: The agent assists with research on a specific topic over multiple sessions spanning days/weeks, requiring retention of accumulated knowledge.

b) **Multi-session Planning**: The agent helps plan a complex project (e.g., event planning, trip itinerary) across multiple interactive sessions.

c) **Extended Factual Dialogues**: Conversations requiring retention and integration of factual information over extended periods.

d) **Knowledge Evolution Task**: The agent must update its understanding as new information contradicts or builds upon previous knowledge.

We will compare our system against:
1. Standard LLM with fixed context window
2. Vector database retrieval augmentation (RAG)
3. RecallM memory architecture
4. MemoryBank system

a) **Memory Retention Score**: Measures how well critical information is preserved:

$$\text{MRS} = \frac{\text{Number of critical facts correctly recalled}}{\text{Total number of critical facts introduced}}$$

b) **Forgetting Precision**: Evaluates how effectively irrelevant information is pruned:

$$\text{FP} = \frac{\text{Number of irrelevant items forgotten}}{\text{Total number of items forgotten}}$$

c) **Coherence Score**: Assesses the logical consistency of agent responses across sessions.

d) **Task Completion Accuracy**: Measures the correctness of completed tasks requiring long-term memory.

e) **Computational Efficiency**: Quantifies the memory and processing requirements compared to baselines.

f) **Human Evaluation**: User ratings on perceived intelligence, helpfulness, and human-likeness.

**3.4 Experimental Protocol**

1. **Training Phase**: Train the RL optimization system on a subset of tasks.
2. **Validation Phase**: Test on held-out validation tasks to tune hyperparameters.
3. **Testing Phase**: Evaluate on completely unseen test tasks.
4. **Ablation Studies**: Systematically remove components of the system to assess their contribution.
5. **Human Interaction Studies**: Conduct trials with human users interacting with the system over extended periods.

For each experiment, we will track:
- Semantic network growth/pruning over time
