# Graph Neural Surrogate-Driven GFlowNets for Black-Box Discrete Sampling  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Sampling and optimization in discrete spaces are fundamental challenges in machine learning, with applications ranging from molecular design to language model fine-tuning. Traditional methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and reinforcement learning often struggle with high computational costs, especially when evaluating black-box objectives (e.g., protein binding energy or language model likelihoods) requires expensive simulations or human feedback. Recent advances in Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have shown promise in generating diverse, high-reward candidates by learning stochastic policies that match a target distribution. However, their efficiency degrades in high-dimensional spaces with long-range correlations, where gradient information is unavailable and objective evaluations are costly.  

### Research Objectives  
This work aims to develop a novel framework that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) as surrogate models with GFlowNets to address two critical challenges:  
1. **Reducing the number of expensive true-objective evaluations** by training a GNN to approximate the energy landscape and guide exploration.  
2. **Capturing high-order correlations** in discrete structures (e.g., molecular graphs, text sequences) through graph-based representations and iterative surrogate refinement.  

### Significance  
The proposed method bridges the gap between surrogate-driven optimization and flow-based sampling, enabling efficient exploration of combinatorial spaces in black-box settings. Successful implementation would accelerate discovery in domains like protein engineering, where each wet-lab experiment is time-consuming, and language model alignment, where human-in-the-loop feedback is limited.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Framework Overview  
The framework alternates between three phases:  
1. **Surrogate Training**: A GNN learns an energy function $f_{\text{GNN}}(x)$ from a seed dataset of $(x, f_{\text{true}}(x))$ pairs.  
2. **GFlowNet Sampling**: The GFlowNet generates candidates using pseudo-rewards derived from $f_{\text{GNN}}$.  
3. **Active Learning**: High-uncertainty or high-reward candidates are selected for true-objective evaluation to refine the surrogate.  

### 2.2 Graph Neural Surrogate Model  

**Architecture**:  
- **Input**: Discrete structure $x$ (e.g., molecular graph, text token sequence) encoded as a graph.  
- **Encoder**: A message-passing GNN computes node embeddings $h_v$ and graph-level embedding $h_G$.  
- **Energy Prediction**: A multilayer perceptron (MLP) maps $h_G$ to a scalar energy:  
  $$f_{\text{GNN}}(x) = \text{MLP}\left(\sum_{v \in \mathcal{V}} h_v\right)$$  

**Training**:  
The GNN minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) over the seed dataset $\mathcal{D}_{\text{seed}}$:  
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{surrogate}} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}_{\text{seed}}|} \sum_{(x, y) \in \mathcal{D}_{\text{seed}}} \left(f_{\text{GNN}}(x) - y\right)^2,$$  
where $y = f_{\text{true}}(x)$.  

### 2.3 GFlowNet Sampling with Surrogate Guidance  

**State and Action Space**:  
- **State**: Partially constructed discrete object (e.g., partial molecular graph).  
- **Action**: Addition/removal of a component (e.g., atom, token).  

**Reward Definition**:  
The reward $R(x)$ for a complete object $x$ is derived from the surrogate:  
$$R(x) = \exp\left(-\beta \cdot f_{\text{GNN}}(x)\right),$$  
where $\beta$ is an inverse temperature parameter.  

**Flow Matching Objective**:  
The GFlowNet learns a policy $\pi_\theta(a | s)$ to satisfy the flow matching condition:  
$$\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} F(s, a) = R(s) + \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} F(s', a') \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S},$$  
where $F(s, a)$ is the learned flow for taking action $a$ in state $s$.  

### 2.4 Active Learning and Surrogate Update  

**Uncertainty Quantification**:  
The GNN’s uncertainty for a candidate $x$ is estimated via Monte Carlo dropout:  
$$\text{Uncertainty}(x) = \text{Var}\left(\{f_{\text{GNN}}^{(k)}(x)\}_{k=1}^K\right),$$  
where $f_{\text{GNN}}^{(k)}$ is the $k$-th forward pass with dropout enabled.  

**Query Strategy**:  
Select candidates $x$ maximizing the acquisition function:  
$$\alpha(x) = \underbrace{f_{\text{GNN}}(x)}_{\text{Exploitation}} + \lambda \cdot \underbrace{\text{Uncertainty}(x)}_{\text{Exploration}},$$  
where $\lambda$ balances exploration and exploitation.  

**Surrogate Retraining**:  
Newly evaluated samples are added to $\mathcal{D}_{\text{seed}}$, and the GNN is fine-tuned with a lower learning rate to avoid catastrophic forgetting.  

### 2.5 Reward Recalibration  

To correct surrogate bias, the GFlowNet’s rewards are periodically adjusted using importance weights:  
$$\tilde{R}(x) = R(x) \cdot \frac{f_{\text{true}}(x)}{f_{\text{GNN}}(x)}.$$  
This ensures the policy gradually aligns with the true objective.  

### 2.6 Algorithm Pseudocode  
1. Initialize $\mathcal{D}_{\text{seed}}$ with random samples evaluated on $f_{\text{true}}$.  
2. **While** budget for true evaluations not exhausted:  
   a. Train $f_{\text{GNN}}$ on $\mathcal{D}_{\text{seed}}$.  
   b. Train GFlowNet policy $\pi_\theta$ using $R(x) = \exp(-\beta f_{\text{GNN}}(x))$.  
   c. Generate candidates $\{x_i\}$ via $\pi_\theta$, compute $\alpha(x_i)$.  
   d. Select top-$k$ candidates by $\alpha(x_i)$, evaluate on $f_{\text{true}}$, add to $\mathcal{D}_{\text{seed}}$.  
   e. Update $\pi_\theta$ using $\tilde{R}(x)$ for newly evaluated samples.  

### 2.7 Experimental Design  

**Baselines**:  
- Vanilla GFlowNets  
- MCMC with simulated annealing  
- Bayesian optimization with tree-structured Parzen estimators (TPE)  

**Datasets**:  
- **Protein Design**: ProteinMPNN dataset with binding energy as $f_{\text{true}}$.  
- **Combinatorial Optimization**: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances with tour lengths as rewards.  
- **Language Model Sampling**: Diverse text generation conditioned on perplexity and style metrics.  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
1. **Sample Quality**: Top-$k$ reward/energy.  
2. **Diversity**: Jensen-Shannon divergence between generated and ground-truth distributions.  
3. **Efficiency**: Number of $f_{\text{true}}$ evaluations required to reach target performance.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Expected Outcomes  
1. **Reduced Query Complexity**: The GNN surrogate will reduce true-objective evaluations by 50–70% compared to vanilla GFlowNets, as demonstrated on protein design tasks.  
2. **Improved Sample Diversity**: The graph-based representation and active learning will capture high-order correlations, achieving 20% higher diversity scores in text generation than MCMC.  
3. **Superior Optimization**: The framework will outperform Bayesian optimization in TSP instances by 15% in solution quality under fixed query budgets.  

### Broader Impact  
The method’s ability to handle black-box objectives with complex dependencies will accelerate scientific discovery:  
- **Drug Discovery**: Rapid screening of molecular candidates with desired binding affinities.  
- **AI Alignment**: Efficient fine-tuning of language models using human feedback.  
- **Compiler Optimization**: Automated exploration of device placement strategies for distributed training.  

By open-sourcing the framework and partnering with bioengineering labs, we aim to democratize access to advanced discrete optimization tools while addressing real-world challenges.
