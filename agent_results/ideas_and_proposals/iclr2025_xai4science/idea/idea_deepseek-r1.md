**Title:**-Hoc Attribution-Hoc Attribution Maps for Uncovering Latent Biomarkers in Medical Imaging  

**Motivation:** Deep learning models in healthcare often operate as "black boxes," limiting trust and hindering their potential to reveal novel biomedical insights. While they achieve high diagnostic accuracy, clinicians cannot reliably act on predictions without understanding the rationale, and latent patterns detected by models may remain unexplored. This research aims to bridge this gap by leveraging post-hoc interpretability to both validate model behavior and discover unrecognized biomarkers in medical imaging.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a framework that applies post-hoc attribution methods (e.g., Grad-CAM, SHAP) to medical imaging models, generating heatmaps highlighting regions influencing predictions. These heatmaps will be systematically analyzed by clinicians to distinguish known biomarkers from unexplained salient regions. Unexplained regions will undergo rigorous validation via retrospective patient data analysis (e.g., correlating with treatment outcomes, lab tests) and prospective studies. The methodology integrates iterative feedback between ML engineers and domain experts, ensuring explanations are clinically grounded. Expected outcomes include: (1) improved model trustworthiness via human-validated explanations, (2) identification of novel imaging biomarkers for diseases like cancer or neurological disorders, and (3) a protocol for converting model attributions into testable scientific hypotheses. This approach could accelerate medical discovery while fostering responsible AI adoption in healthcare.
