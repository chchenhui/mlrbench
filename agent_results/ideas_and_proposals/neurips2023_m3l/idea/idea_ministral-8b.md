### Title: Bridging the Gap: Continuous Approximations for Deep Learning Optimization

### Motivation
The current optimization landscape for deep learning is fraught with uncertainty and high computational costs, especially with the advent of large models. While the Edge of Stability (EoS) and gradient noise have been studied, a more nuanced understanding of training dynamics is needed. This research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical deep learning by leveraging continuous approximations of training trajectories.

### Main Idea
The proposed research focuses on approximating discrete-time gradient dynamics with continuous counterparts, such as gradient flow or stochastic differential equations (SDEs). By doing so, we can gain insights into the behavior of optimization algorithms beyond the stable regime and understand the impact of large learning rates and gradient noise.

The methodology involves:
1. **Continuous Approximation**: Develop techniques to approximate discrete-time gradient dynamics with continuous-time models.
2. **Validation**: Empirically validate the accuracy of these approximations against actual training trajectories.
3. **Analysis**: Analyze the convergence properties and stability of these continuous models under different learning rate schedules and gradient noise levels.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved theoretical understanding of deep learning optimization dynamics.
- Practical guidelines for choosing hyperparameters and learning rate schedules.
- Enhanced convergence analysis tools for large-scale models.

Potential impact:
- Reduced computational costs and time for training large models.
- More robust and efficient optimization algorithms.
- Enhanced theoretical foundations for guiding deep learning practice.
