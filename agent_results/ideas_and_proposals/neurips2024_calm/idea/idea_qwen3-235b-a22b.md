**Title:** Causal Mediation Layers for Enhancing Robustness in Large Models  

**Motivation:** Large models often rely on spurious correlations due to their training on observational data, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts. While causal knowledge offers principled tools for robustness, integrating causal reasoning into pre-trained models remains challenging. Addressing this is critical for deploying reliable models in high-stakes domains like healthcare.  

**Main Idea:** We propose creating *Causal Mediation Layers* (CMLs) that identify and rewire non-causal pathways in large models during fine-tuning. First, we use causal mediation analysis on model sub-networks to pinpoint components amplifying spurious correlations. Then, we introduce intervention-aware layers that suppress or refine these components through a combination of counterfactual regularization (e.g., enforcing consistency under hypothetical interventions) and pruned causal graphs derived from domain knowledge. For example, in medical NLP, CMLs could isolate and rectify model reliance on biased linguistic patterns rather than actual clinical signals. Evaluation will focus on structured robustness tasks (e.g., WILDS, FEVER) and custom benchmarks mimicking real-world distribution shifts. We expect improved out-of-distribution accuracy and reduced sensitivity to confounding variables, alongside a framework for auditing model decisions through causal pathways. This approach bridges interpretable causality and scalability, enabling practical deployment of trustworthy models without retraining from scratch.
