**Title:** Causal Regularization for Robust Generalization in Large Language Models  

**Motivation:** Large models often fail under distribution shifts due to reliance on spurious correlations, limiting trust in safety-critical applications like healthcare. This work addresses (B) by leveraging causality to improve model robustness, ensuring reliable performance when training data is scarce or non-representative.  

**Main Idea:** Integrate causal structure learning with model training to penalize non-causal feature dependencies. First, use causal discovery methods (e.g., invariant prediction frameworks) to identify stable input-output relationships in pre-training data. Then, during fine-tuning, apply regularization to align model attention or gradients with these causal features. For example, in text generation, enforce attention to causal keywords (e.g., medical symptoms tied to diagnoses) while suppressing context-dependent distractors (e.g., stylistic phrases). The outcome would be models that generalize via causal mechanisms rather than surface correlations. Validation involves testing on synthetic benchmarks with known ground-truth causal graphs and real-world distribution shifts (e.g., cross-hospital medical notes). Impact: Improved interpretability, reduced brittleness, and certified robustness for high-stakes decisions.
