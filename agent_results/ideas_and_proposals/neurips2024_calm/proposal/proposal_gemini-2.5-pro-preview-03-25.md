## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** Counterfactually Guided Fine-tuning for Robust Large Language Models

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Large Language Models (LLMs), often termed foundation models, have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding and generation (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023). Trained on vast, largely unstructured datasets using self-supervised objectives, these models exhibit emergent abilities across diverse tasks, sometimes exceeding human performance (Bubeck et al., 2023). Their versatility has positioned them as potential core components in complex decision-making systems across various domains, including healthcare, finance, and policy-making.

However, the immense scale and complexity of LLMs lead to significant challenges concerning their trustworthiness and reliability (Bommasani et al., 2021). A primary concern is their tendency to learn and exploit spurious correlations present in the training data (Geirhos et al., 2020). These superficial patterns, while potentially boosting performance on in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, render the models brittle when faced with distribution shifts endemic to real-world environments. For instance, an LLM might erroneously associate specific names or demographic attributes with certain outcomes simply because such patterns were overrepresented in the training corpus, leading to biased or incorrect predictions when deployed (Jin et al., 2023; Kıcıman et al., 2023). This reliance on unstable correlations rather than underlying causal mechanisms undermines their robustness and fairness, hindering safe deployment in high-stakes applications.

The field of causality offers a principled framework for reasoning about "why" systems behave as they do and understanding how they respond to interventions (Pearl, 2009; Peters et al., 2017). By focusing on invariant causal relationships rather than volatile statistical associations, causal inference provides tools to build models that generalize better beyond the training distribution and whose behavior is more transparent and predictable. Recent works have begun exploring the intersection of causality and large models (Wu et al., 2024; Ma, 2024), investigating LLMs' inherent causal reasoning abilities (Jin et al., 2023; Kıcıman et al., 2023) and using causal principles to improve them (White & Black, 2024; Brown & Green, 2024). Specifically, counterfactual reasoning—considering "what if" scenarios—is a cornerstone of causal inference and holds promise for diagnosing and mitigating reliance on spurious correlations (Pearl, 2009). Counterfactual data augmentation and fine-tuning techniques have shown potential in smaller models and specific tasks (Doe & Smith, 2023; Johnson & Lee, 2023; Blue & Red, 2025).

Despite these advances, significant challenges remain. LLMs often struggle to distinguish correlation from causation (Jin et al., 2023). Generating meaningful and high-fidelity counterfactual data, especially for complex textual inputs, is non-trivial (Blue & Red, 2025). Furthermore, effectively integrating counterfactual guidance into the large-scale fine-tuning process without excessive computational overhead or compromising ID performance requires careful methodological design (Purple & Yellow, 2025).

**2.2 Research Objectives**
This research aims to address the challenge of LLM robustness by developing and evaluating a novel fine-tuning strategy guided by causal counterfactuals. Our primary goal is to steer LLMs towards relying on invariant causal features rather than spurious correlations, thereby enhancing their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and fairness.

The specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop a methodology for semi-automated generation of counterfactual text pairs:** Based on simplified, task-specific causal graphs that distinguish intended causal factors from known spurious correlates, we will devise a procedure to generate paired examples $(x_{factual}, x_{counterfactual})$. $x_{counterfactual}$ will represent a minimal intervention on the causal factor in $x_{factual}$ while holding the spurious correlate constant.
2.  **Implement a Counterfactually Guided Fine-tuning (CGFT) framework:** We will design a fine-tuning loss function that incorporates both standard task learning and a counterfactual consistency objective. This objective will encourage the LLM to produce predictions consistent with the expected outcome under the causal intervention represented by the counterfactual pair.
3.  **Empirically evaluate the effectiveness of CGFT:** We will rigorously test the proposed method on benchmark datasets known to exhibit spurious correlations. The evaluation will focus on:
    *   Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness: Assessing performance on test sets where spurious correlations are broken or shifted.
    *   In-distribution (ID) performance: Ensuring the method does not significantly degrade performance on standard test data.
    *   Fairness/Bias mitigation: Measuring the reduction in performance disparities across groups defined by sensitive attributes (spurious correlates).
4.  **Analyze the impact of CGFT:** Investigate how the proposed fine-tuning alters model behavior beyond aggregate metrics, potentially through analysis of attention mechanisms or probing internal representations (subject to feasibility).

**2.3 Significance**
This research directly addresses the critical need for more robust and trustworthy LLMs, a central challenge identified in the call for research on "Causality and Large Models" (specifically fitting under "Causality *for* large models"). By leveraging causal principles, specifically counterfactual reasoning, we aim to provide a practical methodology to mitigate the harmful effects of spurious correlations learned during pre-training or standard fine-tuning.

The potential impact is threefold:

*   **Scientific:** Contributes to the growing field at the intersection of causality and large models by providing a novel, causally-motivated fine-tuning technique. It offers insights into how causal concepts can be operationalized for large-scale deep learning models and may shed light on the mechanisms by which LLMs learn and represent information.
*   **Technological:** If successful, the CGFT framework could offer practitioners a valuable tool to enhance the reliability of deployed LLMs, particularly in domains sensitive to distribution shifts or fairness concerns (e.g., content moderation, medical diagnosis assistance, financial analysis).
*   **Societal:** By explicitly targeting and reducing reliance on spurious correlations often linked to societal biases (e.g., gender, race, socioeconomic status), this research contributes to the development of fairer and more equitable AI systems.

Addressing the challenges outlined in the literature review—identifying spurious correlations, generating high-quality counterfactuals, ensuring generalization, managing computational costs, and defining appropriate evaluation metrics—is integral to this proposal and achieving its objectives.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Conceptual Framework**
Our approach is grounded in the structural causal model (SCM) framework (Pearl, 2009), although applied pragmatically. We consider a prediction task where an LLM $M$ predicts an outcome $Y$ based on input text $X$. We hypothesize that $X$ contains features corresponding to a "true" causal variable $C$ (which *should* determine $Y$) and features corresponding to a "spurious" correlate $S$ (which *should not* determine $Y$, but might be statistically associated with $Y$ in the training data). The conventional LLM learns the observational conditional distribution $P(Y|X) = P(Y|C, S)$. Due to spurious correlations (e.g., confounding or selection bias in the data generating process), $S$ might be predictive of $Y$, leading the model to learn a shortcut reliance on $S$.

Our goal is to encourage the LLM to approximate the interventional distribution $P(Y|do(C=c))$, effectively learning the invariant mechanism $C \to Y$ while becoming invariant to $S$. We propose achieving this by fine-tuning with counterfactual pairs that simulate interventions. A counterfactual example $x_{cf}$ corresponding to a factual example $x_{fact}$ is constructed by changing the features related to $C$ (from $c$ to $c'$) while keeping features related to $S$ fixed ($s$). The model should then predict the outcome $y'$ corresponding to the intervention $do(C=c')$, regardless of the presence of $s$.

**3.2 Research Design**

**Step 1: Identification of Spurious Correlations and Causal Structures**
We will initially focus on text classification tasks where known spurious correlations are well-documented. Examples include:
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Spurious correlation between sentiment and specific names, locations, or demographic markers (e.g., reviews by certain user demographics being predominantly positive/negative in the training set).
    *   *Causal Graph (Simplified)*: $C$ (Sentiment-bearing phrases) $\to Y$ (Sentiment Label); $S$ (Author Name/Demographic) $\to Y$ (Spurious); potentially $S \leftrightarrow C$ (confounding). Goal: Learn $C \to Y$ mechanism.
*   **Natural Language Inference (NLI):** Hypothesis-only bias, where models predict entailment based on artifacts in the hypothesis statement alone, ignoring the premise.
    *   *Causal Graph (Simplified)*: $C$ (Premise-Hypothesis Relationship) $\to Y$ (Entailment Label); $S$ (Hypothesis Artifacts) $\to Y$ (Spurious). Goal: Learn $C \to Y$.
*   **Toxicity Detection:** Correlation between toxicity and mentions of certain identity groups.
    *   *Causal Graph (Simplified)*: $C$ (Toxic Language) $\to Y$ (Toxicity Label); $S$ (Identity Group Mention) $\to Y$ (Spurious, e.g., non-toxic discussion about an identity group flagged as toxic). Goal: Learn $C \to Y$.

We will rely on existing dataset analyses (e.g., Kaushik et al., 2019 for NLI; Dixon et al., 2018 for toxicity) and potentially manual annotation or probing techniques to identify specific instances of $C$ and $S$ within text examples.

**Step 3: Counterfactual Text Generation**
Given a factual example $x_{fact}$ with identified causal feature $c$ and spurious correlate $s$, generating the counterfactual $x_{cf}$ involves minimally editing $x_{fact}$ to change $c$ to $c'$ while preserving $s$. We propose a semi-automated approach:

1.  **Template-based Generation (for simpler cases):** For tasks with clear structures (e.g., sentiment in product reviews), define templates and swap relevant phrases.
    *   *Example (Sentiment):*
        *   $x_{fact}$: "Review by [Name=S]: The [Product] is [positive phrase=C]." ($Y$=Positive)
        *   $x_{cf}$: "Review by [Name=S]: The [Product] is [negative phrase=C']." ($Y'$=Negative)
        *   Here, $S$ ('Name') is held constant, $C$ ('positive phrase') is intervened upon.

2.  **LLM-based Generation (for complex cases):** Utilize a separate, powerful LLM (e.g., GPT-4) as a controlled "editor." We will prompt the generator LLM with $x_{fact}$, the identified $c$ and $s$, and the desired intervention $c \to c'$. The prompt will explicitly instruct the LLM to perform the minimal edit required for the intervention while keeping $s$ and other irrelevant parts of the text unchanged and maintaining fluency.
    *   *Example Prompt Structure:* "Given the factual sentence: '[x_fact]'. In this sentence, the causal feature C is '[c]' and the spurious correlate S is '[s]'. Generate a counterfactual sentence x_cf by changing C to '[c']' while keeping S exactly the same and making minimal other changes for grammatical correctness. The intended outcome Y' for x_cf is [target_label_y']."
    *   *Quality Control:* Generated examples will be filtered based on heuristics (e.g., edit distance, semantic similarity of non-intervened parts) and potentially human review for a subset to ensure fidelity to the intended intervention and linguistic quality.

This process yields pairs $(x_{fact}, y_{fact})$ and $(x_{cf}, y'_{cf})$, where $y'_{cf}$ is the target label under the counterfactual intervention based on the assumed causal graph (e.g., if sentiment words are flipped, the sentiment label should flip).

**Step 4: Counterfactually Guided Fine-tuning (CGFT)**

We will fine-tune a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama-3, BERT-large variants, depending on computational constraints and task requirements). The fine-tuning process involves a modified objective function:

Let $M$ be the LLM parameterized by $\theta$. Let $L_{CE}(x, y; \theta)$ be the standard cross-entropy loss for predicting label $y$ given input $x$. Our training batch will consist of both original examples $(x_i, y_i)$ and counterfactual pairs $(x_{fact, j}, y_{fact, j}), (x_{cf, j}, y'_{cf, j})$.

The total loss function $L_{total}$ will be:
$$ L_{total} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N L_{CE}(x_i, y_i; \theta) + \frac{\lambda}{J} \sum_{j=1}^J L_{CF}(x_{fact, j}, x_{cf, j}, y'_{cf, j}; \theta) $$

Where $N$ is the number of standard examples, $J$ is the number of counterfactual pairs in the batch, and $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter balancing the two loss components.

The counterfactual consistency loss $L_{CF}$ aims to ensure the model's prediction on $x_{cf}$ aligns with the target $y'_{cf}$. A straightforward implementation is:
$$ L_{CF}(x_{fact, j}, x_{cf, j}, y'_{cf, j}; \theta) = L_{CE}(x_{cf, j}, y'_{cf, j}; \theta) $$
This directly penalizes the model if its prediction for the counterfactual input $M(x_{cf, j})$ deviates from the expected counterfactual outcome $y'_{cf, j}$.

Alternative formulations for $L_{CF}$ could enforce relationships between the predictions on $x_{fact}$ and $x_{cf}$, for example, using KL divergence between output distributions if the intervention implies a specific probabilistic shift, or ensuring specific logit differences. We will start with the simpler $L_{CE}$ formulation on the counterfactual target.

The fine-tuning will proceed using standard optimization techniques (e.g., AdamW) for a fixed number of epochs or until convergence on a validation set. Hyperparameters ($\lambda$, learning rate, batch size) will be tuned.

**Step 5: Experimental Design and Evaluation**

*   **Datasets:**
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** BiosBias dataset (De-Arteaga et al., 2019) - correlating occupation with gender; subsets of Amazon reviews where specific user IDs might correlate with sentiment.
    *   **NLI:** SNLI/MNLI datasets (Bowman et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2018) using challenging subsets like HANS (McCoy et al., 2019) designed to detect heuristic usage.
    *   **Toxicity:** Jigsaw Unintended Bias dataset (Dixon et al., 2018), focusing on correlations between toxicity and identity group mentions. Civil Comments dataset.
    *   We will split data into ID train/validation/test and OOD test sets. OOD sets will be created by (a) using existing benchmarks (like HANS), (b) manually curating subsets where the spurious correlation is reversed or absent, or (c) subgroup analysis (e.g., performance on examples containing specific sensitive attributes $S$).

*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **Base LLM:** Zero-shot or few-shot performance of the pre-trained model without fine-tuning.
    2.  **Standard FT:** Fine-tuning the LLM only on the original training data ($L_{CE}$ only).
    3.  **Data Augmentation (DA):** Standard augmentation techniques suitable for text (e.g., back-translation, synonym replacement).
    4.  **Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA):** Method similar to Doe & Smith (2023), where counterfactual examples are added to the training data but potentially without the explicit consistency loss term $L_{CF}$.
    5.  **Robust Optimization Methods:** Techniques like Group DRO (Sagawa et al., 2019) if group labels (based on $S$) are available.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **ID Performance:** Accuracy, F1-score, AUC on the standard ID test set.
    *   **OOD Robustness:** Accuracy, F1-score, AUC on the OOD test sets. We will specifically report the performance gap (ID perf - OOD perf).
    *   **Fairness/Bias:** For tasks like toxicity detection or sentiment with demographic correlates, we will measure:
        *   Bias metrics: Difference in False Positive/Negative Rates (FPR/FNR) across groups defined by $S$.
        *   AUC difference between groups.
        *   Equality of Opportunity / Equalized Odds violations.
    *   **Calibration:** Expected Calibration Error (ECE) on both ID and OOD sets.

*   **Analysis:** We will perform ablation studies by varying the weight $\lambda$ of the counterfactual loss. We may also attempt qualitative analysis by examining model predictions on challenging examples and potentially using attention visualization or influence functions (if computationally feasible) to understand if the model shifts focus from spurious ($S$) to causal ($C$) features.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

*   **Expected Outcomes:**
    1.  **A validated CGFT methodology:** A clearly defined and empirically tested framework for fine-tuning LLMs using counterfactually generated text pairs.
    2.  **Improved OOD Robustness:** Quantitative evidence demonstrating that CGFT enhances LLM performance on OOD benchmarks compared to standard fine-tuning and other baseline methods across selected text classification tasks. We expect CGFT to reduce the performance drop between ID and OOD evaluations.
    3.  **Enhanced Fairness:** Demonstration that CGFT can mitigate known biases by reducing performance disparities across groups defined by spurious attributes, leading to fairer predictions.
    4.  **Characterization of Trade-offs:** An understanding of the potential trade-offs involved, such as the impact on ID performance, the computational cost of counterfactual generation and fine-tuning, and the sensitivity to the quality of generated counterfactuals and the accuracy of the underlying causal graph.
    5.  **Open-source Contributions (Potential):** Release of code implementing the CGFT framework and potentially generated counterfactual datasets for benchmark tasks to facilitate further research.

*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Advancing Trustworthy AI:** This research will contribute directly to making LLMs more reliable and robust, essential prerequisites for their deployment in critical real-world applications. By grounding the fine-tuning process in causal principles, we move beyond pattern matching towards models with a potentially deeper, more stable understanding.
    *   **Bridging Causality and Deep Learning:** This work serves as a concrete example of how theoretical concepts from causality can be translated into practical algorithms for large-scale machine learning models, fostering further synergy between these fields (as highlighted in the workshop call).
    *   **Practical Tools for Mitigation:** The CGFT framework could provide developers with a concrete strategy to proactively address known weaknesses related to spurious correlations in their LLMs, complementing other approaches like data curation and post-hoc bias correction.
    *   **Informing Future Research:** Findings regarding the effectiveness, limitations, and trade-offs of CGFT will inform future research directions in robust and causal representation learning, counterfactual generation, and the fundamental causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

By systematically developing and evaluating counterfactually guided fine-tuning, this research aims to make a significant contribution towards building more robust, reliable, and fair large language models.
