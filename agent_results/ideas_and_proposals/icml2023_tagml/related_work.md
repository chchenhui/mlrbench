**Key Challenges:**

1. **Capturing Complex Temporal Dependencies**: Effectively modeling the intricate temporal relationships in dynamic graphs remains challenging, as existing methods often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and evolving patterns.

2. **Scalability and Efficiency**: Dynamic graphs can grow rapidly, leading to scalability issues. Developing models that efficiently handle large-scale, evolving graphs without compromising performance is a significant challenge.

3. **Incorporating Geometric Structures**: Integrating differential geometry and Riemannian manifold theory into dynamic graph learning is complex, requiring specialized techniques to respect geometric constraints and capture the underlying structures governing graph evolution.

4. **Robustness to Missing Data**: Dynamic graphs often have incomplete or noisy data. Ensuring that models are robust to such imperfections and can still make accurate predictions is a critical challenge.

5. **Interpretability of Models**: As models become more complex, understanding and interpreting their decisions becomes harder. Developing methods that provide interpretable insights into the geometric nature of temporal graph evolution is essential for practical applications.
