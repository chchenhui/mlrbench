# Geometric Message Passing on Riemannian Manifolds for Dynamic Graph Representation Learning  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Dynamic graphs, where node attributes and topological connections evolve over time, are ubiquitous in applications such as traffic forecasting, epidemic modeling, and social network analysis. Existing approaches to dynamic graph learning, such as Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) and EvolveGCN, often model temporal dependencies through discrete snapshots or recurrent neural networks. However, these methods struggle to capture the *geometric structure* underlying graph dynamics—such as curvature, manifold-based interactions, and continuity in temporal evolution. Current literature highlights critical gaps: (1) poor handling of long-range dependencies due to Euclidean inductive biases, (2) inefficiency in learning invariant properties of structural evolution, and (3) lack of interpretability in learned representations.  

### Research Objectives  
This research proposes a novel framework that integrates *differential geometry* and *Riemannian manifold theory* into dynamic graph learning. The objectives are:  
1. **Geometric Representation**: Model dynamic graphs as trajectories on Riemannian manifolds to capture continuous evolution and geometric invariance.  
2. **Manifold-Aware Message Passing**: Design message passing neural networks (MPNNs) that operate on manifold tangent spaces using parallel transport, geodesic attention, and curvature-aware aggregation.  
3. **Interpretability & Robustness**: Provide theoretical guarantees and visualizations to explain how geometric properties influence dynamic graph evolution.  

### Significance  
By embedding dynamic graphs into Riemannian manifolds, this work addresses key limitations in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability. The framework’s ability to model complex geometric transformations will advance applications in traffic prediction (e.g., modeling road networks as curved manifolds) and biological systems (e.g., protein interaction dynamics). The integration of topology-aware operators (e.g., parallel transport) also bridges theoretical mathematics with machine learning, offering new tools for analyzing high-dimensional, non-Euclidean data.

## 2. Methodology  

### Research Design  
#### 2.1 Geometric Representation of Dynamic Graphs  
A dynamic graph $\mathcal{G}(t)$ is represented as a time-parameterized trajectory on a Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{M}$, where each graph snapshot $\mathcal{G}_t = (\mathcal{V}_t, \mathcal{E}_t)$ corresponds to a point on $\mathcal{M}$. Node features and edge connections are encoded via a map $f: \mathcal{G}_t \rightarrow \mathcal{M}$, preserving geometric relationships in latent space.  

**Mathematical Formulation**:  
Let $\mathbf{H}_t \in \mathcal{M}$ denote the graph embedding at time $t$. The temporal evolution is governed by a geodesic flow:  
$$
\mathbf{H}_{t+1} = \exp_{\mathbf{H}_t}\left(\mathbf{v}_t \cdot \Delta t \right),
$$  
where $\exp_{\mathbf{H}_t}(\cdot)$ is the exponential map at $\mathbf{H}_t$, and $\mathbf{v}_t \in T_{\mathbf{H}_t}\mathcal{M}$ is the velocity vector in the tangent space.  

#### 2.2 Manifold-Aware Message Passing  
The framework uses three geometric operators:  

**1. Parallel Transport for Temporal Consistency**  
Messages between nodes at time $t$ and $t+\Delta t$ are transported via the parallel transport operator $\Gamma_{t \rightarrow t+\Delta t}$ along the manifold’s Levi-Civita connection:  
$$
\mathbf{m}_{i \rightarrow j}^{(t)} = \Gamma_{t \rightarrow t+\Delta t}\left(\mathbf{h}_i^{(t)}\right) \cdot \mathbf{W}_m,
$$  
where $\mathbf{W}_m$ is a learnable weight matrix. This preserves inner products and avoids distortion during feature propagation.  

**2. Geodesic Attention Mechanism**  
Attention weights measure similarity *along geodesics* rather than in Euclidean space. For nodes $i$ and $j$:  
$$
\alpha_{ij} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{d_{\mathcal{M}}(\mathbf{h}_i, \mathbf{h}_j)}{\sqrt{d}}\right),
$$  
where $d_{\mathcal{M}}(\cdot)$ is the geodesic distance on $\mathcal{M}$, and $d$ is the feature dimension.  

**3. Curvature-Aware Aggregation**  
The Ricci curvature $\kappa_{ij}$ of the manifold at edge $(i,j)$ modulates message aggregation. The update rule for node $i$ is:  
$$
\mathbf{h}_i^{(t+1)} = \phi\left(\mathbf{h}_i^{(t)} + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} \kappa_{ij} \cdot \alpha_{ij} \mathbf{m}_{j \rightarrow i}^{(t)}\right),
$$  
where $\phi$ is a nonlinearity, and $\kappa_{ij}$ is estimated via the Ollivier-Ricci curvature approximation.  

#### 2.3 Experimental Design  
**Datasets**:  
- **Traffic Forecasting**: PeMS-Bay (road network traffic flow).  
- **Social Dynamics**: Reddit Hyperlink Graph (evolving user interactions).  
- **Physics Simulation**: N-Body Particle Trajectories (force-driven interactions).  

**Baselines**:  
- Temporal GNNs: TGAT, EvolveGCN, TGNs.  
- Continuous-Time: Neural CDEs, GN-CDE.  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
- **Accuracy**: MAE, RMSE (traffic), AUC-ROC (social link prediction).  
- **Efficiency**: Training time per epoch, GPU memory usage.  
- **Interpretability**: Curvature distribution analysis, attention pattern visualization.  

**Implementation**:  
- **Manifold Choice**: Hyperbolic (Poincaré ball) for hierarchical graphs; Spherical for cyclical dynamics.  
- **Optimization**: Riemannian Adam optimizer with geodesic gradient clipping.
