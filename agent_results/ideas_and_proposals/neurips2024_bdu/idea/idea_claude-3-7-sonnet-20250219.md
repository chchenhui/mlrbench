# Adaptive Bayesian Ensemble Selection for Reliable Decision-Making Under Uncertainty

## Motivation
Machine learning models often fail to quantify uncertainty properly, leading to unreliable decisions in critical applications. Traditional ensemble methods combine predictions but don't adaptively adjust to different uncertainty conditions or prioritize models based on their domain-specific reliability. This research addresses the need for decision-making systems that dynamically account for uncertainty in changing environments, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare diagnostics and autonomous systems where both accuracy and uncertainty quantification are crucial.

## Main Idea
I propose an adaptive Bayesian ensemble selection framework that dynamically weights and selects models based on their uncertainty characteristics in specific decision contexts. The approach maintains a probability distribution over ensemble configurations and updates this distribution as new data arrives or the environment changes. The system incorporates several key components: (1) a meta-learning module that learns uncertainty patterns across different problem domains, (2) a decision-theoretic utility function that balances confidence, diversity, and computational costs, and (3) a sequential Monte Carlo sampling method to efficiently explore the model space. This approach will automatically adjust the ensemble composition based on the detected uncertainty type (epistemic vs. aleatoric) and decision stakes, providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty estimates with performance guarantees while remaining computationally tractable for real-time applications. Expected outcomes include improved calibration in high-risk decisions and robust performance in out-of-distribution scenarios.
