**Title:** **LLM-Enhanced Bayesian Spatiotemporal Modeling for Adaptive Environmental Monitoring**  

**Motivation:** Spatiotemporal data (e.g., climate systems, disease outbreaks) demands accurate uncertainty quantification and scalability, which traditional Bayesian methods (e.g., Gaussian processes) struggle to balance in high-dimensional settings. Current models often fail to capture complex dependencies in dynamic environments, limiting their use in critical applications like climate risk mitigation or pandemic forecasting. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at encoding structured priors from vast knowledge but lack formal uncertainty quantification for robust spatiotemporal decision-making.  

**Main Idea:** This work proposes **GeoLlamaBayes**, an LLM-augmented hierarchical Bayesian framework combining symbolic knowledge from LLMs with scalable spatiotemporal inference. LLMs will generate physics-informed priors (e.g., fluid dynamics for air pollution dispersion) and structure Bayesian graphical models, while a lightweight neural stochastic process layer handles high-resolution data. A hybrid variational-inference pipeline with Laplace approximations and inducing-point Gaussian processes will enable real-time updates and uncertainty calibration. For instance, in airborne disease mapping, the system would use LLM-derived epidemiological rules to constrain Bayesian predictions while adapting to unseen environmental shifts via active learning. Experiments will focus on scalability benchmarks (e.g., 10x more sensor locations than baseline GP models) and decision-theoretic metrics like mistake bounds in sequential anomaly detection. Success would bridge LLMs' knowledge-enriched priors with Bayesian robustness, enabling high-fidelity adaptive sensing in environmental monitoring and beyond.
