**Large Language Model-Guided Prior Elicitation for Bayesian Optimization**

## **2. Introduction**  

### **Background**  
Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing black-box functions with minimal evaluations, critical for applications like hyperparameter tuning, material design, and drug discovery. BO relies on a surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), to balance exploration and exploitation via acquisition functions. However, BO’s efficiency hinges on the quality of the prior encoded in the GP. Informative priors—such as kernel choices, hyperparameter ranges, and input relevance—can accelerate convergence, while uninformative priors lead to suboptimal exploration, especially in high-dimensional or sparse-data regimes.  

Specifying priors requires domain expertise, which is often unavailable or impractical for complex problems. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a solution: LLMs can distill structured knowledge from natural language descriptions of tasks, enabling automated prior elicitation. For example, an LLM could parse a scientific paper describing a material synthesis process and extract constraints on temperature or pressure to inform a GP prior.  

### **Research Objectives**  
This work proposes to:  
1. Develop a framework to translate natural language descriptions of optimization tasks into GP priors using LLMs.  
2. Integrate LLM-derived priors into BO pipelines and evaluate their impact on convergence speed and solution quality.  
3. Validate the framework on synthetic benchmarks and real-world tasks (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, material design).  
4. Investigate methods to calibrate and refine LLM-generated priors for robustness.  

### **Significance**  
- **Scientific Discovery**: Accelerate expensive experiments (e.g., drug screening) by reducing function evaluations.  
- **Democratization**: Enable non-experts to deploy BO effectively in high-dimensional problems.  
- **LLM Utility**: Expand LLM applications beyond text generation to foundational roles in ML pipelines.  

### **Key Challenges**  
- Ensuring **accuracy** and **reliability** of LLM-generated priors.  
- **Interpretability**: Auditing how LLMs translate text into mathematical priors.  
- **Generalization**: Adapting the framework across domains (e.g., biology vs. engineering).

## **3. Methodology**  

### **3.1 Problem Formulation**  
Let $ f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ be a black-box function to optimize, where $ \mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^d $ is the input space. BO models $ f $ as a GP:  
$$
f(\mathbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(\mathbf{x}), k(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}')),
$$  
where $ m(\cdot) $ is the mean function and $ k(\cdot, \cdot) $ is a kernel. Prior elicitation involves specifying $ m, k $, and kernel hyperparameters $ \theta $.  

**Input**: A natural language description $ D $ of the task (e.g., "Optimize a neural network for CIFAR-10 with constraints on training time").  
**Output**: A GP prior $ \mathcal{P} = \{k, \theta, \mathcal{X}_{\text{relevant}}\} $, where $ \mathcal{X}_{\text{relevant}} \subseteq \mathcal{X} $ are relevant input dimensions.  

---

### **3.2 Prompting Strategy for Prior Elicitation**  
**Step 1: Structured Prompts**  
We design prompts to extract task-specific knowledge:  
- **Kernel Selection**: "What input features are most relevant for predicting the output?"  
- **Hyperparameter Ranges**: "What are typical ranges for learning rates and batch sizes in this context?"  
- **Constraints**: "Are there known physical or logical constraints on the input space?"  

**Step 2: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**  
To improve reliability, prompts include intermediate reasoning steps:  
1. Identify key variables (e.g., "Temperature affects reaction yield nonlinearly").  
2. Map variables to GP components (e.g., "Use a Matérn kernel for non-smooth relationships").  

**Step 3: Few-Shot Examples**  
Provide examples of prior elicitation tasks (e.g., hyperparameter tuning for CNNs) to guide the LLM.  

---

### **3.3 Parsing LLM Outputs into GP Priors**  
LLM responses are parsed into GP parameters:  
- **Kernel Type**: Translate qualitative descriptions (e.g., "smooth function") into kernels (e.g., RBF).  
- **Hyperparameters**: Extract ranges for lengthscales $ \ell_i $, signal variance $ \sigma_f^2 $, and noise variance $ \sigma_n^2 $.  
- **Input Relevance**: Prune irrelevant dimensions (e.g., "Ignore humidity in a vacuum experiment").  

**Example**:  
- LLM Output: "Learning rate and batch size are critical; use a kernel that handles scale differences."  
- Parsed Prior: Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) RBF kernel with $ \ell_{\text{learning rate}} \in [0.001, 0.1] $, $ \ell_{\text{batch size}} \in [32, 512] $.  

---

### **3.4 Integration with Bayesian Optimization**  
The LLM-derived prior initializes the GP. BO proceeds with standard acquisition functions (e.g., Expected Improvement, EI):  
$$
\alpha_{\text{EI}}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}\left[\max(f(\mathbf{x}) - f(\mathbf{x}^+), 0)\right],
$$  
where $ \mathbf{x}^+ $ is the best observation so far.  

**Refinement Loop**:  
1. After BO iterations, update the LLM with new observations to refine priors (optional).

## **5. Conclusion**  
This proposal addresses a critical bottleneck in Bayesian Optimization: the reliance on expert priors. By leveraging LLMs to automate prior elicitation, we aim to make BO more accessible, efficient, and impactful across scientific domains. Success will bridge the gap between human knowledge (encoded in text) and machine-driven optimization, advancing the deployment of AI in high-stakes applications. Future work includes extending to multi-objective BO and integrating uncertainty calibration into LLM prompts.
