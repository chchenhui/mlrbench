1. Title  
Emergent System-2 Reasoning via Self-Supervised Reflection Layers in Transformer Architectures  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Contemporary large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive proficiency in System-1 tasks—pattern recognition, statistical co-occurrence, and surface-level memorization. However, they fall short on System-2 reasoning: stepwise, rule-based problem solving, logical inference, and consistent decision making. This gap manifests in unreliable mathematical problem solving, contradictory answers, and brittleness when faced with procedurally novel inputs. While the “bitter lesson” of scale has driven remarkable gains in many domains, scaling alone has not yielded systematic improvements in multi-step reasoning or compositional generalization.  

Recent advances propose architectural and training augmentations to tackle these deficiencies. System 2 Attention (Weston & Sukhbaatar, 2023) regenerates context for better focus. Dualformer (Su et al., 2024) explicitly learns fast and slow reasoning modes. Curriculum strategies (Johnson & Williams, 2023) and contrastive frameworks (Chen & Lee, 2024) show promise in enforcing logical consistency. Meta-learning approaches (Brown & Green, 2023) also introduce internal mechanisms for reasoning refinement. Yet, none integrate an end-to-end, self-supervised scheme that both (a) encourages emergent reasoning capability within the model and (b) evaluates and corrects its own intermediate steps.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal presents a novel self-supervised framework—Reflection-Integrated Transformer (Refl-T)—designed to imbue transformer architectures with emergent System-2 reasoning. Our objectives are:  
• Architect an internal “Reflection Layer” that meta-evaluates the model’s intermediate reasoning steps and issues corrective feedback.  
• Develop a multi-stage training curriculum combining stepwise reasoning supervision, contrastive learning between correct and flawed traces, and reinforcement signals for logical consistency.  
• Create procedurally generated benchmarks to rigorously assess rule application, compositional generalization, and data-contamination resilience.  
• Demonstrate that Refl-T yields superior logical consistency and generalization relative to baselines (vanilla transformers, S2A, Dualformer).  

Significance  
Achieving emergent System-2 capabilities addresses critical barriers in AI safety, reliability, and trust. An LLM that can introspect and refine its reasoning is less prone to hallucinations, more robust to adversarial prompts, and better suited for high-stakes domains such as law, medicine, and scientific discovery. By embedding reasoning in the architecture rather than an external wrapper, Refl-T offers a scalable path to trustworthy AI.  

3. Methodology  
We structure our methodology into four components: data and benchmarks, model architecture with Reflection Layers, training objectives and procedures, and experimental design.  

3.1 Data and Benchmark Suite  
3.1.1 Procedural Task Generation  
We design a generator that yields reasoning problems of increasing complexity:  
– Arithmetic chains (e.g., “Compute (17 + 5) × (3 − 2) then add 4”).  
– Logical puzzles (e.g., syllogisms, knight-knave puzzles).  
– Algorithmic tasks (e.g., list sorting by specified rules).  
Each problem has a gold reasoning trace: a sequence of discrete steps paired with symbolic representations. We also generate negative traces by injecting controlled errors (swapping operands, violating a rule).  

3.1.2 Contamination Control  
To avoid overlap with pre-training corpora, we proceduralize task generation via randomized parameters and novel vocabulary tokens (e.g., “blorq,” “zint”). Training, validation, and test sets are strictly disjoint in parameter seeds.  

3.1.3 Benchmark Composition  
We adopt existing benchmarks—PrOntoQA, Big-Bench Hard—and augment them with our procedural suite. We report performance on:  
• In-distribution tasks (same parameter distributions as training).  
• Out-of-distribution tasks (higher reasoning depth, unseen rule combinations).  

3.2 Model Architecture: Reflection-Integrated Transformer (Refl-T)  
3.2.1 Base Transformer Backbone  
We start from a standard decoder-only transformer with $L$ layers, hidden size $d$, and $H$ attention heads. Each layer computes:  
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{SA}_\ell(X_\ell) &= \text{Softmax}\!\bigl(\tfrac{Q_\ell K_\ell^\top}{\sqrt{d/H}}\bigr)V_\ell,\\
X_{\ell+1} &= \mathrm{MLP}_\ell\bigl(\mathrm{LN}(X_\ell + \mathrm{SA}_\ell(X_\ell))\bigr) + X_\ell\,,
\end{aligned}
$$  
where $Q_\ell,K_\ell,V_\ell$ are the queries, keys, and values derived from $X_\ell$.  

3.2.2 Reflection Layers  
After every $M$ transformer layers, we insert a Reflection Layer that ingests the last $T$ step embeddings $S = \{s_{t-T+1},\dots,s_t\}$ and outputs a consistency score $c_t\in[0,1]$ and a correction vector $\delta_t$. Concretely:  
$$
h_t = \mathrm{Pool}\bigl(\{s_{i}\}_{i=t-T+1}^t\bigr),\quad
c_t = \sigma(W_c\,h_t + b_c),\quad
\delta_t = W_\delta\,h_t + b_\delta,
$$  
where Pool can be average-pooling or a small self-attention module. The Reflection output $(c_t,\delta_t)$ is fed back to adjust the next token logits. If $z_{t+1}$ are the pre-softmax logits from the transformer stack, we compute:  
$$
\tilde z_{t+1} = z_{t+1} + \alpha\,c_t\;\delta_t,
$$  
and $\mathrm{softmax}(\tilde z_{t+1})$ yields the next-token distribution. The scalar $\alpha$ controls the influence of reflection.  

3.3 Training Objectives and Procedures  
We define a composite loss:
$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{LM}} + \lambda_1\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}} + \lambda_2\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}} + \lambda_3\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}}.
$$  
3.3.1 Language Modeling Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{LM}}$)  
Standard cross-entropy on next-token prediction over reasoning traces.  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{LM}} = -\sum_{t=1}^T \log p(x_t\mid x_{<t},\theta).
$$  
3.3.2 Consistency Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}}$)  
Supervise the Reflection Layers to predict when contradictions occur. Given a binary label $y_t\in\{0,1\}$ (0 = consistent, 1 = flawed), we use BCE:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}} = -\sum_t\bigl[y_t\log c_t + (1-y_t)\log(1-c_t)\bigr].
$$  
3.3.3 Contrastive Reasoning Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}}$)  
We treat correct step representations $s_t^+$ and flawed $s_t^-$ as positive and negative pairs. Using InfoNCE with temperature $\tau$:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}} = -\sum_t \log\frac{\exp(\mathrm{sim}(s_t,s_t^+)/\tau)}{\exp(\mathrm{sim}(s_t,s_t^+)/\tau)+\exp(\mathrm{sim}(s_t,s_t^-)/\tau)},
$$  
where $\mathrm{sim}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is cosine similarity.  

3.3.4 Reinforcement-Style Reward ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}}$)  
We assign a small positive reward $r_t$ when a reasoning step obeys deducible rules (e.g., commutativity, transitivity). We apply the REINFORCE gradient with baseline:  
$$
\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}} = -\sum_t (r_t - b)\,\nabla_\theta\log p(x_t\mid x_{<t},\theta).
$$  

3.3.5 Curriculum Learning Schedule  
Tasks are partitioned into $K$ difficulty levels. We train in $K$ phases, gradually introducing deeper reasoning chains and richer rule sets. Transition from level $k$ to $k+1$ after validation performance on level $k$ exceeds threshold $\gamma$. This fosters progressive skill acquisition (Johnson & Williams, 2023).  

3.4 Experimental Design

• Chain-of-Thought prompting on a frozen LLM.  

3.4.2 Evaluation Metrics  
• Exact-match accuracy on final answers.  
• Stepwise logical consistency rate: fraction of steps flagged consistent by an oracle evaluator.  
• Generalization gap: difference between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance.  
• Reflection precision/recall: how accurately $c_t$ predicts true flaws.  
• Computational overhead: wall-clock time and parameter count.  

3.4.3 Ablation Studies  
We systematically remove or vary:  
• Reflection Layers (set $\alpha\!=\!0$).  
• Contrastive loss ($\lambda_2\!=\!0$).  
• RL reward ($\lambda_3\!=\!0$).  
• Curriculum schedule (train on all levels simultaneously).  

3.4.4 Implementation Details  
• Model size: 350 M parameters.  
• Training on 64 A100 GPUs for up to 100 B tokens.  
• Optimizer: AdamW with learning rate warmup and cosine decay.  
• Hyperparameter search for $\lambda_i$, $\alpha$, and $\tau$ via Bayesian optimization.  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Expected Outcomes  
We anticipate that Refl-T will:  
• Exhibit significantly higher logical consistency (≥ 20 pp improvement over baselines).  
• Reduce generalization gap on novel rule combinations by ≥ 15 pp.  
• Achieve reflection‐step precision/recall above 85 %.  
• Maintain computational efficiency within 10 % overhead of the base transformer.  

Impact  
By embedding self-critique and iterative refinement into the transformer, Refl-T advances the frontier of emergent reasoning in LLMs. Key impacts include:  
• Enhanced AI Safety: Models that detect and correct flawed reasoning are less prone to dangerous hallucinations.  
• Trustworthy Decision Making: Improved logical consistency fosters user confidence in AI-assisted analysis, legal reasoning, and scientific workflows.  
• Foundations for Hybrid Systems: The Reflection Layer concept may integrate naturally with symbolic modules, offering a unified neural-symbolic architecture.  
• Benchmarking Standards: Our contamination-controlled procedural suite and metrics provide a rigorous platform for future System-2 research.  

In summary, this proposal outlines a comprehensive, self-supervised approach to cultivate genuine System-2 reasoning within transformer models. By combining novel architectural modules, targeted losses, and a principled curriculum, we aim to close the gap between pattern recognition and stepwise logical inference, paving the way for more reliable and robust AI systems.
