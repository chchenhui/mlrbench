1. **Title**: RegulatoryGem: A Multi-Objective Optimization Framework for Harmonizing Conflicting Regulatory Requirements in ML  

2. **Motivation**: Regulatory policies often impose competing demands (e.g., fairness vs. privacy, explainability vs. performance), creating tension in ML system design. Practitioners lack clear tools to balance these multidimensional constraints systematically, leading to ad hoc compromises that may risk non-compliance or hinder deployment. Without principled methods to operationalize these trade-offs, the gap between regulatory intent and technical feasibility persists, delaying ethical AI adoption in high-stakes domains.  

3. **Main Idea**: RegulatoryGem proposes a model-agnostic, multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework that quantifies regulatory trade-offs using differentiable constraints. It reformulates fairness, privacy, explainability, and performance objectives as gradient-based objectives, enabling ML engineers to identify Pareto-optimal solutions via scalable algorithms. By incorporating regulatory weights defined by stakeholder priorities (e.g., GDPR vs. sector-specific guidelines), the framework generates models with *provable bounds* on compliance violations. A key innovation involves adversarial components to stress-test solutions against regulatory edge cases. Evaluation will use benchmark datasets (e.g., COMPAS, CelebA), with audits by legal experts to assess alignment with regulations like the EU AI Act. Expected outcomes include a Python library for compliance-aware ML, empirical insights into inherent trade-offs, and policy recommendations for harmonizing regulatory principles. This bridges the practice-theory gap, empowering developers to build systems that meet practical and legal standards without sacrificing utility.
