**Title:** "From Attack to Ally: Integrating Adversarial Feedback into Generative AI Training via Counterfactual Learning"  

**Motivation:** Red teaming identifies critical vulnerabilities in GenAI systems, but discovered risks often remain unmitigated until models are retrained. Current defenses are reactive, lacking systematic methods to transform adversarial examples into actionable training signals. This gap allows harmful behaviors to persist until vulnerabilities are addressed organically, risking misuse.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a framework named **CounterFactual Reinforcement from Adversarial Red Teaming (CF-RAT)**, which automatically converts adversarial prompts and model responses from red teaming exercises into **counterfactual training pairs** (e.g., “If the user had asked for X, the model should have replied with Y instead of Z”). These pairs would be used to fine-tune GenAI models via causal reinforcement learning, emphasizing interventions that prevent harmful outputs under adversarial conditions. Methodology includes: (1) clustering adversarial prompts to identify vulnerability patterns, (2) using human annotators or large-language-model-assisted tools to generate ideal responses, and (3) training a model to minimize divergence from the counterfactual responses while retaining general capabilities. Expected outcomes include models that proactively resist jailbreaking, reduce harmful content generation, and generalize better against novel adversarial strategies. This approach bridges red teaming and mitigation, creating a self-improving safety loop by repurposing adversaries as sources of structured training data, with potential impacts on accelerating trust in GenAI deployment.
