# **SecureED: Generative AI for Detecting and Preventing AI-Generated Responses in Educational Assessments**

---

## **1. Introduction**

### **Background**  
The proliferation of large foundation models (LFMs) such as GPT-4, Llama, and Gemini has revolutionized educational assessment by enabling automated scoring, item generation, and personalized learning. However, this progress has introduced critical challenges in maintaining academic integrity. Students increasingly misuse LFMs to generate responses for assignments, exams, and creative tasks, undermining the validity of assessments. Current detection tools, including GPTZero and Copyleaks, exhibit significant limitations: they struggle with cross-domain generalization, are vulnerable to adversarial evasion (e.g., paraphrasing), and often produce false positives/negatives, eroding trust among educators and students.  

The stakes are particularly high for high-stakes assessments requiring higher-order reasoning, such as coding challenges, mathematical proofs, or essay writing. Existing methods, such as watermarking (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023) or traditional ML classifiers (Najjar et al., 2025), fail to adapt to the multimodal and context-specific nature of educational responses. For instance, tools like ConDA (Bhattacharjee et al., 2023) and DeTeCtive (Guo et al., 2024) leverage contrastive learning for domain adaptation but focus on news or generic text, neglecting the unique linguistic patterns of student work.  

### **Research Objectives**  
This research proposes *SecureED*, a contrastive learning framework designed to:  
1. **Detect AI-generated responses** across multimodal educational tasks (text, code, math).  
2. **Generalize across domains** (e.g., STEM, humanities) and question types (e.g., open-ended, coding).  
3. **Resist adversarial evasion tactics** like paraphrasing and synonym substitution.  
4. **Ensure explainability** through interpretable features (e.g., reasoning coherence, creativity patterns).  

### **Significance**  
SecureED addresses a critical gap in AI-driven education: balancing innovation with accountability. By providing a robust, scalable detection system, this work will:  
- **Preserve assessment integrity** in the era of ubiquitous LFMs.  
- **Enable safe adoption** of generative AI for legitimate educational purposes (e.g., tutoring, feedback).  
- **Inform policy** on ethical AI use in academic settings.

## **2. Methodology**

### **2.1 Dataset Construction**  
A multimodal dataset of human- and AI-generated responses will be curated, covering diverse educational tasks:  
- **Text**: Essays, short-answer questions (e.g., history, literature).  
- **Code**: Programming solutions (Python, Java) for algorithmic problems.  
- **Math**: Step-by-step proofs and problem-solving in algebra/calculus.  

**Data Sources**:  
- Public datasets (e.g., CyberHumanAI (Najjar et al., 2025), TuringBench).  
- Partnerships with educational platforms (e.g., Coursera, edX) to collect anonymized student responses.  
- AI-generated responses using LFMs (GPT-4, Llama-3) with diverse prompts.  

**Labeling**: Human responses will be validated via plagiarism checks and instructor verification. AI-generated responses will be labeled by their source model.  

### **2.2 Model Architecture**  
SecureED employs a **contrastive learning framework** with three components:  
1. **Encoder Network**: A transformer-based model (e.g., RoBERTa-large) to embed responses into a shared latent space.  
2. **Contrastive Loss**: A triplet loss function to maximize the distance between human-AI response embeddings while minimizing intra-class variance:  
   $$
   \mathcal{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \max\left(0, \|f(x_i^h) - f(x_i^a)\|_2^2 - \|f(x_i^h) - f(x_j^h)\|_2^2 + \delta\right)
   $$  
   where $x_i^h$ and $x_i^a$ are human/AI responses to the same question, $f(\cdot)$ is the encoder, and $\delta$ is a margin hyperparameter.  
3. **Domain-Adversarial Training**: A gradient reversal layer (GRL) to learn domain-invariant features, improving generalization across subjects.  

### **2.3 Adversarial Training for Robustness**  
To counter evasion tactics (e.g., paraphrasing), SecureED will:  
- **Generate adversarial samples** using backtranslation (e.g., English→French→English) and synonym replacement (TextFooler (Jin et al., 2020)).  
- **Incorporate noise-aware training**: Augment the dataset with perturbed AI-generated responses during contrastive learning.  

### **2.4 Evaluation Metrics**  
**Primary Metrics**:  
- **Accuracy, F1-Score, AUC-ROC**: For binary classification (human vs. AI).  
- **Robustness**: Measured by performance degradation on adversarial samples.  
- **Generalizability**: Cross-domain accuracy (e.g., training on STEM, testing on humanities).  

**Baselines for Comparison**:  
- GPTZero (perplexity-based).  
- ConDA (domain adaptation).  
- XGBoost with handcrafted features (Najjar et al., 2025).  

**Experimental Design**:  
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold stratified splits to ensure balanced class distribution.  
- **Ablation Studies**: To assess contributions of contrastive loss, adversarial training, and domain adaptation.  

### **2.5 Integration with Educational Platforms**  
SecureED will be deployed as an API with:  
- **Real-time detection**: Embedding in LMS platforms (e.g., Moodle, Canvas) for instant feedback.  
- **Explainability Dashboard**: Visualizing key features (e.g., "burstiness," logical coherence) driving detection decisions.
