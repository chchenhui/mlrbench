# Permutation-Equivariant Contrastive Embeddings for Model Zoo Retrieval  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
The proliferation of publicly available neural network models—exceeding one million on platforms like Hugging Face—has transformed machine learning into a data-driven discipline where pre-trained models are a critical resource. However, the sheer scale of these "model zoos" poses a fundamental challenge: *How can practitioners efficiently discover models that are functionally relevant to new tasks?* Current retrieval systems rely on metadata (e.g., task labels, architecture descriptions), which fail to capture latent functional similarities encoded in the raw weights of neural networks. This limitation leads to redundant training, wasted computational resources, and suboptimal model reuse.  

Recent work has proposed treating neural network weights as a novel data modality, with properties such as permutation and scaling symmetries requiring specialized processing. While methods like graph neural networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning have been explored for weight space analysis, no unified framework exists to address the challenges of *symmetry-aware embedding* and *scalable retrieval* in large model zoos.  

### Research Objectives  
This research aims to develop a **permutation-equivariant contrastive learning framework** for embedding neural network weights into a structured space that respects layer-wise symmetries, enabling efficient model retrieval. Specific objectives include:  
1. Design a **symmetry-equivariant encoder** that maps weight tensors to embeddings invariant to neuron permutations and filter scalings.  
2. Implement a **contrastive learning pipeline** to train the encoder using symmetry-preserving augmentations and functionally dissimilar negative samples.  
3. Validate the framework’s ability to cluster models by task and architecture while enabling k-NN retrieval for unseen datasets.  
4. Establish evaluation metrics for retrieval precision, embedding coherence, and downstream fine-tuning efficiency.  

### Significance  
By addressing the gap between raw weight spaces and practical model retrieval, this work will:  
- **Reduce redundant training** by enabling precise identification of transferable pre-trained models.  
- **Democratize access to model zoos** through automated, functionality-driven search.  
- **Advance weight space learning** by unifying symmetry-aware architectures with contrastive objectives.  
- **Accelerate research** in model merging, neural architecture search, and meta-learning.

## 2. Methodology  

### Data Collection & Preprocessing  
**Source Datasets:**  
- **Model Zoo:** Curate a dataset of 10,000 pre-trained models from Hugging Face, spanning vision (ResNet, ViT), NLP (BERT, GPT-2), and graph neural networks. Each model is paired with metadata (task, architecture, training dataset).  
- **Downstream Tasks:** Select 10 benchmark datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, GLUE) to evaluate transfer learning performance.  

**Preprocessing:**  
1. **Weight Extraction:** Extract layer-wise weight matrices and biases for each model.  
2. **Symmetry-Preserving Augmentations:** Generate positive pairs via:  
   - *Neuron Permutations:* Randomly permute neurons within a layer.  
   - *Filter Scaling:* Apply scaling factors to convolutional filters or attention heads.  
3. **Negative Sampling:** Select models from distinct task categories (e.g., BERT for NLP vs. ResNet for vision) as negative pairs.  

### Permutation-Equivariant Encoder Architecture  
The encoder processes weight matrices as graphs where neurons are nodes and connections are edges. For a neural network with $L$ layers, the encoder operates as follows:  

**Graph Construction:**  
- For layer $l$ with weight matrix $W^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{in} \times d_{out}}$, construct a bipartite graph $G^{(l)}$ with:  
  - *Input neurons:* $N_{in} = \{n_1, ..., n_{d_{in}}\}$  
  - *Output neurons:* $N_{out} = \{m_1, ..., m_{d_{out}}\}$  
  - *Edges:* $e_{ij} = W^{(l)}_{ij}$ between $n_i$ and $m_j$.  

**Equivariant GNN Layers:**  
Each layer uses message passing with permutation-equivariant operations:  
1. **Message Function:** For edge $e_{ij}$, compute messages:  
   $$m_{ij} = \phi_m\left(h_i^{(k)}, h_j^{(k)}, e_{ij}\right),$$  
   where $h_i^{(k)}$ is the hidden state of node $i$ at layer $k$, and $\phi_m$ is an MLP.  
2. **Aggregation:** For each node $j$, aggregate messages:  
   $$m_j = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{N}(j)} m_{ij}.$$  
3. **Update Function:** Update node states:  
   $$h_j^{(k+1)} = \phi_u\left(h_j^{(k)}, m_j\right),$$  
   where $\phi_u$ is another MLP.  

**Hierarchical Pooling:**  
After processing all layers, apply permutation-invariant pooling (e.g., sum or mean) across nodes and layers to produce a fixed-size embedding $z \in \mathbb{R}^d$.  

### Contrastive Learning Framework  
**Loss Function:** Optimize the NT-Xent loss:  
$$\mathcal{L} = -\log \frac{\exp(z_i \cdot z_j / \tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^N \exp(z_i \cdot z_k / \tau)},$$  
where $(z_i, z_j)$ are positive pairs, $\tau$ is a temperature parameter, and $N$ includes all negatives in the batch.  

**Weak Supervision (Optional):** Incorporate downstream task performance (e.g., validation accuracy on a target dataset) as an auxiliary loss:  
$$\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{contrastive} + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{task}.$$  

### Experimental Design  
**Baselines:** Compare against:  
1. **Metadata-Based Retrieval:** TF-IDF or BERT embeddings of model descriptions.  
2. **Weight PCA:** PCA on flattened weight vectors.  
3. **Non-Equivariant GNNs:** Standard GNNs without symmetry handling.  

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
- **Retrieval Precision@K:** Percentage of top-K retrieved models that match the target task.  
- **Cluster Purity:** Coherence of embeddings via k-means clustering against task labels.  
- **Downstream Accuracy:** Fine-tuning performance of retrieved models on unseen datasets.  
- **Embedding Distance Correlation:** Spearman correlation between embedding distances and task performance differences.  

**Implementation Details:**  
- **Encoder:** 4-layer GNN with hidden dimension 256.  
- **Training:** Adam optimizer, learning rate $10^{-4}$, batch size 128, temperature $\tau=0.1$.  
- **Hardware:** 4x A100 GPUs, training time ~48 hours.
