# Permutation-Equivariant Contrastive Embeddings for Neural Network Weight Space Navigation

## Introduction

The explosive growth of publicly available pre-trained neural networks—now exceeding a million models on platforms like Hugging Face—has created both unprecedented opportunities and challenges for the machine learning community. This abundance of models represents a vast repository of learned knowledge, potentially accelerating progress across domains by enabling transfer learning and reducing redundant computation. However, the current paradigm for discovering suitable pre-trained models relies heavily on metadata-based search, which fails to capture the functional similarities encoded within model weights themselves. This limitation leads practitioners to frequently reinvent the wheel by training new models when suitable pre-trained alternatives might already exist but remain undiscovered.

Neural network weights represent a rich, yet underexplored data modality. Unlike conventional data types such as images or text, network weights encode complex functional relationships and inductive biases learned from data. The weight space exhibits unique properties, including multiple symmetries (e.g., permutation equivalence, scaling invariance) that complicate direct comparison between models. Despite these challenges, the weight space holds valuable information about a model's capabilities, generalization properties, and potential transferability to new tasks.

This research introduces a novel framework to learn compact, functionally meaningful embeddings of neural network weights that respect their inherent symmetries. By casting weight matrices as graph structures and employing permutation-equivariant neural architectures, we develop representations that capture the essential functional characteristics of models while being invariant to meaningless transformations. Our approach uses contrastive learning to map models with similar functional properties close together in the embedding space, regardless of superficial differences in their parameterization.

The primary objectives of this research are to:

1. Develop permutation-equivariant encoders that map neural network weights to a lower-dimensional embedding space while preserving functional similarities and respecting weight-space symmetries.

2. Design an effective contrastive learning framework for training these encoders using carefully constructed positive and negative pairs.

3. Evaluate the quality of the learned embeddings for model retrieval tasks, measuring their ability to identify functionally similar models for transfer learning.

4. Investigate the emergent structure of the embedding space to understand how it organizes models based on their architectural properties and capabilities.

The significance of this work extends beyond mere convenience in model discovery. By developing methods to effectively navigate the weight space of neural networks, we lay the groundwork for more efficient transfer learning protocols, automated model selection systems, and even generative approaches to neural architecture search. Furthermore, this research contributes to the broader effort of establishing neural network weights as a first-class data modality for machine learning research, connecting disparate areas such as meta-learning, model merging, and neural architecture search under a unified conceptual framework.

## Methodology

### Overview

Our methodology comprises three main components: (1) a permutation-equivariant encoder architecture for mapping neural network weights to embeddings, (2) a contrastive learning framework for training these encoders, and (3) a comprehensive evaluation protocol to assess the quality of the learned embeddings for model retrieval and transfer learning tasks.

### Permutation-Equivariant Encoder Architecture

Neural networks exhibit symmetries that complicate direct comparison of weights. Most notably, permuting neurons within a layer (and correspondingly adjusting connections to maintain functionality) produces a network with identical behavior but different weight values. To address this challenge, we design an encoder that is equivariant to such permutations.

#### Weight Graph Construction

We represent each neural network as a collection of weight matrices $\{W_l\}_{l=1}^L$, where $W_l \in \mathbb{R}^{n_l \times n_{l-1}}$ for fully-connected layers. For each weight matrix, we construct a bipartite graph $G_l = (V_l, E_l)$ where:
- $V_l = V_l^{in} \cup V_l^{out}$ represents the input and output neurons
- $E_l = \{(i, j, w_{ij}) | i \in V_l^{in}, j \in V_l^{out}, w_{ij} \in W_l\}$ represents the weighted connections

For convolutional layers, we adapt this representation to account for their specific structure, mapping kernels to graph nodes with appropriate connectivity patterns.

#### Layer-wise Processing

For each layer graph $G_l$, we employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with the following message-passing scheme:

$$h_i^{(k+1)} = \phi \left( h_i^{(k)}, \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \psi(h_i^{(k)}, h_j^{(k)}, e_{ij}) \right)$$

where:
- $h_i^{(k)}$ is the feature vector of node $i$ at iteration $k$
- $\mathcal{N}(i)$ is the set of neighbors of node $i$
- $e_{ij}$ is the weight of the connection between nodes $i$ and $j$
- $\phi$ and $\psi$ are learnable neural network functions

Initial node features $h_i^{(0)}$ encode the layer position (normalized depth) and basic neuron properties (bias values, activation function types).

After $K$ message-passing iterations, we aggregate the node features to obtain a layer embedding:

$$z_l = \rho(\{h_i^{(K)} | i \in V_l\})$$

where $\rho$ is a permutation-invariant aggregation function, such as sum or mean.

#### Cross-layer Integration

To capture dependencies between layers, we process the sequence of layer embeddings $\{z_l\}_{l=1}^L$ using a Transformer encoder with position encodings corresponding to normalized layer depths:

$$\tilde{z}_1, \tilde{z}_2, ..., \tilde{z}_L = \text{TransformerEncoder}(z_1 + p_1, z_2 + p_2, ..., z_L + p_L)$$

where $p_l$ represents the positional encoding for layer $l$.

The final model embedding is computed as:

$$z_\text{model} = \text{MLP}(\text{PoolingFunction}(\tilde{z}_1, \tilde{z}_2, ..., \tilde{z}_L))$$

where the pooling function could be mean pooling, attention-weighted pooling, or concatenation followed by projection.

### Contrastive Learning Framework

We train our encoder using a contrastive learning approach, which requires defining positive and negative pairs of examples.

#### Positive Pair Generation

Positive pairs are generated by applying symmetry-preserving transformations to model weights:

1. **Neuron Permutation**: Randomly permute neurons within layers and adjust connecting weights accordingly:
   $$W_l' = P_l W_l P_{l-1}^T$$
   where $P_l$ and $P_{l-1}$ are permutation matrices.

2. **Weight Scaling**: Apply balanced scaling transformations:
   $$W_l' = \alpha_l W_l \alpha_{l-1}^{-1}$$
   where $\alpha_l > 0$ are scaling factors.

3. **Pruning and Retraining**: Prune a percentage of weights and fine-tune the model to restore performance, creating functionally similar models with different weight distributions.

4. **Architecture-Preserving Distillation**: Train a model with identical architecture on data generated by the original model.

#### Negative Pair Selection

Negative pairs are formed by selecting models that are functionally distinct:

1. Models trained on different datasets or tasks
2. Models with different architectural families (e.g., CNNs vs. Transformers)
3. Models with significantly different performance metrics on benchmark tasks

#### Loss Function

We employ the InfoNCE loss for contrastive learning:

$$\mathcal{L}_\text{InfoNCE} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_i^+) / \tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_i^+) / \tau) + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_j) / \tau)}$$

where:
- $z_i$ and $z_i^+$ are embeddings of a positive pair
- $\mathcal{N}(i)$ is the set of negative examples
- $\text{sim}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity)
- $\tau$ is a temperature parameter

To incorporate weak supervision from performance metrics when available, we add an auxiliary loss term:

$$\mathcal{L}_\text{aux} = \text{MSE}(f(z_i), m_i)$$

where $f$ is a small MLP that predicts performance metrics $m_i$ from embeddings $z_i$.

The total loss is a weighted combination:

$$\mathcal{L}_\text{total} = \mathcal{L}_\text{InfoNCE} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_\text{aux}$$

### Data Collection and Processing

Our training data consists of:

1. **Model Repositories**: We will curate a diverse collection of pre-trained models from Hugging Face, PyTorch Hub, and TensorFlow Hub, covering various architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) and applications (computer vision, NLP, audio processing).

2. **Architectural Families**: For each architecture family, we will include models of varying sizes, training hyperparameters, and performance levels.

3. **Known Transfer Relationships**: We will incorporate models with established transfer learning relationships (e.g., models fine-tuned from common pre-trained backbones).

For each model, we extract and normalize weight matrices, handling architecture-specific components such as batch normalization parameters, residual connections, and attention mechanisms.

### Experimental Design

#### Model Zoo Retrieval Evaluation

We will assess the quality of our learned embeddings through a series of retrieval experiments:

1. **k-Nearest Neighbor Retrieval**: For each query model, we retrieve the k most similar models according to embedding distance and evaluate:
   - Transfer learning performance: How well do retrieved models fine-tune to the query model's task?
   - Task similarity: Do retrieved models perform related tasks to the query model?
   - Architectural similarity: Do retrieved models share architectural features with the query model?

2. **Zero-Shot Task Prediction**: We will evaluate the embeddings' ability to predict a model's suitability for unseen tasks without fine-tuning, measuring:
   - Task accuracy prediction: Can embedding distance predict performance on new tasks?
   - Training efficiency prediction: Can embeddings identify models requiring minimal fine-tuning?

#### Embedding Space Analysis

To understand the structure of the learned embedding space:

1. **Dimensionality Reduction Visualization**: Apply t-SNE or UMAP to visualize the embedding space, analyzing clustering by architecture, task domain, and performance.

2. **Interpolation Studies**: Investigate whether linear interpolation in the embedding space corresponds to meaningful functional interpolation between models.

3. **Ablation Studies**: Evaluate the importance of different components of our approach by removing or modifying:
   - Specific symmetry-preserving transformations
   - Cross-layer integration mechanisms
   - Various positive pair generation strategies

#### Transfer Learning Efficiency

We will measure how our embeddings can accelerate transfer learning:

1. **Retrieval-Based Model Selection**: Compare fine-tuning performance when using our embedding-based retrieval versus standard metadata-based selection.

2. **Few-Shot Learning Performance**: Evaluate few-shot adaptation of retrieved models compared to randomly selected models of similar size.

3. **Compute Efficiency**: Measure total computation saved by using our retrieval system to identify optimal pre-trained models versus training from scratch.

### Evaluation Metrics

To comprehensively evaluate our approach, we will use the following metrics:

1. **Retrieval Precision@k**: Percentage of top-k retrieved models that are functionally similar to the query.

2. **Transfer Learning Efficiency**: Ratio of fine-tuning steps needed for a randomly selected model versus a retrieved model to reach target performance.

3. **Embedding Space Clustering Quality**: Measured by normalized mutual information between embedding clusters and known model categories.

4. **Task Performance Correlation**: Correlation between embedding distance and difference in task performance.

5. **Invariance to Symmetries**: How consistent are embeddings for functionally equivalent models with different parameterizations?
