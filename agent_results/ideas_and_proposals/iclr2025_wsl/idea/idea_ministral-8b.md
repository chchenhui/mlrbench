### Title: "Symmetry-Aware Weight Space Learning for Enhanced Neural Network Performance"

### Motivation:
Neural network weights are traditionally viewed as internal parameters, but they possess inherent symmetries and properties that can be leveraged to improve learning efficiency and model performance. By understanding and exploiting these properties, we can develop more robust and efficient neural network models. This research aims to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the weight space, focusing on symmetry-aware learning paradigms to enhance neural network performance.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research involves developing symmetry-aware weight space learning techniques that can improve the expressiveness, generalization, and efficiency of neural networks. The key steps include:

1. **Characterization of Weight Symmetries**: Identify and characterize the symmetries present in neural network weights, such as permutations, scaling, and other transformations. This will involve developing theoretical frameworks and computational methods to analyze and quantify these symmetries.

2. **Symmetry-Aware Weight Space Augmentation**: Design augmentation techniques that preserve and exploit the symmetries in the weight space. This includes scaling laws, model zoo datasets, and other methods to enhance the robustness and generalization of neural networks.

3. **Symmetry-Aware Learning Paradigms**: Develop supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms that incorporate symmetry-aware techniques. This includes meta-learning networks, hyper-networks, autoencoders, and other architectures that can leverage the symmetries in the weight space for improved learning.

4. **Theoretical Foundations**: Establish theoretical foundations for weight space learning, including the expressivity of symmetry-aware processing modules and the generalization bounds of these techniques. This will involve rigorous mathematical analysis and experimental validation.

5. **Applications**: Explore the applications of symmetry-aware weight space learning in various domains, such as computer vision tasks (using NeRFs/INRs), physics, dynamical system modeling, backdoor detection, and adversarial robustness. This will involve developing practical tools and frameworks that can be used by researchers and practitioners.

By focusing on symmetry-aware weight space learning, this research aims to drive significant advancements in neural network performance and efficiency, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and democratizing the usage of weight spaces in various fields.
