## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **Dynamic Human-AI Co-Adaptation Loops for Personalized and Real-Time Code Assistance**

**2. Introduction**

**Background:**
The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized software development, with AI-powered code assistants like GitHub Copilot demonstrating remarkable capabilities in code generation, completion, and explanation (Chen et al., 2021; OpenAI Codex). These tools promise significant productivity gains by automating repetitive tasks and assisting developers in complex problem-solving. However, current assistants often operate under a "one-size-fits-all" paradigm. They lack the ability to dynamically adapt to individual developers' unique coding styles, preferences, project contexts, cognitive states, and evolving needs over time. This mismatch can lead to suboptimal suggestions, increased cognitive load for filtering irrelevant outputs, friction in the human-AI interaction, and ultimately limit the potential productivity and collaborative benefits (Kazemitabaar et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2025).

While research exists on personalizing AI systems, including code generators (Dai et al., 2024; Hou et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024), and on proactive assistance (Zhao et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2024), most approaches focus on static personalization based on historical data or limited feedback modalities. The concept of a continuous, reciprocal adaptation loop, where both the human developer and the AI assistant learn from each other in real-time through rich, situated feedback, remains largely unexplored in the context of code generation. This gap is significant because software development is a dynamic and iterative process, requiring tools that can evolve alongside the developer and the project. The recent focus on human-AI collaboration (Holter & El-Assady, 2024; Gao et al., 2023) and agentic capabilities in AI (DL4C Workshop Call) highlights the need for more deeply integrated and adaptive systems. Addressing the challenge of real-time, user-specific adaptation is crucial for unlocking the next level of human-AI synergy in programming.

**Research Objectives:**
This research aims to design, implement, and evaluate a novel framework for **Human-AI Co-Adaptation Loops** in the context of AI-powered code assistants. The central hypothesis is that enabling continuous, bidirectional adaptation between the developer and the AI assistant, facilitated by rich, in-situ feedback and online learning, will lead to more effective, efficient, and satisfying programming experiences.

Our specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Framework for Human-AI Co-Adaptation in Code Assistants:** Conceptualize and define the components and interactions within a co-adaptive loop, emphasizing real-time feedback, user control, and model personalization.
2.  **Design and Implement Multi-Modal In-Situ Feedback Mechanisms:** Create lightweight mechanisms, integrated within popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), to capture diverse forms of implicit (e.g., code edits following suggestions, acceptance/rejection patterns, timing data) and explicit (e.g., quick ratings, targeted corrections via voice or text, preference settings) user feedback during coding sessions.
3.  **Develop Efficient Algorithms for Real-Time Model Adaptation:** Investigate and implement online and meta-learning algorithms capable of rapidly updating the underlying code generation model's behavior based on the streaming influx of user feedback, ensuring responsiveness without compromising core capabilities or incurring prohibitive computational costs.
4.  **Evaluate the Impact of Co-Adaptation on Developer Productivity, Code Quality, and User Experience:** Conduct rigorous empirical studies (both controlled experiments and potentially real-world deployments) to quantify the effects of the proposed co-adaptive system compared to baseline non-adaptive assistants. Assess metrics related to task completion speed, code correctness, interaction efficiency, perceived alignment, usability, and overall satisfaction.
5.  **Investigate Responsible AI Considerations:** Explore and incorporate principles of transparency, user control, and privacy-preservation within the co-adaptive framework, ensuring developers understand and can influence the adaptation process while safeguarding their data.

**Significance:**
This research addresses critical challenges identified in the DL4C workshop call, particularly concerning **Developer Productivity and HCI for Code**, **Post-training and Alignment for Code**, and **Responsible AI for Code**. By focusing on dynamic personalization through co-adaptation, this work has the potential to:

*   **Enhance Developer Productivity:** Move beyond generic suggestions to provide contextually relevant, stylistically aligned, and personalized assistance, reducing manual effort and accelerating development cycles.
*   **Improve Human-AI Collaboration:** Foster a more synergistic relationship where the AI acts as a tailored partner rather than a generic tool, adapting to the user's flow and intent. This aligns with investigations into effective Human-AI interaction (Holter & El-Assady, 2024; Guan et al., 2023).
*   **Advance Machine Learning Techniques for Code:** Contribute novel online and meta-learning strategies specifically tailored for the domain of code generation and real-time user adaptation, addressing challenges of data sparsity and efficient updates for large models.
*   **Inform the Design of Future AI Assistants:** Provide empirically validated design principles and interaction patterns for creating adaptive, user-centric AI tools, not just for code but potentially for other complex creative and analytical domains.
*   **Promote Responsible AI Development:** Offer insights and practical approaches for building adaptive systems that respect user agency, privacy, and provide transparency into the learning process, contributing to the discourse on responsible AI and open science practices.

**3. Methodology**

**Overall Research Design:**
This research will follow a mixed-methods approach, combining system design and development with rigorous empirical evaluation. The core methodology revolves around building and testing a prototype system embodying the human-AI co-adaptation loop.

**3.1. Framework Definition:**
We will formalize the concept of the "Human-AI Co-Adaptation Loop" (see Figure 1 - conceptual). This involves characterizing the states, actions, and learning processes of both the human developer and the AI assistant within their interaction cycle.

*(Conceptual Figure 1: User interacts with IDE -> AI Assistant suggests code -> User provides feedback (Implicit: edit, accept, ignore; Explicit: rating, correction, preference setting) -> AI Model adapts based on feedback -> AI Assistant provides improved suggestions -> Loop continues)*

**3.2. Data Collection: Multi-Modal In-Situ Feedback Engine:**
We will develop an IDE plugin (initially targeting Visual Studio Code due to its extensibility and popularity) to capture rich user feedback unobtrusively during natural coding workflows.

*   **Implicit Feedback:**
    *   **Suggestion Acceptance/Rejection:** Logging whether a suggestion is accepted (partially or fully) or ignored.
    *   **Post-Suggestion Edits:** Capturing the edit distance (e.g., Levenshtein distance) and semantic similarity between the AI's suggestion and the developer's final code. Significant edits imply disagreement or necessary refinement.
    *   **Timing Data:** Measuring time taken to accept/reject/edit a suggestion, potentially indicating cognitive load or suggestion quality.
    *   **Cursor/Focus Tracking:** Analyzing interaction patterns around suggestions.
*   **Explicit Feedback:**
    *   **Simple Ratings:** UI elements (e.g., thumbs up/down, star rating) displayed unobtrusively alongside suggestions.
    *   **Targeted Corrections:** Allowing users to quickly provide the "correct" code snippet or a natural language instruction (potentially via voice command, e.g., "Change this loop to use list comprehension") to guide the model.
    *   **Preference Controls:** UI elements allowing users to explicitly set preferences regarding coding style (e.g., variable naming conventions, commenting frequency, functional vs. object-oriented bias), verbosity of explanations, or types of suggestions desired.
*   **Contextual Data:** Capturing surrounding code, project structure (if available and permitted), programming language, and task description (e.g., comments, issue tracker text) to contextualize the feedback.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** All data collection will be opt-in, with clear consent procedures. Data will be anonymized where possible. We will prioritize local processing for adaptation to minimize data transmission, exploring techniques like federated learning or on-device fine-tuning if feasible. Users will have controls to pause, reset, or inspect the adaptation process.

**3.3. Algorithmic Approach: Real-Time Adaptation using Online and Meta-Learning:**
The core technical challenge lies in enabling rapid adaptation of a large code LLM based on sparse, noisy, and diverse feedback streams from individual users.

*   **Base Model:** We will start with a powerful open-source pre-trained code LLM (e.g., CodeLlama, StarCoder, or similar available models) as our foundation ($M_{base}$).
*   **Personalization Architecture:** To enable efficient user-specific adaptation without retraining the entire model, we will explore parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. This might involve:
    *   **Adapters:** Inserting small, trainable feed-forward layers within the transformer architecture (Houlsby et al., 2019).
    *   **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA):** Injecting trainable low-rank matrices into specific layers (Hu et al., 2021).
    *   **Prefix/Prompt Tuning:** Learning continuous prompt embeddings prepended to the input (Li & Liang, 2021).
    Each user $u$ will have their own small set of personalized parameters $\theta_u$, such that the personalized model output is $M(x; \theta_{base}, \theta_u)$, where $\theta_{base}$ are the frozen base model parameters.
*   **Online Learning Module:** This module updates $\theta_u$ based on the incoming feedback stream $F_t = \{(x_i, y_i, f_i)\}_t$.
    *   **Feedback Integration:** Different feedback types will inform different loss signals.
        *   *Acceptance/Edits:* Treat accepted suggestions (potentially after minor edits) as positive examples and heavily edited/rejected suggestions as negative examples. We can use a cross-entropy loss for generation or a contrastive loss to push the model towards preferred outputs and away from undesired ones. Let $y_{sug}$ be the suggested code and $y_{final}$ be the user's final code. A potential loss term could minimize the distance $D(M(x; \theta_{base}, \theta_u), y_{final})$ for accepted/edited suggestions, possibly weighted by the degree of acceptance/edit.
        *   *Ratings:* Use explicit ratings (e.g., thumbs up/down) as rewards in a Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)-like framework (Ouyang et al., 2022), simplified for online updates. We can train a lightweight reward model or directly use the ratings to adjust gradients. For instance, a simple update rule could be:
            $$\theta_u^{t+1} = \theta_u^t + \eta R(f_i) \nabla_{\theta_u} \log P(y_i | x_i; \theta_{base}, \theta_u^t)$$
            where $R(f_i)$ is a scalar reward derived from feedback $f_i$ (e.g., +1 for thumbs up, -1 for thumbs down) and $\eta$ is the learning rate.
        *   *Corrections:* Treat explicit corrections $y_{corr}$ provided by the user as high-quality positive examples, potentially with a higher weight in the loss function:
            $$L_{corr} = - \log P(y_{corr} | x_i; \theta_{base}, \theta_u)$$
        *   *Preference Settings:* These might directly gate specific model behaviors or steer generation via conditional prompting, rather than direct gradient updates.
    *   **Update Strategy:** Updates will be performed frequently but efficiently (e.g., after each relevant interaction or batched over short time windows) using optimizers suitable for online settings (e.g., Adam, Adagrad). We will explore techniques to prevent catastrophic forgetting of the base model's capabilities.
*   **Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation:** To accelerate adaptation for new users or when user preferences shift significantly, we will investigate meta-learning approaches (Finn et al., 2017). The goal is to train the base model $M_{base}$ or the initialization of personalized parameters $\theta_u$ such that they can be rapidly adapted to a new user's style with very few feedback examples. This involves a bi-level optimization process, typically performed offline using data from multiple users:
    $$\min_{\theta_{base}, \phi_{init}} \sum_{u} L_{meta}(\theta_u^*)$$
    where $\theta_u^*$ are the parameters obtained after applying $k$ online update steps on user $u$'s data, starting from an initial state determined by $\theta_{base}$ and initial personalization parameters $\phi_{init}$. $L_{meta}$ is the loss evaluated on a held-out set of user $u$'s data.

**3.4. System Implementation:**
*   **IDE Plugin:** Frontend using TypeScript/JavaScript for VS Code API integration. Responsible for capturing interactions, displaying suggestions, managing feedback UI.
*   **Backend Service:** Python-based backend (potentially using FastAPI or Flask) hosting the personalized LLM. Manages model inference, online updates, and user parameter storage. Communication via LSP (Language Server Protocol) or custom API.
*   **Model Serving:** Employ efficient inference frameworks (e.g., Hugging Face TGI, vLLM) capable of handling PEFT techniques and potentially batched inference if multiple users are served (though initial focus is single-user adaptation). Local inference will be explored for privacy enhancement.

**3.5. Experimental Design and Evaluation:**
We will conduct a controlled user study to evaluate the co-adaptive system.

*   **Participants:** Recruit N (aiming for N=24-30) software developers with varying levels of experience (e.g., junior, mid-level, senior) and familiarity with AI code assistants.
*   **Tasks:** Design a set of realistic programming tasks, representative of common development activities (e.g., implementing a specified function, debugging faulty code, refactoring existing code, writing unit tests) in a common language (e.g., Python or JavaScript). Tasks should allow for stylistic variation and require multiple interactions with the assistant.
*   **Conditions:** We will use a within-subjects design (each participant experiences all conditions to control for individual differences, counterbalancing order to mitigate learning effects) or a between-subjects design (if learning effects between adaptive and non-adaptive states are too strong).
    *   **Condition A (Baseline):** Participant uses the IDE with a standard, non-adaptive code assistant (based on $M_{base}$ without personalization).
    *   **Condition B (Co-Adaptive):** Participant uses the IDE with the co-adaptive assistant ($M(x; \theta_{base}, \theta_u)$) enabled, allowing for real-time feedback and adaptation.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Pre-study questionnaire (demographics, experience).
    2.  Tutorial on using the assigned assistant.
    3.  Participants perform the coding tasks under the assigned condition(s). We will use think-aloud protocol, screen recording, and interaction logging.
    4.  Post-task questionnaires and/or semi-structured interviews to gather qualitative feedback on usability, perceived alignment, trust, and satisfaction.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Performance & Productivity:**
        *   *Task Completion Time:* Total time taken to successfully complete each task.
        *   *Code Correctness:* Functional correctness assessed using predefined unit tests (e.g., Pass@1).
        *   *Interaction Efficiency:* Number of suggestions generated, acceptance rate, average edit distance for accepted suggestions, number of explicit feedback interactions.
    *   **Code Quality:**
        *   *Style Adherence:* (If applicable) Measure adherence to predefined style guides or analyze stylistic consistency using code analysis tools. Compare generated code style to user's baseline style (potentially gathered from their GitHub).
        *   *Semantic Similarity:* Compare final code against reference solutions (if available) using metrics like CodeBLEU or semantic embeddings.
    *   **User Experience & Alignment:**
        *   *System Usability Scale (SUS):* Standardized questionnaire for usability.
        *   *Perceived Helpfulness/Alignment:* Custom Likert-scale questions assessing how well the assistant understood intent, adapted to preferences, and provided useful suggestions (inspired by existing H M-AI collaboration scales).
        *   *Qualitative Feedback:* Thematic analysis of think-aloud protocols and interview transcripts to understand user strategies R , frustrations, and insights into the co-adaptation process.
*   **(Optional) Longitudinal Deployment:** If feasible, conduct a longer-term deployment (e.g., 2-4 weeks) with a smaller group of developers using the adaptive assistant in their daily work to observe adaptation stability, long-term utility, and potential novelty effects.
