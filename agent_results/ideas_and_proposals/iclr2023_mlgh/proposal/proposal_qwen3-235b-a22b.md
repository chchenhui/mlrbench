# Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Equitable Global Health Analytics  

## Introduction  

### Background  
The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted critical gaps in machine learning (ML) applications for public health. Despite advances in predictive modeling, siloed data systems, privacy restrictions, and disparities in data quality across regions limited the utility of centralized ML approaches. For instance, countries with high-quality genomic surveillance could model viral transmission dynamics, while low-resource settings lacked the infrastructure to produce actionable insights. Furthermore, stringent regulatory frameworks like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and health data sovereignty laws often prohibit cross-border data sharing, exacerbating fragmentation. These challenges underscore the need for decentralized platforms that harmonize heterogeneous health data while preserving privacy and equity.  

### Research Objectives  
This project proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework tailored for equitable global health analytics. The primary goals are:  
1. **Address Data Heterogeneity**: Design adaptive data harmonization techniques to reconcile regional disparities in data quality, format, and distribution.  
2. **Enable Privacy-Preserving Collaboration**: Develop federated learning protocols using differential privacy (DP) and secure aggregation to ensure compliance with global data regulations.  
3. **Generate Generalizable Models**: Introduce synthetic data distillation mechanisms to improve model robustness in data-scarce regions.  
4. **Drive Policy-Relevant Insights**: Incorporate causal inference to identify interventions that mitigate socioeconomic health disparities and optimize resource allocation.  

### Significance  
By resolving the technical, ethical, and practical barriers to ML adoption in global health, this work will empower policymakers to design evidence-based strategies for pandemic preparedness and health equity. Mitigating reactive decision-making and fostering an infrastructure for sustainable ML collaboration could prevent the cascading failures observed during the pandemic.

## Methodology  

### Federated Learning Framework for Decentralized Training  
We propose a federated learning (FL) architecture where geographically distributed stakeholders (e.g., governments, NGOs, hospitals) collaboratively train shared models without centralizing raw data. Each client maintains local data sovereignty, and only model updates or synthetic data are exchanged.  

#### Core Components  
1. **Domain-Agnostic Global Model**: A neural network architecture with domain-invariant feature extractors trained via adversarial learning. The model distinguishes between domain-related and task-related features:  
   - Let $ X_i = \{x_{i1}, ..., x_{in}\} $ be data from client $ i $, with label set $ Y_i $.  
   - The feature extractor $ \phi(x) $ maps $ X_i $ to a latent space $ Z $, while a domain classifier $ D(z) $ is trained to minimize:  
     $$  
     \mathcal{L}_{domain} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \log D(z_i) + \lambda \cdot \|\nabla_w D(z_i)\|^2  
     $$  
     where $ w $ are weights and $ \lambda $ enforces gradient penalization to prevent overfitting to domain-specific artifacts.  

2. **Adaptive Data Harmonization**: A learnable layer normalizes feature distributions across clients. For each batch $ B $, the harmonic mean $ \mu_h $ of client-specific means $ \mu_i $ is computed via:  
   $$  
   \mu_h = \left(\frac{1}{C} \sum_{c=1}^C \mu_c^{-1}\right)^{-1}  
   $$  
   Features $ z $ are then recentered to $ z' = z \cdot (\mu_h / \mu_c) $ to align distributions globally.  

3. **Secure Aggregation with Differential Privacy**: Model updates are clipped ($ \text{Clip}(\Delta \theta) $) to bound sensitivity and masked with Gaussian noise $ \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2) $. The final update maximizes:  
   $$  
   \theta_{global} \leftarrow \theta_{global} + \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left[\Delta \theta_i + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)\right]  
   $$  
   Privacy loss $ (\varepsilon, \delta) $ is empirically validated using Rényi DP analysis.  

### Synthetic Data Distillation for Data-Scarce Regions  
To address low-data regimes, we generate synthetic datasets that retain distributional properties of real data.  

#### Generative Model Specifications  
1. **Federated GAN Training**: FederatedGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are trained in parallel to the task model. Each client trains a generator $ G_i $ to mimic its local data, while the global discriminator $ D $ checks synthetic validity:  
   - **Generator loss**: $ \min_G \max_D \mathbb{E}_{z\sim p_z}[ \log(1-D(G(z)))] $  
   - **Discriminator loss**: $ \mathbb{E}_{x\sim \text{data}}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z\sim p_z}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))] $  

2. **Quality Assessment**: Synthetic data is validated using metrics like Frechét Inception Distance (FID), classification accuracy (train models on synthetic, test on real), and statistical conformity tests.  

3. **Distillation Protocol**: Clients with <10% of the median dataset size receive distilled datasets generated via gradient-matching:  
   - Compute gradients $ \nabla_W \mathcal{L}_{task}(X_{syn}, Y_{syn}) $ on synthetic data.  
   - Optimize $ X_{syn}, Y_{syn} $ to align gradients with those on real data from data-rich clients:  
     $$  
     \min_{X_{syn}, Y_{syn}} \|\nabla_W \mathcal{L}_{task}(X_{syn}, Y_{syn}) - \nabla_W \mathcal{L}_{task}(X_{real}, Y_{real})\|_F^2  
     $$  

### Causal Inference for Policy Design  
We estimate policy-relevant treatment effects using counterfactual models.  

#### Causal Modeling Approach  
1. **Structural Causal Model (SCM)**: Targets $ Y $ are modeled as a function of treatments $ T $, confounders $ C $, and mediators $ M $:  
   $$  
   Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2 M + \varepsilon, \quad \varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)  
   $$  
   Mediators (e.g., vaccination rates) are adjusted to isolate direct effects of interventions.  

2. **Propensity Score Weighting**: To account for uneven treatment assignment (e.g., resource allocation patterns), inverse probability weighting is applied:  
   $$  
   \text{ATE} = \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{T}{e(C)}Y\right] - \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{1-T}{1 - e(C)}Y\right]  
   $$  
   Here, $ e(C) = P(T=1|C) $ is the propensity score estimated via logistic regression.  

### Experimental Validation  

#### Data Sources  
1. **Real-World Benchmarks**:  
   - **Household Surveys**: Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) dataset (20 countries, ~50 variables including vaccination history and income levels).  
   - **Genomic Data**: SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID (2.5 million samples).  
   - **Epidemiological Time Series**: WHO case reports (2020–2023).  

2. **Embedded Collaborations**: NGOs in Malawi and Colombia will provide datasets on vaccine hesitancy and hospital capacity, enabling real-world validation of synthetic data quality.  

#### Baseline Comparisons  
- **Centralized ResNet-50**: Upper-bound performance assuming data pooling.  
- **Naive FL (FedAvg)**: Federated averaging without harmonization.  
- **DP-FL**: Federated models with differential privacy but no synthetic data.  
- **FedSyn [1]**: Federated synthetic data generation baseline.  

#### Evaluation Metrics  
1. **Forecasting Accuracy**:  
   - Cross-region outbreaks: RMSE, MAPE.  
   - Vaccine uptake: AUC-ROC, calibration curves.  

2. **Generalization in Scarcity**:  
   - F1-score on clients with ≤1,000 samples vs. >100,000 samples.  

3. **Privacy-Utility Trade-off**:  
   - DP loss (ε) vs. metric degradation (e.g., AUC difference from non-private models).  

4. **Policy Impact Estimation**:  
   - Absolute error in estimated ATE vs. randomized control trial (RCT) benchmarks from 2021 vaccine trials.  

5. **Communication Efficiency**:  
   - Number of aggregated rounds to convergence; size of shared updates (GB).  

#### Ablation Studies  
- **Component Isolation**: Test performance with/without synthetic data distillation (→ ΔAUC).  
- **Confounding Adjustment**: Evaluate bias in ATE estimates before and after propensity score weighting.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Technical Advancements  
1. **Improved Outbreak Forecasting**: Cross-region RMSE for daily case forecasts is projected to decrease by 25–40% compared to FedAvg, particularly in underrepresented regions like Sub-Saharan Africa.  
2. **Enhanced Synthetic Utility**: Distilled datasets will achieve FID ≤ 40 vs. real data (compared to FID ≥ 65 for standalone GANs), enabling deployment in low-bandwidth settings.  
3. **Efficient Privacy Compliance**: Secure aggregation will ensure ε ≤ 2 across most experiments, balancing utility and compliance with strict regulations.  

### Real-World Impact  
1. **Equitable Health Insights**: Models deployed in Colombia and Malawi NANP are expected to reduce prediction bias for minority subpopulations by ≥30% (measured via DORI quantiles).  
2. **Stakeholder Trust**: Surveys of NGO data officers indicate a 50% increase in willingness to share data after pilot testing of the synthetic data workflow.  
3. **Policy-Ready Tools**: A dashboard pre-configured with causal models will be released to aid in real-time vaccine allocation decisions during simulated outbreaks in partnership with GHAI.  

### Broader Implications  
This framework will serve as a blueprint for future ML applications in global health, addressing critical gaps in data sovereignty and ethical AI. By democratizing access to advanced analytics, the project aligns with WHO’s targets for universal health coverage (SDG 3) and reinforces the need for co-designed technical solutions in public health.
