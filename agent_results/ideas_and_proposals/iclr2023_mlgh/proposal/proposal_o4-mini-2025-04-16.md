1. Title:  
Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Equitable Global Health Analytics  

2. Introduction:  
Background  
Global health data are inherently fragmented: different countries and regions collect data under diverse protocols, with varying levels of quality, completeness, and accessibility. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this fragmentation—and strict privacy regulations—hindered the rapid development of robust predictive models for case trajectories, vaccine response, and resource needs. As a result, policy makers often relied on reactive rather than proactive strategies, exacerbating health inequities in low-resource settings. While federated learning (FL) and privacy technologies (e.g., differential privacy, secure aggregation) have matured in other domains, their adoption in global health remains limited by challenges of data heterogeneity, algorithmic bias, and computational constraints.  

Research Objectives  
This project aims to design, implement, and validate a privacy-preserving federated learning framework tailored for global health analytics. The core objectives are:  
- To develop a domain-agnostic model architecture and adaptive data harmonization strategy that handle highly heterogeneous epidemiological and clinical datasets.  
- To integrate advanced privacy measures (local differential privacy and secure aggregation) with synthetic data distillation techniques that improve model generalizability in data-scarce regions.  
- To incorporate causal inference methods into the federated setting, enabling estimation of policy-relevant intervention effects while accounting for socioeconomic confounders.  
- To evaluate the framework on real-world global health datasets (e.g., COVID-19 case counts, electronic health records, genomic surveillance data) and with NGO and public-sector partners, measuring predictive performance, fairness across regions, privacy guarantees, and computational feasibility.  

Significance  
By bridging the gap between state-of-the-art FL research and real global health applications, this work will empower decision makers with accurate, privacy-compliant models that generalize across diverse settings. It will foster international collaboration, respect data sovereignty, and lay the groundwork for proactive responses to future pandemics and ongoing health inequalities.  

3. Methodology:  

3.1 Overview of the Federated Framework  
We adopt a cross-silo federated learning architecture with a central aggregator and a set of $N$ participating regions (clients). Each client $i$ holds a local dataset $\mathcal{D}_i$ of size $n_i$, consisting of features $X_i$ (e.g., case counts, demographic and socioeconomic variables, genomic signatures) and labels $Y_i$ (e.g., outbreak onset, hospitalization rates, vaccine efficacy). We denote total data size $n=\sum_i n_i$.  

3.2 Domain-Agnostic Model and Adaptive Harmonization  
To address distributional heterogeneity, we propose a hybrid model consisting of:  
- A shared encoder $E_{\mathrm{shared}}:\,X\to \mathbb{R}^d$ that learns domain-invariant representations.  
- Per-client domain discriminator networks $D_i:\, \mathbb{R}^d\to \{0,1\}$ trained adversarially to encourage $E_{\mathrm{shared}}$ to produce indistinguishable features across clients.  
- A global classifier/regressor $C:\,\mathbb{R}^d\to Y$.  

The adversarial loss at client $i$ is  
$$
\min_{E_{\mathrm{shared}}}\max_{D_i}\;\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{adv}}^{(i)}
=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim \mathcal{D}_i}\bigl[\log D_i(E_{\mathrm{shared}}(x))\bigr]
+\mathbb{E}_{j\neq i}\mathbb{E}_{x\sim \mathcal{D}_j}\bigl[\log(1-D_i(E_{\mathrm{shared}}(x)))\bigr].
$$  

We also incorporate a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) penalty across all pairs of clients to further align distributions:  
$$
\mathrm{MMD}^2(\mathcal{D}_i,\mathcal{D}_j)
=\mathbb{E}_{x,x'\sim \mathcal{D}_i}[k(x,x')]
+\mathbb{E}_{y,y'\sim \mathcal{D}_j}[k(y,y')]
-2\,\mathbb{E}_{x\sim \mathcal{D}_i,y\sim \mathcal{D}_j}[k(x,y)]\,,
$$  
where $k(\cdot,\cdot)$ is a positive-definite kernel.  

3.3 Privacy-Preserving Federated Optimization  
Each client minimizes a combined loss  
$$
\mathcal{L}_i(w)
=\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{task}}^{(i)}(w)
+\alpha\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{adv}}^{(i)}
+\beta\,\mathrm{MMD}^2(\mathcal{D}_i,\{\mathcal{D}_j\}_{j\neq i})\,,
$$  
where $w$ denotes the parameters of $E_{\mathrm{shared}}$ and $C$. The global objective is  
$$
\min_w \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{n_i}{n}\mathcal{L}_i(w)\,.
$$  
Local update at round $t$:  
1. Compute stochastic gradient $g_i^t = \nabla_w \mathcal{L}_i(w^t)$ on minibatches.  
2. Clip $\|g_i^t\|_2\le \Delta$ and add Gaussian noise $\xi_i^t\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2\Delta^2I)$ to ensure $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy.  
3. Securely send $g_i^t+\xi_i^t$ using a secure aggregation protocol (e.g., SecAgg).  

Aggregator update:  
$$
w^{t+1} = w^t - \eta \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{n_i}{n}\bigl(g_i^t+\xi_i^t\bigr).
$$  

3.4 Synthetic Data Distillation  
Inspired by FedSyn and Secure Federated Data Distillation (SFDD), each client trains a local generator $G_i(z;\phi_i)$ to produce synthetic samples that distill the knowledge of its private data. During local training clients solve:  
$$
\min_{\phi_i} \mathbb{E}_{z\sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)}\bigl\|\varphi\bigl(f(w^t;G_i(z))\bigr)
-\mu_{\mathrm{global}}\bigr\|_2^2
+\gamma\,\mathcal{R}(\phi_i)\,,
$$  
where $\varphi(\cdot)$ maps to a layer-wise feature, $\mu_{\mathrm{global}}$ is the global feature centroid broadcast by the server, and $\mathcal{R}$ is a regularizer. Clients share only synthetic batches $\{G_i(z_j)\}$ and encrypted $\phi_i$ updates, preserving privacy. The server fine-tunes $w$ on the aggregated synthetic dataset to improve performance in low-data regimes.  

3.5 Incorporating Causal Modeling  
To estimate the effect of policy levers (e.g., lockdown intensity $A$) on outcomes $Y$ (e.g., infection rate), while controlling for confounders $Z$ (e.g., socioeconomic index), we embed a structural causal model. We estimate the average causal effect  
$$
\tau = E[Y\mid do(A=1)] - E[Y\mid do(A=0)]
$$  
via the back-door adjustment:  
$$
E[Y\mid do(A=a)] = \sum_{z} E[Y\mid A=a,Z=z]\,P(Z=z).
$$  
Clients compute local summaries $E[Y\mid A,Z]$ and $P(Z)$ under DP, send encrypted aggregates, and the server combines them to obtain $\tau$.  

3.6 Algorithmic Workflow  
For $t=1\ldots T$ federated rounds:  
1. Server broadcasts $(w^t,\mu_{\mathrm{global}}^t)$ to all clients.  
2. Each client $i$ in parallel:  
   a. Compute private gradient $g_i^t$ for $\mathcal{L}_i$; clip and add noise for DP.  
   b. Update generator $G_i$ via synthetic distillation objective.  
   c. Encrypt and send $\{g_i^t+\xi_i^t,\Delta\phi_i\}$.  
3. Server performs secure aggregation, updates $w^{t+1}$.  
4. Every $K$ rounds, server collects synthetic samples from clients, fine-tunes $w$ on the union of synthetic sets.  
5. Upon convergence, clients compute local causal summaries; server computes global $\tau$.  

3.7 Experimental Design and Evaluation  
Datasets:  
- Real-world: COVID-19 daily case counts and NPIs from Johns Hopkins and OxCGRT; EHR and vaccination records from partner NGOs in three continents; genomic surveillance samples.  
- Synthetic benchmarks: epidemiological simulators under different reporting biases and missing-data patterns.  

Baselines: FedAvg, FedSyn, SFDD, FedKR, centralized training (upper bound).  

Metrics:  
- Predictive accuracy: RMSE and MAE for time-series forecasts; F1-score for outbreak detection.  
- Fairness: max–min performance gap across clients; statistical parity in risk prediction.  
- Privacy: $(\varepsilon,\delta)$ budget consumption; empirical membership-inference attack success rate.  
- Synthetic quality: MMD and KL divergence between real and synthetic feature distributions.  
- Computational & communication cost: bytes transmitted per round; local FLOPs; wall-clock convergence time.  
- Causal estimation: bias and mean squared error of $\tau$ against ground truth in simulation.  

Implementation:  
- Framework: PyTorch + Flower federated library; secure aggregation via TF Encrypted or crypten.  
- Hyperparameters: clipping norm $\Delta$, noise scale $\sigma$, learning rate $\eta$, distillation weight $\gamma$, adversarial weight $\alpha$, MMD weight $\beta$.  
- Deployment: experiments on AWS EC2 (GPUs) and low-power Raspberry Pi clusters emulating low-resource clients.
