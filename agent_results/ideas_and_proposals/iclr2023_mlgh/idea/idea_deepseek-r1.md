**Title:** Federated Learning with Incentive Mechanisms for Global Health Data Collaboration  

**Motivation:** Global health initiatives are hindered by fragmented, siloed health data across regions and institutions, exacerbated by privacy concerns and lack of incentives for data sharing. This limits the development of robust ML models for pandemic prediction, resource allocation, and health equity.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a federated learning (FL) framework that integrates *differential privacy* and *game theory-based incentive mechanisms* to enable secure, privacy-preserving collaboration among health organizations. The framework would (1) use FL to train models on decentralized data without raw data exchange, (2) apply adaptive differential privacy to balance utility and privacy, and (3) design a reward system (e.g., Shapley value or blockchain tokens) to incentivize participation proportional to data quality and contribution impact. This approach would be validated on multi-country COVID-19 datasets to predict transmission hotspots and optimize vaccine distribution. Expected outcomes include scalable, equitable models that respect data sovereignty while improving global health outcomes. The impact would bridge ML advancements with policy needs, enabling proactive responses to future pandemics and reducing health inequalities through inclusive data practices.
