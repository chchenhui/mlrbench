**Title:** Cross-Modal Semantic Poisoning Attacks on Large Multimodal Models

**Motivation:** Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) integrate diverse data streams (e.g., image, text), creating complex inter-modal dependencies. While data poisoning attacks are known, their cross-modal implications in LMMs are underexplored. We aim to investigate if poisoning data in one modality can subtly corrupt the model's understanding and generation capabilities in *another* modality, leading to potentially harmful or biased outputs during inference, even on clean inputs of the second modality.

**Main Idea:** We propose a novel "Cross-Modal Semantic Poisoning" attack where we subtly manipulate training data in one modality (e.g., adding specific patterns to images associated with certain concepts) to induce targeted misbehavior in another modality (e.g., generating biased or toxic text when prompted about related concepts, even without the poisoned image). Methodology involves crafting poisoned samples for one modality (e.g., images) and fine-tuning/training an LMM. Evaluation will measure the success rate of inducing targeted textual outputs on clean text prompts related to the concepts targeted during image poisoning. This research will expose critical vulnerabilities in multimodal training pipelines and inform robust data sanitization and defense strategies for LMMs.
