### Title: "Enhancing Adversarial Robustness of Large Multimodal Models via Cross-Modal Defenses"

### Motivation:
The rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs) has significantly improved AI capabilities in vision and language applications. However, these models are increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can exploit cross-modal interactions to compromise their performance. This research aims to address these vulnerabilities by developing cross-modal defensive strategies that enhance the robustness of LMMs against adversarial threats.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research focuses on enhancing the adversarial robustness of LMMs by leveraging cross-modal defenses. The methodology involves:
1. **Cross-Modal Adversarial Training**: Developing a training framework that incorporates adversarial examples from both vision and language modalities to improve the model's resilience against cross-modal attacks.
2. **Multimodal Defense Mechanisms**: Designing and implementing defensive mechanisms that protect LMMs from cross-modal vulnerabilities, such as cross-modal watermarking and cross-modal noise injection.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Establishing new metrics to quantify the effectiveness of cross-modal defenses, focusing on both performance and robustness under adversarial conditions.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved adversarial robustness of LMMs.
- Novel cross-modal defense strategies that can be applied to various LMM architectures.
- Enhanced understanding of cross-modal vulnerabilities and their mitigation.

The potential impact includes:
- More secure and reliable AI systems that can operate in adversarial environments.
- Advancements in the field of adversarial machine learning, particularly at the intersection with multimodal technologies.
- Contributions to the broader goal of making AI systems more resilient and ethical.
