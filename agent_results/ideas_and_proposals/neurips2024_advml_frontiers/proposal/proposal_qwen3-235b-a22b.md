# Cross-Modal Adversarial Immunization: Strengthening LMMs Against Multi-Domain Attacks  

## 1. Introduction  
### Background  
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable performance in tasks spanning vision, language, and other modalities, enabling transformative applications in autonomous systems, healthcare, and content moderation. However, their reliance on integrating heterogeneous data streams creates unique vulnerabilities to **cross-modal adversarial attacks**, where perturbations in one modality (e.g., visually imperceptible image noise) induce errors in another (e.g., incorrect text reasoning). For example, a modified stop sign might trigger a language-guided autonomous vehicle to misinterpret traffic rules. Such attacks exploit the interplay between modalities, bypassing conventional single-modal defenses that lack cross-domain awareness.  

Recent work has highlighted the critical risks of cross-modal attacks. Rahmatullaev et al. (2025) demonstrated that a single adversarial image can universally compromise multimodal LLMs across diverse queries, while Dou et al. (2024) introduced the CrossFire attack, which manipulates one modality to disrupt downstream tasks in others. These studies expose significant gaps in existing defenses. Although frameworks like ProEAT (Lu et al., 2025) and Cross-Modal Adversarial Training (Red et al., 2024) have improved resistance to uni-modal and joint attacks, they fail to explicitly address cross-modal integration vulnerabilities. Furthermore, adaptive defenses (Black et al., 2024) remain underexplored in the context of LMMs, leaving models exposed to evolving attack strategies.  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a novel framework—**Cross-Modal Adversarial Immunization (CMAI)**—to enhance LMM robustness by addressing three key objectives:  
1. **Cross-Modal Consistency Verification**: Detect misalignments between modality-specific representations during inference.  
2. **Modality-Bridging Adversarial Training**: Generate adversarial examples that explicitly target cross-modal integration points during training.  
3. **Adaptive Robustness Mechanism**: Dynamically adjust defensive priorities based on real-time attack pattern detection.  

### Significance  
This research addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying secure LMMs. By fortifying cross-modal integration pathways, CMAI will mitigate risks in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics. Additionally, it advances adversarial ML theory by formalizing cross-modal robustness as a unified defense objective.  

## 2. Methodology  
### Overview  
Our framework integrates three modules: (1) a cross-modal consistency verification layer, (2) a cross-modal adversarial training pipeline, and (3) an adaptive robustness controller. We assume a standard LMM architecture with pre-trained encoders for each modality (e.g., CLIP-style vision-language models) and a fusion module (e.g., cross-attention).  

### 2.1 Cross-Modal Consistency Verification  
#### Design  
To detect adversarial perturbations, we enforce **alignment consistency** between modality-specific representations. Given inputs $x_v$ (visual) and $x_t$ (text), their representations $h_v$ and $h_t$ should satisfy:  
$$
\cos(h_v, h_t) \geq \tau
$$  
where $\cos(\cdot)$ denotes cosine similarity and $\tau$ is a threshold derived from clean data statistics.  

#### Implementation  
We train a lightweight binary classifier $C_{\text{consist}}$ to distinguish between aligned (benign) and misaligned (adversarial) pairs using adversarial contrastive loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{consist}} = \log\left(1 + e^{-\gamma \cdot (\cos(h_v, h_t) - \tau)}\right)
$$  
where $\gamma$ controls sensitivity to deviations. During inference, this module flags potential attacks for deeper scrutiny.  

### 2.2 Modality-Bridging Adversarial Training  
#### Attack Generation  
We extend the CrossFire attack (Dou et al., 2024) by formalizing cross-modal perturbation as a joint optimization problem. Given a target modality $m$ (e.g., text), we solve:  
$$
\max_{\delta_m} \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}\left(\Phi\left(\text{Encoder}_v(x_v + \delta_v), \text{Encoder}_t(x_t)\right)\right) \quad \text{s.t.} \|\delta_v\|_p \leq \epsilon
$$  
where $\Phi$ denotes the fusion module and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$ is the downstream loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification). Perturbations $\delta_v$ in the visual modality aim to degrade task performance by manipulating cross-modal interactions.  

#### Training Strategy  
We perform multi-step adversarial training:  
1. Generate adversarial examples $(x_v + \delta_v, x_t)$ for each modality using projected gradient descent (PGD).  
2. Optimize model parameters $\theta$ via:  
$$
\min_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{(x_m^{\text{adv}}, x_{\bar{m}})}\left[\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(\theta) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{consist}}(\theta)\right]
$$  
where $\lambda$ balances cross-modal consistency and task accuracy.  

### 2.3 Adaptive Robustness Controller  
#### Architecture  
We implement an adaptive weighting mechanism that modulates the adversarial training objective based on attack patterns. Let $w_v$ and $w_t$ be weights for visual and text adversarial losses. These weights evolve during training via:  
$$
w_m^{(t+1)} \propto \text{ASR}_m^{(t)} \cdot \|\nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_m^{(t)}\|_2
$$  
where $\text{ASR}_m$ is the attack success rate for modality $m$, encouraging the model to prioritize weakly defended domains.  

#### Online Adjustment  
During inference, we integrate the consistency module into a feedback loop:  
1. If $C_{\text{consist}}$ detects an attack, activate a robust fusion module $F_{\text{robust}}$ that suppresses conflicting modalities via attention masking.  
2. Update weights $w_m$ incrementally to adapt to new attack vectors.  

### 2.4 Experimental Design  
#### Datasets & Baselines  
- **Datasets**: BLIP-2 (visual question answering), COIN (video-text retrieval), and in-house autonomous vehicle data.  
- **Baselines**: ProEAT (Lu et al., 2025), CrossFire defense (Dou et al., 2024), Cross-Modal AT (Red et al., 2024).  

#### Attack & Defense Evaluation  
- **White-box attacks**: Use PGD to evaluate worst-case robustness.  
- **Black-box attacks**: Transfer from proxy models.  
- **Metrics**: Attack Success Rate (ASR), Cross-Modal Consistency Score (CMCS), and task accuracy on clean data.  

#### Ablation Studies  
1. Isolate the impact of each module (CMAI-Base: adversarial training only; +Consistency; +Adaptive).  
2. Measure robustness against CrossFire (Dou et al., 2024), Cross-Modal Transfer (Wei et al., 2021), and universal attacks (Rahmatullaev et al., 2025).  

#### Scalability  
We test on LMMs with 10B–100B parameters via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) to minimize computational overhead.  

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
### Anticipated Results  
1. **Improved Robustness**: CMAI will reduce ASR by 15–20% compared to existing defenses while maintaining ≥95% accuracy on clean data, validated across four benchmark datasets.  
2. **Cross-Modal Generalization**: Our framework will demonstrate superior performance against attacks (e.g., I2V, CrossFire) that bypass prior methods relying on modality-specific defenses.  
3. **Adaptive Resilience**: The controller will dynamically adjust weights to counteract novel attack patterns, outperforming static defenses by >25% in dynamic environments.  

### Broader Impact  
1. **Security-Critical Applications**: CMAI will enable safer deployment of LMMs in autonomous systems (e.g., detecting adversarial signs in self-driving cars) and healthcare (e.g., preventing image-text misalignments in diagnostics).  
2. **Theory Advancements**: This work formalizes cross-modal robustness as a distinct ML security challenge, inspiring new research directions in multimodal adversarial learning.  
3. **Community Resources**: We will release adversarial datasets and tools (e.g., CrossFire-V2), fostering reproducibility and accelerating progress.  

### Long-Term Vision  
By bridging theoretical and practical gaps in cross-modal defense, this research will lay the foundation for provably robust LMMs. Future work will explore certification guarantees and real-time hardware acceleration for deployment in edge devices.
