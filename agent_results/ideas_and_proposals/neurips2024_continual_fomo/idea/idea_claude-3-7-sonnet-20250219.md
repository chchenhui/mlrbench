# Adaptive Knowledge Pruning for Efficient Continual Learning in Foundation Models

## Motivation
Foundation Models (FMs) face the challenge of catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned on smaller datasets, often losing previously learned knowledge. Current continual learning (CL) approaches either store previous data (memory-intensive) or penalize weight changes (limiting adaptation). As models grow larger, we need more efficient methods that can preserve essential knowledge while allowing meaningful updates without the computational overhead of retraining from scratch.

## Main Idea
I propose a dynamic knowledge pruning framework that identifies and preserves critical knowledge pathways in FMs during continual learning. The approach works by: (1) using importance scoring to identify neurons/attention heads that encode fundamental knowledge versus task-specific information; (2) adaptively pruning less-critical pathways to create capacity for new knowledge; and (3) implementing sparse fine-tuning that primarily updates the pruned pathways while minimally disturbing critical ones. This creates a hierarchical knowledge structure where fundamental concepts remain stable while task-specific knowledge evolves. Experiments would compare this approach against traditional fine-tuning and parameter-efficient methods across language and vision domains, measuring both retention of core knowledge and adaptation to new data. This framework could dramatically reduce computational requirements while maintaining model performance, making continual learning practical for real-world FM deployment.
