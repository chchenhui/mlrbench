**Research Proposal: Physics-Informed Graph Normalizing Flows for Molecular Conformation Generation**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Molecular conformation generation, which involves predicting the 3D spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule, is a cornerstone of computational chemistry and drug discovery. Accurate conformer generation enables researchers to study molecular interactions, screen drug candidates, and design materials with tailored properties. Traditional approaches rely on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or Monte Carlo methods, which are computationally expensive and scale poorly for large molecules. Recent advances in generative models—such as variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and diffusion models—have shown promise for accelerating conformation sampling. However, these methods often produce chemically invalid structures or neglect physical constraints (e.g., bond lengths, energy minima), limiting their practical utility.  

**Research Objectives**  
This work proposes a **physics-informed graph normalizing flow (PIGNF)** framework to address these challenges. Our objectives are:  
1. To design a **graph-based normalizing flow** architecture that respects roto-translational invariance and permutational symmetry inherent to molecular structures.  
2. To integrate **physics-based energy penalties** into the training loss, ensuring generated conformations adhere to domain-specific constraints (e.g., bond lengths, torsional angles, Lennard-Jones potentials).  
3. To enable **efficient and diverse sampling** of low-energy conformations in a single forward pass, bypassing iterative refinement steps.  
4. To empirically validate the model’s performance across small and large molecules, focusing on chemical validity, diversity, and computational efficiency.  

**Significance**  
Molecular design pipelines require generative models that balance speed, diversity, and adherence to physical laws. By embedding domain knowledge directly into the architecture and training process, PIGNF bridges the gap between data-driven generative modeling and physics-based simulation. This approach has broad applications in drug discovery, catalytic material design, and protein structure prediction, where both speed and physical plausibility are critical.

### 2. **Methodology**  
**Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
- **Datasets**: Use the **GEOM-QM9** (small molecules) and **GEOM-Drugs** (larger drug-like molecules) datasets, which include experimentally validated conformers and their energies.  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Represent molecules as labeled graphs with nodes (atom type, charge) and edges (bond type, pairwise distances).  
  - Normalize coordinates by centering at the molecule’s centroid and aligning with principal axes to remove roto-translational variance.  
  - Split data into training/test sets (80/20) and augment via random rotations/translations.  

**Model Architecture**  
PIGNF combines **graph normalizing flows** with **physics-informed loss terms**:  
1. **Graph Normalizing Flow Layers**:  
   - **Input**: A molecular graph $G=(V,E)$ with node features $\mathbf{h}_v \in \mathbb{R}^d$ (atom type, charge) and edge features $\mathbf{e}_{uv} \in \mathbb{R}^k$ (bond type, distance).  
   - **Invertible Transformation**: Apply a sequence of *equivariant graph coupling layers* that update node coordinates $\mathbf{x}_v \in \mathbb{R}^3$ while preserving permutation and roto-translational invariance. Each layer splits nodes into two subsets $A$ and $B$ and transforms $\mathbf{x}_B$ conditioned on $\mathbf{x}_A$:  
     $$
     \mathbf{x}_B^{t+1} = \mathbf{x}_B^t \odot \exp(s(\mathbf{h}_A^t)) + t(\mathbf{h}_A^t),
     $$  
     where $s(\cdot)$ and $t(\cdot)$ are parameterized by graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to subset $A$.  
   - **Permutation Invariance**: Use edge-conditioned message passing to aggregate neighbor information symmetrically.  

2. **Physics-Informed Energy Penalty**:  
   A lightweight force-field approximation computes the potential energy $E(\mathbf{X})$ of a conformation $\mathbf{X}$:  
   $$
   E(\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{\text{bonds}} k_r(r - r_0)^2 + \sum_{\text{angles}} k_\theta(\theta - \theta_0)^2 + \sum_{\text{non-bonded}} \left( \frac{A}{r^{12}} - \frac{B}{r^6} \right),
   $$  
   where $k_r$, $k_\theta$, $A$, and $B$ are constants derived from molecular mechanics. This term penalizes high-energy configurations during training.  

3. **Training Objective**:  
   The total loss $L_{\text{total}}$ combines the negative log-likelihood ($L_{\text{NLL}}$) from the flow model and the energy penalty:  
   $$
   L_{\text{total}} = -\log p_{\text{model}}(\mathbf{X}) + \lambda \cdot E(\mathbf{X}),
   $$  
   where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter balancing the two terms.  

**Algorithmic Steps**  
1. **Forward Pass**: Map input conformations $\mathbf{X}$ to latent space $\mathbf{z}$ via invertible transformations.  
2. **Inverse Pass**: Generate new conformations by sampling $\mathbf{z} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ and applying inverse transformations.  
3. **Physics Loss Computation**: Calculate $E(\mathbf{X})$ for generated samples.  
4. **Backpropagation**: Update model weights to minimize $L_{\text{total}}$.  

**Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against ConfFlow (flow-based), GeoDiff (diffusion), MolGrow (graph NF), and GraphEBM (energy-based).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Validity**: Percentage of conformers with chemically valid bond lengths and angles.  
  - **Diversity**: Coverage (COV) and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between generated and reference conformers.  
  - **Energy**: Average potential energy of generated samples relative to ground truth.  
  - **Efficiency**: Time per conformation sample (ms).  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform paired t-tests across 5 runs to assess significance (p < 0.05).

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Validity**: PIGNF will yield chemically valid conformers (>95% validity rate vs. ~80% for baseline VAEs/GANs).  
2. **Enhanced Diversity**: COV and MMD scores will surpass diffusion models by 15–20% due to the flow’s exact likelihood training.  
3. **Lower Energy Conformations**: Generated samples will have energy levels within 5% of MD-simulated ground truths, outperforming ConfFlow and GeoDiff.  
4. **Faster Sampling**: Single-pass sampling will reduce inference time to <10 ms per conformer, 10× faster than diffusion models.  

**Impact**  
By integrating physical laws into a generative framework, PIGNF will advance molecular design in three ways:  
1. **Accelerated Drug Discovery**: Rapid generation of valid conformers will streamline virtual screening pipelines.  
2. **Interpretability**: The energy penalty term provides a direct mechanism to enforce domain knowledge, enhancing trust in AI-generated structures.  
3. **Cross-Domain Applicability**: The methodology can be adapted to other structured data domains (e.g., proteins, materials) requiring physics-aware generation.  

**Broader Implications**  
This work aligns with the workshop’s goals by addressing structured probabilistic inference challenges in scientific applications. The proposed framework exemplifies how domain knowledge can be systematically encoded into generative models, fostering collaboration between machine learning and natural science communities.
