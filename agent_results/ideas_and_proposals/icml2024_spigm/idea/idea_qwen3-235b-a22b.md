1. **Title:** Physics-Informed Hierarchical Variational Inference for Structured Spatiotemporal Systems  

2. **Motivation:**  
Many scientific domains, such as materials science and fluid dynamics, rely on spatiotemporal systems governed by known physical laws (e.g., conservation laws, PDEs). However, existing probabilistic models for structured data (e.g., temporal graphs, spatial grids) often ignore these constraints, leading to unphysical predictions. Integrating mechanistic knowledge into structured generative models is critical for ensuring feasibility in downstream applications, particularly for high-stakes tasks like plasma confinement modeling in fusion reactors or climate simulation.  

3. **Main Idea:**  
Propose a hierarchical Bayesian framework that merges physics-based symbolic knowledge with graph neural networks (GNNs) for structured spatiotemporal data. The model explicitly embeds physical laws as differentiable constraints within the variational inference objective, penalizing deviations from expected dynamics (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flows). GNNs will represent spatial relationships, while temporal dependencies are modeled via neural ODEs, enabling exact time integration. Adaptive graph coarsening algorithms will address scalability challenges, allowing efficient inference on large-scale systems. Methodologically, this integrates symbolic constraints into stochastic variational learning, ensuring that posterior approximations respect domain knowledge. Expected outcomes include physically consistent generative models with uncertainty quantification, improved generalization on sparse datasets, and reduced computational costs via physics-guided parameter sparsity. Impact: Enabling accurate simulation of complex systems in nuclear physics, climate science, and biomedical engineering, while fostering trustless AI frameworks for critical domains.
