## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **Symplectic Neural Architectures for Enforcing Geometric Conservation Laws in Machine Learning**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
The intersection of physics and machine learning (ML) represents a vibrant and rapidly evolving frontier in artificial intelligence research. While significant progress has been made in applying ML techniques to solve complex problems within the physical sciences (Pfau et al., 2020; Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020), a compelling and less explored avenue involves leveraging fundamental principles and structures from physics to design novel, more robust, and interpretable ML models (Cohen & Welling, 2016; Cranmer et al., 2020). This aligns strongly with the focus of the "Physics for Machine Learning" workshop, aiming to exploit physical insights, such as symmetries and conservation laws, to enhance ML methods for both scientific and classical applications.

Many real-world systems, particularly those described by classical mechanics, adhere to fundamental geometric conservation laws. Hamiltonian mechanics, for instance, provides a powerful framework describing the evolution of physical systems in terms of energy (Hamiltonian) and phase space coordinates (position and momentum). A key property of Hamiltonian dynamics is symplecticity – the preservation of phase space volume during evolution, mathematically expressed by the transformations being symplectic maps. This geometric structure implies crucial physical invariants, such as the conservation of energy for time-independent Hamiltonians, as described by Liouville's theorem.

However, standard deep learning architectures, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and even graph neural networks (GNNs), typically lack built-in mechanisms to respect these fundamental physical constraints. When applied to modeling physical systems like molecular dynamics or fluid simulations, these models can produce physically implausible results, such as violating energy conservation over long trajectories, leading to instability and inaccurate predictions (Greydanus et al., 2019). Furthermore, even in classical ML tasks like video prediction or time-series forecasting, the implicit dynamics learned by standard models can suffer from instability or poor generalization, potentially because they fail to capture underlying conserved quantities or structural properties analogous to physical laws.

**2.2 Research Gap and Motivation**
Recognizing this limitation, researchers have begun exploring physics-informed neural networks. Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) (Greydanus et al., 2019) learn a Hamiltonian function and use its gradients to predict dynamics, but typically rely on standard numerical integrators that only approximate symplecticity. Recent works, as highlighted in the literature review, have focused more directly on incorporating symplectic structure. For example, He & Cai (2024) proposed invertible symplectomorphism networks analogous to real NVP, while David & Méhats (2023) explored improved training via symplectic loss functions and post-training corrections. Xiong et al. (2022) tackled non-separable Hamiltonians with Nonseparable Symplectic Neural Networks (NSSNNs), and Duruisseaux et al. (2023) introduced structure-preserving networks for nearly-periodic maps. Maslovskaya & Ober-Blöbaum (2024) constructed symplectic networks based on higher-order explicit methods.

Despite these advancements, several key challenges persist, motivating this research:
*   **Inherent Architectural Enforcement:** Many current approaches enforce symplecticity approximately through integration schemes or loss functions, rather than guaranteeing it structurally within the network architecture itself for arbitrary compositions of layers. Designing flexible, expressive architectures where symplecticity is an *intrinsic property* remains an open challenge.
*   **Generalization and Training:** Ensuring that these structured networks train stably, efficiently, and generalize well, especially to complex, non-separable systems and potentially chaotic dynamics, requires further investigation (Xiong et al., 2022).
*   **Bridging to Classical ML:** The application of rigorously enforced geometric conservation laws, beyond energy conservation, to improve classical ML tasks (e.g., sequence modeling, generative modeling) is still nascent. How can principles like phase-space volume preservation benefit tasks without an obvious physical counterpart?
*   **Combining with other Structures:** Integrating symplectic constraints with other desirable properties, like equivariance (Cohen & Welling, 2016; Horie & Mitsume, 2024) or incorporating non-symplectic effects (Šípka et al., 2023), needs systematic exploration.

**2.3 Proposed Research: Symplectic Neural Networks (SympNets)**
This research proposes to develop **Symplectic Neural Networks (SympNets)**, a class of deep learning architectures designed to inherently preserve symplectic structures and associated geometric conservation laws. The core idea is to structure network layers or blocks such that each transformation explicitly represents a **symplectic map**. We will leverage principles from geometric integration, particularly **Hamiltonian splitting methods** (Leimkuhler & Reich, 2004), to decompose the layer's transformation into simpler, analytically symplectic steps corresponding to components of a learned Hamiltonian (e.g., kinetic and potential energy). By parameterizing these components using neural networks and composing them according to structure-preserving integration schemes, the resulting network layer will, by construction, approximate a symplectic map.

This approach aims to directly embed the inductive bias of Hamiltonian dynamics into the network architecture, potentially leading to:
*   Improved physical plausibility and long-term stability in scientific simulations.
*   Enhanced training stability and data efficiency due to the strong structural prior.
*   Better generalization by capturing fundamental system invariants.
*   Novel capabilities in classical ML tasks where underlying conservation principles might exist or provide beneficial regularization.

**2.4 Research Objectives**
The specific objectives of this research are:
1.  **Design Novel SympNet Layer Architectures:** Develop neural network layers based on Hamiltonian splitting methods (e.g., Verlet/Leapfrog, higher-order schemes) that are guaranteed to be symplectic or preserve symplecticity up to a controllable order. Explore variants for both separable and non-separable Hamiltonians.
2.  **Integrate SympNets into Standard Frameworks:** Investigate methods to incorporate SympNet layers effectively within different deep learning paradigms, including feedforward networks, recurrent architectures for sequence modeling, and Graph Neural Networks for interacting particle systems.
3.  **Develop Training Methodologies:** Analyze and adapt training procedures (loss functions, optimization strategies) suitable for SympNets, addressing potential challenges related to constrained optimization or gradient computation.
4.  **Evaluate on Physics-Based Benchmarks:** Rigorously test SympNets on benchmark problems from Hamiltonian dynamics (e.g., N-body problems, molecular dynamics), evaluating their accuracy, long-term stability, and ability to conserve energy and phase-space volume compared to standard NNs, HNNs, and other state-of-the-art structure-preserving models.
5.  **Explore Applications in Classical ML:** Investigate the utility of SympNets in classical ML domains, such as video prediction or time-series forecasting, assessing whether the symplectic inductive bias improves robustness, generalization, or sample efficiency.
6.  **Theoretical Analysis:** Analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed SympNet architectures, including their expressivity, approximation capabilities for symplectic maps, and guarantees regarding conservation laws.

**2.5 Significance**
This research holds the potential to significantly advance the field of physics-informed machine learning by providing a principled way to embed fundamental geometric conservation laws directly into neural network architectures. Success would lead to more reliable and trustworthy ML models for scientific discovery in physics, chemistry, and engineering. Furthermore, by demonstrating the utility of these physics-inspired structures in classical ML tasks, this work could open new avenues for designing robust and efficient AI systems more broadly. It directly addresses the key themes of the workshop by leveraging physics structure (symplecticity) for ML, interpreting dynamics through a physical lens, and bridging insights from physics to classical ML problems.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Theoretical Foundation: Hamiltonian Mechanics and Symplectic Maps**
We consider dynamical systems described by Hamiltonian mechanics. A system's state is given by generalized coordinates $q \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and conjugate momenta $p \in \mathbb{R}^d$, forming the phase space coordinates $z = (q, p) \in \mathbb{R}^{2d}$. The system's evolution is governed by Hamilton's equations:
$$
\frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}, \quad \frac{dp}{dt} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q}
$$
where $H(q, p, t)$ is the Hamiltonian function, often representing the system's total energy. This can be written compactly as $\frac{dz}{dt} = X_H(z)$, where $X_H(z) = J^{-1} \nabla_z H(z)$ is the Hamiltonian vector field, and $J = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & I_d \\ -I_d & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is the standard symplectic matrix ($I_d$ is the d-dimensional identity matrix).

The flow map $\Phi_t: z(0) \mapsto z(t)$ generated by Hamilton's equations is a **symplectic map**. This means its Jacobian $ M = \frac{\partial z(t)}{\partial z(0)} $ satisfies the condition:
$$
M^T J M = J
$$
Symplecticity implies the conservation of phase-space volume ($\det(M)=1$, Liouville's theorem) and is crucial for preserving the qualitative structure of Hamiltonian dynamics, including energy conservation for time-independent Hamiltonians.

**3.2 Proposed SympNet Architecture**

Our core proposal is to design neural network layers $L_\theta: \mathbb{R}^{2d} \to \mathbb{R}^{2d}$ that approximate a symplectic map $\Phi_{\Delta t}$ corresponding to evolution under a learned Hamiltonian over a small time step $\Delta t$. We will achieve this using **Hamiltonian splitting methods**.

**3.2.1 Layers based on Separable Hamiltonians:**
Assume the Hamiltonian can be split as $H(q, p) = T(p) + V(q)$, where $T(p)$ is kinetic energy (depends only on momenta) and $V(q)$ is potential energy (depends only on positions). Many physical systems fall into this category. Hamilton's equations become:
$$
\frac{dq}{dt} = \nabla_p T(p), \quad \frac{dp}{dt} = -\nabla_q V(q)
$$
The flows corresponding to $T(p)$ (denoted $\Phi_T^{\Delta t}$) and $V(q)$ (denoted $\Phi_V^{\Delta t}$) are individually symplectic and often analytically solvable:
*   Flow under $T(p)$: $\Phi_T^{\Delta t}(q, p) = (q + \Delta t \nabla_p T(p), p)$ (Update position based on momentum)
*   Flow under $V(q)$: $\Phi_V^{\Delta t}(q, p) = (q, p - \Delta t \nabla_q V(q))$ (Update momentum based on potential)

A **symplectic integrator**, like the Verlet/Leapfrog scheme, approximates the full flow $\Phi_H^{\Delta t}$ by composing these simpler flows:
*   **Leapfrog Integrator (Strang Splitting):** $\Phi_{LF}^{\Delta t} = \Phi_V^{\Delta t/2} \circ \Phi_T^{\Delta t} \circ \Phi_V^{\Delta t/2}$
    *   $p_{n+1/2} = p_n - \frac{\Delta t}{2} \nabla_q V(q_n)$
    *   $q_{n+1} = q_n + \Delta t \nabla_p T(p_{n+1/2})$
    *   $p_{n+1} = p_{n+1/2} - \frac{\Delta t}{2} \nabla_q V(q_{n+1})$

This composition of exact symplectic maps is itself a symplectic map.

**SympNet Layer Implementation (Separable Case):**
We propose a SympNet layer $L_{\theta, \phi}$ that implements such a splitting scheme, where the potential and kinetic energy *gradients* are parameterized by neural networks:
1.  Learn $\nabla_q V(q)$ using a neural network $NN_V(q; \theta)$.
2.  Learn $\nabla_p T(p)$ using a neural network $NN_T(p; \phi)$.
3.  The layer transformation $z_{out} = L_{\theta, \phi}(z_{in})$ implements the steps of a chosen symplectic integrator (e.g., Leapfrog) using $NN_V$ and $NN_T$. For example:
    $$
    p_{mid} = p_{in} - \frac{\Delta t}{2} NN_V(q_{in}; \theta)
    $$
    $$
    q_{out} = q_{in} + \Delta t NN_T(p_{mid}; \phi)
    $$
    $$
    p_{out} = p_{mid} - \frac{\Delta t}{2} NN_V(q_{out}; \theta)
    $$
Note: To ensure the learned forces are conservative (i.e., actual gradients of potentials), we can parameterize the scalar potentials $V_\theta(q)$ and $T_\phi(p)$ and compute their gradients via automatic differentiation during the forward pass. This enforces conservatism by construction. The layer parameters are $\theta$ and $\phi$. The 'time step' $\Delta t$ can be a hyperparameter or even learned. Stacking multiple such layers allows modeling complex dynamics over longer times.

**3.2.2 Extension to Non-Separable Hamiltonians:**
For non-separable $H(q, p)$, more sophisticated splitting methods or techniques based on generating functions are needed (Leimkuhler & Reich, 2004; Xiong et al., 2022).
*   **Generating Functions:** A map $(q, p) \mapsto (Q, P)$ is symplectic if it derives from a generating function $S(q, Q)$, $S(q, P)$, $S(p, Q)$, or $S(p, P)$. We can parameterize a generating function $S$ with a neural network and derive the symplectic map. Ensuring invertibility and finding explicit forms can be challenging.
*   **Implicit Symplectic Methods:** Methods like the implicit midpoint rule preserve quadratic invariants and can be symplectic. Implementing these within a layer might require solving implicit equations, possibly using iterative methods or fixed-point solvers within the forward pass.
*   **Coordinate Transformations:** Attempt to find coordinate transformations $\Psi: (q, p) \mapsto (\tilde{q}, \tilde{p})$ such that the Hamiltonian becomes separable in the new coordinates, apply the separable SympNet layer, and transform back. Parameterizing $\Psi$ and ensuring it is symplectic (a symplectomorphism) adds complexity.

**3.2.3 Integration into GNNs and Sequence Models:**
*   **SympGNNs:** For systems of interacting particles, a GNN architecture can be used. Node features would represent $(q_i, p_i)$ for particle $i$. Message passing steps could compute forces $-\nabla_{q_i} V(\{q_j\})$ based on relative positions, where $V$ is a learned interaction potential parameterized possibly by edge/node networks. The node update step would then implement a symplectic integration step using these computed forces, ensuring the overall dynamics of the interacting system respect symplectic geometry. Interaction potentials $V_\theta(\{q_j\}_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)})$ could be learned using message passing schemes followed by aggregation to produce forces.
*   **SympRNNs/Transformers:** For sequence modeling or video prediction, the hidden state $h_t$ can be interpreted as the phase space coordinates $z_t = (q_t, p_t)$. The RNN transition function $h_{t+1} = f(h_t, x_t)$ or the Transformer's self-attention/FFN block could be replaced or augmented by a SympNet layer that enforces symplectic evolution of the latent state, potentially conditioned on input $x_t$.

**3.3 Training Methodology**
*   **Loss Function:** The primary loss function $L_{task}$ will depend on the specific application (e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE) for predicting future states $z_{pred}$ vs $z_{true}$).
    $$ L = L_{task}(z_{pred}, z_{true}) $$
    Since symplecticity is enforced architecturally, we do not strictly need a physics-based regularization term for it. However, if the integrator used is only approximately symplectic (e.g., higher-order methods), or if energy conservation (for time-independent $H$) is critical, a penalty term could be added:
    $$ L = L_{task} + \lambda L_{energy} $$
    where $L_{energy} = |H_\psi(q_{pred}, p_{pred}) - H_\psi(q_{initial}, p_{initial})|$, and $H_\psi$ is the learned Hamiltonian (which can be potentially reconstructed from the learned forces/potentials $V_\theta, T_\phi$). We may compare training with and without $L_{energy}$. We will also investigate adaptive loss functions like those proposed by David & Méhats (2023) if architectural enforcement proves difficult.
*   **Optimization:** Standard gradient-based optimizers (e.g., Adam, RMSprop) will be used. We will monitor training dynamics for stability, investigating learning rates and potential need for gradient clipping, especially if implicit methods or complex coordinate transformations are employed.

*   **Classical Machine Learning:**
    *   *Video Prediction:* Bouncing balls dataset, Moving MNIST variants with collisions (where momentum/energy conservation is intuitive), potentially datasets like KTH Actions or Human3.6M focused on periodic or quasi-periodic motions.
    *   *Time-Series Forecasting:* Datasets exhibiting quasi-periodic behavior or underlying conserved quantities, potentially from finance (volatility models) or sensor readings (energy systems).

**3.4.2 Baselines:**
We will compare SympNets against:
*   **Standard NNs:** MLPs, LSTMs/GRUs, standard GNNs (e.g., GCN, Graph Nets), Transformers, depending on the task.
*   **Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs):** (Greydanus et al., 2019) using standard integrators (e.g., RK4).
*   **Other Physics-Inspired NNs:** Relevant works from the literature review, such as NSSNNs (Xiong et al., 2022), networks from He & Cai (2024), or potentially PINNs where appropriate.
*   **Graph-based solvers:** Models like Horie & Mitsume (2024) that incorporate conservation laws in GNNs for PDEs.

    *   *Energy Drift:* $\Delta E(t) = |H(z(t)) - H(z(0))|$ over long trajectories/sequences (using the learned or true Hamiltonian).
    *   *Symplecticity Deviation:* Compute the Jacobian $M$ of the learned map over one or multiple steps and measure $\| M^T J M - J \|_F$ (Frobenius norm). Alternatively, track the evolution of small phase space volumes.

*   **Data Efficiency:** Performance as a function of training dataset size. Compare sample complexity against baselines.
*   **Computational Cost:** Training time, inference time, model parameter count.

*   **Trustworthy AI:** Embedding fundamental laws like energy conservation can increase the reliability and trustworthiness of ML models, particularly in safety-critical applications where out-of-distribution behavior or violation of physical constraints is unacceptable.

In conclusion, this research proposes a principled approach to unifying geometric mechanics with deep learning through the development of Symplectic Neural Networks. By directly embedding conservation laws into the network architecture, we anticipate significant improvements in model fidelity for scientific applications and enhanced robustness and efficiency for classical machine learning tasks, contributing valuable tools and insights to both fields.
