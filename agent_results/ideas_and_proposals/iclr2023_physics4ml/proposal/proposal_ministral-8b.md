# Geometric Conservation Laws in Neural Networks via Symplectic Architectures

## 1. Introduction

The field of physics-informed machine learning (PhyML) seeks to leverage the rich structure and symmetries of physical systems to enhance the performance and interpretability of machine learning models. While most research in this domain focuses on applying machine learning techniques to solve physical problems, a less explored but equally important area is the converse: using insights from physics to develop novel machine learning methods. This research proposal aims to design symplectic neural networks that inherently preserve geometric conservation laws, such as energy preservation and symplecticity, by structuring layers as symplectic maps.

### 1.1 Background

Geometric conservation laws are fundamental principles in physics that describe how certain quantities (e.g., energy, momentum) remain constant or evolve in a predictable manner. These laws are essential for understanding and modeling physical systems, from molecular dynamics to fluid flow. However, traditional deep learning models often lack mechanisms to enforce these invariants, leading to unphysical behavior and unstable training dynamics. By embedding geometric constraints into neural networks, we can enhance robustness, generalization, and data efficiency.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop symplectic neural networks that preserve geometric conservation laws. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Design neural network architectures that inherently preserve symplectic structures, ensuring energy conservation and phase-space volume preservation.
2. Apply these architectures to various machine learning tasks, including physics-informed ML and classical tasks like video prediction.
3. Evaluate the performance of symplectic neural networks in terms of training stability, data efficiency, and physical plausibility of predictions.

### 1.3 Significance

The development of symplectic neural networks has the potential to unify geometric physics with machine learning, enabling trustworthy models for science and industry. By embedding geometric constraints into neural networks, we can improve the reliability and generalizability of models, particularly in domains where physical laws are well understood. Furthermore, this research can pave the way for new applications of machine learning in physics, such as improved particle physics models and molecular simulations.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Research Design

To achieve our research objectives, we will follow a systematic approach that includes the following steps:

1. **Literature Review**: Conduct a comprehensive review of existing work on symplectic neural networks and geometric conservation laws in machine learning.
2. **Architectural Design**: Develop neural network architectures that ensure symplectic preservation, using techniques such as Hamiltonian splitting and parameter constraints.
3. **Implementation and Training**: Implement the proposed architectures and train them on various datasets, using specialized loss functions and integration schemes that preserve the symplectic structure.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of symplectic neural networks in terms of training stability, data efficiency, and physical plausibility of predictions.
5. **Application**: Apply the developed architectures to physics-informed ML tasks and classical machine learning problems, such as video prediction.

### 2.2 Data Collection

For the purpose of this research, we will collect datasets relevant to the tasks at hand. These datasets may include:

1. **Physics-informed ML Datasets**: Molecular dynamics simulations, fluid dynamics simulations, and particle physics data.
2. **Classical ML Datasets**: Video prediction datasets, such as the Kinetics dataset, and sequence modeling datasets, such as the Penn Treebank dataset.

### 2.3 Algorithmic Steps

#### 2.3.1 Symplectic Neural Network Architecture

We propose a symplectic neural network architecture that structures layers as symplectic maps. Each layer decomposes transformations into energy-conserving components, enforced via parameter constraints. For example, in graph neural networks, message-passing layers could mimic particle interactions governed by Hamilton's equations, preserving system energy.

Mathematically, a symplectic map \( F \) can be represented as:

\[ F(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}) = (\mathbf{x}', \mathbf{p}') \]

where \( \mathbf{x} \) and \( \mathbf{p} \) are the position and momentum vectors, respectively, and \( \mathbf{x}' \) and \( \mathbf{p}' \) are the transformed position and momentum vectors. The symplectic condition ensures that the volume of the phase space is preserved:

\[ \det \left( \frac{\partial (\mathbf{x}', \mathbf{p}')}{\partial (\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p})} \right) = 1 \]

#### 2.3.2 Hamiltonian Splitting

To ensure energy conservation, we will employ Hamiltonian splitting methods, which decompose transformations into kinetic and potential energy components. For example, in a Hamiltonian system, the total energy \( E \) is given by:

\[ E = K + V \]

where \( K \) is the kinetic energy and \( V \) is the potential energy. By structuring neural network layers to mimic this decomposition, we can enforce energy conservation.

#### 2.3.3 Training with Symplectic Loss

To train symplectic neural networks, we will use specialized loss functions that preserve the symplectic structure. For example, the symplectic loss function can be defined as:

\[ \mathcal{L}_{\text{symp}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial \mathbf{x}_i} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial \mathbf{p}_i} \right)^2 \]

where \( E \) is the total energy, and \( \mathbf{x}_i \) and \( \mathbf{p}_i \) are the position and momentum vectors of the \( i \)-th particle.

### 2.4 Experimental Design

To validate the proposed method, we will conduct experiments on various datasets and tasks, including:

1. **Physics-informed ML Tasks**: Molecular dynamics simulations, fluid dynamics simulations, and particle physics data.
2. **Classical ML Tasks**: Video prediction and sequence modeling tasks.

For each task, we will evaluate the performance of symplectic neural networks in terms of:

1. **Training Stability**: Measured by convergence rate and stability of the training process.
2. **Data Efficiency**: Measured by the amount of data required to achieve a given level of performance.
3. **Physical Plausibility**: Measured by the accuracy of the predictions in terms of conserved quantities.

### 2.5 Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of symplectic neural networks, we will use the following metrics:

1. **Training Loss**: The average loss over time during training.
2. **Validation Loss**: The average loss on a validation set.
3. **Test Accuracy**: The accuracy of the predictions on a test set.
4. **Energy Conservation**: The extent to which the model preserves conserved quantities, such as energy.
5. **Phase-Space Volume Preservation**: The extent to which the model preserves the volume of the phase space.
