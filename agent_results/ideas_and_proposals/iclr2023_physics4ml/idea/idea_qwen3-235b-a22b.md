**Title:** Thermodynamics-Informed Generative Modeling via Entropy-Driven Neural Networks  

**Motivation:**  
Generative models often lack explicit constraints from physical laws, leading to unrealistic outputs in domains governed by thermodynamics (e.g., fluid dynamics, molecular systems). By embedding principles like entropy maximization and energy dissipation into neural networks, we can ensure physical plausibility while improving training stability and generalization. This bridges a critical gap between physics and ML, enabling applications in both scientific simulations and classical ML tasks like image generation.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose designing generative models (e.g., diffusion models, normalizing flows) that inherently respect thermodynamic laws by integrating entropy-driven dynamics into their architecture. For instance, the forward diffusion process in score-based models could mimic entropy-increasing physical processes (e.g., heat dissipation), while the reverse process enforces energy minimization. This is achieved by parameterizing neural networks with thermodynamic constraints (e.g., non-negative entropy production) and using physics-inspired loss functions. Expected outcomes include faster convergence, improved sample quality in physical systems, and broader applicability to standard ML tasks (e.g., image generation with energy-aware regularization). The approach could also inspire novel optimization algorithms that leverage entropy gradients, offering theoretical insights into the interplay between thermodynamics and learning dynamics.
