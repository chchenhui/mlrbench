**Title:** Geometric Conservation Laws in Neural Networks via Symplectic Architectures  

**Motivation:** Many physical systems adhere to geometric conservation laws (e.g., energy preservation, symplecticity in Hamiltonian mechanics), yet standard deep learning models lack mechanisms to enforce such invariants. This leads to unphysical behavior in scientific applications (e.g., fluid simulations) and unstable training dynamics in classical tasks. Embedding these geometric constraints into neural networks could enhance robustness, generalization, and data efficiency.  

**Main Idea:** Design *symplectic neural networks* that inherently preserve geometric invariants by structuring layers as symplectic maps, which conserve phase-space volume and energy in discrete steps. Leveraging Hamiltonian splitting methods, each layer would decompose transformations into energy-conserving components (e.g., kinetic/potential terms), enforced via parameter constraints. For example, in graph neural networks, message-passing layers could mimic particle interactions governed by Hamilton's equations, preserving system energy. Applications span physics-informed ML (e.g., molecular dynamics) and classical tasks like video prediction, where temporal consistency aligns with conservation principles. Expected outcomes: improved training stability, reduced数据需求 via inductive biases, and physically plausible predictions. Impact: Unifies geometric physics with ML, enabling trustworthy models for science and industry.
