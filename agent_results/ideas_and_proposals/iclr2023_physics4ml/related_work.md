1. **Title**: Deep Neural Networks with Symplectic Preservation Properties (arXiv:2407.00294)
   - **Authors**: Qing He, Wei Cai
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces a deep neural network architecture designed to ensure that its output forms an invertible symplectomorphism of the input. Drawing an analogy to the real-valued non-volume-preserving (real NVP) method used in normalizing flow techniques, the authors propose utilizing this neural network type to learn tasks on unknown Hamiltonian systems without breaking the inherent symplectic structure of the phase space.

   - **Authors**: Marco David, Florian Méhats
   - **Summary**: This work explores an improved training method for Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) by exploiting the symplectic structure of Hamiltonian systems with a different loss function. The authors mathematically guarantee the existence of an exact Hamiltonian function that the HNN can learn, allowing for error analysis and enhanced explainability. A novel post-training correction is also presented to obtain the true Hamiltonian from discretized observation data up to an arbitrary order.

   - **Summary**: This paper introduces the "symplectic gyroceptron," a structure-preserving neural network designed to approximate nearly-periodic symplectic maps. The architecture ensures that the surrogate map is nearly-periodic and symplectic, providing a discrete-time adiabatic invariant and long-term stability. This approach is particularly promising for surrogate modeling of non-dissipative dynamical systems.

The models identify the Poisson brackets and energy functionals from observation data, distinguishing between symplectic systems with non-degenerate Poisson brackets and non-symplectic systems with degenerate brackets. This approach does not assume prior information about the dynamics beyond its Hamiltonian nature.

**2. Key Challenges**

1. **Architectural Design for Symplectic Preservation**: Developing neural network architectures that inherently preserve symplectic structures is complex. Ensuring that the network's transformations are symplectic requires careful design and may involve constraints that complicate training and limit expressiveness.

2. **Training Stability and Efficiency**: Training symplectic neural networks can be challenging due to the need for specialized loss functions and integration schemes that preserve the symplectic structure. Ensuring numerical stability and efficient convergence during training remains a significant hurdle.

3. **Generalization to Non-Separable Systems**: While many approaches focus on separable Hamiltonian systems, extending these methods to non-separable systems, which are common in fields like fluid dynamics and quantum mechanics, presents additional challenges in modeling the coupled evolution of position and momentum.

4. **Data Efficiency and Small Sample Learning**: Achieving accurate modeling of Hamiltonian dynamics from limited data is difficult. Meta-learning approaches aim to address this by leveraging knowledge from multiple systems, but effectively capturing system-specific dynamics with small datasets remains a challenge.

5. **Integration of Physical Constraints and Symmetries**: Incorporating conservation laws and physical symmetries into neural network models is essential for reliability and generalizability. However, embedding these constraints without compromising the model's flexibility and performance is a delicate balance.
