**Research Proposal: Semantic Conformal Prediction Sets for Black-Box LLM Uncertainty**  

---

### 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across tasks, but their deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and legal advice remains fraught with risks due to overconfidence and hallucinations. Traditional statistical tools for uncertainty quantification assume access to model internals or parametric distributions, which are unavailable in black-box LLMs. Conformal prediction (CP) offers distribution-free uncertainty guarantees by constructing prediction sets that contain the true output with a user-specified probability. However, existing CP methods for LLMs often rely on token-level probabilities or heuristic confidence scores, which are unreliable in open-ended generation tasks. This gap necessitates a framework that leverages semantic properties of LLM outputs to ensure robust uncertainty quantification.  

**Research Objectives**  
This work addresses the challenge of reliable uncertainty estimation for black-box LLMs through three objectives:  
1. Develop a **semantic conformal prediction (SCP)** framework that maps LLM-generated outputs and human references into a shared embedding space to compute nonconformity scores.  
2. Provide **finite-sample coverage guarantees** for prediction sets, ensuring that the true response is included with probability \(1 - \alpha\).  
3. Extend SCP to **chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning** to audit intermediate reasoning steps and reduce hallucinations.  

**Significance**  
The proposed method enables safe LLM deployment in critical applications by offering statistical guarantees on output correctness. It advances the field by:  
- Introducing a semantic embedding-based approach to CP, improving alignment between uncertainty scores and output quality.  
- Reducing reliance on proprietary model internals, making it applicable to commercial LLM APIs.  
- Enabling real-time safety audits for complex reasoning processes via CoT extensions.

### 2. Methodology  

**Research Design**  

**Step 1: Data Collection**  
- **Calibration Data**: Collect \(n\) prompt-reference pairs \((x_i, y_i)\) from domain-specific datasets (e.g., medical Q&A, legal documents). Split into calibration (\(D_{\text{cal}}\)) and test (\(D_{\text{test}}\)) sets.  
- **Candidate Generation**: For each \(x_i \in D_{\text{cal}}\), generate \(k\) candidate responses \(\{c_{i,j}\}_{j=1}^k\) using the LLM.  

**Step 2: Semantic Embedding Model**  
- Use a pre-trained sentence encoder (e.g., Sentence-BERT) to embed prompts, candidates, and references into a shared space:  
  $$
  e_i = \text{Embed}(x_i), \quad r_i = \text{Embed}(y_i), \quad e_{i,j} = \text{Embed}(c_{i,j})
  $$  

**Step 3: Nonconformity Score Calculation**  
- Compute the cosine distance between each candidate and its reference:  
  $$
  S_{i,j} = 1 - \cos(r_i, e_{i,j})
  $$  
  Collect all scores \(\mathcal{S} = \{S_{i,j} \mid i=1,\dots,n, \, j=1,\dots,k\}\).  

**Step 4: Threshold Calibration**  
- Sort \(\mathcal{S}\) and compute the threshold \(\tau\) as the \((1-\alpha)(1 + \frac{1}{n})\)-quantile:  
  $$
  \tau = \text{Quantile}\left(\mathcal{S}, \lceil (1-\alpha)(1 + \frac{1}{n}) \cdot |\mathcal{S}| \rceil \right)
  $$  

**Step 5: Test-Time Prediction Set Construction**  
- For a new prompt \(x_{\text{test}}\), generate \(m\) candidates \(\{c_{\text{test},j}\}_{j=1}^m\).  
- Compute the minimum distance to calibration references for each candidate:  
  $$
  S_{\text{test},j} = \min_{r \in \{r_1, \dots, r_n\}} \left(1 - \cos(r, e_{\text{test},j})\right)
  $$  
- Include \(c_{\text{test},j}\) in the prediction set \(\mathcal{C}(x_{\text{test}})\) if \(S_{\text{test},j} \leq \tau\).  

**Step 6: Extension to Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**  
- For CoT tasks, split the generated answer into reasoning steps \(s_1, \dots, s_T\).  
- Compute nonconformity scores for each step \(s_t\) against a *verifier* model or reference rationale embeddings.  
- Aggregate scores to flag unsafe reasoning paths.  

**Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against vanilla CP (Vovk et al., 2005), ConU (Wang et al., 2024), and self-consistency sampling.  
- **Datasets**: MedQA (medical Q&A), LegalBench (legal advice), and TruthfulQA (hallucination detection).  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Coverage Rate**: Proportion of test examples where \(y_{\text{test}} \in \mathcal{C}(x_{\text{test}})\).  
  - **Precision**: Fraction of candidates in \(\mathcal{C}(x_{\text{test}})\) semantically equivalent to \(y_{\text{test}}\).  
  - **Set Size**: Average \(|\mathcal{C}(x_{\text{test}})|\) to measure efficiency.  
  - **Hallucination Rate**: Rate of nonsensical or incorrect outputs in \(\mathcal{C}(x_{\text{test}})\).

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Coverage Guarantees**: The method will achieve \(1-\alpha\) coverage on \(D_{\text{test}}\), outperforming baselines by 10–15% in high-distribution-shift scenarios.  
2. **Reduced Hallucinations**: Prediction sets will exclude 30–50% of incorrect outputs while retaining 80% of correct ones.  
3. **Scalability**: Linear time complexity relative to calibration set size, enabling real-time deployment.  

**Impact**  
- **Safety-Critical Applications**: Enable LLM use in healthcare diagnostics and legal document review with quantified uncertainty.  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Provide auditable uncertainty estimates for AI governance frameworks.  
- **Theoretical Advancements**: Bridge CP theory and semantic embedding spaces, inspiring new statistical tools for generative AI.
