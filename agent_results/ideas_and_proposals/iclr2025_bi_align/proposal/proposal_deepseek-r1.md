**Research Proposal: Dynamic Human-AI Co-Adaptation via Real-Time Feedback-Driven Alignment**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

#### **Background**  
Traditional AI alignment frameworks treat alignment as a static, one-way process where AI systems are trained offline using fixed human preferences. However, real-world human-AI interactions are dynamic: user preferences evolve, contextual conditions shift, and effective collaboration requires *bidirectional* adaptation. Current approaches, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or AI Feedback (RLAIF), face limitations in scalability, interpretability, and adaptability to non-stationary environments. For instance, while RL-SaLLM-F (Tu et al., 2024) leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment feedback for preference-based RL, it does not address real-time bidirectional alignment. Similarly, methods like KTO (Ethayarajh et al., 2024) optimize end-to-end alignment but lack mechanisms for continuous adaptation. This project addresses these gaps by proposing a framework that enables **dynamic co-adaptation between humans and AI systems through real-time feedback loops**, ensuring sustained alignment in evolving contexts.  

#### **Research Objectives**  
1. Develop a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning framework that adapts to real-time human feedback while preserving prior alignment objectives.  
2. Design interpretable feedback mechanisms to empower users to critically evaluate and shape AI behavior.  
3. Quantify longitudinal alignment persistence, adaptability, and user trust in dynamic task domains.  

#### **Significance**  
This research bridges the gap between AI-centered alignment (optimizing AI behavior) and human-centered alignment (preserving user agency). It advances the design of AI systems that dynamically adapt to evolving human needs while fostering transparency and collaboration. The outcomes will directly impact applications in healthcare (e.g., adaptive diagnostic tools), education (e.g., personalized tutoring systems), and ethical AI deployment by mitigating misalignment risks.

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### **Research Design**  
The proposed framework integrates online RL with multimodal human feedback and imitation learning. It consists of three components:  
1. **Real-Time Feedback Acquisition**: Collect explicit (language corrections, ratings) and implicit (behavioral cues, eye-tracking) feedback during interactions.  
2. **Hybrid Policy Learning**: Combine RL updates with imitation learning on historical data to balance adaptation and stability.  
3. **Interpretable Explanation Generation**: Use LLMs to provide real-time explanations of how feedback influences AI decisions.  

#### **Data Collection**  
- **Domains**: Two dynamic task environments:  
  - **Collaborative Robotics**: A robot manipulator assists users in assembly tasks with evolving constraints.  
  - **Personalized Recommendations**: A music recommendation system adapts to shifting user preferences.  
- **Feedback Channels**:  
  - Explicit: Natural language corrections (e.g., "Prioritize faster delivery over cost").  
  - Implicit: Behavioral signals (e.g., dwell time on explanations, task abandonment rates).  

#### **Algorithmic Framework**  
The AI agent’s policy $\pi_\theta$ is updated using a hybrid objective:  
$$L(\theta) = \lambda_1 L_{\text{RL}} + \lambda_2 L_{\text{IL}} + \lambda_3 R(\theta, \theta_{\text{prior}}),$$  
where:  
- $L_{\text{RL}}$: PPO-based RL loss (Schulman et al., 2017):  
  $$L_{\text{RL}} = \mathbb{E}_t\left[\min\left(r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t\right)\right],$$  
  with $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t|s_t)}$ and $\hat{A}_t$ as the advantage estimate.  
- $L_{\text{IL}}$: Imitation loss using behavioral cloning on high-reward historical trajectories.  
- $R(\theta, \theta_{\text{prior}})$: L2 regularization penalizing deviation from a frozen prior policy $\theta_{\text{prior}}$ to prevent catastrophic forgetting.  

#### **Interpretable Feedback Loops**  
Feedback is mapped to interpretable rules via an LLM-based module (e.g., GPT-4) that generates explanations like:  
*"Your request to prioritize affordability reduced the weight of brand preferences in recommendations by 20%."*  

#### **Experimental Validation**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against RLHF (OpenAI, 2025), RLAIF (Lee et al., 2023), and static imitation learning.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - *Alignment Persistence*: Task success rate over 10+ interaction sessions.  
  - *Adaptability*: Time to converge to new user preferences (measured via KL divergence between policy updates).  
  - *User Trust*: Pre-/post-study surveys (Likert scales) and implicit metrics (e.g., frequency of manual overrides).  
  - *Explanation Quality*: BLEU score and semantic similarity between generated explanations and ground-truth rationales.  
- **Longitudinal Studies**: Deploy the framework in a 6-week user study with 50 participants across both task domains.

1. **Technical Contributions**:  
   - A novel hybrid RL-imitation learning algorithm that achieves a **15–20% improvement in alignment persistence** over RLHF baselines.  
   - A benchmark dataset for dynamic human-AI co-adaptation, including multimodal feedback from collaborative tasks.  

2. **Human-Centered Impact**:  
   - **30% increase in user trust** due to interpretable explanations, validated through longitudinal surveys.  
   - Guidelines for designing bidirectional alignment systems in high-stakes domains (e.g., healthcare).  

3. **Societal Benefits**:  
   - Mitigation of misalignment risks in AI deployment through scalable, context-aware frameworks.  
   - Promotion of inclusive AI ecosystems by empowering non-expert users to shape AI behavior.  

This work will establish a foundation for resilient human-AI collaboration, advancing the workshop’s goal of fostering interdisciplinary innovation in bidirectional alignment research.
