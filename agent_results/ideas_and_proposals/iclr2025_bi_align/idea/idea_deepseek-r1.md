**Title:** Co-Adaptive Alignment: Integrating Dynamic Feedback and Explainable Guidance for Bidirectional Human-AI Synergy  

**Motivation:** Current alignment methods (e.g., RLHF) primarily focus on training AI to adapt to humans, neglecting human adaptation to AI behavior. This imbalance risks user over-reliance or distrust, especially as AI systems evolve. A bidirectional approach is needed to foster mutual understanding, enabling AI to learn from humans while empowering users to comprehend and critically engage with AI decisions.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a co-adaptive framework where AI systems dynamically adjust to human feedback *and* provide contextual, real-time explanations tailored to usersâ€™ comprehension levels. The AI employs reinforcement learning with iterative human feedback, while a parallel module generates adaptive explanations (e.g., saliency maps, counterfactuals) based on user interaction patterns (e.g., confusion signals, query rates). User understanding is tracked via periodic micro-assessments and feedback loops, informing both explanation simplicity and RLHF reward models. For evaluation, introduce dual metrics: (1) *AI alignment accuracy* (task-performance benchmarks) and (2) *human alignment maturity* (user accuracy in predicting AI behavior, trust scales). This integrates NLP for explanation generation, HCI for intuitive interfaces, and ML for adaptive learning. Potential impacts include safer human-AI collaboration in healthcare diagnosis or educational tutoring, where mutual adaptation improves outcomes and accountability.
