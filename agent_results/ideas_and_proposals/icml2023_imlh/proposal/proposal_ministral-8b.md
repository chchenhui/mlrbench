# Knowledge-Infused Graph Networks for Interpretable and Uncertainty-Aware Diagnosis

## 1. Introduction
The application of machine learning (ML) in healthcare is rapidly growing, but the black-box nature of traditional ML models hinders their adoption in clinical settings. The lack of interpretability and verifiability in making clinical predictions raises concerns about safety, security, and trustworthiness. To address these challenges, there is a pressing need to develop methodologies that enhance the interpretability of medical intelligence. This research proposal aims to develop a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that integrates medical knowledge graphs to provide interpretable and uncertainty-aware diagnostic predictions. By grounding predictions in established medical knowledge and quantifying uncertainty, this approach seeks to build trustworthy diagnostic tools that align with clinical reasoning.

### Research Objectives
1. Develop a GNN framework that integrates a medical knowledge graph to enhance interpretability.
2. Implement an attention mechanism to identify salient medical concepts driving diagnosis predictions.
3. Employ evidential deep learning or conformal prediction methods within the GNN framework to quantify diagnostic uncertainty.
4. Validate the model's performance and interpretability through extensive clinical testing and evaluation.

### Significance
The proposed research has significant implications for the healthcare domain. By providing evidence-based explanations and reliable confidence scores, the framework aims to facilitate safer clinical integration of AI-driven diagnostic tools. The ability to identify and quantify uncertainty will help clinicians make more informed decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing the risk of misdiagnosis.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Research Design

The proposed research involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Collect electronic health records (EHR), imaging features, and other relevant medical data.
   - Preprocess the data to map patient information onto a medical knowledge graph structure.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - Construct a medical knowledge graph (MKG) that links symptoms, diseases, tests, genes, and other relevant medical entities.
   - Ensure the MKG is comprehensive and up-to-date, incorporating the latest medical knowledge.

3. **Model Architecture:**
   - Develop a GNN framework that takes patient data as input and maps it onto the MKG.
   - Utilize attention mechanisms to identify the most salient medical concepts and relationships driving diagnosis predictions.
   - Integrate evidential deep learning or conformal prediction methods within the GNN framework to quantify diagnostic uncertainty.

4. **Training and Validation:**
   - Train the GNN model on a diverse dataset of medical cases.
   - Validate the model's performance and interpretability using clinical benchmarks and evaluation metrics.

5. **Clinical Testing:**
   - Conduct extensive clinical testing to evaluate the model's performance in real-world scenarios.
   - Gather feedback from clinicians to refine the model and ensure it aligns with clinical reasoning.

### 2.2 Algorithmic Steps

#### 2.2.1 Graph Construction
The medical knowledge graph (MKG) is constructed by linking medical entities such as symptoms, diseases, tests, and genes. The graph structure is represented as an adjacency matrix \( A \), where each element \( a_{ij} \) indicates the presence of a relationship between entities \( i \) and \( j \).

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \cdots & a_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

#### 2.2.2 GNN Framework
The GNN framework incorporates attention mechanisms to learn representations from the MKG. The framework can be described as follows:

1. **Input Layer:**
   - Patient data is mapped onto the MKG structure, creating a node feature matrix \( X \).

2. **Graph Convolutional Layer:**
   - The GNN applies graph convolution operations to aggregate information from neighboring nodes.

\[
H^{(l)} = \sigma \left( \tilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}} \tilde{A} \tilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}} H^{(l-1)} W^{(l)} \right)
\]

where \( H^{(l)} \) is the output of the \( l \)-th layer, \( \tilde{A} = I + A \), \( \tilde{D} \) is the degree matrix, and \( W^{(l)} \) is the weight matrix.

3. **Attention Mechanism:**
   - An attention mechanism is applied to identify the most salient medical concepts and relationships.

\[
\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp(e_{ij})}{\sum_{k} \exp(e_{ik})}
\]

where \( e_{ij} \) is the attention score between nodes \( i \) and \( j \).

4. **Evidential Deep Learning/Conformal Prediction:**
   - The GNN framework integrates evidential deep learning or conformal prediction methods to quantify diagnostic uncertainty.

\[
P(y|x) = \sum_{y'} P(y'|x) \cdot P(y' \mid y)
\]

where \( P(y'|x) \) is the predicted probability of class \( y' \) given input \( x \), and \( P(y' \mid y) \) is the conditional probability of \( y' \) given \( y \).

#### 2.2.3 Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance and interpretability will be evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision and Recall:** Measures of the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases.
- **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC):** Measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases.
- **Uncertainty Quantification Metrics:** Measures such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) will be used to quantify the model's uncertainty.

### 2.3 Experimental Design

#### 2.3.1 Dataset
The dataset will consist of a diverse collection of medical cases, including EHR, imaging features, and other relevant medical data. The dataset will be split into training, validation, and test sets.

#### 2.3.2 Model Training
The GNN model will be trained using a combination of supervised learning and unsupervised learning techniques. The model will be optimized using gradient descent-based optimization algorithms.

#### 2.3.3 Model Validation
The model's performance will be validated using clinical benchmarks and evaluation metrics. The model's interpretability will be evaluated through visualization techniques, such as attention maps and graph visualizations.

#### 2.3.4 Clinical Testing
The model will undergo extensive clinical testing to evaluate its performance in real-world scenarios. Feedback from clinicians will be used to refine the model and ensure it aligns with clinical reasoning.
