1. **Title**: Uncertainty Quantification over Graph with Conformalized Graph Neural Networks (arXiv:2305.14535)
   - **Authors**: Kexin Huang, Ying Jin, Emmanuel Cand√®s, Jure Leskovec
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces conformalized Graph Neural Networks (CF-GNN), extending conformal prediction to GNNs for rigorous uncertainty estimates. CF-GNN produces prediction sets/intervals that contain the true label with a predefined coverage probability, addressing the lack of uncertainty quantification in GNNs. The authors establish a permutation invariance condition for validity on graph data and develop a topology-aware output correction model to enhance prediction efficiency.

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Integration of Medical Knowledge into GNNs**: Effectively embedding complex and diverse medical knowledge into GNN architectures remains challenging, requiring sophisticated methods to ensure accurate and meaningful representations.

2. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Developing reliable methods for quantifying both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in GNN predictions is crucial for clinical trust but remains an open problem.

3. **Interpretability and Explainability**: Ensuring that GNN-based diagnostic models provide explanations that align with clinical reasoning is essential for adoption but is difficult due to the complexity of both the models and medical data.

4. **Handling Noisy and Incomplete Data**: Medical datasets often contain noise and missing information, posing significant challenges for GNNs in learning accurate and robust representations.

5. **Clinical Validation and Deployment**: Translating GNN models from research to clinical practice requires extensive validation to meet regulatory standards and gain clinician trust, which is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process.
