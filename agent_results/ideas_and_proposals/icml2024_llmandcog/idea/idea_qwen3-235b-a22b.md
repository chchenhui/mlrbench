1. **Title**: Bridging Cognition and Mechanistic Interpretability: A Neuroscience-Inspired Framework for Analyzing LLMs  

2. **Motivation**: Despite LLMs exhibiting human-like cognitive abilities, their decision-making mechanisms remain poorly understood compared to biological systems. Bridging mechanistic interpretability methods from AI and neuroscience can reveal parallels/divergences between model and human cognition, addressing the workshop's goal of situating LLMs in the intelligence landscape. This is critical for diagnosing architectural limitations and enhancing trust in AI systems.  

3. **Main Idea**: Propose a unified framework that adapts neuropsychological techniques (e.g., lesion studies, functional connectivity analysis) and applies them to LLMs. For instance, systematically ablating attention heads or MLP layers during cognitive tasks (e.g., reasoning, theory of mind) could identify components critical to specific abilities. Parallel fMRI studies in humans performing analogous tasks would map neural correlates to LLM mechanisms. Key metrics include task performance degradation in models and activation patterns in humans. Expected outcomes include a taxonomy of model components aligned with cognitive functions (e.g., attention heads as working memory analogs) and evidence of whether LLMs recapitulate or diverge from neurological pathways. This cross-disciplinary approach could guide LLM design to overcome biological limitations (e.g., energy efficiency) while avoiding architectural pitfalls. The impact lies in rigorous benchmarks for cognition and actionable insights for building more human-aligned AI.
