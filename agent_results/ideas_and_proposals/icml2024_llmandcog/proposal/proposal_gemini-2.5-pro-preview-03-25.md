## 1. Title: Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB): A Framework for Assessing the Emergence and Progression of Planning and Theory-of-Mind Capabilities in Large Language Models

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Background
Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant leap in artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable proficiency across diverse linguistic tasks and exhibiting emergent capabilities that often surprise their creators (Wei et al., 2022). These emergent abilities, particularly those hinting at higher-level cognition such as reasoning, planning, and social understanding (Theory of Mind - ToM), have positioned LLMs at the forefront of discussions about artificial general intelligence (Bubeck et al., 2023). The Workshop on LLMs and Cognition specifically aims to dissect these cognitive parallels and divergences between LLMs and biological intelligence, questioning the depth, robustness, and limitations of LLM cognitive abilities.

However, evaluating these sophisticated cognitive functions presents a major challenge. Current benchmark methodologies predominantly rely on static datasets (e.g., BIG-bench; Srivastava et al., 2022). While valuable, these benchmarks typically assess performance at fixed difficulty levels, offering limited insight into how cognitive abilities *develop* or *emerge* within a model as task complexity increases. They struggle to capture the learning dynamics or pinpoint the thresholds at which capabilities like multi-step planning or nuanced ToM reasoning become apparent. This limitation hinders our understanding of LLM cognitive scaling laws and makes fair comparisons between different models or architectural approaches (e.g., end-to-end fine-tuned vs. modular LLMs augmented with external tools) difficult. As highlighted in the literature, challenges persist in adaptive benchmarking, identifying emergence points, managing long-horizon contexts, mitigating hallucinations, and integrating reliable human validation (Cross et al., 2024; Lv et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023).

### 2.2 Problem Statement
The core problem addressed by this research is the inadequacy of existing static evaluation frameworks to comprehensively assess and understand the *emergence* and *progression* of complex cognitive abilities, specifically planning and Theory of Mind (ToM), in LLMs. Static benchmarks provide snapshots of performance but fail to dynamically adapt task difficulty to individual model capabilities, making it hard to:
1.  Identify the precise conditions or complexity thresholds under which specific cognitive abilities (e.g., multi-step planning, second-order ToM) emerge.
2.  Characterize the learning or performance trajectory of an LLM as it encounters increasingly challenging cognitive tasks.
3.  Conduct fine-grained comparative analyses of different LLMs or architectural paradigms (e.g., monolithic vs. modular) based on their cognitive development potential.
4.  Address the limitations of LLMs in long-horizon reasoning and potential hallucinations within a controlled, progressively complex environment.

### 2.3 Proposed Solution: Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB)
To overcome these limitations, we propose the **Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB)**. DCB is an adaptive evaluation framework designed to algorithmically generate sequences of tasks within specific cognitive domains (planning, navigation, ToM) where the difficulty dynamically scales based on the LLM's real-time performance. Utilizing reinforcement learning (RL)-based task sampling mechanisms, DCB will create personalized curricula for each evaluated LLM, starting from simple problems and progressively increasing complexity. This adaptive nature allows for the mapping of performance trajectories and the identification of potential emergence points for different cognitive skills. Furthermore, DCB incorporates human-in-the-loop (HITL) validation to ensure the robustness of automated scoring and handle nuanced or edge-case behaviors.

### 2.4 Research Objectives
The primary objectives of this research are:
1.  **Develop the DCB Framework:** Design and implement the core components of the DCB, including the task generation modules for planning, navigation, and ToM, the performance monitoring system, and the adaptive difficulty scaling mechanism.
2.  **Implement RL-based Task Samplers:** Develop and integrate reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Multi-Armed Bandits or simple policy gradients) to dynamically select appropriate task difficulty levels based on LLM performance history.
3.  **Generate Dynamic Task Curricula:** Utilize the DCB framework to generate adaptive task sequences for a diverse set of LLMs.
4.  **Evaluate LLM Cognitive Trajectories:** Apply the DCB to various state-of-the-art LLMs (including base models, instruction-tuned models, and potentially modular architectures) to map their performance curves across increasing task complexity in planning and ToM domains.
5.  **Identify Emergence Thresholds:** Analyze the performance trajectories to estimate the complexity levels at which specific cognitive abilities appear to emerge robustly in different models.
6.  **Compare Model Architectures:** Use DCB to conduct comparative studies between LLMs fine-tuned end-to-end versus LLMs augmented with external memory or reasoning modules (akin to Cross et al., 2024).
7.  **Validate with Human-in-the-Loop:** Integrate a HITL process to verify automated scoring accuracy, assess the quality of generated tasks, and analyze complex or ambiguous LLM responses.

### 2.5 Significance
This research holds significant potential contributions:
*   **Methodological Advancement:** DCB offers a novel, adaptive approach to benchmarking cognitive abilities in AI, moving beyond static evaluations.
*   **Understanding Emergence:** It provides a systematic methodology to study how and when complex cognitive skills emerge in LLMs as a function of task complexity, contributing empirically to the debate on emergent abilities.
*   **Fairer Model Comparison:** DCB enables more nuanced comparisons between different LLMs and architectures by evaluating their performance across a dynamic range of difficulties, rather than at arbitrary fixed points.
*   **Informing Future Development:** Insights gained from DCB can guide the design of future LLMs and training strategies aimed at fostering more robust higher-order reasoning and social cognition.
*   **Bridging AI and Cognitive Science:** By operationalizing cognitive concepts like planning depth and ToM levels within a computational framework, this research contributes to the interdisciplinary dialogue fostered by the Workshop on LLMs and Cognition.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Overall Research Design
The research will follow an iterative development and evaluation process:
1.  **Framework Design:** Define the architecture of DCB, including task domains, parameterization of difficulty, RL sampler specifications, and HITL integration points.
2.  **Implementation:** Develop the software components: task generators, LLM interaction interface, performance trackers, RL agents, and the HITL interface.
3.  **Pilot Testing:** Conduct initial tests with a small set of LLMs and tasks to refine the difficulty scaling and RL parameters.
4.  **Large-Scale Evaluation:** Run comprehensive experiments using DCB on a diverse range of LLMs.
5.  **Analysis & Interpretation:** Analyze the collected performance data, identify emergence thresholds, compare models, and synthesize findings.
6.  **Refinement:** Iteratively improve the DCB framework based on experimental results and HITL feedback.

### 3.2 Task Generation and Domains
DCB will focus on three core cognitive domains relevant to the workshop themes:

1.  **Planning:** Tasks will involve generating a sequence of actions to achieve a goal in a defined environment. Difficulty will be parameterized by:
    *   *Plan Length:* Number of steps required (e.g., 2-step vs. 10-step).
    *   *State Space Size:* Number of objects, locations, or possible actions.
    *   *Constraints:* Presence of obstacles, resource limitations, or specific action sequences.
    *   *Goal Complexity:* Simple goal state vs. conjunctive goals or goals requiring intermediate states.
    *   *Example:* Generating instructions to navigate a grid world, solving logic puzzles like Tower of Hanoi, or devising a plan to prepare a meal with given ingredients and constraints. Tasks will be generated algorithmically or adapted from existing planning datasets (e.g., PDDL domains).

2.  **Navigation:** Primarily text-based scenarios requiring spatial reasoning and planning. Difficulty parameters include:
    *   *Environment Size/Complexity:* Simple room descriptions vs. complex multi-room buildings or outdoor areas.
    *   *Ambiguity:* Precise instructions vs. vague directions requiring inference.
    *   *Dynamic Elements:* Presence of moving obstacles or changing environmental states (optional, advanced).
    *   *Reference Frames:* Egocentric vs. allocentric descriptions.
    *   *Example:* Following directions in a text-based adventure game, describing a route between landmarks based on a textual map, or planning movement in a simulated environment described textually.

3.  **Theory of Mind (ToM):** Tasks assessing the ability to attribute mental states (beliefs, desires, intentions) to oneself and others. Difficulty parameters:
    *   *Order of ToM:* First-order (X believes Y) vs. second-order (X believes Y believes Z).
    *   *False Belief:* Standard false-belief tasks (e.g., Sally-Anne) vs. more complex scenarios.
    *   *Context Complexity:* Simple stories vs. multi-agent interactions with conflicting information or deception.
    *   *Number of Agents:* Reasoning about one other agent vs. multiple agents with different mental states.
    *   *Implicit vs. Explicit Cues:* Inferring mental states from subtle behavioral cues vs. explicit statements.
    *   *Example:* Predicting a character's action based on their mistaken belief, explaining a character's motivation in a social scenario, acting optimally in a cooperative/competitive game requiring prediction of other players' intentions (inspired by Li et al., 2023; Cross et al., 2024). Tasks can be generated synthetically based on ToM templates or adapted from psychology/cognitive science literature and text-based game environments.

Task generation will be primarily procedural, allowing fine-grained control over difficulty parameters defined above.

### 3.3 Algorithmic Steps of DCB Execution

For a given LLM ($M$) and cognitive domain ($D$), the DCB operates as follows:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Select domain $D$ (Planning, Navigation, or ToM).
    *   Initialize the difficulty level $d$ to the lowest setting ($d_{min}$).
    *   Initialize the LLM's performance history $H_D = \emptyset$.
    *   Initialize the RL-based task sampler $A_D$. A Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) approach seems suitable initially, where each arm corresponds to a discrete difficulty level $d_i$. The state could simply be the recent performance history, and the reward could be based on achieving successful task completion or maintaining a target success rate.

2.  **Task Sampling and Presentation:**
    *   The RL sampler $A_D$, based on $H_D$, selects the next difficulty level $d_{next}$. This selection aims to balance exploration (trying harder tasks) and exploitation (staying at a level where the model performs reasonably well to get stable estimates).
    *   A task $T$ is generated or selected with difficulty parameters corresponding to $d_{next}$.
    *   Task $T$ is presented to the LLM $M$ via a standardized prompt format. Example prompt structure:
        ```
        [Domain Context: e.g., Planning Puzzle]
        [Environment/Scenario Description]
        [Goal/Question]
        Please provide the [Plan/Action/Prediction]:
        ```

3.  **LLM Interaction and Response Collection:**
    *   The LLM $M$ processes the prompt and generates a response $R$.
    *   Response $R$ is captured.

4.  **Performance Evaluation (Automated):**
    *   An automated scoring function $Eval(T, R)$ assesses the correctness or quality of the response. This could involve:
        *   Exact match (for simple answers).
        *   Keyword extraction and checking (for plans or specific predictions).
        *   Code execution (if the response is a plan executable in a simulator).
        *   Semantic similarity comparison against a ground truth solution.
        *   Using another powerful LLM as a judge (with careful calibration).
    *   The outcome $o = Eval(T, R)$ (e.g., $o \in \{ \text{Success}, \text{Failure} \}$ or a continuous score) is recorded.

5.  **History and RL Update:**
    *   The tuple $(T, d_{next}, R, o)$ is added to the history $H_D$.
    *   The RL sampler $A_D$ is updated based on the outcome $o$. For an MAB like UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) or Thompson Sampling:
        *   Update the estimated reward (e.g., success rate) for the chosen difficulty arm $d_{next}$.
        *   Update any confidence bounds or sampling distributions.
        Let $S_i$ be the success rate observed at difficulty $d_i$. The reward $r$ for attempting a task at $d_i$ could be $r=1$ if successful, $r=0$ otherwise. The MAB aims to learn the probability of success $P(\text{Success} | d_i, M)$. A simple update for the estimated success rate $\hat{S}_i$ after $n_i$ attempts with $k_i$ successes is $\hat{S}_i = k_i / n_i$. The sampler then chooses the next difficulty level $d_{next}$ to maximize a criterion, e.g., for UCB:
        $$ d_{next} = \arg\max_{d_i} \left( \hat{S}_i + c \sqrt{\frac{\log N}{n_i}} \right) $$
        where $N$ is the total number of tasks attempted so far, $n_i$ is the number of attempts at difficulty $d_i$, and $c$ is an exploration parameter.

6.  **Iteration:** Repeat steps 2-5 for a predetermined number of iterations or until performance stabilizes across difficulty levels.

7.  **Emergence Point Estimation:** After the evaluation run, analyze the performance trajectory $P(d | M, D)$ (probability of success as a function of difficulty $d$). An emergence threshold $d^*_{emergence}$ for a skill within domain $D$ for model $M$ can be defined as the minimum difficulty level $d$ where the success rate consistently exceeds a predefined threshold $\theta$ (e.g., $\theta = 0.8$).
    $$ d^*_{emergence}(M, D) = \min \{ d \mid P(\text{Success} | d', M, D) \ge \theta \text{ for } d' \ge d \} $$

### 3.4 Experimental Design

1.  **LLMs Selection:** We will select a diverse range of publicly available and potentially proprietary LLMs, including:
    *   Different model families (e.g., GPT variants, Llama variants, Claude variants, Gemini variants).
    *   Different model sizes within families (e.g., Llama-3 8B vs. 70B).
    *   Base pre-trained models vs. instruction-finetuned models.
    *   Models specifically fine-tuned for planning or reasoning tasks (if available).
    *   Comparative Systems: Implement or adapt modular architectures (as in Cross et al., 2024) combining an LLM with external symbolic planners or belief trackers to compare against monolithic LLMs within DCB.

2.  **Baselines:**
    *   *Static Benchmark Comparison:* Evaluate selected LLMs on existing static benchmarks for planning and ToM (e.g., sections of BIG-bench, ToM-bench) and compare the coarse-grained results with the fine-grained trajectories from DCB.
    *   *Inter-LLM Comparison:* Use DCB results to rank and compare the selected LLMs based on their performance trajectories and estimated emergence thresholds.
    *   *Architectural Comparison:* Directly compare the performance trajectories of monolithic LLMs vs. augmented/modular LLM systems on the same DCB curricula.

3.  **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Integration:**
    *   A subset of LLM responses, particularly those near the estimated emergence thresholds or flagged as ambiguous by the automated scorer, will be presented to human evaluators.
    *   HITL tasks:
        *   Validate automated scores (True/False Positive/Negative).
        *   Provide qualitative assessments of response quality (e.g., coherence, correctness, hallucination detection).
        *   Verify the appropriateness and clarity of generated tasks at different difficulty levels.
    *   Implementation: A web-based interface will be developed for efficient annotation. We will employ multiple annotators per task and measure inter-annotator agreement.

### 3.5 Evaluation Metrics

1.  **LLM Performance Metrics:**
    *   *Success Rate vs. Difficulty:* The primary output curve $P(\text{Success} | d, M, D)$.
    *   *Emergence Threshold ($d^*_{emergence}$):* Estimated difficulty level for robust skill acquisition.
    *   *Area Under the Curve (AUC):* Integrated performance across the difficulty spectrum.
    *   *Qualitative Score (from HITL):* Human judgment on response quality, reasoning validity, and hallucination presence.
    *   *Efficiency Metrics (Optional):* Response latency, number of tokens generated.

2.  **DCB Framework Metrics:**
    *   *Sampler Efficiency:* Convergence speed of the RL sampler.
    *   *Correlation:* Correlation between DCB difficulty levels and human-perceived task difficulty.
    *   *HITL Agreement:* Inter-annotator agreement scores for validation tasks.

3.  **Comparative Metrics:**
    *   Rankings of LLMs based on $d^*_{emergence}$ and AUC.
    *   Statistical significance of performance differences between models and architectures at various difficulty levels.
