# Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark for Emergent Planning and Theory-of-Mind in LLMs

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, including machine translation, standardized tests, and conversational chatbots. However, their performance on complex cognitive tasks such as multi-step planning and Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning remains a subject of ongoing research. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate LLMs on static tasks, which fail to capture the dynamic progression of these cognitive abilities. This research aims to address this gap by proposing a "Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark" (DCB) that algorithmically generates sequences of tasks, scaling difficulty based on an LLM's previous performance. This benchmark will enable a more nuanced understanding of LLMs' cognitive capabilities and facilitate comparisons between different model architectures.

### Research Objectives

1. **Develop a Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB)**: Create an adaptive evaluation framework that generates sequences of tasks in planning, navigation, and ToM reasoning, scaling difficulty based on an LLM's performance.

2. **Identify Emergence Thresholds**: Determine the points at which LLMs exhibit advanced cognitive abilities such as multi-step planning and ToM reasoning.

3. **Compare Model Architectures**: Evaluate the performance of fine-tuned LLMs versus augmented LLMs coupled with external modules.

4. **Integrate Human-in-the-Loop Audits**: Validate automatic scoring and edge-case behaviors through human oversight.

### Significance

The proposed DCB will provide a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' cognitive capabilities, enabling researchers to understand the emergence thresholds of advanced reasoning skills. This research aims to bridge the gap between static benchmarks and dynamic evaluation frameworks, offering a more accurate assessment of LLMs' cognitive abilities. Additionally, the findings will contribute to the development of more robust and adaptable models capable of handling complex cognitive tasks.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The DCB will consist of four main components: task generation, performance monitoring, task progression, and human-in-the-loop validation.

#### Task Generation

The task generation module will use reinforcement-learning-based task samplers to create sequences of tasks. The initial tasks will be simple 2-step planning puzzles or first-person navigation prompts. The difficulty of subsequent tasks will increase based on the LLM's performance on previous tasks.

1. **Initial Task Selection**: Start with simple tasks such as:
   - 2-step planning puzzles (e.g., "If you want to bake a cake, what should you do first?")
   - First-person navigation prompts (e.g., "Navigate through a maze to reach the exit.")

2. **Task Difficulty Scaling**: Use a reinforcement-learning algorithm to determine the difficulty of the next task based on the LLM's performance on the previous task.

#### Performance Monitoring

The performance monitoring module will track the LLM's success rates and record performance trajectories. This data will be used to estimate the emergence points for each cognitive skill.

1. **Success Rate Calculation**: Calculate the LLM's success rate for each task based on the number of correct responses.

2. **Performance Trajectory Analysis**: Analyze the LLM's performance trajectories to identify trends and emergence points for each cognitive skill.

#### Task Progression

The task progression module will unlock more complex multiagent scenarios based on the LLM's performance. For example, if the LLM successfully completes a series of simple planning tasks, it will be presented with multiagent scenarios requiring ToM reasoning.

1. **Multiagent Scenarios**: Introduce multiagent scenarios such as predicting another agent's beliefs in a story world. For example:
   - "Agent A believes that Agent B will choose option X. Will Agent B choose option X?"
   - "Agent A is trying to complete a task. What does Agent B think Agent A will do next?"

2. **Task Complexity**: Gradually increase the complexity of the tasks based on the LLM's performance on previous tasks.

#### Human-in-the-Loop Validation

The human-in-the-loop validation module will integrate human auditors to validate automatic scoring and edge-case behaviors. This will ensure the accuracy and reliability of the DCB.

1. **Human Auditor Integration**: Collaborate with human auditors to validate the automatic scoring of the LLM's responses.

2. **Edge-Case Analysis**: Analyze edge-case behaviors where the LLM's responses deviate from expected outcomes. This will help identify potential biases or limitations in the DCB.

### Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness of the DCB, the following metrics will be used:

1. **Success Rate**: The percentage of tasks that the LLM completes correctly.

2. **Emergence Threshold**: The point at which the LLM exhibits advanced cognitive abilities.

3. **Human Auditor Agreement**: The level of agreement between human auditors and the automatic scoring system.

4. **Task Complexity**: The difficulty level of the tasks presented to the LLM.

### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the task generation module with a set of simple tasks.
   - Initialize the performance monitoring module to track success rates and performance trajectories.
   - Initialize the task progression module to start with simple tasks.

2. **Task Generation**:
   - Select the next task based on the LLM's performance on previous tasks.
   - Use a reinforcement-learning algorithm to determine the difficulty of the next task.

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Record the LLM's success rate for each task.
   - Analyze the performance trajectories to estimate emergence points for each cognitive skill.

4. **Task Progression**:
   - Unlock more complex multiagent scenarios based on the LLM's performance on previous tasks.
   - Gradually increase the complexity of the tasks.

5. **Human-in-the-Loop Validation**:
   - Collaborate with human auditors to validate the automatic scoring of the LLM's responses.
   - Analyze edge-case behaviors to identify potential biases or limitations in the DCB.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

The Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB) is expected to yield several significant outcomes and impacts:

1. **Fine-Grained Cognitive Profiles**: The DCB will provide detailed cognitive profiles for LLMs, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in various cognitive tasks.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: The DCB will enable a clearer comparison between fine-tuned LLMs and augmented LLMs coupled with external modules, shedding light on the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

3. **Actionable Insights**: The findings will offer actionable insights for designing models that robustly acquire higher-order reasoning and social cognition.

4. **Improved Benchmarks**: The DCB will contribute to the development of more accurate and adaptive benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' cognitive abilities.

5. **Enhanced Model Interpretability**: The DCB will facilitate a better understanding of how LLMs process and generate responses, improving model interpretability.

6. **Broader Impact**: The research will have broader implications for the development of intelligent systems, contributing to the advancement of AI and cognitive science.

By addressing the limitations of existing benchmarks and providing a more dynamic evaluation framework, the DCB will advance our understanding of LLMs' cognitive capabilities and pave the way for the development of more sophisticated and adaptable models.
