### 1. **Title**  
**Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark for Emergent Planning and Theory-of-Mind in Large Language Models**

### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks requiring reasoning, planning, and social cognition. However, their emergent cognitive abilities—such as multi-step planning and Theory of Mind (ToM)—remain poorly understood. Current benchmarks for evaluating these skills are static, failing to capture how LLMs adapt to progressively complex scenarios. This limitation obscures critical insights into the emergence thresholds of cognitive abilities and hinders fair comparisons between model architectures.  

**Research Objectives**  
This study aims to:  
1. Develop a **Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB)** that algorithmically generates adaptive task sequences to evaluate LLMs’ emergent planning and ToM abilities.  
2. Quantify performance trajectories to identify thresholds where cognitive skills emerge.  
3. Compare fine-tuned LLMs with modular architectures augmented by external reasoning components.  
4. Establish validated metrics for assessing LLM cognition through human-AI collaboration.  

**Significance**  
The DCB framework will provide a systematic way to:  
- Map LLMs’ cognitive profiles across difficulty gradients.  
- Inform model design by identifying architectural strengths/weaknesses.  
- Advance benchmarking practices for emergent AI capabilities.  
This work bridges gaps in AI evaluation and cognitive science, offering tools to rigorously assess LLMs as evolving intelligent systems.

### 3. **Methodology**  
**Research Design**  
The DCB framework integrates adaptive task generation, performance monitoring, and human validation. Below is the detailed workflow:  

#### **3.1 Data Collection & Task Generation**  
- **Task Taxonomy**: Define cognitive tasks across three domains:  
  - **Planning**: Multi-step puzzles (e.g., Tower of Hanoi variants).  
  - **Navigation**: Text-based environments requiring spatial reasoning.  
  - **Theory of Mind**: Multi-agent scenarios with belief/intent inference.  
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Use procedural algorithms to create tasks with adjustable complexity parameters (e.g., number of steps, agents, or environmental constraints).  

#### **3.2 Dynamic Curriculum Algorithm**  
A reinforcement learning (RL)-based task sampler adjusts difficulty based on LLM performance.  

**Algorithmic Steps**:  
1. **State Representation**: Encode the LLM’s recent performance history as a state vector $s_t = (p_{t-k}, p_{t-k+1}, \dots, p_t)$, where $p_i$ is the success rate at step $i$.  
2. **Action Space**: Task difficulty levels $a \in \{1, 2, \dots, N\}$, where higher levels introduce more steps, agents, or ambiguity.  
3. **Reward Function**:  
   $$ r(s_t, a_t) = \begin{cases} 
   1 & \text{if LLM succeeds at } a_t \\
   -1 & \text{if LLM fails} \\
   0.5 & \text{if partial success (validated by human audit)}
   \end{cases} $$  
4. **Policy Optimization**: Train a contextual bandit model to maximize cumulative reward:  
   $$ \pi^*(a|s) = \arg\max_\pi \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t r(s_t, a_t)\right] $$  
   where $\gamma$ is a discount factor.  

**Curriculum Progression**:  
- Start with 2-step planning or single-agent navigation.  
- After 3 consecutive successes, advance difficulty; after 3 failures, reduce it.  
- For ToM tasks, introduce multi-agent interactions (e.g., “Agent A believes Agent B does not know X”).  

#### **3.3 Experimental Design**  
**Models Tested**:  
- **Base LLMs**: GPT-4, Claude-3, Llama-3-70B.  
- **Fine-Tuned Variants**: Models further trained on planning/ToM datasets.  
- **Modular Architectures**: LLMs augmented with external planners (e.g., Hypothetical Minds’ hierarchical planner).  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
1. **Success Rate (SR)**: Percentage of tasks solved correctly.  
2. **Curriculum Progression Speed (CPS)**: Steps required to reach maximum difficulty.  
3. **Consistency Score (CS)**: Variance in performance across task categories.  
4. **Human-AI Agreement (HAA)**: Cohen’s $\kappa$ between automatic and human scoring.  

**Validation Protocol**:  
- **Human Audits**: Experts review 10% of responses, focusing on edge cases (e.g., partial successes).  
- **Inter-Rater Reliability**: Calculate Fleiss’ $\kappa$ across 3 annotators to ensure consistency.  

#### **3.4 Implementation Details**  
- **Task Interface**: OpenAI Gym-like environment for text-based interaction.  
- **Probing Hidden States**: For models like GPT-4, use linear probes to analyze if hidden activations encode future planning steps (as in Emergent Response Planning).  
- **Computational Infrastructure**: Run experiments on AWS EC2 instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**:  
1. **Cognitive Profiles**: Heatmaps showing LLMs’ performance across planning, navigation, and ToM tasks at varying difficulty levels (e.g., GPT-4 may excel in planning but struggle with ambiguous ToM scenarios).  
2. **Emergence Thresholds**: Identification of critical model sizes or training data volumes where specific cognitive abilities emerge (e.g., 100B parameters for 5-step planning).  
3. **Architecture Comparison**: Evidence that modular systems (e.g., Hypothetical Minds) outperform end-to-end models in long-horizon tasks by 15–20% SR.  
4. **Benchmark Validation**: HAA scores > 0.8, confirming DCB’s reliability.  

**Impact**:  
- **Scientific**: Establishes a rigorous framework for evaluating LLM cognition, addressing gaps identified in CogBench and related work.  
- **Technical**: Guides AI developers in optimizing architectures for complex reasoning (e.g., integrating explicit belief states).  
- **Societal**: Reduces risks from deploying LLMs in socially interactive roles by highlighting ToM limitations.

### 5. **Conclusion**  
This proposal outlines a novel approach to evaluating LLMs’ emergent cognitive abilities through adaptive benchmarking. By combining RL-driven task sampling, multi-modal validation, and architectural comparisons, DCB will advance our understanding of LLMs as dynamic intelligent systems. The outcomes will inform both AI research and cognitive science, fostering models that robustly handle real-world planning and social reasoning.
