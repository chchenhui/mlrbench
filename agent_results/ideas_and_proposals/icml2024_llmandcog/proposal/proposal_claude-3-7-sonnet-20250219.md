# Dynamic Curriculum Benchmarking for Emergent Cognitive Abilities in Large Language Models

## 1. Introduction

### Background
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, from machine translation to standardized tests and conversational interfaces. Perhaps most intriguing is their exhibition of emergent abilities—capabilities not explicitly trained for but arising from scale and extensive pretraining. These emergent phenomena are particularly evident in cognitive domains such as reasoning, navigation, planning, and theory of mind (ToM), where LLMs show unexpected proficiency despite lacking explicit cognitive architectures.

Current evaluation methodologies for these emergent cognitive abilities suffer from significant limitations. Most benchmarks employ static, pre-defined test sets that fail to adapt to a model's performance level, making it difficult to determine the precise emergence thresholds of specific cognitive abilities. As noted by Li et al. (2023), LLMs display varying degrees of ToM capabilities in multi-agent settings, but existing evaluations offer limited insight into the development trajectory of these capabilities. Similarly, Dong et al. (2024) identified emergent planning behaviors in LLMs, yet we lack systematic frameworks to measure the progression and sophistication of such planning abilities across different model architectures and scales.

The traditional approach to benchmark design—creating fixed test sets with predetermined difficulty levels—is ill-suited for capturing the nuanced developmental trajectories of cognitive abilities in LLMs. This approach cannot identify precisely when and how cognitive capabilities emerge as model scale or training methodology changes, nor can it provide fair comparisons between fine-tuned end-to-end models and those augmented with external modules (as exemplified by the "Hypothetical Minds" architecture proposed by Cross et al., 2024).

### Research Objectives
This research proposal aims to develop and validate a Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB) for measuring emergent cognitive abilities in LLMs. The DCB will focus specifically on planning and theory of mind—two fundamental cognitive capabilities that underpin many complex reasoning tasks. Our specific objectives are to:

1. Design an algorithmic framework for generating progressive sequences of planning and ToM tasks that adapt in difficulty based on an LLM's demonstrated performance.

2. Develop reinforcement learning-based task samplers that can efficiently explore the space of possible tasks at each difficulty level.

3. Create metrics and visualization tools for tracking emergence patterns across different model architectures, sizes, and training methodologies.

4. Establish reliable human-in-the-loop validation protocols to ensure benchmark accuracy and relevance.

5. Apply the DCB to compare the cognitive trajectories of fine-tuned end-to-end LLMs versus modular augmented architectures.

### Significance
The proposed research addresses a critical gap in our understanding of LLM capabilities. By creating a dynamic benchmark framework that adjusts to model performance, we can more precisely characterize the emergence of cognitive abilities like planning and ToM. This has several important implications:

First, it will provide researchers with a more nuanced picture of how cognitive capabilities develop across different model architectures, training methodologies, and scales. Rather than simply declaring that a model "can" or "cannot" perform a certain cognitive task, the DCB will reveal the gradient of capabilities and the specific conditions under which they emerge.

Second, it will enable fairer comparisons between different approaches to enhancing LLM cognitive abilities, such as the end-to-end fine-tuning approach versus the modular augmentation approach exemplified by Cross et al.'s "Hypothetical Minds." This will help guide future research directions in LLM development.

Third, the benchmark will yield insights into the relationship between language modeling objectives and emergent cognitive capabilities, potentially informing the design of more efficient training procedures specifically targeted at developing these capabilities.

Finally, the DCB will contribute to the broader discourse on the relationship between LLMs and human cognition by providing a systematic framework for mapping the development of cognitive abilities in artificial systems, which can then be compared to developmental trajectories in humans.

## 2. Methodology

Our methodology encompasses the design of the Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB), the task generation framework, the evaluation protocol, and the experimental design for validating the benchmark.

### 2.1 Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark Framework

The DCB will consist of two primary cognitive domains: planning and theory of mind (ToM). Within each domain, we will define a space of possible tasks parameterized by difficulty factors.

#### 2.1.1 Planning Domain

The planning domain will focus on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and action sequencing to achieve goals. The difficulty parameters include:

1. **Horizon length**: The number of steps required to solve the planning problem.
2. **State complexity**: The dimensionality and complexity of the state representation.
3. **Action space size**: The number of possible actions at each step.
4. **Goal clarity**: How explicitly the goal is specified in the task description.
5. **Environmental dynamics**: Predictability of state transitions given actions.

The planning tasks will be instantiated in various contexts, including:
- Navigation puzzles in grid worlds
- Sequential decision making in narrative scenarios
- Resource allocation problems
- Multi-step logical reasoning tasks

#### 2.1.2 Theory of Mind Domain

The ToM domain will focus on tasks requiring models to reason about the mental states of other agents. The difficulty parameters include:

1. **ToM order**: First-order (what agent A believes), second-order (what agent A believes about agent B's beliefs), etc.
2. **Agent complexity**: The complexity of the agent behavior being modeled.
3. **Belief dynamics**: How beliefs change over time and with new information.
4. **False belief complexity**: The degree to which agents hold incorrect beliefs about the world.
5. **Communication channels**: The availability and clarity of communication between agents.

The ToM tasks will be instantiated in various contexts, including:
- Sally-Anne style false belief tests
- Multi-agent coordination problems
- Strategic games with incomplete information
- Social reasoning scenarios in narrative contexts

### 2.2 Task Generation Algorithm

We propose a reinforcement learning-based task generation framework that adaptively creates tasks based on model performance.

#### 2.2.1 Task Representation

Each task $t$ in domain $d$ (planning or ToM) is represented as a vector of difficulty parameters $p_d = [p_1, p_2, ..., p_k]$ where each $p_i$ corresponds to one of the difficulty dimensions described in sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.

#### 2.2.2 Task Generation Model

We will implement a task generator $G_d(p_d)$ for each domain $d$ that produces a specific task instance given the difficulty parameters. For text-based tasks, we will use a template-based approach where templates are populated based on the difficulty parameters. For instance, a planning task template might be:

"You have access to the following items: {items}. Your goal is to {goal}. The constraints are {constraints}."

Where {items}, {goal}, and {constraints} are determined by the difficulty parameters.

#### 2.2.3 Adaptive Task Sampling Algorithm

We formulate the task difficulty adaptation as a bandit problem. Let $M$ be the LLM being evaluated, and $R(M, t)$ be the reward (performance) of $M$ on task $t$. We define the optimal difficulty as the point where the model achieves approximately 50-70% success rate, indicating that the task is challenging but not impossible.

The adaptive sampling algorithm is as follows:

1. Initialize a distribution over difficulty parameters $P(p_d)$.
2. Sample a set of tasks $T = \{t_1, t_2, ..., t_n\}$ where each $t_i = G_d(p_{d,i})$ and $p_{d,i} \sim P(p_d)$.
3. Evaluate the model $M$ on each task $t_i$ to obtain rewards $R(M, t_i)$.
4. Update the distribution $P(p_d)$ based on the rewards, increasing the probability of parameters that yield tasks with 50-70% success rate.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for $N$ iterations or until convergence.

Mathematically, the update rule for $P(p_d)$ is:

$$P(p_d) \propto P(p_d) \cdot \exp(\alpha \cdot (|R(M, G_d(p_d)) - 0.6| - \beta))$$

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate and $\beta$ is a regularization term to prevent extreme difficulty levels.

### 2.3 Performance Tracking and Emergence Detection

For each model $M$, we will track performance across the difficulty spectrum for both domains. This allows us to construct a performance profile $P_M(d, p_d)$ that maps domain $d$ and difficulty parameters $p_d$ to expected performance.

#### 2.3.1 Emergence Threshold Definition

We define the emergence threshold $\theta_M(d, c)$ for model $M$ in domain $d$ for capability $c$ as the minimum difficulty level at which the model demonstrates capability $c$ with at least 50% success rate. Formally:

$$\theta_M(d, c) = \min_{p_d} \{p_d : P_M(d, p_d, c) \geq 0.5\}$$

where $P_M(d, p_d, c)$ is the performance of model $M$ on tasks in domain $d$ with difficulty parameters $p_d$ requiring capability $c$.

#### 2.3.2 Capability Hierarchy

We will establish a hierarchy of capabilities for each domain. For example, in the planning domain:
1. Single-step action selection
2. Two-step planning
3. Multi-step planning with deterministic dynamics
4. Planning under uncertainty
5. Meta-planning (planning about planning)

For the ToM domain:
1. First-order false belief understanding
2. Second-order false belief understanding
3. Belief updating with partial information
4. Strategic reasoning based on others' beliefs
5. Recursive social reasoning

### 2.4 Human-in-the-Loop Validation

To ensure the validity of the benchmark, we will implement a human validation protocol:

1. **Task validity check**: Human experts will review a sample of generated tasks to ensure they are coherent, well-posed, and of appropriate difficulty.

2. **Response evaluation validation**: Humans will evaluate a sample of model responses to validate the automatic scoring system.

3. **Edge case identification**: Humans will analyze model failures to identify patterns and potential gaps in the benchmark.

The validation will follow a structured protocol:

1. For each domain and major difficulty level, select 100 task instances.
2. Have 3 human evaluators independently assess each instance for validity and clarity.
3. For each task, collect model responses from at least 5 different LLMs.
4. Have evaluators score the responses and compare with automatic scores.
5. Compute inter-rater reliability and agreement with automatic scoring.

### 2.5 Experimental Design

#### 2.5.1 Model Selection

We will evaluate a diverse set of models to ensure broad applicability:

1. **Size variations**: Small (1-3B parameters), medium (7-13B), and large (70B+) LLMs
2. **Architecture variations**: Decoder-only, encoder-decoder
3. **Training methodology variations**: Fine-tuned vs. few-shot learning
4. **Augmentation variations**: Pure LLMs vs. modular augmented systems (e.g., "Hypothetical Minds")

#### 2.5.2 Evaluation Protocol

For each model, we will:

1. Run the adaptive task sampling algorithm for 1000 iterations per domain.
2. Construct the performance profile across difficulty parameters.
3. Determine emergence thresholds for each capability in the hierarchy.
4. Compare emergence patterns across model variations.

#### 2.5.3 Metrics

We will employ the following metrics:

1. **Emergence Curve**: Plot of performance vs. difficulty for each capability.
2. **Emergence Threshold Vector**: Vector of difficulty thresholds for each capability.
3. **Cognitive Generalization Index (CGI)**: Measure of how well performance generalizes across task variations within the same difficulty level.
4. **Cognitive Transfer Index (CTI)**: Measure of how well performance on one type of cognitive task predicts performance on another.

The CGI is calculated as:

$$\text{CGI}_M(d, p_d) = 1 - \frac{\sigma(R(M, T(p_d)))}{\mu(R(M, T(p_d)))}$$

where $T(p_d)$ is the set of tasks generated with parameters $p_d$, and $\sigma$ and $\mu$ are the standard deviation and mean of rewards across these tasks.

The CTI between capabilities $c_1$ and $c_2$ is calculated as:

$$\text{CTI}_M(c_1, c_2) = \text{corr}(\theta_M(d, c_1), \theta_M(d, c_2))$$

where corr is the correlation between emergence thresholds across different models.
