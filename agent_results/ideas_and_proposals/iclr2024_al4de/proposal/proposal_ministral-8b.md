Interpretable Neural Operators for Transparent Scientific Discovery with Differential Equations

## 2. Introduction

### Background

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various scientific domains by providing efficient and powerful tools for solving complex problems. One such domain is the solution of differential equations (DEs), which are fundamental in fields such as climate modeling, fluid dynamics, and material science. Traditional methods for solving DEs, such as finite difference methods or finite element methods, are often computationally expensive and limited in their ability to handle high-dimensional or complex problems. In recent years, machine learning techniques, particularly neural operators, have emerged as promising alternatives for solving DEs. Neural operators leverage deep learning to approximate the solution operators of DEs, enabling high-resolution and efficient solutions.

However, the widespread adoption of neural operators in scientific contexts is hindered by a lack of interpretability. Neural operators, while powerful, are often considered "black boxes," making it difficult for scientists to understand the underlying mechanisms and validate the results. This lack of transparency is particularly problematic in high-stakes domains where trust and interpretability are critical. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop interpretable neural operators that can provide human-understandable explanations while maintaining high predictive accuracy.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a framework for interpretable neural operators that can solve DEs while generating human-understandable explanations. The specific objectives are:

1. **Combine Symbolic and Neural Models**: Develop a hybrid model that combines symbolic expressions with neural networks to approximate the solution operators of DEs. The symbolic expressions will capture the globally influential terms, while the neural networks will capture the fine-grained residuals.

2. **Enhance Interpretability**: Incorporate attention mechanisms and counterfactual explanations to highlight the critical regions or input parameters that influence the solution. This will provide insights into the underlying physical processes and enhance the interpretability of the model.

3. **Validate and Benchmark**: Evaluate the proposed framework on benchmark PDEs and compare it with traditional solvers and existing neural operators. The evaluation will focus on both accuracy and explanation quality.

### Significance

The significance of this research lies in its potential to bridge the gap between data-driven efficiency and scientific interpretability. By developing interpretable neural operators, we can enhance trust and utility in scientific domains, facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration and accelerating AI adoption in high-stakes applications. The proposed framework has the potential to revolutionize the way DEs are solved, providing a transparent and efficient alternative to traditional methods.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Collection

The data for this research will consist of benchmark PDEs, such as the Navier-Stokes equation, the heat equation, and the wave equation. These PDEs are widely used in scientific simulations and provide a suitable basis for benchmarking the proposed framework. The data will include initial conditions, boundary conditions, and known solutions. Additionally, domain-specific knowledge, such as physical laws and constraints, will be incorporated into the data to enhance the interpretability of the model.

### 3.2 Algorithmic Steps

The proposed framework consists of three main components: symbolic-neural hybrid models, attention-driven feature attribution, and counterfactual explanations. The algorithmic steps are outlined below:

1. **Symbolic-Neural Hybrid Models**:
   - **Step 1**: Preprocess the input data by extracting relevant features and transforming them into a suitable format for the symbolic model.
   - **Step 2**: Train a sparse regression model to approximate the globally influential terms in the DE solution using the extracted features. The sparse regression model will generate symbolic expressions that capture the dominant effects.
   - **Step 3**: Train a neural network to capture the fine-grained residuals that are not captured by the symbolic expressions. The neural network will process the input data and generate the residuals.
   - **Step 4**: Combine the symbolic expressions and the neural network outputs to approximate the solution operator of the DE.

2. **Attention-Driven Feature Attribution**:
   - **Step 1**: Incorporate trainable attention layers into the neural network to identify the spatiotemporal regions or input parameters that are most critical to the solution.
   - **Step 2**: Train the attention layers using a loss function that encourages the attention weights to highlight the important regions or parameters.
   - **Step 3**: Visualize the attention weights to provide insights into the underlying physical processes and enhance the interpretability of the model.

3. **Counterfactual Explanations**:
   - **Step 1**: Generate perturbations to the input data, such as initial conditions or boundary conditions.
   - **Step 2**: Trace the effects of the perturbations on the solution using the proposed framework.
   - **Step 3**: Analyze the changes in the solution to highlight the causal relationships between the input parameters and the solution.

### 3.3 Mathematical Formulas

The symbolic-neural hybrid model can be represented mathematically as follows:

Given a differential equation \( \mathcal{L} u = f \), where \( \mathcal{L} \) is the differential operator and \( u \) is the solution, the symbolic-neural hybrid model approximates the solution operator \( \mathcal{L}^{-1} \) as:

\[ \mathcal{L}^{-1} \approx \mathcal{S} + \mathcal{N} \]

where \( \mathcal{S} \) is the symbolic model that captures the globally influential terms, and \( \mathcal{N} \) is the neural network that captures the fine-grained residuals.

The symbolic model \( \mathcal{S} \) can be represented as:

\[ \mathcal{S}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \alpha_i \phi_i(x) \]

where \( \alpha_i \) are the coefficients of the symbolic expression, \( \phi_i(x) \) are the basis functions, and \( k \) is the number of basis functions.

The neural network \( \mathcal{N} \) can be represented as:

\[ \mathcal{N}(x) = \sigma(Wx + b) \]

where \( W \) and \( b \) are the weights and biases of the neural network, and \( \sigma \) is the activation function.
