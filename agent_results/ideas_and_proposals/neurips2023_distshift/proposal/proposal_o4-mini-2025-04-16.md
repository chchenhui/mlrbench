Title:
Preserving Distributional Robustness in Fine-Tuned Foundation Models through Robustness Teacher Distillation and Activation Regularization

1. Introduction  
Background  
Real‐world deployment of machine learning models frequently encounters distribution shifts, wherein the test or target data distribution differs from the training (pretraining) distribution. Foundation models—large pretrained models such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) or Llama‐2—offer unprecedented in‐distribution and zero‐shot performance, yet when fine‐tuned on a specialized downstream dataset their out‐of‐distribution (OOD) robustness often degrades significantly (Kumar et al., 2022). This degradation poses grave risks in high‐stakes domains like healthcare, criminal justice, or environmental monitoring, where model failures under distribution shift can lead to incorrect diagnoses, unfair decisions, or ecological mismanagement.

Research Objectives  
We propose to design, implement, and validate a knowledge‐distillation framework—Robustness Teacher Distillation (RTD)—that preserves the distributional robustness of a foundation model during downstream fine‐tuning. Our objectives are:  
  • To formalize the fine‐tuning robustness degradation phenomenon and quantify the trade‐off between in‐distribution (ID) accuracy and OOD generalization.  
  • To develop a hybrid loss function combining task‐specific cross‐entropy, a distillation loss on OOD‐style examples, and an activation‐preserving regularizer that constrains internal representations.  
  • To generate controlled OOD examples via domain‐specific transformations and adversarial perturbations for robust teacher guidance.  
  • To evaluate RTD across vision (WILDS benchmark) and language (medical/legal NLP) tasks, comparing against standard fine‐tuning, LoRA (Hu et al., 2021), WiSE‐FT (Wortsman et al., 2021), and Self‐Distillation Fine‐Tuning (Yang et al., 2024).  

Significance  
A successful RTD framework will (i) reduce the OOD performance gap of fine‐tuned foundation models by at least 50%, (ii) maintain ID performance within 1–2% of standard fine‐tuning, and (iii) be parameter‐ and computation‐efficient via lightweight distillation. This will enable the safe adaptation of foundation models in medicine, law, and other sensitive domains, advancing robustness research at the intersection of distribution shifts and foundation models.

2. Methodology  
We describe in detail the RTD framework, from data collection through algorithmic procedure, and outline the experimental design including evaluation metrics.

2.1 Notation and Problem Statement  
Let $M_T$ denote the pretrained foundation model (teacher) with parameters $\theta_T$, and $M_S$ the student model with parameters $\theta_S$ initialized from $\theta_T$. We have:  
  • A labeled in‐distribution dataset $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ID}} = \{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ for the downstream task.  
  • An (unlabeled or pseudo‐labeled) set of out‐of‐distribution examples $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{OOD}} = \{x_j^\prime\}_{j=1}^M$ generated via controlled perturbations of $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ID}}$.  

Our goal is to update $\theta_S$ to optimize task performance on $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ID}}$ while preserving the teacher’s OOD predictive behavior and internal activations.

2.2 Hybrid Loss Function  
We define three loss components:

1. Task Loss (Cross‐Entropy)  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{task}}
= -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{c=1}^C \mathbf{1}\{y_i=c\}\,\log p_S(c\mid x_i)\,,
$$
where $p_S(\cdot\mid x)=\mathrm{softmax}(z_S(x))$ and $z_S(x)$ is the student’s pre‐softmax logits.

2. Distillation Loss on OOD Examples  
We compute soft labels from the teacher on perturbed inputs $x_j^\prime$:
$$
q_T(c\mid x_j^\prime)
= \mathrm{softmax}\bigl(z_T(x_j^\prime)/T\bigr)_c\,,
\quad
q_S(c\mid x_j^\prime)
= \mathrm{softmax}\bigl(z_S(x_j^\prime)/T\bigr)_c,
$$
with temperature $T>1$. The KL‐divergence distillation loss is
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{KD}}
= \frac{1}{M}\sum_{j=1}^M \mathrm{KL}\bigl(q_T(\cdot\mid x_j^\prime)\,\Vert\,q_S(\cdot\mid x_j^\prime)\bigr).
$$

3. Activation‐Preserving Regularizer  
Let $a_T^\ell(x)$ and $a_S^\ell(x)$ be the teacher’s and student’s activations at a chosen intermediate layer $\ell$. We impose
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{AR}}
= \frac{1}{|\mathcal{B}|\cdot d_\ell}
\sum_{x\in\mathcal{B}} \bigl\|a_T^\ell(x) - a_S^\ell(x)\bigr\|_2^2,
$$
computed over a mini‐batch $\mathcal{B}$ of size $|\mathcal{B}|$ and activation dimension $d_\ell$.

Overall training loss:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{total}}
= \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{task}}
+ \lambda_{\mathrm{KD}}\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{KD}}
+ \lambda_{\mathrm{AR}}\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{AR}},
$$
where hyperparameters $\lambda_{\mathrm{KD}},\lambda_{\mathrm{AR}}\ge0$ balance robustness preservation against task adaptation.

2.3 OOD Example Generation  
We propose two complementary strategies:

• Adversarial‐like Perturbations (Universal and Discrete):  
  – For vision: apply randomized Gaussian blur, color jitter, JPEG compression, and PGD‐style adversarial noises at low $\ell_\infty$ budget.  
  – For text: use synonym replacement, back‐translation, and adversarial token swaps guided by gradients.

• Domain‐Specific Transformations:  
  – Healthcare imaging: simulate scanner artifacts (noise, motion blur).  
  – Legal/clinical text: insert out‐of‐vocabulary terms and specialized jargon synonyms.

These generate $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{OOD}}$ with controlled shift severity.

2.4 Training Algorithm  
Pseudocode for a single epoch of RTD fine‐tuning:

```
Input: Teacher model M_T (fixed θ_T), Student model M_S (initialized θ_S), 
       ID data D_ID, transformation set T, hyperparameters λ_KD, λ_AR, T
For each minibatch B_ID⊆D_ID:
  1. Sample ID examples {(x_i,y_i)}←B_ID.
  2. Generate OOD examples B_OOD={t(x_i) | x_i∈B_ID, t∈T}.
  3. Compute task loss L_task on (x_i,y_i) via student logits.
  4. Compute teacher soft labels q_T on B_OOD, and student soft labels q_S.
  5. Compute L_KD = average KL(q_T || q_S) over B_OOD.
  6. Forward both M_T and M_S on combined inputs B_ID∪B_OOD to extract activations at layer ℓ.
  7. Compute L_AR = mean squared difference of activations.
  8. Compute total loss L_total = L_task + λ_KD L_KD + λ_AR L_AR.
  9. Backpropagate ∇_{θ_S} L_total and update θ_S via AdamW.
Output: Fine‐tuned student model M_S
```

2.6 Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics  
Datasets:  
  – Vision: WILDS‐Camelyon17 (hospital‐shifted histopathology), iWildCam (camera‐trap species).  
  – Language: MedNLI (hospital record variation), BIOS (biomedical QA).  

Baselines:  
  • Standard fine‐tuning (FT).  
  • LoRA (parameter‐efficient FT).  
  • WiSE‐FT (zero‐shot & FT weight ensembling).  
  • Self‐Distillation Fine‐Tuning (SDFT).  

Metrics:  
  – ID Accuracy $A_{\mathrm{ID}}$ and OOD Accuracy $A_{\mathrm{OOD}}$.  
  – Robustness Gap: $\Delta_{\mathrm{rob}}=A_{\mathrm{ID}}-A_{\mathrm{OOD}}$.  
  – Calibration: Expected Calibration Error (ECE).  
  – Parameter & FLOPs Overhead.  

A successful RTD should achieve $A_{\mathrm{OOD}}$ increase of ≥5% absolute over FT and halved $\Delta_{\mathrm{rob}}$, without more than 10% additional compute.

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Expected Outcomes  
  • Quantitative: RTD will reduce the robustness gap $\Delta_{\mathrm{rob}}$ by ≥50% across tasks and maintain ID accuracy within 1–2% of FT. We anticipate improvements of 5–10% absolute in OOD accuracy compared to FT, and 2–4% over state‐of‐the‐art baselines (WiSE‐FT, SDFT).  
  • Qualitative: Activation analyses will show that RTD better preserves feature representations of the pretrained teacher on OOD data, confirmed via representational similarity metrics and t-SNE visualizations.  
  • Ablation Studies: We will isolate the contributions of the KD term, the AR term, and each OOD transformation class, providing guidelines for hyperparameter selection and transformation design.

Broader Impact  
  • Robust Deployment: RTD offers a principled framework for deploying foundation models in sensitive domains (medical imaging, legal NLP) where distribution shifts are endemic, thereby enhancing safety and fairness.  
  • Research Community Contribution: We will release code, pretrained RTD checkpoints, and curated transformation scripts to foster reproducibility and further study of distribution‐shift robustness.  
  • Theoretical Insights: By quantifying the trade‐offs in the hybrid loss and analyzing activation preservation, we expect to deepen theoretical understanding of why fine‐tuning erodes OOD robustness and how to mitigate it.

Conclusion  
Our proposed Robustness Teacher Distillation method addresses a central challenge in adapting foundation models to specialized tasks under distribution shifts. By combining soft‐label guidance on controlled OOD examples with activation‐level regularization, RTD creates a constrained adaptation pathway that retains the broad generalization capabilities of the teacher. Rigorous empirical evaluation on vision and language benchmarks will validate its efficacy, paving the way for safer, more reliable applications of large pretrained models in real‐world high‐stakes settings.
