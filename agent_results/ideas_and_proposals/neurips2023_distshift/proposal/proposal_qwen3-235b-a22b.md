### Preserving Robustness During Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models: A Knowledge Distillation Approach  

### Introduction  

Foundation models have become a cornerstone in modern machine learning, demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. Their ability to generalize effectively is largely attributed to their training on vast, diverse datasets, which allows them to capture broad statistical patterns and semantic relationships. However, when these models are fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks, their robustness to distribution shifts often degrades significantly. This issue is particularly problematic in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, legal processing, and criminal justice, where the deployed models must maintain reliable performance even when faced with data from unseen domains or underrepresented populations. Several studies have demonstrated that while fine-tuning enhances task-specific accuracy, it can distort the pretrained features that contribute to out-of-distribution generalization, leading to performance drops when models encounter data different from their training distribution. The challenge, therefore, is to devise fine-tuning techniques that preserve the model’s robustness while adapting it to domain-specific tasks.  

Recent literature highlights the tradeoff between task specialization and robustness, suggesting that conventional fine-tuning methods may not fully account for the broader distribution shifts that models encounter in real-world scenarios. For instance, Kumar et al. (2022) noted that fine-tuning can lead to a distortion of pretrained features, adversely affecting out-of-distribution performance. Similarly, Yang et al. (2024) proposed a self-distillation approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, demonstrating that maintaining alignment with the original model’s behavior can improve robustness during adaptation. These findings indicate that knowledge distillation—where a student model learns to mimic the behavior of a robust teacher—can provide a promising strategy for preserving distributional robustness during fine-tuning.  

The primary motivation for this proposal arises from the observation that fine-tuning often prioritizes in-distribution accuracy, neglecting distributional robustness in a way that leads to systematic performance failures in deployment. In fields like medical imaging or legal document processing, where data heterogeneity is common, maintaining robustness under distribution shift is essential for ensuring reliable performance. Current adaptation methods, such as efficient fine-tuning strategies like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), focus on computational efficiency but may not explicitly account for robustness preservation. By integrating knowledge distillation with a robustness-preserving mechanism, we aim to develop an approach that enables foundation models to undergo fine-tuning without sacrificing their generalization capabilities. This research will investigate how distillation-based strategies, combined with domain-specific transformations and perturbations, can help maintain the original model’s robustness while allowing for effective task adaptation.

### Research Objectives  

This research aims to develop a knowledge distillation framework that preserves robustness during the fine-tuning of foundation models. The primary goal is to mitigate the degradation in out-of-distribution performance that typically occurs when pretrained models are adapted to specialized tasks. This objective is driven by the findings of Kumar et al. (2022), which highlight that fine-tuning can distort previously acquired features, thereby negatively affecting a model's ability to generalize under distribution shifts. Current practices in fine-tuning overwhelmingly emphasize in-distribution accuracy, often disregarding the broader robustness properties that make foundation models valuable in real-world, high-stakes deployments. Therefore, we propose a fine-tuning strategy that explicitly constrains learning in a way that retains the pretrained model’s robustness properties while enabling specialization.  

To achieve this, we seek to address three key research questions. First, does the proposed distillation-based framework effectively preserve the foundation model’s distributional robustness? While prior approaches such as Discrete Adversarial Distillation (Zhou et al., 2023) and correlation distance-based knowledge distillation (Kim et al., 2023) demonstrate successful robustness improvements through teacher-student learning, they were primarily designed for independent student models rather than fine-tuned variations of a powerful foundation model. Our approach will build on these techniques by treating the pretrained foundation model as the robustness teacher, ensuring that fine-tuning does not compromise its generalization capabilities. This framework will be evaluated against standard fine-tuning baselines using benchmark datasets that exhibit distribution shifts.  

Second, how does our adaptation method affect task specialization and in-distribution performance? One of the main limitations of traditional fine-tuning is that while it improves performance on target distributions, it weakens generalization beyond them. Recent attempts like Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT) (Yang et al., 2024) have shown promise in maintaining original model alignment while preserving performance on downstream tasks, but they do not explicitly incorporate mechanisms for enforcing robustness. Our research will introduce a hybrid loss function that balances task-specific performance and robustness to distribution shifts. This loss will use distillation techniques to align the fine-tuned model’s behavior with the foundation model’s predictions on perturbed inputs, ensuring that the student maintains the teacher’s out-of-distribution capabilities while optimizing for task-specific accuracy. The effectiveness of this balance will be evaluated through performance comparisons across multiple domains, such as medical imaging and specialized NLP tasks like legal or healthcare-related text classification.  

Third, how does the proposed approach compare with existing fine-tuning and regularization methods in terms of robustness preservation? Efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) have allowed researchers to adapt large language models without modifying all weights, but they have not been explicitly designed to preserve distributional robustness. WiSE-FT (Wortsman et al., 2021) improves robustness by ensembling zero-shot and fine-tuned models, but it relies on an additional post-processing step without directly influencing the fine-tuning process. In contrast, our framework will integrate robustness preservation directly into the fine-tuning phase by incorporating distillation loss and activation pattern regularization. We will empirically compare our approach with these and other methods, particularly focusing on how well our fine-tuned models maintain performance when exposed to shifted test distributions in biomedical, legal, or robotic applications.  

By answering these questions, our research will contribute a new fine-tuning paradigm that enhances foundation models' ability to maintain robustness. This work will provide practical insights into how knowledge distillation can be used to constrain learning in specialized adaptation tasks, ensuring that fine-tuned models retain their original generalization potential. Through these contributions, we aim to develop a method that is particularly impactful for real-world applications where distribution shifts are inevitable.

### Methodology

Our proposed approach combines knowledge distillation and activation pattern regularization to preserve out-of-distribution robustness during fine-tuning. The framework builds upon prior work such as Discrete Adversarial Distillation (Zhou et al., 2023) and Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (Yang et al., 2024), introducing a novel distillation mechanism tailored to maintaining robustness when adapting foundation models to specialized tasks. The key idea is to use the pretrained foundation model as a teacher that guides the fine-tuning process, ensuring that the student model retains the fundamental generalization capabilities learned during pretraining. We formalize our approach through a mathematical framework that integrates both task-specific learning and distillation-based regularization.

Let $f_\theta(x)$ represent the foundation model with parameters $\theta$, and let $f_{\theta'}(x)$ be the student model derived from fine-tuning. We aim to optimize $\theta'$ over a target dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ while preserving robustness against distribution shifts. Our objective function is defined as:

$$\min_{\theta'} \mathcal{L}_{task}(x, y) + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{distillation}(x^{pert}) + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{activation}(x^{trans})$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{task}(x, y)$ is the standard loss (e.g., cross-entropy) for the target task, $\mathcal{L}_{distillation}(x^{pert})$ is the distillation loss that enforces alignment with the teacher model’s predictions on perturbed inputs, and $\mathcal{L}_{activation}(x^{trans})$ ensures that the student model retains the activation patterns of the foundation model on domain-transformed samples. The hyperparameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ control the tradeoff between task performance, distillation consistency, and activation preservation.

For the distillation loss $\mathcal{L}_{distillation}$, we use a KL-divergence-based approach, where the student model learns to match the label distribution predicted by the foundation model on perturbed examples:

$$\mathcal{L}_{distillation}(x^{pert}, p_\text{teacher}) = D_{KL}(p_\text{teacher}(x^{pert}) \| p_\text{student}(x^{pert}))$$

Here, $x^{pert}$ represents the input after controlled perturbations, such as noise injection, data augmentations, or adversarial transformations. We generate these examples using established methods like Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) or data-specific augmentations relevant to the domain (e.g., medical imaging perturbations such as tissue contrast variation or text-specific transformations like synonym substitution).

In addition to distillation, we introduce $\mathcal{L}_{activation}$ to preserve the model’s internal knowledge representation. Following the insights of Kumar et al. (2022), we minimize the mean squared error between the teacher and student activation maps across different layers, ensuring that fine-tuning does not distort the pretrained model’s learned features:

$$\mathcal{L}_{activation}(x^{trans}, f_\text{teacher}, f_\text{student}) = \mathbb{E}_{x^{trans}} \left[\sum_{l=1}^L \|f_\text{teacher}^{(l)}(x^{trans}) - f_\text{student}^{(l)}(x^{trans})\|_2^2 \right]$$

where $L$ is the number of layers considered, $f_\text{teacher}^{(l)}(x^{trans})$ denotes the activation of the teacher at layer $l$ on transformed data $x^{trans}$, and $f_\text{student}^{(l)}(x^{trans})$ denotes the student’s corresponding activation. The transformations $x^{trans}$ include domain-specific augmentations, such as medical image distortions or linguistic variations relevant to legal or healthcare texts.

Our experiments will be conducted on foundation models such as Llama-2-Chat for NLP tasks and CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) for vision tasks, using benchmarks that capture domain shifts, including WILDS (Koh et al., 2021) for medical imaging and legal document classification. We will compare our method against standard fine-tuning, WiSE-FT (Wortsman et al., 2021), SDFT (Yang et al., 2024), and LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) to evaluate its effectiveness in preserving model robustness while achieving task specialization.

### Expected Outcomes

We anticipate several significant results from this research. First, by integrating a knowledge distillation framework with activation regularization, our method will demonstrate superior robustness under distribution shift compared to standard fine-tuning approaches. This is expected because distillation losses align fine-tuned models with their robust pretrained versions, and regularization preserves the original activation patterns, mitigating feature distortion. To quantify these outcomes, we will employ standard benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics.  

In the context of computer vision tasks, we will use the WILDS benchmark, which includes datasets such as Camelyon17 for medical imaging and iWildCam for wildlife monitoring. These datasets naturally contain domain shifts, allowing us to measure how effectively our framework maintains performance across environments. We will evaluate model performance using standard robustness metrics, including expected calibration error (ECE), distributional robustness (measured as the difference between in-distribution and worst-case group accuracy), and overall model accuracy. We expect our approach to show a statistically significant improvement in these metrics compared to baselines such as conventional fine-tuning and WiSE-FT (Wortsman et al., 2021), particularly in extreme distribution shifts.  

For NLP tasks, we will conduct experiments on biomedical and legal classification benchmarks, where distribution shifts arise from variations in terminology, writing style, or data sources across different institutions. We will apply our distillation-based fine-tuning method to models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), and Llama-2-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023), assessing their performance across multiple test sets. Our evaluation metrics will include task-specific accuracy, out-of-distribution generalization ability on shifted test sets, and robustness measures such as worst-case performance across domains. We expect that our distillation-based approach will significantly reduce catastrophic forgetting and distribution gap issues compared to standard fine-tuning and SDFT (Yang et al., 2024).  

Additionally, we will explore the generative capabilities of foundation models to enhance discriminative tasks via data augmentation. Leveraging recent advances in prompt engineering, we will apply our framework to generate synthetic data that aligns with the original pretraining distribution, mitigating distribution shift challenges. By combining distillation with controlled prompting mechanisms, we aim to improve the model's ability to generalize across data variations while maintaining high performance on the target task.

### Significance and Impact

The proposed research holds considerable importance in tackling a critical challenge in modern machine learning: the degradation of robustness during the fine-tuning of large foundation models. By introducing a knowledge distillation framework that preserves distributional robustness, our approach could significantly enhance the reliability of fine-tuned models in high-stakes domains where distribution shifts frequently occur. This is particularly notable given the prevalence of distribution shifts in real-world applications such as biomedicine, legal document processing, and criminal justice, where systematic failures can have far-reaching consequences.

The anticipated impact of this work extends beyond merely improving fine-tuning procedures; it seeks to advance the broader field of foundation models by providing a novel methodology that addresses the trade-off between task-specific performance and generalization capabilities. This approach can foster the development of foundation models that are not only accurate on their target tasks but also resilient in the face of data distribution changes. This resilience is essential for deploying models in diverse environments, ensuring they perform consistently without requiring extensive retraining. By addressing the robustness issue, we aim to empower developers and researchers to adapt models more efficiently, particularly in specialized contexts where data may be scarce.

Furthermore, this research aligns with the objectives of the workshop on distribution shifts, focusing on new frontiers with foundation models. The workshop emphasizes understanding and mitigating robustness issues across various applications, and by showcasing a practical solution that harnesses the strengths of knowledge distillation, we contribute to the ongoing discussions and innovations in this area. Our findings will not only provide insights into effective adaptation strategies for fine-tuned models but also highlight the potential for using generative capabilities of foundation models to enhance discriminative tasks through data augmentation.

This work represents a vital step toward enabling foundation models to be more adaptable while retaining their inherent robustness, offering a pathway for their responsible and effective use in a wider array of applications and contexts. By fostering a better understanding of the interaction between fine-tuning and robustness, we aim to influence future research directions and practical implementations in the field of machine learning. 😊
