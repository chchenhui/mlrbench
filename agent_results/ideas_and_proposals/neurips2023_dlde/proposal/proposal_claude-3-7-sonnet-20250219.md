# Diffusion-Guided Neural Operators for High-Dimensional PDE Solutions

## Introduction

Partial differential equations (PDEs) represent one of the most powerful mathematical tools for modeling complex physical phenomena across various domains including fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, quantum mechanics, and financial mathematics. However, as the dimensionality of these PDEs increases—often necessary to accurately represent real-world systems—traditional numerical methods face the well-known "curse of dimensionality," where computational requirements grow exponentially with the number of dimensions. This fundamental limitation has restricted our ability to simulate and analyze complex high-dimensional systems, creating a critical bottleneck in scientific and engineering advancements.

Recent years have witnessed significant progress in applying deep learning techniques to PDE solving. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) (Raissi et al., 2019) encode physical laws directly into neural networks through differential operators in the loss function. Neural operators (Li et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2021) learn mappings between function spaces to approximate solution operators for parameterized PDEs. While these approaches have demonstrated impressive capabilities in low to moderate dimensions, they still encounter challenges when scaling to truly high-dimensional problems (100+ dimensions), particularly in terms of training efficiency, solution accuracy, and generalization across parameter spaces.

Simultaneously, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in generative modeling, demonstrating remarkable success in generating high-dimensional data like images and audio. These models, which are fundamentally based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), learn to reverse a noise-adding diffusion process to generate complex data distributions. Their ability to model high-dimensional probability distributions and inherent connections to differential equations makes them potentially valuable tools for PDE solving, yet their application in this domain remains relatively unexplored.

This research proposes a novel framework called **Diffusion-Guided Neural Operators (DGNOs)** that bridges these two worlds by leveraging the strengths of diffusion models to enhance neural PDE solvers. Our approach treats the PDE solution process as a structured denoising task, where the forward diffusion process is guided by the PDE's differential operators, and the reverse process is learned to recover the solution from noise. This paradigm naturally handles high dimensionality through the diffusion model's inherent scalability while enforcing PDE constraints via carefully designed physics-informed loss terms.

The primary objectives of this research are to:

1. Develop a unified mathematical framework that integrates diffusion models with neural operator learning for solving high-dimensional PDEs.
2. Design effective training strategies that balance generative score matching with physics-based constraints.
3. Implement efficient computational methods for handling the forward and reverse processes in high dimensions.
4. Demonstrate superior performance on benchmark high-dimensional PDEs compared to existing methods, particularly in problems exceeding 100 dimensions.
5. Apply the framework to real-world applications in computational fluid dynamics and financial mathematics.

The significance of this research extends beyond theoretical advancements. By enabling accurate and efficient solutions to high-dimensional PDEs, our work has the potential to transform computational approaches across multiple scientific and engineering disciplines. For instance, in climate science, high-dimensional PDEs are essential for accurate climate modeling; in finance, they underpin complex option pricing models; and in materials science, they describe quantum mechanical systems governing novel material properties. Successful implementation of our proposed framework would remove a critical computational bottleneck, accelerating research and development in these domains.

## Methodology

### 3.1 Theoretical Framework

Our Diffusion-Guided Neural Operators (DGNOs) framework combines the generative capabilities of diffusion models with the solution mapping abilities of neural operators. We frame the PDE solution process as a structured denoising task, where we learn to progressively transform noise into valid PDE solutions.

Consider a general parameterized PDE of the form:

$$\mathcal{L}_\theta u(x) = f(x), \quad x \in \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$$

with boundary conditions:

$$\mathcal{B}u(x) = g(x), \quad x \in \partial\Omega$$

where $\mathcal{L}_\theta$ is a differential operator parameterized by $\theta$, $u$ is the solution function, $f$ is the forcing function, $\mathcal{B}$ is a boundary operator, and $\Omega$ is a $d$-dimensional domain.

In the DGNO framework, we define a forward diffusion process that gradually adds noise to the solution:

$$du_t = -\frac{1}{2}\beta(t)u_t dt + \sqrt{\beta(t)}dW_t$$

where $u_t$ represents the solution at diffusion time $t \in [0, T]$, $\beta(t)$ is a time-dependent noise schedule, and $W_t$ is the standard Wiener process. Importantly, we modify this standard diffusion process to incorporate the PDE operator:

$$du_t = [-\frac{1}{2}\beta(t)u_t + \alpha(t)\mathcal{L}_\theta u_t]dt + \sqrt{\beta(t)}dW_t$$

where $\alpha(t)$ is a time-dependent weighting function that controls the influence of the PDE operator during diffusion. This modification guides the diffusion process according to the underlying physics, creating a more structured noise process aligned with the PDE dynamics.

The reverse diffusion process, which transforms noise back into the solution, is modeled using a neural network $s_\phi(u_t, t, \theta)$ that approximates the score function:

$$s_\phi(u_t, t, \theta) \approx \nabla_{u_t} \log p_t(u_t|\theta)$$

where $p_t(u_t|\theta)$ is the probability density of $u_t$ given the PDE parameters $\theta$. The reverse SDE that recovers the solution is:

$$du_t = [\frac{1}{2}\beta(t)u_t - \beta(t)s_\phi(u_t, t, \theta)]dt + \sqrt{\beta(t)}d\bar{W}_t$$

where $\bar{W}_t$ is a reverse-time Wiener process.

### 3.2 Neural Network Architecture

The score function $s_\phi(u_t, t, \theta)$ is parameterized using a neural operator architecture that can handle function inputs and outputs. We adopt a modified Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) design with several key enhancements:

1. **Discretization-Invariant Representation**: To handle arbitrary mesh discretizations, we employ a positional encoding layer that maps spatial coordinates to a high-dimensional feature space:

$$\gamma(x) = [\sin(2^0\pi x), \cos(2^0\pi x), \sin(2^1\pi x), \cos(2^1\pi x), ..., \sin(2^{m-1}\pi x), \cos(2^{m-1}\pi x)]$$

2. **Parameter Conditioning**: PDE parameters $\theta$ are embedded using a parameter encoding network $E_\psi(\theta)$ and injected into the neural operator through adaptive instance normalization layers.

3. **Time Conditioning**: Diffusion time $t$ is encoded using sinusoidal embeddings and integrated throughout the network via adaptive modulation.

4. **Multi-Scale Architecture**: We implement a U-Net-like structure with multiple resolution levels to capture both local and global features of the solution field.

The overall network architecture consists of:

$$s_\phi(u_t, t, \theta) = \mathcal{G}_\phi(u_t, \gamma(x), E_\psi(\theta), \text{emb}(t))$$

where $\mathcal{G}_\phi$ is the core neural operator with parameters $\phi$, integrating Fourier layers, self-attention mechanisms, and residual connections.

### 3.3 Training Procedure

The training of our DGNO involves a hybrid loss function that balances generative modeling with PDE constraints:

$$\mathcal{L}(\phi, \psi) = \mathcal{L}_\text{score} + \lambda_\text{pde}\mathcal{L}_\text{pde} + \lambda_\text{bc}\mathcal{L}_\text{bc}$$

The score matching loss $\mathcal{L}_\text{score}$ ensures that the network learns to denoise properly:

$$\mathcal{L}_\text{score} = \mathbb{E}_{t, u_0, \theta, \epsilon} \left[ \left\| s_\phi(u_t, t, \theta) - \nabla_{u_t} \log p_t(u_t|u_0, \theta) \right\|^2 \right]$$

where $u_0$ is the true solution and $u_t$ is obtained by applying the forward process to $u_0$.

The PDE residual loss $\mathcal{L}_\text{pde}$ enforces that generated solutions satisfy the differential equation:

$$\mathcal{L}_\text{pde} = \mathbb{E}_{u_\text{gen}, \theta} \left[ \left\| \mathcal{L}_\theta u_\text{gen}(x) - f(x) \right\|^2_\Omega \right]$$

The boundary condition loss $\mathcal{L}_\text{bc}$ ensures that boundary conditions are satisfied:

$$\mathcal{L}_\text{bc} = \mathbb{E}_{u_\text{gen}} \left[ \left\| \mathcal{B}u_\text{gen}(x) - g(x) \right\|^2_{\partial\Omega} \right]$$

We employ a curriculum learning strategy where we gradually increase the weight of the physics-informed losses throughout training:

$$\lambda_\text{pde}(n) = \lambda_\text{pde}^0 \cdot \min(1, n/n_0)$$
$$\lambda_\text{bc}(n) = \lambda_\text{bc}^0 \cdot \min(1, n/n_0)$$

where $n$ is the current training iteration and $n_0$ is a threshold iteration number.

To enhance training efficiency, we utilize:

1. **Importance sampling** for diffusion time $t$ to focus on challenging regions of the diffusion process.
2. **Mixed-precision training** to reduce memory requirements.
3. **Gradient accumulation** for handling large batch sizes.
4. **Progressive dimensionality training** where we start with lower-dimensional versions of the problems and progressively increase dimensionality.

### 3.4 Solving Process

Once trained, our model can generate solutions to new PDEs through the following steps:

1. Sample initial noise $u_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.
2. Given PDE parameters $\theta$, apply the reverse diffusion process using a numerical SDE solver (we use the Predictor-Corrector sampler for its accuracy):

   a. Predictor step: $\hat{u}_{t-\Delta t} = u_t + [\frac{1}{2}\beta(t)u_t - \beta(t)s_\phi(u_t, t, \theta)]\Delta t$
   
   b. Corrector step: $u_{t-\Delta t} = \hat{u}_{t-\Delta t} + \beta(t-\Delta t)\nabla_{u}\log p_{t-\Delta t}(u|\theta)\Delta t + \sqrt{2\beta(t-\Delta t)\Delta t}z$, where $z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$

3. The final solution is given by $u_0$, which approximates the true solution to the PDE.

For applications requiring faster inference, we implement an accelerated sampler based on DDIM (Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models), which enables solution generation in fewer steps.

### 3.5 Experimental Design

We will evaluate our DGNO framework on the following benchmark problems:

1. **High-Dimensional Heat Equation**: 
   $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \Delta u, \quad x \in [0,1]^d, \quad d \in \{10, 50, 100, 500\}$$

2. **High-Dimensional Advection-Diffusion Equation**:
   $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla u = \kappa \Delta u, \quad x \in [0,1]^d, \quad d \in \{10, 50, 100\}$$

3. **Black-Scholes Equation for Multi-Asset Option Pricing**:
   $$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^d \rho_{ij}\sigma_i\sigma_j S_i S_j \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S_i \partial S_j} + r\sum_{i=1}^d S_i \frac{\partial V}{\partial S_i} - rV = 0$$
   with $d \in \{5, 10, 50, 100\}$ assets.

4. **Navier-Stokes Equations in Vorticity Formulation**:
   $$\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \omega = \nu \Delta \omega$$
   with varying Reynolds numbers and boundary conditions.

For each problem, we will compare DGNO against:

1. Traditional numerical methods (where feasible in lower dimensions)
2. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
3. Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)
4. DeepONets
5. Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (without operator learning)

Evaluation metrics include:

1. **Relative L2 Error**: $\varepsilon_2 = \frac{\|u_\text{pred} - u_\text{true}\|_2}{\|u_\text{true}\|_2}$
2. **PDE Residual**: $\varepsilon_\text{res} = \|\mathcal{L}_\theta u_\text{pred} - f\|_2$
3. **Boundary Condition Error**: $\varepsilon_\text{bc} = \|\mathcal{B}u_\text{pred} - g\|_2$
4. **Computational Efficiency**: Training time, inference time, and memory usage
5. **Scalability**: How performance scales with increasing dimensionality

For problems with known analytical solutions, we will use the exact solution as ground truth. For problems without analytical solutions, we will use high-resolution numerical solutions as reference.

Our experimental protocol includes:

1. **Dataset Generation**: For each PDE class, we generate training data by solving the PDEs using high-precision numerical methods for a range of parameters.
2. **Cross-Validation**: We use k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation.
3. **Ablation Studies**: We systematically remove or modify components of our architecture to assess their contribution.
4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: We evaluate the model's robustness to variations in PDE parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions.
