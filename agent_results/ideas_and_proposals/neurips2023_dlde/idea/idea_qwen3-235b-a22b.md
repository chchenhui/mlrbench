1. **Title**: Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Adaptive Sampling for Physics-Informed Neural Networks  
2. **Motivation**: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are promising for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) but struggle with inefficient collocation point selection, leading to slow convergence and poor resolution of discontinuities/steep gradients. Existing static or heuristic sampling methods fail to dynamically prioritize critical regions, limiting scalability to high-dimensional or complex systems.  
3. **Main Idea**: Integrate a reinforcement learning (RL) agent into PINNs to adaptively sample collocation points during training. The RL agent learns a policy to allocate points where the PDE residual or gradient errors are highest, using a graph neural network to model spatial dependencies and a reward function balancing accuracy and computational cost. The agent and PINN are trained end-to-end, enabling real-time adaptation to solution features (e.g., shocks, interfaces). Expected outcomes include reduced training time, lower memory usage, and improved accuracy for challenging PDEs (e.g., turbulent flows, fracture mechanics). This approach bridges the gap between data-driven and physics-based solvers, enabling efficient simulation of high-dimensional systems in climate modeling, materials science, and biomedical engineering.
