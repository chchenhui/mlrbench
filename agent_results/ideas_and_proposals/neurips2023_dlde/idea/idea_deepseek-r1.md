**Title:** Diffusion-Based Neural Solvers for High-Dimensional Partial Differential Equations  

**Motivation:** Solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) is critical in physics, finance, and engineering, but traditional numerical methods struggle with the curse of dimensionality. While neural PDE solvers like PINNs or neural operators show promise, they face scalability and training efficiency challenges. Leveraging the success of diffusion models in high-dimensional generative tasks—rooted in stochastic differential equations (SDEs)—could unlock faster, more accurate solvers for complex, real-world PDEs.  

**Main Idea:** This work proposes a neural PDE solver that integrates diffusion models with PDE constraints. The solver treats the PDE solution as a denoising process, where a learned neural network progressively refines a noisy initial state into the solution. The forward diffusion process incorporates the PDE’s differential operators, enabling a structured noise schedule that aligns with the system’s dynamics. During training, the model learns to reverse this process using a hybrid loss combining score-matching (to guide denoising) and PDE residual terms (to enforce equation constraints). This approach inherently handles high-dimensional domains through diffusion’s scalability and bypasses iterative grid-based computations. Expected outcomes include a unified framework for solving parameterized PDEs with applications to turbulent flow and option pricing, demonstrating superior accuracy and speed compared to PINNs and spectral methods, especially in 100+ dimensions. The impact spans scientific simulations and industrial design, where fast, precise PDE solutions are crucial.
