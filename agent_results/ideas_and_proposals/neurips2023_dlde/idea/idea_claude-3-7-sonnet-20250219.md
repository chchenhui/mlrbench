# Neural Equilibrium Diffusion: Discovering Steady-State Solutions in Complex Systems

## Motivation
Current neural differential equation models excel at capturing dynamic system behaviors but often struggle with equilibrium pointsâ€”those critical states where a system stabilizes. Identifying these equilibrium states is essential in numerous scientific domains, from chemical reaction networks to ecological systems and economic models. Traditional numerical methods for finding these states become computationally intractable in high-dimensional or highly nonlinear systems, while existing machine learning approaches often lack the mathematical guarantees needed for scientific applications.

## Main Idea
We propose Neural Equilibrium Diffusion (NED), a novel framework that combines score-based diffusion models with fixed-point iteration theory to efficiently discover steady-state solutions in complex dynamical systems. NED learns a probability distribution over possible equilibrium states by training a diffusion model whose score function approximates the vector field of the system near equilibria. Unlike conventional approaches, our method doesn't require explicit time integration, making it significantly more efficient. The key innovation is a specialized loss function that incorporates both the vanishing dynamics condition at equilibrium points and stability properties, enabling the model to distinguish between stable and unstable equilibria. NED can handle systems with multiple equilibria and identify previously unknown steady states in high-dimensional systems. We demonstrate its efficacy on challenging problems in systems biology, fluid dynamics, and chemical reaction networks, showing improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy.
