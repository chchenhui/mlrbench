**Title:** Federated Explainability: Generating Local Explanations Without Sharing Sensitive Data

**Motivation:** Applying XAI in sensitive domains like healthcare or finance is crucial for trust and debugging, but sharing raw data to generate explanations centrally poses significant privacy risks. Existing XAI methods often require access to data or model parameters, hindering their use in privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) scenarios.

**Main Idea:** This research proposes "Federated Explainability," a novel framework enabling collaborative generation of local model explanations (e.g., SHAP, LIME) in an FL setting without sharing local data. Each client would compute explanation components locally using its private data and the global model. These components (e.g., gradients, perturbation results, distilled simpler models) would be securely aggregated (using techniques like secure aggregation or differential privacy) at the server to generate representative local explanations for specific instances or aggregated explanations reflecting global trends, without revealing sensitive client data. Expected outcomes include privacy-preserving XAI tools that enhance transparency in FL systems, crucial for auditing and user trust in sensitive applications.
