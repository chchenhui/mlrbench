    - **Year**: 2024

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Translation of Natural Language to Formal Specifications**: Accurately converting natural language descriptions into formal specifications or SMT constraints remains complex due to ambiguities and the need for precise logical representations.

2. **Handling Complex Data Structures**: Symbolic execution and formal verification tools often struggle with complex or dynamically typed data structures, limiting their applicability to languages like Python.

3. **Scalability of Verification Methods**: Formal verification techniques can be computationally intensive, making them less practical for large-scale or real-time code generation tasks.

4. **Integration of LLMs with Formal Methods**: Creating effective feedback loops between LLMs and formal verification tools is challenging, requiring seamless communication and understanding between probabilistic models and deterministic solvers.

5. **Ensuring Correctness in Self-Correction Mechanisms**: While self-correction approaches show promise, ensuring that LLMs can reliably identify and rectify their errors without external feedback is still an open challenge.
