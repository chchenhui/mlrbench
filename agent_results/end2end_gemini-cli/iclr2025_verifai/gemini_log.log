Okay, I will now begin designing and executing the experimental plan.

First, I need to understand the project context by reading the provided markdown files. I will start with `task.md` to grasp the overall objective.## Submission Guidelines
Submissions should be in the ICLR style format, with a maximum length of 5 pages, excluding references and appendices. All submissions will be peer-reviewed in a double-blind process. Accepted papers will be presented as posters, with some selected for oral presentations.

## Important Dates
- Submission Deadline: February 28, 2025
- Notification of Acceptance: March 28, 2025
- Workshop Date: April 25, 2025

Based on my analysis of the provided documents, I have formulated a comprehensive experimental plan. The core hypothesis is that using an SMT solver to find bugs and generate targeted feedback (SMT-Repair) will correct LLM-generated code more effectively than using standard unit test feedback (UT-Repair) or no feedback at all (Zero-Shot).

I will now proceed with the implementation. The first step is to create the necessary directory structure and files for the experiment.I will now create the `gemini/README.md` and `gemini/requirements.txt` files. The README will provide an overview and instructions, while the requirements file will list the necessary Python packages for the experiment.Next, I will create the initial Python scripts for the experimental framework. I will start by creating empty files, which I will populate with the necessary logic in subsequent steps.I have defined the core modules. Now I will create the main script to run the experiment, `scripts/run_experiment.py`, and a placeholder for the plotting script, `scripts/plot_results.py`.All the necessary scripts have been created. I will now install the dependencies and then execute the main experiment script. This will run the full pipeline, log the process, save the results, and generate the plots.The experiment script executed successfully, but the plotting failed because the `seaborn` package was missing. The raw results have been saved. I will now add `seaborn` to the requirements, install it, and then generate the plots.The plots have been generated successfully. Now that all experimental artifacts are ready, I will analyze the results and create the final `results.md` report.I made an error in the file path. The results are in the `results` directory at the project root, not inside the `gemini` directory. I will now read the CSV from the correct location to proceed with the analysis.Based on the analysis of the experimental data, I will now generate the final `results.md` file. This report will summarize the experiment, present the findings in tables and figures, and provide a discussion of the results, limitations, and future work.I have generated the `results.md` report. As per the final step of the instructions, I will now ensure all specified artifacts (`results.md`, `log.txt`, and the generated figures) are correctly placed in the `results` directory and then perform a final cleanup of any large temporary files.My apologies for the error in the previous step. I have located the files correctly now. I will consolidate all the generated artifacts and source code into the `results` directory as intended.The move command failed because the destination directories already exist. I will now list the contents of the `results` directory to verify its state before proceeding with a corrected cleanup and consolidation plan.It appears the consolidation commands I issued earlier partially succeeded, leaving the `results` directory in the desired final state. My only remaining tasks are to remove the now-redundant `gemini` directory and then clear any large cached data to complete the cleanup.The `gemini` directory is now removed. I will proceed with the final cleanup step: removing the cached Hugging Face dataset to ensure no large files remain.
I have completed all the steps requested by the user.

1.  **Experimental Design and Implementation**: I designed an experiment based on the provided documents, created a `gemini` folder, and wrote Python scripts to automate the process.
2.  **Execution and Logging**: I ran the experiment, which involved interacting with the OpenAI API and the `crosshair` SMT tool. The entire process was logged to `log.txt`.
3.  **Results and Analysis**: The results were saved to a CSV file, and plots were generated to visualize the outcomes. I created a detailed `results.md` file analyzing the findings, discussing the limitations, and suggesting future work.
4.  **Finalization and Cleanup**: I consolidated all the project files (source code, scripts, results, logs, figures, and reports) into a single `results` directory and removed temporary files and the cached dataset.

The project is now complete and self-contained in the `results` directory. I am now finished with the task.
