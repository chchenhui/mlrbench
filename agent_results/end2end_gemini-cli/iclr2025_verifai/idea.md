**Title:** Neuro-Symbolic Repair: Correcting LLM-Generated Code via SMT-Informed Self-Correction

**Motivation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate syntactically correct code that still contains subtle logical flaws or fails on edge cases. While formal verification can detect such issues, existing automated repair techniques are often computationally expensive and lack the contextual understanding of the LLM. This research aims to create an efficient, synergistic feedback loop that leverages the precision of formal methods to intelligently guide the LLM's own powerful repair capabilities.

**Main Idea:** We propose a framework where LLM-generated code is verified against formal specifications (which can be user-provided or inferred from tests) using an SMT solver. When a violation is found, instead of triggering a complex symbolic repair engine, the SMT solver's counterexample is translated into a concise natural language prompt. For instance, a counterexample `(x=MAX_INT, y=1)` causing an integer overflow would be translated to "The function fails with an overflow when `x` is the maximum integer value and `y` is 1." This targeted, human-readable feedback is then given to the original LLM, prompting it to perform a self-correction. This neuro-symbolic approach promises more robust code generation by combining the bug-finding precision of solvers with the LLM's contextual-reasoning and code-writing abilities.
