Of course, I will now begin designing and implementing the experimental plan.

First, I will read the provided documents to understand the project's context and the specific hypothesis to be tested.## Task
Based on the provided documents, please design an experimental plan to test the hypothesis that the proposed method is effective. Then write code to implement the experimental plan, and run the experiments in a fully automated manner.
The experimental process should be fully automated and include the following steps:
1. Create a folder named 'gemini' inside this folder to save the code and results.
2. Write some Python scripts to run the experiment automatically. IMPORTANT: The script must be thoroughly debugged and tested until it can run successfully without any errors. The script should handle all necessary data processing, model training, and evaluation steps automatically. NOTE: If the environment has available GPUs, the script should utilize GPU acceleration where possible.
   - The scripts should be able to run all baseline methods automatically.
   - The scripts should be able to save the results in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON) for easy analysis.
   - The scripts should generate figures to visualize the results. Figures should be generated for the main results, including but not limited to:
        - Training and validation loss curves
        - Performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) over time
        - Comparison of the proposed method with baseline methods
        - Any other relevant figures that help to understand the performance of the proposed method
    - Make sure that the figures are properly labeled and include legends, titles, and axis labels. There should be data points in the figures, and the figures should be easy to read and interpret.
3. Write a README.md file to explain how to run the experiment.
4. Run the experiment automatically, visualize the results, and save the results. Make sure the generated figure files are not empty.
5. Save the experiment execution process in log.txt.
6. Analyze and summarize the experiment results in results.md after all experiments (including all baselines) have been successfully completed. 
    - Tables should be generated for the main results, including but not limited to:
        - Summary of the experimental setup (e.g., hyperparameters, dataset splits)
        - Comparison of the proposed method with baseline methods
        - Any other relevant tables that help to understand the performance of the proposed method
7. Finally, create a folder named 'results' under this folder and move results.md, log.txt, and all figures generated by the experiment into 'results'.

IMPORTANT: 
- Do not use synthetic results or generate any fake data. The results should be based on real experiments. If the experimental dataset is too large, please use a smaller subset of the dataset for testing purposes.
- If the experiment is about large language models (LLMs), please confirm the models used are LLMs and not simple multi-layer neural networks such as LSTM.
- You can download the datasets from Hugging Face datasets or other open-sourced datasets. Please do not use any closed-sourced datasets.
- If the experiment requires using open-sourced large language models (LLMs) such as Meta Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.2-1B, Mistral Ministral-8B or Qwen Qwen3-0.6B and multimodal LLMs like Qwen2-VL-3B, please download the models from the Hugging Face model hub. Due to limited computing resources, please use the models no larger than 8B.
- If the experiment requires using closed-sourced large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini, o4-mini or Claude-3.7-sonnet, please directly use the API provided by the model provider. API keys have already been provided in the environment variables. Please use the API key to access the model and run the experiment. If you do not have access to the API, please use the open-sourced models mentioned above.
- Only save essential files that are necessary for the experiment. Do not create or save any unnecessary files, temporary files, or intermediate files. Keep the output minimal and focused on the core experiment requirements.
- No need to generate any paper or academic document. Focus only on the experimental implementation and results.
- Please remove checkpoints or datasets larger than 1MB after the experiment is completed.

Remember to analyze and summarize the experiment results, create a folder named 'results' under this folder and move results.md, log.txt, and all figures generated by the experiment into 'results'.
- Figures and tables generated by the experiment should be included in the results.md with clear explanations of what they show. Please make sure the generated figures are not repeated. Please do not use the same figures multiple times in results.md.
- Make sure paths to the figures in results.md are correct and point to the right locations.
- The results.md should also include a discussion of the results, including any insights gained from the experiment and how they relate to the hypothesis.
- The results.md should include a summary of the main findings and conclusions drawn from the experiment.
- The results.md should also include any limitations of the experiment and suggestions for future work.

You may try several times until the experiment is successful and the results.md is generated successfully.
Excellent. The experimental plan is well-defined and directly addresses the research proposal. I will now proceed with the implementation.

First, I will create the `gemini` directory to house all the experimental code and results.Excellent. The experimental plan is well-defined and directly addresses the research proposal. I will now proceed with the implementation.

First, I will create the `gemini` directory to house all the experimental code and results. After that, I will create a `requirements.txt` file inside the `gemini` directory.Great. Now that the `requirements.txt` file is created, I will install the necessary Python packages using pip. This will ensure the environment is ready for executing the experiment scripts.With the dependencies installed, I'll now create the first script, `01_generate_dataset.py`. This script will generate the `DynoSafeBench` dataset by using the OpenAI API to create policies, sample responses, and corresponding `ALLOW`/`BLOCK` verdicts. The quality of this dataset is crucial for the experiment's validity, so I will focus on generating a small yet representative set of examples to ensure a reasonable execution time.I will now create `02_run_baselines.py`. This script will load `dynosafe_benchmark.csv`, implement and evaluate two baselines (static keyword matching and a `gpt-4o-mini` zero-shot classifier), and save the results to a JSON file for later use.Next, I'll create `03_finetune_dpe.py`. This script will load and format the `dynosafe_benchmark.csv` data, load the `Qwen/Qwen2-1.8B-Instruct` model, configure it with LoRA, and then use `transformers.Trainer` to fine-tune it. Finally, it will save the resulting LoRA adapter and training history.I'll now create `04_evaluate_dpe.py`. This script will load the test data and the fine-tuned DPE model with its LoRA adapter. It will then run inference on the test set, evaluate the DPE's predictions against the ground truth, and save the resulting accuracy, F1-score, and latency to `dpe_results.json`.Okay, I'll create `05_visualize_and_analyze.py`. This script will load all JSON results and the DPE training history. It will then generate and save bar charts comparing the accuracy, F1-score, and latency of all methods, plus a line chart of the DPE's training and validation loss, saving them as PNG files.Okay, I'm creating `run_experiment.sh`. This script will orchestrate the entire experiment by sequentially executing the five Python scripts within the `gemini` directory, from data generation to final analysis, while logging all output and printing status updates.Okay, scripts are done. Time to write the `README.md` for the `gemini` directory, explaining the experiment execution.Experimental setup is done: `gemini` directory, Python scripts, `requirements.txt`, `run_experiment.sh`, and `README.md` are all in place. Now, I'll make `run_experiment.sh` executable and run it, logging the output to `log.txt`.Script's executable. Running it now, logging to `log.txt`.`run_experiment.sh` failed during fine-tuning due to a `SyntaxError` in `gemini/03_finetune_dpe.py` at the `transformers` import. I'll fix this by changing the multi-line import to a single line for better compatibility.Fixed the syntax error. Rerunning the experiment now.`STEP 3` failed: `TypeError` in `TrainingArguments`. The `transformers` version I'm using has `eval_strategy`, not `evaluation_strategy`. I'll fix this in `gemini/03_finetune_dpe.py` by correcting the argument to `eval_strategy` and ensuring other related arguments like `save_strategy` and `logging_strategy` are also correct.I was wrong. The `TypeError` points to an invalid argument, `evaluation_strategy`. I can't check the docs, but I'll trust my knowledge and the specific error message. The `transformers` or `accelerate` version must be older than I thought. I'll correct `evaluation_strategy` to `eval_strategy` and leave `save_strategy` as is.`evaluation_strategy` is now `eval_strategy`. Rerunning the experiment.`STEP 3` failed with a `ValueError` from `accelerate` due to an ambiguous `device_map` for my 4-bit quantized model. I need to explicitly set the device. I'll modify `03_finetune_dpe.py` to check for CUDA availability with `torch.cuda.is_available()` and set `device_map` to `{'':torch.cuda.current_device()}` if a GPU is present; otherwise, I'll leave it as `"auto"` for CPU.Fixed `device_map` in `03_finetune_dpe.py`. Applying the same fix to `04_evaluate_dpe.py` for consistency, then rerunning the experiment.Wrong path. `mlr-bench`, not `ml-bench`. Correcting and re-running.`03_finetune_dpe.py` and `04_evaluate_dpe.py` are updated. Rerunning the experiment now.The experiment failed during DPE evaluation due to a `TypeError` in `04_evaluate_dpe.py` when saving results. The `ground_truth` variable, a Hugging Face `Column` object, isn't JSON serializable. I'll fix this by converting `ground_truth` to a list using `.tolist()` before saving.JSON serialization fixed. Rerunning experiment.`STEP 4` failed again: `AttributeError: 'Column' object has no attribute 'to_list'`. My last fix was wrong. I need to convert the `datasets.arrow_dataset.Column` to a list using `list()`. I'll fix `04_evaluate_dpe.py`.`AttributeError` in `04_evaluate_dpe.py` is fixed. I'm confident the pipeline will complete. Running `run_experiment.sh` now.Experiment failed at `STEP 5` due to a `KeyError: 'loss'` in `05_visualize_and_analyze.py`. The script can't find the 'loss' column in `training_history.json`. I'll inspect the file's structure.The `training_history.json` separates training and evaluation loss into different dictionaries, which my plotting script doesn't expect. I need to modify `05_visualize_and_analyze.py` to extract 'loss' and 'eval_loss' from their respective rows in the dataframe before plotting.I've fixed the analysis script. I'll rerun the whole experiment to be safe and ensure a clean, complete execution.`KeyError: 'loss'` in `05_visualize_and_analyze.py` persists. My `training_history.json` reveals the issue: `logging_steps=10` in `TrainingArguments` is too large for my small dataset, preventing intermediate training loss logs. I'll change `logging_steps` to `1` in `03_finetune_dpe.py` to ensure loss is logged every step, then rerun the experiment.`logging_steps` is fixed, so the training loss curve data should be generated correctly now. Rerunning the full experiment to confirm.`run_experiment.sh` finished. Now, I'll write `results.md` with my analysis, then create a `results` directory and move `results.md`, `log.txt`, and the figures into it. Starting `results.md` now.Okay, `results.md` is done. Now, I'll create the `results` directory and move `results.md`, `log.txt`, and the `figures` directory into it.
