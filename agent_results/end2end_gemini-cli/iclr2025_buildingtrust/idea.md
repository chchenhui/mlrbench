**Title:** Dynamic Policy Enforcers: Adaptive Guardrails for Trustworthy LLM Applications

**Motivation:** Static, hard-coded guardrails for LLMs are brittle. They fail to adapt to evolving regulations, emerging threats, and context-specific safety requirements, forcing slow and costly model retraining. This lag creates significant trust and compliance risks for real-world applications. A more agile solution is needed to ensure LLMs can operate safely within dynamic environments.

**Main Idea:** We propose a framework using a smaller, specialized LLM as a real-time "policy enforcer" that monitors and validates the output of a primary, large-capability LLM. This enforcer model is trained to interpret and apply safety policies provided as natural language text at inference time. Instead of retraining to update rules, system administrators can simply revise the enforcer's policy prompt. This allows for instantaneous, zero-shot adaptation to new guidelines (e.g., updated legal standards, platform-specific content rules). This research will focus on creating a robust policy enforcer and a benchmark to evaluate its ability to dynamically adapt, leading to more trustworthy and perpetually compliant LLM systems.
