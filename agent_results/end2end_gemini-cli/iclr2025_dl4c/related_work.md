**Key Challenges:**

1. **Sparse and Non-Informative Feedback**: Traditional alignment techniques often rely on binary execution feedback (pass/fail), which lacks detailed information on the causes of code failures, limiting the model's ability to learn from errors.

2. **Complexity of Execution Traces**: Incorporating detailed execution traces into the training process introduces complexity, as the model must effectively interpret and utilize this rich, structured data to improve code generation.

3. **Generalization Across Diverse Codebases**: Ensuring that models fine-tuned with execution traces can generalize across various programming languages and codebases remains a significant challenge, requiring extensive and diverse training data.

4. **Balancing Model Efficiency and Performance**: Integrating execution-aware feedback mechanisms may increase computational overhead, necessitating strategies to balance model efficiency with enhanced performance.

5. **Evaluation and Benchmarking**: Developing standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of execution-trace alignment techniques is crucial for measuring progress and comparing different approaches.
