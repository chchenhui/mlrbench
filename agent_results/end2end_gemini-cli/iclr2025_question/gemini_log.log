Of course, I will now begin designing and implementing the experimental plan.

First, I will read the provided documents to understand the project's context and goals. After that, I will create a detailed experimental plan and implement it. The entire process will be automated, and I will keep you updated on my progress.

I will start by reading `task.md`, `idea.md`, `related_work.md`, and `proposal.md`.The workshop will feature a combination of invited talks from leading researchers, contributed talks, and a poster session. We will also host a panel discussion on the future of uncertainty quantification in AI, bringing together experts from academia and industry to debate the most pressing challenges and opportunities.

We welcome submissions on a wide range of topics related to uncertainty quantification in foundation models, including but not limited to:

- Bayesian deep learning for generative models
- Ensemble methods for uncertainty estimation
- Conformal prediction and other distribution-free UQ methods
- Uncertainty-aware retrieval-augmented generation
- Detecting and mitigating hallucinations
- Out-of-distribution detection and open-set recognition
- Uncertainty in multimodal and diffusion models
- Human-in-the-loop systems for uncertainty-aware AI
- Applications of UQ in high-stakes domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, law)
- Benchmarks and datasets for evaluating uncertainty in foundation models
- Theoretical analysis of uncertainty in deep generative models
- Cognitive science and HCI perspectives on communicating uncertainty

Join us in advancing the frontier of reliable AI by tackling the critical challenge of quantifying uncertainty in foundation models. Together, we can build a future where AI systems are not only powerful but also trustworthy, transparent, and aligned with human values.
This is an excellent and well-defined research proposal. I will now proceed with the implementation of the experimental plan.

Here is the plan:

### Experimental Plan

**1. Hypothesis:**
The core hypothesis is that a model trained to disentangle epistemic (model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) uncertainty can more effectively identify factual hallucinations (which should correlate with high epistemic uncertainty) while preserving performance on creative tasks (which are characterized by high aleatoric uncertainty), compared to models using a single, undifferentiated uncertainty metric.

**2. Dataset:**
To test this, I will construct the **Disentangled Uncertainty Dataset (DUnD)** by combining two existing datasets from Hugging Face:
*   **Factual (Low Aleatoric Uncertainty):** A subset of the `truthful_qa` dataset (generation task) will be used. These are questions with known, factual answers.
*   **Creative (High Aleatoric Uncertainty):** A subset of the `databricks/databricks-dolly-15k` dataset will be used, specifically filtering for open-ended and creative tasks like brainstorming and story generation.

For evaluation, I will use the multiple-choice version of `truthful_qa` to provide a clear, objective measure of hallucination detection.

**3. Models:**
To ensure the experiment is computationally feasible, I will use `Qwen/Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct` as the base model. It is a powerful and efficient instruction-tuned model suitable for fine-tuning.

I will implement and compare the following models:
*   **Proposed Model (DUnE-LLM):** The Qwen2 model fine-tuned with the proposed architecture, featuring separate heads for token prediction and disentangled uncertainty prediction ($\hat{U}_E$ and $\hat{U}_A$).
*   **Baseline 1 (Token-level Entropy):** A fine-tuned Qwen2 model where uncertainty is measured by the Shannon entropy of the next-token probability distribution.
*   **Baseline 2 (MC Dropout):** A fine-tuned Qwen2 model with dropout layers activated during inference. Uncertainty is measured by the variance across multiple forward passes.

**4. Automated Workflow:**
The entire experiment will be automated by a series of Python scripts:
1.  **Setup:** Create a `gemini` directory, and install all required dependencies (`pytorch`, `transformers`, `datasets`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`).
2.  **Data Preparation:** Download, process, and combine the datasets to create the DUnD for training and evaluation.
3.  **Training:** Fine-tune the baseline models and train the DUnE-LLM on the DUnD.
4.  **Evaluation:**
    *   Assess hallucination detection performance on `truthful_qa` using the AUROC metric.
    *   Evaluate the ability of each model to distinguish between factual and creative contexts on a held-out test set.
    *   Save all quantitative results.
5.  **Visualization:** Generate and save plots comparing model performance, including loss curves and AUROC scores.
6.  **Reporting:**
    *   Generate a final `results.md` file summarizing the methodology, results, and conclusions, with embedded tables and figures.
    *   Create a `results` directory and move the `results.md` file, all generated figures, and the execution log (`log.txt`) into it.
7.  **Cleanup:** Automatically remove large files, such as downloaded datasets and model checkpoints, after the experiment concludes.

I will now begin by creating the `gemini` directory for the project.Next, I will create the Python script `gemini/main.py`, which will serve as the main entry point for running the entire experiment. This script will orchestrate the data preparation, model training, evaluation, and reporting steps.Now, I will create the core script, `gemini/run_experiment.py`. This script will contain the primary logic for the experiment, including data loading, model definition, training, evaluation, and visualization. This approach keeps the project organized and allows for a clear separation of concerns.Next, I will create the `README.md` file inside the `gemini` directory. This file will provide clear instructions on how to set up the environment and run the experiment, ensuring the project is reproducible.I have now set up the complete experimental environment. All the necessary scripts (`main.py`, `run_experiment.py`) and the `README.md` are in place.

The next step is to execute the experiment. I will run the `main.py` script, which will handle everything automatically: dependency installation, data preparation, model training, evaluation, and generation of the final results.

I will now start the experiment.The experiment failed due to a `NameError: name 'sys' is not defined` in `run_experiment.py`. I forgot to import the `sys` module before using it.

I will now correct the script by adding `import sys` at the beginning of `gemini/run_experiment.py`.I have fixed the `NameError` by adding the missing `import sys` statement.

Now, I will re-run the experiment.The experiment has completed successfully!

All the required steps have been executed:
1.  The environment was set up, and dependencies were installed.
2.  The DUnD dataset was created by combining factual and creative data.
3.  The baseline models (Token Entropy, MC Dropout) and the proposed DUnE model were trained.
4.  The models were evaluated on the hallucination detection task.
5.  All results, including a summary markdown file, figures, and logs, have been generated and saved in the `gemini/results` directory.

I will now move the `gemini/results` directory to the project root as requested by the user.I have successfully moved the `results` directory to the project root. The experiment is now complete, and all the requested artifacts have been generated and organized as specified.

Final check of the `results` directory contents:
- `results.md`: Contains the summary of the experiment, including the setup, results table, analysis, and the generated figure.
- `log.txt`: The complete log of the experimental run.
- `hallucination_detection_auroc.png`: The bar chart comparing the AUROC scores of the different models.
- `experiment_results.json`: The raw JSON output of the experiment metrics.

The task is now complete.
