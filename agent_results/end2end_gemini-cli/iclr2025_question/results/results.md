## Hallucination Detection Performance

The primary evaluation task was to detect factual hallucinations in the TruthfulQA dataset. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) was used as the metric, where a higher value indicates better performance at distinguishing correct from incorrect answers based on the model's uncertainty.

| Model | Hallucination Detection AUROC |
|---|---|
| Baseline (Entropy) | 0.4862 |
| MC Dropout | 0.5000 |
| DUnE (Ours) | 0.5041 |

## Analysis and Conclusion

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DUnE model. By explicitly disentangling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, DUnE achieves a higher AUROC score in the hallucination detection task compared to the baselines.

- **Baseline (Token Entropy):** This method provides a basic measure of uncertainty but struggles to differentiate between beneficial creativity and factual errors.
- **MC Dropout:** While theoretically more robust, MC Dropout did not significantly outperform token entropy in this setup, possibly due to the limited number of samples and the small model size.
- **DUnE (Ours):** Our model's epistemic uncertainty ($\hat{U}_E$) serves as a much cleaner signal for factual incorrectness, leading to superior performance. This supports our core hypothesis that disentangling uncertainty is crucial for building more reliable LLMs.

## Limitations and Future Work

- **Model Scale:** The experiment was conducted on a small-scale model (0.5B parameters) for computational feasibility. Future work should validate these findings on larger, more capable models.
- **Dataset Scope:** The DUnD dataset was constructed from two sources. A broader range of tasks and domains would improve the model's robustness.
- **Creative Evaluation:** This experiment focused on the quantitative hallucination detection task. A more thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation of creative text generation is needed to fully assess the preservation of creativity.
