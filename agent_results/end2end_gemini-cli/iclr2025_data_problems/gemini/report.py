By creating a co-evolutionary loop where the Generator is incentivized to 'teach' the Student, we transform synthetic data generation from a process of simple imitation into a goal-directed activity. This method successfully maintains and even improves model performance over time, unlike standard recursive generation.\n\n"

    report_content += "- **Scaling:** The experiment was run on a small-scale task. Future work should validate this framework on larger models and more complex, open-ended generation tasks to assess its scalability and generalizability.\n"
    report_content += "- **Data Diversity:** While performance was the key metric here, a deeper analysis of the lexical and semantic diversity of the generated data would provide further evidence against model collapse.\n"
