### Project Summary

*   **Problem:** Training foundation models (FMs) on their own synthetic data leads to "model collapse," where the model's performance and the data's diversity degrade over successive generations. Current solutions rely on mixing in real data, which is a finite resource and has privacy/copyright concerns.
*   **Proposed Solution:** A "Generative Data Symbiosis" framework. This involves two models: a **Generator** (a large LLM) and a **Student** (a smaller LLM). Instead of just mimicking a static dataset, the Generator is trained to produce data that specifically helps the Student learn. The Student's performance and areas of weakness (e.g., high uncertainty on certain topics) provide feedback to the Generator, which then creates more targeted and helpful data. This co-evolutionary loop is hypothesized to prevent model collapse.
*   **Hypothesis:** The Generative Data Symbiosis framework can mitigate model collapse, leading to sustained or improved performance in the Student model, unlike traditional recursive training methods which cause a rapid decline.

### Experimental Plan

I will now implement a fully automated experiment to test this hypothesis.

1.  **Setup:**
    *   Create a `gemini` directory for all code and results.
    *   The experiment will be orchestrated by a main Python script.
    *   I will use PyTorch and the Hugging Face `transformers` and `datasets` libraries. The code will automatically use a GPU if `torch.cuda.is_available()` is true.

2.  **Models & Data:**
    *   **Generator:** I will use a smaller, more manageable model than Llama-3-8B for this initial experiment to ensure it runs efficiently, for example, `Qwen/Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct`. This still captures the essence of an instruction-following LLM.
    *   **Student:** As proposed, a smaller LLM like `EleutherAI/pythia-1b` will be used.
    *   **Dataset:** I will use the `ag_news` dataset, a standard text classification task. It's small, well-understood, and perfect for demonstrating the core idea without excessive computational cost. The goal is to use the Generator to create synthetic training data for the Student, which will then be evaluated on the real `ag_news` test set.

3.  **Methodology:**
    *   I will implement four experimental conditions as described in the proposal:
        1.  **Recursive Collapse (Baseline):** The Student is trained on data generated by the previous iteration's Student. This is the negative control.
        2.  **Static Synthetic (Baseline):** The initial Generator creates a fixed dataset. The Student is trained on subsets of this static data.
        3.  **Real Data Upper Bound (Baseline):** The Student is trained on real data from the `ag_news` training set. This is the performance ceiling.
        4.  **Generative Symbiosis (Proposed Method):** The full co-evolutionary loop. The Generator will create data based on the Student's weaknesses (identified by high loss on a held-out part of the training set).

4.  **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Scripts:** I will create modular Python scripts:
        *   `run_experiment.py`: The main script to orchestrate the entire experiment.
        *   `data_utils.py`: To handle loading and preprocessing of the `ag_news` dataset.
        *   `models.py`: To define the Student model and the logic for training and evaluation.
        *   `generation.py`: To handle data generation from the Generator LLM.
        *   `plotting.py`: To create visualizations from the results.
        *   `report.py`: To generate the final `results.md`.
    *   **Automation:** The `run_experiment.py` script will execute all four conditions, save results to a JSON file, and then call the plotting and report generation scripts. The entire process will be logged to `log.txt`.
    *   **Results:** The experiment will track the Student's accuracy on the `ag_news` test set over several "generations" or training iterations. Loss curves will also be saved.

5.  **Final Output:**
    *   A `gemini` directory containing all the code.
    *   A `log.txt` file detailing the execution.
    *   A `results` directory containing:
        *   `results.md`: A full report with analysis, tables, and figures.
        *   `accuracy_comparison.png`: A plot comparing the accuracy of all four methods over time.
        *   `loss_curves.png`: A plot showing training/validation loss for the symbiotic method.

I will now begin by creating the necessary directories and files.Okay, the directories are created. Now, I will write the `README.md` file to explain how to run the experiment.Next, I will write the Python code for the experiment. I'll start with the data utilities script.Now, I'll write the `generation.py` script to handle the synthetic data generation process. This is a key part of the proposed method.Next, I'll create the `models.py` script. This will contain the Student model definition, training loop, evaluation logic, and the method for finding "hard" examples for the symbiotic loop.Now I'll write the plotting utility script. This will be responsible for generating the figures for the final report.Now I will write the `report.py` script, which will be responsible for analyzing the results from the JSON file and generating the final `results.md` markdown file.Finally, I will write the main orchestration script, `run_experiment.py`. This script will tie everything together, run all the experimental conditions, and generate the final results.

This is a large and complex script, so I will be careful to structure it logically. It will handle the main loop for each of the four methods, call the appropriate functions for data generation, training, and evaluation, and save the results.

Due to the potential for long run times, I've kept the number of generations and epochs low in the default config. I've also selected smaller models (`Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct` and `EleutherAI/pythia-160m`) to ensure the experiment can complete in a reasonable amount of time.All the necessary scripts have been created. I will now install the required dependencies and then execute the main experiment script. This will run the full automated pipeline.Dependencies are installed. Now, I will execute the experiment. This will be a long-running process, and all output will be logged to `log.txt`. After this step is complete, the `results` directory should contain the final report, figures, and log file.The experiment failed with a `ValueError` related to NumPy's `copy` keyword. This is a known issue with the recent NumPy 2.0 release, which makes the `copy` keyword stricter. The error originates within the `datasets` library, which is calling `np.array(..., copy=False)`.

The error message suggests replacing `np.array(obj, copy=False)` with `np.asarray(obj)`. Since the error is in a dependency, I cannot directly edit the library code.

However, I can fix this by downgrading NumPy to a version before 2.0. Version 1.26.4 is a safe choice. I will first uninstall the current NumPy and then install the older version. After that, I will rerun the experiment.Now that NumPy has been downgraded to a compatible version, I will rerun the experiment.The experiment failed again, this time with an `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'to'`. This error occurs during the evaluation of the student model. It means that some of the data being passed to the model is a string, when it should be a tensor.

Looking at the traceback, the error is in `models.py` at the line `input_ids, attention_mask, labels = [b.to(device) for b in batch]`. This indicates that the `batch` object, which should be a list or tuple of tensors, contains a string.

This usually happens when the `DataLoader` is not correctly configured or when the dataset itself has issues. I'll examine `data_utils.py` and `models.py` to trace how the data is being formatted and passed.

The most likely cause is that the `set_format` call in `data_utils.py` is not being correctly applied or is being overridden.

Let me check the `data_utils.py` script again.

```python
# data_utils.py

# ... (imports)

def get_data(config):
    # ... (loading dataset and tokenizer)
    
    # ... (selecting subsets)

    def tokenize_function(examples):
        return tokenizer(examples["text"], padding="max_length", truncation=True, max_length=config["max_seq_length"])

    train_dataset = dataset["train"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(train_size))
    validation_dataset = dataset["train"].shuffle(seed=24).select(range(train_size, train_size + val_size))
    test_dataset = dataset["test"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(test_size))

    train_dataset = train_dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
    validation_dataset = validation_dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
    test_dataset = test_dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

    train_dataset.set_format(type='torch', columns=['input_ids', 'attention_mask', 'label'])
    validation_dataset.set_format(type='torch', columns=['input_ids', 'attention_mask', 'label'])
    test_dataset.set_format(type='torch', columns=['input_ids', 'attention_mask', 'label'])

    train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=config["batch_size"])
    validation_dataloader = DataLoader(validation_dataset, batch_size=config["batch_size"])
    test_dataloader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=config["batch_size"])
    
    return train_dataloader, validation_dataloader, test_dataloader, tokenizer
```

The `get_data` function seems to correctly set the format for `train_dataset`, `validation_dataset`, and `test_dataset`. However, the error is happening during the initial evaluation, before any training has occurred. This points to an issue with how the `test_loader` is created or used.

The error `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'to'` strongly suggests that the `batch` is not what's expected. A `DataLoader` on a `datasets` object should yield batches of tensors. If it's yielding strings, something is wrong with the data pipeline.

Let's look at the `find_hard_examples` function in `models.py`. It also iterates through a dataloader.

```python
# models.py
def find_hard_examples(model, dataloader, tokenizer, device, num_examples=50):
    # ...
    with torch.no_grad():
        for batch in dataloader:
            # ...
            # Decode texts to get the original strings
            texts = [tokenizer.decode(ids, skip_special_tokens=True) for ids in input_ids]
            original_texts.extend(texts)
            # ...
```
This part of the code decodes the tensors back to text, which is correct for its purpose.

The error is in `evaluate_student`. Let's re-read the traceback. The error is in `run_experiment.py` calling `evaluate_student`.

The problem might be in how the dataloaders are being created. The `datasets` library can be tricky.

I see the problem. In `data_utils.py`, I am shuffling and selecting from the dataset *before* mapping the tokenize function. This is correct. Then I set the format. This is also correct.

Let's look at `create_synthetic_dataloader`.
```python
# data_utils.py
def create_synthetic_dataloader(synthetic_texts, labels, tokenizer, config):
    """
    Creates a DataLoader from synthetic text data.
    """
    encodings = tokenizer(synthetic_texts, padding="max_length", truncation=True, max_length=config["max_seq_length"], return_tensors="pt")
    dataset = TensorDataset(encodings['input_ids'], encodings['attention_mask'], torch.tensor(labels))
    return DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=config["batch_size"])
```
This function correctly creates a `TensorDataset`, which is then wrapped in a `DataLoader`. This should produce batches of tensors.

The error is happening on the first call to `evaluate_student`, which uses `test_loader`. This dataloader is created in `get_data`.

Let's re-examine the `get_data` function.
The `map` function is applied, and then `set_format`. This seems correct.

Let me re-read the error message carefully. `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'to'`. This means `b` is a string in `[b.to(device) for b in batch]`.

A `DataLoader` wrapping a `Dataset` object from the `datasets` library, with format set to 'torch', should yield a dictionary of tensors. The code in `models.py` assumes the batch is a list/tuple of tensors. This is the mismatch.

The batch from a `datasets` `DataLoader` is a dictionary. I need to change the code in `train_student`, `evaluate_student`, and `find_hard_examples` to handle dictionary batches.

The batch should look like `{'input_ids': tensor, 'attention_mask': tensor, 'label': tensor}`.

I will correct the code in `models.py`.

**Plan:**
1.  Modify `train_student`, `evaluate_student`, and `find_hard_examples` in `models.py` to correctly handle dictionary batches from the `datasets` library's `DataLoader`.
2.  Rerun the experiment.

Here is the change for `models.py`:The experiment failed with an `AttributeError`, indicating that the data being passed to the model is a string instead of a tensor. This is because the `DataLoader` created from a Hugging Face `Dataset` object yields dictionaries of tensors, but the training and evaluation functions were written to expect tuples of tensors.

I will correct the `train_student`, `evaluate_student`, and `find_hard_examples` functions in `gemini/models.py` to correctly unpack the dictionary batches. Then, I will rerun the experiment.Now that I've corrected the batch handling logic in `models.py`, I will rerun the experiment.The experiment failed again. This time, the error is `ValueError: The model has been loaded with \`accelerate\` and therefore cannot be moved to a specific device. Please discard the \`device\` argument when creating your pipeline object.`.

This error occurs because I'm loading the generator model with `device_map="auto"`, which uses the `accelerate` library to automatically distribute the model across available devices (like GPU and CPU). When a model is loaded this way, you cannot manually specify a `device` when creating a Hugging Face `pipeline`, as `accelerate` handles the device placement.

The fix is to remove the `device` argument from the `pipeline` creation call in `generation.py` for the generator model.

**Plan:**
1.  Modify `generation.py` to remove the `device` argument from the `pipeline` calls that use the `accelerate`-loaded generator model.
2.  Rerun the experiment.I see. The `replace` command failed because the string I was trying to replace appeared twice in the `generation.py` file (once in `generate_static_synthetic_data` and once in `generate_symbiotic_data`).

I will correct this by providing the `expected_replacements=2` argument to the `replace` tool. This will ensure both instances are correctly updated.Now that I've corrected the `pipeline` creation in `generation.py`, I will rerun the experiment.The experiment ran much further this time but failed at the very end with a `FileNotFoundError`.

The error is in `report.py`: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'gemini/results.md'`.

Looking at the call in `run_experiment.py`:
`generate_report(report_path, report_path, fig_paths)`

And the definition in `report.py`:
`def generate_report(results_path, report_path, fig_paths):`

I see the issue. I'm passing `report_path` for both the `results_path` (the input JSON file) and the `report_path` (the output Markdown file). The first argument to `generate_report` should be the path to the `results.json` file.

I will correct this simple argument mistake in `run_experiment.py` and rerun the script. Since all the computationally expensive training and generation steps have already completed and the `results.json` file was saved, this final run should be very quick.The argument error has been fixed. Now I will execute the script one last time. This should complete the final report generation and file organization steps successfully.The experiment has completed successfully. All steps, including data processing, model training for all four conditions, evaluation, result saving, figure generation, report creation, and file organization, have been executed.

The final results, including `results.md`, `log.txt`, and the generated figures, have been moved to the `results` directory as requested. The automated experimental plan is now fully implemented and executed.
