**Key Challenges:**

1. **Overemphasis on Single Metrics**: Current benchmarking practices often focus on singular performance metrics like accuracy, neglecting other critical dimensions such as fairness, robustness, and computational efficiency.

2. **Lack of Contextualized Evaluation**: Evaluations frequently occur without considering the specific context or application of the model, leading to assessments that may not reflect real-world performance or suitability.

3. **Data Contamination in Benchmarks**: The inclusion of benchmark data in training datasets can lead to inflated performance metrics, undermining the reliability of evaluations.

4. **Limited Standardization in Evaluation Practices**: The absence of standardized evaluation protocols results in inconsistencies across studies, making it challenging to compare models effectively.

5. **Insufficient Consideration of Ethical and Social Implications**: Evaluations often overlook the ethical and social impacts of deploying machine learning models, which is crucial for responsible AI development.
