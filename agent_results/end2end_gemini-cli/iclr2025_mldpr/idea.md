**Title:** Contextualized Evaluation as a Service (CEaaS) for Holistic Benchmarking

**Motivation:** Current machine learning benchmarking overemphasizes single performance metrics, like accuracy, ignoring other crucial dimensions such as fairness, robustness, and computational efficiency. This narrow focus encourages the development of models that may not be practical, safe, or responsible for real-world deployment, creating a disconnect between benchmark performance and deployment readiness.

**Main Idea:** We propose a "Contextualized Evaluation as a Service" (CEaaS) framework, integrated into repositories like Hugging Face. Instead of a static leaderboard, users would define an "evaluation context" by selecting or weighting desired attributes (e.g., high fairness for a loan model, low latency for an edge device). The CEaaS would then automatically execute a suite of evaluations on a target model, assessing its performance across these multiple axes. The output would be a multi-dimensional report, perhaps as a radar chart, visualizing the model's trade-offs within the specified context. This promotes a holistic understanding and facilitates the selection of models truly appropriate for their intended use-case.
