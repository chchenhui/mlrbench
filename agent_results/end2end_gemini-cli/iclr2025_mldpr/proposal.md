# **Contextualized Evaluation as a Service (CEaaS): A Framework for Holistic and User-Driven Benchmarking in Machine Learning Repositories**

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Background
The machine learning (ML) research and development lifecycle is critically dependent on datasets and the benchmarking practices built around them. Platforms like Hugging Face Datasets, OpenML, and the UCI ML Repository have become central pillars of the ecosystem, democratizing access to data and facilitating reproducible research. However, a growing consensus within the community, articulated in works by Hutchinson et al. (2022) and in the very motivation for this workshop, highlights a significant "evaluation gap." Current benchmarking paradigms are overwhelmingly dominated by a narrow focus on a single performance metric, such as accuracy or F1-score. This "leaderboard-driven" development encourages a culture of "SOTA-chasing" that, while effective at optimizing for a specific objective, often neglects other critical dimensions of model performance requisite for real-world deployment. Consequently, models that top leaderboards may be brittle, biased, computationally prohibitive, or otherwise misaligned with the requirements of a practical application.

The limitations of this single-metric paradigm are well-documented. Liang et al. (2022) introduced the Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) framework, a landmark effort to systematize evaluation across a wide range of metrics, including accuracy, robustness, fairness, bias, and efficiency. HELM provides a crucial taxonomy and a more transparent view of model trade-offs. However, its static, one-size-fits-all nature presents its own challenges. The relative importance of these different axes is not universal; it is fundamentally dependent on the model's intended use case—its *context*. For instance, a model for autonomous vehicle perception demands unparalleled robustness, whereas a model for summarizing news articles for a mobile app must prioritize low latency and low memory usage. The urgent need for evaluation methodologies that are not just holistic but also *contextualized* is a recurring theme in recent literature (Lengerich et al., 2023; Malaviya et al., 2024; Kaleidoscope, 2023).

This proposal introduces **Contextualized Evaluation as a Service (CEaaS)**, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between static, holistic benchmarks and the dynamic, context-specific needs of ML practitioners. Instead of a single, fixed leaderboard, we envision an interactive service integrated directly into data and model repositories. CEaaS empowers users—researchers, developers, and auditors—to define their own "evaluation context" by specifying and weighting a set of desired model attributes. The service then automates the execution of a comprehensive suite of evaluations tailored to this context, delivering a multi-dimensional, easily interpretable report. By making contextualized, holistic evaluation an accessible, on-demand service, we aim to catalyze a fundamental culture shift towards the development and deployment of more responsible, reliable, and fit-for-purpose machine learning models.

### 1.2. Research Objectives
The primary goal of this research is to design, implement, and validate the Contextualized Evaluation as a Service (CEaaS) framework. We delineate this goal into four specific objectives:

1.  **To develop a formal framework for defining "Evaluation Contexts."** This involves creating a structured yet flexible specification that allows users to articulate multi-faceted evaluation requirements, including performance targets, fairness constraints, robustness thresholds, and efficiency budgets.
2.  **To design a modular and extensible software architecture for CEaaS.** The architecture will be designed for seamless integration into modern data and model repositories (e.g., as a plugin for Hugging Face or OpenML), an orchestrator for managing evaluation workflows, and a set of containerized, independent "Evaluation Runners" for each evaluation axis.
3.  **To implement a functional open-source prototype of the CEaaS framework.** This prototype will include a user interface for context definition, the backend orchestration logic, and initial Evaluation Runners for a core set of metrics covering accuracy, fairness, robustness, and computational efficiency.
4.  **To validate the utility and effectiveness of CEaaS through rigorous case studies.** We will conduct experiments on well-understood models and tasks to demonstrate how CEaaS reveals crucial model trade-offs invisible to traditional leaderboards and facilitates more informed model selection for specific, real-world deployment scenarios.

### 1.3. Significance
This research is significant for its potential to directly address several critical issues in contemporary ML data and benchmarking practices identified by this workshop. By shifting the paradigm from static leaderboards to dynamic, user-driven evaluation, CEaaS offers transformative benefits. For **ML researchers**, it provides a powerful tool to understand the nuanced trade-offs of their models, moving beyond incremental gains on a single metric. For **ML engineers and practitioners**, it operationalizes the process of selecting a model that is truly "best for the job," aligning benchmark performance with deployment-readiness. For **data repositories**, it presents a tangible path to evolve from passive hosts of data and models into active facilitators of responsible AI development and governance. Ultimately, this work aims to foster a more mature evaluation culture within the ML community, one that values holistic understanding over simplistic rankings and promotes the creation of models that are not only performant but also safe, fair, and practical.

## 2. Methodology

Our research methodology is organized into three interconnected phases: (1) Formalization and System Design, (2) Prototyping and Implementation, and (3) Experimental Validation.

### 2.1. Phase 1: Formalizing the Evaluation Context and CEaaS Architecture

#### 2.1.1. Defining the Evaluation Context
The cornerstone of our framework is the formal definition of an "Evaluation Context," denoted by $C$. A context is a user-defined specification that guides the evaluation process. We formally define a context $C$ as a tuple:

$$ C = (\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{W}, \mathcal{T}) $$

where:
- $\mathcal{M} = \{m_1, m_2, \dots, m_k\}$ is a set of selected **evaluation axes**. Each axis $m_i$ corresponds to a measurable property of a model. Our initial implementation will support axes from four primary categories:
    - **Performance:** Standard metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, BLEU, ROUGE.
    - **Fairness:** Group fairness metrics such as Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds, and Equal Opportunity, requiring the user to specify sensitive attributes in the data.
    - **Robustness:** Performance under data perturbations, including adversarial attacks (e.g., PGD), concept drift, and common corruptions (e.g., noise, blur).
    - **Efficiency:** Resource consumption metrics like inference latency, throughput, model size (parameters), and memory footprint.
- $\mathcal{W} = \{w_1, w_2, \dots, w_k\}$ is a vector of non-negative **weights** corresponding to the axes in $\mathcal{M}$, where $\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i = 1$. This vector captures the user's explicit prioritization of different model attributes.
- $\mathcal{T} = \{\tau_1, \tau_2, \dots, \tau_k\}$ is a set of optional **constraints or thresholds** for each axis. For instance, a user could specify a constraint like $\tau_{\text{latency}} < 50\text{ms}$ or $\tau_{\text{DemographicParityDifference}} < 0.05$.

This formalization allows CEaaS to translate a user's qualitative needs (e.g., "I need a fast and reasonably fair model") into a quantitative and actionable evaluation plan.

#### 2.1.2. System Architecture
We propose a modular, service-oriented architecture to ensure scalability and extensibility. The CEaaS will consist of three main components:

1.  **Frontend Interface (API/UI):** A user-facing component integrated into a model repository's webpage (e.g., a "Contextualized Evaluation" tab on a Hugging Face model card). It allows users to graphically or programmatically define the context $C$.
2.  **Orchestration Engine:** The central nervous system of CEaaS. It receives the model identifier and the context $C$ from the frontend. Its responsibilities include:
    - Parsing $C$ to identify the required evaluation axes.
    - Provisioning and dispatching jobs to the appropriate Evaluation Runners.
    - Aggregating results.
    - Performing normalization and scoring.
    - Generating the final report.
3.  **Evaluation Runner Pool:** A collection of specialized, containerized microservices. Each runner is an expert at measuring a specific axis or category of axes (e.g., `FairnessRunner`, `RobustnessRunner`, `EfficiencyRunner`). This modular design allows new evaluation techniques (e.g., a new adversarial attack) to be added simply by deploying a new runner, without altering the core system. The runners will leverage established libraries like `evaluate` for performance, `fairlearn` for fairness, `art` or `textattack` for robustness, and platform-specific profiling tools for efficiency.

#### 2.1.3. Algorithmic Workflow
The end-to-end process for evaluating a model $M$ within a context $C$ is as follows:

1.  **Submission:** A user submits the tuple $(M, C, D)$ to the CEaaS, where $D$ is the identifier for the evaluation dataset.
2.  **Dispatch:** The Orchestration Engine parses $C$ and sends parallel requests to the relevant runners in the pool. For example, if $m_1$ is 'Accuracy' and $m_2$ is 'Demographic Parity', it calls the `PerformanceRunner` and `FairnessRunner`.
3.  **Execution:** Each runner fetches the model $M$ and dataset $D$, performs its specific evaluation, and returns a raw score $s_i$ for its axis $m_i$. To mitigate data contamination, runners can employ dynamic evaluation strategies, such as evaluating on newly released (post-training) data slices, as inspired by recent literature (Recent Advances..., 2025).
4.  **Normalization:** The Orchestration Engine collects the vector of raw scores $S = [s_1, s_2, \dots, s_k]$. As these scores are on different scales (e.g., accuracy in [0, 1], latency in ms), they must be normalized. We will implement empirical normalization, where each score $s_i$ is transformed into a normalized score $s'_i \in [0, 1]$ based on the distribution of scores from a wide range of models on the same task. The normalized score $s'_i$ for a value $v$ is given by $F_i(v)$, where $F_i$ is the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) for metric $i$. This means a score of 0.9 indicates the model performs better than 90% of baseline models on that axis.
5.  **Scoring and Ranking:** A holistic, context-aware score $S_C$ is calculated as the weighted sum of the normalized scores:
    $$ S_C(M, C) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \cdot s'_{i} $$
    This score can be used to rank models *within that specific context*. Concurrently, the system checks if the raw scores $s_i$ satisfy the user-defined thresholds $\tau_i \in \mathcal{T}$.
6.  **Reporting:** The final output is not just the score $S_C$, but a comprehensive report. The primary visualization will be a **radar chart**, with each spoke representing one of the evaluation axes $m_i$ and the length of the spoke corresponding to the normalized score $s'_i$. This provides an immediate, intuitive visualization of the model's strengths and weaknesses. The report will also include a detailed table with raw scores, normalized scores, and pass/fail status against the defined thresholds $\mathcal{T}$.

### 2.2. Phase 2: Prototype Implementation
We will implement a prototype of CEaaS using a modern technology stack. The backend Orchestration Engine will be developed in Python using a web framework like FastAPI. The Evaluation Runners will be implemented as Docker containers, allowing for easy deployment and isolation. For the frontend, we will develop a proof-of-concept web interface using a JavaScript framework (e.g., React or Vue.js) that can be embedded as a widget into a repository's HTML. We will target integration with the Hugging Face Hub, leveraging its extensive model and dataset collections and its `evaluate` library as a foundation for our `PerformanceRunner`.

### 2.3. Phase 3: Experimental Design and Validation
The validation of CEaaS will focus on demonstrating its utility over traditional evaluation methods. We will conduct two primary case studies.

#### 2.3.1. Case Study 1: Context-Driven Model Selection for a High-Stakes Financial Task
This case study will simulate the process of selecting a sentiment analysis model to classify text from loan applications.
-   **Models:** We will select 3-5 well-known transformer models with varying architectures and sizes (e.g., BERT-large, DistilBERT, RoBERTa-base, T5-small).
-   **Dataset:** We will use a public text classification dataset (e.g., Financial PhraseBank) and synthetically augment it with protected attributes (e.g., gendered names, geographic proxies for race) to enable fairness evaluation.
-   **Contexts:** We will define two distinct evaluation contexts:
    1.  **"Regulator Context" ($C_{reg}$):** High weights on fairness (Demographic Parity) and robustness (to typos and adversarial phrasing). Accuracy is important but secondary.
    2.  **"Fintech Startup Context" ($C_{su}$):** High weights on efficiency (low latency, small model size for cheap hosting). Accuracy is important, but fairness and robustness are given lower priority.
-   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that the model ranking produced by CEaaS will differ dramatically between $C_{reg}$ and $C_{su}$. The most accurate model (e.g., BERT-large) might be ranked highest on a traditional leaderboard but may score poorly in $C_{su}$ due to high latency. Conversely, a smaller model like DistilBERT might top the ranking for $C_{su}$ but be flagged for fairness violations in $C_{reg}$.
-   **Evaluation:** We will compare the model rankings generated by CEaaS under each context to a baseline ranking based solely on accuracy. We will use rank correlation coefficients (e.g., Kendall's $\tau$) to quantify the difference in rankings, expecting a low correlation. The generated radar charts will be used to qualitatively demonstrate the trade-offs.

#### 2.3.2. Case Study 2: Benchmarking Robustness to Data Heterogeneity
This case study will demonstrate CEaaS's ability to provide deeper insights into model generalization, a theme explored in benchmarking for federated learning (Li et al., 2025).
-   **Task:** Image classification (e.g., using CIFAR-10).
-   **Models:** Two CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet18, MobileNetV2).
-   **Context:** A context focused on robustness to data distribution shifts. The evaluation axes $\mathcal{M}$ will include:
    - $m_1$: Accuracy on the standard IID test set.
    - $m_2$: Accuracy on a corrupted version of the test set (e.g., CIFAR-10-C).
    - $m_3$: Accuracy on a subset of the test set representing a "hard" minority subgroup.
-   **Hypothesis:** CEaaS will reveal which model offers more stable performance across varying data conditions, an insight not available from a standard accuracy score. This validates the framework's utility for assessing model reliability, a key aspect of holistic Deep Learning (Bertsimas et al., 2024).

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

This research will produce several key deliverables and is poised to have a significant impact on the ML community.

### 3.1. Expected Outcomes
-   **A Formal Specification for Evaluation Contexts:** A well-defined, machine-readable schema for declaring evaluation requirements. This could serve as a foundation for a future community standard.
-   **An Open-Source CEaaS Prototype:** A publicly available codebase on a platform like GitHub, comprising the Orchestration Engine, a suite of initial Evaluation Runners, and a proof-of-concept UI. This will serve as a concrete implementation for others to use, critique, and extend.
-   **Comprehensive Validation Reports:** Detailed results from our case studies, including all generated reports, visualizations, and analyses, which will empirically demonstrate the value-add of contextualized evaluation.
-   **A High-Impact Publication:** A manuscript detailing the framework, architecture, and validation results will be submitted to a top-tier machine learning conference (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) and to "The Future of Machine Learning Data Practices and Repositories" workshop.

### 3.2. Impact
The broader impact of this work is its potential to fundamentally reshape evaluation practices in machine learning, directly addressing the core themes of this workshop.

-   **Catalyzing a Culture Shift:** By making holistic, contextualized evaluation accessible, CEaaS can help shift the community's focus from a monolithic pursuit of "SOTA" towards a more nuanced and application-aware understanding of model performance. This directly counters the **overemphasis on single metrics** and the **lack of contextualized evaluation** identified as key challenges.
-   **Enhancing Data and Model Repositories:** This project provides a practical blueprint for how repositories can evolve into dynamic evaluation platforms. By integrating CEaaS, platforms like Hugging Face can empower their users to perform more responsible and meaningful model vetting, a direct contribution to "Data repository design and challenges" and "Non-traditional/alternative benchmarking paradigms."
-   **Promoting Responsible AI:** By elevating fairness, robustness, and efficiency to first-class evaluation axes, CEaaS operationalizes the principles of responsible AI. It forces developers and users to confront the ethical and social implications of their models during the evaluation phase, rather than as an afterthought, addressing the challenge of **insufficient consideration of ethical and social implications**.
-   **Improving Standardization and Reproducibility:** The formal context definition and modular architecture provide a standardized protocol for evaluation. This could mitigate **limited standardization in evaluation practices** and improve the reproducibility of complex, multi-objective benchmarks. Furthermore, the design of dynamic Evaluation Runners can help address the persistent problem of **data contamination** in static benchmarks.

In conclusion, Contextualized Evaluation as a Service is not merely an alternative to leaderboards; it is a fundamental re-imagining of their purpose. It transforms evaluation from a static, passive ranking into a dynamic, interactive dialogue between the model, the data, and the specific needs of the end-user, thereby paving the way for a more mature, responsible, and impactful future for machine learning.
