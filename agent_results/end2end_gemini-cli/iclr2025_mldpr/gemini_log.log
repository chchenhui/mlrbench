Excellent. Based on my analysis of the provided documents, I have formulated a comprehensive experimental plan that directly implements Case Study 1 from the `proposal.md`. This plan will test the core hypothesis that the optimal machine learning model changes based on the evaluation context.

The experiment will involve fine-tuning three different transformer models (`bert-base-uncased`, `distilbert-base-uncased`, and `roberta-base`) on the `financial_phrasebank` dataset. I will then evaluate these models across four distinct axes: accuracy, fairness, robustness, and latency. Finally, I will calculate a context-aware score for each model under two different scenarios: a "Regulator Context" that prioritizes fairness and robustness, and a "Fintech Startup Context" that prioritizes efficiency and accuracy.

I will now begin the implementation. The first step is to create the `gemini` directory to house all the experimental code and results.Now that the `gemini` directory is created, I will write the Python script to run the experiment. This script will:

1.  **Load and prepare the data:** Download the `financial_phrasebank` dataset and preprocess it.
2.  **Define models:** Specify the three transformer models to be evaluated.
3.  **Implement evaluation metrics:**
    *   **Accuracy:** Standard classification accuracy.
    *   **Fairness:** A synthetic fairness evaluation based on whether the text contains a geographic keyword (e.g., 'london', 'tokyo', 'dakar'). This will simulate a scenario where we want to ensure the model performs equally well across different regions.
    *   **Robustness:** Evaluate the model's performance on text with typos introduced.
    *   **Latency:** Measure the inference time per sample.
4.  **Fine-tune and evaluate models:** Loop through each model, fine-tune it on the training data, and then run the full suite of evaluations.
5.  **Calculate contextual scores:** Apply the weights for the "Regulator" and "Fintech Startup" contexts to the normalized evaluation results.
6.  **Visualize results:** Generate and save plots for:
    *   The main comparison of models across all metrics (radar chart).
    *   The final contextual scores for each scenario.
7.  **Save results:** Store the raw and final scores in a JSON file.

This comprehensive script will be saved as `gemini/run_experiment.py`.I apologize for the error. I must use absolute paths. I will correct this and all subsequent file operations.

First, I need to get the absolute path of the current working directory.Okay, the current working directory is `/home/chenhui/mlr-bench/pipeline_gemini-cli/iclr2025_mldpr`. I will now use this to construct the absolute path for `gemini/run_experiment.py` and write the file again.Next, I will create the `README.md` file in the `gemini` directory to explain how to set up the environment and run the experiment.Now that the experiment script and README are in place, I will execute the experiment. I will run the `run_experiment.py` script. This will train the models, run the evaluations, generate the results and figures, and save the log file. I will use `nohup` to ensure the process runs to completion in the background and tee the output to the console and the log file.The experiment is now running in the background. I will monitor the process and wait for it to complete. I can check the `log.txt` file to see the progress. I'll wait for a reasonable amount of time for the experiment to finish before proceeding.

I will check the process list to see if the experiment is still running.The process is still running. I will wait a bit longer. I'll check the log file to see the progress.The log file shows that the script has started and TensorFlow is initializing. It seems to be running correctly. I will wait for the process to complete. I'll check the process status again.The process is still running. I will check the log file again to see the progress.The log file is not showing any new output. It's possible the script is downloading models or data, which can take time. I will wait a bit longer and check again.The process is still running. I will check the log file again.It appears the experiment failed because the `textattack` library is not installed. I will install it and re-run the experiment. I will also install `accelerate` as it is mentioned in the README.Now that the missing packages are installed, I will run the experiment again.The experiment is running again. I will monitor its progress.The process is still running. I will check the log file to see the progress.The log shows the same initialization messages as before. I'll wait for more output.The process is still running. I will check the log file again.The log file is still not showing progress beyond the initial startup messages. This is unexpected. I will check the `results` directory to see if any files have been created. This might indicate that the script is running but that the logging to the file is not working as expected.The `results` directory has not been created, which confirms the script is not progressing. The log file is not updating, which suggests the script might be hanging or has exited without flushing the logs.

I will try running the script directly in the foreground to see the real-time output and identify the issue. This will help me debug the problem more effectively. I will kill the previous background process first.Now that I've stopped the background process, I'll run the script in the foreground to observe its output directly.The script failed with an `ImportError`. It seems the `WordSwapRandomCharacter` class does not exist in the version of `textattack` I have installed. The error message suggests `WordSwapRandomCharacterDeletion`. I will modify the script to use `WordSwapRandomCharacter` from `textattack.transformations.word_swaps` and if that fails I will use the suggested `WordSwapRandomCharacterDeletion`. I will also add a check for the `textattack` version.

I will now read the `run_experiment.py` file to get the content to modify.I will now modify the `run_experiment.py` script to handle the `ImportError`. I will change the import statement and the `evaluate_robustness` function.Now that I've corrected the import, I will run the experiment again in the foreground to ensure it works correctly.It seems my first attempt to fix the import was incorrect. The module `textattack.transformations.word_swaps` does not contain `WordSwapRandomCharacter`. The error message is very helpful and suggests `WordSwapRandomCharacterDeletion`. I will use that instead.

I will now modify the `run_experiment.py` script again to use the correct class.I also need to change the `evaluate_robustness` function to use the new class.Now that I've corrected the import and the function call, I will run the experiment again in the foreground.The experiment is now failing because of a `wandb.errors.errors.UsageError`. The `transformers` library, by default, tries to connect to Weights & Biases (wandb) for logging, which requires an API key and interactive login. Since this is a non-interactive environment, it fails.

To fix this, I will disable wandb logging in the `TrainingArguments`. I will set the `report_to` argument to `"none"`.

I will now modify the `run_experiment.py` script to disable wandb.Now that I've disabled `wandb` logging, I will run the experiment again in the foreground to confirm it runs successfully.The script failed again. This time, the error is a `TypeError` in the `WordSwapRandomCharacterDeletion` class. It seems this class does not accept the `random_char_min` and `random_char_max` arguments.

I will modify the `evaluate_robustness` function to remove these arguments and use the default behavior of the `WordSwapRandomCharacterDeletion` class.Now that I've corrected the arguments for `WordSwapRandomCharacterDeletion`, I will run the experiment again in the foreground. This time, I expect it to complete successfully.It appears I am still misunderstanding the `textattack` library. The error now indicates that `transformations_per_example` is not a valid argument for `WordSwapRandomCharacterDeletion`. It seems I should not be passing any arguments to the constructor.

I will modify the `evaluate_robustness` function one last time to remove all arguments from the `WordSwapRandomCharacterDeletion` constructor.I am now confident that the script will run correctly. I will execute it one more time in the foreground.It seems I'm still having trouble with the `textattack` library. The error is now `AttributeError: 'WordSwapRandomCharacterDeletion' object has no attribute 'augment'`. It appears I'm using the class incorrectly. I need to find the correct method to use for augmentation.

After a quick search, I found that the correct way to use a `Transformation` in `textattack` is to call the `transform` method on a list of `AttackedText` objects. I will modify the `evaluate_robustness` function to use the correct API.Now I will replace the `evaluate_robustness` function.I am confident that the script is now correct. I will run it in the foreground one last time to ensure it completes without errors.It seems I'm still having issues with the `textattack` library. The error is now `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'textattack.attacked_text'`.

I will try to find the correct import for `AttackedText`. After a quick search, it seems that `AttackedText` is in `textattack.shared.attacked_text`. I will modify the import statement accordingly.I will now run the experiment again in the foreground. I am hopeful that this will be the final time.Excellent! The experiment has finally completed successfully. All models were trained and evaluated, and the results were saved.

Now I will create the `results.md` file to analyze and summarize the experiment results. This file will include the tables and figures generated by the experiment, along with a discussion of the findings.Finally, I will create the `results` directory and move the `results.md` file, `log.txt`, and the generated figures into it.I will now move the generated figures into the `results` directory.I see, the figures were already created inside the `results` directory by the script. My apologies for the redundant `mv` command. The `results` directory should now contain all the necessary files.

I have completed all the steps requested by the user.
I have:
1.  Created a `gemini` folder.
2.  Written a Python script to run the experiment automatically.
3.  Written a `README.md` file to explain how to run the experiment.
4.  Run the experiment automatically and generated the results and figures.
5.  Saved the experiment execution process in `log.txt`.
6.  Analyzed and summarized the experiment results in `results.md`.
7.  Created a `results` folder and moved all the results into it.

I am now finished with the task.
