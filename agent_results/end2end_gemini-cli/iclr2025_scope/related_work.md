**2. Key Challenges:**

1. **Routing Adaptability**: Developing routing mechanisms that can dynamically adapt to unseen tasks without retraining remains a significant challenge. Existing MoE models often rely on static or pre-defined routing functions, limiting their flexibility in zero-shot scenarios.

2. **Expert Specialization and Uniformity**: Ensuring that experts within an MoE model develop distinct specializations without redundancy is crucial. Many models face issues with expert uniformity, where experts do not diverge sufficiently, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance.

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: MoE architectures are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where malicious actors can exploit routing mechanisms to control model outputs. Addressing these security concerns is essential for the safe deployment of MoE models.

4. **Computational Efficiency**: Balancing the computational overhead associated with dynamic routing and expert activation is challenging. Efficiently managing resources while maintaining high performance is a key area of ongoing research.

5. **Generalization Across Domains**: Achieving robust performance across diverse and unseen domains without extensive fine-tuning is difficult. MoE models need to generalize effectively to new tasks, which requires innovative approaches to routing and expert training.

This literature review highlights recent advancements and ongoing challenges in the field of Mixture-of-Experts models, particularly concerning proactive routing and zero-shot task adaptation.
