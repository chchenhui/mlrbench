### **1. Title: Proactive Routing in Mixture-of-Experts for Zero-Shot Generalization to Unseen Tasks**

### **2. Introduction**

#### **2.1. Background and Motivation**
The advent of foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has revolutionized artificial intelligence. Their ability to perform a vast array of tasks with remarkable proficiency has spurred widespread adoption. However, their monolithic size poses significant computational challenges, especially for inference. The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture (Shazeer et al., 2017) has emerged as a leading paradigm for scaling these models efficiently. By dividing the model's knowledge into semi-independent "expert" subnetworks and activating only a small subset for each input token, MoE models can achieve the performance of much larger dense models at a fraction of the computational cost.

The core of an MoE model is its routing network, or "gating network," which learns to direct each input token to the most relevant experts. Typically, this router is trained alongside the experts on a large, static dataset, optimizing its policy for the pre-defined data distribution. While effective, this approach has a critical limitation: the routing policy is static. When the model is deployed and encounters new, unseen tasks or out-of-distribution data, the router's fixed policy may become suboptimal. It may fail to select the ideal combination of experts for the novel task, leading to a significant degradation in performance. This inflexibility hinders the model's ability to adapt dynamically, forcing practitioners into costly and slow cycles of full fine-tuning or router retraining for each new application domain.

This challenge is central to the goals of creating truly adaptive foundation models, as highlighted by the Workshop on Scalable Optimization for Efficient and Adaptive Foundation Models. The need for models that can perform "continual weight updates, compute- and memory-efficient fine-tuning, and personalized adaptation" points directly to the shortcomings of static MoE routing. Recent research has explored enhancing MoE routing through various means. For instance, Symbolic-MoE (Chen et al., 2025) routes based on instance-level skills, while others focus on improving routing stability (Nguyen et al., 2025) or integrating with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA (Kunwar et al., 2025). However, these approaches either require task-specific modifications or rely on token-level features, but do not provide a mechanism for proactively configuring the model for an unseen task in a zero-shot fashion.

#### **2.2. Research Objectives**
This research proposes a novel solution called the **Proactive Router**, a lightweight meta-learning framework designed to endow MoE models with the ability to perform zero-shot task adaptation. Instead of a static router, we introduce a meta-network that learns a mapping from a high-level task description (e.g., a natural language instruction) to an optimal routing policy. At inference time, when presented with a new task, this Proactive Router generates a task-specific configuration for the main MoE gating network on-the-fly, without requiring any gradient updates or fine-tuning. This allows the foundation model to dynamically specialize its expert activation patterns for the task at hand, enabling rapid, efficient, and effective adaptation.

The primary objectives of this research are:
1.  **To design and implement a Proactive Router (PRo-MoE)**, a meta-network that learns to generate task-specific parameters for an MoE model's gating network based on a task description.
2.  **To develop a scalable meta-learning framework** for training the Proactive Router alongside the expert networks on a large and diverse collection of instructional tasks.
3.  **To empirically validate the effectiveness of the Proactive Router** for zero-shot generalization. We will evaluate its performance on a suite of unseen downstream tasks, comparing it against strong baselines including standard MoE models and few-shot PEFT methods.
4.  **To analyze the learned routing behaviors and expert specialization.** We will investigate how the Proactive Router adapts its policy for different tasks and whether this leads to more meaningful and efficient expert utilization compared to static routers.

#### **2.3. Significance**
The successful implementation of this research will represent a significant step towards creating truly adaptive and scalable foundation models. The primary impact will be in enabling **compute-free task specialization at inference time**. This has profound implications:
*   **Enhanced Efficiency and Scalability:** A single, pre-trained MoE model could be deployed to serve a multitude of diverse and evolving tasks without the need to store and manage a separate set of fine-tuned weights for each one. This dramatically reduces memory footprint, model management overhead, and inference latency associated with model swapping.
*   **Rapid Personalization and Continual Adaptation:** The Proactive Router provides a mechanism for instantaneous personalization. A user's request, framed as a natural language instruction, could be used to configure the model in real-time. This is crucial for applications requiring adaptation to a continuous stream of new information or user preferences, such as news summarization or personalized assistants.
*   **A New Paradigm for Conditional Computation:** This work introduces a novel form of conditional computation where the model's execution path is conditioned not just on the input data, but on the high-level task itself. This meta-learning approach to routing could inspire new research directions in model adaptation, dynamic architectures, and efficient multi-task learning.

By directly addressing the core challenges of adaptive fine-tuning and task-specific model optimization, this research aligns perfectly with the central themes of the workshop and promises to deliver a practical and powerful technique for building the next generation of efficient and intelligent foundation models.

### **3. Methodology**

Our proposed methodology is structured into three phases: (1) Architectural Design of the Proactive Router MoE (PRo-MoE), (2) The Meta-Learning Training Framework, and (3) A comprehensive Experimental Design for validation.

#### **3.1. Architectural Design: The Proactive Router (PRo-MoE)**

We begin with a standard Transformer-based MoE architecture. In a vanilla MoE layer, the output for a given token representation $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a weighted combination of the outputs of $N$ expert networks $\{E_i\}_{i=1}^N$. The weights are produced by a gating network $G$.

$$
y = \sum_{i=1}^N G(x)_i \cdot E_i(x)
$$

The gating network $G(x)$ is typically a linear layer followed by a softmax function, which computes a probability distribution over the experts:

$$
G(x) = \text{Softmax}(x \cdot W_g)
$$

where $W_g \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times N}$ is the trainable weight matrix of the gating network. The core limitation is that $W_g$ is static.

Our **Proactive Router** modifies this by making the gating function task-dependent. We introduce two new components:

1.  **Task Encoder ($f_{enc}$):** A lightweight network, such as a frozen, pre-trained sentence transformer (e.g., MiniLM) or a small, trainable Transformer encoder, that maps a natural language task description $T_{desc}$ (e.g., "Translate this sentence from English to French") into a fixed-size task embedding $z_T \in \mathbb{R}^{d_t}$.
    $$
    z_T = f_{enc}(T_{desc})
    $$

2.  **Hypernetwork ($f_{hyper}$):** A small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that takes the task embedding $z_T$ as input and generates a task-specific modulation parameter, $\Delta_T$, for the gating network. We propose to modulate the gating logits via an adaptive bias term. This is less disruptive and more stable than generating the entire $W_g$ matrix.
    $$
    \Delta_T = f_{hyper}(z_T) \in \mathbb{R}^N
    $$

The new, **proactively configured gating function** $G(x, T_{desc})$ is then defined as:

$$
G(x, T_{desc}) = \text{Softmax}(x \cdot W_g + \Delta_T)
$$

Here, $W_g$ remains a general-purpose routing matrix learned across all tasks, while $\Delta_T$ provides a task-specific "nudge," re-ranking the experts to favor those most suitable for the task described by $T_{desc}$. This entire process is differentiable with respect to the parameters of $f_{hyper}$ and $f_{enc}$. The base expert networks $E_i$ and the general router weights $W_g$ are trained jointly with the Proactive Router components.

#### **3.2. Meta-Learning Framework**

Training PRo-MoE requires exposure to a wide variety of tasks to enable generalization to new ones. We adopt a meta-learning approach where each training batch is sampled from a specific task.

Let $\mathcal{D} = \{(T_j, D_j)\}_{j=1}^M$ be our meta-training dataset, where $T_j$ is the description for task $j$ and $D_j = \{(x_k, y_k)\}$ is the corresponding dataset for that task. The training procedure is as follows:

**For each training step:**
1.  **Sample a task:** Randomly select a task $T_j$ from $\mathcal{D}$.
2.  **Generate Task Embedding:** Compute the task embedding $z_{T_j} = f_{enc}(T_{desc, j})$.
3.  **Generate Routing Parameters:** Generate the adaptive bias $\Delta_{T_j} = f_{hyper}(z_{T_j})$.
4.  **Sample a data batch:** Draw a mini-batch of instances $\{(x_k, y_k)\}_{k=1}^B$ from the task's dataset $D_j$.
5.  **Forward Pass:** Process the batch through the PRo-MoE model. The gating networks in all MoE layers will use the same task-specific bias $\Delta_{T_j}$ to compute routing decisions. The model predicts outputs $\hat{y}_k$.
6.  **Calculate Loss:** The total loss $\mathcal{L}_{total}$ consists of the primary task loss $\mathcal{L}_{task}$ (e.g., cross-entropy) and an auxiliary load balancing loss $\mathcal{L}_{balance}$ common in MoE training.
    $$
    \mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{task}(\hat{y}, y) + \alpha \cdot \mathcal{L}_{balance}
    $$
    The load balancing loss encourages all experts to receive a roughly equal number of tokens across a batch, preventing a state where only a few experts are ever used. It is defined as:
    $$
    \mathcal{L}_{balance} = N \cdot \sum_{i=1}^N f_i \cdot P_i
    $$
    where $f_i$ is the fraction of tokens in the batch dispatched to expert $i$, and $P_i$ is the average routing probability for expert $i$ over the batch. $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter balancing the two loss terms.
7.  **Backward Pass & Parameter Update:** Compute gradients for all trainable parameters ($\theta_{enc}$, $\theta_{hyper}$, $W_g$, and all expert parameters $\{E_i\}$) and update them using an optimizer like AdamW.

This process forces the hypernetwork to learn a meaningful mapping from task descriptions to routing policies that minimize task loss, while the expert networks learn specialized functions that can be effectively combined to solve the diverse set of training tasks.

#### **3.3. Experimental Design**

Our experiments are designed to rigorously test the zero-shot task adaptation capabilities of PRo-MoE.

**Datasets:**
*   **Meta-Training:** We will use a large-scale, diverse, multi-task instruction dataset. The **Public Pool of Prompts (P3)** (Sanh et al., 2021) or **Super-NaturalInstructions** (Wang et al., 2022) are ideal candidates. They contain hundreds of tasks from various domains (e.g., classification, summarization, QA, generation) formatted with natural language instructions, which serve as our $T_{desc}$.
*   **Evaluation:** We will create a held-out set of tasks from P3/Super-NaturalInstructions that are unseen during meta-training. To test for broader generalization, we will also evaluate on standard benchmark suites like **BIG-Bench Hard** (Suzgun et al., 2022) and selected tasks from the **MMLU** benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021).

**Baselines:**
To demonstrate the superiority of our approach, we will compare PRo-MoE against several strong baselines:
1.  **Standard MoE:** An identical MoE model where the gating network is trained on the same mixture of meta-training data but without any task-specific information. This baseline establishes the performance of a static, general-purpose router.
2.  **Dense Model:** A dense transformer with a similar parameter count to the activated parameters of our MoE model, trained on the same data. This will provide a reference for the efficiency gains of the MoE architecture.
3.  **Multi-Task Fine-tuned MoE (MT-MoE):** The same standard MoE model from (1), but its performance is measured on tasks it was explicitly trained on. This shows the upper bound of a static router.
4.  **Few-Shot PEFT (LoRA):** For each unseen evaluation task, we will take the pre-trained standard MoE model and perform few-shot (e.g., 5-shot) fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the gating and/or self-attention layers. This is a powerful, state-of-the-art adaptation technique and serves as a critical point of comparison for our *zero-shot* method.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
Our evaluation will be multi-faceted, assessing not only task performance but also the model's internal dynamics.
*   **Task Performance:** We will use standard metrics for each evaluation task, such as Accuracy for classification, ROUGE-L for summarization, BLEU score for translation, and an overall score for benchmarks like MMLU.
*   **MoE-Specific Metrics:**
    *   **Expert Utilization:** We will measure the distribution of tokens routed to each expert for different tasks. We hypothesize that PRo-MoE will show sharper, more task-specific utilization patterns.
    *   **Routing Specialization Score:** We will define a metric, such as the Jensen-Shannon Divergence, to measure how much the routing distribution for a specific task deviates from the average routing distribution across all tasks. A higher score would indicate more pronounced task specialization.
    *   **Load Balancing:** We will report the load balancing loss at inference time to ensure that the proactive router does not lead to expert starvation.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** We will measure and compare the adaptation cost. PRo-MoE's adaptation cost is a single forward pass through the tiny meta-router, while the LoRA baseline requires gradient-based fine-tuning. We will report adaptation time and resource usage.

### **4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**Expected Outcomes:**
1.  **Superior Zero-Shot Performance:** We expect PRo-MoE to significantly outperform the standard MoE baseline on unseen tasks. The task-specific routing configuration should enable the model to combine expert knowledge more effectively, leading to higher accuracy and better generation quality.
2.  **Competitive with Few-Shot Methods:** We anticipate that PRo-MoE's zero-shot performance will be competitive with, and in some cases may even surpass, the performance of the few-shot LoRA baseline. This would be a landmark result, demonstrating that meta-learning a routing policy can be as effective as brief, gradient-based fine-tuning, but with orders of magnitude less computational cost for adaptation.
3.  **Qualitative Evidence of Dynamic Specialization:** Analysis of expert utilization patterns is expected to reveal clear, interpretable specialization. For example, we might observe that "translation" tasks consistently activate one set of experts, while "code generation" tasks activate another. This would provide strong evidence that the Proactive Router is learning a meaningful, high-level task-to-expert mapping.
4.  **Public Release of Code and Models:** Upon completion, we plan to release our implementation of PRo-MoE and the pre-trained models to the research community to facilitate further research into adaptive and dynamic model architectures.

**Impact:**
The outcomes of this research stand to make a substantial impact on both the theory and practice of machine learning.

*   **Scientific Impact:** This project will pioneer a new direction in conditional computation and model adaptation. By demonstrating that a model’s internal routing can be controlled by high-level instructions, we open the door for more sophisticated forms of meta-learning. This could influence future architectures beyond MoE, such as dynamic networks where entire computational graphs are configured on-the-fly based on task requirements. It directly contributes to the research on "Adaptive Routing with Mixture of Experts" and "Task Specific Adaptive Foundation Models" as solicited by the workshop.

*   **Practical and Industrial Impact:** The practical implications are immediate and significant. The ability to adapt a massive foundation model to a new task with a single forward pass transforms the economics of deploying AI services. It enables:
    *   **Highly Efficient Multi-Tenant Inference:** A single model instance can serve requests for thousands of different tasks simultaneously, simply by generating a new routing policy for each incoming request's task type. This eliminates the need for separate models, drastically reducing infrastructure costs and complexity.
    *   **On-the-Fly Personalization:** Service providers can offer deeply personalized user experiences by treating user profiles or queries as task descriptions, tailoring the model's behavior in real time without any user-specific fine-tuning.
    *   **Democratization of Model Adaptation:** PRo-MoE democratizes the ability to specialize foundation models. Users without the hardware or expertise for fine-tuning can still adapt powerful models to their specific needs simply by writing a clear instruction.

In conclusion, this research on Proactive Routing promises to deliver a scalable, efficient, and powerful mechanism for zero-shot task adaptation in MoE models. It directly addresses a critical bottleneck in the deployment of foundation models and represents a tangible step towards a future of more dynamic, intelligent, and adaptive AI systems.
