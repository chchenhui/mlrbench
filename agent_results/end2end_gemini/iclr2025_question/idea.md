**Title:** Adaptive Uncertainty-Gated Retrieval for Hallucination Mitigation

**Motivation:** Foundation models often hallucinate when internal knowledge is lacking or contradicts the prompt context. Current mitigation methods can be overly conservative, stifling creativity, or fail to adapt to nuanced situations. We need a dynamic approach to ground responses in reliable external knowledge only when necessary.

**Main Idea:**
We propose an uncertainty-gated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system.
1.  **Uncertainty Estimation:** During generation, for each potential next token or segment, the model estimates its internal uncertainty (e.g., using Monte Carlo dropout variance, entropy of predictive distribution, or a separately trained uncertainty predictor).
2.  **Adaptive Retrieval Trigger:** If the estimated uncertainty exceeds a dynamically adjusted threshold (potentially learned or context-dependent), a retrieval module is triggered to fetch relevant external knowledge.
3.  **Integration & Generation:** The retrieved information is then integrated into the model's context, guiding it towards a more factual and less hallucinatory continuation, while preserving creative generation flow when uncertainty is low.
Expected outcome: A system that significantly reduces hallucinations by opportunistically grounding outputs in factual data when the model is uncertain, thereby improving reliability without systematically dampening creativity in confident, factual generations.
