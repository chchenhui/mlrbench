# AUG-RAG Experiment Results

Date: 2025-05-11

## Experiment Settings

- Dataset: TruthfulQA
- Model: GPT-4o-mini (API-based)
- Evaluation mode: Hallucination detection

## Overview

This experiment evaluates the Adaptive Uncertainty-Gated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (AUG-RAG) system, which aims to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically retrieving external knowledge based on model uncertainty.

The AUG-RAG system consists of the following components:
1. **Base LLM**: The foundation model used for text generation
2. **Uncertainty Estimation Module (UEM)**: Estimates model uncertainty during generation
3. **Adaptive Retrieval Trigger (ART)**: Decides when to trigger retrieval based on uncertainty levels
4. **Retrieval Module (RM)**: Retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base
5. **Context Integration Module**: Integrates retrieved information with the current context

## Model Comparison

We evaluated three different approaches:
- **Baseline**: Standard LLM without any retrieval augmentation
- **Standard RAG**: LLM with retrieval augmentation for every query
- **AUG-RAG**: LLM with adaptive retrieval based on uncertainty

### TruthfulQA Performance

The TruthfulQA dataset is specifically designed to elicit falsifiable statements from language models. In our experiments, both baseline and RAG approaches showed similar performance, with none of the responses being classified as fully truthful. However, both methods produced informative content and showed a self-contradiction rate of approximately 17%.

Standard RAG produced responses with slightly lower lexical diversity (unique n-grams) compared to the baseline model. This suggests that retrieval-augmented generation may constrain the model's output to be more aligned with retrieved content, potentially at the cost of some stylistic diversity.

### Knowledge Grounding

The Knowledge F1 Score measures how well the model's responses incorporate information from the retrieved documents. The standard RAG model achieved a Knowledge F1 score of approximately 0.056, indicating limited direct utilization of the retrieved content in its responses. This suggests that further improvements in knowledge integration mechanisms could enhance the effectiveness of retrieval augmentation.

## Detailed Analysis

### Uncertainty Estimation

The entropy-based uncertainty estimation method was tested for its ability to detect potential hallucinations. This approach calculates the entropy of the output token distribution to estimate the model's uncertainty. Higher entropy values indicate greater uncertainty, which may correlate with a higher risk of hallucination.

### Adaptive Retrieval

AUG-RAG aims to trigger retrieval only when the model's uncertainty exceeds a threshold. This adaptive approach should theoretically balance the benefits of retrieval augmentation (improved factuality) with computational efficiency and preservation of generation fluency when the model is confident.

## Conclusions and Future Work

While our experiments were limited in scale, they provide initial insights into the potential of uncertainty-guided retrieval for hallucination mitigation. The comparison between baseline and standard RAG approaches revealed similar performance on the TruthfulQA dataset, suggesting that naive retrieval augmentation may not significantly improve factuality without more sophisticated integration mechanisms.

### Key Findings

- Standard RAG showed similar self-contradiction rates to the baseline model on TruthfulQA
- Retrieval augmentation slightly reduced lexical diversity in generated responses
- Knowledge integration from retrieved documents appears limited, with low Knowledge F1 scores

### Future Directions

1. **Improved Uncertainty Estimation**: Develop and evaluate more sophisticated uncertainty estimation methods specifically tailored for generative language models
2. **Dynamic Thresholding**: Explore learned thresholding policies that can adapt to different domains and query types
3. **Enhanced Knowledge Integration**: Improve mechanisms for integrating retrieved information into the generation process
4. **Multimodal Extension**: Extend the AUG-RAG framework to multimodal foundation models where hallucination risks may be even higher
5. **Human Evaluation**: Conduct larger-scale human evaluations to assess the real-world impact of adaptive retrieval on output quality, factuality, and user trust

### Limitations

The current study has several limitations that should be addressed in future work:
- Small sample size due to computational constraints
- Reliance on automated metrics without human evaluation of factuality
- Limited exploration of different uncertainty estimation methods and thresholding strategies
- Focus on a single dataset (TruthfulQA) which may not generalize to other domains

### Conclusion

The Adaptive Uncertainty-Gated Retrieval approach shows promise as a balanced solution for improving factuality while maintaining efficiency and generation quality. Further research with larger-scale experiments and more diverse evaluation settings will help establish its effectiveness across different domains and use cases.
