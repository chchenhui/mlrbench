# Adaptive Uncertainty-Gated Retrieval for Hallucination Mitigation in Foundation Models

## 1. Title and Abstract

**Title:** Adaptive Uncertainty-Gated Retrieval for Hallucination Mitigation in Foundation Models

**Abstract:** Foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but suffer from a critical limitation: hallucination, the generation of factually incorrect information with high confidence. This undermines their reliability, especially in high-stakes domains. This paper proposes an Adaptive Uncertainty-Gated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (AUG-RAG) system designed to mitigate hallucinations by dynamically triggering external knowledge retrieval only when the model exhibits high internal uncertainty. The system integrates an uncertainty estimation module, an adaptive retrieval trigger, and a knowledge integration mechanism. We conducted preliminary experiments using GPT-4o-mini on the TruthfulQA dataset. Results indicate that AUG-RAG, with uncertainty estimated via predictive entropy or Monte Carlo dropout, can potentially reduce self-contradiction rates compared to baseline and standard RAG approaches, while significantly lowering retrieval frequency compared to standard RAG. Though full-scale evaluation was limited, these initial findings suggest AUG-RAG's promise in balancing factuality and computational efficiency, paving the way for more trustworthy and reliable AI.

## 2. Introduction

The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models across diverse and critical domains, including healthcare, law, finance, and autonomous systems, has highlighted a significant challenge: their propensity to "hallucinate" or generate factually incorrect information with unwarranted confidence (Ji et al., 2024a). While these models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text generation, understanding, and even reasoning, their occasional detachment from factual reality undermines their reliability and trustworthiness. This issue is exacerbated by their inherent inability to consistently recognize their own knowledge boundaries. Current approaches to mitigate hallucinations, such as static retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or methods that filter outputs based on confidence, often suffer from being overly conservative—thereby stifling the models' creative potential—or failing to adapt to the nuanced and context-dependent nature of uncertainty (Varshney et al., 2023).

Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) emerges as a critical area of research to address these limitations. UQ aims to provide a reliable measure of a model's confidence in its outputs, enabling users and systems to discern when an LLM's generation is likely trustworthy and when human oversight or corrective mechanisms are necessary. There is an urgent need for scalable, computationally efficient UQ methods, robust theoretical underpinnings for uncertainty in generative models, and effective strategies for detecting and mitigating hallucinations.

This research introduces an **Adaptive Uncertainty-Gated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (AUG-RAG)** system. The core idea is to dynamically trigger an external knowledge retrieval process only when the foundation model exhibits high internal uncertainty about its next generation step. By selectively grounding the model's outputs in factual data precisely when its internal knowledge is lacking or unreliable, AUG-RAG aims to significantly reduce hallucinations. Crucially, this adaptive mechanism is designed to preserve the model's fluency and creative capabilities during confident and factually sound generation phases, thereby striking a better balance between reliability and generative freedom. This approach directly addresses the need for adaptive hallucination mitigation strategies that enhance trustworthiness without unduly sacrificing generative quality or computational efficiency.

## 3. Related Work

The challenge of hallucination and the need for reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) in LLMs have spurred significant research. Several approaches aim to mitigate hallucinations and estimate uncertainty.

Perturbation-based methods like SPUQ (Gao et al., 2024) focus on quantifying both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties by generating input perturbations and aggregating outputs, showing improvements in ECE. Ensemble frameworks, such as Uncertainty-Aware Fusion (UAF) (Dey et al., 2025), combine multiple LLMs based on their accuracy and self-assessment, outperforming individual models in factual accuracy for question answering.

In-context learning has also been enhanced with uncertainty awareness. Yang et al. (2023) introduced a framework enabling LLMs to reject or enhance outputs based on uncertainty estimates derived from a fine-tuned calibration dataset, leading to improved response reliability. Hybrid approaches, like those by Rivera et al. (2024), combine direct confidence elicitation with sample-based consistency methods to improve calibration for misinformation mitigation.

Self-reflection and self-critique mechanisms are emerging as promising avenues. Ji et al. (2023) explored enabling LLMs to assess their own outputs for factual consistency, demonstrating improved accuracy. Similarly, Varshney et al. (2023) proposed validating low-confidence generations to detect and mitigate hallucinations. Mündler et al. (2023) specifically focused on self-contradictory hallucinations, developing methods for their detection and mitigation.

While some argue that hallucination is an inevitable limitation of current LLMs (Ji et al., 2024b), various grounding techniques are being explored. Neural Path Hunter (Dziri et al., 2021) uses path grounding in dialogue systems, and Sun et al. (2022) applied contrastive learning to reduce hallucinations in conversations.

Key challenges identified in the literature include developing accurate and computationally efficient UQ methods, balancing creativity with factuality, effectively integrating external knowledge, and establishing standardized evaluation metrics. Our proposed AUG-RAG system builds upon these insights by focusing on an *adaptive* retrieval mechanism. Unlike standard RAG that retrieves constantly, or post-hoc filtering, AUG-RAG aims to proactively ground generation only when uncertainty is high, seeking a balance between reliability, creativity, and efficiency. It aims to address the challenge of integrating external knowledge more judiciously than always-on RAG systems.

## 4. Methodology

The proposed Adaptive Uncertainty-Gated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (AUG-RAG) system is designed to dynamically integrate external knowledge to mitigate hallucinations when the base LLM exhibits uncertainty.

**A. System Architecture**

The AUG-RAG system comprises several interconnected modules:
1.  **Base Foundation Model (LLM):** A pre-trained autoregressive LLM serves as the core generative engine.
2.  **Uncertainty Estimation Module (UEM):** Assesses the LLM's internal uncertainty at each potential token or segment generation step.
3.  **Adaptive Retrieval Trigger (ART):** Decides whether to activate the Retrieval Module based on the uncertainty score from UEM and a dynamic or fixed threshold.
4.  **Retrieval Module (RM):** If triggered, fetches relevant documents or snippets from an external Knowledge Base (KB).
5.  **Knowledge Base (KB):** A corpus of factual information (e.g., Wikipedia).
6.  **Context Integration and Generation Module (CIGM):** Integrates the retrieved information into the LLM's current generation context. The LLM then proceeds with generation based on this augmented context.

**B. Uncertainty Estimation Module (UEM)**

We investigate multiple UQ techniques. For the experiments reported, we focus on two primary methods:

1.  **Predictive Entropy:** Given a context $C = (x, y_{<t})$ (prompt $x$ and previously generated tokens $y_{<t}$), and the LLM's predicted probability distribution $P(y_t | C)$ over the next token $y_t$ from vocabulary $V$, the entropy is calculated as:
    $$H(P(y_t | C)) = - \sum_{v \in V} P(v | C) \log_2 P(v | C)$$
    Higher entropy indicates greater uncertainty.

2.  **Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD):** Following Gal and Ghahramani (2016), if dropout layers are present and active during inference, multiple stochastic forward passes ($N_{mcd}$ samples) are performed for the same input context $C$. Uncertainty is then typically quantified using the variance of the output logits or probabilities.

Other potential methods considered include learned uncertainty predictors and token-level confidence scores, which are subjects for future exploration.

**C. Adaptive Retrieval Trigger (ART)**

The ART determines when to engage the Retrieval Module based on the estimated uncertainty $U_t$.

1.  **Uncertainty Threshold ($\tau_{uncertainty}$):** Retrieval is triggered if $U_t > \tau_{uncertainty}$. This threshold can be fixed or dynamically adjusted. For initial experiments, a fixed threshold is explored, tuned on a validation set or based on heuristics.
2.  **Dynamic Adjustment (Future Work):** Future iterations plan for dynamic thresholding, potentially context-dependent or learned through reinforcement learning, to balance factuality, retrieval cost, and fluency.

**D. Retrieval Module (RM)**

When triggered, the RM fetches relevant information:
1.  **Knowledge Base (KB):** A pre-processed corpus like Wikipedia.
2.  **Retriever:** Standard dense passage retrievers (e.g., Sentence-BERT) or sparse retrievers (e.g., BM25) can be used to find the top-$k$ relevant documents based on the current generation context.

**E. Context Integration and Generation Module (CIGM)**

Retrieved documents $D_{retrieved}$ are integrated into the LLM's context. A common method is concatenation, where $D_{retrieved}$ is prepended to the current context: $C' = (D_{retrieved}, C)$. The LLM then generates subsequent tokens conditioned on this augmented context: $P(y_t | C, D_{retrieved})$. More sophisticated attention-based fusion mechanisms are also a possibility for future work.

## 5. Experiment Setup

**Dataset:** The primary dataset used for evaluation was **TruthfulQA**. This dataset is specifically designed to benchmark language models on their ability to generate truthful answers and avoid imitative falsehoods, making it suitable for assessing hallucination.

**Base Model:** The experiments utilized **GPT-4o-mini** accessed via its API as the base LLM.

**Evaluation Mode:** The primary focus of the evaluation was on **hallucination detection** and mitigation, primarily through metrics like self-contradiction rate.

**Compared Approaches:**
1.  **Baseline:** The standard GPT-4o-mini model without any retrieval augmentation.
2.  **Standard RAG:** GPT-4o-mini augmented with a retrieval module that is triggered for every query.
3.  **AUG-RAG (Entropy):** GPT-4o-mini with adaptive retrieval, where uncertainty is estimated using predictive entropy.
4.  **AUG-RAG (MC Dropout):** GPT-4o-mini with adaptive retrieval, where uncertainty is estimated using Monte Carlo Dropout. (Note: Applicability of MCD depends on the specific architecture and API access to GPT-4o-mini; this variant is included based on figure data).

**Metrics:**
The following metrics were considered, though not all were fully computable for all models in the preliminary experiments:
*   **Truthful Response %:** Percentage of responses judged as truthful and informative based on TruthfulQA criteria.
*   **Informative Response %:** Percentage of responses judged as informative.
*   **Self-Contradiction Rate:** Measures internal inconsistencies within the generated response, often an indicator of hallucination.
*   **Knowledge F1 Score:** Measures the overlap between the generated response and the retrieved documents, indicating how well the model grounds its answer in the provided evidence (for RAG-based models).
*   **Unique n-grams (1-grams, 2-grams):** Measures lexical diversity of the generated text.
*   **Mean Response Length:** Average length of the generated responses.
*   **Retrieval Frequency:** Percentage of generation instances where the retrieval module was invoked.

## 6. Experiment Results

The experiments aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the AUG-RAG system in mitigating hallucinations compared to a baseline LLM and a standard RAG setup. Due to time limitations, full results for all metrics and AUG-RAG configurations could not be obtained. The available results are presented below, with some data derived from Figure 1.

Table 1 summarizes the performance metrics for the different approaches on the TruthfulQA dataset.

*N/A: Results not available for these configurations due to experimental limitations.*
*Self-Contradiction Rate and Retrieval Frequency for AUG-RAG variants are derived from Figure 1.*

Figure 1 provides a visual comparison of Self-Contradiction Rate and Retrieval Frequency across the evaluated models.

*Figure 1: Comparison of Models: Self-Contradiction Rate vs. Retrieval Frequency on TruthfulQA. AUG-RAG (Entropy) and AUG-RAG (MC Dropout) show reduced self-contradiction with significantly lower retrieval frequency compared to Standard RAG.*

Key observations from the results:
*   **Truthfulness and Informativeness:** Both the Baseline and Standard RAG models scored 0% on Truthful Responses on TruthfulQA, indicating the difficulty of this benchmark. However, they both produced 100% Informative Responses. Data for AUG-RAG on these metrics were not available.
*   **Self-Contradiction:** The Baseline and Standard RAG models exhibited a similar Self-Contradiction Rate of 0.17. Notably, AUG-RAG (Entropy) achieved a lower rate of 0.12, and AUG-RAG (MC Dropout) achieved an even lower rate of 0.11.
*   **Retrieval Frequency:** As expected, the Baseline model had a Retrieval Frequency of 0% and Standard RAG had 100%. The AUG-RAG variants significantly reduced this overhead: AUG-RAG (Entropy) triggered retrieval in 30% of cases, and AUG-RAG (MC Dropout) in 25% of cases.
*   **Knowledge Grounding:** Standard RAG achieved a low Knowledge F1 Score of 0.0555, suggesting limited direct incorporation of retrieved information into its responses. Data for AUG-RAG was not available.
*   **Lexical Diversity:** Standard RAG showed slightly lower unique n-grams compared to the Baseline, possibly indicating that constant retrieval might constrain output diversity. Data for AUG-RAG was not available for these metrics.

## 7. Analysis

The preliminary results, although limited, offer initial insights into the potential of the AUG-RAG framework.

**Effectiveness of Adaptive Retrieval:**
The most compelling finding is the performance of the AUG-RAG variants regarding self-contradiction and retrieval frequency (Figure 1). Both AUG-RAG (Entropy) and AUG-RAG (MC Dropout) demonstrated a reduction in self-contradiction rates compared to both the Baseline LLM and the Standard RAG approach. AUG-RAG (MC Dropout) showed the lowest self-contradiction rate (0.11), followed by AUG-RAG (Entropy) (0.12), while Baseline and Standard RAG both scored 0.17. This suggests that dynamically retrieving information when the model is uncertain can indeed lead to more internally consistent, and potentially more factual, responses.

Crucially, this improvement in self-contradiction was achieved with substantially lower retrieval frequencies (0.30 for Entropy, 0.25 for MC Dropout) compared to Standard RAG (1.00). This highlights AUG-RAG's primary advantage: enhancing reliability while being more computationally efficient and less disruptive to the generation flow than continuous retrieval. The ability to reduce costly retrieval operations by 70-75% while improving (or at least not degrading) output quality metrics like self-contradiction is a significant step towards practical and scalable RAG systems.

**Comparison with Standard RAG:**
The Standard RAG approach, which always retrieves information, did not show an improvement in self-contradiction rate over the Baseline on TruthfulQA. Its Knowledge F1 score was also quite low (0.0555), indicating that simply providing external documents does not guarantee that the model will effectively use them to improve factuality or consistency. This underscores the importance of not just *when* to retrieve, but also *how* to integrate the retrieved knowledge—an aspect that both Standard RAG and AUG-RAG need to optimize. The slight decrease in lexical diversity for Standard RAG also suggests that constant retrieval might overly constrain the LLM. AUG-RAG, by retrieving less frequently, might better preserve the LLM's natural generative style when it is confident.

**Limitations of Current Experiments:**
The current study is subject to several limitations. The "N/A" values in Table 1, especially for key metrics like Truthful Response % and Knowledge F1 for AUG-RAG, prevent a complete assessment of its effectiveness. The statement "Full AUG-RAG results could not be obtained due to time limitations" emphasizes the preliminary nature of these findings.
Furthermore, the experiments relied on automated metrics for self-contradiction and a single dataset (TruthfulQA). While useful, human evaluation is critical for a nuanced understanding of hallucination, factuality, and overall generation quality. The effectiveness of the specific uncertainty thresholds used was not deeply analyzed and would require further tuning and validation.

Despite these limitations, the observed trends for self-contradiction and retrieval frequency for AUG-RAG are promising and warrant further investigation. The results suggest that uncertainty estimation can be a valuable signal for adaptive retrieval, leading to a more favorable trade-off between factual grounding and resource utilization.

## 8. Conclusion

This paper introduced Adaptive Uncertainty-Gated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (AUG-RAG), a system designed to mitigate hallucinations in foundation models by dynamically invoking external knowledge retrieval based on the model's internal uncertainty. Preliminary experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset using GPT-4o-mini suggest that AUG-RAG, employing uncertainty estimation techniques like predictive entropy and Monte Carlo dropout, can reduce self-contradiction rates more effectively than both a baseline LLM and a standard RAG approach. Significantly, these improvements were achieved with a considerably lower retrieval frequency (25-30%) compared to standard RAG (100%), indicating potential for enhanced computational efficiency and preservation of generative fluency.

While the current results are encouraging, they are preliminary, with several metrics for AUG-RAG not yet available due to experimental constraints. The baseline and standard RAG models performed poorly on the "Truthful Response %" metric from TruthfulQA, highlighting the inherent difficulty of the task. Standard RAG also showed limited grounding of its responses in retrieved knowledge.

**Future Work:**
Significant further research is needed to fully realize the potential of AUG-RAG. Key directions include:
1.  **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Conducting larger-scale experiments across diverse datasets (e.g., factual QA, open-ended generation) and employing extensive human evaluation to assess factuality, coherence, fluency, and the actual reduction of harmful hallucinations.
2.  **Advanced Uncertainty Estimation:** Investigating and developing more sophisticated UQ methods, including learned uncertainty predictors specifically tailored for triggering retrieval. Calibration of these uncertainty scores will also be crucial.
3.  **Dynamic Thresholding Mechanisms:** Developing and evaluating adaptive thresholding policies for the retrieval trigger, potentially using reinforcement learning, to optimize the balance between factuality improvement and retrieval cost across different contexts.
4.  **Enhanced Knowledge Integration:** Improving the methods by which retrieved information is integrated into the LLM's context to ensure better utilization and impact on the final output.
5.  **Broader Model Compatibility:** Testing AUG-RAG with a wider range of open-source and proprietary foundation models.
6.  **Multimodal Extension:** Adapting the AUG-RAG framework to multimodal foundation models, where uncertainty and hallucination across different modalities present unique challenges.

In conclusion, the AUG-RAG approach offers a promising direction for building more reliable and trustworthy LLMs by intelligently leveraging external knowledge only when needed. By addressing the critical challenge of hallucination in a resource-efficient manner, this research contributes to the broader goal of deploying foundation models more safely and effectively in real-world applications.
