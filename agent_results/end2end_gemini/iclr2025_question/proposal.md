## 1. Title: Adaptive Uncertainty-Gated Retrieval for Hallucination Mitigation in Foundation Models

## 2. Introduction

The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models across diverse and critical domains, including healthcare, law, finance, and autonomous systems, has highlighted a significant challenge: their propensity to "hallucinate" or generate factually incorrect information with unwarranted confidence (Ji et al., 2024). While these models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text generation, understanding, and even reasoning, their occasional detachment from factual reality undermines their reliability and trustworthiness. This issue is exacerbated by their inherent inability to consistently recognize their own knowledge boundaries. Current approaches to mitigate hallucinations, such as static retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or methods that filter outputs based on confidence, often suffer from being overly conservative—thereby stifling the models' creative potential—or failing to adapt to the nuanced and context-dependent nature of uncertainty (Varshney et al., 2023).

Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) emerges as a critical area of research to address these limitations. UQ aims to provide a reliable measure of a model's confidence in its outputs, enabling users and systems to discern when an LLM's generation is likely trustworthy and when human oversight or corrective mechanisms are necessary. As highlighted by the goals of the "Quantify Uncertainty and Hallucination in Foundation Models" workshop, there is an urgent need for scalable, computationally efficient UQ methods, robust theoretical underpinnings for uncertainty in generative models, and effective strategies for detecting and mitigating hallucinations.

This research proposal introduces an **Adaptive Uncertainty-Gated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (AUG-RAG)** system. The core idea is to dynamically trigger an external knowledge retrieval process only when the foundation model exhibits high internal uncertainty about its next generation step. By selectively grounding the model's outputs in factual data precisely when its internal knowledge is lacking or unreliable, AUG-RAG aims to significantly reduce hallucinations. Crucially, this adaptive mechanism is designed to preserve the model's fluency and creative capabilities during confident and factually sound generation phases, thereby striking a better balance between reliability and generative freedom.

**Research Objectives:**

The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  To design and implement a novel AUG-RAG framework that integrates an uncertainty estimation module, an adaptive retrieval trigger, and a knowledge integration mechanism with a base foundation model.
2.  To investigate and compare various uncertainty estimation techniques (e.g., predictive entropy, Monte Carlo dropout, learned uncertainty predictors) for their effectiveness and computational efficiency in signaling the need for retrieval in real-time generation.
3.  To develop and evaluate a dynamic, context-dependent thresholding mechanism for the retrieval trigger, allowing the system to adapt its grounding behavior based on the generation context and uncertainty dynamics.
4.  To empirically validate the AUG-RAG system's ability to reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy on diverse benchmarks, compared to baseline LLMs and standard RAG approaches.
5.  To assess the impact of the adaptive retrieval mechanism on the generation quality, including fluency, coherence, and creativity, ensuring that factuality improvements do not come at an unacceptable cost to these desirable LLM properties.
6.  To contribute to the development of best practices for integrating UQ into LLM workflows for enhanced reliability.

**Significance:**

This research directly addresses several key challenges identified in the workshop call. By focusing on an adaptive, uncertainty-driven approach to retrieval, it offers a pathway towards more scalable and computationally efficient UQ compared to methods requiring constant external lookups or complex ensemble architectures (Dey et al., 2025). The proposed system aims to directly mitigate hallucinations—a critical issue hindering LLM deployment—while preserving their creative strengths, a balance that current methods struggle to achieve. Furthermore, this work will contribute to establishing practical benchmarks and evaluation methodologies for UQ-driven interventions in generative models. Ultimately, the successful development of AUG-RAG will enhance the trustworthiness and safety of foundation models, paving the way for their more responsible deployment in high-stakes applications and fostering greater user confidence in AI-generated content.

## 3. Methodology

This research will follow a structured methodology encompassing system design, component development, comprehensive experimentation, and rigorous evaluation.

**A. System Architecture: Adaptive Uncertainty-Gated RAG (AUG-RAG)**

The proposed AUG-RAG system will consist of the following interconnected modules (Figure 1 - conceptual):

1.  **Base Foundation Model (LLM):** A state-of-the-art pre-trained autoregressive LLM (e.g., Llama-2, Mistral, or similar open-source models) will serve as the core generative engine. The choice will be guided by model accessibility, performance, and amenability to integration.
2.  **Uncertainty Estimation Module (UEM):** This module will assess the LLM's internal uncertainty at each potential token or segment generation step.
3.  **Adaptive Retrieval Trigger (ART):** Based on the uncertainty score from UEM and a dynamic threshold, this module will decide whether to activate the Retrieval Module.
4.  **Retrieval Module (RM):** If triggered, this standard RAG component will fetch relevant documents or snippets from an external Knowledge Base.
5.  **Knowledge Base (KB):** A corpus of factual information (e.g., a curated subset of Wikipedia, scientific articles, or domain-specific texts relevant to evaluation benchmarks).
6.  **Context Integration and Generation Module (CIGM):** This module will integrate the retrieved information into the LLM's current generation context, and the LLM will then proceed with generation based on this augmented context.

**B. Uncertainty Estimation Module (UEM)**

The UEM is critical for the adaptive nature of AUG-RAG. We will investigate several prominent and promising UQ techniques:

1.  **Predictive Entropy:** For a given context $C = (x, y_{<t})$ (prompt $x$ and previously generated tokens $y_{<t}$), and the LLM's predicted probability distribution $P(y_t | C)$ over the next token $y_t$ in the vocabulary $V$, the entropy is:
    $$H(P(y_t | C)) = - \sum_{v \in V} P(v | C) \log_2 P(v | C)$$
    Higher entropy suggests greater uncertainty. We will also explore variations, such as entropy of the top-k predictions or normalized entropy.

2.  **Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD):** Following Gal and Ghahramani (2016), dropout layers, if present in the LLM architecture, will be activated during inference. Multiple stochastic forward passes ($N_{mcd}$ samples) will be performed for the same input context $C$. Let $\{\mathbf{z}_1, \mathbf{z}_2, \dots, \mathbf{z}_{N_{mcd}}\}$ be the sets of output logits from these passes. Uncertainty can be quantified by:
    *   **Variance of logits:** $Var(\mathbf{z}_i)$ for each vocabulary item.
    *   **Variance of probabilities:** After applying softmax to logits, $Var(softmax(\mathbf{z}_i))$.
    *   **Mutual Information:** Capturing epistemic uncertainty by measuring the mutual information between the model parameters and the prediction.
    This approach aligns with the spirit of perturbation-based methods like SPUQ (Gao et al., 2024), though SPUQ focuses on input perturbations while MCD uses model perturbations.

3.  **Learned Uncertainty Predictor:** A small, auxiliary neural network will be trained to predict the probability that the LLM's next generated token (or segment) will be part of a hallucination or factually incorrect.
    *   **Input:** LLM's internal state (e.g., hidden states, attention weights), the current predictive distribution $P(y_t|C)$.
    *   **Output:** A scalar uncertainty score $U \in [0,1]$.
    *   **Training:** This requires labeled data where model generations are marked for factuality. We may leverage existing hallucination benchmarks or techniques like self-critique (Ji et al., 2023) to generate pseudo-labels.

4.  **Token-level Confidence Scores:** Based on the probability of the sampled token $P(y_t^{sampled}|C)$. Lower probability might indicate lower confidence. Normalization techniques (e.g., length normalization for sequences) will be explored. This is related to identifying "low-confidence generations" (Varshney et al., 2023).

The selection of the UQ method will consider accuracy in predicting errors, computational overhead, and ease of integration.

**C. Adaptive Retrieval Trigger (ART)**

The ART decides whether to engage the Retrieval Module.

1.  **Dynamic Uncertainty Threshold ($\tau_{uncertainty}$):** A key innovation is the dynamic adjustment of this threshold.
    *   **Global Dynamic Threshold:** $\tau_t = f(S_t)$, where $S_t$ is a summary of the generation state (e.g., overall uncertainty of the sequence generated so far, query type, or topic).
    *   **Context-Specific Learned Threshold:** We propose to learn the thresholding policy, potentially using reinforcement learning. The state could be $(C_t, U_t)$, where $U_t$ is the current uncertainty score. The action would be to retrieve or not. The reward function would balance factual accuracy improvements against the cost of retrieval and potential disruption to fluency.
    *   **Calibration-based Threshold:** The threshold could be set by calibrating the uncertainty scores on a validation set to achieve a target precision/recall for detecting potential hallucinations.
    *   **Simple Heuristics (Baselines):**
        *   Fixed threshold: $U_t > \tau
_{fixed}$.
        *   Rolling window average: Compare $U_t$ to an average uncertainty over the last $k$ tokens.

2.  **Triggering Logic:** Retrieval is initiated if $U_t > \tau_t$. We will also explore probabilistic triggering, where the probability of retrieval $P(\text{retrieve}) = \sigma(k(U_t - \tau_t))$, where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function and $k$ is a scaling factor.

**D. Retrieval Module (RM)**

This module will employ standard RAG techniques:

1.  **Knowledge Base (KB):** Initially, a processed Wikipedia dump. For domain-specific tasks, relevant corpora (e.g., PubMed for medical QA) will be used.
2.  **Retriever:** We will experiment with:
    *   **Dense Passage Retrievers (DPR):** Using pre-trained sentence transformers (e.g., Sentence-BERT) to encode the query (derived from $C_t$) and KB passages into embeddings for similarity search.
    *   **Sparse Retrievers:** BM25 as a robust baseline.
3.  **Document Selection:** The top-$k$ most relevant documents/passages will be retrieved. The optimal $k$ will be determined empirically.

**E. Context Integration and Generation Module (CIGM)**

Once documents $D_{retrieved} = \{d_1, d_2, \dots, d_k\}$ are fetched, they must be integrated into the LLM's context:

1.  **Concatenation:** The simplest approach is to prepend or intersperse snippets from $D_{retrieved}$ into the current input context for the LLM. For example, new context $C' = (D_{retrieved}, C)$.
2.  **Attention-based Fusion:** Explore mechanisms where the LLM can attend differently to the original context and the retrieved information, potentially weighting retrieved snippets based on their relevance or confidence.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** The LLM generates a candidate response; if uncertainty remains high or internal consistency checks (Mündler et al., 2023) with retrieved knowledge fail, further retrieval or refinement can occur.

The LLM then generates the next token(s) conditioned on this augmented context: $P(y_t | C, D_{retrieved})$.

**F. Data Collection and Preparation**

*   **Pre-trained LLMs:** We will use publicly available model weights.
*   **Knowledge Bases:** Standard Wikipedia dumps will be pre-processed. For specific tasks, curated datasets will be used (e.g., abstracts from PubMed Central for biomedical tasks).
*   **Training Data (for learned components):**
    *   For the learned uncertainty predictor or adaptive threshold, datasets with labeled hallucinations are needed. We will leverage:
        *   **TruthfulQA:** Contains questions designed to elicit imitative falsehoods.
        *   **HaluEval, FELM:** Benchmarks designed specifically for evaluating LLM hallucinations.
        *   Synthesized data: Using LLMs to generate responses and then using another powerful LLM (e.g., GPT-4) or human annotators to label factuality, similar to studies on self-correction (Ji et al., 2023).
*   **Evaluation Datasets:**
    *   **Factual QA:** Natural Questions, TriviaQA, WebQuestions, PopQA.
    *   **Hallucination-Specific:** TruthfulQA, HaluEval, FELM.
    *   **Open-ended Generation/Dialogue:** CommonsenseQA, WoW (Wizard of Wikipedia) to assess hallucination in conversational contexts and impact on creativity/flow.
    *   **NLI tasks (with retrieved evidence):** To check consistency between generation and retrieved facts.

        *   **Perplexity (PPL):** On held-out text, with caution as it doesn't directly measure factuality or creativity.
        *   **Diversity:** Metrics like distinct n-grams in generated responses.
        *   **Creativity & Engagement (for open-ended tasks):** Human evaluation.

    *   **Uncertainty Calibration:**
