**Title:** Adaptive AI Tutoring for Enhanced Human Cognitive Alignment with Complex AI Systems

**Motivation:** As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, it's crucial not only to align AI with human values but also to empower humans to understand and effectively collaborate with these systems. This "Aligning Humans with AI" aspect is vital for preserving human agency and ensuring AI benefits society. Current interfaces often lack mechanisms to help users build accurate mental models of AI reasoning, hindering effective partnership.

**Main Idea:** This research proposes developing an "AI Cognitive Tutor" module integrated within complex AI systems (e.g., in scientific discovery or medical diagnosis). When the AI detects a potential misalignment or misunderstanding from the human user (e.g., through unexpected inputs, repeated corrected actions, or explicit confusion signals), the tutor adaptively generates explanations, simplified analogies, or targeted micro-learning interventions about the AI's underlying logic, data assumptions, or uncertainty. The methodology involves: 1) Identifying user misunderstanding triggers. 2) Developing a library of adaptive tutoring strategies. 3) Using user feedback on the tutoring to refine both the tutoring module and potentially the AI's primary task explanations. Expected outcomes include improved user comprehension, more effective human-AI collaboration, and reduced errors stemming from misaligned mental models.
