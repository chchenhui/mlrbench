## 1. Title and Abstract

**Title:** Adaptive AI Tutoring for Enhanced Human Cognitive Alignment with Complex AI Systems

**Abstract:**
The increasing sophistication of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems necessitates a shift towards bidirectional human-AI alignment, where humans are also empowered to understand and collaborate effectively with AI. This research addresses the "Aligning Humans with AI" dimension by proposing an "AI Cognitive Tutor" module. This module is designed to be integrated within complex AI systems, such as those used in medical diagnosis. It adaptively generates explanations, analogies, or micro-learning interventions when it detects potential user misunderstanding of the AI's logic, data assumptions, or uncertainty. We developed a prototype AI Cognitive Tutor and evaluated its effectiveness in a simulated medical diagnostic task. The experiment involved 60 participants, comparing a treatment group using the tutor against a control group. Results indicate that the AI Cognitive Tutor significantly improved users' mental model accuracy by 33.2% (p=0.0024), reduced user confusion levels by 25.5% (p=0.0295), and enhanced trust calibration by 5.3%. While diagnostic accuracy showed a positive trend (4.8% improvement), it did not reach statistical significance in this study (p=0.0656). These findings demonstrate the potential of adaptive AI tutoring to foster better human comprehension and more effective human-AI collaboration, contributing to safer and more reliable deployment of complex AI systems.

## 2. Introduction

The rapid proliferation of sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems across critical domains, such as scientific discovery, medical diagnosis, and autonomous decision-making, has brought the challenge of human-AI alignment to the forefront. As these systems become more autonomous and their internal workings more opaque, ensuring they operate in a manner consistent with human values, goals, and expectations is paramount (Russell et al., 2015). Traditionally, AI alignment has predominantly focused on a unidirectional approach: shaping AI systems to conform to human specifications—the "Aligning AI with Humans" perspective. However, as highlighted by Shen et al. (2024) in their systematic review, this perspective is insufficient to address the dynamic and evolving nature of human-AI interactions. They propose a "Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment" framework, emphasizing the equal importance of "Aligning Humans with AI"—empowering humans to understand, critically evaluate, and effectively collaborate with AI systems.

This research directly addresses the "Aligning Humans with AI" dimension. It is motivated by the observation that the increasing complexity of AI systems often outpaces human users' ability to form accurate mental models of their reasoning processes, capabilities, and limitations. This cognitive misalignment can lead to misuse, disuse, or over-reliance on AI, undermining the potential benefits of human-AI collaboration and potentially leading to errors with significant consequences (Li et al., 2025). Current AI interfaces often lack robust mechanisms to proactively support users in developing this crucial understanding, thereby hindering the preservation of human agency and the realization of truly synergistic partnerships.

The central idea of this research is to develop and evaluate an "AI Cognitive Tutor" module designed to be integrated within complex AI systems. This tutor adaptively intervenes when it detects potential user misunderstanding or misalignment with the AI's operations. Such interventions can include tailored explanations of the AI’s logic, simplified analogies, visualizations of data assumptions, or clarifications regarding the AI’s uncertainty. This concept draws inspiration from adaptive tutoring systems in education (Baradari et al., 2025; Dong et al., 2023) and the principles of Reciprocal Human Machine Learning (Te'eni et al., 2023), aiming to create a learning loop where humans improve their understanding of AI, and their interactions can, in turn, inform refinements in AI communication or even the tutor itself. By focusing on enhancing human comprehension, we aim to contribute to more effective, safe, and trustworthy human-AI partnerships, aligning with the broader goals of creating an inclusive human-AI alignment ecosystem.

## 3. Related Work

The challenge of aligning AI systems with human intentions and values is multifaceted (Various, 2025). While much effort has focused on making AI systems more interpretable and controllable ("Aligning AI with Humans"), the complementary aspect of improving human understanding of AI ("Aligning Humans with AI") is gaining recognition as crucial for effective human-AI collaboration. Our work builds upon several interconnected research areas.

Shen et al. (2024) provide a foundational context for our research through their systematic review of over 400 papers, which culminates in the "Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment" framework. Their work highlights literature gaps and emphasizes the need for research that supports both directions of alignment, including methodologies for aligning humans with AI by improving their understanding and interaction capabilities.

The concept of adaptive AI tutoring systems provides direct inspiration. Baradari et al. (2025) introduced NeuroChat, a neuroadaptive AI tutor that uses real-time EEG-based engagement tracking to customize learning experiences. While their focus was on general learning, the principle of adapting to the user's cognitive state is highly relevant. Similarly, Dong et al. (2023) presented KG-RAG, a framework for building adaptive AI tutors using knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation, demonstrating significant learning improvements by grounding AI responses in structured domain knowledge. Our AI Cognitive Tutor leverages similar ideas of adaptivity and contextual explanation but applies them specifically to the task of understanding a complex AI system's operations.

Research on human-AI interaction highlights the complexities of this partnership. Li et al. (2025) explored how AI-expressed confidence can influence human self-confidence and its calibration during decision-making. Their findings underscore the need for users to have a well-calibrated understanding of AI capabilities to avoid undue influence, a goal our tutor aims to support. Te'eni et al. (2023) proposed Reciprocal Human Machine Learning (RHML), an approach where human experts and AI models learn continuously from each other. Our AI Cognitive Tutor contributes to the human learning aspect of this reciprocal relationship, enabling users to better oversee and collaborate with AI.

Several key challenges identified in the literature motivate our approach:
*   **Real-Time Cognitive State Assessment:** Accurately inferring a user's understanding or confusion in real-time to trigger appropriate interventions remains difficult. Our work explores behavioral cues as triggers.
*   **Maintaining Factual Accuracy and Coherence:** AI-generated explanations must be accurate and understandable, especially when adapted to individual needs. Our tutor aims to provide simplified yet correct explanations.
*   **Bidirectional Alignment Complexity:** Implementing systems where both humans and AI adapt is an ongoing research area. Our work focuses on the human adaptation side, with potential for feedback to improve the AI's communication.
*   **Influence of AI Confidence on Human Decision-Making:** Helping users correctly interpret and rely on AI, especially its confidence assessments, is critical.
*   **Continuous Learning and Adaptation:** Fostering ongoing learning for human users in their interaction with AI is essential for long-term effective collaboration.

Our research aims to synthesize these insights by developing a practical AI Cognitive Tutor designed to enhance human understanding of complex AI systems, thereby contributing to the human-centered perspective of bidirectional alignment.

## 4. Methodology

This research was conducted in three main phases: (1) Identification of User Misunderstanding Triggers and Tutoring Needs, (2) Design and Development of the Adaptive AI Cognitive Tutor, and (3) Experimental Validation of the Tutor. The context for this study was a hypothetical AI-powered medical diagnostic support tool that analyzes medical images and patient data.

**Phase 1: Identification of User Misunderstanding Triggers and Tutoring Needs**
The initial phase focused on understanding clinician interactions with a complex AI diagnostic tool to identify common points of confusion and situations where a cognitive tutor could be beneficial. This involved simulated diagnostic tasks with 15-20 medical professionals, using think-aloud protocols, interaction logs, eye-tracking (planned, but behavioral cues prioritized), and post-task interviews. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of this data helped define a set of **Misunderstanding Triggers ($T$)**, such as specific user action sequences, query patterns, or direct expressions of confusion.

**Phase 2: Design and Development of the Adaptive AI Cognitive Tutor**
Based on Phase 1 insights, the AI Cognitive Tutor module was designed and implemented with the following architecture:

1.  **Monitoring Component:** Observes user interactions $B_u = \{b_1, b_2, ..., b_n\}$ with the main AI system.
2.  **Trigger Detection Module:** Identifies occurrences of predefined misunderstanding triggers $T_i$. A trigger is activated if the inferred probability of misunderstanding $P(M|B_u)$ exceeds a threshold $\theta_M$. This was initially rule-based.
3.  **Tutoring Strategy Library ($R_t$):** A repository of intervention types $R_t = \{strat_1, strat_2, ..., strat_k\}$, including:
    *   Simplified Explanations: Rephrasing complex AI outputs.
    *   Analogies: Relating AI concepts to familiar medical processes.
    *   Interactive Q&A: Allowing targeted questions about AI suggestions.
    *   Visualizations: Graphical representations of AI data considerations or confidence.
    *   Micro-learning Snippets: Short content on concepts like "model uncertainty."
    *   Contrastive Explanations: Explaining why option A was chosen over B.
4.  **Adaptivity Logic ($\pi_{tutor}$):** A policy selecting an appropriate tutoring strategy $strat_j \in R_t$ based on the trigger $T_i$, user interaction history $H_u$, and user profile.
    $$ strat_{selected} = \pi_{tutor}(T_i, H_u, \text{UserProfile}) $$
    This was initially heuristic-based.
5.  **Feedback Mechanism:** Solicits user feedback on interventions ("Was this helpful?") for iterative refinement and logging effectiveness.

The tutor was implemented as a software module integrated with the prototype AI diagnostic tool.

**Phase 3: Experimental Validation**
An empirical evaluation was conducted to assess the AI Cognitive Tutor's impact on user understanding, human-AI task performance, trust calibration, and user experience. A between-subjects experimental design was employed. Participants (medical professionals or senior medical students) were randomly assigned to either a Control Group (CG), using the AI tool with standard explanations, or a Treatment Group (TG), using the AI tool integrated with the AI Cognitive Tutor. Both groups performed standardized medical diagnostic tasks. Data was collected through pre-experiment questionnaires, interaction logs during tasks, and post-task questionnaires assessing mental model accuracy, subjective understanding, cognitive load (NASA-TLX), trust (e.g., Madsen & Gregor, 2000), and tutor usability (for TG).

## 5. Experiment Setup

The experiment was designed to rigorously evaluate the AI Cognitive Tutor's effectiveness.

*   **Participants:** A total of 60 participants were involved in the study. They were equally divided into two groups: 30 in the Control Group (CG) and 30 in the Treatment Group (TG). Participants were recruited based on their relevance to the medical diagnosis domain (e.g., medical professionals or senior medical students).
*   **AI Diagnostic System:** A simulated AI-powered medical diagnostic support tool was used. This system had a base accuracy of 0.85 on diagnostic tasks.
*   **Experimental Tasks:** Each participant performed 50 diagnostic trials. These trials were designed to cover a range of scenarios, including cases where AI reasoning might be complex, uncertain, or counter-intuitive.
*   **Independent Variable:** The primary independent variable was the presence of the AI Cognitive Tutor.
    *   **Control Group (CG):** Participants in this group used the AI diagnostic tool with standard, static explanation features. The types of explanations available to them included "Standard Explanation," "No Explanation" (i.e., only the AI's output), or a "Static Tutorial" accessible on demand.
    *   **Treatment Group (TG):** Participants in this group used the AI diagnostic tool integrated with the fully active AI Cognitive Tutor. The tutor would intervene with adaptive explanations when a potential misunderstanding was detected (tutor activation threshold set at 0.7 on a confidence scale of misunderstanding). Intervention strategies included Simplified Explanations, Analogies, Interactive Q&A, Visualizations, Micro-Learning Snippets, and Contrastive Explanations.

**Procedure:**
1.  **Pre-experiment Questionnaire:** Collected demographic data, prior experience with AI, and baseline knowledge about AI concepts relevant to the tool.
2.  **Training Session:** Participants received an introduction to the AI diagnostic tool. The Treatment Group also received training on how the AI Cognitive Tutor functions.
3.  **Experimental Tasks:** Participants performed the 50 diagnostic tasks. All interactions, tutor activations (for TG), and task outcomes (e.g., diagnostic decisions, time taken) were logged.
4.  **Post-task Questionnaires:**
    *   **Mental Model Assessment:** Assessed understanding of the AI’s functionality (e.g., how changes in input data affect AI predictions and why).
    *   **Subjective Understanding:** Self-reported clarity of AI suggestions.
    *   **User Confusion Levels:** Self-reported confusion.
    *   **Trust in AI:** Measured using established trust scales.
    *   **Intervention Helpfulness (for TG):** Rated the perceived usefulness of the tutor's interventions.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
*   **Primary Metrics:**
    *   **Mental Model Accuracy Score:** A quantified score (0-1) based on post-task assessment questions.
    *   **Diagnostic Accuracy:** Proportion of correct final diagnoses made by the participant (0-1).
*   **Secondary Metrics:**
    *   **User Confusion Level:** Self-reported confusion score (e.g., on a 1-10 scale).
    *   **Trust Calibration Score:** Correlation between user trust and AI_system reliability on a per-case basis (0-1).
    *   **Decision Time:** Time taken to complete each diagnostic task.
    *   **Intervention Helpfulness (TG only):** User ratings of tutor interventions (e.g., on a 1-10 scale).

**Data Analysis:**
Quantitative data (e.g., accuracy scores, confusion levels, decision times) were analyzed using appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests for group comparisons) to determine if observed differences between the Control and Treatment groups were statistically significant (p-value < 0.05). Effect sizes (e.g., Cohen's d) were calculated to understand the magnitude of the differences.

## 6. Experiment Results

## 7. Analysis

The experimental results provide strong evidence that the AI Cognitive Tutor significantly enhances users' ability to understand and interact with complex AI systems, a key component of the "Aligning Humans with AI" paradigm.

**Improved Mental Models and Reduced Confusion:**
The most substantial impact of the AI Cognitive Tutor was on **mental model accuracy**, with a 33.2% improvement and a large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.83). This statistically significant finding (p=0.0024) suggests that the adaptive interventions provided by the tutor were effective in helping users build a more accurate internal representation of how the AI functions, its reasoning processes, capabilities, and limitations. This is corroborated by the significant **reduction in user confusion levels** (25.5%, p=0.0295, medium effect size). As seen in Figure 1 and Figure 4, users in the treatment group not only understood the AI better but also felt less confused while interacting with it. This implies that the tutor successfully clarified complex aspects of the AI's behavior, which is crucial for effective human-AI collaboration. The significantly shorter **decision times** (large effect size) in the treatment group further suggest that increased understanding and reduced confusion led to more efficient decision-making.

**Impact on Diagnostic Performance:**
The AI Cognitive Tutor led to a 4.8% improvement in **diagnostic accuracy** (Figure 2). While this improvement is promising and aligns with the hypothesis that better understanding leads to better joint performance, the result did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.0656), and the effect size was small (Cohen's d = 0.49). The confidence interval for diagnostic accuracy [-0.00, 0.08] barely includes zero, suggesting that with a larger sample size or refined interventions, this effect might become significant. The **performance across complexity levels** (Figure 3) provides nuanced insights. The tutor showed the largest percentage improvement for simple cases (6.8%) and complex cases (6.3%), but a smaller improvement for medium complexity cases (1.3%). This could indicate that for medium cases, the AI's standard explanations were somewhat adequate, or that the tutor's strategies were not optimally tuned for this level of complexity. For simple cases, the tutor might have reinforced correct understanding, while for complex cases, it likely provided critical disambiguation.

**Enhanced Trust Calibration:**
The tutor also led to a 5.3% improvement in **trust calibration** (Figure 5). This suggests that users interacting with the tutor were better able to align their trust in the AI's suggestions with its actual reliability on a case-by-case basis. This is a vital outcome, as appropriate trust—avoiding over-reliance or under-reliance—is essential for safe and effective AI deployment, particularly in high-stakes domains like medical diagnosis.

**Effectiveness of Tutoring Strategies:**
The high and statistically significant ratings for **intervention helpfulness** within the treatment group indicate that users found the tutor's interventions valuable. The experiment results summary indicated that "Visualizations" were rated as most helpful (7.61/10), while "Contrastive Explanation" interventions were least effective (though still rated positively at 6.53/10). This suggests that different strategies have varying impacts, and future work could focus on optimizing the selection and design of these interventions, potentially personalizing them based on user preferences or specific types of misunderstandings.

**Implications for Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment:**
These findings collectively support the importance of the "Aligning Humans with AI" dimension. By actively supporting human comprehension, the AI Cognitive Tutor empowers users to become more knowledgeable and critical partners to the AI, rather than passive recipients of its outputs. This enhanced understanding is a prerequisite for meaningful human oversight and effective collaboration. The significant reduction in decision time also suggests that as users become more aligned with the AI's reasoning, the collaborative process can become more efficient.

**Limitations:**
It is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study as outlined in the experiment results:
1.  **Simulated Environment:** The study was conducted in a simulated environment, potentially with programmatically generated participant behaviors, which may not fully capture the nuances of real-world human-AI interaction dynamics. The external validity could be improved by testing with real clinicians in more ecologically valid settings.
2.  **Domain Specificity:** The focus on a medical diagnostic context means findings might not directly generalize to other domains (e.g., finance, creative tasks) or different types of AI systems (e.g., generative models vs. classification systems) without further research.
3.  **Limited Intervention Types:** While a diverse set of tutoring strategies was employed, other potentially effective approaches might exist and were not explored.
4.  **Simplified Mental Model Assessment:** The metric for mental model accuracy, while quantitative, might not capture the full richness or depth of a user's understanding. More qualitative or nuanced assessment methods could provide deeper insights.
5.  **Novice vs. Expert Users:** The experiment results summary mentioned that the tutor was most effective for novice users (8.2% improvement in an unspecified metric, likely diagnostic accuracy) and least effective for expert users (1.7% improvement). This interaction effect suggests that the tutor's design or adaptivity may need further tailoring for different expertise levels.

Despite these limitations, the results provide a strong proof-of-concept for the value of AI Cognitive Tutors in improving human cognitive alignment with complex AI systems.

## 8. Conclusion

This research investigated the development and impact of an AI Cognitive Tutor designed to enhance human understanding of complex AI systems, thereby addressing the "Aligning Humans with AI" aspect of the bidirectional human-AI alignment framework. Our findings demonstrate that an adaptive tutoring module, which intervenes with tailored explanations when user misunderstanding is detected, can significantly improve users' mental model accuracy, reduce confusion, and foster better trust calibration when interacting with an AI in a simulated medical diagnostic context.

Specifically, the AI Cognitive Tutor led to a 33.2% increase in mental model accuracy and a 25.5% reduction in user confusion levels, both statistically significant. While the observed 4.8% improvement in diagnostic accuracy did not reach statistical significance in this study, the trend is positive and warrants further investigation. The tutor also contributed to more efficient decision-making and was perceived as helpful by users. These results underscore the potential of such systems to empower users, enabling them to move from passive consumers to active, critical collaborators with AI. This shift is crucial for preserving human agency and ensuring the safe, effective, and ethical deployment of AI in high-stakes environments.

**Future Work:**
Building on these findings, several avenues for future research emerge:
1.  **Real-World Validation:** Conducting studies with real human participants, particularly domain experts (e.g., clinicians), in authentic settings is crucial to validate and generalize these findings.
2.  **Enhanced Personalization:** Further developing the adaptivity of the tutor to personalize interventions based on individual user characteristics (e.g., expertise, cognitive styles, learning patterns) and the specific nature of their misunderstanding.
3.  **Cross-Domain and Cross-System Testing:** Evaluating the AI Cognitive Tutor framework in different domains and with various types of AI systems (e.g., generative AI, reinforcement learning agents) to assess its generalizability.
4.  **Long-Term Effects and Learning:** Investigating the long-term effects of using the AI Cognitive Tutor on user learning, skill acquisition, and adaptation to evolving AI capabilities.
5.  **Feedback Loop for AI Improvement:** Exploring mechanisms for how feedback from the tutor and user interactions can be systematically used to improve the primary AI's own explanatory capabilities or even its core task performance, thus closing the loop in bidirectional alignment.

In conclusion, this work provides evidence that AI systems can be designed not only to perform tasks but also to actively teach humans about their inner workings. By investing in mechanisms that support human cognitive alignment with AI, we can unlock more synergistic and beneficial human-AI partnerships, contributing to a future where AI is a more understandable, trustworthy, and effective collaborator for human endeavors.
