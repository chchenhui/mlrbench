**Key Challenges:**

1. **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Continual learning systems often struggle with retaining previously learned knowledge when adapting to new tasks, leading to significant performance degradation.

2. **Balancing Stability and Plasticity**: Achieving a balance between maintaining existing knowledge (stability) and incorporating new information (plasticity) is crucial yet challenging in continual learning scenarios.

3. **Parameter Efficiency**: Developing methods that allow efficient adaptation without excessive computational and memory overhead is essential, especially when dealing with large foundation models.

4. **Task Heterogeneity**: Continual learning systems must effectively handle diverse and heterogeneous tasks, requiring flexible and adaptive learning strategies.

5. **Optimal Initialization and Update Strategies**: Determining the best initialization and update mechanisms for adapter modules to facilitate rapid and effective personalization remains a significant challenge.
