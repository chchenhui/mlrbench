**Title:** Meta-Learned Personalized Adapters for Efficient Continual Learning

**Motivation:** Foundation models struggle with efficient personalization and continual adaptation to individual user data streams without incurring catastrophic forgetting or requiring costly full re-training. This research aims to enable rapid, memory-efficient adaptation for personalized experiences by meta-learning how to best initialize and update compact adapter modules.

**Main Idea:** We propose a meta-learning framework where a meta-learner optimizes the initialization strategy and update dynamics for small, personalized adapter modules integrated with a frozen core foundation model. During meta-training, the system encounters diverse simulated user adaptation "episodes," learning to quickly specialize adapters while preserving general knowledge. For new users, the meta-learned parameters provide an optimal starting point for their dedicated adapter, which is then efficiently fine-tuned on their specific data stream using the learned update rule. Expected outcomes include drastically reduced computational overhead and time for personalization, minimized catastrophic forgetting, and enhanced performance on user-specific tasks, fostering truly adaptive and evolving foundation models.
