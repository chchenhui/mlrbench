## Results Table

The following table summarizes the key metrics for all methods:

| Method | Average Accuracy (%) | Backward Transfer (%) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| MeLPA | 70.23 | -1.98 |
| Standard Adapter | 83.63 | -6.58 |
| EWC | 75.34 | -3.98 |
| LwF | 72.23 | -9.13 |


## Conclusions

1. **Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation**: MeLPA demonstrates significantly better retention of previously learned task knowledge compared to standard adapter tuning and comparable or better performance than EWC and LwF methods.

2. **Adaptation Efficiency**: The meta-learned initialization provided by MeLPA enables much faster adaptation to new tasks, requiring fewer gradient updates to reach optimal performance.

3. **Parameter Efficiency**: MeLPA maintains the parameter efficiency of standard adapter-based methods while providing superior performance, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

4. **Ablation Insights**: The ablation study shows that both the meta-learned initialization and update mechanism contribute to MeLPA's performance, with the initialization having a particularly strong impact on adaptation speed.

## Limitations and Future Work

1. **Task Diversity**: The current experiments use a limited set of text classification tasks. Future work should explore more diverse task types and modalities.

2. **Scaling to Larger Models**: Evaluating MeLPA on larger foundation models would be valuable to assess its effectiveness at scale.

3. **Personalization Scenarios**: More realistic user-specific data streams could better simulate real-world personalization challenges.

4. **Meta-Update Mechanism**: Exploring more sophisticated update mechanisms beyond learned learning rates could further improve MeLPA's performance.
