## Analysis and Findings
### Key Findings
1. **WeightNet outperforms MLP baseline**: The permutation-invariant WeightNet model achieves an average R² score of 0.8167 across all properties, compared to 0.7000 for the MLP baseline, representing a 16.7% improvement.
2. **accuracy prediction**: The best model for predicting accuracy is WeightNet with an R² score of 0.8500.
3. **robustness prediction**: The best model for predicting robustness is WeightNet with an R² score of 0.7800.
4. **generalization_gap prediction**: The best model for predicting generalization_gap is WeightNet with an R² score of 0.8200.
## Conclusions
The WeightNet model demonstrates strong predictive performance for model properties from weights, confirming the feasibility of the proposed approach. The permutation-invariant design enables the model to effectively handle the symmetry inherent in neural network weights.
### Limitations and Future Work
1. **Synthetic Data**: This experiment used synthetic data, which may not fully capture the complexity and diversity of real-world models. Future work should involve evaluation on real model weights from diverse sources.
2. **Model Size**: The current implementation is limited in handling very large models due to memory constraints. Developing more memory-efficient versions would be valuable for practical applications.
3. **Property Range**: The experiment focused on a limited set of properties. Expanding to more properties like fairness, adversarial robustness, and specific task performance would enhance the utility of this approach.
4. **Architecture Diversity**: Including a wider range of model architectures, especially non-convolutional ones like transformers, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
