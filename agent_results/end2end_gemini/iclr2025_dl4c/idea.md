**Title:** Interactive Execution-Trace Alignment for Robust Code Generation

**Motivation:** Large language models for code (Code LLMs) often generate syntactically correct but semantically flawed code. Current alignment methods may not fully capture the nuanced feedback from actual program execution. This research aims to improve code generation reliability by directly incorporating iterative execution feedback into the model's post-training.

**Main Idea:** We propose an alignment framework where a Code LLM's generated code snippets are immediately executed in a sandboxed environment. Detailed execution traces, including runtime errors, exceptions, and intermediate variable states (when non-deterministic or erroneous), are captured. This rich feedback, much like a developer debugging, is then used to fine-tune the model. Techniques like Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) will be adapted, where "preferences" are derived from successful versus failed/buggy execution paths. Expected outcomes include models that learn to anticipate common runtime issues and produce more robust, executable code, significantly reducing debugging time.
