**1. Title: Interactive Execution-Trace Alignment for Robust and Reliable Code Generation**

**2. Introduction**

The advent of Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs) has marked a significant leap in automating software development tasks, offering capabilities ranging from code completion and synthesis to bug detection and repair (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021). These models, often pre-trained on vast repositories of code, can generate syntactically valid code snippets with remarkable fluency. However, a persistent challenge lies in their semantic understanding and reliability; Code LLMs frequently produce code that, while appearing correct, harbors subtle bugs, runtime errors, or fails to meet the intended functional requirements (Nguyen & Nadi, 2022). This gap between syntactic correctness and semantic reliability necessitates robust post-training alignment techniques.

Current alignment strategies for Code LLMs often rely on feedback mechanisms such as human preferences (Ouyang et al., 2022), compiler outputs (Dou et al., 2024; Jain et al., 2023), or unit test results (Liu et al., 2023). While these methods have shown promise, they may not fully capture the nuanced, fine-grained information available from the actual execution dynamics of the generated code. For instance, unit tests provide a binary pass/fail signal or limited error messages, while compiler feedback focuses on static errors. The rich tapestry of information revealed during program execution – runtime exceptions, aberrant control flows, unexpected intermediate variable states, and performance bottlenecks (Peng et al., 2024) – offers a more detailed "debugging-like" perspective that could significantly enhance model learning.

This research proposes a novel alignment framework, **Interactive Execution-Trace Alignment (IETA)**, designed to improve the robustness and reliability of code generated by LLMs. The core idea is to iteratively refine Code LLMs by directly leveraging detailed execution traces. Generated code snippets will be executed in a secure, sandboxed environment, and comprehensive traces encompassing runtime errors, exceptions, and critical intermediate variable states (particularly those preceding or contributing to erroneous behavior) will be systematically captured. This rich, context-aware feedback, analogous to the information a human developer uses during debugging, will then be used to fine-tune the model. We will adapt advanced preference-based reinforcement learning techniques, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) or Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), where preferences are meticulously derived from comparing successful execution paths against those leading to failures or suboptimal outcomes.

This research directly addresses several key challenges highlighted in the "Emergent Possibilities and Challenges in Deep Learning for Code" workshop, particularly in "Post-training and Alignment for Code" and "Benchmarking and Evaluation for Code." By focusing on execution-derived feedback, we aim to bridge the gap between generated code and its real-world behavior, pushing the boundaries of model alignment methodologies.

**Research Objectives:**

The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **To develop a framework for systematic capture and representation of detailed execution traces:** This includes runtime errors, exceptions, relevant stack information, and critical intermediate variable states from executed code snippets generated by LLMs.
2.  **To adapt and implement preference-based alignment algorithms (DPO/RLAIF) that leverage execution-trace feedback:** This involves designing methods to transform detailed execution traces into preference signals (e.g., pairs of "better" and "worse" code executions) suitable for fine-tuning Code LLMs.
3.  **To empirically evaluate the effectiveness of IETA in improving code generation quality:** This will be measured by the robustness (reduced runtime errors), correctness (pass rates on functional tests), and overall reliability of the generated code compared to baseline models and existing alignment techniques.
4.  **To investigate the model's ability to learn to anticipate and avoid common runtime pitfalls:** We aim to demonstrate that models aligned with IETA develop an implicit understanding of dynamic execution behavior, leading to the generation of more proactively robust code.

**Significance:**

The successful development of the IETA framework is poised to have a significant impact on the field of deep learning for code. By producing Code LLMs that generate more robust and reliable code, this research can:

*   **Enhance Developer Productivity:** Significantly reduce the time and effort developers spend on debugging and correcting LLM-generated code, allowing them to focus on higher-level design and problem-solving.
*   **Improve Software Reliability:** Contribute to the creation of more dependable software systems by minimizing the introduction of runtime errors and unexpected behaviors originating from AI-generated code.
*   **Advance LLM Alignment Techniques:** Introduce a novel and powerful feedback modality – detailed execution traces – for aligning LLMs, potentially inspiring similar approaches in other domains where model outputs have executable consequences.
*   **Address Key Research Challenges:** This work directly tackles the challenge of incorporating execution feedback (Key Challenge 1 from the literature review) and aims to improve alignment with human intent (Key Challenge 5) by focusing on executable, error-free code. It also contributes to better "Benchmarking and Evaluation for Code" by emphasizing runtime behavior.
*   **Foster Open Science:** In line with the workshop's emphasis, we plan to release artifacts such as the IETA framework code, evaluation scripts, and potentially newly curated datasets or benchmarks derived from this research, promoting transparency and reproducibility.

This research endeavors to make Code LLMs not just fluent synthesizers of code, but more dependable partners in the software development lifecycle.

**3. Methodology**

This research will be conducted in three main phases: (1) Development of the Execution-Trace Capture and Feedback Formulation System, (2) Implementation and Adaptation of Alignment Algorithms, and (3) Rigorous Experimental Evaluation.

**3.1. Execution-Trace Capture and Feedback Formulation**

This phase focuses on creating the infrastructure to generate code, execute it, capture detailed traces, and transform these traces into a usable feedback signal.

*   **Code Generation and Execution Environment:**
    *   **Base Code LLM:** We will utilize a state-of-the-art pre-trained Code LLM (e.g., CodeLlama, StarCoder, or similar open-source models) as the foundation for our alignment process.
    *   **Task Definition:** Initial experiments will focus on function-level code generation tasks from standard benchmarks like HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), MBPP (Austin et al., 2021), and potentially more complex problems from APPS (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Prompts will typically consist of natural language descriptions and function signatures.
    *   **Sandboxed Execution:** Code snippets generated by the LLM will be executed in a secure, isolated sandboxed environment (e.g., using Docker containers with restricted permissions and resource limits – CPU, memory, time). This is crucial for safety and to prevent unintended side effects. The environment will support execution of common programming languages (primarily Python for initial studies, with potential extension to others like JavaScript or Java).
    *   **Trace Instrumentation and Capture:** We will employ a combination of techniques:
        *   **Standard Error/Output Capture:** stdout, stderr will be logged for basic error messages and program output.
        *   **Exception Handling:** Comprehensive logging of unhandled exceptions, including type, message, and full stack trace.
        *   **Debugging Hooks & Tracing Tools:** For Python, tools like `sys.settrace` or custom decorators can be used to instrument code execution at a granular level. We will focus on capturing:
            *   Values of variables on the lines indicated in stack traces leading to an error.
            *   Values of variables involved in assertion failures or specific error conditions (e.g., `IndexError`, `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`).
            *   Input arguments and return values of critical function calls within the generated snippet.
        *   **Conditional State Logging:** To manage the volume of trace data, logging of intermediate variable states will be primarily triggered by erroneous or exceptional events. For instance, if an error occurs, we will attempt to log the state of local variables in the current and preceding frames.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Basic monitoring of execution time and memory usage will be implemented, which can provide an additional signal for "inefficient" but otherwise correct code.

*   **Feedback Formulation:**
    The raw execution trace, $T$, for a generated code snippet $c$ given a prompt $p$, needs to be processed into a structured feedback signal suitable for the alignment algorithms.
    *   **Trace Classification:** Each trace $T$ will be classified based on execution outcome:
        1.  **Successful Execution ($S_{succ}$):** Code compiles, runs to completion without runtime errors, and (if unit tests are available and part of the execution context) passes all tests.
        2.  **Runtime Error ($S_{err}$):** Code compiles but crashes during execution (e.g., `NullPointerException`, `IndexOutOfBounds`, division by zero). The trace will contain error type, message, and stack.
        3.  **Compilation Error ($S_{comp\_err}$):** Code fails to compile. (Less focus, as pre-trained models are often syntactically good, but good to capture).
        4.  **Timeout/Resource Exhaustion ($S_{timeout}$):** Code runs indefinitely or consumes excessive resources.
        5.  **Incorrect Output ($S_{fail\_test}$):** Code runs successfully but produces incorrect results according to provided unit tests or oracle.
    *   **Preference Signal Generation:** The core of our feedback will be preference pairs $(c_w, c_l)$, where $c_w$ is a "winning" (preferred) code snippet and $c_l$ is a "losing" (dispreferred) code snippet for the same prompt $p$. Preferences will be derived as follows:
        *   $S_{succ}$ is always preferred over $S_{err}$, $S_{comp\_err}$, $S_{timeout}$, or $S_{fail\_test}$.
        *   Between two error states, heuristics might be used (e.g., code that executes further before crashing might be mildly preferred over code that crashes earlier, or an error from a deeper part of a complex task might be preferred over a trivial syntax error if both are somehow generated by later stages of fine-tuning). This requires careful design.
        *   For subtle differences, detailed trace analysis will be key. For example, if $c_1$ produces $S_{err}$ with `IndexError` and $c_2$ produces $S_{err}$ with `TypeError` for the same prompt, the trace information (variables involved, line numbers) would be part of the input to decide if a preference exists or if they are incomparable/equally bad from this single data point.
        *   Initially, we will prioritize clear-cut preferences: (successful execution vs. any error), (error with detailed trace vs. timeout with no trace).
    *   **Trace Summarization (for RLAIF reward model):** If using RLAIF, the trace $T$ itself (or a summary) might be used to train a reward model. A summary could be a textual description: "Code threw IndexError on line 5. Variable 'my_list' was empty, index was 0." or a structured object.

**3.2. Adaptation of Alignment Algorithms**

We will primarily focus on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) due to its stability and direct use of preference pairs. RLAIF will be explored as an alternative or complementary approach.

*   **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO):**
    DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) directly optimizes the LLM policy $\pi_\theta$ to align with given preferences, bypassing the need for an explicit reward model. The DPO loss function is:
    $$L_{DPO}(\pi_\theta; \pi_{ref}) = -\mathbb{E}_{(p, c_w, c_l) \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \log \sigma \left( \beta \left( \log \frac{\pi_\theta(c_w|p)}{\pi_{ref}(c_w|p)} - \log \frac{\pi_\theta(c_l|p)}{\pi_{ref}(c_l|p)} \right) \right) \right]$$
    where:
    *   $\mathcal{D}$ is the dataset of preference tuples $(p, c_w, c_l)$, with $p$ being the prompt, $c_w$ the preferred generated code, and $c_l$ the dispreferred generated code.
    *   $\pi_\theta$ is the policy (LLM) being fine-tuned.
    *   $\pi_{ref}$ is a reference policy, typically the initial SFT model before DPO.
    *   $\beta$ is a hyperparameter controlling the deviation from the reference policy.
    *   $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.

    **Application:**
    1.  **Data Generation for DPO:** For a given prompt $p$, we generate multiple code samples $\{c_1, c_2, ..., c_k\}$ from the current model $\pi_\theta$.
    2.  Each $c_i$ is executed, and its trace $T_i$ is captured.
    3.  Based on $T_i$ and $T_j$, preference pairs $(c_w, c_l)$ are formed. For example, if $c_i$ results in $S_{succ}$ and $c_j$ results in $S_{err}$, then $(c_i, c_j)$ is a preference pair.
    4.  These pairs form the dataset $\mathcal{D}$ for DPO training.
    5.  The model $\pi_\theta$ is updated iteratively using this dataset.

*   **Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) (Optional/Comparative):**
    RLAIF involves training a reward model $R_\phi(p, c, T)$ that predicts the quality of a code snippet $c$ for prompt $p$ given its execution trace $T$.
    1.  **Reward Model Training:** Using the collected $(p, c, T)$ tuples and their classifications (e.g., $S_{succ}$, $S_{err}$), train a reward model. This model could take the prompt, generated code, and a representation of the execution trace (e.g., error type, key variable states as text) as input. The reward model can be trained on pairwise preference data as well: $R_\phi(p, c_w, T_w) > R_\phi(p, c_l, T_l)$.
        $$ L_{Reward} = -\mathbb{E}_{(p, c_w, T_w, c_l, T_l) \sim \mathcal{D_R}} \left[ \log \sigma (R_\phi(p, c_w, T_w) - R_\phi(p, c_l, T_l)) \right] $$
    2.  **Policy Fine-tuning (e.g., PPO):** The Code LLM $\pi_\theta$ is then fine-tuned using PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) to maximize the expected reward from $R_\phi$:
        $$ \text{Objective: } \mathbb{E}_{p \sim \mathcal{P}, c \sim \pi_\theta(\cdot|p)} [R_\phi(p, c, \text{execute}(c))] - \alpha \cdot \text{KL}(\pi_\theta(\cdot|p) || \pi_{ref}(\cdot|p)) $$
        The KL divergence term penalizes large deviations from the reference policy.

*   **Iterative Refinement:** The overall process is iterative:
    1.  Start with a pre-trained/SFT Code LLM.
    2.  **Loop:**
        a.  Generate code samples for a batch of prompts.
        b.  Execute samples and capture traces.
        c.  Formulate preference pairs (for DPO) or (code, trace, reward_signal) tuples (for RLAIF reward model training).
        d.  Update the LLM policy $\pi_\theta$ using DPO or PPO with the learned reward model.
    This iterative loop allows the model to progressively learn from its mistakes and successes, guided by the rich feedback from execution traces. This iterative, feedback-driven refinement is what makes the process "interactive" from the model's learning perspective.

**3.3. Experimental Design and Evaluation**

Rigorous evaluation is critical to validate the IETA framework.

*   **Datasets and Benchmarks:**
    *   **Standard Benchmarks:** HumanEval, MBPP, APPS will be used for evaluation. These provide functional tests that allow for pass@k calculation.
    *   **Custom Datasets (Potential):** We may curate a small dataset of programming problems known to elicit common runtime errors to specifically test robustness improvements.
*   **Baseline Models:**
    1.  **Base Pre-trained LLM:** The original Code LLM without any IETA fine-tuning.
    2.  **Supervised Fine-Tuned (SFT) LLM:** The base LLM fine-tuned on high-quality code solutions, if not already part of the base model.
    3.  **LLMs with Alternative Feedback:**
        *   Models fine-tuned with simpler execution feedback (e.g., binary pass/fail from unit tests, as in RLTF (Liu et al., 2023)).
        *   Models fine-tuned with compiler feedback (e.g., StepCoder (Dou et al., 2024) principles, if feasible to re-implement a variant).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Primary Metrics:**
        *   **Pass@k:** The standard metric for code generation, measuring functional correctness (Chen et al., 2021). We will analyze pass@1, pass@10, pass@100.
        *   **Execution Rate / Robustness Rate:** Percentage of generated code snippets that execute without any runtime errors (regardless of functional correctness). This is a direct measure of robustness.
        *   **Error Type Frequency:** Analysis of common runtime error types produced by different models (Is IETA reducing specific frequent errors?).
    *   **Secondary Metrics:**
        *   **CodeBLEU/CrystalBLEU:** Syntactic similarity to reference solutions, though less emphasized as our focus is semantic correctness and robustness.
        *   **Qualitative Analysis:** Manual inspection of generated code and error traces to understand the kinds of improvements (or new failure modes) introduced by IETA.
        *   **Debugging Effort (Proxy):** While hard to automate, we might conduct small-scale human studies where developers are asked to fix code generated by baseline vs. IETA models, measuring time-to-fix.
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    *   **Impact of Trace Granularity:** Compare models trained with full traces vs. traces with only error messages vs. traces with variable states.
    *   **DPO vs. RLAIF:** Compare the performance and stability of DPO and RLAIF within the IETA framework.
    *   **Effectiveness of specific trace components:** Analyze if feedback about certain error types or variable states is more impactful.
    *   **Impact of $\beta$ in DPO:** Sensitivity analysis for the DPO hyperparameter.

Addressing specific literature challenges:
*   **Key Challenge 1 (Incorporating Execution Feedback):** This methodology directly addresses this by a structured approach to capture, process, and utilize detailed traces.
*   **Key Challenge 2 (Handling Non-Deterministic Outputs):** While our initial focus is on deterministic errors, the capture of intermediate states can be a first step. For non-deterministic code, if multiple runs for the *same* generated code yield different outcomes (one error, one success), this creates a strong signal. The framework can be extended to analyze statistical properties of outputs from non-deterministic code if ground truth distributions are known for certain tasks, though this is a more advanced research direction. Primarily, we focus on consistent, reproducible error conditions.
*   **Key Challenge 4 (Scalability of Feedback Mechanisms):** We will investigate trace summarization techniques and prioritize feedback from the most informative parts of the trace (e.g., stack trace context around an error) to ensure the feedback signal to the LLM is not overwhelmingly verbose or noisy.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

This research is anticipated to yield several significant outcomes and contribute substantially to the field of deep learning for code.

**Expected Outcomes:**

1.  **A Novel, Effective Alignment Framework (IETA):** We expect to develop and validate IETA as a robust framework for fine-tuning Code LLMs using detailed execution-trace feedback. This framework will include documented processes for trace capture, feedback formulation, and model training.
2.  **More Robust and Reliable Code LLMs:** The primary outcome will be Code LLMs that exhibit significantly improved performance in generating robust and executable code. We anticipate:
    *   A measurable increase in pass@k scores on standard benchmarks compared to baselines.
    *   A substantial reduction in the frequency of runtime errors (e.g., `TypeError`, `IndexError`, `NullPointerException`) in generated code.
    *   Models that are better at handling edge cases or constraints implicitly defined by execution dynamics.
3.  **Demonstrable Learning of "Execution Sense":** We hypothesize that models trained with IETA will demonstrate an ability to "anticipate" common runtime issues. For example, they might learn to insert necessary null checks, boundary condition handling, or type coercions proactively, even if not explicitly stated in the prompt, because similar patterns led to negative feedback (errors) during IETA training.
4.  **Insights into LLM Debugging and Refinement:** The research will provide valuable insights into how Code LLMs learn from execution feedback, what types of trace information are most beneficial, and the comparative effectiveness of DPO versus RLAIF in this context. This contributes to a deeper understanding of post-training alignment.
5.  **Openly Accessible Research Artifacts:** We commit to open science principles. Subject to licensing and computational feasibility, we plan to release:
    *   The source code for the IETA framework.
    *   Scripts for execution and evaluation.
    *   Potentially, aggregated and anonymized execution trace datasets or new benchmark variants focused on runtime robustness.
    *   Fine-tuned model weights for smaller, open-source base models, if feasible.

**Impact:**

The broader impact of this research extends across academic and practical domains:

*   **Enhanced Developer Productivity and Experience:** By generating code that is less prone to runtime errors, IETA-aligned models can significantly reduce the frustrating and time-consuming cycle of debugging and fixing AI-generated code. This allows developers to leverage Code LLMs more effectively as reliable assistants, accelerating development and innovation.
*   **Improved Software Quality and Reliability:** As AI plays an increasing role in code generation, ensuring the reliability of that code is paramount. This research contributes directly to improving the trustworthiness of AI-generated software components, potentially leading to fewer bugs in production systems.
*   **Advancements in AI Alignment and Safety:** The methodology of learning from detailed, consequential feedback from a "world model" (in this case, the code execution environment) has broader implications for AI alignment. It provides a concrete example of how AI systems can be trained to better understand and interact with complex environments where their actions have tangible outcomes.
*   **New Directions for Code LLM Research:** This work will likely spur further research into leveraging diverse forms of dynamic program analysis and runtime information for Code LLM training and evaluation. It may also inspire new benchmark designs that specifically target runtime robustness and debugging capabilities.
*   **Contribution to the DL4C Community:** The research aligns perfectly with the themes of the DL4C workshop, particularly "Post-training and Alignment for Code," "Benchmarking and Evaluation for Code," and "Developer Productivity." The findings and open artifacts will be a valuable contribution to this research community.

In conclusion, the IETA project aims to make a substantial step towards Code LLMs that not only write code fluently but also write code that *works* reliably. By teaching models from the consequences of their generated code's execution, we expect to foster a new level of robustness in AI-assisted software development, ultimately making these powerful tools more practical and dependable for real-world applications.
