**1. Title: Syntactic and Semantic Conformance Steering for LLM Code Generation: Towards Correctness-by-Construction**

**2. Introduction**

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly transformed the landscape of automated code generation. Models like GPT-4, CodeLlama, and StarCoder demonstrate impressive capabilities in producing code across various programming languages and for diverse tasks (Chen et al., 2021). However, a persistent challenge is the propensity of these models to generate code that, while often plausible, suffers from syntactic inaccuracies or subtle semantic flaws (Noy & Zhang, 2023). This is particularly pronounced for complex programming tasks, low-resource languages where training data is scarce, or when specific semantic constraints must be met. The consequence is often a need for extensive post-hoc validation, debugging, and correction, which diminishes productivity gains and limits the safe deployment of LLMs in domains requiring high reliability, such as safety-critical systems or secure software development (AutoSafeCoder, Nunez et al., 2024).

The VerifAI workshop highlights the critical need to bridge the gap between the probabilistic nature of generative AI and the correctness-focused principles of formal verification. Current research explores various avenues, including using LLMs to aid formal proof generation (First et al., 2023), employing formal methods to validate or repair LLM outputs (Murphy et al., 2024), and developing multi-agent frameworks for iterative refinement (Nunez et al., 2024). While these approaches offer valuable improvements, many operate retrospectively on fully generated code. There is a compelling need for proactive mechanisms that guide the LLM *during* the generation process to ensure correctness from the outset, improving "first-shot" accuracy. This aligns with the workshop's special theme on enhancing LLM-driven code generation using techniques from programming languages and formal methods.

This research proposes **Syntactic and Semantic Conformance Steering (SSCSteer)**, a novel multi-stage mechanism integrated directly into the LLM's decoding process. SSCSteer aims to proactively guide code generation towards syntactic validity and semantic soundness. It achieves this through two primary components: (1) a lightweight, grammar-aware syntactic steerer that dynamically constrains token selection to adhere to the target language's context-free grammar (CFG), and (2) an incremental semantic checker that evaluates partial code snippets against pre-defined formal specifications or common bug patterns using simplified static analysis and, where appropriate, an SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver interface. By identifying and penalizing potential issues *as code is being generated*, SSCSteer endeavors to produce code that is more frequently correct-by-construction.

**Research Objectives:**
The primary objective of this research is to design, implement, and rigorously evaluate the SSCSteer framework to enhance the syntactic and semantic correctness of code generated by LLMs.
Specific objectives include:
1.  To develop a computationally efficient syntactic steering module that leverages target language CFGs to restrict LLM token generation to syntactically valid choices.
2.  To design and implement an incremental semantic steering module capable of identifying potential semantic flaws in partially generated code snippets using lightweight static analysis and targeted SMT queries.
3.  To integrate these steering modules into the LLM decoding process (e.g., beam search, nucleus sampling) to dynamically influence token probabilities and guide generation paths.
4.  To empirically evaluate the effectiveness of SSCSteer in improving code correctness (syntactic and semantic pass rates), reducing common bug patterns, and its performance on both general-purpose and low-resource programming languages.
5.  To analyze the trade-offs introduced by SSCSteer, including generation latency, computational overhead, and the balance between correctness and generative flexibility.

**Significance:**
This research holds significant potential for both scientific advancement and practical application. Scientifically, it contributes to the VerifAI workshop's core theme by demonstrating a novel approach to synergizing generative AI with formal methods, specifically embedding formal guidance within the generative loop. It addresses key challenges in the field, such as mitigating syntactic/semantic errors in LLM outputs (Challenge 1 from literature), fostering deeper integration of formal methods with LLMs (Challenge 2), and offering a scalable approach to verification through incremental, lightweight checks (partially addressing Challenge 3). Practically, SSCSteer aims to improve developer productivity by reducing the debugging burden associated with LLM-generated code. By enhancing the reliability of generated code, it can foster greater trust and broaden the applicability of LLMs in areas where correctness is paramount, including generating foundational code for low-resource programming languages (Challenge 4) and improving compliance with desired functional and non-functional properties (partially addressing Challenge 5).

**3. Methodology**

This research will be conducted in three main phases: (1) Component Design and Development, (2) System Integration, and (3) Experimental Evaluation. We will leverage existing pre-trained LLMs for code generation (e.g., CodeLlama, StarCoder) and focus on augmenting their decoding process rather than extensive re-training, although fine-tuning for responsiveness to steering feedback could be an avenue for future work.

**Phase 1: Component Design and Development**

*   **Syntactic Steering Module (SSM):**
    *   **Grammar Parsing:** For each target programming language, its context-free grammar (CFG) will be utilized. We will employ or develop a lightweight, incremental parser (e.g., based on Earley parsing principles or LALR lookahead) that can efficiently determine the set of syntactically valid next tokens given a partial code string.
    *   **Token Masking:** At each token generation step $i$, given the partially generated code $C_{i-1} = t_1 t_2 ... t_{i-1}$ and the language grammar $G$, the parser will identify the set of valid next tokens $V_i \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ (where $\mathcal{T}$ is the LLM's vocabulary). Tokens $t \notin V_i$ will be masked out (i.e., their probability set to zero or heavily penalized) from the LLM's output probability distribution.
        Let $P_{LLM}(t_k | C_{i-1})$ be the original probability assigned by the LLM to token $t_k$. The syntactically steered probability $P_{SSM}(t_k | C_{i-1})$ will be:
        $$ P_{SSM}(t_k | C_{i-1}) = \begin{cases} \frac{P_{LLM}(t_k | C_{i-1})}{\sum_{t_j \in V_i} P_{LLM}(t_j | C_{i-1})} & \text{if } t_k \in V_i \\ 0 & \text{if } t_k \notin V_i \end{cases} $$
    *   This ensures that only syntactically permissible tokens are considered for selection.

*   **Semantic Steering Module (SeSM):**
    *   **Triggering Conditions:** Semantic checks will be triggered incrementally at meaningful code boundaries (e.g., end of a statement, block, function definition, or upon generation of specific keywords indicating semantically critical operations).
    *   **Lightweight Static Analysis:** This sub-module will implement fast, targeted checks for common semantic errors or violations of good coding practices. Examples include:
        *   Type consistency checks for variable assignments and function calls (based on available type information or simple inference).
        *   Checks for uninitialized variables before use.
        *   Detection of common null-pointer dereference patterns.
        *   Simple array bounds checks where indices and array sizes are manifest.
        *   Adherence to basic API usage protocols.
    *   **SMT-based Validation:** For particularly critical code sections or when explicit formal specifications (e.g., pre/post-conditions, invariants provided as part of the prompt or task) are available, the SeSM will interface with an SMT solver (e.g., Z3, CVC5).
        *   Partial code snippets, along with relevant contextual information (variable types, existing assertions) and the target specification $\phi$, will be translated into an SMT query.
        *   For example, to check if a safety property $P$ holds for a generated snippet $S$, we query the SMT solver for the satisfiability of $\neg P \land \text{Semantics}(S)$. If unsatisfiable, $P$ holds. If satisfiable, a counterexample may be found, indicating a potential semantic flaw.
        *   To manage complexity, SMT checks will be localized and potentially bounded (e.g., bounded model checking for loops).
    *   **Feedback Mechanism:** If a potential semantic issue is detected by either static analysis or SMT validation, the SeSM will generate a penalty score for the current generation path. This score will be used to modulate the LLM's token probabilities, discouraging completion of the problematic path. The penalty $w_{sem} \in [0, 1]$ could be a function of the severity or confidence of the detected issue. The probability of a sequence $C_i$ would be adjusted:
        $$ P_{SeSM}(C_i) = P(C_i) \cdot w_{sem}(C_i) $$
        Alternatively, for advanced LLMs, a natural language feedback prompt could be constructed ("Warning: Variable `x` might be null here. Consider adding a check.") to elicit self-correction, though our primary focus will be on path penalization within beam search or probability adjustment for sampling.

**Phase 2: System Integration (SSCSteer Framework)**

The SSM and SeSM will be integrated into the LLM's decoding loop.
*   **Decoding Strategy:** We will primarily focus on augmenting beam search decoding.
    *   At each step of beam search, candidate next tokens for each beam are first filtered by the SSM.
    *   Beams leading to syntactically invalid states are pruned.
    *   Periodically, or when beams complete certain semantic units, the SeSM is invoked on the partial code represented by active beams.
    *   Beam scores will be adjusted based on the semantic penalties:
        $$ \text{score}(B_j) = \text{original\_score}(B_j) + \log(w_{sem}(B_j)) $$
        This re-ranks beams, prioritizing those that are semantically sounder.
*   For sampling-based decoding (e.g., nucleus sampling), the combined steering can modify the probability distribution before sampling:
    $$ P_{SSCSteer}(t_k | C_{i-1}) \propto P_{LLM}(t_k | C_{i-1}) \cdot M_{syn}(t_k) \cdot M_{sem}(C_{i-1} \oplus t_k) $$
    where $M_{syn}(t_k)$ is 1 if $t_k$ is syntactically valid and 0 otherwise (or a soft penalty), and $M_{sem}(C_{i-1} \oplus t_k)$ is the semantic score/multiplier if token $t_k$ completes a checkable unit. The specific formulation of $M_{sem}$ will be critical and explored during development.

**Phase 3: Experimental Evaluation**

*   **Datasets and Benchmarks:**
    *   **General Code Generation:** Standard benchmarks like HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Mostly Basic Python Problems) (Austin et al., 2021) for Python. Analogous benchmarks for other languages like Java (e.g., APPS benchmark problems adapted for Java).
    *   **Low-Resource Languages:** We will select 1-2 low-resource languages (e.g., Raku, Nim, or a domain-specific language where a CFG is available). Evaluation tasks might involve translating problems from existing benchmarks or creating a small, curated set of tasks relevant to the language's idioms. This may involve adapting existing benchmarks like MultiPL-E.
    *   **Semantically Constrained Tasks:** We will design tasks where specific semantic properties must hold (e.g., "generate a sorting function that correctly handles empty lists and lists with duplicates, and ensures no out-of-bounds access"). These tasks may come with simple formal specifications (e.g., JML-like annotations for Java, or Python assertions).
    *   **Bug Detection/Avoidance:** Tasks focused on generating code that avoids common pitfalls (e.g., from CWE database, or patterns identifiable by linters/static analyzers).
*   **Baseline Models:**
    1.  Base LLM (e.g., CodeLlama-Instruct 13B/34B) without any steering (vanilla generation).
    2.  Base LLM with post-hoc filtering using a standard parser (to isolate syntactic improvement from semantic steering).
    3.  If available, state-of-the-art methods that perform post-hoc repair or use simpler forms of guidance.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Syntactic Correctness:**
        *   Percentage of generated programs that parse successfully according to the target language's grammar.
    *   **Semantic Correctness & Functionality:**
        *   **Pass@k:** Percentage of problems for which at least one of $k$ generated solutions passes all unit tests.
        *   **Specification Adherence:** For tasks with explicit formal specs, percentage of generated programs satisfying these specs (verified by external tools or the SeSM's SMT component if robust enough).
        *   **Bug Density:** Number of bugs detected by standard static analysis tools (e.g., SonarLint, SpotBugs for Java; Pylint, Flake8 for Python) per KLOC in generated code, compared to baselines.
        *   **Reduction in Specific Bug Patterns:** Measure the occurrence rate of targeted bug patterns our SeSM aims to prevent.
    *   **Generation Efficiency & Overhead:**
        *   Average generation time per task/solution.
        *   Number of LLM inference calls / tokens processed per solution.
        *   Computational overhead of SSM and SeSM (parser time, SMT solver time).
    *   **Code Quality (Secondary):**
        *   CodeBLEU, ROUGE-L for similarity to reference solutions (where available), though correctness is prioritized.
        *   Qualitative human assessment on a subset of generated code for readability and maintainability.
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    1.  SSCSteer (Full System) vs. Base LLM.
    2.  SSM-only vs. Base LLM (to quantify syntactic improvement).
    3.  SeSM-only (applied post-hoc or with a naive syntactic layer) vs. Base LLM (to quantify semantic improvement, challenging to isolate perfectly).
    4.  Impact of different SeSM configurations (e.g., static analysis only vs. static analysis + SMT).
    5.  Performance across different LLM sizes and families if resources permit.

**Target Languages:**
The primary language for initial development and evaluation will be Python due to the rich ecosystem of tools and benchmarks. Subsequently, we will target Java (a statically-typed language where semantic checks are often more explicit) and one low-resource language to demonstrate broader applicability.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**Expected Outcomes:**
1.  **A Novel SSCSteer Framework:** A fully implemented and documented framework incorporating syntactic and semantic steering into LLM decoding for code generation. This includes the lightweight parser, incremental static analyzer, and SMT interface.
2.  **Empirical Validation of Improved Correctness:** Quantitative results demonstrating that SSCSteer significantly increases the percentage of syntactically correct code generated by LLMs (e.g., aiming for >95-99% parsability where grammar coverage is good).
3.  **Enhanced Semantic Soundness:** Evidence showing a statistically significant improvement in functional correctness (Pass@k) and a reduction in specific semantic bugs (e.g., null dereferences, type errors, violations of specified invariants) compared to unsteered LLMs and post-hoc methods. For instance, we anticipate a measurable increase in Pass@1 scores and a reduction in critical warnings from static analyzers by 20-40% depending on task complexity.
4.  **Performance Characterization:** A detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by SSCSteer, establishing practical limits and trade-offs between steering rigor and generation speed. We aim for the overhead to be acceptable for interactive use or slightly longer batch generation, e.g., within 2-5x of unsteered generation time for moderate checks.
5.  **Applicability to Low-Resource Languages:** Demonstration of SSCSteer's utility in improving code generation quality for at least one low-resource programming language, showcasing its potential where specialized tooling is scarce.
6.  **Open-Source Contribution:** We plan to release the core components of SSCSteer as an open-source library to facilitate further research and adoption.
7.  **Guidelines and Best Practices:** Insights into designing effective steering mechanisms, including how to balance strong guidance with maintaining generative diversity and how to efficiently integrate formal checks into the LLM loop.

**Impact:**
*   **Scientific Impact:**
    *   This research will advance the state-of-the-art in generating reliable code using LLMs by pioneering a "correctness-by-construction" approach within the decoding process.
    *   It will offer a concrete methodology for integrating formal methods (grammars, static analysis, SMT) deeply into generative AI, directly addressing a central theme of the VerifAI workshop.
    *   The findings will contribute to a better understanding of how to control and guide LLM outputs for complex, structured tasks like code generation, potentially inspiring similar steering mechanisms for other generative domains.
    *   It will address recognized challenges in the field, including the prevalence of errors in LLM-generated code, the difficulty of integrating formal methods, the scalability of verification, and the specific needs of low-resource languages.

*   **Practical Impact:**
    *   **Increased Developer Productivity:** By significantly improving the "first-shot" correctness of LLM-generated code, SSCSteer can drastically reduce the time developers spend debugging and correcting AI suggestions, thereby accelerating software development cycles.
    *   **Enhanced Trust and Reliability:** More reliable code generation will foster greater trust in LLM-based coding assistants and tools, paving the way for their adoption in more critical software components and workflows.
    *   **Improved Code Quality and Security:** The semantic steering component, by targeting common bug patterns and allowing for specification adherence, can lead to higher-quality and potentially more secure code. While not a full security solution, it can mitigate certain classes of vulnerabilities.
    *   **Broader Accessibility for Low-Resource Languages:** By making LLMs more effective for languages with limited tooling or large-scale training corpora, SSCSteer can help democratize advanced code generation capabilities.
    *   **Foundation for Advanced AI Verifiers:** This work could serve as a stepping stone towards developing more sophisticated AI systems that not only generate code but also provide strong, formally-backed assurances about its properties, aligning with the "AI as verifiers" theme of the VerifAI workshop.

By proactively steering LLMs towards syntactic and semantic conformance, this research aims to make a substantial contribution to making AI-generated code more reliable, trustworthy, and ultimately, more useful in practice.
