**Title:** Syntactic and Semantic Conformance Steering for LLM Code Generation

**Motivation:** LLMs frequently generate code that is syntactically incorrect or semantically flawed, especially for complex tasks or low-resource languages. This necessitates costly post-hoc correction, hindering productivity. This research aims to enhance the "first-shot" correctness of LLM-generated code.

**Main Idea:** We propose a multi-stage steering mechanism embedded within the LLM's decoding process for code generation. First, a lightweight parser, guided by the target language's context-free grammar, dynamically constrains token selection to ensure syntactic validity. Second, for semantically critical sections, partial code snippets are incrementally checked against pre-defined formal specifications or common bug patterns using a simplified static analyzer or an SMT solver interface. If potential issues are identified, the generation path is penalized, or the LLM is prompted to re-evaluate its choices. This "generate-and-validate-incrementally" approach aims to produce code that is more often correct-by-construction, reducing debugging effort and boosting reliability, particularly for safety-critical applications or low-resource programming languages.
