**1. Title:** RAG-Informed Dynamic Data Valuation for Fair Marketplaces

**2. Introduction**

Foundation Models (FMs) have emerged as a transformative technology in machine learning, powering a wide array of applications from natural language understanding to multimodal synthesis (Bommasani et al., 2021). The performance and capabilities of these models are inextricably linked to the vast quantities of data they are trained on. Consequently, there is a burgeoning focus on data-related challenges, including meticulous curation, efficient attribution, and the fair valuation of data contributions (DATA-FM Workshop Overview). As FMs become increasingly integrated into complex systems like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020), the traditional paradigms for data handling and valuation are proving inadequate, primarily due to the immense scale of data and model architectures.

The advent of data marketplaces aims to facilitate the exchange of data, yet they often struggle with mechanisms for fairly and accurately compensating data contributors. Current static pricing models, typically based on volume or broad categorical assessments, fail to capture the dynamic and context-dependent utility of specific data chunks, especially within RAG systems. In RAG, the value of a particular piece of data emerges from its relevance to a specific query, its ability to inform the generative model, and its impact on the final output quality. This utility can fluctuate significantly based on an evolving corpus, changing user needs, and the model's learning. Such a dynamic value landscape, if not properly accounted for, can disincentivize the contribution of high-quality, niche, or contextually critical data.

This research proposes a paradigm shift towards **RAG-Informed Dynamic Data Valuation**. The central idea is to create a framework where the economic value of data contributions is continuously and automatically updated. This valuation will be directly informed by their attributed impact within RAG systems, specifically quantifying how individual data chunks contribute to the quality, relevance, and success of RAG-generated outputs.

**Research Objectives:**

The primary objectives of this research are:
1.  To develop **lightweight and efficient attribution techniques** capable of tracing RAG system outputs back to the specific retrieved data chunks responsible for their generation, suitable for real-time or near real-time application.
2.  To design and implement a method for **quantifying the contribution** of these attributed data chunks to measurable aspects of RAG output quality (e.g., accuracy, relevance, helpfulness) and task success.
3.  To construct a **dynamic pricing mechanism** that integrates these contribution scores, retrieval frequency, user feedback on RAG outputs, and potentially other market signals to update data chunk valuations continuously.
4.  To evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated data marketplace, assessing its ability to foster **fairer compensation** for data contributors and incentivize the provision of high-value data.
5.  To lay the groundwork for a more **transparent and equitable data economy** for FMs, addressing critical challenges highlighted in the DATA-FM workshop concerning data marketplaces and economic models for data pricing.

**Significance:**

This research holds significant promise for advancing both the technical underpinnings of data-centric AI and the socio-economic structures surrounding data exchange. By accurately reflecting the contextual and dynamic utility of data within powerful FM applications like RAG, this work can:
*   **Establish a new standard for data valuation:** Moving beyond simplistic, static models to a more nuanced, usage-based valuation.
*   **Incentivize high-quality data contributions:** Fairly rewarding providers whose data demonstrably improves FM performance will encourage the creation and sharing of valuable datasets, benefiting the entire FM ecosystem.
*   **Promote a more transparent data economy:** Clear attribution and value derivation can foster trust and participation in data marketplaces.
*   **Address critical workshop themes:** Directly contributes to discussions on "Data Attribution, Interpretability, and Data Marketplaces," "Economic models for data pricing," and indirectly supports "Legal and Technical Solutions for Data Copyright Protection" by ensuring contributors are recognized and valued for their input.
*   **Enhance FM capabilities:** By fostering a market for high-utility data, the overall quality and reliability of data available for RAG systems and FM fine-tuning could improve, leading to better-performing and more trustworthy AI.

The proposed research directly tackles the challenges of adapting data-centric methods to the scale of FMs by focusing on efficiency in attribution and valuation updates, crucial for practical deployment.

**3. Methodology**

This research will adopt a multi-faceted approach, encompassing algorithmic development, system design, and rigorous empirical evaluation within a simulated data marketplace environment.

**3.1. Research Design Overview**

The core of the methodology involves constructing a closed-loop system where (1) RAG systems process queries using a corpus of data chunks, (2) an attribution mechanism identifies the influence of specific chunks on the output, (3) a valuation module quantifies this influence into a contribution score, and (4) a dynamic pricing engine updates the market value of these chunks based on aggregated scores, retrieval frequency, and user feedback. These updated values, in turn, can influence future data provision and selection.

**3.2. Data Collection and Preparation**

To develop and evaluate the proposed framework, we will require:
1.  **Corpus Data:** Large-scale, diverse text corpora that serve as the knowledge base for the RAG system. Examples include subsets of Wikipedia, C4, arXiv papers, or domain-specific document collections. These will be segmented into manageable "data chunks" (e.g., paragraphs, document sections). Each chunk will be associated with a (simulated) contributor.
2.  **Query-Answer Datasets:** Standard question-answering datasets (e.g., Natural Questions, MS MARCO, SQuAD) or task-specific datasets (e.g., for summarization, dialogue generation) will be used to drive the RAG system and provide ground truth for evaluating output quality.
3.  **User Feedback Data (Simulated/Collected):** To model real-world interaction, we will initially simulate user feedback (e.g., ratings of answer relevance, accuracy, helpfulness). If feasible, a small-scale pilot with human evaluators could provide more nuanced feedback.

**3.3. Algorithmic Development**

The system will comprise three main algorithmic components: Lightweight RAG Attribution, Contribution Quantification, and Dynamic Pricing.

**3.3.1. Lightweight RAG Attribution Mechanism**

The goal is to efficiently determine the influence of each retrieved data chunk $d_k$ from a set of $M$ retrieved chunks $C = \{d_1, ..., d_M\}$ on the RAG system's final output $a$ generated in response to a query $q$.
Let $a = G(q, R(q))$, where $R(q) = C$ is the set of chunks retrieved by the retriever and $G$ is the generator. We aim to compute an attribution score $A(d_k | q, C, a)$ for each $d_k \in C$.

*   **Approaches to Explore:**
    1.  **Attention-based Attribution:** For transformer-based RAG models, the cross-attention weights between the generated output tokens and the input tokens from retrieved chunks can serve as a proxy for influence. We will investigate methods to aggregate these attention scores (e.g., sum, max, or learned aggregation) per chunk. Inspired by Ding et al. (2024), who augment attention with dependency parsing for semantic completeness, we may explore simplified semantic cues if computationally viable.
    2.  **Perturbation-based Attribution:** Inspired by SCARLet (Xu et al., 2025) and counterfactual attribution (Saha Roy et al., 2024), we will explore lightweight perturbation techniques. This might involve:
        *   Removing a chunk $d_k$ from $C$ and observing the change in output quality or specific output features: $\Delta Q(a | C \setminus \{d_k\})$.
        *   Replacing $d_k$ with a neutral or random chunk.
        To maintain "lightweight" status, full re-generation might be too slow. Instead, we could approximate the impact using gradient-based methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients, SHAP if adaptable) on the generator's output probabilities or internal representations.
    3.  **Simplified Influence Functions:** Estimate the influence of $d_k$ on $a$ by approximating how the model's parameters would change if $d_k$ were up-weighted or down-weighted during a hypothetical fine-tuning step related to the current query-answer pair.

*   **Mathematical Formulation (Conceptual):**
    The attribution $A(d_k | q, C, a)$ could be defined, for instance, via a normalized score:
    $$ A(d_k | q, C, a) = \frac{\text{raw_influence}(d_k, q, C, a)}{\sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{raw_influence}(d_j, q, C, a) + \epsilon} $$
    where $\text{raw_influence}$ is derived from attention, perturbation, or gradient measures. The focus will be on methods that avoid full retraining or extensive sampling, aligning with the efficiency goals of NDDV (Liang et al., 2024).

**3.3.2. Contribution Quantification**

Once an attribution score $A(d_k | q, C, a)$ is obtained, it needs to be combined with a measure of the output's quality or utility.
*   **Output Quality Metrics ($Q(a)$):**
    *   **Task-specific metrics:** ROUGE, BLEU for summarization/translation; F1, Exact Match for QA.
    *   **Semantic similarity:** Cosine similarity between the generated answer $a$ and a reference answer (if available), or between $a$ and the query $q$ mediated by $d_k$.
    *   **User Feedback Scores ($U(a)$):** Numerical ratings (e.g., 1-5 stars) or binary feedback (helpful/unhelpful).
*   **Contribution Score ($CS$):**
    The contribution score of a chunk $d_k$ for a specific interaction $(q, a)$ can be defined as:
    $$ CS(d_k, q, a) = A(d_k | q, C, a) \times w_Q \cdot Q(a) + w_U \cdot U(a) $$
    where $w_Q$ and $w_U$ are weights balancing automated quality metrics and user feedback.

**3.3.3. Dynamic Data Valuation and Pricing Mechanism**

The core of the marketplace fairness lies in this component. The price $P(d_i, t)$ of a data chunk $d_i$ at time $t$ will be dynamically updated.

*   **Aggregated Value Score ($V(d_i, t)$):** This score represents the cumulative utility of data chunk $d_i$ up to time $t$.
    $$ V(d_i, t) = \sum_{(q,a) \text{ involving } d_i \text{ up to } t} CS(d_i, q, a) \cdot e^{-\lambda (t - t_{qa})} $$
    where $t_{qa}$ is the timestamp of the interaction $(q,a)$, and $\lambda$ is a decay factor, prioritizing recent contributions or accounting for data staleness.
*   **Retrieval Frequency ($RF(d_i, t)$):** The number of times $d_i$ has been retrieved up to time $t$.
*   **Aggregated User Feedback ($AUF(d_i, t)$):** An aggregated score of user feedback for all outputs $a$ generated using $d_i$.

*   **Pricing Function:**
    The price $P(d_i, t)$ can be modeled as:
    $$ P(d_i, t) = f(V(d_i, t), RF(d_i, t), AUF(d_i, t), H(d_i, t), M_s(t)) $$
    where:
    *   $H(d_i, t)$ represents historical performance factors (e.g., variance in contribution scores).
    *   $M_s(t)$ represents market signals (e.g., overall demand for data, supply of similar data).
    A simpler initial model could be a weighted linear combination:
    $$ P(d_i, t) = \omega_V V(d_i, t) + \omega_{RF} \log(RF(d_i, t) + 1) + \omega_{AUF} AUF(d_i, t) + P_{base} $$
    The weights $\omega_V, \omega_{RF}, \omega_{AUF}$ can be learned or set based on policy. $P_{base}$ is a base price for listing/contribution.
*   **Update Efficiency:** Updates to $P(d_i, t)$ should be efficient. Instead of recomputing from scratch, incremental updates will be used. The NDDV framework's optimal control perspective for efficient value estimation without retraining utility functions will be a key inspiration here. We aim to estimate the sensitivity of the overall market "health" or RAG performance to individual data chunks.

**3.4. Experimental Design and Validation**

A simulated data marketplace will be developed to test the proposed framework.

*   **Simulated Environment:**
    *   **Data Providers:** Agents who contribute data chunks of varying (pre-defined or stochastic) quality. Their goal is to maximize rewards.
    *   **RAG System Users:** Agents who issue queries to the RAG system.
    *   **Marketplace Operator:** Manages data ingestion, valuation updates, and transactions.
*   **RAG Setup:**
    *   **Retriever:** Standard dense retriever (e.g., DPR) or sparse retriever (e.g., BM25).
    *   **Generator:** Pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model (e.g., BART, T5) adapted for RAG.
*   **Baselines for Comparison:**
    1.  **Static Pricing:** Price per chunk, price per token/word count.
    2.  **Popularity-based Pricing:** Price based solely on retrieval frequency.
    3.  **Traditional Data Valuation (scaled down):** Data Shapley or Leave-One-Out (LOO) if computationally feasible on a subset for fairness benchmarking, acknowledging their typical high cost.
    4.  Ablation studies: Evaluate impact of different components (attribution, user feedback weighting).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Attribution Quality:**
        *   **Faithfulness:** Measure the drop in RAG output quality (e.g., ROUGE score) when a highly attributed chunk is removed versus a lowly attributed one.
        *   **Plausibility (Qualitative):** Human evaluation on a subset of query-answer-chunk triplets to assess if the attribution makes sense.
        *   **Computational Cost:** Latency of attribution per query.
    2.  **Marketplace Fairness & Effectiveness:**
        *   **Correlation of Price and Utility:** Correlation between the dynamic price of a data chunk and its actual contribution to RAG performance (e.g., average improvement in $Q(a)$ when the chunk is used). This requires a method to estimate "true" utility, possibly using oracle experiments with synthetic data where chunk values are predefined.
        *   **Incentive Compatibility:** Simulate data providers adapting their strategy (e.g., providing higher quality data). Does the market reward high-quality contributors more effectively over time?
        *   **Gini Coefficient of Payouts:** To understand the distribution of rewards (though lower isn't always better without context of quality distribution).
        *   **Convergence and Stability:** Do prices stabilize, or do they oscillate excessively?
    3.  **RAG System Performance:** Does the RAG system, when prioritizing data selection based on the dynamic valuation (e.g., in a scenario where data access has costs), perform better on downstream tasks?
    4.  **Scalability and Efficiency:**
        *   Throughput of price updates per unit time.
        *   Latency for query processing, including attribution and value update.
        *   Ability to handle a growing number of data chunks and transactions.

**3.5. Addressing Privacy Concerns**

While the primary focus is on valuation, the design of attribution mechanisms will be mindful of not unnecessarily exposing sensitive information from the underlying data chunks. If attribution scores themselves are considered sensitive, techniques for privacy-preserving aggregation or differential privacy in reporting value could be explored as future extensions. The current scope assumes data shared in the marketplace is intended for use in RAG, but attribution should not create new privacy vulnerabilities.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

This research is poised to deliver several significant outcomes and generate substantial impact across scientific, economic, and societal domains.

**Expected Outcomes:**

1.  **A Novel Dynamic Data Valuation Framework:** The primary outcome will be a fully developed and empirically tested framework for RAG-informed dynamic data valuation. This includes the algorithms, software prototype of the simulated marketplace, and detailed performance characteristics.
