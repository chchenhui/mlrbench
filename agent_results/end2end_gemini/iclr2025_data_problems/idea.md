**Title:** RAG-Informed Dynamic Data Valuation for Fair Marketplaces

**Motivation:** Current data marketplaces struggle to fairly compensate data contributors for Foundation Models, especially as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) makes the utility of specific data chunks highly dynamic and context-dependent. A static pricing model fails to capture this evolving value, potentially disincentivizing high-quality contributions.

**Main Idea:** We propose a dynamic data valuation framework where prices for data contributions are continuously updated based on their attributed impact within RAG systems. The methodology involves developing lightweight attribution techniques to trace RAG outputs back to specific retrieved data chunks and quantify their contribution to answer quality or task success. These contribution scores, combined with retrieval frequency and user feedback on RAG outputs, will drive a real-time pricing mechanism. Expected outcomes include a more equitable marketplace that accurately reflects data utility, incentivizes the provision of high-value data for diverse FM applications, and fosters a transparent data economy. This could establish a new standard for valuing data in the FM era.
