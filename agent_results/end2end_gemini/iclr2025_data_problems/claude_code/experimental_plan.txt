# Experimental Plan for RAG-Informed Dynamic Data Valuation

## Overview
This experiment aims to evaluate the proposed RAG-Informed Dynamic Data Valuation framework for fair data marketplaces. We will simulate a data marketplace where contributors provide data chunks that are used in a RAG system, and evaluate how different data valuation methods affect fairness, data quality incentives, and overall RAG system performance.

## Key Components

1. **RAG System**
   - Retriever: BM25 and Dense Passage Retriever (DPR)
   - Generator: Pre-trained language model with fine-tuning capability (e.g., T5-base)

2. **Attribution Mechanisms**
   - Attention-based attribution
   - Perturbation-based attribution (leave-one-out)
   - Combined attribution approach

3. **Data Valuation Methods**
   - Proposed dynamic valuation (our method)
   - Static pricing (baseline 1)
   - Popularity-based pricing (baseline 2)
   - Data Shapley (baseline 3, for a small subset due to computational constraints)

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Attribution quality:
     * Faithfulness (measured by output quality drop when removing chunks)
     * Computational efficiency (latency)
   - Market fairness:
     * Correlation between price and utility
     * Gini coefficient of rewards
     * Market dynamics (price stability over time)
   - RAG system performance:
     * Task-specific metrics (e.g., F1, ROUGE)
     * User satisfaction (simulated)

## Experimental Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Select a suitable corpus (e.g., subset of Wikipedia)
   - Segment into data chunks
   - Assign quality labels to chunks (for evaluation purposes)
   - Prepare query-answer pairs for RAG evaluation

2. **Simulation Setup**
   - Create simulated data providers with varying data quality profiles
   - Create simulated users who issue queries and provide feedback
   - Configure marketplace parameters (transaction costs, base prices, etc.)

3. **Experimental Runs**
   - For each valuation method (proposed + baselines):
     * Initialize the marketplace
     * Run RAG queries with attribution tracking
     * Update data valuations based on method-specific formulas
     * Simulate marketplace dynamics (providers responding to incentives)
     * Measure all evaluation metrics
     * Repeat for multiple iterations to observe trends

4. **Analysis**
   - Compare methods across all evaluation metrics
   - Analyze how incentives affect data quality over time
   - Identify strengths and weaknesses of each approach
   - Generate visualizations and tables for results

## Specific Experiments

1. **Attribution Mechanism Evaluation**
   - Compare attribution methods for faithfulness and efficiency
   - Select the best mechanism for further experiments

2. **Market Dynamics Simulation**
   - Long-running simulation to observe how different valuation methods affect:
     * Data quality evolution
     * Provider behavior
     * Price stability

3. **RAG Performance Impact**
   - Evaluate how different data valuation methods affect RAG system performance
   - Test hypothesis that dynamic valuation leads to better data selection

4. **Scalability Testing**
   - Measure performance with increasing dataset sizes
   - Analyze computational efficiency of different methods

5. **Robustness Testing**
   - Introduce noise in user feedback
   - Test sensitivity to parameter choices
   - Evaluate resilience to strategic provider behavior

## Implementation Plan

1. First implement core RAG system
2. Add attribution mechanisms
3. Implement valuation methods
4. Create simulation environment
5. Run experiments and collect results
6. Analyze results and generate visualizations
