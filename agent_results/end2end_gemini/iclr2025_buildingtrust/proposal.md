**1. Title: Concept-Graph Explanations for Unveiling Reasoning Chains in Large Language Models**

**2. Introduction**

The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into diverse applications, from customer service to complex decision support, has underscored both their transformative potential and inherent opaqueness. While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant text, the internal mechanisms driving their outputs, particularly for multi-step reasoning tasks, often remain a "black box." This lack of transparency poses significant challenges to establishing trust, ensuring safety, and verifying the reliability of LLM-generated information (Workshop on Building Trust in Language Models and Applications). Current explainability methods predominantly focus on token-level importance (e.g., saliency maps, attention scores), providing granular insights but often failing to capture the higher-level conceptual flow underlying an LLM's reasoning process (Zhao et al., 2023). Such methods are insufficient for dissecting complex inferential chains, making it difficult for users and developers to understand *how* an LLM arrives at a conclusion, verify its factual accuracy, or debug erroneous reasoning.

This research proposes a novel approach, "Concept-Graph Explanations," to address this critical gap. Our primary objective is to develop a methodology that extracts and visualizes an LLM's reasoning process as a structured graph of interconnected, human-understandable concepts. This involves: (1) systematically probing the LLM's internal activations and attention mechanisms during the generation of a response; (2) designing techniques to map these low-level internal states to meaningful, high-level concepts or intermediate reasoning steps relevant to the input query and the generated output; and (3) constructing a directed Concept-Graph where nodes represent these identified concepts and edges denote the inferential or sequential links between them, as derived from the LLM's internal dynamics.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to fundamentally enhance the transparency and interpretability of LLMs, particularly for tasks requiring logical deduction, factual recall, and multi-step problem-solving. By providing a conceptual overview of the LLM's "thought process," Concept-Graphs can empower users to scrutinize and validate model outputs, foster greater trust in LLM-driven applications, and facilitate more effective debugging by pinpointing specific points of failure or bias in the reasoning chain. This work directly aligns with the scope of the Workshop on Building Trust in Language Models and Applications, particularly concerning "Explainability and interpretability of language model responses" (Scope #3), "Improving reliability and truthfulness of LLMs" (Scope #2), and "Error detection and correction" (Scope #8). Addressing key challenges such as mapping internal states to human-understandable concepts and ensuring the faithfulness of explanations (Yeh et al., 2022; El Shawi, 2024) is central to this proposal. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to the development of more trustworthy, accountable, and human-centric AI systems.

**3. Methodology**

This research will be conducted in four interconnected phases: LLM internal state probing and feature extraction, concept identification and mapping, Concept-Graph construction, and a comprehensive experimental evaluation.

**Phase 1: LLM Internal State Probing and Feature Extraction**

The initial phase focuses on accessing and extracting relevant information from the internal workings of LLMs during the text generation process.

*   **LLM Selection:** We will primarily focus on publicly available, pre-trained transformer-based LLMs such as Llama 2/3 (7B or 13B parameters) or Mistral variants. These models offer a balance between strong performance and accessibility for in-depth analysis. Access to hidden states and attention weights via libraries like Hugging Face's `transformers` will be crucial.
*   **Probing Techniques:**
    *   **Hidden State Extraction:** We will extract hidden state representations $H^{(l)}_t$ from multiple layers $l$ (e.g., early, middle, and final layers) at each token generation step $t$. This allows us to capture information processed at different levels of abstraction.
    *   **Attention Weight Analysis:** Attention weights $\alpha_{t,i,j}^{(l,h)}$ from self-attention mechanisms (layer $l$, head $h$, query token $i$, key token $j$ at step $t$) will be collected. These weights indicate how different parts of the input and previously generated context influence the generation of the current token.
    *   **Dynamic Probing during Generation:** We will analyze how these internal states evolve as the LLM generates a response, particularly when prompted for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning (e.g., using Chain-of-Thought prompts to elicit explicit reasoning steps which can later be correlated with internal states).

**Phase 2: Concept Identification and Mapping**

This phase aims to bridge the gap between low-level neural activations and high-level, human-interpretable concepts. This is a core challenge identified in the literature (Yeh et al., 2022).

*   **Defining "Concepts":** For this research, a "concept" refers to a semantically meaningful unit of information, an intermediate reasoning step, an entity, a relation, or a premise that the LLM appears to be utilizing or generating as part of its overall reasoning chain. Concepts should be at a higher level of abstraction than individual tokens. For example, in solving a math word problem, concepts might include "identifying variables," "retrieving relevant formula," "performing addition," etc.
*   **Mapping Internal States to Concepts:** We will explore a hybrid approach:
    1.  **Semi-Supervised Concept Anchoring:**
        *   **Initial Concept Vocabulary:** For specific tasks (e.g., arithmetic reasoning, simple QA), we will pre-define a small set of expected intermediate concepts.
        *   **Linear Probes:** Train lightweight linear classifiers (probes) on the extracted hidden states $H^{(l)}_t$ to predict the presence or relevance of these predefined concepts at different stages of generation. The probe $P_\phi$ for a concept $c$ would be a function $P_\phi: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow [0,1]$ predicting the probability of concept $c$ given a hidden state, trained using limited annotated data where specific reasoning steps are labeled.
            $$ P_\phi(H^{(l)}_t) = \sigma(W_c H^{(l)}_t + b_c) $$
            where $W_c$ and $b_c$ are learnable parameters for concept $c$, and $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.
    2.  **Unsupervised Concept Discovery & Clustering:**
        *   Apply dimensionality reduction (e.g., UMAP, PCA) and clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN) to an aggregated set of hidden states that correspond to segments of generated text (e.g., sentences or phrases within a reasoning chain).
        *   These clusters may represent emergent, data-driven concepts.
        *   Techniques inspired by SEER (Chen et al., 2025) for aggregating similar concepts in representation space will be adapted, focusing on localizing concepts within specific generation steps.
    3.  **LLM-Aided Concept Labeling:** Use another LLM (e.g., GPT-4) in a few-shot prompting setup to help assign human-readable labels to the discovered unsupervised clusters or to refine the output of linear probes, drawing inspiration from Zeng (2024) but for concept identification rather than SHAP value verbalization. For instance, given the input query, the LLM's output, and a segment of activations, the helper LLM can be prompted to suggest a concept that these activations might represent in the context of the reasoning.
    *   **Concept Representation:** Each identified concept $C_k$ will be associated with the set of LLM internal states (or their aggregate representation) that led to its identification.

**Phase 3: Concept-Graph Construction**

Once concepts are identified and mapped, this phase will focus on structuring them into a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ representing the LLM's reasoning flow.

*   **Nodes ($V$):** Each node $v_k \in V$ will correspond to an identified concept $C_k$. Nodes will be ordered temporally based on their emergence during the LLM's generation process.
*   **Edges ($E$):** Directed edges $(v_i, v_j) \in E$ will represent an inferential or sequential link from concept $C_i$ to concept $C_j$. The derivation of these edges will consider:
    1.  **Temporal Succession:** An edge is primarily drawn if concept $C_j$ is identified at generation step $t_j$ subsequent to concept $C_i$ identified at $t_i$ ($t_j > t_i$).
    2.  **Attentional Linkage:** The strength or likelihood of an edge can be weighted by analyzing attention patterns. If hidden states corresponding to $C_j$ strongly attend to hidden states corresponding to $C_i$ (or the input tokens that triggered $C_i$), this suggests an influential link.
        Let $S_i$ be the set of token indices associated with concept $C_i$, and $S_j$ for $C_j$. The edge weight $w_{ij}$ could be a function of aggregated attention scores:
        $$ w_{ij} = f\left( \sum_{p \in S_j, q \in S_i} \text{AttentionScore}(token_p, token_q) \right) $$
    3.  **Information Flow Probes:** We may explore more sophisticated methods, such as training probes to predict information flow between concept-linked activation patterns, drawing parallels to causal tracing but at a conceptual level.
*   **Graph Attributes:** Edges can be weighted by confidence scores derived from the concept identification phase or the attentional linkage strength. Nodes can be annotated with the actual text segment from the LLM's output that corresponds to the concept.
*   **Visualization:** The resulting graph will be visualized using standard graph visualization libraries (e.g., NetworkX with Matplotlib, Gephi) to provide an intuitive representation of the reasoning chain.

**Phase 4: Experimental Design and Validation**

Rigorous evaluation is crucial to assess the utility and faithfulness of the generated Concept-Graphs.

*   **Tasks and Datasets:**
    *   **Multi-step Question Answering:** HotpotQA (requiring reasoning over multiple documents), StrategyQA (requiring implicit reasoning steps).
    *   **Mathematical Reasoning:** GSM8K (grade school math problems with step-by-step solutions). The step-by-step solutions can serve as a partial ground truth for comparing reasoning steps.
    *   **Logical Deduction:** Synthetic datasets with known logical structures (e.g., variants of bAbI tasks or CLUTRR for relational reasoning).
*   **Baselines for Comparison:**
    *   **Token-level attribution methods:** Integrated Gradients, LIME, SHAP (specifically TextGenSHAP (Enouen et al., 2023) where applicable for text generation).
    *   **Attention visualization:** Raw attention maps.
    *   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting outputs:** To compare the explicitness and structure provided by Concept-Graphs versus the raw text of CoT.
    *   **Decomposition-based methods:** Such as ALTI-Logit or LRP (Arras et al., 2025) applied to critical decision points.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Faithfulness:**
        *   **Perturbation Analysis (Inspired by "sufficiency" and "comprehensiveness"):** If a concept node deemed critical by the graph is "perturbed" in the input (e.g., by rephrasing the input to omit information leading to that concept, or by trying to guide the LLM away from it), does the LLM's output or subsequent reasoning path change in a way consistent with the graph's prediction?
        *   **Counterfactual Evaluation:** Generate an explanation for a correct answer. Then, induce an error in the LLM (e.g., via adversarial prompt or by providing misleading context) and see if the concept graph for the erroneous output highlights a plausible faulty reasoning step.
        *   **Correlation with Ground Truth Steps:** For datasets like GSM8K, quantify the alignment between the identified concepts in the graph and the human-annotated solution steps. This can be measured using metrics like BLEU score (if concepts are textual) or semantic similarity if concepts are embedded.
    2.  **Interpretability and Plausibility (Human Evaluation):**
        *   Present LLM queries, responses, and their corresponding Concept-Graphs to human evaluators (domain experts and non-experts).
        *   Collect ratings on:
            *   **Clarity:** Are the concepts and their connections easy to understand?
            *   **Coherence:** Does the graph present a logical and plausible reasoning flow?
            *   **Completeness:** Does the graph seem to capture the key steps in the LLM's reasoning?
            *   **Helpfulness:** How helpful is the graph in understanding why the LLM produced its specific output, especially for identifying errors or surprising conclusions?
        *   Tasks for users: (a) Given a query and an LLM response with a Concept-Graph, identify the most crucial reasoning step. (b) Given two Concept-Graphs for two different LLM responses to the same query, identify which response is more soundly reasoned (if applicable).
        *   We may leverage LLMs as evaluators for certain aspects to scale evaluation, following methodologies similar to Zhang et al. (2024), cross-validated with human judgments.
    3.  **Concept Quality:**
        *   **Concept Consistency:** Do similar input perturbations that should target the same underlying concept activate similar concept nodes in the graph?
        *   **Concept Distinctiveness:** Are different concepts in the graph semantically distinct and well-separated in the LLM's representation space?
    4.  **Computational Cost:** Measure the time and resources required to generate a Concept-Graph for a given query and response length. Scalability is a key concern addressed by TextGenSHAP (Enouen et al., 2023) for token-level, and we aim for reasonable efficiency for concept-level.
*   **User Studies:** Conduct targeted user studies where participants perform tasks (e.g., debugging LLM errors, assessing response trustworthiness) with and without access to Concept-Graph explanations. Measure task completion time, accuracy, and user-reported confidence and trust. This directly addresses the need for user-centric explanation design (Challenge #5 from Lit Review).

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

This research is poised to deliver several significant outcomes and have a substantial impact on the field of LLM trustworthiness and explainability.

**Expected Outcomes:**

1.  **A Novel Concept-Graph Methodology:** The primary outcome will be a fully developed and validated methodology for generating Concept-Graph explanations that trace the high-level reasoning chains of LLMs. This includes algorithms for concept identification from internal states and graph construction.

**Impact:**

*   **Academic Impact:**
    *   **Advancing XAI for LLMs:** This work will push the boundaries of LLM explainability beyond token-level attributions, offering a new paradigm for understanding complex reasoning processes. It directly addresses the challenges outlined by surveys like Zhao et al. (2023).
    *   **Fostering New Research Directions:** The Concept-Graph framework could inspire further research into higher-level abstractions in neural networks, symbolic-neural integration for explanations, and methods for actively guiding LLMs towards more interpretable reasoning.
*   **Practical Impact:**
    *   **Enhancing Trustworthiness and Reliability (Workshop Scope #1, #2, #3):** By making LLM reasoning transparent, Concept-Graphs can help users and developers assess the reliability and factual correctness of LLM outputs, fostering justified trust. If the graph reveals a flawed or biased reasoning path, it allows for critical evaluation rather than blind acceptance.
    *   **Facilitating Debugging and Error Correction (Workshop Scope #8):** Developers can use Concept-Graphs to diagnose *why* an LLM produced an incorrect or undesirable output, pinpointing specific conceptual errors or broken inferential links. This is crucial for model improvement.
    *   **Informing the Design of Guardrails and Safety Mechanisms (Workshop Scope #7):** Understanding common failure modes in reasoning, as revealed by Concept-Graphs, can inform the development of more effective guardrails to prevent harmful or nonsensical outputs. For example, if certain concepts are consistently part of problematic reasoning chains, they can be flagged.
    *   **Improving Human-AI Collaboration:** Transparent reasoning processes enable more effective collaboration, allowing humans to understand the AI's perspective, identify its limitations, and provide more targeted feedback.
    *   **Supporting Fairness Audits (Workshop Scope #6):** Concept-Graphs could potentially highlight if an LLM's reasoning relies on stereotypical or biased intermediate concepts, contributing to fairness assessments.
*   **Societal Impact:**
    *   Ultimately, by improving our ability to understand, scrutinize, and trust LLMs, this research aims to contribute to their safer and more ethical deployment in high-stakes domains such as education, healthcare, and finance. This aligns with the broader goal of developing AI systems that are not only powerful but also accountable and aligned with human values.

By converting the opaque internal computations of LLMs into human-understandable conceptual flows, this research endeavors to make a significant step towards building more transparent, trustworthy, and ultimately more beneficial AI systems.
