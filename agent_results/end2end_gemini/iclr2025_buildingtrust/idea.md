**Title:** Concept-Graph Explanations for LLM Reasoning Chains

**Motivation:** While LLMs can generate complex responses, understanding *how* they arrive at conclusions remains challenging. Current explainability methods often focus on token-level importance, which is insufficient for dissecting multi-step reasoning. This research aims to provide more intuitive, high-level explanations of an LLM's reasoning process.

**Main Idea:** We propose generating "Concept-Graphs" that visually represent an LLM's reasoning chain. This involves:
1.  Probing the LLM's internal states (e.g., attention, hidden activations) during generation.
2.  Developing a technique to map these states to human-understandable concepts or intermediate reasoning steps relevant to the query.
3.  Constructing a directed graph where nodes are concepts and edges represent inferential links, as derived from the LLM's process.
This method would allow users to trace the LLM's "thought process" conceptually, improving transparency and trust, especially in tasks requiring factual accuracy or logical deduction. Expected outcomes include better debugging tools and increased user confidence in LLM outputs.
