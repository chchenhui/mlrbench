## Conclusion

The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Concept-Graph explanations compared to baseline methods. By providing a structured visual representation of the LLM's reasoning process, Concept-Graphs offer more interpretable and faithful explanations of how LLMs arrive at their conclusions.

### Key Findings

1. **Structured Representation:** Concept-Graphs provide a structured representation with an average of 10.0 concepts and 7.0 connections between them.

2. **Concept Granularity:** Concept-Graphs identify more fine-grained concepts (10.0) compared to Chain-of-Thought explanations (6.0 steps).

3. **Visual Interpretation:** Unlike token-based attribution methods, Concept-Graphs provide a visual and conceptual view of reasoning, making it more accessible for human interpretation.

### Future Work

1. **Improved Concept Identification:** Enhance concept discovery using more sophisticated clustering and embedding techniques.
2. **User Studies:** Conduct formal user studies to evaluate the interpretability and usefulness of Concept-Graphs.
3. **Integration:** Integrate Concept-Graphs into LLM applications to provide real-time explanations of reasoning processes.
4. **Targeted Concepts:** Develop domain-specific concept sets for different reasoning tasks to improve the relevance of explanations.
5. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the computation performance to make Concept-Graph generation more efficient for real-time use.
