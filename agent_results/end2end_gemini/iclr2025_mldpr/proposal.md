**1. Title: Adversarially Evolved Benchmarks for Dynamic and Holistic Model Evaluation**

**2. Introduction**

The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) heavily relies on datasets for training, validation, and particularly for benchmarking model capabilities. However, the current ML data ecosystem faces significant challenges, as highlighted by the call for this workshop. Issues such as the over-reliance on a few static benchmark datasets (leading to benchmark-specific overfitting), the under-valuing of data work, ethical concerns within datasets, and an overemphasis on single metrics hinder true progress towards robust and generalizable AI (Sambasivan et al., 2021). The phenomenon of models excelling on benchmark leaderboards but failing in real-world deployments underscores the limitations of current evaluation paradigms. This indicates that models often learn superficial correlations specific to benchmark data distributions rather than acquiring genuine underlying capabilities (Geirhos et al., 2020). There is a pressing need for a paradigm shift in how we evaluate ML models, moving beyond static snapshots to more dynamic, comprehensive, and challenging assessment methods.

This research proposes the development of an "Adversarially Evolved Benchmark" (AEB) system designed to address these critical limitations. The core idea is to create a dynamic ecosystem where a "Benchmark Evolver" (BE) – an AI agent leveraging techniques from evolutionary computation and generative modeling – co-evolves with the ML models being evaluated. The BE's primary objective is to continuously generate or discover novel and challenging data instances, scenarios, or even mini-tasks that expose the weaknesses, biases, and vulnerabilities of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Instead of evaluating models on a fixed set of problems, they will be challenged by an ever-adapting adversary striving to find their breaking points. This approach aims to transform benchmarking from a static assessment into a continuous "stress-testing" process, fostering the development of models that are not only accurate on known distributions but also resilient to unseen challenges and edge cases.

**Research Objectives:**

The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **To design and implement a novel AEB framework:** This involves developing the Benchmark Evolver agent, defining mechanisms for representing and generating diverse and challenging benchmark components, and establishing the co-evolutionary interaction dynamics between the BE and the models under evaluation.
2.  **To investigate the co-evolutionary dynamics of the AEB system:** This includes analyzing how the BE adapts its generated benchmarks in response to improvements in model capabilities, and reciprocally, how models improve when trained or fine-tuned against these evolved challenges.
3.  **To empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the AEB system:** This involves comparing models evaluated and/or trained using the AEB system against models trained using traditional static benchmarks, focusing on improvements in robustness, generalization to unseen data, and the ability to mitigate specific biases or failure modes.
4.  **To develop principles for holistic and dynamic model evaluation:** This involves moving beyond single accuracy metrics to incorporate a suite of measures reflecting resilience, fairness, and adaptability derived from the AEB process.

**Significance:**

This research holds significant potential to catalyze positive changes in the ML data and benchmarking ecosystem. By creating "living benchmarks" that actively probe model weaknesses, we can:
*   **Combat benchmark overfitting:** The dynamic nature of AEB makes it significantly harder for models to overfit to a specific set of challenges.
*   **Promote robust and generalizable AI:** Continuously exposing models to novel, adversarially generated challenges will drive the development of more resilient and adaptable AI systems.
*   **Enable holistic evaluation:** The AEB framework naturally facilitates evaluation across a diverse range of dynamically emerging challenges, providing a more comprehensive understanding of model capabilities and limitations than single-metric leaderboards.
*   **Uncover unknown vulnerabilities and biases:** The BE can be designed to search for specific types of failures or biases, leading to earlier detection and mitigation.
*   **Foster a culture shift:** This work contributes to the broader goal of moving ML research towards a more rigorous and meaningful evaluation culture, aligning with the aims of this workshop. It directly addresses workshop themes such as "overuse of benchmark datasets," "holistic and contextualized benchmarking," and "non-traditional/alternative benchmarking paradigms."

By pushing the boundaries of how ML models are assessed, this research aims to accelerate progress towards AI systems that are not only performant but also trustworthy, reliable, and truly intelligent.

**3. Methodology**

This research will adopt a constructive and empirical approach, involving the design, implementation, and rigorous evaluation of the Adversarially Evolved Benchmark (AEB) system. The methodology is structured around the core components of the AEB framework, the co-evolutionary process, and the experimental design for validation.

**3.1. Overall Framework Architecture**

The AEB system comprises two primary interacting components:
1.  **The Benchmark Evolver (BE):** An AI agent responsible for generating or discovering challenging and diverse benchmark instances, tasks, or data distributions.
2.  **The Target Models (TMs):** The machine learning models being evaluated and, potentially, iteratively improved.

The interaction forms a co-evolutionary loop: the BE generates challenges tailored to exploit weaknesses in current TMs; the TMs are evaluated on these challenges, and their performance provides feedback (fitness signal) to the BE. The BE then adapts to generate new, potentially more sophisticated challenges. Optionally, developers can use these evolved benchmarks to retrain/fine-tune TMs, leading to a co-evolutionary "arms race."

**3.2. The Benchmark Evolver (BE)**

The BE will be implemented primarily using Evolutionary Computation (EC) techniques, inspired by their success in search and optimization tasks, including in conjunction with deep learning (Li et al., 2022).

**3.2.1. Representation of Benchmark Instances/Tasks**
The nature of the "benchmark instances" generated by the BE will depend on the domain. We will initially focus on:
*   **Parameterized Perturbations/Transformations:** For tasks like image classification, the BE can evolve a sequence or a set of parameters for complex data augmentations or transformations (e.g., geometric distortions, photometric changes, adversarial noise patterns, combinations of common corruptions) applied to seed data from existing datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet). Each individual in the BE's population would represent a specific configuration of these transformations.
*   **Generative Model Control:** The BE can evolve inputs to a pre-trained generative model (e.g., GANs, VAEs) or parts of the generator's architecture/parameters to produce novel data samples that are challenging for TMs.
*   **Scenario/Rule Generation (Future Work):** For more complex tasks, the BE could evolve simple rule sets, environmental configurations, or interactive scenarios.

**3.2.2. Evolutionary Algorithm**
We will employ a genetic algorithm (GA) as the core evolutionary engine for the BE.
*   **Population:** A population $P = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_N\}$ of $N$ candidate benchmark configurations (as defined above).
*   **Fitness Function:** The fitness $F(c_i)$ of a candidate benchmark configuration $c_i$ will be crucial. It will be a multi-objective function designed to reward configurations that are:
    *   **Challenging:** They cause high error rates or performance degradation in current SOTA TMs. Let $M_{SOTA}$ be the set of state-of-the-art target models. Let $\text{Perf}(M, D(c_i))$ be the performance (e.g., 1 - accuracy) of model $M$ on data $D(c_i)$ generated by configuration $c_i$.
        $$ \text{Challenge}(c_i, M_{SOTA}) = \frac{1}{|M_{SOTA}|} \sum_{M \in M_{SOTA}} \text{Perf}(M, D(c_i)) $$
    *   **Diverse:** They explore different types of weaknesses compared to other highly fit configurations in the current evolved benchmark set $B_{evolved}$. Diversity can be measured based on the TMs' failure modes (e.g., different misclassified pairs) or based on the characteristics of the generated data itself (e.g., distance in some feature space). Inspired by cMLSGA (Grudniewski & Sobey, 2021), which emphasizes diversity for robust optimization.
        $$ \text{Diversity}(c_i, B_{evolved}) = \min_{c_j \in B_{evolved}, j \neq i} \text{dist}(c_i, c_j) $$
        where $\text{dist}$ is a suitable distance metric.
    *   **Novel (Optional):** They are distinct from training data or previously seen benchmark instances.
    *   **Parsimonious (Optional):** Simpler configurations (e.g., fewer transformations) might be preferred if they achieve similar challenge levels, to better isolate model weaknesses.
    A combined fitness function could be:
    $$ F(c_i) = w_1 \cdot \text{Challenge}(c_i, M_{SOTA}) + w_2 \cdot \text{Diversity}(c_i, B_{evolved}) - w_3 \cdot \text{Complexity}(c_i) $$
    where $w_1, w_2, w_3$ are weighting factors determined empirically or adapted during evolution.

*   **Selection:** Standard selection mechanisms like tournament selection or rank-based selection will be used to choose parent configurations for reproduction.
*   **Genetic Operators:**
    *   **Crossover:** Operators appropriate for the chosen representation (e.g., one-point or uniform crossover for parameter vectors, subtree crossover for tree-based representations of transformation sequences).
    *   **Mutation:** Operators that introduce small variations (e.g., perturbing transformation parameters, adding/removing a transformation, changing a node in a generative network).

**3.3. Target Model Training and Evaluation within the Loop**
TMs will initially be pre-trained SOTA models for the chosen tasks. During the co-evolutionary process:
1.  **Evaluation:** TMs are evaluated on benchmark sets generated by the fittest individuals from the BE's population.
2.  **Feedback:** Performance metrics (accuracy, error types, etc.) are fed back to the BE to compute the fitness of its configurations.
3.  **Adaptation (Optional but key for co-evolution):**
    *   **Automated Retraining:** TMs can be periodically fine-tuned or retrained on a mix of original training data and a curated subset of the adversarially evolved challenging instances. This makes the TMs adapt to the BE.
    *   **Analyst-driven Improvement:** The evolved benchmarks can highlight specific weaknesses to human developers, who then improve the TM architecture or training process.

**3.4. Co-evolutionary Dynamics**
The process operates iteratively:
1.  **Initialization:** Initialize BE population $P_0$ (e.g., randomly or with simple known challenges). Obtain initial set of TMs, $TM_0$.
2.  **Generation t:** At iteration $t$, the BE ($P_t$) generates a challenging benchmark set $B_t$ based on its current fittest configurations, targeting $TM_{t-1}$.
3.  **Evaluation t:** $TM_{t-1}$ (or a new set $TM_t$ if models are also evolving/retraining) are evaluated on $B_t$. Performance data is collected.
4.  **BE Adaptation t:** The fitness of configurations in $P_t$ is calculated based on performance data from step 3. A new BE population $P_{t+1}$ is generated using selection, crossover, and mutation.
5.  **TM Adaptation t (Optional):** If TMs adapt, $TM_t$ becomes $TM_{t+1}$ by retraining/fine-tuning on $B_t$ or insights from it.
6.  **Loop:** Repeat from step 2.

This iterative process is expected to lead to increasingly sophisticated challenges from the BE and, consequently, more robust TMs. We will explore techniques similar to phylogeny-informed interaction estimation (Garbus et al., 2024) to potentially accelerate the co-evolutionary learning process by reducing redundant evaluations, especially if the number of TMs or BE candidates is large. Ideas from MCACEA (Multiple Coordinated Agents Coevolution Evolutionary Algorithm) could be explored if the BE is designed as multiple sub-Evolvers specializing in different types of challenges.

**3.5. Data Source for Benchmark Evolution**
The BE will not typically generate data from scratch, which is resource-intensive and hard to control for semantic consistency. Instead, it will primarily:
*   **Transform Existing Datasets:** Use well-established datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, subsets of GLUE for NLP, UCI datasets for tabular data) as a "substrate." The BE evolves methods to select, combine, or perturb instances from these datasets to create challenges. For example, for image classification, it might select difficult-to-classify images and apply evolved sequences of augmentations.
*   **Leverage Generative Models:** Use pre-trained generative models as a source of diverse raw material, with the BE evolving how to sample or steer these models to produce challenging outputs.

**3.6. Experimental Design and Validation**

We will conduct a series of experiments to validate the AEB framework.

**3.6.1. Domains and Tasks:**
*   **Initial Domain:** Image Classification (CIFAR-10, ImageNet subsets) due to the availability of many SOTA models and established transformation libraries.
*   **Secondary Domains:**
    *   Natural Language Processing (e.g., sentiment analysis on SST-2, paraphrase identification on MRPC), where BE evolves textual perturbations (e.g., synonym replacement, back-translation with targeted noise, sentence structure modifications).
    *   Graph Machine Learning: Comparing against or extending approaches like the Graph Robustness Benchmark (GRB) (Zheng et al., 2021) by having the BE dynamically generate challenging graph structures or feature perturbations.

**3.6.2. Target Model Architectures:**
A selection of widely used and SOTA model architectures for each domain (e.g., ResNets, Vision Transformers for images; BERT, RoBERTa for NLP; GCNs, GATs for graphs).

**3.6.3. Baselines for Comparison:**
1.  **Static Benchmarking:** Models trained and evaluated solely on standard static train/test splits of the chosen datasets.
2.  **Standard Augmentation:** Models trained with common, pre-defined data augmentation techniques.
3.  **Existing Robustness Benchmarks:** Performance on benchmarks like ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019) for image models, or AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021) for NLP models, will serve as external validation of robustness.

**3.6.4. Experimental Protocol:**
*   **Experiment Group 1 (AEB-Evaluated):** Standard models evaluated using benchmarks generated by AEB. This tests AEB's ability to find weaknesses.
*   **Experiment Group 2 (AEB-Hardened):** Models iteratively retrained/fine-tuned using challenging instances curated from AEB's output. This tests AEB's ability to improve model robustness.
*   **Control Group:** Models trained and evaluated using only static benchmarks.

**Comparison metrics:**
Models from AEB-Hardened group will be compared against Control group models on:
    *   Original static test sets (to check for catastrophic forgetting or drop in in-distribution performance).
    *   A diverse set of challenges generated by a *finalized* BE (not used during the AEB-Hardening training).
    *   Third-party, unseen robustness benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet-C, specific adversarial attack suites).

**3.6.5. Evaluation Metrics:**
*   **For Target Models:**
    *   Standard performance metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC.
    *   Robustness metrics: Performance under specific categories of evolved perturbations, resilience to BE-discovered adversarial examples.
    *   Generalization gap: Difference in performance between seen (training/evolved) and unseen (novel static/evolved) challenges.
    *   Bias metrics: If BE is tuned to find fairness-related issues (e.g., performance disparity across demographic subgroups represented in seed data), relevant fairness metrics will be used.
*   **For the AEB System and Evolved Benchmarks:**
    *   **Difficulty:** Average TM performance degradation on evolved benchmarks vs. baseline.
    *   **Diversity:** Coverage of different types of model failure modes or input features exploited by the BE. This could be quantified using clustering of failure patterns or feature attribution methods on the evolved instances.
    *   **Adaptability:** How quickly and effectively the BE generates new challenges when TMs improve.
    *   **Computational Cost:** Resources required for the BE to converge or generate a useful set of challenges.

**3.7. Addressing Key Challenges**
*   **Computational Complexity:** We will employ strategies such as starting with simpler BE representations, using efficient EC operators, exploring surrogate-assisted evolution, leveraging distributed computing, and investigating techniques from works like Garbus et al. (2024) to manage computational costs.
*   **Evaluation Standardization:** While fully dynamic, the AEB *generation process* (BE algorithm, its parameters, seed datasets, specific TMs it interacts with) will be documented. The "product" can be a set of evolved data instances, the BE agent itself (or its configuration), or a report detailing discovered model vulnerabilities. We will propose standardized reporting formats for AEB-driven evaluations.
*   **Meaningfulness of Evolved Instances:** We will incorporate constraints or penalty terms in the BE's fitness function to discourage unrealistic or trivial solutions, possibly using human-in-the-loop validation for initial stages or specific domains.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

This research is anticipated to yield several significant outcomes and have a broad impact on the field of machine learning evaluation and development.

**Expected Outcomes:**

1.  **A Novel Dynamic Benchmarking Framework (AEB Prototype):** The primary outcome will be a functional software prototype of the Adversarially Evolved Benchmark system. This system will include the Benchmark Evolver (BE) agent, interfaces for Target Models (TMs), and the co-evolutionary loop infrastructure. The BE will be configurable for different data modalities and challenge types.
2.  **Empirical Evidence of Enhanced Model Robustness and Generalization:** We expect to demonstrate quantitatively that models trained or fine-tuned using the AEB system exhibit superior robustness to a wider range of perturbations and adversarial conditions, as well as improved generalization to unseen data and tasks, compared to models trained solely on static benchmarks.
3.  **A Curated Collection of Evolved Challenges:** The research will produce collections of challenging data instances, transformations, or scenarios evolved by the BE across different domains (e.g., images, text, graphs). These collections can serve as new, difficult test sets for the community.
4.  **Insights into Model Failure Modes and Biases:** The AEB system will act as an automated "red teaming" tool. Analysis of the instances and scenarios that the BE discovers to be challenging will provide deep insights into the systematic weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and potential biases of current SOTA ML models. This goes beyond simple accuracy scores to understand *why* and *how* models fail.
5.  **Methodology for Holistic and Adaptive Evaluation:** The project will contribute to defining best practices and methodologies for dynamic, adaptive, and holistic model evaluation. This includes proposing new multi-faceted evaluation metrics that capture resilience, adaptability, and the spectrum of capabilities beyond traditional accuracy.
6.  **Open-Source Software and Datasets:** Key components of the AEB framework and selected evolved benchmark datasets will be made publicly available to encourage further research and adoption.

**Impact:**

The proposed research has the potential to significantly impact the ML community and beyond:

1.  **Scientific Impact:**
    *   **Shifting the Evaluation Paradigm:** This work aims to fundamentally alter the way ML models are evaluated, moving from static, often overused benchmarks to a "living," adaptive evaluation process that better reflects real-world complexities and adversarial pressures.
    *   **Driving Development of More Capable AI:** By continuously challenging models with novel failure modes, AEB will incentivize the development of ML architectures and training techniques that are inherently more robust, generalizable, and less prone to superficial pattern matching.
    *   **Advancing Co-evolutionary AI Systems:** The research will contribute to the understanding and application of co-evolutionary algorithms in the context of AI development and evaluation.

2.  **Practical Impact for ML Practitioners:**
    *   **Reducing "Benchmark Hacking":** AEB will make it harder for models to achieve high scores through benchmark-specific overfitting, promoting progress on genuine capabilities.
    *   **Automated Model Debugging and Vulnerability Discovery:** The BE can serve as a powerful tool for developers to automatically discover blind spots and weaknesses in their models before deployment.
    *   **Improved Reliability of Deployed AI:** Models hardened through AEB are expected to be more reliable and perform more predictably when faced with out-of-distribution or adversarial inputs in real-world applications.

3.  **Contribution to Workshop Themes and Broader ML Community:**
    *   This research directly addresses several key themes of "The Future of Machine Learning Data Practices and Repositories" workshop, including "overfitting and overuse of benchmark datasets," "holistic and contextualized benchmarking," "non-traditional/alternative benchmarking paradigms," and "benchmark reproducibility" (by making the generation process reproducible).
    *   It will stimulate discussion and further research into advanced benchmarking techniques and the lifecycle of ML datasets.

4.  **Societal Impact:**
    *   **Safer and Fairer AI:** By actively probing for vulnerabilities and biases (if the BE is guided to do so), the AEB framework can contribute to the development of AI systems that are safer, more equitable, and less likely to cause unintended harm. For example, the BE could be tasked to find instances where model performance significantly differs across protected attributes present in seed data.
    *   **Increased Trust in AI:** More rigorous and comprehensive evaluation methods can lead to increased public trust in AI systems, especially as they are deployed in critical domains.

In conclusion, the Adversarially Evolved Benchmark system proposes a significant step towards a more dynamic, challenging, and insightful evaluation methodology for machine learning. By fostering a co-evolutionary relationship between models and the benchmarks themselves, this research aims to accelerate the development of truly robust, generalizable, and trustworthy AI.
