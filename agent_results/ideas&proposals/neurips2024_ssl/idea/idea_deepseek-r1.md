**Title**: Information-Theoretic Analysis of Task Efficiency in Self-Supervised Learning  

**Motivation**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) relies heavily on well-designed auxiliary tasks, yet their selection remains heuristic, leading to trial-and-error optimization. A theoretical framework is needed to quantify why certain tasks succeed, how they relate to sample efficiency, and how architectures influence their effectiveness. Such insights could transform SSL by enabling principled task design and reducing reliance on exhaustive empirical validation.  

**Main Idea**: Propose an information-theoretic framework to measure the "task utility" of auxiliary objectives. Define utility via the mutual information (MI) between the learned representations and the downstream taskâ€™s latent variables. Introduce MI-based bounds to analyze sample complexity, linking task utility to the minimal data required for convergence. Validate via cross-modal experiments (vision, language, graphs) to correlate high-utility tasks with improved generalization and lower data needs. Expected outcomes: (1) a metric to rank auxiliary tasks, (2) theoretical guarantees on sample efficiency, and (3) architecture guidelines to maximize task utility. Impact: Enables systematic SSL pipeline design, making representation learning more efficient and scalable across domains.
