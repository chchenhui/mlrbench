1. Title  
Principled Design of Auxiliary Tasks via Information Disentanglement in Self-Supervised Learning  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning by replacing costly human labels with auxiliary tasks derived from unlabeled data. Approaches such as contrastive methods (SimCLR, MoCo, PIRL), masked prediction (MAE, BERT), and generative SSL (Imagen, Stable Diffusion) have achieved—or even surpassed—supervised performance across vision, language, speech, graphs, time-series, and multimodal domains. Despite these empirical successes, the design of auxiliary tasks remains largely heuristic. Key questions are unanswered: Why do certain task designs (e.g., contrastive vs. predictive) produce superior representations? How much unlabeled data is necessary? What architectural biases matter? When and why does SSL outperform full supervision?  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice by developing a principled, information-theoretic framework to (1) characterize the properties of effective auxiliary tasks, (2) instantiate novel SSL objectives that explicitly disentangle invariant from variant information, and (3) demonstrate practical gains in transferability, robustness, and fairness. Specifically we will:  
• Formalize representation learning in SSL as a mutual information (MI) game that simultaneously maximizes shared information across augmented views while minimizing information about view-specific nuisances.  
• Derive new contrastive and non-contrastive losses from this formulation, implement them in standard SSL pipelines, and analyze their theoretical properties (e.g., sample complexity, convergence).  
• Empirically validate on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks—comparing with state-of-the-art SimCLR, BYOL, BERT, and joint-embedding methods—to quantify gains in downstream accuracy, robustness to distributional shifts, and reduction of unwanted biases.  

Significance  
A successful theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks will (i) demystify why popular heuristics work, (ii) provide a systematic recipe for tailoring tasks to domain-specific desiderata (e.g., fairness in medical imaging, noise-robust speech recognition), and (iii) advance the next generation of SSL methods that are both interpretable and optimally efficient in data usage.  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Problem Formulation and Notation  
Let $X\in\mathcal{X}$ be an unlabeled datum. We generate two random “views” $V_1,V_2$ of $X$ via stochastic augmentations (e.g., cropping, masking, noise). A neural encoder $f_\theta:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Z}$ maps each view to a representation $Z_i=f_\theta(V_i)$. Let $N_i$ denote latent nuisance variables specific to augmentation $i$. We seek representations that retain the task-relevant (invariant) information $I_{\mathrm{inv}}$ shared by both views, while discarding view-specific nuisance information.  

3.2 Information-Theoretic Objective  
We formalize the desiderata via mutual information:  
  • Maximize $I(Z_1;Z_2)$ to capture invariants shared across views.  
  • Minimize $I(Z_i;N_i)$ for $i\in\{1,2\}$ to disentangle nuisances.  

Combined objective:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{info}}(\theta)  
= -\,I(Z_1;Z_2)\;+\;\beta\bigl[I(Z_1;N_1)+I(Z_2;N_2)\bigr]\,,  
$$  
where $\beta>0$ trades off invariance and disentanglement.  

3.3 Variational Approximations & Loss Derivations  
Direct estimation of mutual information is intractable for high-dimensional $Z,N$. We adopt tractable bounds:  

a) Contrastive approximation (InfoNCE) for $I(Z_1;Z_2)$:  
$$  
\widehat{I}_{\mathrm{NCE}} =  
\mathbb{E}_{\{(z_i,z_i^+)\}_{i=1}^B}\Bigl[  
\log\frac{\exp(\mathrm{sim}(z_i,z_i^+)/\tau)}  
{\sum_{j=1}^B\exp(\mathrm{sim}(z_i,z_j)/\tau)}\Bigr]  
$$  
where $\mathrm{sim}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is cosine similarity, $\tau$ is a temperature and $B$ is batch size. We implement  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{contra}}=-\widehat{I}_{\mathrm{NCE}}\,.  
$$  

b) Variational bound for nuisance MI using adversarial estimation (MINE-style): Introduce a critic network $T_\phi(z,n)$ to approximate  
$$  
I(Z;N)\ge \sup_\phi\;  
\mathbb{E}_{p(z,n)}[T_\phi(z,n)]  
-\log\mathbb{E}_{p(z)p(n)}[\exp(T_\phi(z,n))]\,.  
$$  
We minimize this upper bound via gradient reversal on $\theta$:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{nuis}}(\theta,\phi)=  
\mathbb{E}_{p(z,n)}[T_\phi(z,n)]  
-\log\mathbb{E}_{p(z)p(n)}[\exp(T_\phi(z,n))]\,.  
$$  

c) Non-contrastive instantiation: Inspired by BYOL/SimSiam, we derive a predictor network $h_\psi$ and impose a variance-covariance regularizer, combined with the MI-disentanglement penalty:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{nc}}  
=\|h_\psi(Z_1)-\mathrm{sg}(Z_2)\|_2^2  
+\beta\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{nuis}}\,.  
$$  

3.4 Algorithmic Framework  
Algorithm 1 summarizes the training loop:  

Algorithm 1: Info-Disentangled SSL  
Input: Data loader of unlabeled samples, batch size $B$, augmentations, encoders $f_\theta$, optional predictor $h_\psi$, critics $T_\phi$, hyperparameters $\tau,\beta,\eta$ (learning rates).  
For each minibatch $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^B$:  
  1. Sample augmentations $(v_{i1},v_{i2})\sim\mathcal{A}(x_i)$.  
  2. Compute representations $z_{i1}=f_\theta(v_{i1})$, $z_{i2}=f_\theta(v_{i2})$.  
  3. Compute contrastive loss $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{contra}}$ via InfoNCE.  
  4. Sample nuisance variables $n_{ij}$ for each view (or approximate via augmentation labels).  
  5. Update critic parameters $\phi$ by ascending the MINE objective for $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{nuis}}(\theta,\phi)$.  
  6. Compute total loss for encoder (and predictor):  
     $$  
     \mathcal{L}(\theta,\psi)  
     =\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{contra}}\;+\;\beta\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{nuis}}  
     \quad\text{or}\quad  
     \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{nc}}\,.  
     $$  
  7. Backpropagate and update $\theta,\psi$ with learning rate $\eta$.
