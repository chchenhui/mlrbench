**Key Challenges:**

1. **Theoretical Understanding of Auxiliary Tasks**: Many self-supervised learning tasks are designed heuristically, lacking a clear theoretical foundation that explains their effectiveness. Developing a principled understanding of why certain auxiliary tasks yield good representations remains a significant challenge.

2. **Effective Disentanglement of Representations**: Achieving a clear separation between invariant and variant information in representations is difficult. Ensuring that representations capture shared information across views while discarding view-specific nuisances requires careful design and optimization.

3. **Balancing Mutual Information Objectives**: Simultaneously maximizing mutual information between representations of different views and minimizing mutual information with nuisance variables can be complex. Striking the right balance to achieve effective representation learning without introducing unintended biases is a key challenge.

4. **Scalability to Complex Data Modalities**: Applying information-theoretic approaches to diverse and complex data modalities, such as graphs, time-series, and multimodal data, poses scalability challenges. Ensuring that these methods generalize well across different types of data is crucial for their broader applicability.

5. **Evaluation of Representation Quality**: Developing standardized benchmarks and metrics to assess the quality of representations learned through information-theoretic self-supervised methods is essential. Without consistent evaluation criteria, comparing different approaches and understanding their strengths and limitations becomes challenging.
