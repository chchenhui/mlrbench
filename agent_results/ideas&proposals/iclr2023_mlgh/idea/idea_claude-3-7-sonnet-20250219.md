# ML-Driven Early Warning System for Epidemic Outbreaks

## Motivation
Despite advanced machine learning capabilities, early detection of disease outbreaks remains challenging as demonstrated during COVID-19. Current surveillance systems suffer from data delays, reporting inconsistencies, and limited integration of diverse data sources. Early warning systems that can detect outbreaks days or weeks before traditional surveillance are critically needed to enable timely public health interventions, particularly in resource-limited settings where healthcare infrastructure is fragile and outbreaks can quickly become unmanageable.

## Main Idea
We propose developing a multi-modal early warning system that integrates disparate data streams through a novel hierarchical attention framework. The system would combine traditional epidemiological data with digital traces (search queries, social media, mobility patterns), environmental signals (wastewater surveillance, climate data), and healthcare system indicators (medication purchases, hospital admissions). The core innovation lies in a semi-mechanistic architecture that incorporates epidemic dynamics knowledge while remaining flexible enough to detect novel patterns. The system would employ transfer learning techniques to adapt to low-resource settings with sparse data and include interpretability mechanisms to provide actionable insights to public health officials. By detecting outbreaks 1-2 weeks earlier than traditional methods, this system could significantly reduce morbidity and mortality while building global capacity for pandemic preparedness.
