**Title:** Federated Domain Adaptation for Robust Disease Surveillance in Resource-Limited Settings

**Motivation:** Global health initiatives often face challenges with data scarcity, heterogeneity across locations, and strict privacy regulations, hindering the development of effective machine learning models for tasks like disease surveillance. Centralized data analysis is frequently impractical. This research addresses the need for models that can learn collaboratively from decentralized, diverse datasets while preserving privacy.

**Main Idea:** We propose a federated learning framework enhanced with unsupervised domain adaptation. Participating health institutions train local models on their specific data (e.g., clinical records, syndromic surveillance). Instead of simple model averaging, the federated aggregation step incorporates domain adaptation techniques (e.g., gradient reversal layers, moment matching) to align the feature representations learned by local models, accounting for variations in data distributions (e.g., demographics, reporting standards). This approach aims to build a robust, generalized global model capable of accurate disease prediction across diverse settings, even with limited local data, improving pandemic preparedness and resource allocation without compromising data privacy.
