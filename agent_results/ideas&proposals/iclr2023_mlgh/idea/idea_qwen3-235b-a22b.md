**1. Title**  
*Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Equitable Global Health Analytics*  

**2. Motivation**  
Global health data is fragmented, with critical disparities in data availability and quality across regions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, siloed data and privacy constraints hindered the development of robust predictive models, leading to reactive policies and inequitable outcomes. Existing machine learning approaches often fail to account for these disparities, limiting their applicability in low-resource settings. Addressing this gap requires a framework that enables collaborative model training without compromising data sovereignty or privacy, thereby improving pandemic preparedness and health equity.  

**3. Main Idea**  
We propose a federated learning framework tailored for global health, integrating **domain-agnostic models** and **adaptive data harmonization** to address heterogeneous data distributions across regions. The framework will use privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., differential privacy and secure aggregation) to enable decentralized training on sensitive epidemiological and clinical data. A key innovation is *synthetic data distillation*, where agents generate privacy-compliant synthetic datasets to improve model generalizability in data-scarce regions. Additionally, we incorporate causal modeling to identify policy-relevant interventions by explicitly accounting for socioeconomic confounders. Methodology will involve benchmarking against real-world datasets (e.g., household surveys, genomic sequences) and collaborating with NGOs to validate utility in predicting vaccine response dynamics and resource allocation gaps. Success will be measured via improved accuracy in cross-region outbreak forecasts, reduced computational costs for low-resource deployments, and stakeholder trust in data-sharing workflows. This work aims to bridge technical and ethical challenges, empowering equitable, ML-driven policy responses to future health crises.
