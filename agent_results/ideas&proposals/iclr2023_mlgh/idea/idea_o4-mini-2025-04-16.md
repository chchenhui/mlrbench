Title: Federated Semi-Mechanistic Graph Modeling for Early Outbreak Detection

Motivation:
Timely detection of infectious disease outbreaks in low-resource regions is hampered by data silos and privacy concerns. Bridging mechanistic epidemiology with machine learning under a privacy-preserving regime can deliver early warnings without centralized data aggregation, fostering wider adoption and actionable insights for policy makers.

Main Idea:
We propose a federated learning framework that integrates semi-mechanistic compartmental models with graph neural networks (GNNs). Each participating health center trains a local model using its own time-series of case counts, mobility proxies, and environmental covariates. Local updates are combined via a differentially private aggregation server to learn a global GNN that encodes inter-region connectivity and transmission heterogeneity. The semi-mechanistic layer embeds known disease dynamics (e.g., SIR compartments) while the GNN captures spatial correlations and latent drivers. Periodic model fusion yields probabilistic, geographically granular outbreak forecasts. We will evaluate on retrospective COVID-19 and dengue datasets, measuring lead-time gains and spatial accuracy against centralized baselines. This approach empowers stakeholders with privacy-compliant, interpretable tools for proactive, localized public-health interventions in low-and middle-income settings.
