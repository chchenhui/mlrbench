1. **Title**: Understanding the Generalization of In-Context Learning in Transformers: An Empirical Study (2503.15579)
   - **Authors**: Xingxuan Zhang, Haoran Wang, Jiansheng Li, Yuan Xue, Shikai Guan, Renzhe Xu, Hao Zou, Han Yu, Peng Cui
   - **Summary**: This study systematically investigates transformers' generalization capabilities in in-context learning (ICL) across three dimensions: inter-problem, intra-problem, and intra-task generalization. Through extensive experiments on tasks like function fitting, API calling, and translation, the authors find that transformers excel in intra-task and intra-problem generalization but lack inter-problem generalization. They suggest that increasing the diversity of tasks in training data enhances ICL's generalization abilities.

2. **Title**: Transformers learn in-context by gradient descent (2212.07677)
   - **Authors**: Johannes von Oswald, Eyvind Niklasson, Ettore Randazzo, Jo√£o Sacramento, Alexander Mordvintsev, Andrey Zhmoginov, Max Vladymyrov
   - **Summary**: This paper explores the mechanisms behind in-context learning in transformers, proposing that training transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to gradient-based meta-learning. The authors demonstrate that transformers can implement gradient descent in their forward pass, effectively becoming mesa-optimizers. They also show that transformers can surpass plain gradient descent by learning iterative curvature corrections and linear models on deep data representations to solve non-linear regression tasks.

They also show that attention-free models perform similarly to transformers on various tasks. Additionally, the study demonstrates that transformers can learn to implement multiple algorithms for a single task and adaptively select the more sample-efficient one based on in-context examples.
