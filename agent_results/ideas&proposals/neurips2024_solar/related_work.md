**Key Challenges:**

1. **Limited Training Data**: Low-resource languages often lack sufficient annotated data, making it difficult to train robust and accurate language models.

2. **Linguistic Diversity**: The unique morphological and syntactic features of low-resource languages pose challenges for adapting existing interpretability methods.

3. **Code-Switching**: Frequent switching between languages within a single discourse complicates model training and interpretation.

4. **Community Engagement**: Ensuring that explanation interfaces align with cultural communication norms requires active collaboration with native speaker communities.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Developing metrics that assess both technical robustness and user-perceived trust is essential for evaluating model transparency and effectiveness.
