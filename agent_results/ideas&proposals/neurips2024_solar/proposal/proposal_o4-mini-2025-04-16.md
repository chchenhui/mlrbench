Title: Interpretable Language Models for Low-Resource Languages: Enhancing Transparency and Equity

1. Introduction  
Background  
Low-resource languages—spoken by millions worldwide—remain under-served by modern language models (LMs). The scarcity of annotated corpora, the diversity of morphological and syntactic phenomena, and frequent code-switching present challenges for both performance and accountability. Most existing interpretability techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP) were developed on high-resource, morphologically simple languages and fail to capture the rich linguistic structure of under-represented tongues. At the same time, without transparent explanations, marginalized communities cannot detect biases, errors, or dangerous misrepresentations in automated outputs. These gaps hinder fair access to NLP technologies and risk exacerbating digital inequities.

Research Objectives  
1. Develop a unified interpretability framework tailored to low-resource languages that incorporates morphological, syntactic, and code-switching features.  
2. Adapt and extend local explanation methods (SHAP, LIME) to handle minimal data regimes and linguistic complexity.  
3. Co-design explanation interfaces in collaboration with native speaker communities to ensure cultural alignment and usability.  
4. Define and validate a set of evaluation metrics that capture both technical robustness (fidelity, stability) and community-perceived trust.

Significance  
This project advances socially responsible AI by combining technical innovation with community engagement. We will release open-source tools, annotated datasets, and design guidelines that practitioners can adopt to audit and improve LMs for any low-resource language. The anticipated impact includes reduced bias, increased transparency, and stronger trust between technology providers and linguistic communities.

2. Methodology  
Our methodology comprises four interlocking stages: data collection and preprocessing, model training, interpretability method adaptation, and human-centered evaluation.

2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
– Language Selection: We will focus on three typologically diverse low-resource languages exhibiting rich morphology and common code-switching patterns (e.g., Swahili, Quechua, and a South Asian mixed variety).  
– Corpora Assembly:  
  • Monolingual text from web-crawled corpora (e.g., OSCAR, CommonCrawl) filtered via language identification (GlotLID-M).  
  • Parallel and comparable corpora (Bible translations, religious texts, public domain literature) to support downstream tasks.  
  • Community contributions: user-generated text from social media groups and local organizations.  
– Annotation: We will annotate a small subset (5,000 sentences per language) for morphological features (POS tags, affixes) and code-switch boundaries using expert native speakers.  
– Preprocessing pipeline:  
  1. Normalization: unify orthographies, remove noise.  
  2. Tokenization: subword segmentation using SentencePiece with a vocabulary size of 8k per language.  
  3. Morphological segmentation: apply unsupervised morphological analyzers (e.g., Morfessor) and human-verified corrections.

2.2 Model Training  
We propose a lightweight transformer LM with 50M parameters, balancing performance and resource constraints. Architecture details:  
– 6 Transformer layers, hidden size 512, 8 attention heads, feed-forward size 2048.  
– Pretraining objective: masked language modeling (MLM) with masking probability 15%.  
– Code-switching augmentation: randomly replace 5–15% of target language tokens with tokens from a high-resource pivot language (e.g., English) during training.  
– Optimization: AdamW with learning rate $1\mathrm{e}{-4}$, linear warm-up over 5k steps, total 200k steps, batch size 256.  
– Training on multi-GPU cluster, gradient accumulation to simulate batch size 1024 when needed.

2.3 Adaptation of Interpretability Methods  
We will extend two widely used local explanation techniques, SHAP and LIME, to generate linguistically grounded explanations.

2.3.1 Morphological SHAP  
Standard SHAP computes feature attributions via Shapley values:  
$$
\phi_i \;=\;\sum_{S\subseteq F\setminus\{i\}}\frac{|S|!(|F|-|S|-1)!}{|F|!}\Bigl[f_{S\cup\{i\}}(x_{S\cup\{i\}})-f_S(x_S)\Bigr]\,,
$$  
where $F$ is the full feature set. In low-resource settings, $|F|$ (number of tokens) is small but each token carries rich morphological sub-features. We will:  
1. Factor features into token-level and morph-level sets (e.g., root, affix, POS).  
2. Approximate Shapley value sums by grouping morph features into clusters to reduce exponential complexity.  
3. Incorporate a hierarchical kernel that penalizes coalition changes more heavily at the token level than the morph-level to reflect linguistic relevance.  
4. Validate approximation error bounds via sampling-based estimates.

2.3.2 Morphological LIME  
LIME fits a local surrogate linear model around an instance $x$ by sampling perturbed inputs $x'$ and weighting them by proximity:  
$$
\pi(x,x') = \exp\Bigl(-\frac{D(x,x')^2}{\sigma^2}\Bigr)\,.
$$  
We will extend LIME by:  
– Defining $D(x,x')$ to account for both token edit distance and morphological edit distance (e.g., Levenshtein on morpheme sequences).  
– Constraining perturbations to morph-aware masks (e.g., masking affixes rather than whole tokens) to preserve grammaticality.  
– Selecting $\sigma$ via cross-validation on a held-out explanation fidelity set.

2.3.3 Code-Switch Explanation  
To handle code-switching, we will train a lightweight classifier to detect switch points and treat them as special “features.” Explanations will highlight not only salient tokens but also switch boundaries. The classifier is trained via annotated code-switch data and optimized with cross-entropy.

2.4 Community-Driven Interface Design  
We will organize three co-design workshops per language community. Each workshop cycle proceeds as follows:  
1. Prototype Explanation: present initial static HTML interfaces with token-level heatmaps and morph-feature bars.  
2. User Feedback: collect qualitative feedback via structured interviews and surveys (Likert scales on clarity, cultural alignment).  
3. Iteration: refine color schemes, symbol choices, and interaction flows (e.g., tap to reveal morph analyses).  
4. Finalize a mobile-first and web-based tool supporting interactive explanation inspection.

2.5 Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics  
We measure both technical and human-centric performance:

2.5.1 Technical Robustness  
– Perplexity on held-out test sets before and after interpretability adaptations.  
– Explanation fidelity: correlation between surrogate explanations and true model behavior (using comprehensiveness and sufficiency metrics).  
– Stability: average standard deviation of feature attributions under small perturbations (e.g., adding noise to embeddings).  
– Code-switch fidelity: accuracy of highlighting true switch points.

2.5.2 Human Trust and Usability  
– Task-based trials: participants use explanations to validate or correct model outputs (e.g., translation quality judgments). We record accuracy improvements and time to decision.  
– Trust surveys: adapted from Xu et al. (2022), measuring perceived fairness, transparency, and reliability on seven-point scales.  
– Cultural alignment score: qualitative coding of user comments into categories (e.g., “intuitive,” “misleading,” “culturally off”).

2.5.3 Bias and Equity Analysis  
– Automatic demographic bias tests: evaluate generated text for harmful stereotypes using templates in each language.  
– Comparison of bias scores pre- and post-interpretability intervention to assess whether transparency reduces harmful patterns.

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Outcomes  
– Open-source toolkit (“MorphExplain”) integrating adapted SHAP, LIME, and code-switch explanation modules for any low-resource language.  
– Annotated morphological and code-switch datasets (5k sentences × 3 languages) released under permissive licenses.  
– Design guidelines and templates for community-driven explanation interfaces in under-served languages.  
– Peer-reviewed publications at top NLP and interdisciplinary venues (e.g., Transactions of the ACL, SoLaR).

Impact  
– Empowered linguistic communities will gain tools to audit and refine LMs, fostering local control and reducing the risk of unchecked biases.  
– Researchers and practitioners will have a validated, reproducible framework for building transparent LMs in minimal-data regimes.  
– By lowering the barrier to interpretability in low-resource contexts, this work strengthens global equity in NLP, aligning with the goals of socially responsible AI.  
– Insights from human-centered evaluations can inform policy recommendations for transparent deployment of LMs in education, health, and public services in underserved regions.

In sum, this proposal combines technical rigor with community engagement to deliver culturally grounded, interpretable LMs for low-resource languages. It addresses pressing needs in fairness, transparency, and inclusivity and will yield tangible tools and guidelines to accelerate equitable NLP worldwide.
