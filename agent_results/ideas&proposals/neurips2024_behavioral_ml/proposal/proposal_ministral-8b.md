## Title: Cognitive Architecture-Guided Training for Human-Like Reasoning in Language Models

## Introduction

### Background

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, demonstrating impressive performance in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. However, their outputs often lack transparency and human-like reasoning, limiting their trustworthiness and alignment with human expectations. This gap can be bridged by integrating formal cognitive models, which simulate human memory, attention, and problem-solving processes, into the training and inference of LLMs. By grounding LLM decisions in validated psychological processes, we can enhance their interpretability and alignment with human cognition.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a framework that integrates computational cognitive architectures into the training and inference of LLMs to produce outputs that are both performant and psychologically interpretable. Specifically, the research aims to:

1. Design a hybrid training objective that combines language modeling loss with alignment to cognitive model "traces" to structure latent reasoning pathways in LLMs.
2. Implement a constrained decoding mechanism that prioritizes token sequences matching cognitive architecture-predicted steps.
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through behavioral congruence with human experiments and user-perceived naturalness.

### Significance

This research is significant because it addresses a critical gap in the current state-of-the-art in LLMs, which often lack transparent, human-like reasoning. By integrating cognitive architectures, we can enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs, making them more suitable for applications in education, healthcare, and human-AI collaboration. Moreover, this interdisciplinary approach fosters collaboration between computer scientists and behavioral scientists, driving progress in the integration of insights from the behavioral sciences into AI systems.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed methodology involves two key components: a hybrid training objective and a constrained decoding mechanism. These components will be integrated into the training and inference processes of LLMs to guide their reasoning pathways based on cognitive architectures.

#### 1. Hybrid Training Objective

The hybrid training objective combines language modeling loss with alignment to cognitive model "traces" to structure latent reasoning pathways in LLMs. This objective includes:

- **Language Modeling Loss**: The standard language modeling loss, which measures the probability of the target sequence given the input sequence.
- **Cognitive Model Alignment Loss**: A penalty term that measures the deviation of LLM reasoning pathways from cognitive model predictions. This term is designed to encourage the LLM to produce outputs that mimic the step-by-step reasoning processes of cognitive architectures.

The hybrid training objective can be formulated as follows:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{hybrid}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{lm}} + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{cm}}
$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{lm}}$ is the language modeling loss, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{cm}}$ is the cognitive model alignment loss, and $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter that controls the weight of the cognitive model alignment term.

#### 2. Constrained Decoding Mechanism

The constrained decoding mechanism prioritizes token sequences that match cognitive architecture-predicted steps during inference. This mechanism involves:

- **Cognitive Architecture Predictions**: Using the cognitive architecture to predict the next step in the reasoning process based on the current context.
- **Constrained Sampling**: During inference, the decoding process is constrained to prioritize token sequences that match the cognitive architecture-predicted steps.

The constrained decoding mechanism can be implemented using a sampling-based approach, such as beam search or nucleus sampling, with an additional constraint that the top-k or top-p tokens must match the cognitive architecture-predicted steps.

### Experimental Design

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we will conduct a series of experiments that evaluate the behavioral congruence with human experiments and user-perceived naturalness of the generated outputs. The experimental design includes:

- **Datasets**: We will use a combination of synthetic datasets generated using cognitive architectures and real-world datasets that require human-like reasoning.
- **Baseline Models**: We will compare the performance of the proposed framework with baseline models that do not incorporate cognitive architectures.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: We will use a combination of automatic and human evaluation metrics to assess the behavioral congruence and naturalness of the generated outputs. The automatic metrics will include perplexity, BLEU score, and ROUGE score. The human evaluation metrics will include human annotators rating the naturalness and correctness of the generated outputs.

### Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation metrics used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework include:

- **Perplexity**: A measure of how well the model predicts a held-out test set. Lower perplexity indicates better performance.
- **BLEU Score**: A metric that evaluates the similarity between the generated outputs and the reference texts. Higher BLEU scores indicate better performance.
- **ROUGE Score**: A metric that evaluates the overlap between the generated outputs and the reference texts. Higher ROUGE scores indicate better performance.
- **Human Evaluation**: Human annotators will rate the naturalness and correctness of the generated outputs on a scale of 1 to 5. The ratings will be aggregated to compute the mean and standard deviation.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

The expected outcomes of this research include:

- A novel framework for integrating cognitive architectures into the training and inference of LLMs to enhance their interpretability and human-like reasoning.

- A constrained decoding mechanism that prioritizes token sequences matching cognitive architecture-predicted steps during inference.
- Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in producing outputs that are both performant and psychologically interpretable.

### Impact

The impact of this research is expected to be significant in several ways:

- **Enhanced Interpretability**: By integrating cognitive architectures into LLMs, we can enhance their interpretability, making their reasoning processes more transparent and understandable to humans.
- **Improved Trustworthiness**: LLMs with enhanced interpretability are more likely to be trusted by users, especially in critical domains such as healthcare and education.
- **Better Alignment with Human Cognition**: The proposed framework aims to align LLM outputs with human cognition, making them more intuitive and natural to users.
- **Fostering Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: This research promotes collaboration between computer scientists and behavioral scientists, driving progress in the integration of insights from the behavioral sciences into AI systems.

In conclusion, this research aims to bridge the gap between LLMs and human cognition by integrating cognitive architectures into the training and inference of LLMs. By enhancing their interpretability and human-like reasoning, we can make LLMs more trustworthy, intuitive, and aligned with human expectations.
