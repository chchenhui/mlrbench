**Title:** Domain-Guided Neural Architecture Search for Inherently Interpretable Models  

**Motivation:** Current interpretability methods for large models often rely on post-hoc explanations, which may lack faithfulness. Domain-specific applications (e.g., healthcare, materials science) demand models that align with established principles and constraints, necessitating inherently interpretable architectures infused with expert knowledge.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a framework to automatically design neural networks whose architectures and intermediate features are constrained by domain-specific rules. By integrating domain knowledge (e.g., medical guidelines, physical laws) as structural priors in a Neural Architecture Search (NAS), the method ensures critical decision factors are explicitly encoded into modular, human-understandable components (e.g., attention layers mirroring causal relationships or filters representing known biomarkers). Techniques like constrained optimization and symbolic rule injection will guide the NAS to prioritize architectures that balance performance and explainability. Outcomes include models with verifiable, domain-aligned reasoning paths, validated through case studies in healthcare diagnostics and materials design. The approach aims to bridge the performance-interpretability gap, enabling trustworthy deployment in high-stakes domains while maintaining competitive accuracy.
