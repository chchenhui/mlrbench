Title  
Interpretable Foundation Models Through Multi‐Level Knowledge Distillation

1. Introduction  
Background  
As foundation models scale to billions or trillions of parameters, their decision processes become opaque “black boxes.” In high‐stakes domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, criminal justice), opaque reasoning hinders trust, auditability, regulatory compliance, and bias detection. Post‐hoc explanation techniques (LIME, SHAP, saliency maps) often yield unfaithful or incomplete explanations. An alternative is to embed interpretability directly into the model via “interpretability islands”—transparent modules or summaries within the larger network. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a principled way to transfer behaviors from a complex “teacher” model to a simpler, inherently interpretable “student” model.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a multi‐level KD framework that:  
• Extracts concept‐based representations from foundation models and aligns them with human concepts.  
• Identifies and distills critical decision paths into transparent rule‐based structures.  
• Integrates neural and symbolic components into coherent, interpretable sub‐modules.  
• Selectively targets high‐impact sub‐networks to balance interpretability with end‐to‐end performance.  

Significance  
By embedding interpretability islands in foundation models, we enable different stakeholder needs—from lay end‐users requiring high‐level concept summaries to auditors requiring precise decision traces—without sacrificing overall model accuracy. This research advances the frontier of inherently interpretable AI, bridges the gap between deep learning and human understanding, and addresses regulatory pressures for transparent AI.  

2. Literature Review  
Existing work in KD‐based interpretability reveals four themes:  
1. Interpretable Distillation (Smith et al., 2023): transfers knowledge to smaller transparent models, achieving minimal accuracy loss.  
2. Concept‐Based Distillation (Martinez & Kim, 2023): maps latent activations to predefined human‐understandable concepts via linear probes.  
3. Decision Path Extraction (Zhang & Patel, 2023): derives rule‐based decision paths by imitating teacher activations on representative inputs.  
4. Neural‐Symbolic Integration (Liu & Gonzalez, 2023): integrates symbolic reasoning blocks trained to mimic neural sub‐graphs.  

Key challenges remain: (i) identifying which model components are critical for interpretability, (ii) maintaining fidelity of student modules, (iii) scaling to foundation‐scale architectures, and (iv) balancing performance vs. interpretability. We build on “Selective Distillation” (Brown & Nguyen, 2023) and “Multi‐Level KD” (Singh & Zhao, 2023) to propose a unified framework that addresses these challenges systematically.  

3. Methodology  
Overview  
Our framework comprises three components—Concept‐Based Distillation, Decision Path Extraction, and Neural‐Symbolic Integration—coordinated by a Selective Module Identification (SMI) process. The overall pipeline is shown in Figure 1 (omitted here).  

3.1 Selective Module Identification (SMI)  
We first quantify the “decision impact” of each sub‐network or transformer block using a Shapley‐based importance score. Let the foundation model be partitioned into modules $M_1,\dots,M_K$. For a validation dataset $\mathcal{D}_{val}$, we define the contribution of module $M_i$ to the teacher’s predictions as:  
$$\phi_i = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}_{val}|}\sum_{x\in \mathcal{D}_{val}} \bigl[T(x) - T_{-M_i}(x)\bigr],$$  
where $T(\cdot)$ is the teacher output (logits) and $T_{-M_i}(\cdot)$ is the output with $M_i$ ablated or randomized. Modules with top‐$r$ highest $\phi_i$ are selected for interpretability distillation.  

3.2 Concept‐Based Distillation  
For each selected module $M_i$, we collect its latent activations $\{h^i(x)\mid x\in\mathcal{D}_{train}\}$. We assume a set of human‐understandable concepts $\mathcal{C}=\{c_1,\dots,c_C\}$ with labeled concept examples $\{(x,c_j)\}$. We train a concept classifier $f_i: h^i(x)\mapsto p(c\mid h^i)$ by minimizing cross‐entropy:  
$$\mathcal{L}_\text{concept} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^C \mathbf{1}\{c_j\}\log f_i(h^i(x_n))\,. $$  
We then train a “student” concept‐mapping module $S^i_\text{concept}$ with a shallow transparent architecture (e.g., sparse linear model or small decision tree) to mimic $f_i$. The distillation loss is:  
$$\mathcal{L}_\text{KD} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^C f_i(h^i(x_n))\log S^i_\text{concept}(h^i(x_n))\,. $$  

3.3 Decision Path Extraction  
We generate a representative input set $\mathcal{D}_{path}$ by sampling near‐decision‐boundary examples for each class. For each sample $x\in \mathcal{D}_{path}$, we record the internal activations and gating decisions (e.g., attention heads, ReLU activations) across selected modules. We then train a rule learner (e.g., RIPPER or decision list) to map these activation patterns to final predictions. Formally, let $\psi(x)\in\{0,1\}^d$ be a binary vector capturing thresholded activations; we learn a rule‐based model $R_i$ minimizing:  
$$\mathcal{L}_\text{rule} = \sum_{x\in\mathcal{D}_{path}} \mathbf{1}\{R_i(\psi(x))\neq T(x)\}\,. $$  
To ensure interpretability, we constrain $R_i$ to at most $L$ rules and each rule to at most $K$ predicates.  

3.4 Neural‐Symbolic Integration  
For particularly complex sub‐graphs (e.g., multi‐head attention blocks), we extract a symbolic surrogate by program synthesis. We approximate the continuous mapping $h\mapsto w^\top h$ by deriving a piecewise‐linear symbolic function. Using the Distilling Decision Trees through Program Synthesis (DDTPS) algorithm, we:  
(1) Partition the activation space via k‐means clustering,  
(2) Fit local linear terms in each cluster: $g_m(h)=a_m^\top h + b_m$,  
(3) Encode the partitioning and local functions as an if‐then symbolic program.  
The synthesis objective is:  
$$\min_{g}\ \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{h\in \text{cluster}_m}\bigl(T_i(h)-g_m(h)\bigr)^2 + \lambda\,\text{Size}(g)\,. $$  

3.5 Integrated Training and Fine‐Tuning  
Finally, we embed the distilled modules $\{S^i_\text{concept},R_i,g\}$ back into a student model $S$. During fine‐tuning on the original task dataset $\mathcal{D}_{train}$, we enforce consistency between $S$ and teacher $T$ via a combined loss:  
$$\mathcal{L} = \alpha\mathcal{L}_\text{task}(S) + \beta\,\mathrm{KL}\bigl(S(x)\,\|\,T(x)\bigr) + \gamma\sum_i\mathcal{L}^i_\text{interpret}\,, $$  
where $\mathcal{L}_\text{task}$ is the standard cross‐entropy on labels, and $\mathcal{L}^i_\text{interpret}$ enforces that student modules reproduce concept probabilities, decision paths, and symbolic outputs.

1. Task Performance: accuracy, F1‐score on held‐out test.  
2. Fidelity: average KL divergence $\mathrm{KL}(S(x)\,\|\,T(x))$.  
3. Interpretability:  
  – Concept Alignment Score: average precision/recall of student concept predictions vs. ground‐truth.  
  – Rule Complexity: number of rules $|R_i|$ and average predicates per rule.

4. Human Evaluation:  
  – Trustworthiness rating by domain experts (1–5 scale).  
  – Time to debug or verify a decision path.  

We will perform statistical tests (paired t‐tests and Wilcoxon signed‐rank tests) to compare baselines and ablations. Ablation studies will disable each distillation component to quantify its contribution.

Expected Outcomes  
1. A unified, open‐source framework enabling selective multi‐level KD for foundation models, with modular APIs for concept, path, and symbolic distillation.  
2. Empirical evidence that selective KD yields interpretability islands with minimal (<2%) accuracy degradation, outperforming single‐level and post‐hoc baselines on fidelity and transparency metrics.  
3. Quantitative analyses of the trade‐off frontier between interpretability (rule complexity, concept alignment) and model performance across tasks and domains.  
4. A library of distilled interpretable modules (e.g., concept classifiers, rule sets, symbolic programs) for popular foundation models.  

Broader Impact  
• Trust & Adoption: By making AI reasoning transparent, stakeholders in regulated industries (healthcare, finance) can audit and validate model decisions efficiently.  
• Demystification: Researchers gain tools to probe and understand latent representations in large models, advancing fundamental scientific knowledge of mechanistic interpretability.  
• Regulation & Compliance: Provides a blueprint for interpretable AI in contexts where legal mandates (e.g., GDPR “right to explanation”) apply.  
• Education & Accessibility: Interpretable modules serve as teaching aids to help students and non‐experts understand complex model behaviors.  

Future Directions  
This research opens avenues for:  
• Dynamic interpretability: on‐the‐fly selection of modules based on input complexity or user role.  
• Across‐modal distillation: extending to audio, video, and multimodal foundation models.  
• Interactive interpretability: integrating user feedback loops to refine concepts and rules.  

In sum, our multi‐level KD framework bridges the performance‐interpretability gap in foundation models by creating targeted interpretability islands, empowering diverse stakeholders with transparent, faithful, and actionable model explanations.
