## **1. Title:** **Distilling Transparency: A Multi-Level Knowledge Distillation Framework for Interpretable Foundation Models**

---

## **2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Foundation Models (FMs), such as large language models (e.g., GPT series, BERT) and vision transformers (ViT), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, revolutionizing fields from natural language processing to computer Vvsion. However, their immense scale and complexity, often involving billions or trillions of parameters, render them inherently opaque "black boxes." This lack of transparency poses significant challenges. Understanding *how* these models arrive at their decisions is crucial for debugging, ensuring fairness, identifying potential biases, establishing trust, verifying safety, and complying with emerging regulatory requirements (Task Description; [White & Patel, 2023]). In high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where model errors can have severe consequences, the inability to interpret model reasoning is a critical bottleneck for responsible deployment.

Traditional interpretable machine learning methods, such as decision trees or sparse linear models, while transparent, often fail to capture the complex patterns learned by FMs and do not scale effectively to the high-dimensional data and intricate architectures involved. Conversely, post-hoc explanation techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP), which attempt to explain predictions of pre-trained black-box models, can sometimes provide insights but suffer from limitations. They may offer explanations that are not faithful to the model's internal reasoning process, providing potentially misleading justifications, especially for complex models like FMs. This lack of fidelity makes them unreliable for applications demanding high levels of accountability and trust (Task Description). Consequently, there is a pressing need for methods that can imbue large-scale FMs with inherent interpretability, offering truthful and complete explanations by design.

**2.2 Research Gap and Motivation**
Recent research has explored knowledge distillation (KD) as a promising avenue for transferring capabilities from large, complex "teacher" models to smaller, potentially more interpretable "student" models ([Smith et al., 2023]). Several works have specifically investigated using KD for interpretability, focusing on aspects like concept mapping ([Martinez & Kim, 2023]), decision path extraction ([Zhang & Patel, 2023]), neural-symbolic integration ([Liu & Gonzalez, 2023]), and creating interpretable modules ([Chen & O'Connor, 2023]). However, these approaches often address interpretability at a single level or focus on specific aspects in isolation.

A significant gap remains in developing a *unified and flexible framework* specifically designed to handle the scale and multifaceted nature of FMs, providing different *levels* and *types* of interpretation tailored to diverse stakeholder needs (e.g., end-users, developers, auditors). Existing methods face challenges in balancing interpretability with performance ([Wilson & Park, 2023]), identifying the most critical model components for interpretation ([Brown & Nguyen, 2023]), ensuring the fidelity of distilled interpretations, scaling effectively ([Singh & Zhao, 2023]), and seamlessly integrating different interpretability paradigms (e.g., conceptual, rule-based) (Lit. Review Challenges). Our motivation stems from the need to bridge this gap by proposing a systematic, multi-level KD framework that selectively introduces interpretability into FMs where it is most needed, creating verifiable "interpretability islands" within the larger model architecture.

**2.3 Proposed Research and Objectives**
This research proposes a novel **Multi-Level Knowledge Distillation Framework for Interpretable Foundation Models (MLKD-IFM)**. The core idea is to selectively distill knowledge from specific components or layers of a pre-trained FM (the teacher) into different types of inherently interpretable student modules, corresponding to distinct levels of abstraction:

1.  **Concept-Level Interpretation:** Distilling intermediate FM representations into mappings onto human-understandable concepts.
2.  **Decision-Path Interpretation:** Extracting localized, step-by-step reasoning processes underlying specific predictions into transparent formats like decision trees or rule lists.
3.  **Neural-Symbolic Module Interpretation:** Converting functional sub-components of the FM into symbolic representations (e.g., logical rules) that are formally verifiable.

Crucially, this distillation will be *selective*, targeting components identified as having high decision impact or relevance for transparency needs, thereby aiming to preserve the FM's overall performance while enhancing its interpretability in key areas.

The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **To design and develop the MLKD-IFM framework**, defining the architecture, distillation strategies, and integration mechanisms for the different interpretability levels.
2.  **To implement methodologies for concept-based distillation** suitable for FM representations, enabling the mapping of latent features to meaningful concepts.
3.  **To develop techniques for extracting faithful decision paths** from FMs for specific inputs or decision types using targeted distillation into rule-based or tree-based structures.
4.  **To investigate methods for converting selected neural sub-modules of FMs into verifiable symbolic counterparts** via neural-symbolic distillation.
5.  **To devise a principled approach for identifying critical FM components** for selective distillation based on attribution, influence, or task-relevance metrics.
6.  **To empirically evaluate the MLKD-IFM framework** on benchmark FMs and datasets, assessing the trade-offs between interpretability, fidelity to the original model, and task performance.
7.  **To demonstrate the utility of the multi-level interpretations** generated by the framework for different stakeholder needs (e.g., debugging, auditing, user understanding).

**2.4 Significance**
This research holds significant potential to advance the field of interpretable AI, particularly addressing the challenges posed by large-scale FMs. By providing a systematic framework for generating multi-level, faithful interpretations, this work can:

*   **Enhance Trust and Transparency:** Facilitate understanding of FM behavior, building trust among users and developers.
*   **Improve Debugging and Auditing:** Enable more effective identification of model failures, biases, and vulnerabilities through interpretable components.
*   **Support Regulatory Compliance:** Offer mechanisms that potentially align with requirements for algorithmic transparency and explanation (Task Description).
*   **Enable Safer Deployment:** Allow for more rigorous verification and validation of FMs, especially in critical applications.
*   **Advance Scientific Understanding:** Provide tools to probe the internal workings of FMs, contributing to the broader goal of mechanistic interpretability.
*   **Inform Future Design:** Insights gained could influence the design of future FMs that are more inherently interpretable from the outset.

Ultimately, this work aims to provide a practical and theoretically grounded approach to reconciling the power of FMs with the essential need for human understanding and oversight.

## **3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework**
The proposed MLKD-IFM framework operates on a pre-trained Foundation Model, $f_T$, which acts as the teacher. The framework aims to create a set of interpretable student components, $\{f_{S,i}\}$, each capturing different aspects of $f_T$'s behavior at various levels of abstraction. The key characteristic is the selective and multi-level nature of the distillation process. We do not aim to distill the *entire* FM into one interpretable model (which is likely infeasible without significant performance loss), but rather to create interpretable "views" or "modules" corresponding to specific parts or functionalities of $f_T$.

Let $x$ be an input to the FM, and $y = f_T(x)$ be its output. Let $z_l = f_{T,l}(x)$ denote the intermediate representation (activation) at layer or component $l$ of the teacher model. The framework involves identifying critical components $k \in K$ (where $K$ is a subset of all components/layers) based on an importance score $I(k)$, and then applying specific distillation techniques to these components.

**3.2 Component 1: Concept-Based Distillation**
*   **Goal:** To map intermediate representations $z_l$ from selected layers $l$ of the FM to a predefined set of human-understandable concepts $C = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_m\}$. This provides a high-level understanding of what features the FM internally represents.
*   **Method:** We will adapt and extend concept-based interpretation methods ([Martinez & Kim, 2023]). For a chosen layer $l$, we will train a lightweight student model, $f_{S,concept}(z_l; \theta_{concept})$, typically a linear model or a shallow MLP, to predict the presence or intensity of concepts $c_j$ based on the activation $z_l$. The concepts can be pre-defined based on domain knowledge or discovered from data (e.g., using clustering on activations followed by human labeling). The distillation involves training $f_{S,concept}$ to align with how concepts relate to teacher activations. This can be framed as learning a mapping $g: \mathcal{Z}_l \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ where $\mathcal{Z}_l$ is the activation space at layer $l$.
*   **Mathematical Formulation:** If concept labels $C(x)$ are available for input $x$, we can train the student predictor directly. More commonly, using KD, we might learn the student by mimicking a proxy "concept signal" derived from the teacher or by using methods like Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) where concept directions are identified in the activation space $Z_l$. The distillation loss could enforce alignment between the student's concept predictions and these directions or proxy signals. For instance, if we have concept direction vectors $v_{c_j}$ in the space $Z_l$, the student $f_{S,concept}$ could be trained to predict scores $s_j$ such that higher $s_j$ corresponds to $z_l$ being closer to the direction $v_{c_j}$.
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{concept} = \sum_{j=1}^m \mathbb{E}_{x \sim D} \left[ \ell(f_{S,concept}(f_{T,l}(x))_j, \text{proxy}_j(f_{T,l}(x))) \right] $$
    where $\ell$ is a suitable loss function (e.g., MSE, cosine similarity loss) and $\text{proxy}_j$ represents the target concept signal for concept $c_j$.

**3.3 Component 2: Decision Path Extraction**
*   **Goal:** To extract localized, simplified reasoning paths that explain how the FM arrives at a specific prediction $y$ for a given input $x$, particularly focusing on critical decision points.
*   **Method:** Drawing inspiration from techniques like [Zhang & Patel, 2023] and [Davis & Lee, 2023], we will apply KD to train inherently interpretable models, such as decision trees (e.g., CART, C4.5 variants) or rule lists (e.g., Bayesian Rule Lists, SkopeRules), to mimic the input-output behavior of a specific part of the FM, or the entire FM locally around input $x$. This distillation might focus on specific attention heads, feed-forward network blocks, or layer transitions identified as influential by the selective strategy (see 3.5).
*   **Mathematical Formulation:** The student model $f_{S,path}(x; \theta_{path})$ (e.g., a decision tree) is trained to match the teacher's output $f_T(x)$ or an intermediate reasoned output $f_{T, part}(x)$ for inputs $x$ within a specific region or fulfilling certain criteria.
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{path} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim D_{local}} \left[ \mathcal{L}_{task}(f_{S,path}(x; \theta_{path}), f_T(x)) \right] + \lambda \cdot \text{Complexity}(f_{S,path}) $$
    where $\mathcal{L}_{task}$ is the task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification) computed over a relevant local distribution $D_{local}$, and $\text{Complexity}$ is a regularization term penalizing tree depth or rule set size.

**3.4 Component 3: Neural-Symbolic Module Conversion**
*   **Goal:** To convert specific, functionally-coherent sub-modules within the FM (e.g., a block performing a logical-like operation identifiable via probing) into equivalent symbolic representations (e.g., first-order logic rules) ([Liu & Gonzalez, 2023]). This enables formal verification and deeper logical understanding of parts of the model.
*   **Method:** We will identify candidate neural modules $f_{T,module}$ based on their function or structure. Using KD, we will train a symbolic student model $f_{S,symbolic}(z_{in}; \theta_{symbolic})$—potentially using techniques from differentiable logic networks or symbolic regression—to replicate the input-output function of $f_{T,module}$, where $z_{in}$ is the input to the module.
*   **Mathematical Formulation:** The objective is functional equivalence distillation:
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{NeSy} = \mathbb{E}_{z_{in} \sim D_{module}} \left[ \mathcal{L}_{equiv}(f_{S,symbolic}(z_{in}; \theta_{symbolic}), f_{T,module}(z_{in})) \right] $$
    where $D_{module}$ represents the distribution of inputs the module typically receives, and $\mathcal{L}_{equiv}$ measures the discrepancy between the outputs of the symbolic student and the neural module (e.g., MSE for continuous outputs, cross-entropy for classifications).

**3.5 Selective Distillation Strategy**
*   **Goal:** To identify which parts (layers, attention heads, neurons, modules) of the FM $f_T$ are most critical for its predictions or specific behaviors and should be targeted for distillation. This avoids the prohibitive cost of distilling everything and focuses interpretability efforts where they matter most ([Brown & Nguyen, 2023]).
*   **Method:** We will leverage and compare various techniques for identifying component importance:
    *   *Attribution Methods:* Using gradient-based methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients, Grad-CAM) or perturbation-based methods to score the influence of internal components on the final output.
    *   *Influence Functions:* Estimating the impact of removing or modifying a component on task performance or specific predictions.
    *   *Task-Specific Probes:* Training simple probes on intermediate representations to see where task-relevant information resides.
    *   *Causal Tracing:* Methods that trace the flow of information causally through the network.
    We will define an importance score $I(k)$ for each component $k$. Distillation (using methods from 3.2, 3.3, 3.4) will be prioritized for components where $I(k)$ exceeds a threshold $\tau$, which can be adjusted based on the desired trade-off between interpretability coverage and computational cost.

**3.6 Integration and Presentation**
The distilled components ($f_{S,concept}$, $f_{S,path}$, $f_{S,symbolic}$) do not replace the original FM $f_T$. Instead, they serve as interpretable "lenses" or "modules" attached to $f_T$. The framework will provide interfaces to query these interpretations. For a given input $x$:
*   Concept activations can be visualized at key layers.
*   A localized decision path can be generated to explain the specific prediction $f_T(x)$.
*   The behavior of critical sub-modules can be described using the derived symbolic rules.
This multi-level output caters to different needs: concepts for high-level understanding, paths for specific decision tracing, and symbolic rules for deep, verifiable insights into component function.

**3.7 Data Collection and Foundation Models**
We will evaluate the MLKD-IFM framework on widely-used, pre-trained FMs:
*   **Language:** BERT (base/large), GPT-2/3 variants. Datasets: GLUE benchmark suite (for classification tasks like sentiment analysis, textual entailment), SQuAD (for question answering).
*   **Vision:** Vision Transformer (ViT). Datasets: ImageNet (image classification), potentially COCO (object detection, for interpreting localization).
If feasible, we will also explore application to a domain-specific FM, e.g., in healthcare using models trained on MIMIC-III/IV, to assess utility in a high-stakes context.

**3.8 Experimental Design**
1.  **Baseline Comparisons:** We will compare MLKD-IFM against:
    *   The original FM $f_T$ (performance upper bound, interpretability lower bound).
    *   Standard post-hoc explanation methods (LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients) applied to $f_T$. Assess faithfulness and usefulness qualitatively and quantitatively where possible.
    *   Existing single-level interpretable distillation methods (e.g., distilling into a single decision tree [Zhang & Patel, 2023], concept mapping alone [Martinez & Kim, 2023]).
    *   Inherently interpretable models trained from scratch on the task datasets (e.g., smaller decision trees, logistic regression), where applicable (performance lower bound).
2.  **Ablation Studies:** We will systematically evaluate the contribution of each component of MLKD-IFM:
    *   Framework without concept distillation.
    *   Framework without decision path distillation.
    *   Framework without neural-symbolic conversion.
    *   Framework using random selection vs. importance-based selective distillation.
3.  **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** We will analyze the impact of key hyperparameters, such as the selection threshold $\tau$, the complexity constraints on student models (e.g., tree depth), and the choice of importance measure $I(k)$.
4.  **User Studies:** To evaluate the practical utility and understandability of the generated interpretations, we will conduct small-scale user studies with participants representing different stakeholder groups (e.g., ML practitioners, domain experts, end-users depending on the task). Tasks might include identifying model errors, comparing model predictions, or making decisions based on model outputs with and without interpretations.

**3.9 Evaluation Metrics**
We will evaluate the framework along three primary axes, explicitly addressing the trade-offs identified in the literature ([Wilson & Park, 2023]):

1.  **Interpretability:**
    *   *Quantitative:* Complexity metrics (e.g., rule length, tree depth, number of concepts used), Concept Alignment Score (if ground truth concepts are known or approximated), Fidelity of paths/rules to local behavior.
    *   *Qualitative:* Human judgment scores from user studies on clarity, understandability, sufficiency, and usefulness of explanations for specific tasks (e.g., debugging, trust assessment). Faithfulness assessment through counterfactual analysis (does manipulating the explanation change the prediction accordingly?).
2.  **Fidelity:**
    *   *Prediction Agreement:* How often do the interpretable components (where applicable, e.g., decision paths) match the original FM's prediction on relevant data subsets? $$ \text{Fidelity} = \frac{1}{|D_{test}|} \sum_{x \in D_{test}} \mathbb{I}(f_{S,i}(x) \approx f_T(x)) $$
    *   *Functional Equivalence:* For distilled modules (neural-symbolic), measure the functional discrepancy (e.g., MSE, KL divergence) between the student $f_{S,symbolic}$ and teacher $f_{T,module}$ on representative inputs.
    *   *Global Impact:* Ensure the integration of interpretable modules does not significantly alter the global behavior of $f_T$ unless intended (e.g., for targeted bias correction).
3.  **Performance:**
    *   *Task Performance Preservation:* Measure the performance drop (e.g., accuracy, F1, BLEU) of the FM $f_T$ after potentially minor modifications needed to integrate or query the interpretable components, compared to the original $f_T$. We aim to minimize this drop: $\Delta P = P_{Original} - P_{Interpretable/Augmented}$.
    *   *Efficiency:* Computational overhead introduced by the distillation process and by generating interpretations at inference time.

The evaluation will focus on characterizing the Pareto frontier representing the trade-offs between these three dimensions.
