# A Multi-Level Knowledge Distillation Framework for Interpretable Foundation Models  

## Introduction  

### Background  
As foundation models become pivotal in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, their lack of transparency raises significant ethical and legal concerns. While large-scale models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their "black-box" nature complicates auditing and trust-building. Traditional interpretability methods—such as sparse linear models for tabular data or decision trees—lack scalability to handle foundation models, while post-hoc explanation techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME) often produce insufficient or unfaithful explanations. Mechanistic interpretability, which studies models through probing and activation analysis, offers partial solutions but struggles to provide holistic transparency. The urgent need for scalable interpretability has spurred interest in knowledge distillation, a process where a large "teacher" model trains a smaller "student" model while preserving performance.  

### Research Objectives  
This research proposes **InterpKD**, a systematic, multi-level knowledge distillation framework to construct interpretable foundation models without sacrificing performance. The objectives are:  
1. **Concept-based distillation**: Map latent representations of foundation models to human-understandable concepts (e.g., medical symptoms, material properties).  
2. **Decision path extraction**: Identify and formalize critical reasoning pathways (e.g., attention mechanisms) within the model.  
3. **Neural-symbolic integration**: Convert high-impact sub-networks into transparent rule-based systems while retaining connections to the larger architecture.  
4. **Dynamic module selection**: Prioritize distillation for model components with the highest decision-making impact.  

### Significance  
By creating "interpretability islands" embedded in complex models, InterpKD will:  
- Enable **trustworthy AI** in regulated domains via verifiable reasoning.  
- Reduce reliance on post-hoc explanations, which risk being unfaithful.  
- Allow **granular interpretability**: low-cost explanations for end-users (e.g., concept drift monitoring) and detailed reasoning for auditors.  
- Address key challenges in literature, including the interpretability-performance trade-off and scalable fidelity preservation.

## Methodology  

### Data Collection and Preprocessing  
- **Datasets**: Evaluate on benchmark datasets (e.g., MIMIC-III for healthcare), tabular data (e.g., FICO for credit scoring), and NLP tasks (e.g., biomedical QA).  
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenize text, normalize numerical features, and apply domain-specific transformations (e.g., clinical embeddings for medical data).  

### Multi-Level Knowledge Distillation Framework  

#### Architecture Overview  
The framework decouples a foundation model (e.g., BERT, GPT-3) into:  
1. **Concept Bottleneck Layer**: Maps latent representations to interpretable concepts $\mathcal{C} = \{c_1, c_2, \dots, c_K\}$.  
2. **Decision Module**: Extracts logical decision paths from attention weights or hidden states.  
3. **Symbolic Subnet**: Converts critical subgraphs into symbolic rules using propositional logic.  

#### Dynamic Component Identification  
To identify which parts of the teacher model require distillation:  
1. **Impact scoring**: Use SHAP or integrated gradients to compute feature importance metrics $\phi_i$ for each sub-layer.  
2. **Thresholding**: Select sub-networks with $|\phi_i| > \tau$, where $\tau$ is a domain-adjustable threshold.  

#### Component 1: Concept-Based Distillation  
Let $\mathbf{h}_T^{(l)}$ and $\mathbf{h}_S^{(l)}$ be the hidden states of the teacher (T) and student (S) at layer $l$. A bottleneck layer parameterized by $W_c$ projects $\mathbf{h}_S^{(l)}$ to a concept probability distribution $p(C|\mathbf{x})$:  
$$
L_{\text{concept}} = \mathcal{D}_{\text{KL}}\left[p_T(C|\mathbf{x}) \parallel p_S(C|\mathbf{x})\right] + \lambda_1 \|\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} p_S(C|\mathbf{x})\|
$$  
Here, $\mathcal{D}_{\text{KL}}$ aligns concept distributions between the teacher and student, while the gradient penalty ensures input perturbation robustness.  

#### Component 2: Decision Path Extraction  
Attention mechanisms in transformers provide decision pathways. For a transformer model, the attention weight matrix $A_i^{(l)}$ in layer $l$ is distilled as:  
$$
L_{\text{path}} = \sum_{i,j} \left( A_{i,j}^{T} - A_{i,j}^{S} \right)^2 + \lambda_2 \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \|\log A_i^{S}\|
$$  
This loss ensures alignment in attention patterns and penalizes sensitivity to input variations.  

#### Component 3: Neural-Symbolic Integration  
Convert high-impact subgraphs $g$ into symbolic rules $\mathcal{R} = \{\text{if } P \text{ then } Q\}$:  
1. Use Counterfactual Logit Pairing (CLP) to generate perturbations $\mathbf{x}'$ that flip the model's decision.  
2. Fit a decision set (sparse logical rules) via:  
$$
\min_{\mathcal{R}} \sum_{(\mathbf{x}, y)} \left[ \ell(\mathcal{M}(\mathbf{x}), y) + \gamma \cdot \Omega(\mathcal{R}) \right] \quad \text{s.t. } \mathcal{R} \text{ explains } \mathcal{M}(\mathbf{x})
$$  
Here, $\Omega$ controls rule complexity, and $\ell$ ensures fidelity to the teacher model $\mathcal{M}$.  

#### Training Protocol  
- **Distillation loss**: Combine losses with adaptive weights:  
$$
L = L_{\text{task}} + \alpha \cdot L_{\text{concept}} + \beta \cdot L_{\text{path}} + \gamma \cdot L_{\text{symbolic}}
$$  
- **Staged training**:  
  1. Pre-train concept and path modules on distilled data.  
  2. Fine-tune the full student network while freezing symbolic subnets.  

### Experimental Design  

#### Baselines  
Compare InterpKD against:  
- Post-hoc methods: LIME, SHAP.  
- Monolithic distillation: distilBERT, GAFT.  
- Hybrid approaches: TED [Liu et al., 2023].  

#### Metrics  
- **Performance**: Accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC.  
- **Interpretability** (adapted from [Zhang et al., 2023]):  
  - **Sparsity**: $\|\psi\|_0$ (number of non-zero explanation coefficients).  
  - **Fidelity**: $\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left|y_i - y_i^{\text{mask}}\right|$ (accuracy drop after masking key concepts).  
  - **Concept coverage**: Proportion of concepts $\mathcal{C}$ aligned with domain knowledge (e.g., clinical relevance from experts).  
- **Stability**: Standard deviation of interpretation consistency across random seeds.  

#### Evaluation Protocol  
- **In-silico testing**: Compare $L_{\text{concept}}$ against [Martínez et al., 2023] on synthetic datasets with known concepts.  
- **Real-world case studies**:  
  1. **Healthcare**: Validate medical concepts (e.g., "high LDL") and decision paths in ICU mortality prediction.  
  2. **Finance**: Trace credit scoring decisions to symbolic rules (e.g., "if Loan Term > 5 years ∧ Income < $40k, then Deny").  
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold on each dataset; metrics reported as mean ± std.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Outcomes  
1. **Framework**: InterpKD will be released as an open-source library with support for HuggingFace and ONNX models.  
2. **Benchmarking results**: Empirical demonstration that InterpKD achieves (i) >95% of teacher performance and (ii) 2× interpretable metrics (e.g., sparsity or fidelity) over baselines.  
3. **Theoretical insights**: Characterization of the performance-interpretability Pareto frontier for foundation models, extending [Wilson & Park, 2023].  

### Impact  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Enabling deployment in regulated industries by offering verifiable reasoning for specific decisions.  
- **Scientific Discovery**: The concept bottleneck layer could reveal hidden patterns (e.g., catalyst discovery in material science).  
- **Policy Influence**: Informing standards like the EU's AI Act, which mandates "sufficient" interpretability for high-risk AI.  

### Broader Implications  
This work bridges the gap between neural scalability and human oversight. By making foundation models locally transparent, it reduces dependence on fallible post-hoc methods—an urgent priority given recent black-box AI proliferation. Future directions include federated distillation for privacy-preserving interpretability and neuroscience-inspired symbolic abstraction.

This proposal directly addresses core questions from the workshop:  
- **Domain knowledge integration**: Concepts $\mathcal{C}$ can be curated by domain experts.  
- **Legal need**: InterpKD aligns with mandated interpretability in healthcare and finance.  
- **Limitations addressed**: Reducing the fidelity-interpretability trade-off by targeting critical components (see [Brown & Nguyen, 2023]).  

By systematically distilling interpretability into foundation models, this research advances the deployment of transparent AI in real-world scenarios.
