# Interpretable Foundation Models Through Knowledge Distillation

## Motivation
As foundation models grow in size and complexity, their "black box" nature becomes a significant barrier to understanding, trust, and regulatory compliance. Traditional interpretability approaches struggle with today's large-scale models, creating a critical gap between model sophistication and human understanding. This research addresses the challenge of interpretability in foundation models by proposing a systematic knowledge distillation framework that makes complex model behaviors more transparent without sacrificing performance.

## Main Idea
I propose a multi-level knowledge distillation framework that extracts interpretable representations from foundation models. The approach involves three key components: (1) Concept-based distillation that maps latent representations to human-understandable concepts; (2) Decision path extraction that identifies critical reasoning patterns in the model; and (3) Neural-symbolic integration that converts subsections of the foundation model into transparent rule-based structures. The methodology will identify which parts of foundation models require interpretability based on their decision impact, then selectively distill these components into interpretable modules while maintaining connections to the larger architecture. This targeted approach preserves performance while creating "interpretability islands" within complex models. The expected outcome is a framework that offers different levels of interpretability based on stakeholder needs, from high-level concept understanding for end-users to detailed decision paths for auditors and developers.
