**Title:** Geo-Cultural Probes: A Scalable Framework for Evaluating AI's Cultural Representation

**Motivation:** Assessing AI performance across diverse cultures is crucial for global inclusivity, yet current evaluations lack scalable, culturally-specific metrics. This research addresses the need for systematic methods to test AI models for cultural representation, bias, and alignment at scale.

**Main Idea:** We propose developing "Geo-Cultural Probes," a methodology using targeted prompts (text, image, or multimodal) designed to elicit culturally specific outputs from AI models. These probes will be systematically derived from cross-cultural psychology frameworks (e.g., Hofstede's dimensions) and localized expert knowledge, representing diverse cultural concepts, values, and scenarios. Model responses to these probes will be evaluated using a hybrid approach: automated metrics (e.g., semantic analysis for adherence to cultural norms, stereotype detection) and scalable human evaluation (e.g., micro-tasks assessing appropriateness, TURING test variations). This creates a quantifiable benchmark for cross-cultural performance, enabling developers to identify cultural gaps and biases, and iteratively improve model inclusivity before large-scale deployment.
