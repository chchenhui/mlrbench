**Title:** *Participatory Framework for Culturally-Representative Dataset Curation*  

**Motivation:**  
AI systems often perpetuate Western-centric biases due to homogenous training data, marginalizing non-Western cultures and amplifying inequities. Building inclusive AI requires datasets that authentically reflect diverse cultural contexts, yet current curation practices lack systematic methods to integrate local knowledge and ethical considerations. This gap risks reinforcing power imbalances and eroding cultural heritage.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a participatory framework that centers collaboration with local communities, anthropologists, and AI practitioners to co-create culturally representative datasets. The methodology involves:  
1. **Ethnographic Fieldwork**: Partnering with communities to document cultural practices, values, and expressions (e.g., oral traditions, art, rituals) through interviews, recordings, and participatory workshops.  
2. **Ethical Curation Guidelines**: Developing open-source protocols to address consent, data ownership, and bias mitigation, informed by decolonial theory and global ethical standards.  
3. **Hybrid Annotation**: Combining community-driven labeling with AI-assisted tools to preserve nuance (e.g., dialect-specific NLP models for low-resource languages).  
4. **Iterative Feedback Loops**: Validating dataset relevance and impact through community review and technical benchmarking across cultural contexts.  

Expected outcomes include open-access datasets, case studies on cultural preservation through AI, and policy recommendations for equitable data governance. This approach could enhance AI fairness in applications like education and healthcare while empowering marginalized communities to shape technological narratives. Impact will be measured via cultural inclusivity metrics, model performance across regions, and community-led evaluations.
