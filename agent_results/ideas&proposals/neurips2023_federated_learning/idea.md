**Title:** Federated Prompt Tuning for Efficient Adaptation of Foundation Models  

**Motivation:** Foundation models require significant computational resources for fine-tuning, especially in federated learning (FL) settings where data is decentralized and privacy-sensitive. Traditional FL fine-tuning approaches for large models incur high communication and computation costs, limiting scalability. Federated prompt tuning offers a lightweight alternative, but challenges like heterogeneous client data distributions and secure parameter aggregation remain unaddressed.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a framework for federated prompt tuning, where clients collaboratively adapt a shared foundation model by optimizing lightweight prompt parameters locally. Instead of transmitting full model updates, clients compute and share only prompt gradients or embeddings, reducing communication overhead. To address data heterogeneity, we introduce a dynamic prompt aggregation mechanism that weights contributions based on client data diversity and quality. Privacy is preserved via secure aggregation protocols and optional differential privacy noise. The methodology will benchmark prompt tuning techniques (e.g., prefix tuning, LoRA) in FL settings, evaluating communication efficiency, accuracy, and robustness across non-IID datasets. Expected outcomes include a resource-efficient FL framework that maintains model performance while minimizing client-side compute demands. The impact is enabling scalable, privacy-aware adaptation of foundation models for domains like healthcare and finance, where data cannot be centralized.
