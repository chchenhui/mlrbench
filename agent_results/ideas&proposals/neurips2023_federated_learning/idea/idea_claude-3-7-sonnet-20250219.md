# Prompt Tuning as a Lightweight Federated Learning Paradigm for Foundation Models

## Motivation
Foundation models like GPT require significant computational resources for traditional fine-tuning in federated settings. This creates a significant barrier for resource-constrained clients in federated learning environments. Additionally, full-model fine-tuning raises privacy concerns as it requires more comprehensive access to sensitive data. A more efficient approach is needed that maintains the quality of model adaptation while reducing computational overhead and preserving privacy in federated environments.

## Main Idea
This research proposes a federated prompt tuning (FedPT) framework specifically designed for foundation models. Instead of sharing model weights or gradients, clients would only learn and share optimized soft promptsâ€”small, continuous vectors that guide model behavior. The framework operates in three phases: (1) Local prompt tuning where each client optimizes a prompt on their local data, (2) Privacy-preserving prompt aggregation using differential privacy techniques to combine prompts without exposing sensitive information, and (3) Adaptive prompt ensemble that creates personalized prompt libraries for different client clusters. This approach reduces communication costs by 99% compared to traditional federated learning, enables participation of resource-constrained devices, and provides inherent privacy benefits by limiting what's shared across the network. FedPT would make foundation models more accessible in distributed, privacy-sensitive applications like healthcare and finance.
