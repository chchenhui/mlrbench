Title  
Federated Prompt Tuning for Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Adaptation of Foundation Models  

Introduction  
Background  
The advent of large-scale foundation models (e.g., GPT-3, BERT) has dramatically improved performance across natural language, vision, and multimodal tasks. However, fine-tuning these models typically requires centralizing vast amounts of sensitive data and considerable computational resources—both of which raise privacy, legal (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), and infrastructural concerns. Federated Learning (FL) addresses data-centralization issues by enabling model training across distributed clients without exposing raw data. Yet, standard FL approaches for foundation models impose prohibitive communication and computation costs, as full-model updates involve transmitting hundreds of millions to billions of parameters.  

Prompt tuning techniques (e.g., prefix tuning, LoRA) have emerged as a lightweight alternative: only a small set of prompt parameters are trained while the backbone model remains frozen. Integrating prompt tuning into FL can substantially reduce the communication/computation burden on clients. Preliminary works such as FedBPT (Sun et al., 2023) and FedDTPT (Wu et al., 2024) demonstrate the viability of federated prompt tuning, but challenges remain. In particular, data heterogeneity across clients can hinder convergence and degrade global performance; communication–computation trade-offs require principled balancing; and ensuring privacy through secure aggregation and differential privacy adds further complexity.  

Research Objectives  
1. Develop a federated prompt-tuning framework that optimizes only lightweight prompt parameters, thus minimizing communication and client computation.  
2. Introduce a dynamic, data-aware prompt aggregation mechanism that compensates for non-IID client data distributions.  
3. Integrate privacy guarantees via secure aggregation and differentially private noise addition.  
4. Empirically evaluate the proposed method’s accuracy, convergence speed, communication/computation costs, and privacy–utility trade-off on realistic non-IID benchmarks.  

Significance  
Achieving efficient, privacy-preserving adaptation of foundation models in federated settings will democratize their use in sensitive domains (e.g., healthcare, finance), where data centralization is prohibited. By focusing on prompt tuning, the proposed framework can enable resource-constrained clients to collaboratively benefit from foundation models without exposing their private data or requiring expensive hardware.  

Methodology  
Overview  
We propose FedePT (Federated Prompt Tuning), a framework in which each client maintains and updates only a low-dimensional prompt vector $P_k\in\mathbb{R}^d$, while the global foundation model parameters $\theta$ remain fixed. Clients alternate between local prompt optimization and secure, weighted aggregation of prompt updates. The core components are:  
• Local prompt optimization via gradient-based tuning (or gradient-free API calls).  
• Dynamic aggregation weights reflecting client data size and heterogeneity.  
• Secure aggregation and optional differential privacy.  
• Evaluation on multiple non-IID splits and downstream tasks.  

1. Data Collection and Partitioning  
We consider $K$ clients, each with private dataset $D_k=\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n_k}$. To reflect realistic heterogeneity, we simulate various non-IID scenarios on standard corpora, such as GLUE (for text classification), SQuAD (QA), and domain-specific health records (suitably anonymized), by employing:  
  a. Label skew: each $D_k$ contains a biased subset of labels.  
  b. Quantity skew: clients have differing $n_k$.  
  c. Feature skew: clients sample from distinct subpopulations (e.g., different writing styles).  

2. Prompt Tuning Mechanism  
We adopt a prefix-tuning style prompt. Let the foundation model be $f_\theta$ with frozen weights $\theta$. We prepend a continuous prompt $P_k\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times \ell}$ (length $\ell$, embedding dim $d$) to each input embedding sequence. The prompted model is  
$$
f_{\theta,P_k}(x)\;=\;f_\theta\big([\;P_k;\;E(x)\;]\big)\,,
$$  
where $E(x)$ is the embedding of $x$. Each client minimizes its local loss  
$$
\mathcal{L}_k(P_k)\;=\;\frac{1}{n_k}\sum_{(x,y)\in D_k}\ell\big(f_{\theta,P_k}(x),y\big)\,,
$$  
using standard optimizers (e.g., Adam).  

3. Federated Optimization with Dynamic Prompt Aggregation  
We run $T$ communication rounds. At round $t$, the server broadcasts the current global prompt $P^t$. Each client $k$ performs $E$ local epochs of prompt tuning:  
  a. Initialize $P_k^{t,0}=P^t$.  
  b. For $e=0\ldots E-1$, update:  
  $$
  P_k^{t,e+1}\;=\;P_k^{t,e}\;-\;\eta\,\nabla_{P}\,\mathcal{L}_k\big(P_k^{t,e}\big)\,.
  $$  
  c. Compute the prompt update $\Delta P_k^t = P_k^{t,E}-P^t$.  

Clients send $\Delta P_k^t$ (or its encrypted/DP-noised version) to the server. The server computes dynamic aggregation weights $w_k^t$ based on client data size and update divergence:  
$$
w_k^t \;=\; \frac{\lvert D_k\rvert}{\sum_j\lvert D_j\rvert}\;\cdot\;\exp\Big(-\gamma\;\big\lVert\Delta P_k^t-\overline{\Delta P}^t\big\rVert\Big)\,,
$$  
where $\overline{\Delta P}^t=\frac{1}{K}\sum_j\Delta P_j^t$, and $\gamma>0$ controls sensitivity to heterogeneity. Finally, the server updates:  
$$
P^{t+1} \;=\; P^t \;+\;\frac{\sum_{k=1}^K w_k^t\,\Delta P_k^t}{\sum_{k=1}^K w_k^t}\,.
$$  

4. Privacy and Security  
To preserve client privacy:  
• Secure Aggregation: Clients encrypt $\Delta P_k^t$ via additive secret sharing so the server only recovers the sum.  
• Differential Privacy (optional): Each client clips $\Delta P_k^t$ to norm $C$ and adds Gaussian noise:  
$$
\widetilde{\Delta P}_k^t = \mathrm{clip}\big(\Delta P_k^t,\,C\big)\;+\;\mathcal{N}\big(0,\,\sigma^2C^2I\big),
$$  
which yields an $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee after $T$ rounds.  

5. Algorithm Summary (Pseudocode)  
```
Input: Pretrained model f_θ, init prompt P^0, clients {D_k}, rounds T, local epochs E
For t=0 to T−1 do
  Server → broadcast P^t
  For each client k in parallel:
    P_k ← P^t
    For e=1 to E do
      P_k ← P_k − η ∇_P ℒ_k(P_k)
    ΔP_k ← P_k − P^t
    Clip & add DP noise to ΔP_k if enabled
    Securely send ΔP_k to server
  Server:
    Compute per-client weights w_k^t
    Aggregate: P^{t+1} ← P^t + (∑_k w_k^t ΔP_k) / (∑_k w_k^t)
Return final prompt P^T

Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate that FedePT will:  
• Achieve comparable downstream performance to centralized prompt tuning while transmitting only $\mathcal{O}(d\ell)$ parameters per round—orders of magnitude less than full-model FL.  
• Converge within fewer communication rounds than uniform prompt aggregation, thanks to dynamic heterogeneity‐aware weighting.  
• Retain strong privacy guarantees under $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP with minimal utility loss.  
• Operate within the computational budgets of resource-constrained clients (e.g., edge devices, mobile phones).  

Impact  
By demonstrating that foundation models can be effectively adapted in federated, privacy-preserving settings via prompt tuning, this research will:  
• Lower barriers to deploying large ML models in domains where data centralization is infeasible.  
• Inform best practices for balancing efficiency, performance, and privacy in distributed adaptation of foundation models.  
• Serve as a foundation for future extensions, such as personalized prompt clusters, multi-stage pretraining + prompt finetuning, and cross‐modal federated adaptation.  

In sum, FedePT promises to unlock scalable, secure, and efficient collaboration around foundation models, bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI capabilities and real-world privacy and resource constraints.
