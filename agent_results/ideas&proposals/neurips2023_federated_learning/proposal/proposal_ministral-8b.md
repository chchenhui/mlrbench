# Federated Prompt Tuning for Efficient Adaptation of Foundation Models

## Introduction

Foundation models, such as ChatGPT, have transformed the landscape of machine learning by demonstrating impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, training these models requires vast amounts of data and computational resources, which can be a bottleneck, especially in federated learning (FL) settings where data is decentralized and privacy-sensitive. Federated learning offers a promising solution by training models collaboratively across decentralized devices or data silos while keeping the data securely on those devices or within specific organizations. This research aims to address the challenges of fine-tuning foundation models in FL by proposing a framework for federated prompt tuning.

### Research Objectives

1. **Efficiency**: Reduce communication and computational overhead by optimizing lightweight prompt parameters locally and sharing only prompt gradients or embeddings.
2. **Heterogeneity**: Address data heterogeneity by introducing a dynamic prompt aggregation mechanism that weights contributions based on client data diversity and quality.
3. **Privacy**: Preserve privacy using secure aggregation protocols and optional differential privacy noise.
4. **Scalability**: Benchmark prompt tuning techniques and evaluate communication efficiency, accuracy, and robustness across non-IID datasets to ensure the framework is scalable and maintains model performance.

### Significance

The proposed framework has significant implications for enabling scalable, privacy-aware adaptation of foundation models in domains like healthcare and finance, where data cannot be centralized. By reducing the computational burden on clients and ensuring privacy, this research can democratize the development of high-quality machine learning models, making them accessible to a broader community.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed methodology involves a federated prompt tuning framework that optimizes lightweight prompt parameters locally and collaboratively adapts a shared foundation model. The framework consists of the following key components:

1. **Initialization**: Clients receive a pre-trained foundation model and a set of initial prompt parameters.
2. **Local Optimization**: Clients optimize the prompt parameters locally using their data, employing gradient-based or gradient-free optimization methods.
3. **Secure Aggregation**: Clients transmit prompt gradients or embeddings to a central server, which aggregates these updates using secure aggregation protocols.
4. **Global Update**: The server aggregates the received updates and broadcasts the updated prompt parameters back to the clients.
5. **Iteration**: Steps 2-4 are repeated for a predefined number of iterations or until convergence.

### Algorithmic Steps

The algorithmic steps for the federated prompt tuning framework are as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each client \( c \in \mathcal{C} \):
     - Initialize the foundation model \( M \).
     - Initialize the prompt parameters \( \theta_c \).
     - Split the data \( D_c \) into training and validation sets.

2. **Local Optimization**:
   - For each client \( c \in \mathcal{C} \):
     - For each epoch \( t \):
       - Compute the loss \( L_c(\theta_c) \) on the training data.
       - Update the prompt parameters \( \theta_c \) using gradient descent or gradient-free optimization methods.
       - Compute the validation loss \( L_{val,c}(\theta_c) \) on the validation data.

3. **Secure Aggregation**:
   - For each client \( c \in \mathcal{C} \):
     - Compute the gradient \( \nabla_{\theta_c} L_c(\theta_c) \) or the embedding \( E_c \) of the prompt parameters \( \theta_c \).
     - Transmit the gradient or embedding to the server.

4. **Global Update**:
   - At the server:
     - Aggregate the received gradients or embeddings using a secure aggregation protocol, such as Secure Aggregation (SA) or Differentially Private Aggregation (DPA).
     - Compute the global update \( \theta \) as:
       \[
       \theta = \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}} \frac{w_c \cdot \nabla_{\theta_c} L_c(\theta_c)}{\sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}} w_c}
       \]
       where \( w_c \) is a weight assigned to client \( c \) based on data diversity and quality.
     - Broadcast the updated prompt parameters \( \theta \) to all clients.

5. **Iteration**:
   - Repeat steps 2-4 for a predefined number of iterations or until convergence.

### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the proposed framework will be evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Communication Efficiency**: Measured by the total amount of data transmitted between clients and the server.
2. **Accuracy**: Evaluated on a held-out test set using standard metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, or AUC-ROC.
3. **Robustness**: Assessed by evaluating the framework's performance across non-IID datasets and comparing it to baseline methods.
4. **Scalability**: Measured by the framework's ability to handle a large number of clients and maintain performance.

### Experimental Design

To validate the proposed framework, experiments will be conducted using the following setup:

1. **Datasets**: Non-IID datasets from the CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and NLP domains.
2. **Clients**: Simulated clients with varying data distributions and computational resources.
3. **Foundation Model**: A large pre-trained language model, such as BERT or T5.
4. **Prompt Tuning Techniques**: Benchmarked techniques, such as prefix tuning, LoRA, and FedBPT.
5. **Baseline Methods**: Traditional FL fine-tuning methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx.

The experiments will be conducted using the following protocol:

1. **Data Preparation**: Split the datasets into non-IID distributions and assign them to simulated clients.
2. **Model Initialization**: Initialize the foundation model and prompt parameters on each client.
3. **Local Training**: Run the local optimization steps for a fixed number of epochs.
4. **Secure Aggregation**: Aggregate the prompt gradients or embeddings using the proposed method.
5. **Global Update**: Broadcast the updated prompt parameters to all clients.
6. **Iteration**: Repeat steps 3-5 for a predefined number of iterations or until convergence.
7. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the framework's performance using the predefined metrics.
