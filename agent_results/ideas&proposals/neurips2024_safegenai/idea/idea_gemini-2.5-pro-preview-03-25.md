**Title:** Proactive Debiasing for Safe Generative AI in Scientific Discovery

**Motivation:** Generative models accelerate scientific discovery but risk perpetuating or amplifying existing biases present in scientific literature and data (e.g., focusing on studied populations, established theories). This can lead to inequitable research outcomes and stifle innovation by neglecting under-explored areas or hypotheses. Proactive debiasing is crucial for ensuring fairness and robustness in AI-driven science.

**Main Idea:** Develop a framework for identifying and mitigating potential biases *before* they significantly skew the outputs of generative models used in scientific hypothesis generation or experimental design. The approach involves: (1) Using causal inference techniques on knowledge graphs derived from scientific literature to detect potential biasing factors (e.g., funding sources, geographical origins, historical trends). (2) Implementing counterfactually-aware fine-tuning or prompting strategies that explicitly encourage the model to explore less-represented research avenues or consider alternative theoretical frameworks. (3) Evaluating the effectiveness using novel metrics that measure the diversity and novelty of generated scientific outputs, alongside traditional fairness metrics. Expected outcomes include generative models that produce more equitable, diverse, and potentially groundbreaking scientific suggestions.
