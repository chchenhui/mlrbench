**Key Challenges:**

1. **Extension to High-Dimensional Generative Models**: Applying randomized smoothing to complex, high-dimensional generative models like diffusion models and large language models poses significant computational and theoretical challenges.

2. **Balancing Robustness and Generation Quality**: Introducing noise to achieve robustness can degrade the quality of generated outputs, necessitating strategies to maintain high fidelity while ensuring robustness.

3. **Adaptive Noise Calibration**: Determining optimal noise levels for different inputs and models is complex, requiring adaptive methods to calibrate noise without compromising performance.

4. **Computational Overhead**: The process of generating multiple noisy samples and aggregating outputs increases computational demands, which can be prohibitive for large-scale models.

5. **Theoretical Guarantees in Generative Contexts**: Deriving robust theoretical guarantees, such as bounding the Wasserstein shift in output distributions under perturbations, is more intricate for generative models compared to classifiers.
