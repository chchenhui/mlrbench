# SmoothGen: Certified Robustness via Randomized Smoothing for Conditional Generative Models

## 1. Introduction

Generative AI models, particularly conditional generative models like text-to-image diffusion systems and large language models (LLMs), have revolutionized numerous applications across scientific research and commercial domains. These models can generate realistic images from text descriptions, translate languages, compose code, and even assist in medical diagnosis. However, alongside their remarkable capabilities, these models present significant safety concerns.

One critical safety issue is the vulnerability of conditional generative models to adversarial attacks. Recent research has shown that minor, often imperceptible modifications to input conditions (e.g., subtle changes to text prompts or image seeds) can drastically alter the generated outputs, potentially yielding harmful, biased, or misleading content. For instance, an adversarially perturbed prompt to a medical image generation system might produce a falsified diagnostic image, or a slightly modified input to a legal document generator could introduce dangerous loopholes. These vulnerabilities severely limit the trustworthiness of generative AI in high-stakes applications where reliability is paramount.

Despite the extensive research on adversarial robustness for classification models, the field of certified robustness for generative models remains relatively unexplored. While empirical defense mechanisms exist, they typically lack theoretical guarantees and can be circumvented by adaptive attacks. Providing provable robustness certificates for generative models is substantially more challenging due to their high-dimensional output spaces and the complex relationship between inputs and outputs.

This research aims to address this critical gap by developing SmoothGen, a novel framework that extends randomized smoothing—a technique that has shown success in providing certified robustness for classifiers—to conditional generative models. SmoothGen offers theoretical robustness guarantees while preserving the quality and utility of generated content. The key research objectives include:

1. Developing a mathematical framework for applying randomized smoothing to conditional generative models, providing certified robustness against bounded adversarial perturbations.
2. Designing adaptive noise schedules and gradient-based noise calibration techniques that maintain generation quality while ensuring robustness.
3. Deriving theoretical certificates that bound the Wasserstein shift in output distributions under adversarial perturbations.
4. Empirically validating the effectiveness of SmoothGen across multiple generative architectures, including diffusion models and autoregressive models.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to substantially improve the safety and reliability of generative AI systems. By providing mathematical guarantees of robustness, SmoothGen enables the deployment of these powerful technologies in sensitive domains with greater confidence, reducing the risks of malicious exploitation and unintended harmful outputs. This work represents a fundamental step toward responsible AI development, aligning with the broader goal of ensuring that advanced AI systems remain beneficial and safe for society.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Preliminaries and Problem Formulation

Let $G: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ be a conditional generative model that maps input conditions $x \in \mathcal{X}$ (e.g., text prompts, image seeds) to output distributions over $\mathcal{Y}$ (e.g., images, text). For deterministic generators, we denote the output as $y = G(x)$. For stochastic generators, we denote a sample from the output distribution as $y \sim G(x)$.

We aim to defend against adversarial perturbations $\delta$ such that $\|\delta\|_p \leq \epsilon$ for some norm $p$ and perturbation budget $\epsilon$. The adversary's goal is to find a perturbation that maximizes some distance metric between the original and perturbed outputs:

$$\max_{\|\delta\|_p \leq \epsilon} d(G(x), G(x + \delta))$$

where $d$ is an appropriate distance metric for the output space $\mathcal{Y}$. For distributions, we use the Wasserstein distance $W_2$.

### 2.2 SmoothGen Framework

The core of our proposed framework, SmoothGen, is the extension of randomized smoothing to conditional generative models. We define a smoothed generator $\hat{G}$ as follows:

$$\hat{G}(x) = \mathbb{E}_{\eta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)}[G(x + \eta)]$$

For stochastic generators, this represents an expectation over both the noise distribution and the generator's internal randomness.

In practice, we approximate this expectation by sampling $n$ noise vectors $\{\eta_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and aggregating the corresponding outputs:

$$\hat{G}(x) \approx \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n G(x + \eta_i)$$

The aggregation method depends on the output type:
- For image generation: pixel-wise averaging or optimal transport-based blending
- For text generation: token probability averaging, nucleus sampling, or majority voting

### 2.3 Theoretical Robustness Certificates

We derive the following theoretical guarantee for our smoothed generator:

**Theorem 1**: *Let $G: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ be a conditional generative model and $\hat{G}$ be the smoothed generator with Gaussian noise $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$. For any input $x$ and perturbation $\delta$ with $\|\delta\|_2 \leq \epsilon$, the Wasserstein-2 distance between the output distributions satisfies:*

$$W_2(\hat{G}(x), \hat{G}(x + \delta)) \leq K \cdot \epsilon$$

*where $K$ is a constant that depends on the noise parameter $\sigma$ and the Lipschitz constant of $G$.*

For deterministic generators, we can derive a tighter bound:

**Theorem 2**: *For a deterministic generator $G$ and smoothed generator $\hat{G}$ with Gaussian noise $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$, if $\|\delta\|_2 \leq \epsilon$, then:*

$$\|\hat{G}(x) - \hat{G}(x + \delta)\|_2 \leq \frac{\epsilon}{\sigma} \cdot L_G$$

*where $L_G$ is the Lipschitz constant of $G$.*

These theoretical certificates provide provable guarantees on the maximum possible change in the output distribution (or deterministic output) when the input is adversarially perturbed within a bounded region.

### 2.4 Adaptive Noise Calibration

A key challenge in applying randomized smoothing to generative models is balancing robustness (which improves with higher noise levels) with generation quality (which degrades with higher noise). We propose two novel techniques to address this:

#### 2.4.1 Adaptive Noise Scheduling

Instead of using a fixed noise level $\sigma$ for all inputs, we adapt the noise level based on input characteristics:

$$\sigma(x) = \sigma_{\text{base}} \cdot f(x)$$

where $f(x)$ is a sensitivity function that estimates the vulnerability of input $x$ to adversarial perturbations. We model $f(x)$ using a neural network trained on a dataset of inputs with known sensitivities, measuring the Lipschitz constants of $G$ in the neighborhood of each input.

#### 2.4.2 Gradient-Based Noise Calibration

We propose a gradient-based method to calibrate noise levels in latent space. For embedding-based models (e.g., those that encode prompts into a latent space before generation), we apply noise in the latent space rather than the input space:

$$\hat{G}(x) = \mathbb{E}_{\eta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma(E(x)))}[G(E(x) + \eta)]$$

where $E$ is the encoder function and $\Sigma(E(x))$ is a covariance matrix adapted to the specific latent representation. We compute this covariance matrix using the gradient information:

$$\Sigma(E(x)) = \lambda \cdot \left(J_G(E(x))^T J_G(E(x)) + \alpha I\right)^{-1}$$

where $J_G$ is the Jacobian of $G$ with respect to the latent representation, $\lambda$ is a scaling factor, and $\alpha$ is a regularization parameter.

### 2.5 Implementation for Different Generative Architectures

#### 2.5.1 Diffusion Models

For text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), we apply randomized smoothing at the text embedding level:

1. Encode the text prompt $x$ into embedding $e = E(x)$
2. Sample $n$ noise vectors $\{\eta_i\}_{i=1}^n$ from $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$
3. Generate images from each noisy embedding: $y_i = G(e + \eta_i)$
4. Aggregate results using optimal transport blending to preserve image coherence

#### 2.5.2 Autoregressive Language Models

For language models that generate text token-by-token, we apply smoothing at each generation step:

1. For each generation step $t$:
   a. Sample $n$ noise vectors $\{\eta_i\}_{i=1}^n$
   b. Compute token probabilities for each noisy prompt embedding
   c. Average the token probability distributions
   d. Sample the next token from the averaged distribution

### 2.6 Experimental Design

We will evaluate SmoothGen on three types of generative models:

1. **Text-to-Image Diffusion Models**: Stable Diffusion v1.5 and DALL-E 2

3. **Conditional GANs**: StyleGAN2 and BigGAN

#### 2.6.1 Datasets

- For language models: WebText, C4, and domain-specific datasets (medical, legal)
- For conditional GANs: ImageNet, CelebA-HQ

#### 2.6.2 Attack Scenarios

We will evaluate robustness against:

1. **White-box gradient-based attacks**: Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) with various norms ($\ell_2$, $\ell_\infty$)
2. **Black-box query-based attacks**: Natural Evolution Strategies (NES), Random Search
3. **Semantic attacks**: Word substitutions, synonym replacements, and paraphrasing

#### 2.6.3 Evaluation Metrics

We will measure both robustness and generation quality:

**Robustness Metrics**:
- Certified radius (the maximum perturbation radius for which we can guarantee robustness)
- Empirical robustness against adaptive attacks
- Average Wasserstein distance between original and adversarially perturbed outputs

**Quality Metrics**:
- For images: FID, CLIP score, user study ratings
- For text: BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, human evaluation
- Task-specific metrics for domain applications (e.g., diagnostic accuracy for medical images)

#### 2.6.4 Computational Analysis

We will analyze the computational overhead of SmoothGen compared to the base generators, measuring:
- Inference time increase as a function of noise samples $n$
- Memory requirements
- Potential for optimization and parallelization

### 2.7 Implementation Details
