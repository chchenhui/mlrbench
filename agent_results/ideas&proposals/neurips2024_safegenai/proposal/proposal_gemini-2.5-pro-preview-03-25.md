**1. Title:** SmoothGen: Certified Robustness via Randomized Smoothing for Conditional Generative Models

**2. Introduction**

**2.1. Background**
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), encompassing large language models (LLMs), vision-language models, and diffusion models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities, transforming fields from scientific discovery (Assuncao et al., 2019) to commercial applications and daily life (Brown et al., 2020; Rombach et al., 2022). These models excel at tasks like generating creative text, synthesizing realistic images from descriptions, aiding in hypothesis formulation, and organizing complex data. However, their rapid proliferation and increasing sophistication raise significant safety concerns, forming the central theme of the Safe Generative AI Workshop. Key risks include the potential generation of harmful, biased, or misleading content, vulnerability to adversarial manipulation, privacy breaches, and the erosion of trust due to overconfidence in model outputs (Bender et al., 2021; Weidinger et al., 2021).

Conditional generative models, which produce outputs based on specific inputs (e.g., text prompts, seed images, structured data), are particularly susceptible to subtle, often imperceptible, adversarial perturbations in their conditioning information. A small modification to a text prompt could cause an LLM to generate toxic or factually incorrect text, or guide a text-to-image model to produce inappropriate or harmful imagery. This vulnerability stems from the high-dimensional, non-linear nature of these models' input-output mappings. While empirical defenses like adversarial training exist, they often lack formal guarantees and can be circumvented by adaptive attacks (Tramer et al., 2020). Addressing this vulnerability with *provable* robustness guarantees is crucial for deploying generative AI safely and responsibly, especially in high-stakes domains such as medical image generation, legal document drafting, or educational content creation.

Randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019) has emerged as a powerful and scalable technique for providing *certified* robustness guarantees for classifiers. It involves creating a new, "smoothed" classifier by aggregating the predictions of the base classifier on multiple noisy versions of an input. This process provably confers robustness against adversarial perturbations, typically bounded under the $L_2$ norm. While extensions have been explored for different noise distributions (Cohen et al., 2020), semantic transformations (Hao et al., 2022), and even specific generative models like conditional GANs (Zhang et al., 2021) and RNNs (Zhang et al., 2021), a general and theoretically grounded framework for certifying the robustness of modern, high-dimensional conditional generative models like diffusion models and large autoregressive language models remains largely unexplored. These models present unique challenges due to their complex output spaces (high-resolution images, coherent long-form text) and the critical need to balance robustness with generative quality (fidelity, coherence, creativity). Lipschitz continuity approaches (Zhang et al., 2020) offer an alternative but often yield looser bounds or require modifying the model architecture.

**2.2. Research Objectives**
This research proposes **SmoothGen**, a novel framework to extend randomized smoothing to general conditional generative models, providing certified robustness against adversarial perturbations in the conditioning input. Our primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop the SmoothGen Framework:** Formulate a theoretically sound randomized smoothing procedure applicable to diverse conditional generative models (e.g., text-to-image diffusion models, LLMs) operating on conditioning inputs $x$ (e.g., text embeddings, image embeddings). This involves defining appropriate noise distributions in the model's latent or embedding space and designing effective aggregation mechanisms for the generated outputs or their underlying distributions.
2.  **Derive Theoretical Robustness Certificates:** Establish rigorous mathematical proofs that provide certified bounds on the change in the *output distribution* of the smoothed generator under bounded perturbations of the conditioning input $x$. Specifically, we aim to bound the Wasserstein distance between the output distributions corresponding to the original and perturbed conditions, $W_p(\tilde{G}(\cdot|x), \tilde{G}(\cdot|x+\delta))$, where $\tilde{G}$ is the smoothed generator and $\delta$ is the perturbation.
3.  **Optimize Robustness-Fidelity Trade-off:** Investigate and develop techniques to mitigate the potential degradation of generation quality introduced by the smoothing noise. This includes exploring adaptive noise scheduling (varying noise levels based on input or generation stage) and gradient-based noise calibration methods within the latent space to maximize the certified radius while preserving perceptual fidelity and semantic coherence.
4.  **Empirical Validation:** Implement and evaluate SmoothGen on state-of-the-art conditional generative models, including a representative diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) for text-to-image generation and a large language model (e.g., Llama 2 or a GPT variant) for text generation. Assess certified robustness radii, empirical robustness against known attack strategies, and impact on generation quality using standard metrics and human evaluation.
5.  **Comparative Analysis:** Compare the performance (robustness guarantees, fidelity, computational overhead) of SmoothGen against the baseline (unsmoothed) models and potentially other relevant defense strategies, such as adversarial training applied to the conditioning pathway or existing smoothing techniques adapted from simpler models.

**2.3. Significance**
This research directly addresses critical AI safety concerns highlighted by the workshop, particularly the vulnerability of generative models to manipulation and the generation of harmful content. SmoothGen aims to provide the *first* general framework for *verifiable* adversarial robustness in high-dimensional conditional generative models. Successful development will significantly enhance the trustworthiness and safety of deploying these powerful AI systems in sensitive real-world applications. By providing provable guarantees, rather than just empirical defenses, SmoothGen offers a more reliable foundation for safety assessments. Furthermore, this work will advance the theoretical understanding of robustness in the context of generative processes, potentially opening new research avenues in certified AI safety. The findings and open-source implementation will be valuable resources for researchers and practitioners working towards building safer and more reliable generative AI.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1. Research Design Overview**
This research follows a constructive and empirical methodology. We will first mathematically formalize the SmoothGen framework, extending randomized smoothing theory to conditional generative settings. Then, we will develop algorithmic implementations for specific model architectures (diffusion, LLMs). Key innovations will focus on noise application in latent spaces and optimizing the robustness-fidelity balance. Finally, we will conduct extensive experiments to validate the theoretical certificates, measure empirical robustness, assess generation quality, and analyze computational costs.

**3.2. Mathematical Formulation**
Let $G(y | x)$ denote the base conditional generative model, which maps a conditioning input $x \in \mathcal{X}$ to a distribution over outputs $y \in \mathcal{Y}$. The input $x$ could be a text prompt, an image, or other conditioning information. In practice, $x$ is often first mapped to an embedding $e = \phi(x) \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Our focus is on robustness against perturbations $\delta$ applied to this embedding $e$.

*   **Smoothing Distribution:** We introduce noise $\eta$ drawn from a suitable distribution, typically an isotropic Gaussian distribution $\eta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I_d)$, where $I_d$ is the identity matrix in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\sigma$ is the noise standard deviation. The noise is added to the embedding $e$.
*   **Smoothed Generator:** The smoothed generator $\tilde{G}$ is defined conceptually by the expected output distribution when the input embedding is perturbed by the smoothing noise:
    $$ \tilde{G}(\cdot | x) = \mathbb{E}_{\eta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I_d)} [G(\cdot | \phi^{-1}(e+\eta))] $$
    where $e = \phi(x)$. In practice, generating a sample $y$ from $\tilde{G}(\cdot | x)$ involves:
    1.  Compute the embedding $e = \phi(x)$.
    2.  Sample noise $\eta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I_d)$.
    3.  Generate an output sample $y \sim G(\cdot | \phi^{-1}(e+\eta))$.
    However, for certification and analysis, we consider the *distribution* itself. Often, evaluating $\tilde{G}$ involves Monte Carlo estimation: drawing $N$ noise samples $\eta_1, ..., \eta_N$, generating corresponding output samples $y_1, ..., y_N$, and potentially aggregating them (e.g., averaging pixel values for images, though this is a simplification) or treating the ensemble $\{y_i\}$ as representing the smoothed output distribution.

*   **Robustness Certificate:** Following the logic of Cohen et al. (2019), we aim to certify the robustness of $\tilde{G}$ against adversarial perturbations $\delta$ applied to the embedding $e$, such that $\| \delta \|_2 \leq \epsilon$. The core idea is that if a property holds for the majority of outputs generated from the noisy ensemble around $e$, it is likely to hold for the majority of outputs generated from the noisy ensemble around $e+\delta$, provided $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small relative to $\sigma$.

    Instead of certifying a single class prediction, we aim to bound the difference between the *output distributions* induced by $x$ and $x'$ (where $e' = \phi(x')$ and $\|e - e'\|_2 \leq \epsilon$). A natural measure for comparing probability distributions is the Wasserstein distance. We hypothesize and aim to prove a certificate of the form:
    $$ W_p(\tilde{G}(\cdot|x), \tilde{G}(\cdot|x')) \leq f(\epsilon, \sigma, p) $$
    where $W_p$ is the p-Wasserstein distance, and $f$ is a function that decreases as $\sigma$ increases and increases as $\epsilon$ increases. The derivation will likely involve analyzing how the overlap between the smoothing distributions $\mathcal{N}(e, \sigma^2 I_d)$ and $\mathcal{N}(e', \sigma^2 I_d)$ relates to the distance between the expected output distributions, potentially leveraging concentration inequalities and properties of the base generator $G$. The specific form of $f$ will depend on assumptions about $G$ and the choice of $p$.

**3.3. Algorithmic Steps (SmoothGen Inference)**
To generate an output $y$ from the smoothed generator $\tilde{G}$ given input $x$ and noise level $\sigma$:

1.  **Encoding:** Obtain the conditioning embedding $e = \phi(x)$.
2.  **Noise Sampling:** Draw $N$ noise samples $\eta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I_d)$ for $i=1, \dots, N$.
3.  **Parallel Generation:** For each $i$, compute the perturbed embedding $e_i = e + \eta_i$. Generate an output sample $y_i$ using the base generator $G$ conditioned on $e_i$. Depending on the model, this involves running the diffusion process or autoregressive generation: $y_i \sim G(\cdot | \phi^{-1}(e_i))$.
4.  **Aggregation/Selection:** Combine the samples $\{y_1, ..., y_N\}$ to produce the final output $y$. The aggregation strategy is crucial and model-dependent:
    *   **For Images (Diffusion):** Could compute the mean image $\bar{y} = \frac{1}{N} \sum y_i$ (if meaningful), select the sample $y_k$ corresponding to the most "typical" noise $\eta_k$ (e.g., smallest $\|\eta_k\|_2$), or select the sample whose generation aligns best with some quality/consistency metric across the ensemble.
    *   **For Text (LLMs):** Could use majority voting at the token level (difficult for diverse outputs), sample from an aggregated probability distribution over the next token (if accessible), or select the most probable/coherent full sequence among the $N$ generated options based on perplexity or other scoring methods. We will investigate selecting the output corresponding to the median or mode of the noisy samples in some abstract sense.
    The choice of $N$ impacts computational cost and the accuracy of approximating the true smoothed distribution $\tilde{G}$.

**3.4. Key Innovations for Generative Models**

*   **Noise Injection Location:** Applying noise directly to raw inputs (text, pixels) can be less effective or meaningful than applying it in a learned embedding space (e.g., CLIP text/image embeddings for diffusion, final layer hidden states or specific attention layer inputs for LLMs). We will investigate the optimal injection points.
*   **Adaptive Noise Schedules ($\sigma$):** A fixed $\sigma$ might be suboptimal. We propose exploring adaptive strategies:
    *   Input-dependent $\sigma$: Use a small network to predict an appropriate $\sigma$ based on characteristics of the input $x$.
    *   Layer-dependent $\sigma$ (if applicable): For models with deep architectures, apply noise with varying $\sigma$ at different layers/stages.
    *   Annealed $\sigma$: Gradually reduce $\sigma$ during the generative process (e.g., diffusion timesteps) if it improves fidelity.
*   **Gradient-Based Noise Calibration:** To explicitly balance robustness and fidelity, we propose formulating an optimization objective. Let $\mathcal{R}(\sigma)$ be the certified radius achieved with noise $\sigma$, and $\mathcal{F}(\sigma)$ be a measure of fidelity (e.g., negative FID for images, negative perplexity for text) of samples generated using $\tilde{G}$ with noise $\sigma$. We aim to find $\sigma$ that maximizes a combined objective, potentially $ \mathcal{R}(\sigma) - \lambda \cdot \max(0, \mathcal{F}_{target} - \mathcal{F}(\sigma)) $, where $\lambda$ balances the terms and $\mathcal{F}_{target}$ is a desired fidelity level. This optimization could potentially be performed per-input or amortized using gradients through the sampling process (if differentiable approximations like Gumbel-Softmax are used, or via policy gradient methods).

**3.5. Experimental Design**

*   **Models:**
    *   **Text-to-Image:** Stable Diffusion (e.g., v1.5 or SDXL). Conditioning input $x$ is the text prompt, embedding $e$ is the CLIP text embedding.
    *   **Language Generation:** Llama 2 (e.g., 7B or 13B chat variant) or similar instruction-tuned LLM. Conditioning input $x$ is the instruction prompt, embedding $e$ could be the final hidden states of the prompt tokens.
*   **Datasets:**
    *   **Text-to-Image:** MS-COCO captions, DrawBench prompts, PartiPrompts. Focus on prompts susceptible to generating harmful content or where subtle changes drastically alter the output semantics.
    *   **Language Generation:** Anthropic's harmlessness dialogues, AdvBench harmful behaviors dataset, standard instruction-following benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval).
*   **Perturbations & Attacks:**
    *   **Certification:** We will certify robustness against $L_2$-norm bounded perturbations $\|\delta\|_2 \leq \epsilon$ in the respective embedding spaces ($e$).
    *   **Empirical Attacks:** We will craft adversarial perturbations $\delta$ in the embedding space aiming to induce specific harmful or undesired outputs (e.g., generating NSFW images from safe prompts, eliciting toxic responses from LLMs). We will adapt gradient-based attacks like PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) to operate on the embedding $e$, maximizing a loss function that encourages harmful generation, while staying within an $\epsilon$-ball.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Certified Robustness:** Report the certified radius $\epsilon$ achievable for a given noise level $\sigma$ and confidence parameter (e.g., 99.9%). Analyze the relationship between $\sigma$, $N$ (number of samples), and $\epsilon$.
    *   **Empirical Robustness:** Measure the success rate of the crafted adversarial attacks against the baseline model $G$ and the smoothed model $\tilde{G}$ for various $\epsilon$ bounds.
    *   **Generation Quality (Fidelity):**
        *   *Images:* Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), CLIP score (measuring alignment with the original prompt). Human evaluation (side-by-side comparisons) for perceptual quality and semantic correctness.
        *   *Text:* Perplexity (PPL), ROUGE, BLEU scores (for relevant tasks). Human evaluation for coherence, fluency, instruction following, and harmlessness. Toxicity scores using standard classifiers (e.g., Perspective API).
    *   **Computational Cost:** Measure the increase in inference time and memory usage due to sampling ($N>1$) compared to the baseline ($N=1$).
*   **Baselines:**
    *   Base model $G$ (no smoothing, $N=1, \sigma=0$).
    *   Adversarial training (if feasible): Train the embedding part $\phi$ or parts of $G$ using adversarial examples generated in the embedding space.
    *   Comparison with Zhang et al. (2021) if adaptable from GANs to diffusion/LLMs.

**3.6. Implementation Details**
We will leverage existing deep learning frameworks (PyTorch) and libraries (Hugging Face Transformers, Diffusers). The core implementation will involve modifying the inference pipelines of the chosen models to incorporate noise injection and sample aggregation. Certification code will build upon existing randomized smoothing libraries, adapting them for generative outputs and Wasserstein bounds. Experiments will be conducted on high-performance GPU clusters.

In conclusion, the SmoothGen project proposes a rigorous and innovative approach to certifying the robustness of modern conditional generative models. By combining theoretical development with extensive empirical validation, we aim to deliver a practical framework that significantly enhances the safety and reliability of these transformative AI technologies.
