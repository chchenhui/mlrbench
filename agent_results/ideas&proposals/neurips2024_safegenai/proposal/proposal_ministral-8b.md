SmoothGen – Certified Robustness via Randomized Smoothing for Conditional Generative Models

#### 2. Introduction

**Background:**
Generative models, such as diffusion models, large language models, and vision-language models, have revolutionized various domains, from scientific discovery to commercial applications. However, these models are highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, which can lead to harmful or misleading outputs. Ensuring the robustness of these models against such attacks is crucial for their safe deployment, especially in sensitive domains like medical image synthesis and legal drafting.

**Research Objectives:**
The primary objective of this research is to extend randomized smoothing—a technique used to certify robustness in classification tasks—to conditional generative models. We aim to develop a framework, SmoothGen, that provides provable, certified robustness against adversarial perturbations in the input conditions of these models. Additionally, we seek to maintain high generation quality while ensuring robustness, and explore adaptive noise calibration strategies to achieve optimal performance.

**Significance:**
The proposed SmoothGen framework addresses a critical gap in the current literature by offering the first certified adversarial protection for high-dimensional generative tasks. This research has the potential to significantly enhance the trust and safety of generative AI systems, mitigating risks associated with adversarial attacks and ensuring ethical deployment.

#### 3. Methodology

**3.1 Research Design**

**3.1.1 Overview:**
SmoothGen extends randomized smoothing to conditional generative models. For each input condition (e.g., text prompt or image seed), we sample noisy variants in the model's embedding space according to a carefully designed smoothing distribution. Each noisy input is passed through the base generative model, and the ensemble of outputs is aggregated into a smoothed generator. We derive theoretical certificates that bound the Wasserstein shift in the output distribution under any bounded perturbation of the original condition.

**3.1.2 Data Collection:**
We will use benchmark datasets and models for diffusion and autoregressive generative models, such as the CIFAR-10 dataset for image generation and the Penn Treebank dataset for text generation. Additionally, we will collect diverse real-world datasets to evaluate the robustness and generalization capabilities of SmoothGen.

**3.1.3 Algorithmic Steps:**

1. **Noise Sampling:**
   For each input condition \( x \), we sample \( n \) noisy variants \( x_i \) from a smoothing distribution \( \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \), where \( \mu \) is the original condition and \( \sigma \) is the noise standard deviation.

   \[
   x_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
   \]

2. **Model Inference:**
   Each noisy input \( x_i \) is passed through the base generative model \( G \) to produce a corresponding output \( y_i \).

   \[
   y_i = G(x_i)
   \]

3. **Output Aggregation:**
   The ensemble of outputs \( y_i \) is aggregated using a weighted average to form the smoothed generator output \( \hat{y} \).

   \[
   \hat{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i
   \]

4. **Robustness Certification:**
   We derive theoretical certificates that bound the Wasserstein shift in the output distribution \( \hat{y} \) under any bounded perturbation \( \delta \) of the original condition \( x \).

   \[
   W(\hat{y}, G(x + \delta)) \leq \epsilon
   \]

   where \( W \) denotes the Wasserstein distance and \( \epsilon \) is the certified robustness radius.

**3.1.4 Adaptive Noise Calibration:**
To preserve generation quality, we introduce adaptive noise schedules and gradient-based noise calibration in latent space. The noise standard deviation \( \sigma \) is adjusted based on the model's sensitivity to input perturbations and the desired robustness radius \( \epsilon \).

**3.1.5 Experimental Design:**
We will conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the certified robustness and perceptual fidelity of SmoothGen. The evaluation metrics include:

- **Certified Robustness Radius:** The maximum perturbation size \( \delta \) for which the output distribution remains within the certified bound.
- **Perceptual Fidelity:** Quantitative metrics such as Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) for image generation tasks, and BLEU and ROUGE scores for text generation tasks.
- **Computational Overhead:** The time complexity and memory requirements of the SmoothGen framework.

**3.2 Evaluation Metrics:**

- **Certified Robustness Radius:** Measures the maximum adversarial perturbation size for which the model's output remains within the certified bound.
- **Perceptual Fidelity:** Evaluates the quality of generated outputs using metrics like IS, FID, BLEU, and ROUGE.
- **Computational Efficiency:** Assesses the time complexity and memory requirements of the SmoothGen framework.
