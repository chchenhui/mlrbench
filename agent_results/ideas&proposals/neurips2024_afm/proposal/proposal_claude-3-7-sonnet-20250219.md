# Dynamic Sparse Adapters for Scalable Personalized Foundation Models: A Meta-Reinforcement Learning Approach

## 1. Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, foundation models have emerged as powerful tools capable of performing a wide range of tasks across various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal applications. These large-scale models, trained on vast amounts of data, exhibit remarkable zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. However, their generalist nature often fails to capture the nuanced preferences, requirements, and contexts of individual users. Personalization of foundation models has thus become a critical area of research to enhance user experience and improve model utility in real-world applications.

Current approaches to model personalization face significant challenges. Full fine-tuning, which involves updating all model parameters, is prohibitively expensive in terms of computation and memory requirements, particularly when scaling to millions of users. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and adapters reduce the parameter count but still impose considerable memory overhead when deployed at scale, as they require storing separate dense adaptation modules for each user. Furthermore, existing personalization techniques often struggle with catastrophic forgetting, privacy concerns, and the inability to adapt quickly to evolving user preferences.

The scalability challenge becomes particularly acute in real-world deployment scenarios. For instance, a personalized language model service with millions of users would need to maintain millions of separate adaptation modules, leading to prohibitive storage and serving costs. Similarly, resource-constrained edge devices cannot accommodate the memory footprint required by conventional personalization approaches, limiting the accessibility of personalized AI to those with access to substantial computational resources.

This research proposes a novel approach to address these challenges through the development of Dynamic Sparse Adapters (DSA). Unlike traditional dense adaptation methods, DSAs activate only a small, user-specific subset of parameters within a shared foundation model architecture. By dynamically routing information through sparse pathways tailored to individual users, DSAs dramatically reduce the memory footprint required for personalization while maintaining high performance. This sparsity-driven approach is complemented by meta-learning techniques for efficient adapter initialization and reinforcement learning for optimizing the gating policy that controls pathway selection.

The objectives of this research are threefold:
1. To develop a framework for dynamic sparse adaptation that enables efficient personalization of foundation models with minimal per-user memory overhead
2. To design and implement a meta-learning approach for initializing sparse adapters that can quickly adapt to new users with minimal data
3. To create a reinforcement learning-based gating mechanism that dynamically selects relevant sparse pathways based on user context and preferences

The significance of this research lies in its potential to democratize access to personalized AI by dramatically reducing the computational and memory requirements for model adaptation. By enabling efficient personalization on resource-constrained devices and services, DSAs could expand the reach of personalized AI to a broader user base, including those in resource-limited settings. Furthermore, the sparse adaptation approach inherently enhances privacy by limiting parameter updates to specific pathways, reducing the risk of memorization and potential data leakage.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Overview of Dynamic Sparse Adapters (DSA)

The DSA framework consists of three main components: (1) a foundation model backbone that remains largely frozen during personalization, (2) a set of sparse adapter modules that can be selectively activated, and (3) a gating network that dynamically controls which adapter components to activate based on user embeddings and input context. Figure 1. shows the overall architecture of the DSA framework.

The key innovation lies in the sparsity-constrained optimization of the adapter modules. Instead of updating all parameters in an adapter for each user, we selectively modify only a small subset, resulting in a sparse adaptation pattern. The gating network, trained via reinforcement learning, learns to identify which sparse pathways are most relevant for a given user and context, further enhancing efficiency.

### 2.2 Mathematical Formulation

Let $\mathcal{M}$ represent the foundation model with parameters $\theta$. For a user $u$ with data $\mathcal{D}_u$, we define a sparse adapter module $\mathcal{A}_u$ with parameters $\phi_u$, where most elements of $\phi_u$ are zero. The output of the adapted model for input $x$ is given by:

$$y = \mathcal{M}(x; \theta, \phi_u \odot g(x, u; \psi))$$

where $g(x, u; \psi)$ is the gating network with parameters $\psi$ that produces a binary mask, and $\odot$ represents element-wise multiplication.

The sparsity constraint on $\phi_u$ is formalized as:

$$\|\phi_u\|_0 \leq k$$

where $\|\cdot\|_0$ is the L0 norm (counting non-zero elements) and $k$ is a sparsity budget that is significantly smaller than the total parameter count of the adapter.

The optimization objective for user $u$ is:

$$\min_{\phi_u} \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D}_u; \theta, \phi_u \odot g(x, u; \psi)) \quad \text{subject to} \quad \|\phi_u\|_0 \leq k$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is a task-specific loss function.

### 2.3 Meta-Learning for Adapter Initialization

To efficiently initialize sparse adapters for new users with limited data, we employ a meta-learning approach. Let $\mathcal{U}$ be a set of users with their respective datasets $\{\mathcal{D}_u\}_{u \in \mathcal{U}}$. We split each user's data into support set $\mathcal{D}_u^s$ and query set $\mathcal{D}_u^q$.

The meta-learning objective is:

$$\min_{\phi_{\text{meta}}} \sum_{u \in \mathcal{U}} \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D}_u^q; \theta, \phi_u^* \odot g(x, u; \psi))$$

where $\phi_u^*$ is obtained by adapting $\phi_{\text{meta}}$ on the support set:

$$\phi_u^* = \phi_{\text{meta}} - \alpha \nabla_{\phi_{\text{meta}}} \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D}_u^s; \theta, \phi_{\text{meta}} \odot g(x, u; \psi))$$

with $\alpha$ being the adaptation learning rate.

The meta-initialization $\phi_{\text{meta}}$ serves as a starting point for personalizing adapters for new users, requiring only a few gradient steps on a small amount of user-specific data.

### 2.4 Reinforcement Learning for Gating Policy

The gating network $g(x, u; \psi)$ controls which components of the sparse adapter are activated for a given user and input. We formulate the learning of the gating policy as a reinforcement learning problem.

For each input $x$ from user $u$, the gating network selects a binary mask $m = g(x, u; \psi) \in \{0,1\}^{|\phi_u|}$ that determines which adapter parameters to activate. The state space includes the input context and user embedding, the action space consists of possible mask configurations, and the reward is defined as:

$$r(x, m, u) = -\mathcal{L}(y, \hat{y}) - \lambda \|m\|_0$$

where $\hat{y}$ is the ground truth, $y$ is the model output, and $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter controlling the trade-off between task performance and sparsity.

We optimize the gating policy using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with the objective:

$$\max_{\psi} \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}_u, m \sim g(x,u;\psi)} [r(x, m, u)]$$

To make the discrete mask selection differentiable during training, we use the Gumbel-Softmax trick:

$$m_i = \frac{\exp((\log(\pi_i) + g_i)/\tau)}{\sum_j \exp((\log(\pi_j) + g_j)/\tau)}$$

where $\pi_i$ is the probability of activating the $i$-th parameter, $g_i$ is a sample from the Gumbel distribution, and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.

### 2.5 Adapter Architecture

The sparse adapter modules are designed to be integrated into different layers of the foundation model. For transformer-based models, we insert adapters after the attention and feedforward layers:

$$h' = h + \text{Dropout}(W_{\text{down}}(\text{ReLU}(W_{\text{up}}h)))$$

where $h$ is the hidden state, $W_{\text{up}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ and $W_{\text{down}} \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d}$ are the adapter parameters with rank $r \ll d$.

In our sparse formulation, only a subset of elements in $W_{\text{up}}$ and $W_{\text{down}}$ are non-zero, controlled by the gating network.

### 2.6 Data Collection and Preprocessing

To evaluate the effectiveness of DSAs, we will collect and preprocess data from three different domains:

1. **Text Generation**: We will use a combination of public datasets (Reddit, Twitter) and synthetic data to create personalized text generation tasks. For each user, we will collect approximately 100-500 text samples reflecting their writing style, topics of interest, and interaction patterns.

2. **Image Customization**: Using publicly available image datasets (LAION, Flickr), we will create user-specific collections representing individual aesthetic preferences, subjects of interest, and stylistic choices.

3. **Recommendation**: We will leverage public recommendation datasets (MovieLens, Amazon Reviews) to train and evaluate personalized recommendation models.

Data preprocessing will include standard text tokenization, image resizing and normalization, and user preference encoding. For privacy reasons, all personally identifiable information will be removed, and synthetic data will be used to supplement real-world data when necessary.
