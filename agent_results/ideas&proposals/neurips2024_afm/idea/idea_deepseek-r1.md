**Title:** Dynamic Sparse Adapters for Scalable Personalized Foundation Models  

**Motivation:** Personalized adaptation in foundation models is critical for user-centric applications (e.g., chatbots, recommendation systems), but current methods like full fine-tuning or dense adapter layers are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, limiting scalability. This research addresses the challenge of enabling efficient, large-scale personalization without compromising model performance or user privacy.  

**Main Idea:** We propose *dynamic sparse adapters*—lightweight, user-specific modules that activate only a subset of a foundation model’s parameters. Each user’s adapter is trained using a sparsity-constrained optimization, where a gating network dynamically selects relevant sparse pathways based on user embeddings. This approach reduces memory overhead by sharing most parameters globally while allowing localized, personalized adaptations. The methodology combines meta-learning for initializing sparse adapters and reinforcement learning to optimize the gating policy. Experiments will measure personalization accuracy, inference speed, and memory efficiency across diverse tasks (e.g., text generation, image customization). Expected outcomes include a 5–10x reduction in per-user memory costs compared to dense adapters, with minimal performance loss. This innovation could democratize personalized AI for millions of users on resource-constrained devices.
