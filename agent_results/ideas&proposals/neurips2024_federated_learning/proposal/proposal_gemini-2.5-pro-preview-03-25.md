# **Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation for Foundation Models (FICPD)**

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and T5 [Raffel et al., 2020], represent a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence. Characterized by their enormous scale (billions of parameters) and pre-training on vast datasets, these models exhibit remarkable zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities across a wide range of tasks [Brown et al., 2020]. A key mechanism enabling this adaptability is **in-context learning (ICL)**, where the model conditions its predictions on a few demonstration examples provided within the input prompt, without requiring gradient updates. While powerful, effectively leveraging ICL often necessitates carefully engineered prompts or **prompt tuning**, where continuous "soft prompt" vectors are optimized for specific downstream tasks [Lester et al., 2021].

However, adapting FMs, especially through prompt tuning, faces significant hurdles in real-world scenarios. Many applications involve sensitive or proprietary data distributed across multiple organizations or devices (e.g., medical records in hospitals, financial data in banks, user data on mobile phones). Centralizing this data for prompt tuning is often infeasible due to privacy regulations (like GDPR), data sovereignty concerns, and prohibitive communication costs associated with transferring large datasets. Furthermore, the computational resources required for even fine-tuning prompts for massive FMs can be substantial.

**Federated Learning (FL)** [McMahan et al., 2017] emerges as a compelling solution. FL enables multiple clients (e.g., devices, organizations) to collaboratively train a shared model under the coordination of a central server, *without* sharing their local data. Each client trains the model on its local data, and only model updates (e.g., gradients, parameters) are sent to the server for aggregation. This paradigm inherently addresses data privacy and sovereignty concerns.

The convergence of FMs and FL, often termed **Federated Foundation Models** [Yu et al., 2023], is a rapidly growing research area. Applying FL to FMs, however, introduces new challenges:
*   **Communication Overhead:** Even transmitting updates for a small subset of parameters, like prompts, can be costly when dealing with numerous clients and frequent communication rounds.
*   **Data Heterogeneity:** Client data is often non-independently and identically distributed (Non-IID), varying in size, distribution, and application domain. This statistical heterogeneity can lead to divergent local model updates (client drift) and degrade the performance of the aggregated global model [Li et al., 2020].
*   **Model Complexity:** The sheer size of FMs complicates federated training and adaptation, demanding efficient algorithms and infrastructure.
*   **Privacy:** While FL avoids raw data sharing, transmitting model updates can still leak information about the underlying data [Zhu et al., 2019]. Stronger privacy guarantees, such as those provided by Differential Privacy (DP) [Dwork et al., 2006], are often necessary.

Recent research has explored **federated prompt tuning** [Sun et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2024; Che et al., 2023], often focusing on parameter-efficient techniques [Sun et al., 2022] and addressing black-box model limitations [Lin et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024] or specific applications like weather forecasting [Chen et al., 2023]. However, a key challenge remains: how to effectively aggregate diverse, context-specific prompts learned by heterogeneous clients into a globally useful yet compact representation that can enhance ICL performance for all participants, while ensuring privacy and communication efficiency. Existing methods often rely on simple averaging (like FedAvg) or basic distillation techniques, which may not adequately capture the diverse expertise encoded in client-specific prompts or efficiently handle the knowledge transfer.

### 1.2 Research Idea: Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation (FICPD)

We propose **Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation (FICPD)**, a novel FL framework designed to collaboratively refine and share in-context learning capabilities of FMs across distributed clients holding sensitive or siloed data. FICPD focuses on learning and distilling *soft prompts* â€“ continuous vectors prepended to the input embeddings that guide the FM's behavior for ICL tasks.

The core idea is multi-faceted:
1.  **Local Prompt Tuning:** Each client locally fine-tunes a small set of soft prompt vectors using its private data, adapting the FM's ICL capabilities to its specific context without modifying the base FM.
2.  **Privacy-Preserving & Compressed Updates:** Before uploading to the server, prompt updates are compressed (e.g., quantization) and sanitized using Differential Privacy mechanisms (e.g., adding Gaussian noise) to provide formal privacy guarantees and reduce communication bandwidth.
3.  **Server-Side Prototype Clustering:** The server receives the noisy, compressed prompt updates. Instead of simple averaging, it clusters the aggregated prompt embeddings to identify distinct "prototype" prompts, representing common underlying contexts or task variations across the client population.
4.  **Meta-Distillation:** Using a meta-learning approach, the server distills the knowledge from these diverse prototype prompts into a compact, universal *prompt library*. This library aims to generalize well across the different client distributions represented by the prototypes.
5.  **Broadcast and Integration:** The updated prompt library is broadcast back to the clients, who integrate it into their local prompt sets for the next round, enhancing their local ICL capabilities with distilled knowledge from the federation.

FICPD aims to bridge the gap between powerful, centralized FMs and the practical constraints of distributed, private data, enabling collaborative enhancement of ICL performance in a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving manner.

### 1.3 Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop the FICPD Framework:** Design and implement the end-to-end FICPD framework, including client-side prompt tuning, update compression and privatization, server-side clustering, meta-distillation of the prompt library, and client-side integration.
2.  **Optimize Privacy-Communication Trade-off:** Investigate and integrate effective differential privacy mechanisms and compression techniques for prompt updates, analyzing the trade-offs between privacy guarantees ($\epsilon, \delta$), communication bandwidth reduction, and model utility (task performance).
3.  **Enhance Heterogeneity Handling:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the prompt clustering and meta-distillation components in mitigating the negative effects of Non-IID data distributions across clients and improving the generalization of the learned prompt library.
4.  **Empirical Validation:** Conduct comprehensive experiments on diverse multilingual and domain-specific benchmark datasets to evaluate FICPD's performance in terms of task accuracy, privacy leakage risk (theoretical and potentially empirical), communication efficiency, and scalability compared to relevant baseline methods.
5.  **Ablation Studies:** Perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of each key component of FICPD (privacy mechanism, compression, clustering, meta-distillation).

### 1.4 Significance

This research holds significant potential impacts:

*   **Enabling Collaborative FM Adaptation:** FICPD offers a practical pathway for organizations or users to collaboratively adapt powerful FMs for improved ICL performance on their specific tasks without compromising data privacy or sovereignty.
*   **Advancing Federated Learning:** It introduces novel techniques for knowledge aggregation in FL, moving beyond simple averaging by incorporating clustering and meta-distillation specifically tailored for prompt tuning, potentially leading to more robust and generalizable federated models, especially under heterogeneity.
*   **Improving FM Accessibility:** By focusing on parameter-efficient prompt tuning and reducing communication load, FICPD can lower the barrier for deploying and adapting FMs in resource-constrained environments or large-scale federated networks.
*   **Strengthening Privacy-Preserving ML:** It contributes practical methods for applying differential privacy in the context of federated prompt tuning, providing quantifiable privacy guarantees for sensitive applications.
*   **Facilitating Real-World Applications:** The proposed framework could be applied in various domains like healthcare (federated analysis of clinical notes), finance (collaborative fraud detection models), and personalized services (on-device learning for user preference adaptation).

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Overall Framework

The FICPD framework operates iteratively over communication rounds $t = 1, 2, ..., T$. Let $N$ be the total number of clients, with $K$ clients participating in each round (where $K \le N$). Let $\theta_{FM}$ denote the parameters of the pre-trained (and frozen) foundation model. The goal is to learn a global prompt library $P_{global}$ that enhances ICL tasks across clients.

The workflow for a single round $t$ is as follows:

1.  **Broadcast:** The server sends the current global prompt library $P_{global}^{(t)}$ (and potentially instructions for accessing the frozen FM) to the $K$ selected clients.
2.  **Client Local Training:** Each participating client $k \in \{1, ..., K\}$ performs local prompt tuning using its private dataset $D_k$. It initializes its local prompts based on $P_{global}^{(t)}$ and optimizes them for a predefined number of local epochs.
3.  **Client Update Processing:** Client $k$ computes its prompt update $\Delta p_k^{(t)}$ (or the full tuned prompts $p_k^{(t+1)}$). It then compresses this update ($\Delta \tilde{p}_k^{(t)}$) and adds noise for differential privacy ($\Delta \hat{p}_k^{(t)}$).
4.  **Upload:** Clients upload their processed updates $\Delta \hat{p}_k^{(t)}$ to the server.
5.  **Server Aggregation & Distillation:** The server aggregates the received updates. It reconstructs the clients' tuned prompts $\hat{p}_k^{(t+1)}$ and performs:
    *   **Clustering:** Clusters the prompt embeddings $\{\hat{p}_k^{(t+1)}\}_{k=1}^K$ into $M$ prototype prompts $\{c_j\}_{j=1}^M$.
    *   **Meta-Distillation:** Learns an updated global prompt library $P_{global}^{(t+1)}$ by distilling knowledge from the prototypes $\{c_j\}$.
6.  **Iteration:** The process repeats for the next round.

### 2.2 Data Collection and Preparation

We will utilize publicly available benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating ICL and demonstrating heterogeneity challenges. Potential datasets include:

*   **Multilingual Tasks:**
    *   **XNLI** [Conneau et al., 2018]: Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference. We can simulate heterogeneity by assigning different languages to different clients.
    *   **PAWS-X** [Yang et al., 2019]: Cross-lingual Paraphrase Identification. Similar heterogeneity simulation strategy.
*   **Domain-Specific Tasks:**
    *   **PubMedQA** [Jin et al., 2019]: Biomedical Question Answering. Clients could represent different hospitals or research groups with potentially different data distributions or sub-domains.
    *   **FiQA** [Maia et al., 2018]: Financial Question Answering/Sentiment Analysis. Clients could represent different financial institutions.
*   **General NLP Tasks (for ICL benchmarking):** We may use subsets of GLUE [Wang et al., 2018] or SuperGLUE [Wang et al., 2019] benchmarks, distributing different tasks or skewed label distributions across clients.

**Data Partitioning:** To simulate realistic FL scenarios, we will partition datasets to create Non-IID distributions across clients using standard methods [Hsu et al., 2019]:
*   **Label Skew (Dirichlet Distribution):** Varying proportions of class labels assigned to clients.
*   **Feature Skew:** Different underlying features or domains across clients (e.g., different languages in XNLI).
*   **Quantity Skew:** Varying amounts of data per client.
We will also include an IID setting as a baseline comparison.

### 2.3 Algorithmic Details

#### 2.3.1 Client-Side: Local Prompt Tuning

Let the input to the FM for an ICL task consist of $E$ demonstration examples $(x_i^{demo}, y_i^{demo})$ and a query input $x_{query}$. Soft prompt tuning prepends learnable prompt vectors $p \in \mathbb{R}^{l \times d}$ (length $l$, embedding dimension $d$) to the input sequence embeddings. Client $k$ maintains a set of local prompts $P_k$, potentially initialized or augmented using the global library $P_{global}^{(t)}$. The client optimizes its prompts $P_k$ by minimizing a task-specific loss $\mathcal{L}_k$ (e.g., cross-entropy for classification) on its local data $D_k$, keeping the FM parameters $\theta_{FM}$ frozen:

$$
P_k^{(t+1)} = \arg \min_{P_k} \sum_{(x, y) \in D_k} \mathcal{L}_k(f(x; \theta_{FM}, P_k), y)
$$

Here, $f(\cdot)$ represents the FM's prediction function using the prepended prompts $P_k$. The optimization can be performed using standard gradient descent methods (e.g., AdamW) for $E_{local}$ local epochs. The prompt update can be defined as $\Delta p_k^{(t)} = p_k^{(t+1)} - p_{global}^{(t)}$ for each relevant prompt vector $p \in P_k$.

#### 2.3.2 Client-Side: Compression and Privacy

*   **Compression:** To reduce communication costs, the prompt updates $\Delta p_k^{(t)}$ (or full prompts $p_k^{(t+1)}$) can be compressed using techniques like:
    *   **Quantization:** Reducing the precision of floating-point values (e.g., to 16-bit or 8-bit floats, or fixed-point representation).
    *   **Sparsification:** Sending only the most significant components of the update vector (e.g., top-k selection).
    We denote the compressed update as $\Delta \tilde{p}_k^{(t)} = \text{Compress}(\Delta p_k^{(t)})$.
*   **Differential Privacy (DP):** To provide formal privacy guarantees, we will employ the Gaussian mechanism [Dwork et al., 2006]. Before uploading, client $k$ adds calibrated Gaussian noise to its compressed update:
    $$
    \Delta \hat{p}_k^{(t)} = \Delta \tilde{p}_k^{(t)} + \mathcal{N}(0, S^2 \sigma^2 I)
    $$
    Here, $S$ is the $L_2$-sensitivity of the update function (maximum possible $L_2$ norm of the update from removing one data point), typically enforced by clipping the norm of $\Delta \tilde{p}_k^{(t)}$ to a threshold $C$. The noise variance $\sigma^2$ is calibrated based on the clipping bound $C$, the number of local steps, the desired privacy budget $(\epsilon, \delta)$, and the number of participants, often analyzed using Moments Accountant [Abadi et al., 2016] or RÃ©nyi DP [Mironov, 2017].

#### 2.3.3 Server-Side: Aggregation, Clustering, and Meta-Distillation

Upon receiving $\{\Delta \hat{p}_k^{(t)}\}_{k=1}^K$, the server first reconstructs the noisy tuned prompts for each client, e.g., $\hat{p}_k^{(t+1)} = p_{global}^{(t)} + \Delta \hat{p}_k^{(t)}$.

*   **Clustering:** The server applies a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means or DBSCAN) to the set of received prompt embeddings $\{\hat{p}_k^{(t+1)} \in \mathbb{R}^{l \times d}\}_{k=1}^K$. This aims to group prompts that represent similar underlying data distributions or task specializations. The centroids or representative points of the resulting $M$ clusters form the *prototype prompts* $\{c_j\}_{j=1}^M$. The number of clusters $M$ can be a hyperparameter or determined adaptively.

*   **Meta-Distillation:** The core innovation lies in learning the next global prompt library $P_{global}^{(t+1)}$ from these diverse prototypes. We propose a meta-learning objective where the goal is to find a $P_{global}$ that performs well *on average* across the contexts represented by the prototypes. This can be framed as minimizing a meta-loss:
    $$
    P_{global}^{(t+1)} = \arg \min_{P} \sum_{j=1}^M w_j \mathbb{E}_{(x_j, y_j) \sim \mathcal{D}_j} [\mathcal{L}_{meta}(f(x_j; \theta_{FM}, P), y_j)]
    $$
    where $c_j$ implicitly defines a distribution $\mathcal{D}_j$ over task examples (or influences sampling from a generic meta-training dataset), $w_j$ is the weight of cluster $j$ (e.g., proportional to cluster size), and $\mathcal{L}_{meta}$ is a loss function measuring the performance of the library $P$ in the context $j$. The data $(x_j, y_j)$ could potentially be sampled from a public dataset or synthetically generated, guided by the prototype $c_j$, to avoid requiring server-side access to client-like data. The library $P_{global}$ could be a set of discrete soft prompt vectors or parameters of a small network that generates prompts. The optimization can leverage techniques inspired by MAML [Finn et al., 2017] or knowledge distillation [Hinton et al., 2015], where the prototypes act as "teacher" contexts for the global "student" library.

### 2.4 Experimental Design

*   **Foundation Model:** We plan to use a readily available FM suitable for prompt tuning, such as T5-base/large [Raffel et al., 2020] or potentially GPT-2 [Radford et al., 2019], depending on computational constraints. We will keep $\theta_{FM}$ frozen throughout the experiments.
*   **Clients and Rounds:** We will simulate FL scenarios with varying numbers of clients (e.g., $N=20, 50, 100$) and a client participation ratio (e.g., 10-20% per round) over a sufficient number of communication rounds (e.g., $T=100-500$).
*   **Baselines:** We will compare FICPD against:
    1.  **Centralized Tuning:** Prompt tuning performed on the pooled data from all clients (non-private upper bound).
    2.  **Local Tuning Only:** Each client tunes prompts only on its local data (no collaboration).
    3.  **FedAvg-Prompt:** Standard FedAvg [McMahan et al., 2017] applied directly to the soft prompt vectors.
    4.  **FedProx-Prompt:** FedProx [Li et al., 2020] applied to prompts to handle heterogeneity via a proximal term.
    5.  Relevant Federated Prompt Tuning Methods: e.g., FedBPT [Sun et al., 2023] (adapted for soft prompts if possible), FedHPL [Ma et al., 2024] (if logits are accessible or can be approximated).
*   **Hyperparameter Settings:** We will tune learning rates (client and server/meta), number of local epochs $E_{local}$, DP parameters $(\epsilon, \delta, C)$, compression levels, number of clusters $M$, and prompt length $l$. Tuning will be performed on a validation set or using cross-validation principles adapted for FL.
*   **Ablation Studies:** We will systematically disable components of FICPD (DP, compression, clustering, meta-distillation) to evaluate their individual contributions to performance, privacy, and efficiency. For instance, replace clustering+meta-distillation with simple averaging (FedAvg) on the noisy, compressed prompts.

### 2.5 Evaluation Metrics

We will evaluate the proposed method using the following metrics:

*   **Task Performance:** Standard metrics relevant to the downstream tasks (e.g., Accuracy for classification, F1-score, BLEU/ROUGE for generation/translation). Performance will be evaluated on a held-out global test set and potentially on local client test sets.
*   **Privacy:** Report the theoretical differential privacy budget $(\epsilon, \delta)$ achieved under the chosen parameters. We may also explore empirical privacy analysis using membership inference attacks [Shokri et al., 2017] as a complementary measure, comparing FICPD against non-private baselines.
*   **Communication Cost:** Measure the total number of bits transmitted between clients and the server per round and over the entire training process (uplink and downlink). Compare this with baselines, especially those transmitting gradients or larger model parts.
*   **Computational Cost:** Report average client-side training time per round and server-side aggregation/distillation time.
*   **Scalability:** Analyze how performance, communication, and computation scale as the number of clients ($N$) increases.
*   **Convergence Rate:** Plot task performance vs. communication rounds to assess how quickly FICPD converges compared to baselines.
*   **Heterogeneity Robustness:** Evaluate performance variation under different levels and types of Non-IID data distributions.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### 3.1 Expected Outcomes

1.  **A Novel FICPD Framework:** We expect to deliver a fully implemented and functional FICPD framework that integrates local prompt tuning, DP, compression, clustering, and meta-distillation for federated ICL adaptation of FMs.
2.  **Improved Performance under Heterogeneity:** We anticipate that FICPD, particularly through its clustering and meta-distillation steps, will outperform standard FL aggregation methods (like FedAvg-Prompt) on the chosen ICL tasks, especially under significant data heterogeneity (Non-IID settings). It should yield a global prompt library that generalizes better across diverse client needs.
3.  **Effective Privacy-Utility Trade-off:** Our experiments will demonstrate the trade-offs inherent in applying DP and compression. We expect FICPD to achieve meaningful task performance while providing strong $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees and significantly reducing communication costs compared to naive federated prompt tuning or methods involving larger parameter updates.
4.  **Quantifiable Benefits:** We will provide quantitative results comparing FICPD against baselines across metrics of accuracy, privacy, communication, and robustness to heterogeneity, highlighting the specific advantages of our approach.
5.  **Insights into Federated Prompt Management:** The research will generate valuable insights into the challenges and effective strategies for managing and aggregating prompt knowledge in large-scale federated networks. The effectiveness of clustering for identifying client contexts and meta-distillation for knowledge consolidation will be systematically analyzed.
6.  **Open Source Contribution:** We aim to release the code implementation of FICPD to facilitate reproducibility and further research in the community.

### 3.2 Potential Impact

This research addresses critical needs at the intersection of Foundation Models, Federated Learning, and Privacy-Preserving AI. Its potential impact is multi-fold:

*   **Scientific Impact:** FICPD introduces a novel approach to knowledge aggregation in FL, moving beyond simple averaging towards context-aware distillation. This contributes new techniques to the fields of federated learning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and privacy-preserving machine learning. It specifically addresses the under-explored area of federated *in-context learning* adaptation.
*   **Practical Impact:** By enabling privacy-preserving and communication-efficient collaborative prompt tuning, FICPD can unlock the use of powerful FMs in sensitive domains where data cannot be centralized, such as healthcare, finance, and cross-organizational collaborations. It lowers the resource barriers (communication, data sharing) for adapting these large models.
*   **Societal Impact:** Facilitating the responsible use of FMs on distributed, private data promotes innovation while upholding crucial privacy principles. It empowers users and organizations to become co-creators of AI solutions tailored to their needs, fostering trust and wider adoption of AI technologies. Furthermore, optimizing prompts for multilingual and cross-domain scenarios could lead to more equitable and accessible AI systems.

In conclusion, the proposed FICPD framework offers a promising direction for harnessing the power of foundation models in conjunction with federated learning principles, paving the way for more private, efficient, and collaborative AI development.
