**Title:**  
Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation for Foundation Models  

---

### 1. Introduction  
**Background**  
Foundation models (FMs), such as large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing and computer vision. These models excel at *in-context learning*, where task-specific prompts dynamically adapt their behavior without explicit retraining. However, refining prompts typically requires centralized access to sensitive or siloed data, raising privacy concerns and violating regulatory constraints like GDPR. Additionally, transmitting full model updates in federated settings strains communication bandwidth, especially when scaling to hundreds of clients. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across distributed data owners without raw data exchange. Yet, existing FL approaches for FMs often struggle with heterogeneous data distributions, communication inefficiency, and restricted access to model parameters in black-box settings.

**Research Objectives**  
This research proposes **Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation (FICPD)**, a framework designed to:  
1. Enable collaborative, privacy-preserving prompt tuning of FMs across distributed clients.  
2. Reduce communication overhead through prompt compression and meta-learning-driven distillation.  
3. Enhance in-context reasoning by aggregating diverse client-derived prompt prototypes.  
4. Validate the framework’s efficacy on multilingual and domain-specific benchmarks.  

**Significance**  
FICPD addresses critical gaps in federated FM adaptation by:  
- Eliminating raw data sharing and minimizing privacy risks via differential privacy (DP) and prompt sanitization.  
- Reducing communication costs by clustering and distilling prompts rather than transmitting full model updates.  
- Enhancing model adaptability through meta-learned universal prompt libraries that capture cross-client knowledge.  
- Enabling resource-efficient FM deployment on edge devices, aligning with real-world constraints.

### 2. Methodology  
**Research Design**  
FICPD operates in iterative client-server rounds (Figure 1):  
1. **Local Prompt Tuning**: Clients optimize soft prompt vectors using private data.  
2. **Privacy-Preserving Upload**: Compressed, noise-injected prompts are sent to the server.  
3. **Server-Side Prototype Extraction**: Prompts are clustered into domain-specific prototypes.  
4. **Meta-Distillation**: A universal prompt library is distilled from prototypes and broadcast to clients.

#### 2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
- **Datasets**: Experiments will use multilingual (e.g., XNLI, TyDi-QA) and domain-specific (e.g., medical MIMIC-III, legal ContractNLI) benchmarks.  
- **Heterogeneous Splits**: Non-iid data partitions simulate real-world client distributions. For example, legal clients receive contract data, while medical clients receive clinical notes.

#### 2.2 Algorithmic Framework  
**Local Prompt Tuning**  
Each client trains a soft prompt $p_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$ (d: hidden size, k: prompt length) appended to FM inputs. The loss for client $i$ is:  
$$\mathcal{L}_i = \sum_{(x,y) \in \mathcal{D}_i} \ell(f_\theta(x; p_i), y),$$  
where $f_\theta$ is the FM and $\ell$ is task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy).  

**Differential Privacy (DP) and Compression**  
Before transmission, prompts are:  
1. **Compressed**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces dimensionality to $p_i' \in \mathbb{R}^{d' \times k}$ ($d' \ll d$).  
2. **Sanitized**: Gaussian noise $\xi \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 \Delta^2)$ is added for $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP:  
$$p_i^{\text{DP}} = p_i' + \xi,$$  
where $\Delta$ is the L2-sensitivity of PCA-transformed prompts.  

**Server-Side Prototype Clustering**  
The server applies K-means to aggregate $p_i^{\text{DP}}$ from clients:  
$$\mathcal{C} = \{\mu_1, \dots, \mu_K\} = \text{K-means}\left(\{p_i^{\text{DP}}\}_{i=1}^N, K\right),$$  
where $\mu_k$ is the centroid of cluster $k$.  

**Meta-Learning for Universal Prompt Library**  
A meta-learner distills $\mathcal{C}$ into a compact library $\mathcal{P}^*$ via gradient-based optimization:  
$$\min_{\mathcal{P}^*} \sum_{\mu_k \in \mathcal{C}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{meta}}\left(f_\theta(\cdot; \mathcal{P}^*), f_\theta(\cdot; \mu_k)\right),$$  
where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{meta}}$ measures the performance gap between the meta-prompt and cluster centroids.

**Baselines**

- **FedProx** (Robust Aggregation)  
- **Centralized Prompt Tuning** (Non-FL upper bound)  

**Evaluation Metrics**  
1. **Task Accuracy**: F1-score, Exact Match (QA), BLEU (generation).  
2. **Privacy Leakage**: Membership inference (MI) attack success rate.  
3. **Communication Cost**: Transmitted bytes per client per round.  
4. **Convergence Speed**: Rounds to reach 95% of final accuracy.  

**Implementation Details**  
- **Models**: Flan-T5 (220M params) as the base FM.  
- **FL Settings**: 100 clients, 10% participation per round, 50 total rounds.  
- **Cluster Analysis**: Evaluate silhouette scores to validate prototype quality.

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **FICPD Framework**: A novel method for federated in-context prompt tuning with DP guarantees.  
2. **Performance Gains**: FICPD is expected to achieve 5–10% higher accuracy than FedAPT on heterogeneous benchmarks while reducing communication costs by 70% via compressed prompts.  
3. **Privacy Robustness**: MI attack success rates below 55% (near-random guessing) under $(\epsilon=2, \delta=10^{-5})$ settings.  

**Impact**  
- **Scalable Federated FMs**: Enables collaborative FM adaptation across thousands of clients without violating data sovereignty.  
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces per-client compute and communication overhead, making FM deployment feasible on edge devices.  
- **Community Benefits**: Open-source release of FICPD will accelerate research in federated prompt engineering and privacy-preserving FL.  

**Broader Implications**  
FICPD’s meta-distillation approach could generalize to other FM modalities (e.g., vision transformers) and federated transfer learning scenarios. Its success would underscore the viability of FL for aligning FMs with domain-specific needs, such as healthcare or finance, where data privacy is paramount.
