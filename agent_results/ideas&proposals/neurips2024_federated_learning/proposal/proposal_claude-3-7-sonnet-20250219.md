# Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation for Privacy-Preserving Foundation Model Adaptation

## 1. Introduction

Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized the artificial intelligence landscape with their remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. Models like GPT-4, PaLM, and LLaMA demonstrate exceptional performance in tasks ranging from natural language understanding to multimodal reasoning. A key strength of these models is their in-context learning abilityâ€”the capacity to adapt to new tasks through examples provided in the prompt without parameter updates. This capability allows for quick adaptation to domain-specific applications without expensive fine-tuning.

However, the current approaches to optimizing in-context prompts face critical limitations in real-world deployment scenarios. First, prompt engineering often requires centralized access to high-quality examples, which is problematic when working with sensitive, private, or geographically distributed data. Second, the manual or automated search for effective prompts typically requires extensive computation and expert knowledge. Third, the resulting prompts often lack adaptability across diverse domains and tasks, necessitating resource-intensive retuning for new applications.

These challenges are particularly acute in environments where data cannot be centralized due to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR), proprietary concerns, or technical constraints. Healthcare institutions, financial organizations, and edge computing environments all possess valuable domain knowledge locked in siloed data repositories that could significantly enhance foundation model performance if properly leveraged.

Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for training models across distributed data sources without raw data sharing. While traditional FL approaches focus on model parameter updates, they face significant challenges when applied to foundation models, including communication overhead, computational demands, and privacy concerns related to gradient information. Moreover, full model fine-tuning may not be feasible or desirable for many foundation model deployments.

This research proposes Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation (FICPD), a novel framework that bridges the gap between federated learning and in-context adaptation of foundation models. FICPD enables collaborative prompt optimization across distributed clients while preserving data privacy, minimizing communication costs, and accommodating heterogeneous data distributions. Rather than sharing raw data or updating model parameters, clients distill knowledge from their local examples into compact prompt representations, which are then aggregated and refined at the server to create a universal prompt library that captures diverse domain expertise.

The primary research objectives of this study are to:

1. Develop a federated framework for privacy-preserving distillation of in-context prompts across distributed clients without sharing raw data.
2. Design efficient prompt representation, compression, and sanitization techniques that minimize communication overhead while preserving utility.
3. Create adaptive prompt aggregation methods that can handle non-IID data distributions and capture diverse domain knowledge.
4. Establish a meta-learning approach for distilling clustered prompt prototypes into a compact, universal prompt library.
5. Evaluate the effectiveness of FICPD across multilingual and domain-specific tasks, comparing against centralized prompt tuning and traditional federated learning approaches.

The significance of this research extends beyond technical innovation. By enabling collaborative adaptation of foundation models without data centralization, FICPD democratizes access to advanced AI capabilities while respecting data sovereignty. This approach has profound implications for domains like healthcare, finance, and edge computing, where data privacy concerns have limited the adoption of foundation models. Furthermore, by focusing on in-context learning rather than parameter updates, FICPD offers a resource-efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning, making foundation models more accessible to resource-constrained environments.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Overview of FICPD Framework

The Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation (FICPD) framework consists of four main components: (1) local prompt optimization, (2) privacy-preserving prompt compression, (3) server-side prompt clustering and distillation, and (4) client-side prompt integration. Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of FICPD.

The key innovation of FICPD lies in its focus on optimizing in-context prompts rather than model parameters. Instead of sharing raw data or model gradients, clients collaborate to build a diverse library of effective prompts that capture domain-specific knowledge while preserving privacy. The framework accommodates heterogeneous data distributions and allows for personalization while maintaining a global understanding of effective prompting strategies.

### 2.2 Local Prompt Optimization

Each client $i \in \{1, 2, ..., N\}$ possesses a local dataset $D_i = \{(x_j, y_j)\}_{j=1}^{m_i}$ consisting of input-output pairs. The client aims to find an optimal soft prompt $P_i$ that maximizes the performance of a foundation model $F$ on their local dataset.

We define a soft prompt $P$ as a sequence of continuous embedding vectors $P = [p_1, p_2, ..., p_L]$ where $p_j \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $d$ is the embedding dimension of the foundation model. Unlike discrete prompts composed of tokens from the model's vocabulary, soft prompts allow for continuous optimization in the embedding space.

For each client, we formulate the local prompt optimization problem as:

$$P_i^* = \arg\min_{P_i} \mathcal{L}(F(P_i \oplus x_j), y_j)$$

where $\oplus$ denotes the concatenation operation, and $\mathcal{L}$ is a task-specific loss function. This optimization can be performed using gradient descent:

$$P_i^{(t+1)} = P_i^{(t)} - \eta \nabla_{P_i} \mathcal{L}(F(P_i^{(t)} \oplus x_j), y_j)$$

To enhance generalization, we employ prompt dropout during training:

$$\hat{P}_i^{(t)} = \text{Dropout}(P_i^{(t)}, p_{\text{drop}})$$

where $p_{\text{drop}}$ is the dropout probability. This regularization technique helps prevent overfitting to local data and improves the transferability of the resulting prompts.

### 2.3 Privacy-Preserving Prompt Compression

After local optimization, each client must prepare their prompt for transmission to the server. Direct sharing of optimized prompts may leak information about the client's local data. Therefore, we apply a two-step process of compression and privacy sanitization.

First, we employ a dimensionality reduction technique to compress the prompt representation:

$$\tilde{P}_i = \text{Compress}(P_i^*)$$

We investigate two compression approaches:
1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): $\tilde{P}_i = U_k^T P_i^*$, where $U_k$ contains the top $k$ principal components.
2. Autoencoder Compression: $\tilde{P}_i = \text{Encoder}(P_i^*)$, where the encoder is a neural network trained to minimize reconstruction error.

Next, we apply differential privacy mechanisms to provide formal privacy guarantees. We add calibrated noise to the compressed prompt:

$$\hat{P}_i = \tilde{P}_i + \mathcal{Z}$$

where $\mathcal{Z}$ is a noise vector sampled from a distribution that ensures $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. For Gaussian mechanism:

$$\mathcal{Z} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$$

where $\sigma = \frac{c \cdot \Delta f}{\epsilon}$ with $c$ being a constant, $\Delta f$ the sensitivity of the compression function, and $\epsilon$ the privacy parameter.

To further enhance privacy while maintaining utility, we implement a projective mechanism that constrains the compressed prompt to lie within a predefined subspace:

$$\hat{P}_i^{\text{final}} = \text{Project}(\hat{P}_i, \mathcal{S})$$

where $\mathcal{S}$ is a subspace learned from public data or predefined by the system.

### 2.4 Server-Side Prompt Clustering and Distillation

The server receives sanitized prompt representations $\{\hat{P}_1^{\text{final}}, \hat{P}_2^{\text{final}}, ..., \hat{P}_N^{\text{final}}\}$ from all participating clients. To handle heterogeneity in client data distributions, we employ a clustering approach to identify prototype prompts that represent different domains or tasks.

We first perform clustering in the prompt embedding space:

$$\{C_1, C_2, ..., C_K\} = \text{Cluster}(\{\hat{P}_1^{\text{final}}, \hat{P}_2^{\text{final}}, ..., \hat{P}_N^{\text{final}}\}, K)$$

where $K$ is the number of clusters determined using a combination of silhouette score and elbow method, and $C_k$ represents the set of prompt embeddings assigned to cluster $k$.

For each cluster, we derive a prototype prompt by:

$$P_k^{\text{proto}} = \frac{1}{|C_k|} \sum_{P \in C_k} P$$

These prototype prompts capture different domains or patterns present in the client population. To further refine and distill these prototypes into a compact, universal prompt library, we employ a meta-learning approach.

We define a prompt library $\mathcal{L} = \{P^{\text{lib}}_1, P^{\text{lib}}_2, ..., P^{\text{lib}}_M\}$ where $M \ll K$ is the size of the library. The objective is to find a library that can reconstruct any prototype prompt with minimal error:

$$\mathcal{L}^* = \arg\min_{\mathcal{L}} \sum_{k=1}^K \min_{\alpha_k} \|P_k^{\text{proto}} - \sum_{j=1}^M \alpha_{k,j} P^{\text{lib}}_j\|^2 + \lambda \|\alpha_k\|_1$$

where $\alpha_k$ is a sparse coefficient vector, and $\lambda$ controls the sparsity level. This formulation allows us to distill the knowledge from multiple prototype prompts into a compact library while encouraging sparse combinations for efficiency.

We solve this optimization problem using alternating minimization:
1. Fix $\mathcal{L}$ and optimize for $\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_K\}$
2. Fix $\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_K\}$ and optimize for $\mathcal{L}$

The resulting prompt library $\mathcal{L}^*$ is then broadcast back to all clients.

### 2.5 Client-Side Prompt Integration

Upon receiving the universal prompt library $\mathcal{L}^*$, each client adapts it to their local context. Client $i$ computes an optimal combination of library prompts for their specific task:

$$\alpha_i^* = \arg\min_{\alpha_i} \mathcal{L}(F(\sum_{j=1}^M \alpha_{i,j} P^{\text{lib}}_j \oplus x), y) + \lambda \|\alpha_i\|_1$$

where $(x, y)$ are samples from the client's validation set. The client can then use the integrated prompt:

$$P_i^{\text{integrated}} = \sum_{j=1}^M \alpha_{i,j}^* P^{\text{lib}}_j$$

For inference on new samples, the foundation model is prompted with:

$$\hat{y} = F(P_i^{\text{integrated}} \oplus x_{\text{new}})$$

To further personalize the prompts while leveraging the global knowledge, we implement a gating mechanism:

$$P_i^{\text{final}} = g_i \cdot P_i^* + (1 - g_i) \cdot P_i^{\text{integrated}}$$

where $g_i \in [0, 1]$ is a learnable parameter that controls the balance between the locally optimized prompt and the library-based prompt.

### 2.6 Experimental Design

We will evaluate FICPD on the following benchmarks:

1. **Multilingual Language Understanding**: Using XLM-RoBERTa as the foundation model, we will evaluate on the XNLI dataset covering 15 languages, with each client assigned examples from a specific language.

2. **Domain-Specific Question Answering**: Using GPT models, we will evaluate on a combination of datasets including SQuAD (general domain), BioASQ (biomedical), and FinQA (financial), with clients clustered by domain.

3. **Cross-Silo Clinical Text Classification**: Using clinical BERT models, we will evaluate on the MIMIC-III dataset with different healthcare institutions as clients, respecting realistic data silos.

For each benchmark, we will compare FICPD against the following baselines:
- Centralized prompt tuning (oracle with access to all data)
- Local prompt tuning (no collaboration)
- Traditional federated learning with full model updates
- Federated learning with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (adapter-based)
- Knowledge distillation-based federated learning

We will evaluate the performance using the following metrics:
- Task-specific accuracy, F1 score, or ROUGE/BLEU for generation tasks
- Communication cost (total bytes transmitted)
- Computational efficiency (training time, memory usage)
- Privacy leakage measured via membership inference attacks
- Convergence rate across communication rounds

To assess the effectiveness of different components of FICPD, we will conduct ablation studies on:
- Prompt compression techniques
- Privacy mechanisms and their parameters
- Clustering algorithms and the number of prototypes
- Meta-learning approaches for prompt distillation
- Client-side integration strategies

All experiments will be run with 5 random seeds, and statistical significance tests will be performed to ensure the reliability of the results.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

The proposed research on Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation (FICPD) is expected to yield several significant outcomes with far-reaching implications for the deployment of foundation models in privacy-sensitive and distributed environments.

### 3.1 Technical Contributions

First, we anticipate that FICPD will demonstrate superior performance compared to local prompt tuning approaches, achieving at least 85-90% of the accuracy of centralized prompt tuning while preserving privacy. This would represent a significant advancement in balancing utility and privacy in foundation model adaptation. The framework is expected to be particularly effective in heterogeneous data environments, where traditional federated learning methods struggle with client drift and convergence issues.

Second, we expect to establish formal privacy guarantees through differential privacy mechanisms tailored specifically for prompt representations. Our analysis will provide theoretical bounds on the amount of information leakage from the shared prompt embeddings, with empirical validation through membership inference attacks showing minimal success rates (below 55%, close to random guessing).

Third, the research will produce a compact, universal prompt library that effectively captures diverse domain knowledge with significantly reduced dimensionality compared to the collective original prompts. We anticipate achieving a compression ratio of at least 10:1 while maintaining 95% of the performance, demonstrating the efficiency of our meta-learning approach for knowledge distillation.

Fourth, FICPD is expected to reduce communication costs by at least two orders of magnitude compared to traditional federated learning approaches that share model parameters or gradients. This efficiency gain will be crucial for enabling foundation model adaptation in bandwidth-constrained environments like edge computing or mobile devices.

### 3.2 Broader Impact

Beyond these technical contributions, FICPD has the potential to democratize access to foundation model capabilities across various sectors:

In healthcare, FICPD would enable multiple hospitals and research institutions to collaboratively improve the performance of foundation models on clinical tasks without sharing sensitive patient data. This could accelerate the development of AI-assisted diagnostic tools, clinical decision support systems, and automated medical documentation while maintaining HIPAA compliance.

For multilingual applications, FICPD would allow users from different language regions to contribute their linguistic knowledge to improve foundation model performance across languages, addressing current disparities in model performance between high-resource and low-resource languages. This has significant implications for digital inclusion and equitable AI access.

In financial services, FICPD would facilitate collaborative improvement of fraud detection, risk assessment, and financial advice systems across institutions without compromising proprietary data or customer privacy. This could enhance the security and effectiveness of financial systems while maintaining regulatory compliance.

For edge computing environments, FICPD would enable efficient adaptation of foundation models across distributed Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart homes, or autonomous vehicles. By focusing on prompt optimization rather than full model training, even resource-constrained devices could contribute to and benefit from collaborative learning.

### 3.3 Future Research Directions

The findings from this research will open several promising avenues for future investigation:

1. **Dynamic Prompt Libraries**: Extending FICPD to support continuous learning where the prompt library evolves over time as new data and tasks emerge.

2. **Multimodal Federated Prompting**: Adapting FICPD for multimodal foundation models that incorporate image, video, and audio data alongside text.

3. **Hierarchical Federated Prompting**: Developing hierarchical approaches that capture both domain-specific and cross-domain knowledge at different levels of abstraction.

4. **Adversarial Robustness**: Enhancing the security of FICPD against adversarial attacks that may attempt to poison the prompt library or extract sensitive information.

5. **Theoretical Understanding**: Developing a deeper theoretical understanding of how prompt distillation relates to knowledge transfer and representation learning in distributed environments.

In conclusion, FICPD represents a significant step toward bridging privacy-preserving distributed learning with the capabilities of foundation models. By enabling collaborative prompt optimization without raw data sharing, FICPD addresses a critical gap in current approaches to foundation model adaptation and opens new possibilities for privacy-respecting AI systems in various domains. The expected outcomes of this research will not only advance the technical state-of-the-art but also contribute to the responsible and inclusive deployment of AI technologies across society.
