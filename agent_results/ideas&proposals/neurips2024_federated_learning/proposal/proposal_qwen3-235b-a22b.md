# Title  
**Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation for Foundation Models**  

---

# Introduction  

## Background  
Foundation models (FMs), such as large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, have become cornerstone technologies in artificial intelligence, enabling transformative capabilities in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and beyond. Their ability to perform *in-context learning* (ICL) by leveraging a few examples or prompts to adapt to new tasks eliminates the need for full model fine-tuning. However, conventional ICL methods rely on centralized prompt tuning using sensitive or siloed data, which conflicts with emerging privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and practical constraints in distributed systems. Federated learning (FL), a decentralized paradigm where clients collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, offers a promising solution to these challenges. Combining FL with FM prompt tuning—termed Federated Transfer Learning for Foundation Models (FTL-FM)—has gained traction as a privacy-preserving and resource-efficient approach to model adaptation.  

Recent works, such as FedHPL (logit distillation with prompt tuning) and FedBPT (black-box gradient-free prompt optimization), have demonstrated the feasibility of FL-driven prompt tuning. These methods reduce communication costs by transmitting only prompt vectors instead of full model gradients. However, they often assume homogeneous prompt updates or lack robust mechanisms to synthesize diverse domain-specific knowledge across clients into a *unified prompt library*. This limits their applicability in cross-domain or cross-lingual scenarios where clients exhibit heterogeneous data distributions and task requirements. Furthermore, most existing frameworks neglect the dual challenges of (1) **preserving privacy during inter-client knowledge aggregation** and (2) **distilling universally effective prompts via meta-learning**.  

## Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop **Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation** (FICPD), a novel framework that addresses the key challenges of FTL-FM by:  
1. **Privacy-preserving prompt tuning**: Enable collaborative refinement of soft prompts without exposing raw data or full model weights.  
2. **Communication efficiency**: Compress prompt updates to minimize bandwidth usage during federated synchronization.  
3. **Knowledge distillation via clustering**: Aggregate prompt embeddings into prototypes to capture domain-specific expertise, then distill these prototypes into a universal prompt library using meta-learning.  
4. **Cross-client adaptability**: Equip clients with the ability to leverage the universal library for in-context learning on unseen tasks.  

## Significance  
FICPD resolves critical bottlenecks in FL for FMs:  
- **Data privacy**: By sanitizing prompt updates with differential privacy (DP), we avoid exposing sensitive information while enabling collaborative learning.  
- **Scalability**: The compact nature of prompts reduces communication overhead, allowing deployment across hundreds of clients.  
- **Heterogeneity**: Clustering ensures diverse domain knowledge is preserved in the global prompt library, which is crucial for cross-lingual or industrial applications.  
- **Model utility**: Meta-learning optimizes the prompt library to maintain FM performance, bridging the gap between centralized ICL and distributed adaptation.  

This work aligns with the growing demand for FL frameworks that harmonize FM capabilities with decentralized data realities in healthcare, finance, and edge computing.

# Methodology  

## Research Design and Framework  

FICPD operates in *multi-stage model training* and *federated knowledge distillation* paradigms. The framework comprises two phases:  
1. **Client-side prompt optimization** with DP-compressed gradients.  
2. **Server-side prototype clustering** and meta-learning distillation.  

The architecture is illustrated in **Figure 1** (not shown).  

### 1. Client-Side Soft Prompt Training  

Each client $ i \in [1, N] $ holds local data $ \mathcal{D}_i $ and a pre-trained foundation model $ \mathcal{F}_\theta $ with fixed weights $ \theta $. Clients tune only small-dimensional soft prompts $ \mathbf{p}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times L} $, where $ d $ is the model's embedding dimension and $ L $ is the prompt length (e.g., $ L=20 $).  

**Optimization Objective**:  
Clients minimize the task-specific loss while regularizing prompt updates to prevent overfitting:  
$$ \min_{\mathbf{p}_i} \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(\mathcal{F}_{\theta}(\mathbf{p}_i; \mathcal{D}_i)) + \lambda ||\mathbf{p}_i||_2, $$  
where $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} $ is task-specific (e.g., cross-entropy for classification, BLEU scores for generation), and $ \lambda $ controls regularization strength.  

**Gradient-Free Prompt Tuning**:  
To accommodate black-box models (where $ \theta $ is inaccessible), clients use **zeroth-order optimization** (ZOOPT) with perturbations to estimate gradients. Given a perturbation parameter $ \mu \in \mathbb{R}^+ $, clients approximate gradients via:  
$$ \nabla \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} \approx \frac{1}{2\mu} \sum_{k=1}^K [\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(\mathbf{p}_i + \mu \cdot \mathbf{e}_k) - \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(\mathbf{p}_i - \mu \cdot \mathbf{e}_k)] \cdot \mathbf{e}_k, $$  
where $ \mathbf{e}_k \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times L} $ is the perturbation direction. This mirrors the approach of FedBPT (2023) but integrates DP for added privacy.  

**Differential Privacy (DP) Sanitization**:  
Prompt updates $ \mathbf{p}_i^{(t)} $ at round $ t $ are compressed using **randomized matrix projection** and augmented with DP noise. Let $ \mathbf{W}_{\text{comp}} \in \mathbb{R}^{L' \times L} $ (where $ L' \ll L $) denote the compression matrix. The sanitized prompt is:  
$$ \tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^{(t)} = \mathbf{W}_{\text{comp}} \mathbf{p}_i^{(t)} + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2), $$  
where $ \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2) $ is Gaussian noise scaled to satisfy $ (\epsilon, \delta) $-DP constraints.  

### 2. Server-Side Clustering and Meta-Learning Distillation  

The server collects $ \tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^{(t)} $ from a subset of clients in each round.  

**Prototype Embedding Clustering**:  
Using **cosine similarity** as the metric, the server applies K-means on compressed prompts to group updates into $ K $ prototypes $ \mathcal{C} = \{\mathbf{c}_1, \dots, \mathbf{c}_K\} $. Let $ S_k $ denote the set of clients assigned to cluster $ k $. The centroid update rule is:  
$$ \mathbf{c}_k^{(t+1)} = \frac{1}{|S_k|} \sum_{i \in S_k} \tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^{(t)}, $$  
where similarity is computed as $ \text{sim}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^{(t)}, \tilde{\mathbf{c}}_j^{(t)}) = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^{(t)} \cdot \tilde{\mathbf{c}}_j^{(t)}}{\|\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^{(t)}\| \cdot \|\tilde{\mathbf{c}}_j^{(t)}\|} $.  

**Meta-Learning for Distillation**:  
The server trains a meta-prompt library $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{prompt}} $ that generalizes across prototypes. For each task $ k $, the FM generates synthetic examples $ \mathcal{X}_k = \mathcal{F}_\theta(\mathbf{c}_k; \mathcal{Z}) $, where $ \mathcal{Z} $ is a seed input space. The library is optimized via the following meta-loss:  
$$ \nabla \mathcal{L}_{\text{meta}} = \sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}_k} \left( y_k - \mathcal{F}_{\theta}(\mathcal{L}_{\text{prompt}}^{(t)}; x) \right)^2, $$  
where $ y_k $ is the desired output. This builds upon FedHPL’s (2024) logit distillation but applies it to prompt prototypes.  

**Communication Efficiency**:  
By compressing prototypes to $ L' $ dimensions, FICPD reduces upload bandwidth by $ 100 \times (1 - L'/L) \% $. For example, a $ L'=5 $ prompt compresses updates 4x compared to $ L=20 $.

2. **Privacy Leakage**: Measure membership inference attack success rate (Yeom et al., 2018).  
3. **Communication Cost**: Total data transmitted per round in MB.  
4. **Convergence Speed**: Rounds required to reach baseline accuracy.  
5. **Fairness**: Disparate impact across clients using demographic parity measures.

- Trade-offs between $ \epsilon $ and utility.  
- Role of clustering vs. naive prototype averaging.

## Algorithmic Details  

### Client Updates  

We implement soft prompt tuning as a **prefix injection** in transformer-based models. For an input sequence $ \mathbf{x} $, the FM computes:  
$$ \mathbf{z}_{\text{context}} = \mathcal{T}(\mathbf{p}_i \oplus \mathbf{x}), $$  
where $ \mathcal{T} $ denotes the transformer’s first few self-attention layers applied to the concatenated prefix $ \mathbf{p}_i $ and input $ \mathbf{x} $.  

To mitigate client drift in non-IID data, we use **proximity regularization** inspired by FedProx (Li et al., 2020):  
$$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda \cdot ||\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}^{(t)}||_2^2, $$  
where $ \mathbf{p}^{(t)} $ is the global prompt library broadcasted at round $ t $.  

### Server Aggregation  

The server performs prototype clustering followed by meta-learning:  

```python  
while not converged:  
    for client in sample_clients():  
        # Client: compute and sanitize prompts  
        local_prompt = client_prompt_tuning()  
        compressed_prompt = dp_compress(local_prompt)  
        send_to_server(compressed_prompt)  

    # Server: aggregate and distill  
    prototypes = kmeans(compressed_prompts)  
    meta_prompt_library = maml_step(prototypes)  
    send_to_clients(meta_prompt_library)  
```  

This iterative process aligns with the **multi-stage training** principle outlined in the task description.

# Expected Outcomes  

1. **Improved Cross-Domain Performance**:  
   FICPD will outperform FedHPL and FedDTPT on XGLUE and MedQA by at least 5% in accuracy, as clustered prototypes preserve domain-specific knowledge.  

2. **Communication Efficiency**:  
   Prompt compression will reduce upload sizes by 60–80% compared to transmitting full gradients. For example, a RoBERTa-base model (85M parameters) requires ~300MB gradients per client, whereas FICPD’s $ L'=5 $ prompts require only 2MB.  

3. **Privacy Guarantees**:  
   $ (\epsilon=2, \delta=10^{-5}) $-DP will limit membership inference attacks to ≤15% success rate (vs. ≤25% for FedBPT).  

4. **Generalization**:  
   The universal prompt library will enable clients to adapt to unseen tasks (e.g., low-resource languages) via in-context reasoning.  

5. **Scalability**:  
   FICPD will maintain sub-1% accuracy drop when scaling from 10 to 500 clients, thanks to meta-learning’s ability to synthesize global knowledge.
