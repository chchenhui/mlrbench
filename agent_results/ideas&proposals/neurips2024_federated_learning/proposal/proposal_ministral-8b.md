# Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation for Foundation Models

## Introduction

Foundation models (FMs), characterized by their scale and broad applicability, have revolutionized various domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. However, their training and deployment face significant challenges, particularly concerning data privacy, efficiency, and scalability. Federated learning (FL), a paradigm that enables distributed model training while preserving data privacy, offers a promising solution. This research proposal explores the integration of federated learning with in-context learning to create a privacy-preserving framework for.foundation models.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. To develop a federated in-context prompt distillation framework (FICPD) that allows clients to collaboratively refine in-context prompts without exposing raw data.
2. To evaluate the performance, privacy, and communication efficiency of FICPD on multilingual and domain-specific benchmarks.
3. To demonstrate the effectiveness of FICPD in handling data heterogeneity, communication overhead, and privacy preservation challenges.

### Significance

The significance of this research lies in its potential to:
1. Enhance the privacy and efficiency of foundation model training in distributed settings.
2. Enable collaborative, resource-efficient prompt adaptation that respects data sovereignty.
3. Scale to hundreds of clients, making FL more accessible and practical for real-world applications.

## Methodology

### Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation Framework (FICPD)

FICPD consists of three main stages: local prompt fine-tuning, server-side prompt distillation, and client-side integration. The detailed steps are as follows:

#### 1. Local Prompt Fine-Tuning

Each client $k$ uses local examples to fine-tune a small set of soft prompt vectors $\mathbf{p}_k$ without exposing raw data. The fine-tuning process can be described as:

$$ \mathbf{p}_k = \mathbf{p}_k^{0} + \eta \nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{p}_k, \mathcal{D}_k) $$

where $\mathbf{p}_k^{0}$ is the initial prompt vector, $\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{p}_k, \mathcal{D}_k)$ is the loss function based on the local data $\mathcal{D}_k$.

#### 2. Server-Side Prompt Distillation

Before uploading, prompt updates are compressed and sanitized via differential privacy. The server clusters received prompt embeddings into prototype prompts $\mathbf{q}_i$ that capture diverse domain contexts:

$$ \mathbf{q}_i = \arg \min_{\mathbf{q}} \sum_{k} \| \mathbf{p}_k - \mathbf{q} \|_2^2 $$

Using meta-learning, the server distills these prototypes into a compact, universal prompt library $\mathbf{Q}$:

$$ \mathbf{Q} = \arg \min_{\mathbf{Q}} \sum_{i} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{q}_i, \mathbf{Q}) $$

where $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{q}_i, \mathbf{Q})$ is the meta-learning loss function.

#### 3. Client-Side Integration

Clients integrate the updated prompt library $\mathbf{Q}$ for richer in-context reasoning:

$$ \mathbf{p}_k = \mathbf{p}_k^{0} + \eta \nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{p}_k, \mathbf{Q}) $$

### Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate FICPD, we will use the following metrics:
1. **Task Accuracy**: Measure the performance of the model on the downstream task using standard evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).
2. **Privacy Leakage**: Quantify the amount of information leaked during the training process using metrics such as the differential privacy parameter $\epsilon$.
3. **Communication Cost**: Measure the total amount of data transmitted between clients and the server.

### Experimental Design

We will evaluate FICPD on multilingual and domain-specific benchmarks, including:
1. **Multilingual Benchmarks**: Benchmarks such as XNLI, MMLU, and XQuAD to evaluate the performance of FICPD on multilingual datasets.
2. **Domain-Specific Benchmarks**: Domain-specific benchmarks such as MedQA, SciERC, and AG News to evaluate the performance of FICPD on domain-specific datasets.

### Mathematical Formulations

The loss function for local prompt fine-tuning can be written as:

$$ \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{p}_k, \mathcal{D}_k) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{D}_k} \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(\mathbf{p}_k, x) $$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(\mathbf{p}_k, x)$ is the task-specific loss function.

The meta-learning loss function for server-side prompt distillation can be written as:

$$ \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{q}_i, \mathbf{Q}) = \sum_{k} \| \mathbf{p}_k - \mathbf{q}_i \|_2^2 + \lambda \| \mathbf{q}_i - \mathbf{Q} \|_2^2 $$

where $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter.
