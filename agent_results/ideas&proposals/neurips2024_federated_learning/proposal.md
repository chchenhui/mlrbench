Title: Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation for Privacy-Preserving Collaboration in Foundation Models

1. Introduction  
Background  
Foundation models (FMs), in particular large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, exhibit remarkable in-context learning capabilities by conditioning on prompt examples rather than updating millions of parameters. At the same time, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for training models across distributed, privacy-sensitive data silos. Existing FL work on prompt tuning (e.g., FedHPL [1], FedBPT [2]) has demonstrated that lightweight prompt vectors can be fine-tuned in a communication‐ and compute-efficient manner. However, these methods typically rely on local prompt updates exchanged directly or via logit distillation, without fully exploiting the emergent in-context reasoning ability of FMs or addressing how to build a compact, universal prompt library that captures global domain diversity.  

Research Objectives  
We propose FICPD (Federated In-Context Prompt Distillation), a novel FL framework to collaboratively learn and distill soft prompt vectors across heterogeneous clients while providing rigorous privacy guarantees. Our objectives are:  
• Enable clients to fine-tune private soft prompts locally, never sharing raw data or full model weights.  
• Protect prompt updates with differential privacy (DP) and compression.  
• Aggregate diverse prompt vectors on the server into a set of domain prototypes.  
• Distill these prototypes into a compact universal prompt library using meta-distillation, which is broadcast back to clients for richer in-context reasoning.  
• Validate FICPD on multilingual and domain-specific benchmarks, measuring task accuracy, privacy leakage, and communication cost.  

Significance  
FICPD unifies advances in FL, prompt tuning, and meta-learning to address four core challenges: heterogeneity of data distributions, privacy preservation under regulatory constraints (e.g., GDPR), resource efficiency, and scalability to hundreds of participants. By shifting the focus from heavyweight weight updates to lightweight prompt vectors and prototype distillation, FICPD paves the way for practical deployment of federated foundation models in domains such as healthcare, finance, and multi-lingual services.  

2. Methodology  
Overview  
FICPD proceeds in T communication rounds. In each round, a subset of clients fine-tune local prompts on private data, sanitize and compress the updates, and send them to the server. The server clusters received prompt vectors into k prototypes, then meta-distills these into a universal prompt library of size k′. Clients download the updated library and integrate it for both inference and further local fine-tuning.  

2.1 Local Prompt Fine-Tuning & Sanitization  
•  Prompt Representation  
   Each client i maintains a soft prompt $P_i \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$, where m is the prompt length and d the embedding dimension. The foundation model’s frozen parameters are denoted by $\Theta$.  
•  Local Loss  
   Given local examples $\{(x_{i,j},y_{i,j})\}$, client i optimizes  
   $$\mathcal{L}_i(P_i)=\frac{1}{|D_i|}\sum_{j}\ell\bigl(f_{\Theta}(x_{i,j}\,|\,P_i),y_{i,j}\bigr)\,, $$  
   where $\ell(\cdot)$ is cross-entropy for classification or negative log-likelihood for generation.  
•  Update Computation  
   The client computes the prompt gradient:  
   $$\Delta P_i = -\eta\nabla_{P_i}\mathcal{L}_i(P_i)\,, $$  
   where $\eta$ is the local learning rate.  
•  Differential Privacy (Gaussian Mechanism)  
   To ensure $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP at each round, we clip and add noise to the update:  
   $$\bar\Delta P_i = \frac{\Delta P_i}{\max\bigl(1,\|\Delta P_i\|_F/C\bigr)}\,,\qquad  
     \widetilde{\Delta P}_i = \bar\Delta P_i + \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 C^2 I)\,, $$  
   where $C$ is the clipping norm and $\sigma$ is calibrated to $(\epsilon,\delta)$ via the Gaussian accountant.  
•  Compression  
   To reduce communication, $\widetilde{\Delta P}_i$ is quantized (e.g., 8-bit or randomized ternary) before upload.  

2.2 Server-Side Clustering of Prompt Prototypes  
After receiving sanitized updates from a set $\mathcal{S}_t$ of clients, the server reconstructs prompt vectors  
$$P_i^{(t)} = P_i^{(t-1)} + \widetilde{\Delta P}_i\quad\forall i\in\mathcal{S}_t$$  
and applies k-means clustering to $\{P_i^{(t)}\}$ to identify $k$ cluster centroids (prototypes) $\{U_1,\dots,U_k\}$:  
$$U_\ell = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}_\ell|}\sum_{i\in\mathcal{C}_\ell}P_i^{(t)}\,,\quad \ell=1,\dots,k.$$  
These prototypes capture diverse domain-specific prompt contexts.  

2.3 Meta-Distillation into Universal Prompt Library  
We seek a smaller library $L=\{L_1,\dots,L_{k'}\}$, $L_j\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$ with $k'\le k$, that distills the representative power of $\{U_\ell\}$. We use a meta-distillation objective: for each prototype $U_\ell$ sample a small public dataset $D_{\mathrm{pub},\ell}$ (or held-out validation data), and minimize the squared difference between the prototype’s and library prompts’ output distributions:  
$$\min_{L}\sum_{\ell=1}^{k}\sum_{(x,y)\in D_{\mathrm{pub},\ell}}\Big\|\sigma\bigl(f_{\Theta}(x\,|\,U_\ell)\bigr)-\sigma\bigl(f_{\Theta}(x\,|\,L_{j(\ell)})\bigr)\Big\|_2^2, $$  
where $j(\ell)=\arg\min_{j}\|U_\ell - L_j\|_F$ assigns each prototype to its nearest library prompt, and $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the softmax. We optimize this by alternating:  
1. Assignment step: $j(\ell)\leftarrow\arg\min_j\|U_\ell-L_j\|_F$.  
2. Update step:  
   $$L_j\leftarrow L_j - \gamma\,\nabla_{L_j}\sum_{\ell: j(\ell)=j}\sum_{(x,y)\in D_{\mathrm{pub},\ell}}\Big\|\sigma(f_{\Theta}(x\,|\,U_\ell))-\sigma(f_{\Theta}(x\,|\,L_j))\Big\|^2_2$$  
where $\gamma$ is the distillation learning rate.  

2.4 Client Integration  
The server broadcasts the distilled library $L$ to all clients. Each client augments its local prompt set by merging $L$ and optionally re-initializes its private prompts by sampling nearest library members. In subsequent rounds, clients may incorporate selected library prompts as in-context examples: given a new input $x$, they form the final prompt $\bigl[L_{j_1};\dots;L_{j_s};P_i\bigr]$ by concatenating the top-s library prompts closest in embedding space to $P_i$, followed by the private prompt.  

2.5 Experimental Design  
Datasets & Tasks  
•  Multilingual summarization: XSum in 10 languages split non-IID across clients.  
•  Domain-specific classification: Legal (LEDGAR), medical (MedNLI), financial sentiment (FiQA).  
Client Simulation  
Simulate $N=100$ clients with non-IID splits; each round selects $m=20$ clients.  
Baselines  
•  Centralized prompt tuning (no privacy, aggregated data).  
•  FedHPL [1], FedBPT [2], FedDTPT [4].  
•  FedPepTAO [5].  
Metrics  
•  Task performance: accuracy, F1, ROUGE.  
•  Privacy leakage: membership inference attack success rate.  
•  Communication cost: average bits sent per client per round.  
•  Convergence speed: rounds to reach 95% of peak performance.  

Hyperparameters  
•  Prompt length $m=10$, embedding dim. $d=768$.  
•  Local learning rate $\eta=1e\!-\!3$, distillation rate $\gamma=5e\!-\!4$.  
•  DP parameters: $(\epsilon=1,\delta=10^{-5})$, clipping norm $C=1.0$.  
Implementation  
Based on PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers; experiments run on NVIDIA A100 GPUs.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Expected Outcomes  
•  Accuracy & Generalization: FICPD will match or exceed centralized prompt tuning performance on multilingual and domain-specific benchmarks, narrowing the gap created by data heterogeneity.  
•  Privacy Guarantees: Each round will satisfy $(\epsilon=1,\delta=10^{-5})$-DP, with membership inference attack success reduced to near random.  
•  Communication Efficiency: By exchanging only small prompt updates (m×d floats) and distilled libraries, FICPD will require orders of magnitude less bandwidth than full-model FL.  
•  Scalability & Convergence: Clustering and meta-distillation will enable robust convergence in under 200 rounds even with 100 heterogeneous clients.  

Impact  
FICPD advances the frontier of federated foundation models by:  
•  Demonstrating that in-context prompt adaptation can be federated with rigorous privacy.  
•  Introducing a novel prototype–library meta-distillation pipeline for capturing global domain diversity.  
•  Enabling resource-constrained clients to benefit from large FMs without centralizing data or models.  
In regulated domains (healthcare, finance), FICPD offers a pathway to deploy LLMs on private data under GDPR and HIPAA constraints. Its modular design can be extended to other modalities (vision, audio), fostering broad adoption in edge and cross-silo settings.  

4. Conclusion and Future Work  
We have presented FICPD, a federated in-context prompt distillation framework that marries privacy-preserving FL, prompt tuning, and meta-distillation to build a compact universal prompt library. By protecting local updates with differential privacy, clustering domain-specific prototypes, and distilling them into a shared library, FICPD enables collaborative prompt adaptation across hundreds of clients. Future work includes hierarchical clustering for dynamic client grouping, adaptive DP budget allocation, and extending FICPD to multimodal foundation models and adversarial robustness in open federated environments.
