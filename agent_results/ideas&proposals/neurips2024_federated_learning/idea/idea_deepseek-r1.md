**Title:** Parameter-Efficient Federated Transfer Learning for Scalable Foundation Model Adaptation  

**Motivation:** Foundation models (FMs) like GPT-4 require domain-specific grounding to unlock their potential in sensitive, distributed applications (e.g., healthcare, finance). However, adapting such models via federated transfer learning (FTL) faces critical challenges: computational bottlenecks from fine-tuning giant models on edge devices, data heterogeneity across clients, and privacy risks from parameter leakage during federated updates. Existing FTL approaches struggle to balance efficiency, scalability, and security.  

**Main Idea:** This work proposes a novel *split-adapter* framework for FTL, enabling resource-efficient, privacy-preserving FM adaptation. The approach decouples a frozen FM into a shared global base (hosted on a central server) and lightweight, task-specific adapter modules trained locally on clients. Adapters leverage parameter-efficient techniques (e.g., LoRA) to minimize computation and communication costs. To mitigate data heterogeneity, a dynamic adapter gating mechanism selects or combines client-specific adapter parameters based on local data distribution, allowing personalized model behavior without exposing raw data. Secure aggregation and differential privacy further protect adapter updates. Expected outcomes include 1) a 10x reduction in communication overhead compared to full FM fine-tuning, 2) robust adaptation to heterogeneous client data, and 3) formal privacy guarantees. This framework could democratize FM customization for edge devices, enabling scalable federated applications while preserving data sovereignty.
