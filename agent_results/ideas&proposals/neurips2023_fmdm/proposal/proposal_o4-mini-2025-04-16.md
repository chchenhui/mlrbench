Title  
Sim2Act: Self-Supervised Action Data Generation for Multi-Modal Decision-Making Foundation Models  

1. Introduction  
1.1 Background  
Foundation models pretrained on large vision and language corpora have achieved state-of-the-art performance in understanding and generation tasks across modalities. However, when deployed for sequential decision-making—such as robotic manipulation, autonomous navigation, or interactive dialogue—these models lack the action-conditioned data and inductive biases necessary for planning and control. Traditional decision-making paradigms (reinforcement learning, imitation learning, planning, optimal control) require either task-specific reward engineering or extensive trial-and-error, leading to poor sample efficiency and limited generalization. Bridging the “action gap” between passive vision-language understanding and active control remains an open challenge.  

1.2 Objectives  
Sim2Act aims to close this gap by automatically generating large-scale paired triplets $(\text{observation},\ \text{language prompt},\ \text{action})$ in diverse simulated environments and using this synthetic corpus to fine-tune a vision-language foundation model augmented with an action-prediction head. Our key objectives are:  
• Design a self-supervised pipeline that (1) samples natural language task descriptions, (2) uses a base foundation model to propose exploratory policies in simulation, and (3) logs $(o_t, \ell,\ a_t)$ triplets.  
• Develop a multi-modal model architecture and training regime combining behavior cloning and contrastive representation learning, enabling the model to predict action distributions conditioned on visual and linguistic context.  
• Iterate the data-generation and model-fine-tuning loop to bootstrap increasingly complex behaviors and improve policy performance.  
• Evaluate sample efficiency, generalization to unseen tasks, and sim-to-real transfer on both simulated benchmarks and real robotic platforms.  

1.3 Significance  
By automatically constructing a large, diverse action-annotated dataset, Sim2Act leverages the breadth of foundation models while providing them with the inductive structure of control tasks. This hybrid approach promises:  
• Dramatically improved sample efficiency over pure RL from scratch.  
• Better zero- and few-shot generalization across tasks and environments.  
• A modular framework that can be extended to new modalities (e.g., force, language dialogues) or integrated with external tools (e.g., simulators, planners).  
• Insights into how large pretrained models can acquire actionable policies, informing theoretical understanding of multi-modal decision making.  

2. Methodology  
2.1 Overview of the Sim2Act Pipeline  
1. Task Sampling: Draw a batch of natural language instructions $\{\ell_i\}_{i=1}^N$ from a predefined distribution (e.g., “navigate to the red cube”, “stack the blue block on the green block”).  
2. Policy Proposal: Use a frozen vision-language foundation model $\pi_0(a\mid o,\ell)$ to sample exploratory actions in environment $\mathcal{E}$.  
3. Data Logging: For each time step $t$, record $(o_t,\ \ell,\ a_t)$, where $o_t$ is an RGB(D) observation, $\ell$ is the instruction, and $a_t$ is the executed action.  
4. Model Fine-Tuning: Train a multi-modal policy network $\pi_\theta$ on the collected dataset $\mathcal{D}=\{(o_i,\ell_i,a_i)\}$ via a combination of behavior cloning and contrastive learning.  
5. Iterative Bootstrapping: Replace $\pi_0$ with $\pi_\theta$, sample new trajectories, and augment the dataset. Repeat until performance converges.  

2.2 Simulated Environments & Task Suite  
We choose three representative domains to ensure diversity of dynamics and perception:  
– 3D Navigation (e.g., Habitat/AI2-Thor): Tasks require long-horizon planning, obstacle avoidance, and instruction following.  
– Robotic Manipulation (e.g., PyBullet, MuJoCo): Tasks involve grasping, stacking, tool use.  
– Grid-World Puzzles: Simplified environments for algorithmic reasoning and rapid iteration.  

Each environment exposes a unified API: at each time step $t$, the agent receives $o_t=(I_t, d_t)$, where $I_t$ is an RGB image and $d_t$ optional depth or proprioceptive readings, and executes a discrete or continuous action $a_t$.  

2.3 Model Architecture  
We build on a pretrained vision-language transformer encoder $E$ (e.g., CLIP or Vision-LLaMA):  
– Visual Encoder: $h_v = E_v(I)$ outputs a $d$-dimensional embedding.  
– Language Encoder: $h_\ell = E_\ell(\ell)$ outputs a $d$-dimensional embedding.  
We fuse modalities via cross-attention layers to produce a joint context representation $h_c$. An action-prediction head $f_a$ maps $h_c$ to an action distribution:  
$$\pi_\theta(a\mid o,\ell)\;=\;\mathrm{Softmax}\bigl(f_a(h_c)\bigr)\,.$$  

2.4 Training Objectives  
Let $\mathcal{D}=\{(o_i,\ell_i,a_i)\}_{i=1}^M$ be a mini-batch. We optimize:  
1. Behavior Cloning Loss:  
$$L_{BC}(\theta)\;=\;-\,\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M\log\pi_\theta\bigl(a_i\mid o_i,\ell_i\bigr)\,. $$  
2. Contrastive Representation Loss:  
We encourage $h_c^i$ to be close to an “action embedding” $h_a^i=f_a^\text{emb}(a_i)$ learned via a separate MLP. Using temperature $\tau$:  
$$L_{con}(\theta)\;=\;-\,\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M\log\frac{\exp\bigl(\mathrm{sim}(h_c^i,h_a^i)/\tau\bigr)}{\sum_{j=1}^M\exp\bigl(\mathrm{sim}(h_c^i,h_a^j)/\tau\bigr)}\,. $$  
The total loss is  
$$L(\theta)\;=\;L_{BC}(\theta)\;+\;\lambda\,L_{con}(\theta)\,, $$  
where $\lambda$ balances the two terms.  

2.5 Iterative Data Augmentation  
After training $\pi_\theta$ for $T$ epochs, we replace the base policy $\pi_0$ with $\pi_\theta$ to collect new trajectories. To promote diversity, we add an exploration bonus by sampling actions from a mixture:  
$$a_t\sim \alpha\,\pi_\theta(\cdot\mid o_t,\ell)\;+\;(1-\alpha)\,\text{UniformActions}()\,,$$  
with $\alpha\in[0.8,1.0]$. Collected data is added to $\mathcal{D}$, and fine-tuning continues. We iterate this loop until validation performance saturates.  

2.6 Experimental Design & Evaluation  
We compare Sim2Act against:  
• RL from Scratch (PPO / SAC) with reward engineering.  
• RLFP (Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Priors) [Ye et al., 2023].  
• Decision Stacks [Zhao & Grover, 2023].  

Benchmarks:  
– Sample Efficiency: Number of environment steps to reach 80% success rate on held-out tasks.  
– Zero-Shot Generalization: Success on unseen instructions and novel object configurations without fine-tuning.  
– Long-Horizon Planning: Average task length solved in navigation and stacking tasks.  
– Sim-to-Real Transfer: Deploy $\pi_\theta$ on a real robot arm (e.g., Franka Emika Panda) for pick-and-place tasks.  

Metrics:  
• Success Rate (%)  
• Cumulative Reward (simulated domains)  
• Task Completion Time  
• Behavioral Diversity (entropy over action sequences)  

Ablations:  
– Remove contrastive loss ($\lambda=0$).  
– Remove iterative augmentation (single pass).  
– Vary the mixture coefficient $\alpha$.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate that Sim2Act will:  
1. Significantly reduce sample complexity compared to RL from scratch and RLFP, by leveraging foundation priors and synthetic action data.  
2. Achieve strong zero- and few-shot generalization across tasks, surpassing purely simul-trained policies.  
3. Demonstrate robust sim-to-real transfer, closing the reality gap in robotic manipulation tasks.  
4. Provide insights into the role of contrastive multi-modal representations for action prediction and planning.  

Impact:  
• Foundation Extension: Enables pretrained vision-language models to acquire actionable policies without manual reward design.  
• Benchmark Contribution: We will release a large, annotated dataset of $(o,\ell,a)$ triplets, open-source code, and real-robot evaluation scripts.  
• Theoretical Insight: The combination of contrastive representation learning with behavior cloning may inform new algorithms bridging passive pretraining and active control.  
• Broader Adoption: Sim2Act’s modular design can integrate new sims, tasks, or modalities, accelerating research in generalist AI agents.  

In summary, Sim2Act offers a principled, scalable approach to endow foundation models with decision-making capabilities, charting a path toward sample-efficient, generalist, multi-modal agents capable of long-horizon planning and real-world control.
