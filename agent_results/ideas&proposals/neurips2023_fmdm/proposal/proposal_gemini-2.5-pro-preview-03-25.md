**1. Title:**

Sim2Act: Generating Actionable Data for Multi-Modal Decision Making via Self-Supervised Simulation

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
The rapid advancement of foundation models (FMs), particularly large vision-language models (VLMs), has revolutionized capabilities in natural language processing and computer vision (Yang et al., 2023). These models, pre-trained on vast, diverse datasets, exhibit remarkable zero-shot and few-shot generalization across a wide array of tasks. However, their deployment in real-world interactive scenarios, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and complex human-computer interaction, reveals a fundamental limitation: they are predominantly trained on passive, observational data (text and images) and lack inherent understanding of actions and their consequences within an environment. This "action gap" significantly hinders their direct application to sequential decision-making problems, which are core to intelligent agent behavior.

Sequential decision-making, traditionally addressed by fields like reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning (IL), planning, and control, focuses on learning policies that map states to actions to achieve specific goals. While these methods have achieved superhuman performance in specific domains (e.g., games, simulated robotics), they often suffer from poor sample efficiency and limited generalization, typically requiring extensive task-specific interaction data and struggling to leverage broader world knowledge (Yang et al., 2023).

Bridging the gap between the broad knowledge of FMs and the action-centric focus of decision-making algorithms presents a significant research opportunity. Recent efforts have explored using FMs as components within decision-making systems, for example, as reward models (Klissarov et al., 2024), high-level planners, or perception modules providing priors for RL (Ye et al., 2023). However, directly enabling FMs to generate low-level control actions remains challenging due to the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets pairing rich observations (vision, language) with corresponding actions. Manually collecting such datasets is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, especially for complex, long-horizon tasks across varied environments.

**2.2 Problem Statement**
The primary challenge addressed by this research is the lack of large-scale, action-annotated multi-modal datasets required to effectively train foundation models for sequential decision-making tasks. Existing FMs are trained on web-scale data largely devoid of explicit action labels grounded in physical or simulated environments. This prevents them from directly learning policies for control and planning, limiting their applicability in robotics and other interactive domains. While simulation offers a scalable environment for data generation, existing approaches often rely on expert demonstrations or hand-crafted reward functions, which are difficult to scale across diverse tasks and environments. There is a critical need for a method to automatically generate vast quantities of structured (observation, language instruction, action) data to imbue FMs with actionable understanding.

**2.3 Proposed Solution: Sim2Act**
We propose Sim2Act, a novel framework for generating large-scale, action-conditioned multi-modal datasets using self-supervised interaction within diverse simulated environments. Sim2Act leverages the inherent capabilities of existing foundation models for understanding and task decomposition, combined with the scalability and safety of simulation, to autonomously generate (visual observation, language instruction, executed action) triplets.

The core idea is an iterative bootstrapping process:
1.  **Task Generation:** Sample or generate natural language instructions describing diverse tasks within simulated environments (e.g., navigation, manipulation).
2.  **Exploratory Interaction:** Deploy a base foundation model (potentially prompted or minimally fine-tuned) to interpret the task instruction and propose an exploratory policy within the simulator.
3.  **Data Logging:** Record the trajectories generated by the agent, storing sequences of (visual frame $o_t$, language instruction $l$, executed action $a_t$).
4.  **Model Training:** Use the generated synthetic corpus to train or fine-tune a multi-modal model equipped with an action prediction head. Training employs a combination of supervised learning (behavior cloning on logged actions) and self-supervised objectives (e.g., contrastive learning) to improve robustness and representation quality.
5.  **Policy Improvement:** The newly trained model, now possessing improved action prediction capabilities, serves as the basis for the exploratory policy in the next iteration, enabling the generation of more complex and successful interaction data.

This iterative cycle allows Sim2Act to progressively generate richer, more complex datasets and learn increasingly sophisticated multi-task policies capable of handling long-horizon tasks, effectively closing the "action gap" for FMs in decision making.

**2.4 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop the Sim2Act Framework:** Design and implement the iterative pipeline for self-supervised action data generation in simulation, including task sampling, exploratory policy execution, data logging, and model training modules.
2.  **Generate a Large-Scale Action-Annotated Dataset:** Utilize the Sim2Act framework to create a substantial dataset (`Sim2Act-Data`) comprising millions of (visual observation, language instruction, action) triplets across diverse simulated environments and tasks.
3.  **Train Action-Aware Multi-Modal Models:** Train and evaluate multi-modal foundation models using `Sim2Act-Data`, focusing on their ability to perform language-conditioned control and planning.
4.  **Benchmark Performance:** Demonstrate the effectiveness of Sim2Act-trained models on standard downstream decision-making benchmarks (simulated robotics, navigation), comparing against relevant baselines (zero-shot FMs, RL/IL from scratch, models trained on human data).
5.  **Investigate Sample Efficiency and Generalization:** Analyze the sample efficiency gains achieved through Sim2Act compared to traditional methods and assess the generalization capabilities of the trained models to novel tasks and variations in simulated environments.
6.  **Explore Sim-to-Real Potential:** Conduct preliminary investigations into the transferability of Sim2Act-trained policies to real-world robotic platforms, identifying key challenges and potential mitigation strategies (addressing the challenge identified by Green & Black, 2024).

**2.5 Significance**
This research holds significant potential for advancing the field of foundation models for decision making. By providing a scalable method for generating action-conditioned data, Sim2Act directly addresses a critical bottleneck hindering the application of powerful FMs to interactive tasks. Successful outcomes will:

*   **Enhance FM Capabilities:** Enable FMs to perform complex planning and control tasks, moving beyond passive observation understanding.
*   **Improve Sample Efficiency:** Significantly reduce the need for expensive real-world interaction data or manual demonstrations for training decision-making agents.
*   **Promote Generalization:** Facilitate the training of generalist policies capable of handling multiple tasks across diverse environments, leveraging the broad knowledge base of FMs.
*   **Accelerate Robotics Research:** Provide researchers with large-scale datasets and pre-trained models, lowering the barrier to entry for developing capable robotic agents.
*   **Inform Future Architectures:** Contribute insights into effective architectures and training methodologies for multi-modal models that integrate perception, language understanding, and action generation (potentially informing modular designs like Decision Stacks, Zhao & Grover, 2023).

Ultimately, Sim2Act aims to bridge the divide between foundation models and sequential decision-making, paving the way for more intelligent, adaptable, and general-purpose autonomous agents.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework**
The Sim2Act framework operates through an iterative loop, graphically represented as:

[ Task Sampling -> Exploratory Policy -> Simulation Interaction -> Data Logging ] -> [ Model Training (BC + Contrastive) -> Improved Policy ] -> [ Loop back ]

Each iteration consists of a data generation phase followed by a model training phase, yielding an improved policy for the subsequent data generation phase.

**3.2 Data Generation Phase**

*   **Simulated Environments:** We will leverage multiple state-of-the-art simulators to ensure diversity in tasks, dynamics, and visual appearance. Potential candidates include:
    *   **Habitat:** For navigation and embodied AI tasks.
    *   **Isaac Gym / Nvidia Omniverse:** For parallelized robotic manipulation tasks with realistic physics and rendering.
    *   **AI2-THOR:** For interactive object manipulation in household environments.
    *   **CARLA / MetaDrive:** For autonomous driving scenarios (if applicable to target tasks).
    The choice will prioritize simulators offering Python APIs, diverse assets, procedural generation capabilities, and efficient rendering.

*   **Task Sampling:** Natural language instructions ($l$) will be generated using various strategies:
    *   **Template-based generation:** Creating structured templates like "Go to the $object$", "Pick up the $object_1$ and place it on the $object_2$".
    *   **LLM-based generation:** Using a large language model (e.g., GPT-4) prompted to generate feasible and diverse task descriptions relevant to the simulated environment.
    *   **Goal sampling:** Programmatically sampling initial and goal states (e.g., target object poses, navigation waypoints) and potentially generating corresponding language descriptions.

*   **Exploratory Policy ($\pi_{explore}$):** In the initial iteration ($i=0$), the exploratory policy will be based on a pre-trained VLM (e.g., CLIP, Flamingo variants) combined with simple heuristics or a zero-shot prompting approach. For example, the VLM might be prompted with the current visual observation ($o_t$) and language instruction ($l$) to output a textual description of the next action, which is then mapped to the simulator's action Espace. Alternatively, a basic RL algorithm (e.g., PPO) with simple reward shaping could be used initially. In subsequent iterations ($i>0$), the exploratory policy $\pi_{explore}^{(i)}$ will be derived from the model trained in the previous iteration, $\pi_{Sim2Act}^{(i-1)}$. This could involve using $\pi_{Sim2Act}^{(i-1)}$ directly or using its outputs (e.g., value estimates or action probabilities) to guide exploration more effectively (e.g., epsilon-greedy exploration or using model uncertainty).

*   **Simulation Interaction & Data Logging:** The agent, controlled by $\pi_{explore}$, interacts with the simulator based on the sampled task $l$. During each episode (or interaction step), we log the relevant data. A single data point will typically be a triplet $(o_t, l, a_t)$, where $o_t$ is the visual observation (e.g., RGB image, potentially depth), $l$ is the language instruction for the entire task, and $a_t$ is the low-level action executed by the simulator's agent at time $t$. We may also log proprioceptive state ($s_t$) if applicable (e.g., joint angles for robot arms). The logged data across multiple iterations forms the growing Sim2Act dataset $\mathcal{D} = \bigcup_i \mathcal{D}^{(i)}$.

**3.3 Model Architecture**
We will design a multi-modal model capable of processing visual and language inputs to predict actions.

*   **Vision Encoder ($f_{vis}$):** A standard pre-trained vision backbone (e.g., ViT, ResNet) will process the visual observation $o_t$.
*   **Language Encoder ($f_{lang}$):** A pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, T5, or the language component of a VLM) will process the language instruction $l$.
*   **Fusion Module:** A mechanism (e.g., cross-attention, concatenation followed by MLP) will fuse the encoded visual features $z_{vis} = f_{vis}(o_t)$ and language features $z_{lang} = f_{lang}(l)$ into a joint representation $z_{fused}$.
*   **Action Head ($f_{act}$):** An action prediction module will take the fused representation $z_{fused}$ (and potentially historical context or state $s_t$) as input and output a distribution over the action space $\mathcal{A}$. For continuous actions (e.g., robot end-effector velocities), this could be a regression head predicting parameters of a distribution (e.g., mean and variance of a Gaussian). For discrete actions (e.g., navigation commands), this will be a classification head outputting probabilities. The model parameters are denoted by $\theta$. The predicted action distribution is $P(a_t | o_t, l; \theta)$.

**3.4 Training Procedure**
The model will be trained on the aggregated Sim2Act dataset $\mathcal{D}$ using a combined loss function $L_{total}$:

$$
L_{total} = \alpha L_{BC} + \beta L_{Contra}
$$

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are hyperparameters balancing the two loss components.

*   **Behavior Cloning Loss ($L_{BC}$):** This supervised loss encourages the model to mimic the actions logged during the exploratory interactions.
    $$
    L_{BC} = -\frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}|} \sum_{(o_t, l, a_t) \in \mathcal{D}} \log P(a_t | o_t, l; \theta)
    $$
    This directly leverages the generated action labels.

*   **Contrastive Learning Loss ($L_{Contra}$):** Inspired by recent work in representation learning for robotics and multi-modal data (Doe & Smith, 2023; Johnson & Lee, 2023; Blue & Red, 2024), we incorporate a contrastive loss to learn more robust and meaningful representations. One possible formulation aims to align the fused observation-language representation with the corresponding action representation, distinguishing it from negative actions. Let $g_{act}$ be an action encoder.
    $$
    L_{Contra} = -\mathbb{E}_{(o_t, l, a_t) \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_{fused}, g_{act}(a_t)) / \tau)}{\sum_{a' \in \mathcal{A}_{neg} \cup \{a_t\}} \exp(\text{sim}(z_{fused}, g_{act}(a')) / \tau)} \right]
    $$
    Here, $\text{sim}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity), $\tau$ is a temperature hyperparameter, and $\mathcal{A}_{neg}$ is a set of negative action samples (e.g., randomly sampled actions from other state-instruction pairs in the batch, or actions from the simulator's action space). This encourages the model to learn representations sensitive to the specific action required by the context (observation and language prompt), similar to principles in contrastive predictive coding. Alternative contrastive objectives could align future states with actions or contrast successful trajectories with failed ones if outcome information is logged.

**3.5 Iterative Refinement**
After training the model $\pi_{Sim2Act}^{(i)}$ on the data $\mathcal{D}^{(i)}$ (potentially aggregated with data from previous iterations), this improved policy is used to seed the exploration in the next data generation phase ($i+1$). This creates a positive feedback loop where better policies lead to the collection of more successful and complex interaction data, which in turn leads to even better policies. This resembles ideas from self-training or policy iteration in RL, but adapted to the context of large-scale data generation for supervised/self-supervised learning.

**3.6 Experimental Design**

*   **Dataset:** We will generate and potentially release the `Sim2Act-Data` dataset, detailing its size, task distribution, and environment diversity.
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **Zero-Shot FM:** A pre-trained VLM prompted to output actions textually, mapped to simulator actions (e.g., using GPT-4V or similar).
    2.  **BC on Human Data:** Train the same model architecture using Behavior Cloning on existing, smaller-scale human demonstration datasets (e.g., subsets of RT-1 data adapted to simulation).
    3.  **RL from Scratch:** Train standard RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC) with shaped rewards in the simulators (to assess sample efficiency).
    4.  **Sim2Act (BC Only):** An ablation study training our model only with the $L_{BC}$ loss on `Sim2Act-Data`.
    5.  **Sim2Act (Full):** Our proposed method using $L_{BC} + L_{Contra}$.
*   **Evaluation Tasks:** We will evaluate models on held-out tasks within the training simulators and potentially slightly different, unseen simulated environments to test generalization. Tasks will include:
    *   **Language-Conditioned Navigation:** e.g., "Go to the red chair" in Habitat or AI2-THOR.
    *   **Language-Conditioned Manipulation:** e.g., "Push the blue block to the green region," "Pick up the apple," in Isaac Gym or RLBench (simulated).
    *   **Long-Horizon Tasks:** Sequences of instructions or complex goals requiring multiple steps.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Success Rate (SR) / Goal Completion Rate (GCR):** Percentage of tasks completed successfully.
    *   **Spline Path Length (SPL):** For navigation tasks, measuring efficiency relative to the optimal path.
    *   **Sample Efficiency:** Number of environment interactions or data points required to reach a target performance level. Compared primarily against RL from Scratch and BC on Human Data.
    *   **Generalization:** Performance on unseen tasks, objects, or environments.
*   **Sim-to-Real Transfer:** As a stretch goal, we plan preliminary experiments transferring a policy trained using Sim2Act in simulation (e.g., Isaac Gym) to a corresponding real-world robot (e.g., Franka Emika Panda arm) for a simple manipulation task. This will involve domain randomization during simulation training and potentially minimal fine-tuning on the real robot, aiming to assess the feasibility and challenges (Green & Black, 2024).
