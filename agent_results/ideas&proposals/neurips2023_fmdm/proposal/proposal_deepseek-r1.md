**Sim2Act: Self-Supervised Action Data Generation for Multi-Modal Decision Making Models**

---

**2. Introduction**  
**Background**  
Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionised vision and language understanding, yet their application to sequential decision-making tasks—such as robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI—remains constrained by a critical limitation: the absence of *action-conditioned data* in pretraining corpora. While FMs excel at reasoning over static vision-language inputs, they struggle to infer actionable strategies for dynamic environments due to the gap between passive observation data (images, text) and actionable outputs (control signals, trajectories). Recent work (Yang et al., 2023; Klissarov et al., 2024) underscores the potential of leveraging FMs for decision-making through prompting, reward modeling, and modular policy design. However, these approaches still rely on task-specific fine-tuning with limited interaction data, which hampers generalization and scalability.  

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal introduces **Sim2Act**, a framework to address the "actions gap" in FMs by automatically generating large-scale, multi-modal (vision, language, action) datasets through self-supervised interactions in simulated environments. Key objectives include:  
1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Use diverse simulated tasks (e.g., robotic manipulation, navigation) to produce (observation, language, action) triplets via foundation model-guided exploration.  
2. **Multi-Modal Policy Training**: Train a vision-language-action FM using contrastive learning and behavior cloning on synthetic data to predict actions conditioned on observations and language goals.  
3. **Iterative Policy Improvement**: Bootstrap increasingly complex behaviors by deploying refined policies back into simulation, enabling long-horizon task performance.  
4. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Validate the approach in real-world robotic tasks, bridging the gap between simulation and physical deployment.  

**Significance**  
Sim2Act aims to transform how FMs integrate action-oriented reasoning by:  
- Enabling **sample-efficient adaptation** of FMs to decision-making tasks with minimal real-world data.  
- Providing a **scalable, cost-effective pipeline** for generating diverse action-annotated datasets.  
- Advancing the development of **generalist embodied agents** capable of long-horizon planning and control across modalities.

**3. Methodology**  
**3.1 Data Generation in Simulated Environments**  
- **Task Sampling**: Generate diverse language-described tasks (e.g., "Pick up the blue block") using a large language model (LLM) conditioned on environment metadata (object types, layouts).  
- **Foundation Model-Guided Exploration**: Deploy a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) as an exploratory agent. For each task, the VLM receives a visual observation $o_t$ and language prompt $l$, then proposes an action $a_t$ (e.g., motor commands, discrete navigation steps) via zero-shot prompting.  
- **Interaction Logging**: Record trajectories as tuples $(o_t, l, a_t, o_{t+1})$ across multiple environments (Habitat, AI2-THOR, MuJoCo) and tasks.  

**3.2 Model Architecture and Training**  
- **Encoder Modules**:  
  - **Vision Encoder**: A Vision Transformer (ViT) processes RGB-D frames into embeddings $z_o \in \mathbb{R}^d$.  
  - **Language Encoder**: A pretrained LLM (e.g., GPT-3) encodes task prompts into embeddings $z_l \in \mathbb{R}^d$.  
- **Fusion and Action Prediction**: A cross-modal transformer fuses $z_o$ and $z_l$ to produce a joint embedding $z_{ol}$, which feeds into an action-prediction head:  
  - Discrete actions: Softmax classifier over $N$ actions.  
  - Continuous actions: Multivariate Gaussian policy $\pi(a|z_{ol}) = \mathcal{N}(\mu(z_{ol}), \Sigma(z_{ol}))$.  
- **Loss Functions**:  
  - **Contrastive Loss**: Align vision and language embeddings with actions via InfoNCE:  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{cont}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_{ol}^+, z_a^+) / \tau)}{\sum_{i=1}^B \exp(\text{sim}(z_{ol}^i, z_a^i) / \tau)},
  $$  
  where $z_a$ are action embeddings and $\tau$ is temperature.  
  - **Behavior Cloning Loss**: Supervised regression for action prediction:  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{bc}} = \mathbb{E}_{(o, l, a)} \left[ \| \pi_{\theta}(o, l) - a \|^2 \right].
  $$  
  Total loss: $\mathcal{L} = \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{cont}} + (1-\lambda)\mathcal{L}_{\text{bc}}$.  

**3.3 Iterative Policy Improvement**  
1. **Initial Training**: Train the model on the initial synthetic dataset.  
2. **Policy Deployment**: Use the trained model to generate new trajectories, prioritizing under-explored tasks identified via uncertainty quantification.  
3. **Dataset Aggregation**: Augment the training set with new trajectories, applying rejection sampling to filter low-reward episodes.  

**3.4 Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against:  
  - RL from scratch (PPO, SAC).  
  - Foundation models fine-tuned without Sim2Act data (e.g., CLIPort).  
  - Prior synthetic data methods (Ye et al., 2023; White & Brown, 2023).  
- **Tasks**:  
  - **Simulation**: Object manipulation, multi-room navigation, long-horizon assembly.  
  - **Real-World**: Robotic pick-and-place, autonomous drone navigation.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Success Rate**: Task completion %.  
  - **Sample Efficiency**: Number of real-world episodes needed to reach 80% success.  
  - **Generalization**: Performance on unseen tasks/environments.  

**3.5 Sim-to-Real Transfer**  
Apply domain randomization (object textures, lighting) during simulation and use progressive networks to adapt embeddings to real-world sensor data (RGB cameras, LiDAR). Validate on a UR5 robotic arm and Boston Dynamics Spot.
