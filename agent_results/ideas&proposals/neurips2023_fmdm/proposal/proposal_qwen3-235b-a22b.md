# Sim2Act: Self-Supervised Action Data Generation for Multi-Modal Decision Making Models

## Introduction

### Background  
Foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language datasets have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks ranging from image captioning to dialogue systems. However, their application to sequential decision-making tasks—such as robotic control, autonomous navigation, and long-horizon planning—remains limited due to a critical gap: the absence of **action-conditioned data** during pretraining. Traditional foundation models are trained on static datasets of text and images, which lack the temporal and causal structure required for learning policies that map observations to actions. In contrast, sequential decision-making frameworks like reinforcement learning (RL) excel at learning action-value functions but struggle with sample efficiency and generalization due to their reliance on task-specific training from scratch.  

Recent efforts to bridge this divide include methods like RLFP (Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Priors) and Decision Stacks, which integrate foundation models into RL pipelines or modular policy architectures. While promising, these approaches often require extensive manual reward engineering or suffer from limited generalization across tasks. Meanwhile, self-supervised techniques such as contrastive predictive coding and multi-modal sensor fusion have shown success in learning actionable representations but remain constrained to narrow domains. A key open challenge is the **systematic generation of large-scale, multi-modal datasets** that pair observations (e.g., visual frames), language (e.g., task instructions), and actions (e.g., motor commands) to enable foundation models to learn decision-making policies in a sample-efficient manner.  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal introduces **Sim2Act**, a framework for self-supervised action data generation that leverages simulated environments to create diverse, high-quality (observation, language, action) triplets. The primary objectives are:  
1. **Automated Dataset Generation**: Develop a pipeline to synthesize multi-modal datasets in 3D simulated environments (e.g., robotic manipulation, navigation arenas) by combining language-driven exploration and foundation model-based policy execution.  
2. **Multi-Modal Policy Learning**: Train a vision-language-action model (VLAM) augmented with an action-prediction head using contrastive learning and behavior cloning, enabling generalization across tasks and modalities.  
3. **Iterative Bootstrapping**: Improve policy performance through cycles of simulation interaction and dataset refinement, enabling long-horizon planning and complex task execution.  
4. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Validate the applicability of Sim2Act-trained models in real-world robotic tasks, addressing the sim-to-reality gap through domain adaptation techniques.  

### Significance  
Sim2Act addresses three critical challenges in decision-making research:  
- **Data Scarcity**: By automating the generation of action-annotated datasets, Sim2Act reduces reliance on laborious manual labeling while enabling large-scale training.  
- **Sample Efficiency**: The integration of foundation models with RL-style exploration allows policies to learn from fewer interactions, critical for real-world deployment.  
- **Generalization**: Multi-modal contrastive learning ensures robust alignment between vision, language, and actions, enabling transfer to unseen tasks and environments.  

Success in this work would advance applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and embodied AI, where long-horizon planning and cross-modal reasoning are essential.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection Pipeline  
Sim2Act generates datasets through a three-stage process in simulated environments (Figure 1):  

#### 1.1 Language-Driven Task Sampling  
We sample natural language task descriptions from a diverse set of templates (e.g., *"Pick up the red cup and place it on the shelf"*). Tasks are categorized into navigation, object manipulation, and multi-step planning, ensuring coverage of short- and long-horizon behaviors.  

#### 1.2 Policy Execution in Simulation  
A pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), such as CLIP or Flamingo, is augmented with a lightweight action head to form an initial policy $\pi_0(o_t | s)$, where $o_t$ is the observation at time $t$ and $s$ is the task prompt. The policy interacts with a 3D simulator (e.g., Unity ML-Agents, PyBullet) to execute tasks, logging trajectories $\tau = \{(o_1, s, a_1), (o_2, s, a_2), \dots, (o_T, s, a_T)\}$, where $a_t$ is the executed action.  

#### 1.3 Data Curation  
Trajectories are filtered using a confidence score $C(\tau)$ based on task completion signals (e.g., object grasping success) and linguistic consistency between $s$ and executed actions. This ensures high-quality supervision for downstream training.

### 2. Model Architecture  
The Sim2Act model extends a pre-trained VLM with components for action prediction and temporal reasoning:  

#### 2.1 Vision-Language Encoder  
Let $o_t$ be a visual observation (RGB image or LiDAR) and $s$ the task prompt. The encoder maps these to joint embeddings:  
$$
z_t = \text{Encoder}([o_t; s]) \in \mathbb{R}^d
$$
where $[;]$ denotes concatenation.  

#### 2.2 Action Prediction Head  
A transformer-based decoder autoregressively predicts actions given the history $\{z_1, \dots, z_t\}$:  
$$
a_t \sim \text{Softmax}(W_a \cdot \text{Transformer}(z_{1:t}))
$$
where $W_a$ is a learnable projection matrix.  

#### 2.3 Contrastive Learning Module  
To align multi-modal representations, we maximize the agreement between positive (observation, action) pairs and minimize it for negatives using the InfoNCE loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} = -\log \frac{\exp(z_t^+ \cdot z_a / \tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^K \exp(z_t^k \cdot z_a / \tau)}
$$
where $z_t^+$ is a positive sample (same trajectory), $z_t^k$ are $K$ negatives, and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.  

#### 2.4 Behavior Cloning Objective  
Actions are supervised via cross-entropy loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{BC}} = -\sum_{t=1}^T \log p(a_t | z_{1:t})
$$
Combining both losses:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} + (1-\alpha) \mathcal{L}_{\text{BC}}
$$
where $\alpha$ balances the two terms.

### 3. Iterative Bootstrapping  
To scale to complex tasks, we employ a curriculum learning strategy:  
1. **Phase 1**: Train $\pi_0$ on simple tasks (e.g., object reaching) and generate a seed dataset $\mathcal{D}_0$.  
2. **Phase 2**: Fine-tune the VLM on $\mathcal{D}_0$ to obtain $\pi_1$, which tackles harder tasks (e.g., multi-object manipulation).  
3. **Phase 3**: Repeat until task complexity plateaus.  

This bootstrapping ensures policies learn robust representations while avoiding local optima.

- **Loss Components**: Compare $\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}}$ variants (e.g., contrastive-only, BC-only).
