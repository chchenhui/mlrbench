### Title: "Enhancing Foundation Models for Human-AI Interaction in Sequential Decision Making"

### Motivation:
The integration of foundation models into decision-making systems, particularly in human-AI interaction, presents both challenges and opportunities. Current methods struggle with real-time adaptation, long-term reasoning, and effective communication with humans. Addressing these issues can significantly improve the usability, efficiency, and effectiveness of AI systems in various applications, such as healthcare, autonomous driving, and robotics.

### Main Idea:
To enhance foundation models for human-AI interaction in sequential decision-making, we propose a hybrid approach combining reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and foundation models. This approach involves:

1. **Human Feedback Integration**: Develop algorithms that allow foundation models to learn from human feedback in real-time, adapting to user preferences and behavior dynamically.
2. **Long-Horizon Reasoning**: Implement techniques to enable long-term reasoning and planning within foundation models, allowing them to make decisions based on cumulative information and future states.
3. **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Design models that can effectively interact with humans using multiple modalities, such as text, speech, and vision, enhancing the naturalness and effectiveness of communication.
4. **Evaluation and Benchmarks**: Create new evaluation protocols and datasets to assess the performance of foundation models in human-AI interaction, focusing on metrics like user satisfaction, task completion rates, and generalization across different scenarios.

Expected outcomes include more adaptive, efficient, and user-friendly AI systems that can better assist humans in decision-making processes. This research has the potential to revolutionize various industries by making AI systems more interactive, capable, and reliable.
