# Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Language Model Latent Spaces

## Motivation
Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches struggle with long-horizon planning and exploration in complex environments, often requiring enormous amounts of interaction data. Meanwhile, foundation models contain rich semantic knowledge but lack structured decision-making capabilities. This research aims to bridge this gap by leveraging the semantic understanding of large language models (LLMs) to create meaningful abstractions for hierarchical reinforcement learning, enabling more efficient exploration and planning in complex environments while reducing the sample complexity that plagues traditional RL approaches.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework where an LLM generates high-level actions in its latent space, which are then translated into executable low-level actions by specialized policies. The system operates on multiple time scales: the LLM-based high-level controller plans in abstract semantic space (e.g., "navigate to kitchen," "pick up knife"), while domain-specific low-level controllers execute these directives through primitive actions. The key innovation is a bidirectional translation mechanism that maps between the LLM's semantic space and the environment's action space, learned through contrastive learning on paired demonstrations. This approach enables complex sequential decision-making while leveraging the LLM's world knowledge and reasoning abilities. We will evaluate this framework on multi-task benchmarks like ALFWorld and RoboSuite, focusing on generalization to unseen tasks and sample efficiency compared to conventional RL approaches.
