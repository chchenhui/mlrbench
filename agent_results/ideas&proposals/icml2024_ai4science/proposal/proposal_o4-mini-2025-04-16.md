Title  
Symmetry‐Driven Adaptive Scaling of Foundation Models for Efficient and Interpretable Molecular Dynamics  

Introduction  
Background  
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized scientific discovery, enabling the modeling of complex systems, generation of hypotheses, and acceleration of experimentation. In molecular dynamics (MD), accurately predicting atomic motions and free‐energy landscapes is critical for drug design, materials discovery, and understanding fundamental chemical processes. Traditional MD force fields and small‐scale machine‐learned interatomic potentials excel in specific regimes but often suffer from limited transferability, high sample complexity, or lack of interpretability. Recent work on large “foundation” models in AI for science—pretrained on massive data, equipped with physical inductive biases, and capable of few‐shot adaptation—promises to push the methodology–interpretability–discovery Pareto frontier. However, naïvely scaling transformer‐style architectures to MD tasks is computationally prohibitive and may overlook essential physical symmetries (translational, rotational, and permutation invariance).  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a three‐stage pipeline—Symmetry‐Driven Adaptive Scaling (SDAS)—for foundation models in molecular dynamics. Our specific objectives are:  
1. To design a transformer‐style architecture with group‐equivariant attention layers, guaranteeing exact enforcement of SE(3)/E(3) symmetries and atom‐permutation invariance.  
2. To formulate physics‐informed scaling laws that dynamically allocate computation and data as model performance saturates, maximizing accuracy‐per‐FLOP.  
3. To integrate active sampling with uncertainty quantification, identifying underrepresented chemical motifs, generating targeted high‐fidelity data, and iteratively fine‐tuning the foundation model.  

Significance  
By embedding symmetries at the core of the architecture and adaptively scaling model and data, we anticipate a two‐fold improvement in accuracy‐per‐FLOP over state‐of‐the‐art MD models (e.g. NequIP, Equiformer, Allegro). This work will yield an interpretable, cost‐efficient, and high‐throughput framework for drug discovery and materials design. Moreover, the SDAS pipeline generalizes to other domains in AI for science where scaling and physical priors are critical.  

Methodology  
We organize the SDAS pipeline into four components: (1) Data Collection & Preprocessing, (2) Equivariant Transformer Architecture, (3) Physics‐Informed Adaptive Scaling, and (4) Active Sampling & Fine‐Tuning.  

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing  
– Initial Dataset: We draw on large‐scale simulated MD trajectories from public repositories (e.g. Open Catalyst Project (OCP), MD17) and augment with our custom simulations of small proteins and drug‐like molecules.  
– Data Representation: Each configuration is represented as an atomistic graph $G=(V,E)$, where $V = \{i\}$ are nodes with atomic numbers $Z_i$ and $E=\{(i,j)\}$ are edges with relative displacement vectors $r_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}^3$. We compute pairwise distances $d_{ij} = \|r_{ij}\|$ and directional features via spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell m}(\widehat{r}_{ij})$.  
– Splitting: We partition data into train/validation/test splits, ensuring no overlap of molecular compositions between sets to evaluate out‐of‐distribution generalization.  

2. Equivariant Transformer Architecture  
We propose a transformer backbone where each self‐attention layer is SE(3)/E(3)‐equivariant and permutation‐invariant.  

2.1 Node Embeddings  
Initialize scalar features $h_i^{(0)} = \mathrm{EmbedAtom}(Z_i)$ and geometric features $x_{i\ell m}^{(0)} = \sum_{j\ne i} w(d_{ij})\,Y_{\ell m}(\widehat{r}_{ij})$, for $\ell = 0,\dots,L$.  

2.2 Equivariant Self‐Attention  
At layer $l$, we compute multi‐head attention over neighbors. For each head $k$:  
– Compute queries and keys as irreducible tensors  
$$
Q_{i}^{(k,l)} = W_{Q}^{(k,l)}\,h_i^{(l)},\quad
K_{j}^{(k,l)} = W_{K}^{(k,l)}\,h_j^{(l)}.
$$  
– Construct geometric bias using tensor products of spherical harmonics:  
$$
B_{ij}^{(k,l)} = \sum_{\ell,m} U_{\ell}^{(k,l)} \, x_{i\ell m}^{(l)} \, Y_{\ell m}(\widehat{r}_{ij}).
$$  
– Compute attention scores and weights (invariant under global rotations and translations):  
$$
e_{ij}^{(k,l)} = Q_i^{(k,l)\top}K_j^{(k,l)} + B_{ij}^{(k,l)},\quad
\alpha_{ij}^{(k,l)} = \frac{\exp(e_{ij}^{(k,l)})}{\sum_{j'\in \mathcal{N}(i)}\exp(e_{ij'}^{(k,l)})}.
$$  
– Update scalar and geometric features:  
$$
h_i^{(l+1)} = h_i^{(l)} + \sum_{k}\sum_{j\in \mathcal{N}(i)} \alpha_{ij}^{(k,l)}\,V^{(k,l)}\,h_j^{(l)},  
$$  
$$
x_{i\ell m}^{(l+1)} = x_{i\ell m}^{(l)} + \sum_{k}\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)} \alpha_{ij}^{(k,l)}\,W_{\ell}^{(k,l)}\,\bigl(x_{j\ell m}^{(l)}\otimes Y_{\ell m}(\widehat{r}_{ij})\bigr).
$$  
All tensor operations preserve equivariance by construction (e.g. via Clebsch–Gordan projections).  

2.3 Output Heads & Loss  
We attach two readouts:  
– Energy head:  
$$
E_{\mathrm{pred}}(G) = \sum_{i} f_E\bigl(h_i^{(L)}\bigr),  
$$  
– Force head via negative gradient:  
$$
F_{\mathrm{pred},i} = -\nabla_{r_i} E_{\mathrm{pred}}(G).  
$$  
We train with the combined loss  
$$
\mathcal{L} = \lambda_E \|E_{\mathrm{pred}}-E_{\mathrm{true}}\|_2^2 + \lambda_F \sum_i\|F_{\mathrm{pred},i}-F_{\mathrm{true},i}\|_2^2,  
$$  
with hyperparameters $\lambda_E,\lambda_F$ set by cross‐validation.  

3. Physics‐Informed Adaptive Scaling  
Training large models on massive data often yields diminishing returns. Inspired by recent scaling‐law studies [(Johnson & Brown, 2023)], we adopt a dynamic schedule to allocate capacity (model size) and data (trajectory length).  

3.1 Empirical Scaling Law  
We empirically fit validation MAE $E(C)$ as a function of compute $C$ (in FLOP$\times$steps) to  
$$
E(C) = E_\infty + A\,C^{-\alpha},  
$$  
where $E_\infty,A,\alpha$ are fitted parameters. Typical exponents in MD tasks satisfy $\alpha \approx 0.05\!-\!0.10$.  

3.2 Adaptive Rules  
During pretraining, every $\Delta C$ compute units we:  
1. Refit $E(C)$ and compute marginal gain $\Delta E/\Delta C$.  
2. If $\Delta E/\Delta C < \epsilon$ (a small threshold), trigger a scale‐up action:  
   – Increase model width $W \leftarrow k_W\,W$ and/or depth $D\leftarrow k_D\,D$.  
   – Augment data: extend simulation trajectories or sample new conformations to grow dataset size $N\leftarrow k_N\,N$.  
3. Reinitialize optimizer state and continue training.  

This physics‐informed policy guarantees we invest compute and data where they yield the highest accuracy gains.  

4. Active Sampling & Fine‐Tuning  
To further improve data efficiency and capture rare motifs, we implement an active learning loop with uncertainty quantification.  

4.1 Uncertainty Estimation  
We maintain an ensemble of $M$ SDAS models with different initialization seeds or adopt Monte Carlo dropout. For each unlabeled configuration $x$, we compute predictive variance  
$$
\sigma^2(x) = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M\bigl(f_m(x)-\bar f(x)\bigr)^2,\quad \bar f(x)=\tfrac1M\sum_m f_m(x).  
$$  
4.2 Selection & On‐Demand Simulation  
At each round $t=1,\dots,T$:  
1. Sample candidate configurations $\{x_j\}$ from a pool of coarse MD runs (e.g. inexpensive force fields).  
2. Rank by uncertainty $\sigma^2(x_j)$, select top $K$ configurations with highest $\sigma^2$.  
3. Perform high‐fidelity ab initio or DFT simulations to obtain ground‐truth $(E_{\mathrm{true}},F_{\mathrm{true}})$.  
4. Append new data to the training set and fine‐tune the SDAS model for $S$ steps with a reduced learning rate.  

Algorithm 1: Active Sampling Loop  
```
Input: Initial training set D₀, candidate pool P, ensemble size M  
for t in 1…T do  
  Train ensemble {f_m}_{m=1}^M on Dₜ₋₁ via adaptive scaling  
  For x∈P compute σ²(x)  
  Select top-K x* with highest σ²  
  Simulate high-fidelity labels (E*,F*) for x*  
  Dₜ = Dₜ₋₁ ∪ {(x*,E*,F*)}  
end for  
Output: Final model f  
```  

4.3 Experimental Validation  
We will benchmark SDAS against leading models (Equiformer, NequIP, Allegro, vanilla Transformer) on standard MD tasks:  
– MD17: small‐molecule force estimation (MAE$_E$, MAE$_F$).  
– Free‐energy estimation of conformational transitions (Wang–Landau sampling error).  
– Long‐timescale sampling: effective diffusion constant error.  
We will measure computational cost in GPU‐hours and report accuracy‐per‐FLOP ratio:  
$$
\mathrm{APR} = \frac{1/\mathrm{MAE}_F}{\mathrm{FLOPs}}.  
$$  
We will also evaluate interpretability by analyzing learned attention maps and equivariant features to recover known chemical bonds and reaction coordinates (cf. Red & Yellow, 2023).  

Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Anticipated Results  
1. Accuracy‐Per‐Compute Improvement: We expect a $2\times$ improvement in force MAE per PFLOP over state‐of‐the‐art E(3)‐equivariant models by virtue of symmetric attention and adaptive scaling.  
2. Data Efficiency: Through active sampling, we anticipate reducing the required high‐fidelity data by 30% while maintaining or improving accuracy.  
3. Interpretability: By enforcing symmetries explicitly, SDAS’s attention weights and tensor‐valued features will align with physical interactions (bonding, angular potentials), providing deeper scientific insights.  

Broader Impact  
– Cost‐Efficient Discovery: The pipeline will lower the computational barrier for high‐accuracy MD, benefiting academic labs and industry practitioners in drug and materials design.  
– Generality: While targeted at molecular dynamics, the SDAS methodology—equivariant transformers, physics‐informed scaling laws, and active sampling—is directly applicable to other AI‐for‐science domains such as climate modeling or fluid dynamics.  
– Open Science: We will release code, pretrained models, and datasets under a permissive open‐source license to accelerate community adoption and reproducibility.  

In summary, this research will deliver a scalable, interpretable, and cost‐effective foundation model framework for molecular dynamics, unlocking novel discoveries and guiding the next generation of AI‐enabled scientific exploration.
