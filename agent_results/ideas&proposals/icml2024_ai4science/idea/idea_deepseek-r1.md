**Title:** Scaling with Clarity: Intrinsically Interpretable Foundation Models for Scientific Discovery  

**Motivation:** Scaling AI models in science often sacrifices interpretability, which is critical for trust, hypothesis generation, and actionable insights. Current approaches prioritize performance over transparency, limiting adoption in domains like drug discovery or climate science. This research bridges the gap by developing scalable models that retain interpretability, ensuring scientific utility.  

**Main Idea:** Propose foundation models with *built-in interpretability* via domain-informed architectural constraints. For example, integrate sparse, physics-aligned attention mechanisms to trace predictions to input features or known principles (e.g., conservation laws). Combine this with modular components, where submodels activate based on input complexity, enabling dynamic scaling while preserving clarity. Train on large-scale simulated datasets (e.g., molecular dynamics) while enforcing symmetry invariances and causal relationships. Evaluate using metrics for both accuracy (e.g., prediction error) and explanation fidelity (e.g., alignment with domain knowledge). Expected outcomes include a framework that shifts the Pareto frontier, achieving state-of-the-art performance *without* compromising transparency. Impact: Accelerate adoption of scalable AI in science by providing tools that balance discovery power with interpretability.
