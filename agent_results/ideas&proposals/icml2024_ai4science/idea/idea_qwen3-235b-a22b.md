**1. Title:** *Scalable Symmetry-Aware Neural Architectures via Automated Symmetry Discovery*  

**2. Motivation:**  
Scientific systems often exhibit inherent symmetries (e.g., translational in physics, rotational in molecular structures), which are critical for physical plausibility and generalization. However, modern AI models struggle to enforce these symmetries at scale due to computational bottlenecks and manual encoding requirements. Existing methods either sacrifice symmetry preservation for scalability or fail to scale to high-dimensional scientific datasets. This gap limits the ability of AI to discover robust, interpretable models in fields like materials science, climate modeling, and quantum chemistry.  

**3. Main Idea:**  
Propose an automated framework that combines self-supervised symmetry discovery with hierarchical, scalable neural architectures. The system first uses contrastive learning to identify latent symmetries in unlabeled scientific data (e.g., molecular dynamics or particle physics simulations). These symmetries are then encoded into a modular neural architecture via *equivariant subnetworks*, which are trained in a distributed, parameter-efficient manner using tensorized operations and knowledge distillation. Key innovations include (1) a symmetry-aware scaling law that reduces computation by factorizing equivariant layers, and (2) a meta-learning phase to adaptively prune redundant symmetry constraints during training. The approach will be validated on regression and generative tasks requiring extrapolation (e.g., predicting protein folding paths or fluid dynamics). Outcome: a 2-5x speedup in symmetry-preserving training without accuracy loss, and the discovery of novel symmetries in complex systems (e.g., phase transitions in materials science). This bridges the Pareto frontier between scalability, interpretability, and physical consistency in AI for science.
