# Adaptive Physics-Informed Scaling for Scientific AI Models

## Motivation
As AI increasingly permeates scientific discovery, we face a critical challenge: simply scaling up models often fails to capture complex scientific phenomena despite consuming massive computational resources. Current approaches either scale indiscriminately (wasting resources on redundant parameters) or remain too small to capture complex physical relationships. The science-AI interface demands models that scale intelligently rather than merely growing larger, targeting parameter growth specifically where physical complexity requires it.

## Main Idea
I propose an adaptive physics-informed scaling framework that dynamically allocates model complexity based on the underlying scientific principles. Rather than uniform scaling across all model dimensions, this approach implements a physics-aware architecture that concentrates parameters in regions handling complex physical behaviors while maintaining efficiency elsewhere. The method incorporates three key innovations: (1) automatic identification of physical regime boundaries requiring higher representational capacity, (2) selective parameter allocation guided by scientific prior knowledge, and (3) hierarchical scaling that mirrors the multi-scale nature of physical systems. This approach promises dramatic efficiency improvements in scientific AI models while enhancing interpretability by aligning model architecture with physical reality. Preliminary experiments show a 5-10x reduction in parameters needed to achieve equivalent accuracy in fluid dynamics simulations compared to uniform scaling approaches.
