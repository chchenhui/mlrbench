Okay, here is a detailed research proposal based on the provided task description, research idea, and literature review.

## **1. Title: Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Self-Improvement via Dynamic Calibration of Synthetic Data (AUSI-DC)**

## **2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and embodied intelligence agents, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, largely fueled by pre-training on vast amounts of internet-scale data (Brown et al., 2020; Kaplan et al., 2020). However, the finite nature and plateauing growth rate of high-quality data pose a significant bottleneck for continued scaling (Villalobos et al., 2022). Even current scaling efforts show diminishing returns compared to test-time inference techniques, suggesting we are approaching the limits of passively consuming existing data. Similarly, domains like robotics face inherent limitations in acquiring large-scale, diverse real-world interaction data. This impending "data wall" necessitates a paradigm shift towards methods enabling models to learn and improve beyond their initial training corpora â€“ a concept often termed **self-improvement**.

Self-improvement typically involves training models on data generated by themselves or other models (synthetic data). This paradigm presents unique challenges distinct from standard supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike SL, which relies on high-quality, often human-annotated data curated independently of the learning algorithm, self-improvement algorithms must intrinsically manage data generation and curation. While RL also involves learning from generated experiences, it usually assumes access to a well-defined reward function or an environment providing ground-truth feedback. In contrast, self-improvement often relies on imperfect, learned **verifiers** or reward models to assess the quality of synthetic data. Naively training on self-generated data filtered by such verifiers can lead to catastrophic **model collapse**, where the model reinforces its own biases and errors, leading to performance degradation (Alemohammad et al., 2024). This occurs because the model might learn to exploit flaws in the verifier (the verification-generation gap) rather than genuinely improving its capabilities, or because the verifier itself drifts or fails silently. Furthermore, the controllable nature of the generation process (often primarily driven by the model's internal randomness) distinguishes it from the unpredictable external environments typical in RL, potentially allowing for more tailored algorithmic solutions.

Addressing these challenges is crucial not only for continued capability scaling but also for enhancing the **safety and alignment** of FMs. Understanding how models evolve during self-improvement, ensuring this evolution aligns with human values, and preventing the amplification of harmful biases are paramount concerns (Bai et al., 2022). Techniques like weak-to-strong generalization, where a more capable model is supervised by a weaker but trusted one, can be viewed through the lens of self-improvement with imperfect supervision and are critical for aligning superintelligent systems (Burns et al., 2023). The responsible development of self-improvement methods requires robust mechanisms to ensure stability, reliability, and value alignment throughout the learning process.

**2.2 Problem Statement**
The core problem addressed by this proposal is the instability and unreliability inherent in current self-improvement frameworks operating on synthetic data. This arises primarily from:
1.  **Overconfidence in Imperfect Verification:** Models may assign high confidence to synthetically generated samples that are incorrect or undesirable, leading to the propagation and amplification of errors when these samples are used for training. Standard filtering based on single verifier scores is often insufficient.
2.  **Lack of Uncertainty Quantification:** Existing methods typically lack principled mechanisms to quantify the uncertainty associated with the correctness or utility of a generated sample, making it difficult to distinguish genuinely useful data from potentially harmful artifacts of the generation or verification process.
3.  **Verifier Drift:** Learned verifiers, like any machine learning model, can suffer from distribution shift or drift over time as the generator model evolves, leading to progressively less reliable quality assessment and potentially triggering model collapse.

These issues hinder the development of robust, continuously learning systems that can safely scale their capabilities without constant human oversight or reliance on ever-larger static datasets.

**2.3 Proposed Solution: Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Self-Improvement (AUSI-DC)**
We propose an **Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Self-Improvement framework with Dynamic Calibration (AUSI-DC)**. The central idea is to leverage the disagreement within an *ensemble* of verifier models as a proxy for uncertainty regarding the quality of self-generated data. This uncertainty signal is then used to *adaptively* weight or select synthetic data samples for training the foundation model, prioritizing high-confidence, low-uncertainty examples. Crucially, the framework incorporates a **dynamic calibration** mechanism for the verifier ensemble, using a small buffer of trusted data to periodically correct potential drift and maintain the reliability of the uncertainty estimates.

This approach aims to directly mitigate the identified problems by:
1.  Providing a robust mechanism for identifying potentially unreliable synthetic data points (high uncertainty).
2.  Guiding the self-improvement process towards more reliable data, reducing the risk of error amplification and model collapse.
3.  Maintaining the long-term effectiveness of the verification system through periodic grounding in trusted data.

**2.4 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:
1.  **Develop the AUSI-DC Algorithm:** Formulate and implement the complete algorithmic framework, including ensemble verification, uncertainty quantification, adaptive sample weighting/selection, and dynamic verifier calibration.
2.  **Evaluate Stability and Performance:** Quantitatively assess the ability of AUSI-DC to prevent model collapse and achieve stable, long-term performance improvements compared to baseline self-improvement methods across various tasks (e.g., language modeling, code generation, mathematical reasoning).
3.  **Investigate the Role of Uncertainty:** Analyze the effectiveness of ensemble disagreement as an uncertainty signal and study the impact of different uncertainty-based weighting/selection strategies on learning dynamics.
4.  **Assess Dynamic Calibration:** Evaluate the necessity and effectiveness of the dynamic calibration mechanism in preventing verifier drift and maintaining performance over extended self-improvement cycles. Analyze sensitivity to the size, composition, and refresh rate of the trusted data buffer.
5.  **Explore Safety and Alignment Implications:** Investigate whether AUSI-DC leads to models that are more robustly aligned or safer, potentially by framing experiments within a weak-to-strong generalization context or evaluating on safety benchmarks.

**2.5 Significance**
This research addresses a critical bottleneck in scaling foundation models and developing continuously learning AI systems. By introducing a principled approach to handle uncertainty in synthetic data evaluation, AUSI-DC offers a potential solution to the pervasive problem of model collapse in self-improvement loops. Its novelty lies in the combination of ensemble-based uncertainty quantification, adaptive data utilization based on this uncertainty, and dynamic calibration to ensure long-term stability. This contrasts with methods relying on single verifiers (prone to overconfidence), static uncertainty measures, or ad-hoc filtering heuristics.

Success in this research would provide:
*   A more robust and reliable methodology for self-improving FMs, reducing the dependence on ever-expanding human-curated datasets.
*   Insights into the dynamics of learning from synthetic data and the role of uncertainty estimation.
*   A potential pathway towards safer AI by enabling more controlled and stable self-improvement, potentially aligning with principles like weak-to-strong generalization (Burns et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024) and improving calibration (Chattopadhyay et al., 2023).
*   Contributions to the broader goals outlined in the "Scaling Self-Improving Foundation Models" workshop, particularly regarding algorithms for training on machine-generated data without collapse, weak supervision, and safety/alignment.

## **3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework**
The AUSI-DC framework operates iteratively. In each iteration $t$:
1.  **Generation:** The foundation model $M^{(t)}$ generates a batch of synthetic data samples $\mathcal{D}_{synth}^{(t)} = \{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$.
2.  **Verification & Uncertainty Estimation:** An ensemble of $K$ verifier models $\{V_k^{(t)}\}_{k=1}^K$ assesses each sample $x_i$, producing scores $\{s_{ik}\}_{k=1}^K$. An aggregate quality score $\bar{s}_i$ and an uncertainty score $U_i$ are computed for each $x_i$.
3.  **Dynamic Calibration (Periodic):** If a calibration trigger condition is met, the verifier ensemble $\{V_k^{(t)}\}$ is updated to $\{V_k^{(t+1)}\}$ using a trusted data buffer $\mathcal{B}_{trust}$. Otherwise, $V_k^{(t+1)} = V_k^{(t)}$.
4.  **Adaptive Selection/Weighting:** Based on $\bar{s}_i$ and $U_i$, a subset $\mathcal{D}_{select}^{(t)} \subseteq \mathcal{D}_{synth}^{(t)}$ is selected, or weights $w_i$ are assigned to each sample $x_i$.
5.  **Training:** The foundation model $M^{(t)}$ is updated to $M^{(t+1)}$ by training on $\mathcal{D}_{select}^{(t)}$ or using the weighted samples.

**3.2 Data Generation**
Let $M^{(t)}$ be the foundation model at iteration $t$. We assume $M^{(t)}$ can generate synthetic data relevant to its task. For example:
*   **LLMs:** Generate text continuations, answers to questions, code snippets, mathematical reasoning steps. $x_i \sim M^{(t)}(prompt)$.
*   **Diffusion Models:** Generate images or other structured data. $x_i \sim M^{(t)}(condition)$.
*   **Robotics:** Generate simulated trajectories or action sequences.

**3.3 Uncertainty-Aware Verification**
*   **Verifier Ensemble:** We maintain an ensemble of $K$ verifier models $\{V_k^{(t)}\}_{k=1}^K$. These models are trained to predict the quality (e.g., correctness, relevance, safety) of a generated sample $x_i$. They could be initialized identically but trained on different data subsets or with different hyperparameters, or initialized with different random seeds. Architectural diversity could also be employed. Each $V_k^{(t)}$ outputs a score $s_{ik} = V_k^{(t)}(x_i)$. This score could be a probability (e.g., $P(\text{correct}|x_i)$), a regression value (e.g., estimated reward), or a classification label.
*   **Quality and Uncertainty Metrics:** For each sample $x_i$, we compute:
    *   **Aggregated Quality Score:** The mean score across the ensemble:
        $$ \bar{s}_i = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K s_{ik} $$
    *   **Uncertainty Score:** The disagreement among verifiers, measured for instance by the standard deviation or variance of the scores:
        $$ U_i = \sqrt{\frac{1}{K-1} \sum_{k=1}^K (s_{ik} - \bar{s}_i)^2} \quad \text{(Standard Deviation)} $$
        Alternatively, if verifiers output probability distributions $p_{ik}$, uncertainty could be based on the variance of parameters of the aggregated distribution or measures like Jensen-Shannon divergence between ensemble members' predictions.

**3.4 Dynamic Verifier Calibration**
*   **Trusted Data Buffer ($\mathcal{B}_{trust}$):** This buffer stores a relatively small set of high-quality data samples with reliable quality labels (or proxies). Sources can include:
    *   A subset of the original human-annotated pre-training data.
    *   Samples verified by humans during initial phases.
    *   Synthetic samples consistently rated as high-quality and low-uncertainty over multiple past iterations.
    *   Data from a known stronger model (in weak-to-strong settings).
*   **Calibration Trigger:** Calibration can be triggered periodically (e.g., every $C$ iterations), or adaptively based on monitoring metrics like:
    *   A significant drop in the average quality score $\bar{s}$ of selected data.
    *   A sudden shift in the distribution of uncertainty scores $U$.
    *   A decline in the main task performance of $M^{(t)}$.
*   **Calibration Mechanism:** When triggered, the verifier ensemble $\{V_k^{(t)}\}$ is updated using $\mathcal{B}_{trust}$. Possible mechanisms:
    1.  **Fine-tuning:** Fine-tune each $V_k$ (or the entire ensemble jointly) on $\mathcal{B}_{trust}$ using a standard supervised loss if labels are available.
    2.  **Calibration Loss:** Fine-tune using a specific calibration objective, such as minimizing the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) or Brier score on $\mathcal{B}_{trust}$.
        $$ \text{ECE} = \sum_{m=1}^M \frac{|B_m|}{N} |\text{acc}(B_m) - \text{conf}(B_m)| $$
        where $B_m$ are bins of samples based on predicted confidence $\text{conf}(B_m)$, and $\text{acc}(B_m)$ is the accuracy within bin $B_m$. (Guo et al., 2017).
    3.  **Parameter Adjustment:** Adjust output scaling (e.g., temperature scaling) or bias terms of the verifiers based on their performance on $\mathcal{B}_{trust}$.
    The goal is to ensure the verifier outputs $\bar{s}_i$ and $U_i$ remain reliable indicators of actual data quality and confidence. The updated ensemble is denoted $\{V_k^{(t+1)}\}$.

**3.5 Adaptive Sample Selection / Weighting**
The core adaptive mechanism uses the estimated quality $\bar{s}_i$ and uncertainty $U_i$:
*   **Weighting Scheme:** Assign a weight $w_i$ to each synthetic sample $x_i$ for use in the training loss. The weight should ideally increase with quality $\bar{s}_i$ and decrease with uncertainty $U_i$. A possible formulation:
    $$ w_i = f(\bar{s}_i) \cdot g(U_i) $$
    where $f$ is monotonically increasing (e.g., $f(s)=s$ or $f(s) = \max(0, s - \theta_s)$) and $g$ is monotonically decreasing (e.g., $g(U) = \frac{1}{1 + \lambda U_i}$ or $g(U) = \exp(-\lambda U_i)$), with $\lambda > 0$ being a hyperparameter controlling sensitivity to uncertainty. Weights can be normalized across the batch.
*   **Selection Scheme:** Alternatively, define acceptance criteria based on thresholds: Select $x_i$ if $\bar{s}_i > \theta_s$ AND $U_i < \theta_U$. The thresholds $\theta_s, \theta_U$ could be adapted over time based on overall system performance or desired data throughput.

**3.6 Foundation Model Training**
Update the foundation model $M^{(t)}$ to $M^{(t+1)}$ using the selected or weighted synthetic data. Assuming a supervised loss function $\mathcal{L}$ (e.g., cross-entropy for language modeling) and potentially needing pseudo-labels $y_i$ (which could be generated by $M^{(t)}$ itself or inferred from verifier scores), the objective is:
*   **Weighted Loss:**
    $$ M^{(t+1)} = \arg \min_{M} \sum_{x_i \in \mathcal{D}_{synth}^{(t)}} w_i \cdot \mathcal{L}(M(x_i), y_i) $$
*   **Loss on Selected Subset:**
    $$ M^{(t+1)} = \arg \min_{M} \sum_{x_i \in \mathcal{D}_{select}^{(t)}} \mathcal{L}(M(x_i), y_i) $$
This step effectively trains the model more intensely on data deemed reliable by the calibrated, uncertainty-aware verification process.

**3.7 Experimental Design**
*   **Tasks and Datasets:**
    *   **Language Modeling:** Use a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-2, Llama-2 7B). Evaluate on standard perplexity benchmarks (e.g., WikiText-103) and potentially downstream tasks (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE). Generate synthetic text by sampling from the model.
    *   **Code Generation:** Use a model like CodeGen or StarCoder. Evaluate on HumanEval or MBPP benchmarks. Generate synthetic code problems and solutions.
    *   **Mathematical Reasoning:** Use a model trained for math (e.g., Minerva, WizardMath). Evaluate on GSM8K or MATH datasets. Generate synthetic math problems or reasoning steps.
    *   **(Optional) Simulated Robotics:** Use a policy model in a simulated environment (e.g., MuJoCo, Isaac Gym). Evaluate based on task success rate. Generate synthetic trajectories or successful interaction snippets.
*   **Models:**
    *   **Foundation Model (M):** Choose architecture based on the task (e.g., Transformer).
    *   **Verifier Models (V_k):** Could be smaller versions of M, or specialized classifiers/regressors (e.g., fine-tuned BERT for text quality, ResNet for image quality if applicable). Ensemble size $K$ (e.g., $K=5$).
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **Static Model:** The initial model $M^{(0)}$ without any self-improvement.
    2.  **Naive Self-Improvement:** Train $M$ on all generated data $\mathcal{D}_{synth}^{(t)}$ without verification.
    3.  **Single Verifier SI:** Use a single verifier $V$ to filter data (e.g., train on $x_i$ if $V(x_i) > \theta$).
    4.  **Ensemble SI (No Uncertainty Weighting):** Use the mean score $\bar{s}_i$ from the ensemble to filter/weight, but ignore uncertainty $U_i$.
    5.  **AUSI (No Calibration):** Use the proposed AUSI framework but disable the dynamic calibration step (verifiers are trained once initially or not at all).
    6.  **RL Baselines (if applicable):** e.g., PPO using the mean ensemble score $\bar{s}_i$ as the reward signal.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Task Performance:** Track primary task metrics (perplexity, accuracy, BLEU, success rate, etc.) over self-improvement iterations $t$.
    *   **Stability:** Measure oscillations or drops in performance. Calculate the variance of performance over a window of iterations. Record frequency and magnitude of collapses (e.g., >10% drop in performance).
    *   **Verifier Calibration:** Periodically measure ECE or plot reliability diagrams for the verifier ensemble on held-out validation data or $\mathcal{B}_{trust}$. Compare calibration before and after dynamic calibration steps.
    *   **Uncertainty Correlation:** Analyze the correlation between the uncertainty measure $U_i$ and the actual error rate or quality of samples (requires some ground truth, possibly from humans or a stronger oracle on a subset).
    *   **Data Quality:** Analyze the quality distribution (using $\bar{s}_i$ and $U_i$) of generated and selected data over time.
    *   **Safety/Alignment:** Evaluate model outputs using safety classifiers (e.g., toxicity, bias) or specific alignment benchmarks (e.g., TruthfulQA, HHH evaluation). In weak-to-strong contexts, measure alignment with the intended "stronger" behavior.
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    *   Vary ensemble size $K$.
    *   Compare different uncertainty metrics (StdDev, Variance, etc.).
    *   Compare different weighting/selection functions ($g(U)$, thresholds).
    *   Vary calibration frequency and the size/composition of $\mathcal{B}_{trust}$.
    *   Evaluate the impact of different verifier architectures.

## **4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**
1.  **Demonstrated Stability:** We expect AUSI-DC to significantly reduce the incidence and severity of model collapse compared to baseline self-improvement methods (Naive SI, Single Verifier SI, Ensemble SI without uncertainty/calibration). Performance curves over time should be more stable and monotonically improving for longer periods.
2.  **Improved Performance:** By focusing training on high-quality, low-uncertainty synthetic data, AUSI-DC is expected to achieve better final task performance or reach target performance levels more efficiently (fewer iterations or less generated data) compared to baselines that waste computation on unreliable data or suffer collapse.
3.  **Effective Uncertainty Estimation:** The experimental results should validate that ensemble disagreement serves as a useful proxy for uncertainty in synthetic data quality. We expect to observe a correlation between high uncertainty $U_i$ and lower actual quality or higher error rates.
4.  **Validation of Dynamic Calibration:** We anticipate showing that dynamic calibration is crucial for long-term stability, preventing gradual degradation of the verification process due to drift. The comparison against AUSI (No Calibration) should highlight this benefit. Analysis will provide insights into optimal calibration strategies (frequency, buffer size).
5.  **Enhanced Safety/Alignment:** By filtering out uncertain (potentially anomalous or unsafe) generations and maintaining verifier reliability, AUSI-DC might implicitly improve model safety and alignment metrics compared to less controlled self-improvement methods. Experiments in weak-to-strong settings could explicitly demonstrate improved alignment capabilities.
6.  **Algorithmic Contributions:** The research will yield a novel, fully specified algorithm (AUSI-DC) for robust self-improvement, along with practical guidelines for its implementation and parameter tuning.

**4.2 Potential Impact**
*   **Scientific Impact:** This work will contribute to a deeper understanding of self-improvement dynamics in FMs, particularly the interplay between generation, verification, uncertainty, and stability. It will provide a principled framework for managing uncertainty in machine-generated data, advancing research in areas like reliable AI, calibration under distribution shift (Chattopadhyay et al., 2023), and learning from imperfect feedback. It directly addresses key questions posed by the workshop on avoiding collapse and enabling weak-to-strong generalization.
*   **Technological Impact:** AUSI-DC offers a practical pathway to overcome the data bottleneck for scaling FMs. If successful, it could enable the development of more capable AI systems that can continuously learn and adapt in their domains with reduced reliance on human supervision and static datasets. This has implications for various applications, including autonomous agents, advanced scientific discovery tools, and perpetually improving software systems (Williams et al., 2024).
*   **Safety and Societal Impact:** By promoting more stable and controlled self-improvement, AUSI-DC can contribute to the development of safer and more reliable AI systems. The emphasis on uncertainty awareness and calibration aligns with principles of responsible AI development, potentially mitigating risks associated with unpredictable emergent behaviors during open-ended learning (Alemohammad et al., 2024). Providing mechanisms for robust self-improvement under weak supervision is also a step towards addressing long-term alignment challenges. This directly engages with the workshop's goal of integrating safety and alignment as primary objectives.

In summary, this research proposes a novel and principled approach to address critical stability and reliability challenges in self-improving foundation models. By adaptively leveraging uncertainty information and dynamically calibrating the verification process, AUSI-DC aims to unlock safer and more effective continuous learning, paving the way for the next generation of scalable and robust AI systems.
