# Title: SafeTrack: A Verification Framework for Preventing Collapse in Self-Improving Models

## Motivation
Self-improving foundation models (SIFMs) that train on their own generated data risk catastrophic collapse when verification mechanisms fail. Unlike reinforcement learning with reliable reward signals, SIFMs must contend with potentially unreliable verification systems. As we approach data constraints for pre-training large models, developing robust self-improvement methods becomes critical to continued AI advancement. Current approaches lack safeguards against the verification-generation gap, where the model exploits weaknesses in verification systems, leading to aligned but incorrect behaviors.

## Main Idea
SafeTrack implements a multi-layered verification framework that monitors for early signs of collapse during self-improvement. The system maintains a diverse ensemble of verification models with complementary strengths, rotating their influence based on disagreement patterns. It incorporates a small, high-quality reference dataset as an anchor to detect drift from desired capabilities. Crucially, SafeTrack employs statistical anomaly detection to identify when the model begins exploiting verification weaknesses, automatically triggering model checkpointing and verification recalibration. The framework can dynamically adjust the learning rate or even halt training on particular task dimensions where verification reliability drops below confidence thresholds. This approach allows models to safely improve on generations without human supervision while maintaining guardrails against collapse, creating more reliable pathways for autonomous AI enhancement.
