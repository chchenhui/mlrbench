### Title: Adaptive Self-Improvement with Error-Correcting Reinforcement Learning

### Motivation:
As foundation models (FMs) scale, the finite and growing scarcity of high-quality training data becomes a significant bottleneck. Self-improving models, which generate their own training data, offer a promising solution. However, existing methods often struggle with errors in the evaluation models and the lack of a meaningful reward signal. This research aims to address these challenges by developing an adaptive self-improvement framework that incorporates error-correcting reinforcement learning (RL).

### Main Idea:
The proposed research focuses on developing an adaptive self-improvement framework that leverages error-correcting RL to enhance the reliability and effectiveness of self-improving models. The main idea involves the following steps:

1. **Error-Correcting RL Algorithm**: Design an RL algorithm that can adapt to errors made by the evaluation model. This algorithm will use a combination of model-generated data and human-annotated data to train the model. The algorithm will also incorporate a reward model that can learn to correct errors made by the evaluation model.

2. **Adaptive Training**: Implement an adaptive training process that adjusts the learning rate and other hyperparameters based on the performance of the model. This process will help the model to converge more quickly and prevent model collapse.

3. **Verification-Generation Gap**: Investigate the conditions under which the verification-generation gap is feasible and how it can be exploited to improve the performance of the model. This research will also explore the theoretical limits of self-improvement training.

4. **Application to Downstream Domains**: Study the application of the adaptive self-improvement framework in various downstream domains, such as software agents, robotic self-improvement, and multi-modal systems.

The expected outcomes of this research include a more reliable and effective self-improving model, a better understanding of the conditions under which self-improvement is feasible, and the development of theoretical guarantees on the reliability of self-improvement training. The potential impact of this research is significant, as it can help to overcome the data bottleneck and enable the development of more capable and adaptable foundation models.
