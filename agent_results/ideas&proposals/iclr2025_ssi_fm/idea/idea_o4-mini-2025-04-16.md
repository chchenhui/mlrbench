Title: Trust-Region Divergence-Constrained Self-Improvement

Motivation:
Foundation models soon exhaust high-quality human-curated data and risk performance collapse when trained on unchecked self-generated samples. We need self-improvement algorithms that guard against verifier errors and distribution drift, ensuring stable iterative gains without human supervision.

Main Idea:
Introduce a two-stage pipeline combining divergence constraints and uncertainty-aware verification.  
1. Synthetic Generation: A base FM (or mixture-of-experts) proposes candidate examples.  
2. Ensemble Verification with Uncertainty: An ensemble of lightweight verifiers (via dropout or deep ensembles) scores each sampleâ€™s task fidelity and estimates epistemic uncertainty.  
3. Trust-Region Filtering: Retain only examples whose KL divergence from a reference real-data distribution lies below a dynamic threshold and whose verifier uncertainty is low.  
4. Curriculum-Driven Fine-Tuning: Iteratively fine-tune the FM, gradually relaxing trust-region bounds to expand its competence without collapse.  

Expected outcomes include stable performance gains on language and robotic tasks, a controlled verification-generation feedback loop, and a practical framework for scalable, safe self-improvement without human labels.
