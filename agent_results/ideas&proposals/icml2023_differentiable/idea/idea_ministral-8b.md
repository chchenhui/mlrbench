### Title: Differentiable Graph Algorithms for Improved Machine Learning Performance

### Motivation:
Graph algorithms are ubiquitous in machine learning, especially in tasks involving networks, graphs, and relational data. However, traditional graph algorithms are non-differentiable, making it challenging to optimize models that rely on them using gradient-based methods. This research aims to develop differentiable relaxations for common graph algorithms to enable more efficient and effective gradient-based optimization.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research focuses on creating differentiable versions of popular graph algorithms, such as shortest-path, minimum spanning tree, and clustering algorithms. By relaxing these discrete algorithms into continuous functions, we can compute gradients and enable gradient-based optimization. The methodology involves:

1. **Relaxation Techniques**: Applying smoothing and other continuous relaxation techniques to replace discrete operations with differentiable proxies.
2. **Gradient Estimation**: Utilizing stochastic smoothing and other gradient estimation methods to handle the non-differentiability of discrete steps.
3. **Implementation**: Developing differentiable versions of these algorithms within a modular deep learning framework.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of these differentiable graph algorithms on various machine learning tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph generation.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved training efficiency for models that rely on graph algorithms.
- Enhanced learning capabilities for tasks involving graph-structured data.
- A set of differentiable graph algorithms that can be easily integrated into existing machine learning pipelines.

Potential impact:
- Enabling more sophisticated and efficient graph-based machine learning models.
- Facilitating the development of new applications in domains like social networks, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics.
- Advancing the field of differentiable programming by demonstrating practical applications of differentiable relaxations.
