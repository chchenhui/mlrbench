1. **Title**: Causal Mechanism Identification for Targeted Foundation Model Interventions  
2. **Motivation**: Foundation models often generate harmful content due to poorly understood causal mechanisms within their architectures. Current interventions lack precision, leading to unintended side effects or reduced model utility. Identifying the exact components (e.g., neurons, attention heads) responsible for specific undesirable behaviors is critical for developing targeted, effective fixes without compromising performance.  
3. **Main Idea**: This research proposes a causal discovery framework to map internal model components to harmful generation behaviors. Using counterfactual analysis and activation patching, we will trace causal pathways by systematically perturbing activations and measuring their impact on output toxicity, bias, or misinformation. A causal graph will be constructed to quantify the influence of each component, enabling targeted interventions. For example, if a specific attention head is identified as causally linked to hate speech, its parameters or activations can be edited or masked. The methodology will integrate causal mediation analysis with scalable probing tools, validated through ablation studies and human evaluation. Expected outcomes include a toolkit for diagnosing and addressing harmful behaviors with minimal disruption to model capabilities, advancing safe and controllable deployment. This work bridges interpretability and intervention, offering a systematic approach to align model behavior with ethical standards.
