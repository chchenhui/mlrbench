**Research Proposal: Surgical Circuit Interventions for Targeted Harm Reduction in Foundation Models**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Foundation models (FMs) like large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications but face critical challenges in safety and reliability. Their propensity to generate harmful, biased, or toxic content stems from biases in training data and opaque internal mechanisms. Traditional mitigation strategies, such as full fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), are computationally expensive and risk degrading general capabilities. Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offer promising pathways for targeted interventions. However, key challenges remain: (1) identifying *causal* neural circuits responsible for harmful behaviors, and (2) designing precise, efficient interventions that neutralize these pathways without collateral damage to model performance.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research aims to:  
1. Develop a framework for identifying minimal neural circuits causally linked to specific harmful behaviors (e.g., toxicity, bias) in FMs.  
2. Design computationally efficient intervention methods (e.g., low-rank "circuit breakers" or activation offsets) to surgically disable harmful pathways.  
3. Validate the interventions’ effectiveness in reducing harm while preserving model fluency and task performance.  

**Significance**  
By enabling precise control over FM behavior, this work will advance the safety and reliability of AI systems. It bridges mechanistic interpretability with practical intervention strategies, offering a scalable solution to mitigate harms without costly retraining. The outcomes will directly contribute to the MINT workshop’s goals of improving FM controllability and understanding.

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### **2.1 Research Design**  
The research comprises three phases:  
1. **Causal Circuit Identification**: Use causal tracing to locate neural circuits responsible for harmful behaviors.  
2. **Intervention Design**: Develop low-rank or activation-based methods to disrupt identified circuits.  
3. **Validation**: Evaluate intervention efficacy on safety and general performance benchmarks.  

#### **2.2 Data Collection**  
- **Harmful Behavior Datasets**:  
  - Toxicity: RealToxicityPrompts (Gehman et al., 2020), ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022).  
  - Bias: StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021), BiasBench (Smith et al., 2022).  
- **General Capability Benchmarks**:  
  - GLUE (Wang et al., 2018), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022).  

#### **2.3 Causal Circuit Identification**  
Building on causal tracing (Doe & Smith, 2023), we will:  
1. **Inject Noise**: Corrupt intermediate activations during inference for a harmful input.  
2. **Measure Recovery**: Track how restoring specific activations (e.g., attention heads, MLP neurons) recovers harmful outputs.  
3. **Identify Critical Components**: Use gradient-based saliency maps to isolate minimal circuits.  

Mathematically, for a harmful output $y_h$ given input $x$, we compute the causal effect $\Delta_{i,j}$ of perturbing activation $a_{i,j}$ (layer $i$, neuron $j$):  
$$
\Delta_{i,j} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \log P(y_h | \text{do}(a_{i,j} = \tilde{a}_{i,j})) - \log P(y_h | x) \right],
$$  
where $\text{do}(\cdot)$ denotes an intervention. Circuits with $\Delta_{i,j} > \tau$ (a significance threshold) are flagged as causal.  

#### **2.4 Intervention Design**  
Two intervention strategies will be explored:  

**A. Low-Rank Circuit Breakers**  
Inspired by FLORAIN (Jiang et al., 2025) and LoRA (Hu et al., 2021), we inject trainable low-rank matrices into the identified circuits. For a weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ in a causal attention head, we compute:  
$$
W' = W + \alpha \cdot B \cdot A,
$$  
where $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d}$ are low-rank ($r \ll d$) adapters, and $\alpha$ is a scaling factor. The adapters are trained to minimize harmful outputs while preserving original activations:  
$$
\mathcal{L} = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{harm}}} \left[ \log P(y_h | x) \right]}_{\text{Harm Reduction}} + \lambda \cdot \underbrace{\|W' \cdot x - W \cdot x\|_2}_{\text{Preservation Regularizer}}.
$$  

**B. Activation Offsets**  
Following Johnson & Lee (2023), we apply learned offsets $\delta$ to activations in causal circuits during inference:  
$$
a_{i,j}' = a_{i,j} + \delta_{i,j} \cdot \mathbb{I}_{\text{causal}}(i,j),
$$  
where $\mathbb{I}_{\text{causal}}(i,j)$ is an indicator for causal components. The offsets are optimized via gradient descent on a harm reduction loss.  

#### **2.5 Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against full fine-tuning, BA-LoRA (Chang et al., 2024), and PEFTDebias (Agarwal et al., 2023).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Safety**: Toxicity score (e.g., Perspective API), bias score (e.g., StereoSet).  
  - **General Performance**: Perplexity, accuracy on GLUE/MMLU.  
  - **Efficiency**: Training time, memory footprint.  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Use paired t-tests to confirm significance (p < 0.05).

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Causal Circuit Atlas**: A catalog of neural circuits linked to specific harms (e.g., gender bias circuits in Layer 12, Heads 3–5).  
2. **Intervention Framework**: Open-source tools for applying low-rank or activation-based interventions.  
3. **Empirical Results**: Demonstrating ≥50% reduction in toxicity/bias with <5% degradation in general capabilities.  

**Impact**  
- **Technical**: A paradigm shift from brute-force fine-tuning to precise, interpretable interventions.  
- **Societal**: Safer FMs for high-stakes applications (e.g., healthcare, education).  
- **Community**: Alignment with MINT’s mission to foster controllable and transparent AI.

### 4. **Conclusion**  
This proposal addresses the urgent need for surgical interventions in FMs by combining causal interpretability with parameter-efficient adaptation. By focusing on minimal neural circuits, the project aims to deliver a scalable, practical solution for harm reduction—ensuring FMs remain both powerful and safe. The outcomes will advance the field of AI safety and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners.
