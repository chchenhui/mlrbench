# **Surgical Circuit Interventions for Targeted Harm Reduction in Foundation Models**

## **1. Introduction**

### **Background**
Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities in text generation, reasoning, and code synthesis. However, their tendency to perpetuate *biases*, generate *toxic content*, and reinforce harmful *stereotypes* remains a critical challenge. Traditional mitigation strategies—such as full fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or blanket filtering—often incur substantial computational costs or degrade the model’s general capabilities (e.g., fluency, factual accuracy). For instance, full fine-tuning requires retraining all model parameters, which is resource-intensive and risks overfitting to narrow safety datasets. Meanwhile, heuristic-based filters may suppress valid outputs, compromising utility.

Recent advances in *activation engineering* and *low-rank adaptations* (e.g., LoRA) offer promising but insufficiently targeted interventions. FLORAIN (Jiang et al., 2025) applies nonlinear low-rank mappings to suppress harmful outputs but does so indiscriminately across all attention heads, potentially affecting unrelated capabilities. Similarly, BA-LoRA (Chang et al., 2024) introduces regularization to mitigate bias but lacks spatial precision. These approaches highlight the need for *causally specific* interventions that neutralize harmful behaviors without collateral damage.

### **Research Objectives**
This proposal aims to:
1. **Identify Minimal Neural Circuits**: Locate precise subnetworks (e.g., specific attention heads, MLPs) causally responsible for undesirable behaviors like toxicity or gender bias using causal tracing (Doe & Smith, 2023).
2. **Develop Surgical Interventions**: Design low-rank modifications (e.g., activation offsets, weight edits) tailored to disable harmful pathways while preserving model integrity.
3. **Evaluate Trade-offs**: Quantify the impact of interventions on harm reduction versus utility retention across diverse benchmarks.

### **Significance**
The proposed work directly addresses the MINT NeurIPS workshop’s goals by:
- **Advancing Controllability**: Enabling precise, model-agnostic interventions to mitigate risks.
- **Democratizing Safety**: Reducing computational costs via low-rank methods, making mitigations accessible for resource-limited stakeholders.
- **Improving Interpretability**: Providing insights into how harms are encoded mechanistically in FMs.

## **2. Methodology**

### **2.1 Causal Circuit Identification**
We extend causal tracing (Doe & Smith, 2023) to identify circuits responsible for harmful outputs. Let $L_{\text{base}}(\theta)$ be the cross-entropy loss of a pre-trained FM with parameters $\theta$ on a harmful dataset. A **harmful circuit** $C^*$ is defined as the minimal subnetwork whose ablation (via masking or noise injection—Mitchell et al., 2022) maximally reduces harmful tokens $T_{\text{toxic}}$ while preserving $T_{\text{benign}}$:

$$
C^* = \argmin_{C \subseteq \theta} \left[\frac{\| \nabla_{W_C} L_{\text{toxic}} \|_2}{\| \nabla_{W_{\neg C}} L_{\text{benign}} \|_2} \right],
$$

where $W_C$ are weights in circuit $C$ and $W_{\neg C}$ are those in the complement.

**Steps**:
- **Step 1**: Construct a dataset $D^{\text{causal}}$ of prompts explicitly eliciting harmful/benign responses.
- **Step 2**: Compute gradient magnitudes for all weights $W$ during harmful outputs. Rank neurons/heads by the ratio $\rho = |T_{\text{toxic}}| / |T_{\text{benign}}|$.
- **Step 3**: Prune top-$k$ high-rho units and evaluate performance on HarmBench (Liu et al., 2023) to identify the smallest $k$ achieving ≥90% toxicity reduction with ≤5% fluency drop.

### **2.2 Intervention Framework**
Once $C^*$ is identified, we design minimal interventions targeting the most influential parameters. Three approaches are explored:

#### **2.2.1 Low-Rank Activation Steering**
For attention heads or MLPs in $C^*$, we inject low-rank matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ ($r < < d$) to offset activations:

$$
h' = h + AB^T h,
$$

where $h$ is the raw activation. The intervention is optimized to minimize harmful token probabilities under a constraint:

$$
\min_{A,B} \sum_{t \in T_{\text{toxic}}} \log p_{\theta'}(y = \text{harmless}|x) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \|AB^T\|_F \leq \epsilon.
$$

This follows FLORAIN’s (Jiang et al., 2025) paradigm but restricts the intervention to $C^*$.

#### **2.2.2 Precision-Targeted Weight Edits**
For critical neurons in $C^*$, we modify weights using a sparse, low-rank update:

$$
\Delta W = UV^T, \quad \text{rank}(U) = r,
$$

and update $W \leftarrow W + \alpha \Delta W$, where $\alpha$ is a scaling factor. This mirrors LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) but focuses $\Delta W$ on harmful circuits.

#### **2.2.3 Hybrid Approach**
Combine activation steering and weight edits for robustness, balancing immediate inference-time adjustments with persistent weight modifications.

### **2.3 Experimental Design**

#### **2.3.2 Baseline Models**
- LLaMa-2-7B, Falcon-7B, and Mistral-7B, due to their open-access and diversity in training data.
- **Competing Methods**: FLORAIN (Jiang et al., 2025), BA-LoRA (Chang et al., 2024), PEFTDebias (Agarwal et al., 2023).

#### **2.3.3 Metrics**
- **Primary Metrics**:
  - **Toxicity Reduction**: Per Perspective API (Google Jigsaw).
  - **Bias Mitigation**: WinoSter benchmarks (Nangia et al., 2020).
- **Utility Metrics**:

#### **2.3.4 Ablation Studies**
- **Circuit Scope**: Test interventions on attention vs. MLP layers.
- **Rank Sensitivity**: Vary $r \in \{1, 2, 4, 8\}$ to study trade-offs between efficacy and efficiency.
- **Layer Selection**: Compare results using circuits from lower (embodied) vs. higher (logical) layers (White et al., 2024).

#### **2.3.5 Computational Tools**

## **3. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

### **3.1 Technical Outcomes**
1. **Circuit Atlases**: Maps of harmful circuits across different FMs (e.g., attention heads 4-7 in LLaMa-2 encode gender bias).
2. **Intervention Codebook**: Open-source Python API to deploy low-rank steering/editing modules, reducing toxicity by ≥40% on HarmBench with ≤2% GLUE degradation.
3. **Optimal Rank Profiles**: Empirical evidence that $r=2$ suffices for most circuits.

### **3.2 Scientific Impact**
- **Mechanistic Insights**: Confirm hypotheses (White et al., 2024) that harmful behaviors emerge via sparse, modular circuits.
- **Paradigm Shift**: Demonstrate that harms are "patchable" without full retraining, advancing model controllability.

### **3.3 Broader Implications**
- **Policy**: Enable regulators to mandate targeted red-team audits of harmful circuits.
- **Industry**: Reduce the $ \sim \$10M $ cost of full retraining (Gordon, 2023) to <$10k/month for inference-time steering.

By integrating causal tracing and low-rank adaptations, this work pioneers "surgical" interventions to neutralize harmful FMs behaviors. Through rigorous validation and open-source release, we aim to establish a new standard in safe, efficient model adaptation, aligning with NeurIPS MINT’s mission to demystify and democratize foundation model safety.
