## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **Proactive Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models through Contrastively Calibrated Internal Confidence**

**2. Introduction**

**Background:** Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Llama, and Mistral have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide spectrum of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, fundamentally altering human-computer interaction and information access (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023). Built upon vast datasets and complex neural architectures, these models can generate fluent, coherent, and contextually relevant text. However, their prowess is often undermined by a critical flaw: the propensity to generate "hallucinations" – statements that appear plausible and confident but are factually incorrect or nonsensical (Ji et al., 2023). These hallucinations pose significant risks, eroding user trust, potentially spreading misinformation, and limiting the safe deployment of LLMs in high-stakes domains such as medicine, finance, and education.

Current approaches to mitigating hallucinations largely rely on post-hoc verification. This involves using external knowledge bases, search engines, or separate fact-checking models to validate the LLM's output after generation (Nakano et al., 2021; Menick et al., 2022). While useful, these methods suffer from several limitations: they can be computationally expensive, introduce significant latency (rendering them unsuitable for real-time applications), may struggle with rapidly evolving information or niche topics not covered by external resources, and fail to address the root cause of hallucination generation within the model itself. Furthermore, some methods focus on calibration based on consistency across multiple samples (Lyu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024), which increases computational overhead during inference.

There is a growing need for methods that enable LLMs to become inherently aware of their potential for hallucination *during* the generation process. Recent research has begun exploring the internal states of LLMs – such as token probabilities, activation patterns, and attention weights – as potential indicators of uncertainty or factual inconsistency (Beigi et al., 2024; Su et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024). These studies suggest that internal representations might hold valuable signals about the model's confidence in its own output, distinct from simple output token probabilities. Leveraging these internal signals proactively could allow an LLM to self-assess its generated content and flag potential inaccuracies in real-time, significantly enhancing its reliability and trustworthiness.

**Research Objectives:** This research aims to develop and evaluate a novel framework for proactive hallucination detection and mitigation in LLMs by calibrating their internal confidence signals against factual accuracy. The core idea is to fine-tune LLMs using a contrastive learning approach, training them to differentiate between internal states associated with factual outputs and those associated with hallucinations. Our specific objectives are:

1.  **Identify and Characterize Internal Confidence Correlates:** Investigate various internal LLM states (e.g., entropy of token prediction distributions, specific layer activations, attention patterns) to identify features that correlate strongly with the factual accuracy of generated text.
2.  **Develop a Contrastive Calibration Framework:** Design and implement a fine-tuning methodology based on contrastive learning. This framework will train the LLM to produce internal representations and associated confidence scores that are well-calibrated, meaning higher confidence scores correspond to factually correct statements and lower scores to hallucinations.
3.  **Integrate Proactive Flagging Mechanism:** Incorporate the calibrated confidence mechanism into the LLM's inference process, enabling it to dynamically assess the likelihood of hallucination for generated segments and flag potentially unreliable outputs in real-time (e.g., by appending uncertainty markers or providing a confidence score).
4.  **Evaluate Efficacy and Efficiency:** Rigorously evaluate the proposed method's performance in terms of hallucination detection accuracy, confidence calibration quality, impact on generation quality (fluency, coherence), and computational overhead compared to baseline LLMs and existing post-hoc verification techniques.

**Significance:** This research directly addresses the critical challenge of LLM trustworthiness, a central theme of the Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Large Language Models. By focusing on *proactive* internal confidence calibration, our work offers several potential advancements:

*   **Enhanced Reliability:** Enabling LLMs to self-assess and flag potential hallucinations improves their reliability for users and downstream applications.
*   **Improved Efficiency:** Proactive detection integrated into the generation process is potentially faster and more resource-efficient than many post-hoc verification methods.
*   **Increased Transparency:** Providing calibrated confidence scores offers users greater transparency regarding the potential factuality of LLM outputs.
*   **Scientific Contribution:** This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the relationship between LLM internal states and factual accuracy, advancing the fields of LLM interpretability and reliability. It explores the synergy between contrastive learning and internal state analysis for hallucination mitigation, addressing challenges identified in recent literature regarding calibration (Chhikara, 2025; Zhang et al., 2024) and generalization (Zhang et al., 2024).

**3. Methodology**

Our proposed method, "Contrastively Calibrated Internal Confidence" (CCIC), aims to fine-tune LLMs to proactively identify potential hallucinations based on their internal states.

**3.1 Data Collection and Preparation:**
To train the contrastive calibration mechanism, we require a dataset comprising pairs or triplets of (context, factual statement, hallucinated statement). We will construct this dataset using a combination of strategies:

1.  **Leveraging Existing Factuality Datasets:** Utilize established benchmarks like TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021), FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018), and potentially domain-specific Q&A datasets. Factual statements can be derived from verified answers.
2.  **Generating Hallucinations:**
    *   **Model-Generated:** Employ a capable LLM (potentially the base model before CCIC fine-tuning or a different powerful LLM) prompted to generate answers to questions from the factual datasets. We will filter these generations, selecting those identified as factually incorrect either by automated fact-checkers or potentially human annotation (if resources permit) to serve as hallucinated examples. Techniques inspired by TrueTeacher (Gekhman et al., 2023) for synthetic data generation might be adapted.
    *   **Negation/Modification:** Systematically modify factual statements from existing datasets to create plausible-sounding but incorrect counterparts (e.g., negating facts, swapping entities).
3.  **Data Structure:** The training data will consist of tuples $(q, s_f, s_h)$, where $q$ is a prompt or question, $s_f$ is a known factual continuation/answer, and $s_h$ is a known hallucinated continuation/answer related to $q$. Diversity across multiple knowledge domains (e.g., science, history, common sense) will be ensured.

**3.2 Identifying and Extracting Internal Confidence Signals:**
During the generation of both factual ($s_f$) and hallucinated ($s_h$) statements, we will extract relevant internal states from the LLM. Potential signals include:

*   **Token-level Log-probabilities/Entropy:** The negative log-probability or entropy of the predicted token distribution at each generation step $t$: $H(P(x_t | x_{<t}, q))$. High entropy might indicate uncertainty.
*   **Layer Activations:** Representations from specific intermediate layers (e.g., final few transformer blocks). Research like Beigi et al. (2024) suggests pooling activations across layers might be beneficial. We will explore average-pooled or max-pooled activations across tokens within a generated sequence or segment. Let $A_l$ be the activation matrix of layer $l$. We could extract features like $v = \text{Pool}(A_L)$ for the last layer $L$.
*   **Attention Patterns:** Aggregated attention weights, potentially focusing on attention paid to the prompt versus previously generated tokens.

These raw signals will be processed to form a feature vector $z$ representing the internal state associated with generating a particular statement (or segment). This could involve concatenation, averaging, or passing raw features through a small feed-forward network. $z = f_{\theta}(s, q)$, where $f_{\theta}$ represents the LLM processing and feature extraction process.

**3.3 Contrastive Calibration Fine-Tuning:**
We propose fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama-2, Mistral) using a contrastive loss objective. The goal is to train the model such that the internal states $z_f$ associated with generating factual statements $s_f$ are distinguishable from the states $z_h$ associated with generating hallucinations $s_h$.

1.  **Confidence Predictor:** We introduce a lightweight projection head $g_{\phi}(z)$ parameterized by $\phi$, which takes the extracted internal feature vector $z$ and outputs a scalar confidence score $c \in [0, 1]$. This could be a simple linear layer followed by a sigmoid activation: $c = \sigma(Wz + b)$.
2.  **Contrastive Loss:** For each training tuple $(q, s_f, s_h)$, we generate the respective statements and extract their internal feature vectors $z_f = f_{\theta}(s_f, q)$ and $z_h = f_{\theta}(s_h, q)$. We then compute their confidence scores $c_f = g_{\phi}(z_f)$ and $c_h = g_{\phi}(z_h)$. The contrastive loss aims to maximize $c_f$ and minimize $c_h$. A suitable loss function is the binary cross-entropy loss applied contrastively:
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{CCIC} = -\mathbb{E}_{(q, s_f, s_h) \sim D} \left[ \log(g_{\phi}(f_{\theta}(s_f, q))) + \log(1 - g_{\phi}(f_{\theta}(s_h, q))) \right] $$
    This loss encourages the model to assign high confidence scores (close to 1) to factual generations and low confidence scores (close to 0) to hallucinated ones.
3.  **Joint Optimization:** We will fine-tune both the LLM parameters $\theta$ and the confidence head parameters $\phi$ jointly using the contrastive loss $\mathcal{L}_{CCIC}$. We might also incorporate the standard language modeling loss (next-token prediction) during fine-tuning to maintain generative capabilities, leading to a combined loss:
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{LM} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{CCIC} $$
    where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter balancing the two objectives. Standard optimization techniques (e.g., AdamW optimizer with appropriate learning rate scheduling) will be used.

**3.4 Proactive Flagging during Inference:**
During text generation at inference time, for each generated segment (potentially sentence-level or a fixed window of tokens), we extract its internal feature vector $z_{gen}$ and compute its confidence score $c_{gen} = g_{\phi}(z_{gen})$. We establish a confidence threshold $\tau$ based on performance on a validation set (e.g., maximizing F1-score for hallucination detection or achieving a desired precision/recall trade-off).

If $c_{gen} < \tau$, the system flags the generated segment as potentially unreliable. Flagging mechanisms could include:
*   Appending a textual marker: e.g., "[Low Confidence]"
*   Providing the numerical confidence score: e.g., "(Confidence: 35%)"
*   In interactive scenarios, prompting the user for verification or offering to rephrase.

**3.5 Experimental Design:**

*   **Base Models:** We will use publicly available pre-trained LLMs of varying sizes (e.g., Mistral-7B, Llama-2-13B) to assess scalability and generalizability.
*   **Datasets:**
    *   **Training:** As described in Section 3.1.
    *   **Evaluation:** We will use held-out portions of the training datasets and standard hallucination/factuality benchmarks like TruthfulQA, HaluEval (Li et al., 2023), and potentially domain-specific sets (e.g., MedQA for medical domain).
*   **Baselines:** We will compare CCIC against:
    1.  **Base LLM:** The original pre-trained LLM without any modification (to establish baseline hallucination rates).
    2.  **Entropy/Probability Baseline:** Using raw token probability or sequence-level entropy as a confidence measure without contrastive training.
    3.  **Post-hoc Consistency:** Methods based on sampling multiple outputs and measuring consistency (e.g., Lyu et al., 2024).
    4.  **Post-hoc Fact-Checking:** Using an external API or model for verification (e.g., Google Search API, a separate NLI model).
    5.  **Existing Internal State Methods:** Implementations or results from related works like MIND (Su et al., 2024) or methods focusing on calibration (Zhang et al., 2024), if feasible.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Hallucination Detection Performance:** Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUROC, and AUPRC for classifying generated statements (at sentence or segment level) as factual vs. hallucinated based on the confidence score $c_{gen}$ and threshold $\tau$.
    *   **Confidence Calibration:** Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier Score, Reliability Diagrams to assess how well the predicted confidence scores reflect the true likelihood of correctness.
    *   **Generation Quality:** Standard NLG metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE on relevant tasks like summarization if applicable), Perplexity, and crucially, **Human Evaluation** assessing factual accuracy, fluency, coherence, and perceived trustworthiness of the outputs, especially comparing flagged vs. unflagged content.
    *   **Efficiency:** Measure the increase in inference latency and computational cost (e.g., FLOPs) compared to the base LLM.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**Expected Outcomes:**

1.  **A Calibrated LLM:** We expect to produce fine-tuned LLMs whose internal confidence scores, derived through the CCIC framework, are significantly better correlated with factual accuracy compared to baseline confidence measures (like raw token probability) and uncalibrated models.
2.  **Effective Proactive Detection:** The research is expected to demonstrate that the CCIC method can proactively detect and flag a significant portion of hallucinations during generation with reasonable precision and recall, outperforming simple uncertainty heuristics and potentially offering advantages over post-hoc methods in terms of speed.
3.  **Quantitative Evaluation:** We anticipate providing comprehensive benchmark results comparing CCIC against relevant baselines on standard hallucination datasets, quantifying improvements in detection accuracy (F1, AUROC), calibration (ECE), and providing insights into the impact on generation quality and efficiency.
4.  **Analysis of Internal Signals:** The study will yield insights into which internal states (activations, entropy, attention) are most indicative of factual consistency and how contrastive learning reshapes these internal representations.
5.  **Framework and Insights:** We aim to deliver a well-documented methodology (CCIC) and potentially release code and fine-tuned model weights (subject to licensing) to facilitate further research. The findings will provide practical guidance on implementing proactive hallucination detection.

**Impact:**

*   **Scientific Impact:** This research will contribute to the growing body of knowledge on LLM reliability, interpretability, and internal mechanisms. It will demonstrate the potential of contrastive learning applied to internal states for complex semantic properties like factuality, potentially inspiring similar approaches for other desired attributes (e.g., detecting toxicity, bias). It directly addresses key challenges highlighted in the literature regarding calibration and real-time detection (Su et al., 2024; Chhikara, 2025).
*   **Practical Impact:** By providing a mechanism for proactive hallucination flagging, this work can significantly enhance the trustworthiness and safety of LLMs in real-world applications. This could lead to:
    *   More reliable AI assistants, Q&A systems, and content generators.
    *   Reduced risk of misinformation propagation by LLMs.
    *   Increased user confidence in LLM outputs through transparent uncertainty signaling.
    *   Potential integration into LLM deployment pipelines to monitor and mitigate factual errors efficiently.
*   **Relevance to Workshop:** The proposed research directly aligns with the core themes of the Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Large Language Models, specifically addressing "Reliability assurance and assessment of LLMs," "Fact verification (e.g. hallucinated generation)," and contributing novel algorithmic solutions to enhance LLM trustworthiness. The findings will be highly relevant to researchers and practitioners working on making LLMs safer and more dependable.

By developing and validating the CCIC framework, this research seeks to make a tangible contribution towards building more trustworthy and reliable Large Language Models, capable of acknowledging their own potential for error.
