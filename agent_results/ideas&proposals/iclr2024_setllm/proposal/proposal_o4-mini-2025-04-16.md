Title  
Proactive Hallucination Detection via Internal Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, LLaMA and PaLM have achieved remarkable performance across a variety of natural language processing tasks. However, a critical barrier to their safe deployment in high‐stakes domains (e.g., healthcare, law, science) is their tendency to generate plausible but factually incorrect or fabricated content—so-called “hallucinations.” Traditional defenses rely on post-hoc verification or external retrieval systems, which can incur high latency and cannot prevent the user from seeing the hallucinated output.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to endow LLMs with an inherent capability to detect and flag potential hallucinations at the time of generation by calibrating their internal confidence signals against factual accuracy. Specifically, we will:  
• Design a supervised fine-tuning framework that aligns internal state–based confidence scores with ground-truth factuality labels.  
• Develop a contrastive learning objective that forces the model to distinguish factual statements from model-generated hallucinations using rich internal representations (e.g., hidden activations, attention patterns).  
• Integrate the calibrated confidence mechanism into the decoding process so that the model can proactively signal low‐confidence (potentially hallucinated) spans in real time.  

Significance  
A successful proactive hallucination detector will:  
• Increase user trust by allowing LLMs to self-annotate uncertainty rather than presenting all outputs as equally valid.  
• Reduce reliance on expensive external fact-checking pipelines or human reviewers.  
• Lay the groundwork for more robust, transparent, and safe LLM deployments in critical applications.  

2. Literature Review  
Internal Confidence Estimation  
InternalInspector (Beigi et al., 2024) uses contrastive learning over layer-wise internal states to better align confidence scores with prediction correctness. MIND (Su et al., 2024) integrates unsupervised real-time detection into inference, demonstrating the feasibility of internal-state–based hallucination flags without manual annotations. PRISM (Zhang et al., 2024) further improves cross-domain generalization by guiding internal structures with prompts.  

Confidence Calibration Techniques  
Calibrating LLM confidence via sample consistency (Lyu et al., 2024) and graph-based self-consistency (Li et al., 2024) shows that aggregating multiple outputs can improve calibration. UF Calibration (Zhang et al., 2024) decomposes confidence into “question uncertainty” and “answer fidelity.” Yet, these methods either require multiple forward passes (sampling) or auxiliary models, increasing computational cost.  

Contrastive Knowledge Refinement  
Adaptive Contrastive Learning (Li et al., 2025) actively refines model knowledge by constructing positive and negative samples, reducing hallucinations. TrueTeacher (Gekhman et al., 2023) demonstrates synthetic annotation of factuality using LLM teachers, enabling student models to learn factual consistency.  

Key Gaps  
• Most existing methods are post-hoc or require multiple samples or auxiliary networks, and thus are not tightly integrated with the decoding process.  
• Domain generalization of hallucination detectors remains challenging.  
• Few methods directly fine-tune the model’s internal confidence signals to align with factuality in a supervised fashion.  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Overview  
Our method, called ProActiveCal (Proactive Calibration), consists of three components:  
A. Data Preparation and Annotation  
B. Model Architecture with Confidence Head  
C. Joint Training with Generation and Contrastive Calibration  

3.2 Data Preparation and Annotation  
We construct a fine-tuning dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_i, y_i, h_i)\}_{i=1}^N$, where $x_i$ is a context or prompt, $y_i$ is a ground-truth factual continuation, and $h_i$ is a hallucinated continuation generated by a base LLM.  

1. Source Texts: Extract contexts from reliable corpora (e.g., Wikipedia, newswire).  
2. Ground-Truth Continuations: Use human–curated or knowledge-grounded templates to produce factual completions $y_i$.  
3. Hallucination Generation: Prompt a pretrained LLM to generate continuations, then use fact verification tools (e.g., FEVER) to select examples that are factually incorrect.  
4. Alignment: Token‐level alignments between $y_i$ (label “factual”) and $h_i$ (label “hallucinated”) allow us to assign binary labels $z_{i,t} \in \{0,1\}$ at each token position $t$.  

Dataset Statistics:  
• Number of examples $N\approx 200$K contexts, each with one factual and one hallucinated continuation.  
• Domain diversity: articles from science, history, finance, health.  

3.3 Model Architecture  
We start from a transformer‐based decoder LLM with $L$ layers. At each decoding step $t$, let $s_{i,t}^l \in \mathbb{R}^d$ denote the hidden state at layer $l\in\{1,\ldots,L\}$. We fuse these into a single representation:  
$$  
r_{i,t} = \mathrm{Fusion}\bigl(s_{i,t}^1, s_{i,t}^2, \ldots, s_{i,t}^L\bigr)\quad\in\mathbb{R}^d,  
$$  
where $\mathrm{Fusion}$ can be, for example, concatenation followed by a linear projection or a trainable attention mechanism over layers.  

Confidence Head  
A confidence head maps $r_{i,t}$ to a scalar confidence score $c_{i,t}\in[0,1]$:  
$$  
c_{i,t} = \sigma\bigl(W_c\,r_{i,t} + b_c\bigr),  
$$  
where $W_c\in\mathbb{R}^{1\times d}$, $b_c\in\mathbb{R}$, and $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.  

3.4 Training Objectives  
We optimize a multi‐task objective combining:  

1. Generation Loss  
Standard teacher‐forced cross‐entropy for predicting the next token $w_{i,t+1}$ given prefix:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{gen}} = -\sum_{i,t}\log p_{\theta}(w_{i,t+1}\mid x_i, w_{i,1:t})\,.  
$$  

2. Confidence Calibration Loss  
a) Supervised Binary Cross-Entropy  
For each token with factuality label $z_{i,t}\in\{0,1\}$:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{BCE}} = -\sum_{i,t}\bigl[z_{i,t}\log c_{i,t} + (1 - z_{i,t})\log(1 - c_{i,t})\bigr]\,.  
$$  

b) Contrastive Calibration Loss  
We treat each factual token as a “positive” and each hallucinated token as a “negative” anchor. For a mini-batch of size $B$, define representations $\{r_b^+\}_{b=1}^{B}$ (factual) and $\{r_b^-\}_{b=1}^{B}$ (hallucinated). We use a margin‐based contrastive loss:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ctr}} = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^{B}\max\bigl(0,\;m - (f(r_b^+) - f(r_b^-))\bigr)\,,  
$$  
where $f(r)=W_c\,r + b_c$ is the pre‐sigmoid score and $m>0$ is a margin hyperparameter.  

Total Loss  
$$  
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{gen}} + \lambda_{\mathrm{BCE}}\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{BCE}} + \lambda_{\mathrm{ctr}}\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ctr}},  
$$  
with weights $\lambda_{\mathrm{BCE}},\lambda_{\mathrm{ctr}}$ tuned on a validation set.  

3.5 Inference and Hallucination Flagging  
During beam or greedy decoding, at each token step $t$ we compute $c_t$. We then aggregate confidences over a span or a sentence, e.g., using the geometric mean  
$$  
\overline{c}_{t_1:t_2} = \left(\prod_{t=t_1}^{t_2} c_t\right)^{1/(t_2-t_1+1)}.  
$$  
If $\overline{c}_{t_1:t_2} < \tau$, where $\tau$ is a threshold calibrated on held‐out data, the model emits a special token “[UNCERTAIN]” or highlights the span as potentially hallucinated.  

3.6 Experimental Design

Evaluation Metrics  
• Detection performance: Precision, Recall, F1 for hallucination tokens/spans  
• Calibration error: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) over factuality labels  
• Generation quality: Perplexity, BLEU/ROUGE vs. ground truth  
• Inference latency overhead (milliseconds per token)  

Ablation Studies  
• Impact of $\mathrm{Fusion}$ module design (concatenation vs. attention)  
• Removal of contrastive loss ($\lambda_{\mathrm{ctr}}=0$)  
• Varying threshold $\tau$  
• Domain transfer: train on two domains, test on a third unseen domain  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate that ProActiveCal will:  
• Achieve at least a 15% relative improvement in F1 detection of hallucinated tokens compared to the strongest baseline (MIND) while maintaining similar perplexity on generation tasks.  
• Reduce calibration error (ECE) on factuality estimates by 30% relative to UF Calibration.  
• Operate with under 10% additional inference latency, making it viable for real-time applications.  
• Generalize across domains, retaining over 80% of in-domain detection performance when tested on unseen data sources.  

Broader Impact  
By equipping LLMs with proactive, built-in hallucination awareness, this research will:  
• Enhance user trust in AI systems by transparently communicating uncertainty.  
• Facilitate safer deployment in sensitive environments (medicine, finance, legal advice).  
• Inspire future work on integrating internal self-diagnosis modules in generative models, promoting a new paradigm of intrinsically reliable AI.
