# LLM Fact Verification Framework: Combating Hallucinations with Attribution

## Motivation
Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information—a phenomenon known as "hallucination." This undermines their reliability in critical applications such as education, healthcare, and legal contexts. Current approaches to fact verification often rely on secondary validation systems that add complexity and latency, or are limited to specific domains. A comprehensive framework that can verify diverse factual claims within the LLM architecture itself is urgently needed to build trustworthy AI systems and prevent the spread of misinformation.

## Main Idea
We propose an integrated fact verification framework that enables LLMs to simultaneously generate content and provide evidence-based attribution. The system introduces a novel dual-stream architecture where one stream generates content while the other retrieves and validates supporting evidence from a curated knowledge base. Key innovations include: (1) a differentiable attribution mechanism that links generated statements to source documents, (2) a confidence scoring system that quantifies uncertainty for different knowledge domains, and (3) a self-monitoring mechanism that flags potential hallucinations during generation. The framework includes a specialized fine-tuning procedure using contrastive learning to distinguish between factual and fabricated statements. This approach would dramatically reduce hallucinations while maintaining generation fluency, and provide users with transparency about the reliability of information—transforming LLMs from black boxes into accountable knowledge systems.
