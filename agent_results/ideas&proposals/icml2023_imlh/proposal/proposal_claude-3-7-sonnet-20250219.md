# Knowledge-Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Interpretable and Uncertainty-Aware Clinical Diagnosis

## Introduction

Healthcare is entering a new era with the integration of machine learning (ML) technologies, promising improved diagnostic accuracy, personalized treatment plans, and optimized resource allocation. However, the black-box nature of many sophisticated ML models poses significant challenges for clinical adoption. Unlike other domains, healthcare requires models that not only predict accurately but also explain their reasoning and express appropriate uncertaintyâ€”qualities essential for clinical trust, patient safety, and regulatory compliance.

The core challenges limiting the clinical integration of ML systems include: (1) insufficient interpretability that fails to align with clinical reasoning processes; (2) inadequate incorporation of established medical knowledge; and (3) unreliable or absent uncertainty quantification. Traditional deep learning approaches often sacrifice transparency for performance, creating a fundamental barrier to adoption in high-stakes medical environments where clinicians must justify decisions and understand model limitations.

This research aims to address these challenges by developing Knowledge-Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Interpretable and Uncertainty-Aware Clinical Diagnosis (KENGI-CD). Our approach will integrate structured medical knowledge graphs with advanced graph neural network architectures, while incorporating rigorous uncertainty quantification methods specifically calibrated for clinical applications.

The significance of this research extends beyond technical innovation to practical clinical impact. By creating diagnostic systems that provide explanations grounded in established medical knowledge and clearly communicate uncertainty, we aim to bridge the gap between algorithmic performance and clinical trust. Such systems have the potential to:

1. Facilitate more informed clinical decision-making by providing evidence-based explanations
2. Enhance patient safety by identifying cases where model predictions should be treated with caution
3. Improve clinician-AI collaboration by supporting rather than replacing human expertise
4. Accelerate regulatory approval by addressing interpretability requirements
5. Advance our understanding of disease mechanisms by highlighting previously unrecognized patterns in patient data

This research is particularly timely as healthcare systems worldwide face unprecedented pressures, making the responsible automation of routine diagnostic tasks increasingly important for sustainable healthcare delivery.

## Methodology

Our proposed methodology for developing Knowledge-Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Interpretable and Uncertainty-Aware Clinical Diagnosis (KENGI-CD) consists of four integrated components: (1) knowledge graph construction and integration, (2) graph neural network architecture development, (3) uncertainty quantification implementation, and (4) comprehensive evaluation through clinical validation. The following sections detail each component.

### 1. Medical Knowledge Graph Construction and Integration

We will construct a comprehensive medical knowledge graph that serves as the foundation for our diagnostic model. This graph will encode established medical knowledge from multiple authoritative sources.

**Data Sources:**
- UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) for standard medical terminology
- Disease-gene associations from DisGeNET
- Drug-disease relationships from DrugBank
- Symptom-disease associations from publicly available datasets
- Clinical pathways and guidelines from medical literature

**Graph Structure:**
The knowledge graph $G = (V, E)$ will consist of:
- Nodes $V = \{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\}$ representing medical entities (diseases, symptoms, tests, genes, drugs)
- Edges $E = \{e_{ij}\}$ representing relationships between entities with relations $r \in R$ (e.g., "causes," "indicates," "treats")

Each node $v_i$ will be associated with a feature vector $\mathbf{x}_i$ encoding relevant attributes, while each edge $e_{ij}$ will be labeled with relation type $r_{ij}$ and a weight $w_{ij}$ representing the strength of the relationship based on statistical co-occurrence or expert consensus.

**Patient Data Integration:**
For each patient $p$, we will create a personalized subgraph $G_p = (V_p, E_p)$ where:
- $V_p \subset V$ represents the subset of medical entities relevant to patient $p$
- $E_p \subset E$ represents the relationships between these entities

Patient-specific data from electronic health records (EHR) will be mapped to this subgraph, with observations activating corresponding nodes and modifying node features based on measured values.

**Mapping Procedure:**
1. Extract structured and unstructured data from patient EHR
2. Apply medical NLP techniques to standardize terminology
3. Map observations to corresponding nodes in the knowledge graph
4. For continuous measurements, encode values as node features
5. For categorical observations, create binary node activation values

### 2. Graph Neural Network Architecture

We propose a novel attention-based GNN architecture specifically designed for diagnostic reasoning with medical knowledge graphs.

**Model Architecture:**
Our model consists of multiple graph attention network (GAT) layers with knowledge-guided attention mechanisms. For each node $v_i$ in the patient-specific subgraph, the $l$-th layer computes:

$$\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)} = \sigma\left(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} \alpha_{ij}^{(l)} \mathbf{W}^{(l)} \mathbf{h}_j^{(l-1)}\right)$$

where:
- $\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}$ is the feature vector of node $v_i$ at layer $l$
- $\mathcal{N}_i$ is the set of neighbors of node $v_i$
- $\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$ is a learnable weight matrix
- $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function

The attention coefficients $\alpha_{ij}^{(l)}$ are computed as:

$$\alpha_{ij}^{(l)} = \frac{\exp\left(\text{LeakyReLU}\left(\mathbf{a}^T[\mathbf{W}^{(l)}\mathbf{h}_i^{(l-1)} \| \mathbf{W}^{(l)}\mathbf{h}_j^{(l-1)} \| \mathbf{r}_{ij}]\right)\right)}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}_i} \exp\left(\text{LeakyReLU}\left(\mathbf{a}^T[\mathbf{W}^{(l)}\mathbf{h}_i^{(l-1)} \| \mathbf{W}^{(l)}\mathbf{h}_k^{(l-1)} \| \mathbf{r}_{ik}]\right)\right)}$$

where $\mathbf{r}_{ij}$ is a learned embedding of the relation type $r_{ij}$, and $\|$ denotes concatenation.

**Knowledge-Guided Attention:**
We incorporate prior medical knowledge into the attention mechanism by introducing a knowledge guidance term:

$$\alpha_{ij}^{(l)} = \lambda \cdot \alpha_{ij}^{(l)} + (1-\lambda) \cdot k_{ij}$$

where $k_{ij}$ represents the normalized strength of the established medical relationship between entities $i$ and $j$, and $\lambda$ is a learnable parameter balancing learned and prior knowledge.

**Disease Classification:**
For the final disease prediction, we aggregate node representations through a readout function with emphasis on disease nodes:

$$\mathbf{z} = \sum_{i \in V_d} \beta_i \mathbf{h}_i^{(L)}$$

where $V_d$ is the set of disease nodes, $\mathbf{h}_i^{(L)}$ is the final representation of node $i$, and $\beta_i$ are learnable attention weights. The probability of each disease diagnosis $d$ is then computed as:

$$P(d|\mathbf{x}) = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{W}_d \mathbf{z} + \mathbf{b}_d)$$

### 3. Uncertainty Quantification

We will implement and compare two complementary approaches for uncertainty quantification:

**Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) Approach:**
Instead of directly predicting diagnosis probabilities, we model the parameters of a Dirichlet distribution over possible diagnoses. For each patient, our model outputs evidential parameters $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = [\alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_K]$ where $K$ is the number of possible diagnoses.

The predicted probability for diagnosis $k$ is given by:

$$p_k = \frac{\alpha_k}{S}$$

where $S = \sum_{i=1}^K \alpha_i$ is the strength of evidence.

The model's uncertainty can be quantified through:
- Aleatoric (data) uncertainty: $\mathcal{U}_a = \frac{K}{S}$
- Epistemic (model) uncertainty: $\mathcal{U}_e = \frac{K - \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{\alpha_k^2}{S^2}}{\sum_{k=1}^K \frac{\alpha_k^2}{S^2}}$
- Total predictive uncertainty: $\mathcal{U}_t = \mathcal{U}_a + \mathcal{U}_e$

The loss function for EDL training combines a standard classification loss with an evidence regularization term:

$$\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}, y) = \mathcal{L}_{NLL}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}, y) + \lambda \sum_{k=1}^K \mathbbm{1}[k \neq y](\alpha_k - 1)$$

where $y$ is the true diagnosis, $\mathcal{L}_{NLL}$ is the negative log-likelihood, and $\lambda$ is a regularization parameter.

**Conformal Prediction Approach:**
We will also implement a conformalized GNN (CF-GNN) approach for rigorous uncertainty quantification with coverage guarantees. The procedure involves:

1. Splitting the dataset into training, calibration, and test sets
2. Training the GNN model on the training set
3. Computing nonconformity scores for the calibration set:
   $$s_i = 1 - \hat{P}(y_i|\mathbf{x}_i)$$
   where $\hat{P}(y_i|\mathbf{x}_i)$ is the predicted probability for the true diagnosis
4. Determining the $(1-\alpha)$ quantile $q$ of the nonconformity scores
5. Constructing prediction sets for new patient data:
   $$C(\mathbf{x}) = \{y : 1 - \hat{P}(y|\mathbf{x}) \leq q\}$$

This approach provides prediction sets that contain the true diagnosis with a guaranteed coverage probability of $(1-\alpha)$.

### 4. Evaluation Framework

We will evaluate KENGI-CD through a comprehensive framework addressing accuracy, interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and clinical utility.

**Datasets:**
- MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV for critical care patient data
- UK Biobank for general population health data
- Disease-specific datasets for targeted evaluation (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, Alzheimer's disease)

**Experimental Design:**
1. Performance validation using 5-fold cross-validation
2. Comparison against baseline models:
   - Standard deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs)
   - Traditional GNNs without knowledge integration
   - Non-graph-based interpretable models (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression)

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Diagnostic Accuracy**: AUC-ROC, precision, recall, F1-score
- **Calibration**: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier score
- **Uncertainty Quality**:
  - Proper Scoring Rules: Negative Log-Likelihood, Continuous Ranked Probability Score
  - Uncertainty-Performance Curves: plotting model accuracy against uncertainty quantiles
  - Coverage and Width for conformal prediction sets
- **Interpretability Metrics**:
  - Faithfulness: correlation between feature importance and model output
  - Consistency: stability of explanations across similar cases
  - Sparsity: concentration of importance on clinically relevant features
- **Clinical Utility** (via expert evaluation):
  - Explanation Satisfaction: Likert-scale ratings from clinicians on explanation quality
  - Decision Influence: Assessment of how model outputs affect clinical decisions
  - Trust Score: Clinician ratings of trust in the model's diagnoses and uncertainty estimates

**Ablation Studies:**
We will conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component:
1. Removing the knowledge graph integration
2. Replacing the knowledge-guided attention with standard attention
3. Removing the uncertainty quantification components
4. Simplifying the graph structure to test specific relationship types
