### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Machine learning (ML) has shown remarkable success in healthcare applications, from disease diagnosis to treatment recommendation. However, the "black-box" nature of many ML models limits their clinical adoption, as physicians require transparent explanations and reliable confidence measures to trust automated predictions. Interpretability and uncertainty quantification are critical in healthcare, where errors can have life-threatening consequences. Current models often lack explicit grounding in medical knowledge or fail to distinguish between uncertainty arising from insufficient data (epistemic) and inherent noise (aleatoric). Integrating structured medical knowledge graphs (KGs) with graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising path toward interpretable and uncertainty-aware systems by aligning model reasoning with clinical workflows.

**Research Objectives**  
1. Develop a GNN framework that integrates medical KGs to generate diagnoses with evidence-based explanations.  
2. Incorporate uncertainty quantification methods (conformal prediction and evidential deep learning) to provide reliable confidence scores.  
3. Validate the modelâ€™s interpretability through clinician feedback and its uncertainty estimates through rigorous statistical guarantees.  

**Significance**  
This research bridges the gap between high-performing ML models and clinically actionable tools. By embedding medical knowledge and quantifying uncertainty, the framework will enhance trust, reduce diagnostic errors, and accelerate the deployment of AI in healthcare. It addresses key challenges identified in recent literature, including KG integration, interpretability aligned with clinical reasoning, and robust uncertainty estimation.

### 3. **Methodology**  
**3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
- **Data Sources**:  
  - **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)**: MIMIC-III and eICU datasets for patient demographics, lab results, and diagnoses.  
  - **Imaging Data**: CheXpert chest X-rays with radiology reports.  
  - **Medical Knowledge Graph**: Constructed from UMLS, SNOMED-CT, and Disease-Symptom databases, with nodes representing symptoms, diseases, tests, and genes, and edges encoding relationships (e.g., *symptom_of*, *treated_by*).  

- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Map patient data to KG nodes (e.g., lab results to biochemical markers, imaging features to anatomical terms).  
  - Handle missing data via graph imputation using neighborhood aggregation.  

**3.2 Model Architecture**  
The framework comprises three modules:  
1. **Knowledge Graph Embedding**:  
   - Represent KG entities as embeddings using TransE:  
     $$h_e = f_{\text{TransE}}(h_{\text{head}}, h_{\text{relation}}, h_{\text{tail}}),$$  
     where $h_{\text{head}} + h_{\text{relation}} \approx h_{\text{tail}}$.  

2. **Graph Neural Network with Attention**:  
   - Propagate patient-specific data through the KG using a GNN with regularized attention:  
     $$h_v^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} \alpha_{vu}^{(l)} W^{(l)} h_u^{(l)}\right),$$  
     where $\alpha_{vu}$ is the attention weight between nodes $v$ and $u$, regularized via sparsity constraints to reduce noise.  

3. **Uncertainty Quantification**:  
   - **Conformal Prediction**: Generate prediction sets $\mathcal{C}(x)$ for diagnosis $y$ with coverage guarantee:  
     $$\mathbb{P}(y \in \mathcal{C}(x)) \geq 1 - \alpha.$$  
     Use topology-aware calibration from CF-GNN to adapt to graph structure.  
   - **Evidential Learning**: Output Dirichlet parameters $(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_K)$ for epistemic uncertainty:  
     $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{EDL}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}} + \lambda \cdot \text{KL}\left(\text{Dir}(\alpha) \| \text{Dir}([1, \dots, 1])\right).$$  

**3.3 Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against standard GNNs, attention-GNNs, and interpretable models (e.g., logistic regression with SHAP).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Accuracy**: AUROC, F1-score.  
  - **Interpretability**: Fidelity (agreement between model explanations and ground-truth clinical criteria), clinician assessment via Likert scale.  
  - **Uncertainty**: Prediction set size (efficiency) and coverage for conformal methods; entropy and calibration error for evidential learning.  
- **Validation**: Collaborate with clinicians to evaluate explanations and uncertainty reports on 100+ retrospective cases.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. A GNN framework that generates diagnoses with attention-based explanations (e.g., highlighting key symptoms or lab results).  
2. Statistically valid uncertainty estimates via conformal prediction and evidential learning, achieving >90% coverage with minimal prediction set size.  
3. Clinician-validated interpretability, with >80% agreement between model explanations and expert reasoning.  

**Impact**  
- **Clinical Trust**: Transparent explanations and reliable uncertainty scores will foster clinician trust, addressing a key barrier to AI adoption.  
- **Safety**: Uncertainty-aware predictions reduce overconfidence in edge cases (e.g., rare diseases).  
- **Methodological Advancements**: Integration of KGs and uncertainty quantification sets a new standard for interpretable medical AI.

### 5. **Conclusion**  
This proposal outlines a novel framework for interpretable and uncertainty-aware clinical decision support. By grounding predictions in medical knowledge and quantifying uncertainty, the model aligns with clinical reasoning while providing robust statistical guarantees. Successful implementation will advance the deployment of trustworthy AI in healthcare, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing diagnostic errors.
