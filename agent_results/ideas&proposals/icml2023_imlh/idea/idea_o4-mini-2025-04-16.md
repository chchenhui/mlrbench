Title: ProtoCast—Prototype-Based Explanations via Clinical Knowledge Graphs

Motivation:  
Current deep models for clinical prediction are accurate but opaque, limiting physician trust and regulatory approval. By grounding predictions in familiar clinical substructures (“prototypes”) extracted from a medical knowledge graph, we can bridge black-box inference and human reasoning, improving verifiability, bias detection, and adoption in high-stakes healthcare settings.

Main Idea:  
We construct a large-scale medical knowledge graph (e.g., UMLS + EHR co-occurrence) and use contrastive graph representation learning to distill a small set of disease‐relevant subgraph prototypes (symptom clusters, lab patterns, drug interactions). A Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder maps patient data into this prototype space; prediction proceeds by measuring similarity to each prototype. At inference, the model returns top-k matching prototypes alongside prediction scores, providing clinicians with concrete, medically interpretable “case archetypes” and their supporting graph paths. We will evaluate on tasks like sepsis onset and heart-failure readmission, comparing accuracy and prototype interpretability versus black-box baselines, and assess clinical utility through physician surveys. ProtoCast aims to deliver transparent, bias-aware diagnostic support aligned with clinical reasoning.
