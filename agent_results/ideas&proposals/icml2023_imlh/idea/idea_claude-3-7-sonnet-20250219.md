# Uncertainty-Aware Attention Maps for Critical Care Decision Support

## Motivation
Machine learning models in critical care settings often make predictions that clinicians struggle to trust due to limited explainability. Current black-box approaches fail to communicate prediction confidence alongside explanations, which is crucial when decisions may be life-threatening. Clinicians need to understand not just what features drove a prediction, but also when the model might be unreliable. This research addresses the urgent need for interpretability methods that explicitly integrate uncertainty quantification with visual explanations in time-sensitive clinical contexts.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel dual-channel attention visualization framework that simultaneously highlights influential features and their associated uncertainty. Our approach combines Bayesian neural networks with attention mechanisms to generate heatmaps over medical images or patient data where color intensity indicates feature importance, while transparency/texture patterns represent prediction uncertainty. This method introduces "uncertainty-aware attention maps" that visually flag when a model is operating outside its confidence region. For implementation, we'll develop a dropout-based ensemble approach that estimates uncertainty during inference without requiring model retraining, making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained healthcare environments. The system will be evaluated through both technical validation and physician feedback studies comparing decision quality and trust with and without uncertainty-aware explanations, potentially transforming how clinicians interact with AI assistance in critical care settings.
