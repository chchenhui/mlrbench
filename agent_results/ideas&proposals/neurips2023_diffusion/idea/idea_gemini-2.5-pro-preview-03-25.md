**Title:** Adaptive Timestep Diffusion Sampling via Predictive Variance Estimation

**Motivation:** Diffusion model inference typically relies on a fixed, large number of timesteps, resulting in slow generation speeds. Accelerating inference by simply reducing steps often degrades sample quality. This research aims to accelerate sampling by dynamically adjusting the step sizes during the reverse process, allocating computation more efficiently.

**Main Idea:** We propose an adaptive timestep sampling strategy for diffusion models. Instead of uniform steps, the size of the next reverse diffusion step is determined based on the estimated local variance or prediction uncertainty of the denoising network at the current timestep. A small, efficient auxiliary network, trained concurrently or post-hoc, predicts this uncertainty. If the predicted variance/uncertainty is low, a larger step is taken, skipping intermediate computations. If high, a smaller, standard step size is used for finer refinement. This allows the sampler to move quickly through stable regions of the trajectory and carefully navigate complex, high-variance transitions, achieving significant speedups (e.g., 2-4x) with minimal loss in sample fidelity compared to fixed-step solvers.
