# Injective Neural ODE-based Conditional Diffusion Models for Scalable Inversion and Precise Image Editing  

---

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Background and Motivation  
Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for generative modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results in image, video, and audio synthesis. Their forward process corrupts data with progressively added noise, while the reverse process learns to denoise the data to recover the original distribution. However, a critical limitation of existing diffusion models lies in their inability to perform **exact inversion**—that is, deterministic recovery of corrupted observations (e.g., blurred, missing, or noisy regions) without iterative optimization. This restricts their applicability in domains requiring high fidelity and deterministic outcomes, such as medical imaging, forensic reconstruction, and industrial design. While recent advances like EDICT [4], BDIA [3], and ERDDCI [1] have improved inversion quality, they rely on approximations (e.g., local linearization or dual-chain coupling) that lack theoretical guarantees of injectivity (i.e., one-to-one mapping between inputs and outputs).  

The problem of exact inversion is closely tied to solving **inverse problems** (e.g., deblurring, inpainting) where generative models are used to regularize solutions. Current approaches either fine-tune the diffusion model for specific tasks [5] or impose constraints on the latent code [6]. These methods often compromise computational efficiency or require task-specific architectures. A principled solution requires rethinking the diffusion process to ensure injectivity—allowing exact inversion without optimization heuristics—while maintaining scalability and controllability for image editing.

### 1.2 Research Objectives  
This research aims to address these challenges through three core objectives:  
1. **Design an injective Neural ODE-based diffusion architecture** that guarantees exact inversion via deterministic ODE reversal, avoiding iterative optimization.  
2. **Develop a conditional denoising framework** that maps corrupted inputs to noise and enables targeted latent-space edits for precise image manipulation.  
3. **Theoretically analyze the invertibility and stability** of the proposed model, with empirical validation on diverse inverse problems (e.g., inpainting, deblurring) and high-resolution datasets.  

### 1.3 Significance  
By bridging the gap between diffusion models and deterministic inversion, this work has the potential to:  
- Enable **high-fidelity reconstruction** in safety-critical applications (e.g., medical imaging), where approximation errors are unacceptable.  
- Simplify image editing workflows by allowing **geometrically coherent edits** through localized updates to Neural ODE hidden states.  
- Advance theoretical understanding of invertible diffusion processes, addressing key challenges identified in recent literature [7][10].

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Model Architecture  
We propose an **injective Neural ODE-based diffusion model** with Lipschitz-regularized score networks. The architecture comprises two components:  
1. **Neural ODE Forward Process**: A deterministic, injective mapping from data space to noise space.  
2. **Conditional Denoising Network**: A Lipschitz-constrained score network that ensures stability during inversion.  

#### 2.1.1 Neural ODE Forward Process  
The forward process is defined as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) parameterized by a neural network $ f_\theta $:  
$$
\frac{d\mathbf{h}(t)}{dt} = f_\theta(\mathbf{h}(t), t), \quad \mathbf{h}(0) = \mathbf{x}_0,
$$  
where $ \mathbf{x}_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d $ is the input image, $ \mathbf{h}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^d $ is the latent state at time $ t \in [0, T] $, and $ \theta $ are learnable parameters.  

To ensure injectivity, $ f_\theta $ must satisfy the **Lipschitz condition**:  
$$
\left\| f_\theta(\mathbf{h}_1, t) - f_\theta(\mathbf{h}_2, t) \right\| \leq L \left\| \mathbf{h}_1 - \mathbf{h}_2 \right\|,
$$  
where $ L < \infty $. This guarantees a unique solution to the ODE and ensures the forward map $ \Phi_T: \mathbf{x}_0 \mapsto \mathbf{h}(T) $ is bijective (i.e., invertible).  

#### 2.1.2 Lipschitz-Regularized Score Network  
The denoising network predicts the score function $ \nabla_{\mathbf{h}(t)} \log p(\mathbf{h}(t)) $, which guides the reverse process. We regularize its Lipschitz constant by enforcing:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Lip}} = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{h}, t} \left[ \max\left(0, \frac{\left\| \nabla_{\mathbf{h}(t)} \hat{s}_\phi(\mathbf{h}(t), t) \right\|}{\lambda_{\max}} - 1 \right) \right],
$$  
where $ \hat{s}_\phi $ is the neural network output, $ \phi $ are parameters, and $ \lambda_{\max} $ is a hyperparameter. This prevents gradient instabilities during inversion [6].  

---

### 2.2 Conditional Denoising Objective  
The model is trained on a conditional denoising objective. Given a corrupted input $ \mathbf{x}_c $ (e.g., an image with missing regions), we define a conditional forward process that injects information about $ \mathbf{x}_c $ into the Neural ODE dynamics:  
$$
\frac{d\mathbf{h}(t)}{dt} = f_\theta(\mathbf{h}(t), \mathbf{x}_c, t).
$$  
The loss function is:  
$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_c, t, \epsilon} \left[ \left\| \hat{\epsilon}_\phi(\mathbf{h}(t), \mathbf{x}_c, t) - \epsilon \right\|^2 \right],
$$  
where $ \mathbf{h}(t) $ is obtained by solving the ODE with initial condition $ \mathbf{x}_0 $, and $ \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I}) $ is Gaussian noise.  

---

### 2.3 Exact Inversion via ODE Reversal  
For inversion, we solve the backward ODE:  
$$
\frac{d\mathbf{h}(t)}{dt} = -f_\theta(\mathbf{h}(t), \mathbf{x}_c, T - t),
$$  
initialized at $ \mathbf{h}(0) = \mathbf{x}_c $. The injectivity of $ \Phi_T $ ensures that the trajectory converges to the ground-truth input $ \mathbf{x}_0 $ without ambiguity [10].  

---

### 2.4 Image Editing via Latent State Updates  
Localized edits (e.g., inscribing text) are achieved by perturbing the hidden state $ \mathbf{h}(t) $ in targeted spatial regions. Let $ \mathcal{R} \subset \{1, \dots, d\} $ denote the indices of pixels to modify. We update $ \mathbf{h}(t) $ as:  
$$
\mathbf{h}_{\mathcal{R}}^{\text{edited}}(t) = \mathbf{h}_{\mathcal{R}}(t) + \Delta \mathbf{z}, \quad \Delta \mathbf{z} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\text{edit}}^2 \mathbf{I}),
$$  
where $ \sigma_{\text{edit}} $ controls edit intensity. The modified state is propagated through the reverse ODE to generate the edited image.

### 2.5 Experimental Design

- **Datasets**: ImageNet [11], CelebA-HQ [12], and medical imaging datasets (e.g., BraTS [13]).  
- **Corruptions**: Gaussian blur, random masks, and salt-and-pepper noise.  

#### 2.5.2 Baselines  
- EDICT [4], BDIA [3], Negative-prompt Inversion [2], and conditional DDPM [9].  

#### 2.5.3 Evaluation Metrics  
- **Inversion Quality**: PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS (lower values for LPIPS indicate better perceptual quality).  
- **Edit Coherence**: Semantic segmentation accuracy (e.g., for text inscription tasks).  
- **Computational Efficiency**: Inversion runtime (seconds/image).  

#### 2.5.4 Implementation Details  
- **Network Architecture**: U-Net backbone with Lipschitz-constrained residual blocks [6].  
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with $ \beta_1=0.9 $, $ \beta_2=0.99 $, and $ \eta=2 \times 10^{-4} $.  
- **Training**: 1000 epochs on 256×256 crops.
