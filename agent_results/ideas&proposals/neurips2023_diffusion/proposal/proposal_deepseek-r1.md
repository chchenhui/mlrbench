# Research Proposal: Injective Neural ODE-based Conditional Diffusion Models for Scalable Inversion and Precise Image Editing  

---

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling by offering high-quality synthesis across domains such as images, video, and scientific data. A key challenge, however, lies in their ability to invert corrupted observations (e.g., blurred regions, masked pixels) *exactly* and *efficiently*. Current approaches often rely on iterative optimization (e.g., DDIM inversion) or approximate methods, which lack theoretical guarantees and compromise fidelity in critical applications like medical imaging and forensic analysis. Recent works (e.g., EDICT, Negative-prompt Inversion) address inversion via coupled transformations or fast approximations but remain limited by their reliance on stochastic processes or linearization assumptions.  

### Research Objectives  
This research proposes a novel framework to unify deterministic inversion and precise image editing within diffusion models by leveraging **injective Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)**. The objectives are:  
1. Design an *injective diffusion architecture* via Lipschitz-regularized Neural ODEs to preserve information during the forward process.  
2. Enable **exact inversion** of corrupted observations (e.g., partial inputs, noise masks) without iterative optimization.  
3. Achieve **localized image editing** by manipulating latent diffusion states along geometrically coherent trajectories.  
4. Establish theoretical guarantees for injectivity and stability through Lipschitz constraints.  

### Significance  
Exact inversion in diffusion models is crucial for applications requiring deterministic reproducibility, such as medical image reconstruction, where pixel-level fidelity impacts clinical decisions. By combining the flexibility of diffusion models with the invertibility of Neural ODEs, this work bridges probabilistic inference and deterministic inversion. Furthermore, localized editing capabilities will advance computer-aided design (CAD) and creative tools by enabling targeted modifications (e.g., object recoloring, text insertion) without global artifacts.

## 2. Methodology  

### Research Design  
#### Data Collection  
- **Training Data**: Use publicly available datasets (e.g., FFHQ, ImageNet) and apply synthetic corruptions (e.g., Gaussian noise, masked regions, motion blur).  
- **Validation**: Benchmark on medical imaging datasets (e.g., BraTS for MRI) and high-resolution CAD renderings.  

#### Model Architecture  
1. **Injective Neural ODE Framework**:  
   The forward diffusion process is modeled as a Neural ODE with injective mappings to ensure invertibility. Let $\mathbf{z}_t$ denote the latent state at time $t \in [0, T]$. The dynamics are governed by:  
   $$  
   \frac{d\mathbf{z}_t}{dt} = f_\theta(\mathbf{z}_t, \mathbf{c}, t),  
   $$  
   where $f_\theta$ is a Lipschitz-constrained neural network, and $\mathbf{c}$ is a corruption-conditioning vector. Injectivity is enforced via architectural choices (e.g., coupling layers) and spectral normalization.  

2. **Lipschitz-Regularized Score Network**:  
   The score network $s_\phi(\mathbf{z}_t, \mathbf{c}, t)$ is trained to estimate the noise component in corrupted inputs. To ensure stability, we apply spectral normalization and a Lipschitz penalty:  
   $$  
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{Lip}} = \max_{\mathbf{z}_t, \mathbf{z}'_t} \frac{\|s_\phi(\mathbf{z}_t, \mathbf{c}, t) - s_\phi(\mathbf{z}'_t, \mathbf{c}, t)\|}{\|\mathbf{z}_t - \mathbf{z}'_t\|}.  
   $$  

3. **Conditional Training Objective**:  
   The model is trained to map corrupted inputs $\mathbf{x}_{\text{corrupted}}$ to noise $\epsilon$ using a denoising loss:  
   $$  
   \mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}, \epsilon, t} \left[ \|\epsilon - s_\phi(\mathbf{z}_t, \mathbf{c}, t)\|^2 \right] + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{Lip}}.  
   $$  

#### Inversion and Editing Process  
1. **Exact Inversion**: Given a corrupted observation $\mathbf{x}_{\text{corrupted}}$, solve the Neural ODE backward from $t=T$ to $t=0$:  
   $$  
   \mathbf{x}_{\text{clean}} = \mathbf{z}_0 = \mathbf{z}_T - \int_T^0 f_\theta(\mathbf{z}_t, \mathbf{c}, t) \, dt.  
   $$  
   Theoretical injectivity ensures $\mathbf{x}_{\text{clean}}$ is uniquely recoverable without approximation.  

2. **Localized Editing**: Modify specific regions of $\mathbf{z}_t$ during inversion (e.g., apply a color shift to object masks in latent space) and propagate changes through the ODE solver to generate edited images with geometric consistency.  

#### Experimental Design  
- **Baselines**: Compare against EDICT, Negative-prompt Inversion, and ERDDCI on inversion fidelity and speed.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Reconstruction Quality**: PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS between $\mathbf{x}_{\text{clean}}$ and ground truth.  
  - **Inversion Time**: Wall-clock time for single-sample inversion.  
  - **Editing Precision**: User studies and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) for edited vs. target distributions.  
- **Ablation Studies**: Test the impact of Lipschitz regularization and injective layers on inversion stability.
