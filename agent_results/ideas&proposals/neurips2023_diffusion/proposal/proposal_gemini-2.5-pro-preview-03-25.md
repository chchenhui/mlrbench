**1. Title:** Injective Neural ODE-based Conditional Diffusion Models for Scalable Inversion and Precise Image Editing

**2. Introduction**

**(Background)**
Diffusion probabilistic models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021) have emerged as a dominant paradigm in generative modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results in synthesizing high-fidelity images, audio, video, and even complex scientific data like molecules and 3D shapes. These models typically operate by defining a forward diffusion process that gradually adds noise to data, transforming it into a simple prior distribution (usually Gaussian noise), and then learning a reverse process that denoises the prior samples back into data samples. While highly successful for unconditional generation, extending diffusion models to conditional tasks, particularly those requiring precise reconstruction from corrupted or partial observations (i.e., solving inverse problems), presents significant challenges.

Inverse problems, such as image inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, or medical image reconstruction from sensor measurements, are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Applying standard diffusion models to these tasks often involves conditioning the reverse process on the observed data $\mathbf{y}$. However, common approaches rely on iterative optimization techniques (e.g., RePaint (Lugmayr et al., 2022), DDNM (Wang et al., 2022)), stochastic sampling with guidance, or approximations within the diffusion process itself. These methods often lack guarantees of exact reconstruction, can be computationally expensive due to iterative refinement, and may introduce artifacts or fail to preserve fine details present in the original signal, especially when the corruption is severe. This limits their applicability in domains demanding high fidelity and determinism, such as medical imaging for diagnosis or forensic image analysis.

Recent research has explored pathways towards more exact and efficient inversion within the diffusion framework. Methods like EDICT (Wallace et al., 2022) use coupled transformations inspired by normalizing flows, ERDDCI (Dai et al., 2024) employs dual chains, and BDIA (Zhang et al., 2023) uses bi-directional integration approximations to improve inversion accuracy. Negative-prompt Inversion (Miyake et al., 2023) offers fast inversion without optimization but focuses on text-guided editing. While these represent significant progress, many still rely on specific assumptions (e.g., local linearization implicitly) or architectural choices that might not guarantee strict injectivity throughout the entire diffusion trajectory, particularly when learned latent dynamics are involved. Furthermore, ensuring theoretical guarantees for stability and invertibility remains an active area of research, with techniques like Lipschitz regularization showing promise (Davis et al., 2023).

Separately, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) (Chen et al., 2018) offer a continuous-time modeling framework where transformations are defined by the solution path of an ODE governed by a neural network. Their inherent structure allows for deterministic and potentially invertible mappings if the defining vector field satisfies certain conditions. Leveraging Neural ODEs within generative models, particularly in conjunction with principles from invertible neural networks (Johnson et al., 2023; Adams et al., 2023), presents a compelling avenue for designing diffusion-like processes with built-in invertibility. Prior work has started exploring this direction (Green et al., 2023; Miller et al., 2023; Martinez et al., 2023), suggesting the potential for exact inversion.

**(Research Objectives)**
This research aims to bridge the gap between the generative power of diffusion models and the requirement for exact, deterministic inversion for inverse problems and precise image editing. We propose to develop a novel framework, **Injective Conditional Neural ODE Diffusion (ICNOD)**, based on formulating the diffusion process as an injective Neural ODE. The primary objectives are:

1.  **Design an Injective Neural ODE Architecture:** Develop a specific Neural ODE architecture where the underlying neural network defining the vector field guarantees injectivity of the flow map from time $t=0$ (data) to $t=T$ (latent/noise). This ensures that distinct inputs map to distinct outputs, preserving information.
2.  **Develop a Conditional Training Strategy:** Formulate a conditional denoising objective suitable for the Neural ODE framework, where the model learns the dynamics conditioned on corrupted observations $\mathbf{y}$.
3.  **Incorporate Lipschitz Regularization:** Systematically integrate Lipschitz constraints on the Neural ODE's vector field network to ensure stability, guarantee the existence and uniqueness of ODE solutions, and explicitly support the theoretical guarantees of invertibility.
4.  **Achieve Exact and Deterministic Inversion:** Demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that the trained ICNOD model can perform exact inversion of various corruption types (e.g., inpainting, deblurring) by solving the reverse ODE deterministically, without resorting to iterative optimization or stochastic sampling during inference.
5.  **Enable Precise Localized Editing:** Develop techniques to manipulate the intermediate latent states $\mathbf{x}(t)$ (where $0 < t < T$) within the deterministic ODE trajectory, allowing for targeted, localized image edits (e.g., object modification, text insertion) while maintaining global coherence.
6.  **Evaluate Scalability and Performance:** Assess the proposed model's performance on standard image datasets and potentially specialized datasets (e.g., medical images), comparing its fidelity, computational efficiency, and editing capabilities against state-of-the-art diffusion-based and other relevant methods.

**(Significance)**
This research promises significant advancements in both the theory and application of diffusion models.
*   **Theoretical Contribution:** It offers a principled way to construct diffusion-like generative models with inherent invertibility guarantees by leveraging the mathematical framework of injective Neural ODEs and Lipschitz continuity. This contributes to a deeper understanding of the connections between SDE/ODE-based generative models, invertible normalizing flows, and variational inference.
*   **Practical Advancement:** By enabling exact and deterministic inversion, ICNOD could unlock critical applications in domains like medical imaging (e.g., artifact-free MRI reconstruction), forensic science (e.g., reliable image enhancement), and computer-aided design (CAD) where fidelity is paramount.
*   **Enhanced Controllability:** The deterministic nature of the reverse process, combined with latent space manipulation techniques, is expected to provide finer-grained control over image editing compared to stochastic methods, leading to more predictable and coherent results.
*   **Addressing Workshop Themes:** This work directly addresses several key themes of the Workshop on Diffusion Models, including theory and methodology (SDEs/ODEs, probabilistic inference, novel architectures, theoretical properties), limitations (addressing inversion issues), and applications (conditional generation, inverse problems, image editing). It tackles key challenges identified in the literature review regarding exact inversion, theoretical guarantees, and localized editing.

**3. Methodology**

**(Theoretical Framework: Injective Conditional Neural ODE Diffusion - ICNOD)**

We propose modeling the transformation from data $\mathbf{x}_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d$ to a latent representation $\mathbf{x}_T$ (approximately standard Gaussian) using a deterministic Neural ODE defined over a time interval $[0, T]$:
$$
\frac{d\mathbf{x}(t)}{dt} = \mathbf{f}_\theta(\mathbf{x}(t), t) \quad \text{with initial condition } \mathbf{x}(0) = \mathbf{x}_0
$$
The core idea is to design the network $\mathbf{f}_\theta: \mathbb{R}^d \times [0, T] \to \mathbb{R}^d$ such that the resulting flow map $\Phi_T: \mathbf{x}_0 \mapsto \mathbf{x}(T)$ is injective. This means if $\mathbf{x}_0 \neq \mathbf{x}'_0$, then $\Phi_T(\mathbf{x}_0) \neq \Phi_T(\mathbf{x}'_0)$. This property ensures no information is lost during the forward transformation.

*   **Injectivity:** We will enforce injectivity by constructing $\mathbf{f}_\theta$ using architectures known to produce invertible maps when integrated, drawing inspiration from continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and invertible residual networks. A potential approach is to parameterize $\mathbf{f}_\theta$ using layers that satisfy specific constraints, such as ensuring the Jacobian $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}(t)} \mathbf{f}_\theta(\mathbf{x}(t), t)$ has eigenvalues restricted to a certain range (e.g., using spectral normalization or specialized activation functions). Alternatively, we can use architectures based on coupling layers adapted for the ODE context.

*   **Lipschitz Regularization:** To ensure theoretical guarantees (existence, uniqueness of solutions) and numerical stability during ODE integration, and to aid in proving invertibility, we will enforce a Lipschitz constraint on $\mathbf{f}_\theta$ with respect to $\mathbf{x}(t)$. We will explore techniques such as spectral normalization on the weights of $\mathbf{f}_\theta$ or adding a gradient penalty term to the loss function: $R(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}, t} [\| \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \mathbf{f}_\theta(\mathbf{x}(t), t) \|^p_F]$, where $\| \cdot \|_F$ is the Frobenius norm and $p$ is typically 1 or 2.

*   **Conditional Modeling:** We consider inverse problems where we observe a corrupted version $\mathbf{y} = M(\mathbf{x}_0)$, with $M$ being a known (potentially non-invertible) corruption operator (e.g., masking, blurring kernel). We aim to learn the *reverse* process that reconstructs $\mathbf{x}_0$ from $\mathbf{y}$. Since the forward ODE is deterministic and invertible, the reverse process is simply:
$$
\frac{d\mathbf{x}(t)}{dt} = -\mathbf{f}_\theta(\mathbf{x}(t), t) \quad \text{integrating from } t=T \text{ down to } t=0
$$
However, we only have $\mathbf{y}$, not the corresponding latent $\mathbf{x}_T$. We propose to train $\mathbf{f}_\theta$ not just to map data to noise, but implicitly to learn dynamics consistent with a conditional distribution $p(\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{y})$. We adapt the training objective. Instead of directly modeling $p(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_0)$, we train the network $\mathbf{f}_\theta$ (which represents the velocity field) to be consistent with the score of the conditional perturbation kernel, perhaps using a conditional denoising score matching-like objective adapted for ODEs. Let $p_t(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{y})$ be the distribution of perturbed data at time $t$ given observation $\mathbf{y}$. We train $\mathbf{f}_\theta$ (or a related network representing the score/velocity) to minimize an objective like:
$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{x}_0)} \mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}_0)} \mathbb{E}_{t \sim \mathcal{U}(0, T)} \mathbb{E}_{p_t(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_0)} \left[ w(t) \| \mathbf{s}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t, \mathbf{y}) - \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t} \log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_0) \|^2 \right] + \lambda R(\theta)
$$
where $\mathbf{s}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t, \mathbf{y})$ is the network output (potentially related to $\mathbf{f}_\theta$), $p_t(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_0)$ is derived from the forward ODE path, $w(t)$ is a weighting function, and $R(\theta)$ is the Lipschitz regularization term. The crucial part is that the prediction network $\mathbf{s}_\theta$ (or $\mathbf{f}_\theta$) is conditioned on $\mathbf{y}$. This conditioning guides the reverse ODE trajectory towards solutions consistent with $\mathbf{y}$.

*   **Inversion Process:** Given a corrupted observation $\mathbf{y}$, the inversion process involves:
    1.  Sampling an initial latent state $\mathbf{x}_T$ from the prior distribution $p_T \approx \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$.
    2.  Solving the reverse ODE deterministically from $t=T$ to $t=0$, using the learned conditional velocity field $-\mathbf{f}_\theta(\mathbf{x}(t), t, \mathbf{y})$ (where $\mathbf{f}$ depends on $\mathbf{s}_\theta$ and conditioning $\mathbf{y}$).
    $$
    \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0 = \text{ODESolve}(\mathbf{x}_T, -\mathbf{f}_\theta(\cdot, \cdot, \mathbf{y}), T, 0)
    $$
    The injectivity of the underlying (unconditional) flow map, combined with proper conditional training, aims to ensure that this deterministic backward path converges to the correct $\mathbf{x}_0$ consistent with $\mathbf{y}$, providing "exact" inversion without optimization needed at inference time.

*   **Editing Process:**
    1.  Given an image $\mathbf{x}_0$ to edit and an edit instruction (e.g., a mask $m$ and a target attribute/content description $c$).
    2.  (Optional but potentially useful) Compute the forward ODE trajectory to obtain intermediate latent states $\mathbf{x}(t)$ for $t \in (0, T]$. Since the forward ODE is deterministic, this gives a unique path.
    3.  Select an intermediate time $t_{edit} \in (0, T)$.
    4.  Modify the latent state $\mathbf{x}(t_{edit})$ based on the edit instruction. For localized edits defined by mask $m$, modify only the components of $\mathbf{x}(t_{edit})$ corresponding spatially to $m$. The modification can be guided by $c$ (e.g., using CLIP guidance on the tangent space or directly altering values). Let the modified state be $\mathbf{x}'(t_{edit})$.
    5.  Solve the reverse ODE from $t=t_{edit}$ down to $t=0$, starting from $\mathbf{x}'(t_{edit})$, using the conditional dynamics $-\mathbf{f}_\theta(\mathbf{x}(t), t, \mathbf{y}')$ where $\mathbf{y}'$ might be the original image or related context for the edit.
    $$
    \hat{\mathbf{x}}'_0 = \text{ODESolve}(\mathbf{x}'(t_{edit}), -\mathbf{f}_\theta(\cdot, \cdot, \mathbf{y}'), t_{edit}, 0)
    $$
    The deterministic nature of the ODE solver ensures that the modification smoothly propagates to the final image $\hat{\mathbf{x}}'_0$, preserving coherence in unedited regions.

**(Algorithmic Steps)**

1.  **Training ICNOD:**
    *   Sample a clean image $\mathbf{x}_0$ from the training dataset.
    *   Generate a corresponding corrupted observation $\mathbf{y} = M(\mathbf{x}_0)$.
    *   Sample a time $t \sim \mathcal{U}(0, T)$.
    *   Compute the perturbed state $\mathbf{x}_t = \text{ODESolve}(\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{f}_\theta, 0, t)$ (or use an approximation for efficiency, e.g., $\mathbf{x}_t = \alpha_t \mathbf{x}_0 + \sigma_t \epsilon$ based on an equivalent noise schedule if ODE solve is too slow).
    *   Compute the target score/velocity (e.g., $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t} \log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_0)$, often approximated as $-\epsilon / \sigma_t$ for simple noise).
    *   Predict the score/velocity using the network $\mathbf{s}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t, \mathbf{y})$ (which depends on $\mathbf{f}_\theta$).
    *   Compute the weighted loss $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$ including the conditional score matching term and the Lipschitz regularization term $R(\theta)$.
    *   Update parameters $\theta$ using gradient descent.

2.  **Inference (Inversion):**
    *   Input: Corrupted image $\mathbf{y}$.
    *   Sample $\mathbf{x}_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$.
    *   Use a numerical ODE solver (e.g., Dormand-Prince, Euler) to integrate the reverse ODE $d\mathbf{x}/dt = -\mathbf{f}_\theta(\mathbf{x}(t), t, \mathbf{y})$ from $t=T$ to $t=0$.
    *   Output: Reconstructed image $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0 = \mathbf{x}(0)$.

3.  **Inference (Editing):**
    *   Input: Image $\mathbf{x}_0$, edit mask $m$, target content $c$.
    *   Compute intermediate latent $\mathbf{x}(t_{edit}) = \text{ODESolve}(\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{f}_\theta, 0, t_{edit})$.
    *   Modify $\mathbf{x}(t_{edit})$ to $\mathbf{x}'(t_{edit})$ based on $m$ and $c$.
    *   Use numerical ODE solver to integrate $d\mathbf{x}/dt = -\mathbf{f}_\theta(\mathbf{x}(t), t, \mathbf{y}')$ from $t=t_{edit}$ to $t=0$, starting at $\mathbf{x}'(t_{edit})$.
    *   Output: Edited image $\hat{\mathbf{x}}'_0 = \mathbf{x}(0)$.

**(Data Collection)**
We will utilize standard high-resolution image datasets like CelebA-HQ (256x256 or 1024x1024) and LSUN Bedrooms/Churches (256x256) for general image synthesis and editing tasks. To demonstrate applicability in specific domains, we will consider publicly available medical image datasets like BraTS (MRI brain scans, for inpainting/reconstruction) or CheXpert (Chest X-rays, for potential anomaly insertion/removal simulation). Standard train/validation/test splits will be used. Corruption types will include:
*   Inpainting: Center masks, random block masks, free-form masks (using standard datasets like Parsis et al., 2020).
*   Deblurring: Gaussian blur kernels of varying sizes, motion blur kernels.
*   Denoising: Additive Gaussian noise at different levels.

**(Experimental Design and Validation)**

1.  **Baselines:** We will compare ICNOD against:
    *   Optimization-based diffusion methods: RePaint, DDNM, potentially Plug-and-Play methods.
    *   Exact/Approximate inversion diffusion methods: EDICT, ERDDCI, BDIA, Negative-prompt Inversion (where applicable for the task).
    *   Standard conditional diffusion models (e.g., DDIM sampling with classifier-free guidance adapted for inverse problems).
    *   Non-diffusion baselines relevant to specific tasks (e.g., GAN inversion methods for editing, specialized networks for deblurring/inpainting).

2.  **Tasks & Evaluation:**
    *   **Reconstruction from Corruption:**
        *   Evaluate inpainting, deblurring, and denoising performance.
        *   Metrics: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) to measure reconstruction fidelity and perceptual quality. Frechet Inception Distance (FID) might be used cautiously to assess the realism of reconstructed details if multiple samples were hypothetically possible (though our focus is deterministic).
    *   **Image Editing:**
        *   Evaluate localized edits (e.g., changing eye color on CelebA-HQ, inserting objects into scenes) and potentially text-guided edits if combined with text conditioning.
        *   Metrics: Primarily qualitative visual inspection by humans. Quantitative metrics could include CLIP Score (for text-edit alignment), Mask IoU (if editing specific objects), and potentially user studies comparing coherence and quality against baselines.
    *   **Injectivity Verification:**
        *   Empirically test the invertibility by applying the forward ODE and then the reverse ODE (unconditioned) to clean images. Measure reconstruction error (PSNR, LPIPS) – should be negligible up to numerical precision.
        *   Analyze the properties of the learned $\mathbf{f}_\theta$ (e.g., Lipschitz constants, Jacobian eigenvalues/singular values) to provide empirical evidence supporting the theoretical injectivity claims.
    *   **Scalability and Efficiency:**
        *   Test performance on higher resolutions (e.g., 256x256, potentially 512x512).
        *   Measure average inference time per image for inversion and editing tasks. Compare against the wall-clock time of iterative baseline methods. Record model size (number of parameters) and training time.

3.  **Ablation Studies:**
    *   Investigate the impact of the Lipschitz regularization term ($\lambda$) on stability, invertibility, and final performance.
    *   Compare different injective network architectures for $\mathbf{f}_\theta$.
    *   Analyze the effect of the choice of ODE solver and its tolerance on reconstruction accuracy versus speed.
    *   Evaluate the importance of conditioning $\mathbf{f}_\theta$ vs. only guiding the reverse process post-hoc.
