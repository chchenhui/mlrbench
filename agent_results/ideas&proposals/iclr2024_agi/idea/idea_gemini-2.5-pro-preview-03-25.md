**Title:** Neuro-Symbolic Architecture for Inductive Tool Synthesis in LLMs

**Motivation:** Current tool-augmented LLMs typically rely on pre-defined tool APIs. This limits their ability to handle novel situations requiring unforeseen functionalities, a crucial step towards AGI's adaptability. Enabling LLMs to *synthesize* new tools on-the-fly from basic primitives or existing tools can significantly enhance their problem-solving capabilities.

**Main Idea:** We propose a neuro-symbolic framework where an LLM interacts with a symbolic reasoning engine. The LLM analyzes a task and identifies functional gaps not covered by existing tools. It then proposes a high-level specification for a needed tool. The symbolic engine attempts to synthesize this new tool by composing existing tools or atomic functions (primitives) using inductive logic programming or program synthesis techniques. The synthesized tool (represented as code or a callable function) is then added to the LLM's toolkit for immediate use. This approach combines the LLM's contextual understanding with the symbolic engine's rigorous synthesis and verification capabilities, aiming for LLMs that can dynamically expand their own functional repertoire when faced with novel challenges.
