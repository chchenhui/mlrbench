# Neuro-Symbolic Inductive Tool Synthesis: Enabling LLMs to Create Their Own Tools

## 1. Introduction

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents a system capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across a broad range of tasks at a human or superhuman level. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language understanding, generation, and reasoning across diverse domains, they still face significant limitations when confronted with novel situations requiring unforeseen functionalities.

Current tool-augmented LLMs typically operate with pre-defined tool APIs, limiting their adaptability—a crucial feature of AGI. These models can utilize existing tools but cannot create new ones when faced with challenges that require functionalities beyond their current toolkit. This constraint represents a fundamental limitation in their problem-solving capabilities and adaptability.

This research aims to address this critical gap by developing a novel neuro-symbolic architecture that enables LLMs to synthesize new tools on-the-fly. By combining the contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the formal methods of symbolic systems, particularly inductive logic programming and program synthesis, we envision a system capable of dynamically expanding its functional repertoire when faced with novel challenges.

The significance of this research extends beyond academic interest. By enabling LLMs to create their own tools, we potentially enhance their autonomy, adaptability, and problem-solving capabilities—three key attributes of AGI. Moreover, such capability could revolutionize how AI systems are deployed in real-world applications, allowing them to adapt to new environments and requirements without human intervention. This represents a substantial step toward more versatile and robust AI systems that can serve human needs across a wider range of contexts and over longer periods without requiring constant updates or supervision.

## 2. Methodology

Our research methodology centers on developing a neuro-symbolic framework for inductive tool synthesis in LLMs. The system integrates neural components (the LLM) with symbolic reasoning engines to enable the creation of new tools from basic primitives or by composing existing tools.

### 2.1 System Architecture

The proposed architecture consists of five core components:

1. **Large Language Model**: Serves as the neural component that interfaces with users, analyzes tasks, identifies functional gaps, and generates high-level tool specifications.

2. **Tool Memory**: Stores existing tools, their functionalities, usage patterns, and relationships.

3. **Primitive Function Library**: Contains elementary operations that can be composed to create more complex tools.

4. **Symbolic Synthesis Engine**: Employs formal methods to synthesize tools from specifications using inductive logic programming and program synthesis techniques.

5. **Verification Module**: Ensures correctness, robustness, and safety of synthesized tools.

### 2.2 Tool Synthesis Process

The tool synthesis process follows a systematic flow:

#### 2.2.1 Gap Identification

The LLM analyzes the current task and identifies functional gaps through a prompted self-reflection process:

$$G = LLM(C, T, \{t_1, t_2, ..., t_n\})$$

Where:
- $G$ represents the identified functional gap
- $C$ is the current context
- $T$ is the target task
- $\{t_1, t_2, ..., t_n\}$ are existing tools

The LLM is prompted with:
```
Given the current task [task description] and available tools [list of tools], 
identify any functionality gaps that prevent completing the task efficiently. 
Describe precisely what new capability would be needed.
```

#### 2.2.2 Tool Specification Generation

The LLM generates a formal specification for the required tool:

$$S = LLM(G, C, T, \{t_1, t_2, ..., t_n\}, P)$$

Where:
- $S$ is the tool specification
- $P$ represents the primitive functions available

The specification includes:
- Input/output types and formats
- Functional requirements
- Edge cases and constraints
- Relationship to existing tools
- Suggested primitive functions or existing tools that might be helpful

#### 2.2.3 Candidate Tool Synthesis

The symbolic synthesis engine generates candidate implementations using three complementary approaches:

1. **Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)**:
   
   Given positive examples $E^+$, negative examples $E^-$, and background knowledge $B$ (including existing tools and primitives), the ILP component synthesizes a program $h$ such that:
   
   $$\forall e \in E^+: B \cup h \models e$$
   $$\forall e \in E^-: B \cup h \not\models e$$

2. **Deductive Program Synthesis**:
   
   Using the specification $S$ as a formal requirement, synthesize program $P$ such that:
   
   $$\forall i, o: S(i, o) \Rightarrow P(i) = o$$

3. **Neural-Guided Program Search**:
   
   The LLM generates initial code candidates that are refined through a guided search process:
   
   $$C = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_k\} = LLM(S)$$
   
   For each candidate $c_i$, a search is performed in the space of possible modifications to find an implementation that satisfies $S$.

The synthesis engine combines these approaches and selects the most promising candidates based on correctness, efficiency, and simplicity metrics.

#### 2.2.4 Tool Verification and Refinement

Each candidate implementation undergoes rigorous verification:

1. **Static Analysis**: Checks for type correctness, potential runtime errors, and resource usage bounds.

2. **Test Case Generation**: Automatically generates test cases targeting edge cases and normal operation:
   
   $$T = \{(i_1, o_1), (i_2, o_2), ..., (i_m, o_m)\}$$

3. **Formal Verification**: For critical tools, applies formal verification techniques to prove correctness properties.

If verification fails, feedback is provided to the synthesis engine for refinement:

$$F = \{(i_f, o_f, o_a) | (i_f, o_f) \in T, P(i_f) = o_a, o_f \neq o_a\}$$

Where $F$ contains inputs $i_f$, expected outputs $o_f$, and actual outputs $o_a$.

#### 2.2.5 Tool Integration and Usage

Once verified, the tool is integrated into the system's toolkit:

1. **Wrapper Generation**: Creates a standardized interface for the new tool.
2. **Documentation**: Generates usage documentation.
3. **Tool Registry Update**: Updates the tool memory with metadata about the new tool.

The LLM can then immediately utilize the newly synthesized tool:

$$R = LLM(C, T, \{t_1, t_2, ..., t_n, t_{new}\})$$

Where $R$ is the response to the original task, now using the expanded toolkit.

### 2.3 Data Collection

The system requires four main categories of data:

1. **Tool Specifications and Implementations**: A diverse corpus of 1,000+ existing tools with formal specifications and implementations across domains including data processing, mathematical computation, text manipulation, and API interactions.

2. **Primitive Function Library**: A comprehensive set of 100+ atomic functions serving as building blocks, categorized by domains and annotated with formal specifications.

3. **Tool Synthesis Examples**: 500+ examples of tool synthesis processes, including specifications, intermediate steps, and final implementations, serving as training data.

4. **Test Suite**: A comprehensive test suite covering diverse scenarios where tool synthesis would be beneficial, including edge cases and complex multi-step tasks.

We will collect this data through:
- Mining open-source repositories and libraries
- Curating examples from programming textbooks and tutorials
- Generating synthetic examples using existing LLMs and verification systems
- Commissioning expert programmers to create reference implementations

### 2.4 Training Process

The training process involves several stages:

1. **LLM Fine-tuning**: We will fine-tune a state-of-the-art LLM (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Claude 3) on:
   - Tool specification tasks
   - Gap identification tasks

   - Developing neural-guided search algorithms

3. **Integration Training**: The complete system will undergo integration training to optimize the interaction between neural and symbolic components through:
   - Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
   - Self-play where the system attempts to solve increasingly complex tasks
   - Curriculum learning with progressively more challenging tool synthesis tasks

2. **Functional Correctness Score (FCS)**:
   $$FCS = \frac{1}{|T|} \sum_{(i,o) \in T} \mathbf{1}(P(i) = o)$$
   Where $T$ is the test suite and $\mathbf{1}$ is the indicator function.

3. **Tool Synthesis Efficiency (TSE)**:
   $$TSE = \frac{\text{Complexity of task solved}}{\text{Time taken to synthesize tool}}$$

4. **Adaptability Index (AI)**:
   $$AI = \frac{\text{Number of unique domains where tools were successfully synthesized}}{\text{Total number of domains tested}}$$

5. **Comparative Problem-Solving Advantage (CPSA)**:
