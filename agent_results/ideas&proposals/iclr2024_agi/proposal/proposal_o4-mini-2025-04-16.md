Title  
Adaptive Neuro-Symbolic Architecture for Inductive Tool Synthesis in Large Language Models  

1. Introduction  
Background.  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that augmenting them with external “tools” (e.g., calculators, web‐APIs, database queries) dramatically extends their problem‐solving capabilities. However, existing tool‐augmented LLMs assume a fixed, pre‐defined set of tool APIs. In open‐ended environments—one of the hallmarks of artificial general intelligence (AGI)—agents frequently face novel situations requiring functionalities not covered by any pre‐registered tool. The ability to autonomously **synthesize** new tools at inference time from basic primitives (e.g., arithmetic, string manipulation) or by composing existing tools is therefore a critical step toward AGI’s adaptability and robustness.  

Research Objectives.  We propose to develop a **neuro‐symbolic** framework in which an LLM (the “neural” component) dynamically identifies functional gaps and speculates high‐level tool specifications, and a symbolic reasoning engine (the “symbolic” component) performs inductive tool synthesis by composing existing primitives or tool calls via program synthesis and inductive logic programming (ILP). Specifically, our objectives are:  
1. To design an interface by which an LLM can detect a missing capability, formulate a specification for a new tool, and invoke the synthesis engine.  
2. To develop an ILP‐based synthesis module that composes primitives and existing tools into new callable functions matching the LLM’s specification.  
3. To integrate rigorous verification and validation (via test‐case generation and type checking) to ensure the correctness and safety of synthesized tools.  
4. To empirically evaluate the framework’s ability to extend an LLM’s toolkit and improve performance on novel tasks under realistic computational constraints.  

Significance.  By enabling LLMs to extend their own toolsets on‐the‐fly, we move a step closer to AGI’s hallmark of open‐ended adaptability. Our neuro‐symbolic approach combines the LLM’s contextual understanding and natural language reasoning with the symbolic engine’s formal guarantees and compositional generalization, addressing limitations in both purely neural and purely symbolic systems.  

2. Methodology  
Our research design comprises six components: (A) Architecture Overview; (B) LLM‐Symbolic Interface; (C) Inductive Tool Synthesis Module; (D) Verification & Integration; (E) Data Collection & Benchmarks; and (F) Experimental Design & Evaluation Metrics.  

A. Architecture Overview  
We envisage a pipeline (Figure 1):  
1. **Task Input**: A natural language task is presented to the LLM.  
2. **Gap Detection**: If the LLM’s existing toolset is insufficient, it generates a **Tool Specification**.  
3. **Synthesis Engine**: A symbolic reasoning module receives the specification, plus background knowledge (tool primitives, type signatures, example I/O).  
4. **Tool Construction**: The engine synthesizes code or a function matching the spec.  
5. **Verification**: Generated code is tested against example cases and type‐checked.  
6. **Execution**: The new tool is registered and invoked by the LLM to solve the original task.  

B. LLM‐Symbolic Interface  
• Representation of Tools.  Each tool $T_i$ is defined by a signature  
$$T_i: \tau_{\mathrm{in}}\to\tau_{\mathrm{out}},$$  
where $\tau_{\mathrm{in}}$ and $\tau_{\mathrm{out}}$ are type descriptors (e.g., integer, string, list). Existing primitives (e.g., `add(x,y)`, `concat(s_1,s_2)`) form the atomic vocabulary.  
• Specification Language.  The LLM emits a high‐level spec $\mathcal{S}$ including:  
  – A natural‐language docstring.  
  – Input/output types $\tau_{\mathrm{in}},\tau_{\mathrm{out}}$.  
  – A small set of input–output example pairs $E^+=\{(x_j,y_j)\}$ and optional negative examples $E^-$.  
  – Cost or performance constraints (e.g., time/space budgets).  

C. Inductive Tool Synthesis Module  
We adopt an ILP‐inspired formulation (Muggleton et al., 2023). Let $B$ be the background knowledge (primitive tool definitions), $E^+$ the positive examples, and $E^-$ the negatives. We seek a hypothesis $H$ (a program) satisfying:  
$$B \cup H \models E^+,\quad B \cup H \not\models E^-.$$  
Concretely, we define a search over compositions of primitives and existing tools, guided by:  
1. **Neural Heuristic**: The LLM ranks candidate subexpressions by relevance.  
2. **Symbolic Pruning**: Type constraints eliminate ill‐typed programs.  
3. **Scoring Function**: We score candidate programs $p$ by  
$$\mathrm{score}(p)=\lambda_1\cdot\mathrm{accuracy}(p,E^+)-\lambda_2\cdot\mathrm{size}(p),$$  
where $\mathrm{accuracy}(p,E^+)=\frac{1}{|E^+|}\sum_{(x,y)\in E^+} \mathbf{1}[p(x)=y]$ and $\mathrm{size}(p)$ is the AST node count. $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$ are tunable.  
Algorithmic Steps:  
1. **Initial Candidate Generation**: Enumerate depth‐bounded compositions of primitives up to depth $d_{\max}$.  
2. **Neural Ranking**: Query LLM to assign a relevance score to each candidate’s docstring match.  
3. **Type Filtering**: Discard candidates violating $\tau_{\mathrm{in}}\→\tau_{\mathrm{out}}$.  
4. **Test‐Case Evaluation**: Evaluate top $k$ candidates on $E^+$.  
5. **Local Synthesis Refinement**: For near‐correct candidates, perform argument binding and constant synthesis (filling in numeric or string constants) via integer optimization or SMT solving.  
6. **Verification**: Test final candidates against withheld examples and ensure safety invariants hold (e.g., no unbounded recursion).  
If no candidate passes, increment $d_{\max}$ or request more examples from LLM.  

D. Verification & Integration  
• **Type and Resource Checking**. We embed linear resource annotations in tool signatures (e.g., cost models) and statically verify compliance using a lightweight effect system.  
• **Dynamic Fuzz Testing**. For each synthesized tool $p$, we generate random inputs within $\tau_{\mathrm{in}}$’s domain and assert invariants (e.g., idempotence, monotonicity) if specified.  
• **Runtime Sandboxing**. Tools run in a secure container to prevent side‐effects.  
• **Registration**. Upon passing verification, $p$ is added to the LLM’s tool registry and is callable via an API endpoint.  

E. Data Collection & Benchmarks  
To evaluate generalization and robustness, we will assemble three task suites:  
1. **Synthetic Function Tasks**. Automatically generate tasks requiring simple compositions (e.g., “Given a list of numbers, compute the moving average over a window of size 3”).  
2. **API Wrapping Tasks**. Real‐world scenarios where a combination of web APIs is needed (e.g., “Fetch weather in city X and compute the average over the next 5 days”). We hide direct API calls so the LLM must synthesize wrappers.  
3. **Math Word Problems**. Novel formula derivation tasks requiring custom helper functions (e.g., custom distance metrics).  

For each suite, we split into:  
– **Seen Tools**: tasks solvable with pre‐defined primitives.  
– **Unseen Tools**: tasks requiring at least one new tool.  

F. Experimental Design & Evaluation Metrics  
Baselines.  
1. **Static‐Tool LLM**: The same LLM plus only pre‐defined primitives.  
2. **Ground‐Truth Synthesis**: LLM with access to ideal (gold) synthesized code.  
3. **Neural‐Only Synthesis**: Purely LLM‐based code generation without symbolic verification.  

Metrics.  
– **Task Success Rate**: Percentage of tasks for which the final answer is correct.  
– **Synthesis Success Rate**: Fraction of unseen‐tool tasks for which a correct new tool is synthesized.  
– **Average Synthesis Time**: Wall‐clock time per new tool.  
– **Code Quality**: Measured by cyclomatic complexity and average lines of code.  
– **Runtime Performance**: Time and memory overhead of invoking synthesized tools.  

Ablations.  
– Remove neural ranking (random ranking).  
– Disable dynamic fuzz testing.  
– Limit search depth $d_{\max}$ to study scalability.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate the following outcomes:  
1. **Demonstration of Dynamic Adaptation**: Our system will handle a majority (> 80%) of unseen‐tool tasks in the synthetic suite and show substantial gains over static‐tool baselines (e.g., 40% → 75% task success).  
2. **Scalable Synthesis Engine**: By combining neural heuristics with symbolic pruning, we expect synthesis times under 5 seconds per tool for typical cases, outperforming pure ILP approaches.  
3. **Verified Tool Quality**: Synthesized tools will pass fuzz testing with > 95% reliability, demonstrating robustness and safety.  
4. **Generalization Across Domains**: The framework will successfully generalize from synthetic to real‐world API tasks and math word problems, validating cross‐domain applicability.  

Broader Impact.  Our neuro‐symbolic synthesis paradigm addresses a core limitation of current LLM‐based agents—reliance on fixed toolsets—paving the way for more autonomous, adaptive AI systems. By integrating formal verification, we enhance trustworthiness, critical for safety‐sensitive applications. This work contributes foundational methods toward AGI by equipping language agents with the capacity to self‐extend their functional repertoire, a cornerstone of open‐ended intelligence. We will release:  
– An open‐source synthesis framework and benchmarks.  
– A suite of evaluation tasks for the community.  
– Detailed ablation studies and best practices for neuro‐symbolic integration.  

In conclusion, our proposal seeks to bridge neural and symbolic AI for inductive tool synthesis in LLMs. By enabling dynamic tool creation, verification, and integration, we move closer to AI systems capable of self‐directed extension—an essential stride toward AGI.
