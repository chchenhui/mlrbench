Title: MetaCaus â€“ Causal Invariance from Domain Metadata for Robust Generalization

Motivation:  
Domain generalization remains challenging as standard ERM fails under distribution shift. Domain-level metadata (e.g., acquisition settings, environmental tags) provides untapped causal cues. Integrating this side information can reveal invariant mechanisms underlying data, enabling models to generalize reliably to unseen domains.

Main Idea:  
MetaCaus is a two-stage framework that leverages domain metadata to infer and enforce causal invariances.  
1. Causal Discovery Module: Conditioned on domain metadata, we learn domain-specific causal graphs using neural causal inference (e.g., conditional independence tests, variational autoencoders with graph priors).  
2. Invariance-Regularized Representation: We enforce alignment of latent features with the discovered causal parents of the target via an invariant risk minimization objective across domains. A domain-conditioned gating network adapts feature selection at inference.  
Methodology includes meta-learning the regularization weights for each discovered causal edge, and fine-tuning on held-out domains. Expected outcomes are consistent improvements in out-of-distribution accuracy on PACS, DomainBed, and colored MNIST. By explicitly discovering and enforcing causal invariances guided by metadata, MetaCaus offers a practical path toward robust, domain-agnostic models.
