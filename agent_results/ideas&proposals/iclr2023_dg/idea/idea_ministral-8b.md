### Title: Enhancing Domain Generalization through Multi-Modal Causal Modeling

### Motivation:
Domain generalization (DG) is crucial for real-world applications where models must generalize to unseen data distributions. Current methods often fail to consistently outperform empirical risk minimization baselines. By leveraging multi-modal data and causal modeling, we can enhance the robustness of machine learning models to distribution shifts.

### Main Idea:
This research proposes a novel approach to domain generalization by integrating multi-modal data and causal modeling. The key idea is to use causal graphs to explicitly model the relationships between different modalities and domain-specific features. By doing so, we can capture known invariances and leverage additional information to improve generalization.

**Methodology:**
1. **Data Collection:** Gather multi-modal data (e.g., images, text, sensor data) from various domains.
2. **Causal Graph Construction:** Construct causal graphs that capture the relationships between modalities and domain-specific features.
3. **Model Training:** Train a multi-modal model that incorporates the causal graph to learn robust representations.
4. **Domain Adaptation:** Use the learned representations to adapt to new domains with minimal retraining.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Improved generalization performance across different domains.
- Robust models that can handle distribution shifts effectively.
- Insights into the importance of causal relationships and multi-modal data for domain generalization.

**Potential Impact:**
This research can significantly enhance the reliability and robustness of machine learning models in real-world applications, leading to better performance in domains where data distribution shifts are common. Additionally, it provides a framework for incorporating domain-level meta-data and known invariances, offering a practical approach to domain generalization.
