# Domain-adaptive Attention for Multi-modal Invariant Feature Learning

## Motivation
Domain generalization (DG) remains challenging because models trained on one distribution often fail when deployed in different environments. Current approaches struggle to outperform standard empirical risk minimization, suggesting that additional information is crucial for robust generalization. Multi-modal data offers a promising avenue, as different modalities may capture complementary invariant features that persist across domain shifts. However, effectively leveraging multi-modal information to identify and preserve these invariances remains an open problem.

## Main Idea
I propose a domain-adaptive attention mechanism that dynamically weighs feature contributions from different modalities to extract domain-invariant representations. The approach uses a meta-learning framework where domain-specific attention weights are learned during training, allowing the model to identify which modality provides the most generalizable features for each component of the representation. By incorporating domain-level metadata as conditioning signals, the attention mechanism can adapt its weighting strategy based on detected domain characteristics. This approach introduces an adversarial component that explicitly penalizes domain-specific features while promoting features that remain consistent across domains. The system maintains a shared invariant feature space while allowing modality-specific pathways to extract complementary information. Empirical evaluations would measure both in-domain and cross-domain performance across multiple modalities, with ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each modality to the invariant representation.
