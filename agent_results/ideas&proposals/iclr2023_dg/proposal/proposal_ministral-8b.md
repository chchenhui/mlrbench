# Title: Causal Structure-Aware Domain Generalization via Invariant Mechanism Learning

## Introduction

The challenge of domain generalization (DG) is to build machine learning models that perform reliably across diverse and unseen domains. Existing DG methods often fail to consistently outperform standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) baselines due to their reliance on spurious correlations that vary across domains. This research aims to address this issue by leveraging causal structures to extract domain-invariant causal features, thereby enhancing the robustness of models to distribution shifts.

### Background

Domain generalization is a critical problem in machine learning, especially in applications where data from different domains is encountered during deployment. Traditional DG methods often struggle with distribution shifts, where the test data distribution differs significantly from the training data distribution. This is particularly problematic in real-world applications, such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and natural language processing, where the training data may not cover all possible scenarios encountered during deployment.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to propose a framework that integrates causal discovery with representation learning to extract domain-invariant causal features. Specifically, the research aims to:

1. Infer a causal graph that distinguishes stable causal relationships from spurious associations using domain-level metadata and multi-domain data.
2. Enforce invariance by aligning representations with the inferred causal structure through constraint-based optimization, penalizing dependencies on non-causal factors.
3. Validate the proposed method on benchmarks like DomainBed and compare its performance against ERM and state-of-the-art DG methods.

### Significance

This research is significant because it addresses the core challenge of identifying stable features that generalize under distribution shifts. By leveraging causal structures, the proposed framework can disentangle invariant mechanisms from domain-specific biases, leading to more robust and reliable models. This approach has the potential to enable reliable models for settings where domains are diverse or unobserved during training, such as medical imaging or autonomous driving.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed framework consists of two main components: causal graph inference and invariant mechanism learning. The methodology is detailed as follows:

#### Causal Graph Inference

1. **Data Collection**: Collect multi-domain data with domain-level metadata (e.g., environment labels) to infer a causal graph.
2. **Causal Graph Learning**: Use algorithms such as conditional independence tests to infer a causal graph that distinguishes stable causal relationships from spurious associations.
   - **Algorithm**: Use the PC algorithm (Peter and Clark algorithm) to infer causal graphs from observational data.
   - **Mathematical Formulation**:
     $$
     \text{PC}(X) = \arg\min_{\text{graph } G} \sum_{i \in X} I(\text{parents}(i) \neq \emptyset) + \sum_{i \in X} \text{ICP}(\text{parents}(i))
     $$
     where $\text{ICP}(\text{parents}(i))$ is the Information Criterion for Parents (ICP) score.
3. **Validation**: Validate the inferred causal graph using techniques such as stability selection and cross-validation.

#### Invariant Mechanism Learning

1. **Representation Learning**: Learn representations of the data using a neural network.
   - **Algorithm**: Use a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image data or a recurrent neural network (RNN) for sequential data.
   - **Mathematical Formulation**:
     $$
     \mathbf{h}_i = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_1 \mathbf{x}_i + \mathbf{b}_1)
     $$
     where $\mathbf{h}_i$ is the hidden representation, $\mathbf{x}_i$ is the input, $\mathbf{W}_1$ and $\mathbf{b}_1$ are the network parameters, and $\sigma$ is the activation function.
2. **Constraint-Based Optimization**: Enforce invariance by aligning representations with the inferred causal structure.
   - **Algorithm**: Use differentiable regularization to penalize dependencies on non-causal factors.
   - **Mathematical Formulation**:
     $$
     \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{classification}} + \lambda \sum_{i \in \text{non-causal factors}} \text{Dependency Penalty}(\mathbf{h}_i)
     $$
     where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{classification}}$ is the classification loss, $\lambda$ is the regularization strength, and $\text{Dependency Penalty}(\mathbf{h}_i)$ measures the dependency of the representation $\mathbf{h}_i$ on non-causal factors.
3. **Validation**: Validate the invariant mechanism learning method using benchmarks like DomainBed and compare it against ERM and state-of-the-art DG methods.

### Experimental Design

1. **Datasets**: Use benchmarks like DomainBed, which contains multiple domains with varying data distributions.
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Use metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.
3. **Baselines**: Compare the proposed method against ERM and state-of-the-art DG methods such as Domain Adaptation via Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA) and Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML).

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Improved Robustness**: The proposed framework is expected to improve the robustness of models to distribution shifts caused by spurious correlations.
2. **Domain-Invariant Features**: The framework will extract domain-invariant causal features that generalize across diverse domains.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: The comparative analysis with ERM and state-of-the-art DG methods will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Impact

The impact of this research lies in enabling reliable models for settings where domains are diverse or unobserved during training. The proposed framework can be applied to various domains, such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and natural language processing, where domain generalization is crucial. By leveraging causal structures, the framework addresses the core challenge of identifying stable features that generalize under distribution shifts, leading to more robust and reliable models.

This research has the potential to advance the field of domain generalization by providing a novel approach that combines causal discovery with representation learning. The proposed framework can serve as a foundation for future research in this area, leading to more robust and reliable machine learning models.
