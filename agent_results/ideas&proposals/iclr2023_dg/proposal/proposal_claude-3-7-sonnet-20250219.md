# Causal Structure-Aware Representation Learning for Robust Domain Generalization

## 1. Introduction

Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes real-world environments where distribution shifts between training and testing conditions are inevitable. The field of domain generalization (DG) addresses this challenge by developing models that can generalize well to unseen domains without requiring adaptation data. Despite significant research efforts, existing general-purpose DG approaches have struggled to consistently outperform standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) baselines across diverse benchmarks (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021).

This research is motivated by a fundamental observation: current DG methods often fail because they rely on spurious correlations that vary across domains rather than capturing the underlying causal mechanisms that remain invariant. The ability to identify stable features that generalize under distribution shifts represents a core challenge in achieving robust domain generalization. Causal mechanisms, which dictate data-generating processes, offer a promising direction as they are inherently invariant across domains when the underlying causal structure remains constant.

Recent work in causality-inspired representation learning has shown promise in improving generalization (Lv et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021), but existing approaches often lack the ability to explicitly model and leverage the full causal structure underlying the data generation process. Additionally, most current methods do not effectively utilize available domain-level metadata that could provide crucial information about the causal factors at play.

Our research objectives are threefold:
1. Develop a framework that integrates causal discovery with representation learning to extract domain-invariant causal features from multi-domain data
2. Leverage domain-level metadata to enhance causal structure identification and invariant mechanism learning
3. Design a learning algorithm that encourages representations to align with the inferred causal structure while penalizing dependencies on non-causal factors

The significance of this research lies in its potential to fundamentally advance domain generalization by grounding representation learning in causal principles. By explicitly modeling the causal structure and focusing on invariant mechanisms, our approach promises to yield models that are inherently robust to distribution shifts. This has profound implications for applications in critical domains such as healthcare, autonomous systems, and environmental monitoring, where distribution shifts are common and reliable performance is essential.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed methodology, Causal Structure-Aware Representation Learning (CSARL), integrates causal discovery with representation learning to identify and leverage invariant causal mechanisms across domains. The framework consists of three main components: (1) causal structure discovery from multi-domain data, (2) invariant mechanism learning through representation alignment, and (3) a novel regularization approach that enforces adherence to the discovered causal structure.

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

Let $\mathcal{D} = \{D_1, D_2, ..., D_S\}$ represent a set of $S$ source domains, where each domain $D_s$ consists of data pairs $(x_s^i, y_s^i)$ for $i = 1, 2, ..., n_s$. Here, $x_s^i \in \mathcal{X}$ represents input features and $y_s^i \in \mathcal{Y}$ denotes the corresponding labels. Additionally, we have access to domain-level metadata $M_s$ for each source domain $D_s$, which provides contextual information about the domain (e.g., acquisition conditions, environmental factors).

The goal of domain generalization is to learn a model $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ that performs well on a target domain $D_T$ with data distribution different from the source domains, without accessing any target domain data during training.

We assume that there exists an underlying causal structure $\mathcal{G}$ that governs the data generation process across all domains. This structure includes both observed variables (features $X$ and labels $Y$) and potential unobserved variables (latent confounders $Z$). While the causal mechanisms (i.e., the functional relationships between variables) remain invariant, the distribution of certain variables may change across domains, leading to domain shift.

### 2.2 Causal Structure Discovery from Multi-Domain Data

The first step in our approach is to infer the causal graph $\mathcal{G}$ that captures the relationships between variables across domains. We propose a two-stage approach:

#### 2.2.1 Initial Causal Graph Estimation

We employ a constraint-based causal discovery algorithm adapted for multi-domain data. Specifically, we extend the PC algorithm (Spirtes et al., 2000) to incorporate domain-level constraints:

1. Construct a complete undirected graph over all observed variables (features and labels)
2. For each pair of variables $(X_i, X_j)$, test conditional independence given different conditioning sets $\mathbf{S}$:
   - $X_i \perp\!\!\!\perp X_j | \mathbf{S}$
   - If independence holds, remove the edge between $X_i$ and $X_j$
3. Orient edges based on v-structures and propagate orientations

To adapt this for multi-domain data, we leverage the domain index $s$ as an additional variable that can help identify domain-specific variations:

$$P(X_i | X_j, \mathbf{S}, s) \neq P(X_i | X_j, \mathbf{S}, s') \Rightarrow \text{domain-dependent relationship}$$

Additionally, we incorporate domain metadata $M_s$ to inform the causal discovery process:

$$\mathcal{G} = \text{CausalDiscovery}(\{D_s\}_{s=1}^S, \{M_s\}_{s=1}^S)$$

The resulting causal graph $\mathcal{G}$ differentiates between:
- Invariant causal edges (present with consistent orientation across domains)
- Domain-specific edges (present or having different strengths across domains)
- Spurious correlations (edges induced by domain-specific confounders)

#### 2.2.2 Refinement via Domain-Informed Invariance Testing

To refine the initial causal graph, we employ an invariance testing procedure that leverages the multi-domain data:

For each potential causal relationship $X_i \rightarrow Y$ in the graph:

1. Fit a conditional model $\hat{P}(Y | X_i, \mathbf{PA}_Y \setminus \{X_i\})$ where $\mathbf{PA}_Y$ are the parents of $Y$ in the current graph
2. Test if the conditional distribution is invariant across domains:
   $$H_0: P(Y | X_i, \mathbf{PA}_Y \setminus \{X_i\}, s=1) = \ldots = P(Y | X_i, \mathbf{PA}_Y \setminus \{X_i\}, s=S)$$
3. If invariance holds, retain the edge as a causal relationship; otherwise, mark it as a domain-specific relationship

The refined causal graph $\mathcal{G}^*$ contains edges labeled as either invariant causal relationships or domain-specific relationships.

### 2.3 Invariant Mechanism Learning through Representation Alignment

Based on the inferred causal graph $\mathcal{G}^*$, we design a neural network architecture and training procedure that enforces alignment with the causal structure.

#### 2.3.1 Causal Feature Extraction Network

We design an encoder $E_{\theta}: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Z}$ that maps input features to a latent representation space $\mathcal{Z}$, decomposed into causal and non-causal components:

$$E_{\theta}(x) = [z_c, z_{nc}]$$

where $z_c$ represents causal features corresponding to variables in the causal graph that have invariant relationships with the label $Y$, and $z_{nc}$ captures remaining features.

The classifier $F_{\phi}: \mathcal{Z} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ maps latent representations to predictions:

$$\hat{y} = F_{\phi}(E_{\theta}(x)) = F_{\phi}([z_c, z_{nc}])$$

#### 2.3.2 Causal Structure-Guided Training

We formulate a training objective that encourages the learned representations to adhere to the inferred causal structure:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}} + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{inv}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{disentangle}}$$

where:

1. $\mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}}$ is the standard prediction loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification):
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}|} \sum_{s=1}^S \sum_{i=1}^{n_s} L(F_{\phi}(E_{\theta}(x_s^i)), y_s^i)$$

2. $\mathcal{L}_{\text{inv}}$ is an invariance penalty that enforces consistent predictions across domains for samples with similar causal features:
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{inv}} = \sum_{s \neq s'} \mathbb{E}_{x_s, x_{s'}} \left[ D_{\text{KL}}(F_{\phi}(z_c^s) \| F_{\phi}(z_c^{s'})) \right]$$
   where $z_c^s$ and $z_c^{s'}$ are causal features from different domains with similar values.

3. $\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}$ is a structural consistency loss that encourages the latent space to respect the conditional independence relationships in the causal graph:
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}} = \sum_{(X_i, X_j, \mathbf{S}) \in \mathcal{I}} \text{MI}(z_i, z_j | z_{\mathbf{S}})$$
   where $\mathcal{I}$ is the set of conditional independence relationships in $\mathcal{G}^*$, and $\text{MI}$ denotes mutual information.

4. $\mathcal{L}_{\text{disentangle}}$ is a disentanglement loss that encourages independence between causal and non-causal features:
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{disentangle}} = \text{MI}(z_c, z_{nc})$$

### 2.4 Causal Regularization via Adversarial Training

To further ensure that the learned representations capture invariant causal mechanisms while being robust to domain-specific variations, we employ adversarial training:

1. Train a domain classifier $D_{\psi}: \mathcal{Z}_c \rightarrow \{1, 2, ..., S\}$ to predict the domain label from causal features $z_c$
2. Update the encoder $E_{\theta}$ to maximize the domain classifier's loss, ensuring that causal features are domain-invariant:
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}} = -\mathbb{E}_{x, s} \left[ \log D_{\psi}(z_c^s) \right]$$

The complete adversarial training objective becomes:

$$\min_{\theta, \phi} \max_{\psi} \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} + \lambda_4 \mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}}$$
