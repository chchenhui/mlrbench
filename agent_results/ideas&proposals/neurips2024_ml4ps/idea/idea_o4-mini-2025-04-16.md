Title: PhysBridge – A Hybrid Foundation Model with Physical Inductive Biases

Motivation:  
Large-scale foundation models excel at pattern recognition but often ignore domain-specific constraints, leading to unphysical or non-generalizable results in the physical sciences. Bridging data-driven pretraining with physics-informed inductive biases promises more accurate, interpretable, and robust models for tasks ranging from materials discovery to cosmological inference.

Main Idea:  
We propose PhysBridge, a multi-modal transformer architecture pre-trained on heterogeneous simulation and experimental datasets (e.g., molecular dynamics, fluid flows, telescope surveys). Key components:  
1. Equivariant Attention Layers – Enforce spatial and gauge symmetries (E(n)-equivariance) so predictions respect conservation laws.  
2. Physics-Guided Pretraining – Incorporate surrogate-physics losses (energy, momentum conservation) alongside standard language-model objectives.  
3. Adapter Modules for Fine-Tuning – Lightweight domain adapters inject task-specific operators (e.g., graph convolutions for molecular graphs, Fourier layers for turbulence) without retraining the full model.  
4. Uncertainty Quantification – Combine deep ensembles with conformal prediction to deliver calibrated error bars.  

Expected Outcomes: PhysBridge yields physically consistent predictions, superior cross-domain transfer, and accelerated workflows in materials design, fluid dynamics forecasting, and cosmological parameter estimation.
