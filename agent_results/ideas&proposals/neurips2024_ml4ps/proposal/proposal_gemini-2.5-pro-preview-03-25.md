---

## **2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**

The intersection of machine learning (ML) and the physical sciences (PS) presents transformative opportunities for accelerating scientific discovery, enhancing simulations, and extracting insights from complex datasets (ML for PS Workshop Scope). Fields such as physics, chemistry, climate science, and materials science are increasingly leveraging ML techniques. However, the direct application of standard ML methods often faces significant hurdles unique to scientific domains. Key challenges include the scarcity of labeled data for supervised training, the critical requirement for models to adhere to fundamental physical laws, and the need for interpretability beyond simple prediction accuracy (Jia et al., 2020; Chen & Lee, 2023; Key Challenges from Lit Review).

Simultaneously, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in mainstream ML, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing. SSL methods learn rich data representations from vast amounts of *unlabeled* data by solving auxiliary "pretext" tasks, significantly reducing the reliance on manual annotation (Johnson & Williams, 2024). While promising for leveraging large unlabeled scientific datasets (e.g., from simulations or observational instruments), standard SSL approaches are typically domain-agnostic and do not inherently incorporate the physical principles governing the systems under study. This oversight can lead to models that, despite performing well on surrogate tasks, produce physically implausible predictions or fail to generalize effectively under conditions constrained by physical laws.

Recent efforts have focused on integrating physics into ML. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed differential equations directly into the loss function, primarily for solving PDEs (PINNs Summary, 2025). Physics-Guided Neural Networks (PGNNs) and related methods aim to incorporate physical constraints or knowledge into model architectures or training processes, often in supervised settings (Jia et al., 2020; Doe & Smith, 2023). While valuable, these approaches often require explicit knowledge of governing equations in a differentiable form and may struggle with complex systems, noisy data, or scenarios where only partial physical knowledge is available (Tenachi et al., 2023). Furthermore, methods like Physics-Guided Foundation Models (PGFM) show promise but often rely on pre-training on extensive simulated data covering many scenarios (Yu et al., 2025), which might not always be feasible or capture the full complexity of real-world phenomena.

There is a compelling need for a framework that synergizes the data-efficiency of SSL with the principled rigour of physics-based modeling. This research proposes **Physics-Guided Self-Supervised Learning (PG-SSL)**, a novel framework designed to pretrain deep learning models on unlabeled scientific data while explicitly incorporating physical inductive biases. PG-SSL aims to learn representations that are not only predictive but also physically consistent, bridging the gap highlighted in the workshop's focus area between purely data-driven approaches (like standard foundation models) and methods relying heavily on inductive biases (like traditional physics-based models). By embedding physical laws, invariances, and symmetries as soft constraints during SSL pretraining, we hypothesize that PG-SSL will produce models that are significantly more data-efficient for downstream scientific tasks, generalize better, and yield more trustworthy, physically plausible results. This aligns strongly with the workshop's goals of fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and developing ML techniques tailored for the unique challenges of the physical sciences.

**2.2 Research Objectives**

The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop the PG-SSL Framework:** Formalize and implement a general framework for Physics-Guided Self-Supervised Learning that integrates physical constraints into various SSL strategies (e.g., contrastive, predictive).
2.  **Design Novel Physics-Aware Pretext Tasks:** Create and evaluate innovative pretext tasks specifically designed for scientific data, where the model must make predictions consistent with known physical principles (e.g., conservation laws, symmetry constraints, dynamic evolution).
3.  **Implement Differentiable Physics Modules:** Develop reusable software modules that encode physical laws (e.g., conservation of mass, momentum, energy; constraints from governing equations) in a differentiable manner, allowing them to be incorporated as loss terms during pretraining.
4.  **Evaluate PG-SSL Effectiveness:** Empirically demonstrate the benefits of PG-SSL across multiple scientific domains (e.g., fluid dynamics, climate modeling, materials science) by comparing its performance against baseline methods (standard supervised learning, standard SSL, purely physics-informed models) on downstream tasks. Key evaluation criteria include data efficiency (performance with limited labeled data), physical consistency of predictions, and generalization capabilities.
5.  **Analyze Learned Representations:** Investigate the properties of representations learned via PG-SSL to understand how physical biases shape the latent space and contribute to improved performance and interpretability.

**2.3 Significance**

This research holds significant potential impact for both the machine learning and physical science communities:

*   **Addressing Key Scientific ML Challenges:** PG-SSL directly tackles the critical issues of limited labeled data and the need for physical consistency in scientific ML applications (Key Challenges from Lit Review).
*   **Advancing Self-Supervised Learning:** It extends the applicability of SSL to complex scientific domains by providing a principled mechanism for incorporating domain knowledge, potentially inspiring similar physics-aware or domain-aware SSL approaches in other fields.
*   **Enabling Robust Scientific Discovery:** By producing more data-efficient and physically reliable models, PG-SSL can accelerate scientific discovery, improve the fidelity of surrogate models used in simulations, and enable more effective analysis of large-scale scientific datasets.
*   **Bridging Data-Driven and Physics-Informed Methods:** This work contributes directly to the central theme of the workshop by offering a practical framework that synergizes the strengths of large data models with the constraints imposed by physical laws, potentially leading to a new class of "scientific foundation models" (Yu et al., 2025).
*   **Improving Model Trustworthiness and Interpretability:** Models trained with PG-SSL are expected to produce more physically plausible outputs, enhancing trust. Analysis of the learned representations may also offer insights into how the model leverages physical principles, contributing to interpretability (White & Green, 2025).
*   **Interdisciplinary Advancement:** This research inherently fosters collaboration between ML and PS researchers, addressing problems that require expertise from both fields, aligning with the workshop's core mission.

## **3. Methodology**

**3.1 Conceptual Framework**

The PG-SSL framework operates in a two-stage process: pretraining and fine-tuning.

1.  **Pretraining Stage:** A deep learning model (e.g., a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for grid-based data, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for particle or molecular data, or a Transformer for sequential or spatio-temporal data) is trained on a large corpus of *unlabeled* scientific data. The training objective combines a standard SSL loss with a novel physics-consistency loss term.
2.  **Fine-tuning Stage:** The pretrained model backbone is then fine-tuned on a smaller *labeled* dataset for a specific downstream scientific task (e.g., property prediction, forecasting, classification).

The core innovation lies in the pretraining objective, which guides the model to learn representations that respect physical laws relevant to the data-generating process.

**3.2 Algorithmic Steps and Mathematical Formulation**

Let $X = \{x_i\}$ be a large dataset of unlabeled scientific data samples. Let $f_\theta$ be a neural network backbone (encoder) parameterized by $\theta$, which maps an input sample $x$ to a representation $z = f_\theta(x)$. Let $h_\phi$ be a projection head (often used in contrastive SSL) or prediction head (used in predictive SSL), parameterized by $\phi$.

**(a) Standard Self-Supervised Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{SSL}$):**
We can leverage existing SSL strategies. For instance:
*   **Contrastive Learning (e.g., SimCLR-style):** Generate two augmented views ($x_i'$, $x_i''$) of a sample $x_i$. The goal is to maximize agreement between representations of the same sample ($z_i' = h_\phi(f_\theta(x_i'))$, $z_i'' = h_\phi(f_\theta(x_i''))$) while minimizing agreement with representations of different samples ($z_j'$, $z_j''$ for $j \neq i$). A common loss is InfoNCE:
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{SSL}^{contrastive} = - \sum_i \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i', z_i'')/\tau)}{\sum_{j \neq i} \exp(\text{sim}(z_i', z_j')/\tau) + \exp(\text{sim}(z_i', z_i'')/\tau)} $$
    where $\text{sim}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a similarity measure (e.g., cosine similarity) and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.
*   **Predictive Learning (e.g., Masked AutoEncoding style):** Mask a portion of the input $x_i$ to get $x_i^{masked}$ and train the model to reconstruct the masked portion $\hat{x}_i^{masked}$ from the encoded representation $z_i = f_\theta(x_i^{masked})$. The loss is typically a reconstruction error:
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{SSL}^{predictive} = || \hat{x}_i^{masked} - x_i^{masked} ||^p $$
    where $p$ is typically 1 or 2.

**(b) Physics-Aware Pretext Tasks and Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{Phys}$):**
This is the key component of PG-SSL. We introduce pretext tasks and loss terms that enforce physical consistency. The specific form depends on the domain and available physical knowledge. Examples include:

*   **Conservation Laws:** For spatio-temporal data (e.g., fluid dynamics, climate), design tasks where the model predicts a future state $\hat{x}_{t+1}$ from $x_t$. The physics loss penalizes violations of conservation laws (e.g., mass, momentum, energy) in the prediction $\hat{x}_{t+1}$. Let $\mathcal{C}(\cdot)$ be a differentiable function that quantifies the violation of a conservation law (e.g., divergence of velocity field for mass conservation in incompressible flow, total energy difference).
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{Phys}^{conserv} = || \mathcal{C}(\hat{x}_{t+1}) ||^2 $$
    This requires implementing $\mathcal{C}$ using numerical methods (e.g., finite differences, finite volumes) compatible with automatic differentiation.

*   **Governing Equation Residuals (PINN-like constraint):** For systems governed by known PDEs or ODEs, $\mathcal{N}(x) = 0$, the physics loss can penalize the residual of these equations when applied to the model's output or internal representations. For instance, if the model predicts a field $u(t, \mathbf{s})$, the loss might be:
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{Phys}^{PDE} = || \mathcal{N}(f_\theta(x)) ||^2 $$
    evaluated over the domain, potentially using automatic differentiation to compute derivatives within $\mathcal{N}$. Unlike standard PINNs, this is applied during *pretraining* on unlabeled data, possibly on internal representations or auxiliary predictions, not necessarily directly solving the PDE as the primary goal.

*   **Symmetry Enforcement:** If the physical system possesses known symmetries (e.g., rotational, translational invariance), the pretext task could involve predicting transformations of the input, with a loss term enforcing that the model's output reflects the expected symmetry. Let $T$ be a symmetry transformation operator. We might enforce $f_\theta(T(x)) \approx T'(f_\theta(x))$ for some corresponding transformation $T'$ in the representation space, or enforce that a predicted property $p(x)$ satisfies $p(T(x)) = p(x)$ if it should be invariant.
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{Phys}^{symmetry} = || p(T(x)) - p(x) ||^2 $$

*   **Physical Quantity Prediction:** Augment SSL with a task to predict auxiliary physical quantities $y_{phys}$ derivable from the input $x$ (even without ground truth labels for $y_{phys}$, constraints can apply). For example, predict kinetic energy fields from velocity fields and enforce relationships between them.

**(c) Differentiable Physics Modules:**
These modules implement the functions like $\mathcal{C}(\cdot)$ or $\mathcal{N}(\cdot)$ used in $\mathcal{L}_{Phys}$. They will leverage libraries supporting automatic differentiation (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX) and numerical methods (discretization schemes). For example, a divergence operator for mass conservation in 2D on a grid can be implemented using finite differences:
$$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} \approx \frac{u_{i+1,j} - u_{i-1,j}}{2 \Delta s_1} + \frac{v_{i,j+1} - v_{i,j-1}}{2 \Delta s_2} $$
where $(u, v)$ are velocity components predicted by the model at grid point $(i, j)$, and $\Delta s_1, \Delta s_2$ are grid spacings. The module computes this quantity across the domain, allowing the loss $\mathcal{L}_{Phys}^{conserv} = || \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} ||^2$ to be backpropagated.

**(d) Combined PG-SSL Loss Function:**
The total loss for pretraining is a weighted sum of the standard SSL loss and the physics-consistency loss:
$$ \mathcal{L}_{PG-SSL} = \mathcal{L}_{SSL} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{Phys} $$
where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter balancing the contribution of the data-driven SSL objective and the physics-based constraints. The optimal value of $\lambda$ may depend on the specific task, data quality, and the reliability of the physical constraints, and will be determined through validation.

**3.3 Data Collection and Generation**

We will utilize publicly available large-scale scientific datasets, focusing on unlabeled data suitable for pretraining. Potential candidates include:
*   **Fluid Dynamics:** Datasets of simulated turbulent flows (e.g., Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database), computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation outputs for various geometries.
*   **Climate Science:** Climate model output data (e.g., CMIP6 archives), satellite observational data (e.g., sea surface temperature, atmospheric pressure fields).
*   **Materials Science:** Large structural databases (e.g., Materials Project, OQMD) containing material structures (unlabeled for many properties). Data from molecular dynamics simulations.

For fine-tuning and evaluation, we will use established benchmark datasets within these domains that contain labeled data for specific downstream tasks (e.g., predicting drag/lift coefficients in fluids, forecasting El Niño index in climate science, predicting formation energy or band gap in materials science). We will specifically target scenarios where labeled data is scarce (few-shot learning regimes).

**3.4 Experimental Design**

1.  **Baseline Models:** We will compare PG-SSL against:
    *   **Supervised Baseline:** A model trained from scratch only on the available labeled data for the downstream task.
    *   **Standard SSL Baseline:** The same model architecture pretrained using a standard SSL method (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo, MAE) on the same unlabeled data, then fine-tuned on the labeled data.
    *   **Physics-Informed Supervised Baseline:** A model trained from scratch on labeled data, but incorporating the physics loss $\mathcal{L}_{Phys}$ during supervised training.
    *   **Existing Physics-Guided SSL (if applicable):** Compare against methods like DSSL (Fu et al., 2024) if benchmark tasks align, particularly in materials science.

2.  **Downstream Tasks:** We will select 2-3 representative tasks per domain:
    *   *Fluid Dynamics:* Future state prediction (forecasting), parameter estimation (e.g., Reynolds number classification).
    *   *Climate Science:* Climate variable forecasting (e.g., temperature anomalies), extreme event detection.
    *   *Materials Science:* Prediction of electronic properties (e.g., band gap) or mechanical properties (e.g., bulk modulus) from structure.

3.  **Evaluation Scenarios:**
    *   **Few-Shot Learning:** Evaluate downstream task performance when fine-tuning with varying amounts of labeled data (e.g., 1%, 5%, 10%, 50%, 100% of the available labeled set).
    *   **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization:** Evaluate model performance on test datasets with slightly different physical parameters or conditions than those predominantly seen during pretraining/fine-tuning.
    *   **Physical Consistency Evaluation:** Assess the physical plausibility of model predictions, especially for forecasting or generation tasks.

4.  **Ablation Studies:** Systematically remove or modify components of PG-SSL (e.g., vary $\lambda$, test different $\mathcal{L}_{SSL}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{Phys}$ combinations) to understand the contribution of each part.

**3.5 Evaluation Metrics**

We will use a combination of metrics:

*   **Downstream Task Performance:** Standard metrics relevant to the task (e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for regression; Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) for classification).
*   **Physical Consistency Metrics:** Quantify adherence to physical laws. Examples:
    *   Average magnitude of the PDE residual ($||\mathcal{N}(\hat{y})||$) over the test set.
    *   Conservation error: Measure the change in conserved quantities (e.g., total mass, energy) over time in predicted sequences. Compare against ground truth physics or analytical expectations.
    *   Percentage of predictions satisfying known physical bounds or constraints.
*   **Data Efficiency:** Performance curves plotting downstream task metrics against the number/percentage of labeled examples used for fine-tuning.
*   **Representation Quality:** Use techniques like linear probing (training a linear classifier on frozen representations), t-SNE/UMAP visualizations, and Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA) to compare representations learned by different methods.
