# Physics-Guided Self-Supervised Learning: Integrating Physical Inductive Biases for Enhanced Scientific Discovery and Prediction  

## Introduction  

The integration of machine learning (ML) into physical sciences has unlocked transformative possibilities for scientific discovery, yet it faces critical challenges. Many domains in physics, materials science, climate modeling, and environmental science suffer from data scarcity, where labeled datasets are either extremely limited or costly to curate. Simultaneously, black-box ML models often fail to produce physically consistent predictions, thereby reducing their reliability for applications requiring rigorous validation. While self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like computer vision and natural language processing by leveraging unlabeled data, its adoption in the physical sciences remains hindered by the absence of physics-aware inductive biases. Conventional SSL frameworks excel at learning general-purpose representations but lack mechanisms to incorporate fundamental principles such as conservation laws, symmetry constraints, and dynamical invariances.  

Recent advancements highlight the potential of physics-informed approaches to bridge this gap. Studies have demonstrated that embedding physical knowledge into ML models improves both accuracy and interpretability. For instance, Physics-Guided Recurrent Neural Networks (PGRNNs) enhance temperature profile predictions by integrating domain-specific differential equations, while dual self-supervised learning frameworks show improved performance in material property prediction by leveraging structural physics. Additionally, foundation models pre-trained on simulated data and fine-tuned with real observations—such as the Physics-Guided Foundation Model (PGFM)—demonstrate the viability of combining deep learning with physical constraints to achieve scalable, robust predictions. However, these efforts remain fragmented, focusing on specific architectures or domains. A unified framework that systematically incorporates physical inductive biases into SSL pretraining remains absent.  

We propose Physics-Guided Self-Supervised Learning (PG-SSL), a generalizable framework that integrates domain-specific physical laws into the SSL pretraining pipeline. This approach introduces physics-aware pretext tasks that enforce compliance with conservation laws (e.g., energy, mass), symmetry constraints, and dynamical principles during self-supervised representation learning. Our methodology departs from conventional SSL by embedding differentiable physics modules into neural networks, enabling models to learn representations that inherently respect physical consistency. The core innovation lies in formulating novel pretext tasks where the model must predict physical quantities while ensuring adherence to known equations. For example, in fluid dynamics, the framework would enforce mass and momentum conservation during state prediction.  

This research holds significant potential to reshape scientific ML workflows. By reducing the dependency on labeled data while guaranteeing physically plausible outputs, PG-SSL could accelerate discovery in data-limited fields such as climate modeling, particle physics, and materials science. Furthermore, the framework aligns with the workshop’s focus on hybrid ML methods that balance data-driven flexibility with physical interpretability. Our approach directly addresses the critical need for robust, scalable models that maintain scientific rigor while leveraging the predictive power of deep learning.

## Methodology  

### Physics-Aware Self-Supervised Learning Framework  

The PG-SSL framework consists of three core components: physics-aware pretext tasks, differentiable physics-based soft constraints, and model architecture tailored for scientific domains.  

**1. Physics-Aware Pretext Tasks:**  
We design novel pretext tasks that encode physical laws into self-supervised learning. For example, in dynamical systems governed by conservation laws (mass, energy, momentum), the pretext tasks involve predicting future states while minimizing violations of these principles:  
$$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{physical}} = \sum_{i=1}^T \lambda_i \cdot \|\nabla \cdot \vec{v}_i - S_i\|^2, $$  
where $ \vec{v}_i $ is the velocity field at time $ i $, $ \nabla \cdot \vec{v}_i $ enforces mass conservation, $ S_i $ represents source terms, and $ \lambda_i $ are adaptive weights. These tasks ensure that intermediate representations naturally respect physical invariances.  

**2. Differentiable Physics Modules:**  
We incorporate differentiable physics solvers as soft constraints during pretraining. For instance, Hamiltonian neural networks model energy dynamics by embedding Hamilton’s equations:  
$$ \frac{d q_i}{dt} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial p_i}, \quad \frac{d p_i}{dt} = -\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial q_i}, $$  
where $ q_i, p_i $ are generalized coordinates and momenta, and $ \mathcal{H} $ is the Hamiltonian. By backpropagating through these equations, models learn representations that conserve energy in autonomous systems. Similar approaches are used for Lagrangian mechanics and Maxwell’s equations.  

**3. Model Architecture:**  
We adapt graph neural networks (GNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) with physics-informed layers. GNNs capture spatial dependencies in materials science problems via message-passing schemes derived from Newtonian mechanics. ViTs are modified to enforce translational invariance and rotational symmetry for climate modeling tasks.  

### Experimental Design  

**Data Collection:**  
We pretrain PG-SSL on large-scale simulated datasets from physical simulators such as Fluent for fluid dynamics, Quantum Espresso for electronic structure calculations, and GEOS-5 for climate data.  

**Baselines & Evaluation Tasks:**  
We benchmark against: (1) vanilla SSL (MoCo, SimCLR), (2) physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and (3) hybrid methods (PGFM). Tasks include:  
- *Material Property Prediction:* Predicting $ \Delta \epsilon $ (dielectric constant) from atomistic graphs (OQMD dataset).  
- *Fluid Dynamics Forecasting:* Predicting vorticity fields for turbulent flows (channel flow simulations).  
- *Climate Modeling:* Downscaling temperature/precipitation fields from coarse-resolution inputs.  

**Metrics:**  
We evaluate: (1) downstream task accuracy (RMSE, R²), (2) data efficiency (performance vs. labeled fraction), (3) physical consistency ($ \nabla \cdot \vec{E} $ deviations), and (4) computational cost (FLOPS).  

These methods systematically address the challenges of integrating physical constraints into representation learning while providing empirical evidence of their effectiveness across diverse scientific domains.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact  

The PG-SSL framework is expected to yield significant advancements in scientific machine learning. By integrating physical inductive biases into self-supervised learning, we anticipate achieving superior data efficiency, enabling high-accuracy predictions with reduced reliance on labeled data. This outcome directly addresses the challenges of limited labeled datasets in physical sciences, as evidenced by the limitations highlighted in studies such as those by Fu et al. and Yu et al. Additionally, the framework’s emphasis on physical consistency should produce models whose predictions adhere rigorously to known conservation laws and dynamical constraints, surpassing conventional self-supervised and PINN-based baselines in terms of physical plausibility.  

Quantitatively, we expect PG-SSL to exhibit 15–30% improvements in prediction accuracy across material property prediction and fluid dynamics forecasting tasks compared to existing methods. For example, in dielectric constant prediction using the OQMD dataset, PG-SSL should outperform vanilla SSL models by leveraging physics-guided representation learning, as seen in the dual self-supervised learning framework (DSSL) proposed by Fu et al. Similarly, in fluid dynamics simulations, the framework’s integration of differentiable physics modules should reduce prediction errors in vorticity fields by ensuring adherence to Navier-Stokes constraints, addressing the limitations of standard PINNs in advection-dominated systems, as noted in the literature.  

However, challenges remain. The computational complexity of differentiable physics components may introduce additional training overhead. To mitigate this, we will implement adaptive weighting schemes in the loss function, dynamically adjusting the influence of physical constraints based on training progress, as suggested by the Physics-Guided Foundation Model (PGFM). Additionally, ensuring model interpretability while maintaining scalability across diverse domains poses a challenge. We will address this by leveraging hybrid architectures that combine GNN-based spatial reasoning with Transformer-based global pattern recognition, balancing flexibility with physical rigor as emphasized in recent surveys on physics-guided machine learning.  

The proposed framework has broad implications for scientific discovery. In materials science, PG-SSL could accelerate high-throughput screening by revealing property–structure relationships governed by physical laws. In climate modeling, its ability to enforce conservation laws could improve the fidelity of downscaling techniques for rainfall and temperature prediction. By systematically embedding physical principles into self-supervised learning, PG-SSL advances the integration of foundational ML models with domain-specific constraints, offering a blueprint for next-generation scientific AI systems. Overall, this work aligns directly with the workshop’s focus on rigorous, reproducible ML methods for the physical sciences, advancing the frontier of foundation models in scientific applications.
