Title:
Physics-Guided Self‐Supervised Learning for Foundation Models in the Physical Sciences

1. Introduction  
Background.  The intersection of machine learning (ML) and the physical sciences (PS) has led to transformative advances in simulation, modeling, and discovery.  While data‐driven foundation models have revolutionized computer vision and NLP through self‐supervised learning (SSL), their direct application to PS problems is hampered by (i) limited labeled data, (ii) the need for strict physical consistency, and (iii) domain‐specific inductive biases (e.g. conservation laws, symmetries).  Separately, physics‐informed neural networks (PINNs) and related approaches embed differential equations directly into training but often require expensive solvers and struggle with complex, chaotic systems.  There is an urgent need for a unifying framework that (a) leverages abundant unlabeled scientific data, (b) enforces physical laws, and (c) produces representations that transfer effectively across PS domains.

Research Objectives.  We propose Physics‐Guided Self‐Supervised Learning (PG‐SSL), a methodology to pretrain large neural networks on unlabeled PS data via physics‐aware pretext tasks and differentiable physics modules.  Our goals are to:  
1. Design novel self‐supervised objectives that incorporate physical constraints (e.g. mass/momentum conservation, symmetry invariance).  
2. Integrate soft physics modules—differentiable simulators or PDE solvers—into the SSL pipeline.  
3. Demonstrate that PG‐SSL representations yield superior sample efficiency and physical consistency on downstream tasks in fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and materials property prediction.

Significance.  By bridging data‐driven foundation models with physics‐informed methods, PG‐SSL stands to (i) reduce reliance on scarce labeled data, (ii) improve physical plausibility and uncertainty quantification, and (iii) foster a shared representation space for heterogeneous PS problems.  This aligns with the Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences workshop themes of bidirectional ML↔PS advances and addresses central challenges in reproducibility, simulators, and induction of physical bias into ML.

2. Methodology  
2.1 Overview of the PG‐SSL Framework  
At a high level, PG‐SSL consists of three stages: (1) Unlabeled Data Collection, (2) Physics‐Guided Pretraining, and (3) Supervised Fine‐Tuning.  Figure 1 (conceptual) shows an encoder–decoder backbone augmented by differentiable physics modules that impose soft constraints during pretraining.

2.2 Data Collection  
We will curate large unlabeled datasets from three representative domains:  
• Fluid Dynamics: High‐resolution CFD simulation data (e.g. isotropic turbulence, channel flow) of velocity fields $\mathbf{v}(x,t)$ and pressure $p(x,t)$ on structured grids.  
• Climate Modeling: Gridded reanalysis datasets (e.g. ERA5) covering temperature $T$, humidity $q$, and wind vectors on global scales.  
• Materials Science: Atomic configurations and computed properties (e.g. formation energy, band gap) from repositories such as the Materials Project, converted into graph representations.

For downstream evaluation, we will assemble small labeled subsets (10–100 samples) for tasks such as next‐frame prediction (fluids), regional climate forecasting, and materials property regression.

2.3 Physics‐Guided Pretext Tasks  
We define pretext tasks that encourage the model to learn both generic structure and physics‐specific relationships:

  a. Masked Reconstruction with Conservation Loss.  Randomly mask a fraction of input fields (e.g. velocity components) and train the model to reconstruct them.  The total pretraining loss is  
  $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{SSL}} \;=\;\alpha\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{rec}}\;+\;\beta\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{phys}}\;+\;\gamma\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}},$$  
  where  
  - $\mathcal{L}_{\text{rec}}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_i\|\hat{x}_i-x_i\|^2$ is mean‐squared reconstruction error,  
  - $\mathcal{L}_{\text{phys}}$ penalizes violation of conservation laws (e.g., for incompressible flow $\nabla\!\cdot\! \mathbf{v}=0$),  
  - $\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}$ is a generic weight‐decay regularizer.  

  For incompressible fluids, we implement  
  $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{phys}}^{\text{mass}} \;=\;\frac{1}{N}\sum_{x}\Bigl(\nabla\!\cdot\!\hat{\mathbf{v}}(x)\Bigr)^2,$$  
  and for momentum conservation over a timestep $\Delta t$:  
  $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{phys}}^{\text{mom}} \;=\;\frac{1}{N}\sum_{x}\Bigl(\hat{\mathbf{v}}(x,t+\Delta t)-\mathbf{v}(x,t)-\Delta t\cdot \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{v},p)\Bigr)^2,$$  
  where $\mathcal{N}(\cdot)$ encodes the Navier–Stokes operator.  

  b. Contrastive Dynamics with Symmetry Augmentation.  Generate two views of the same physical scene via symmetry transformations (rotations, reflections).  Use a contrastive loss (e.g. InfoNCE) that attracts representations of transformed pairs while repelling others.  This enforces physical invariances (e.g. isotropy).  

2.4 Differentiable Physics Modules  
To further incorporate domain knowledge, we embed lightweight, differentiable physics solvers into the network:

  – Navier–Stokes Module: A one‐step predictive module parameterized by known viscosity and boundary conditions, implemented via differentiable spectral or finite‐difference routines.  
  – Thermodynamics Module: For climate modeling, enforces energy and moisture balance over grid cells.  

These modules produce corrective gradients that flow back into the encoder, biasing learned features to respect PDE constraints.

2.5 Model Architecture  
Our backbone is a U‐Net–style encoder–decoder with residual connections.  The encoder $E_\phi$ maps input fields $x$ to a latent representation $z=E_\phi(x)$; the decoder $D_\theta$ reconstructs fields $\hat x=D_\theta(z)$.  Physics modules $P$ take $z$ (or intermediate features) and output predicted physical diagnostics $\hat d=P(z)$.  The joint training objective is the sum of reconstruction, physics, and contrastive terms.  

2.6 Training Procedure  
Algorithm 1 summarizes pretraining:

```

    Compute ℒ_rec, ℒ_phys using Ŷ and P(z).
    Sample symmetry transforms τ_i, build positive pairs (X,X') and compute ℒ_contrast.
    Total loss ℒ=αℒ_rec+βℒ_phys+δℒ_contrast+γ‖φ,θ‖^2.
    Update (φ,θ,P) ← (φ,θ,P) − η∇ℒ.
  end for
end for
Output: pretrained (E_φ,D_θ,P).
```

Hyperparameters (α,β,δ,γ,η) will be tuned via grid search on a validation set.

2.7 Fine‐Tuning on Downstream Tasks  
We attach lightweight task‐specific heads (e.g. forecasting, regression) to the pretrained encoder and fine‐tune on small labeled sets.  We compare two regimes: (i) freeze encoder & train head; (ii) end‐to‐end fine‐tuning.

2.8 Experimental Design and Evaluation  
Domains & Tasks:  
1. Fluid Next‐Frame Prediction (2D turbulence): Predict $\mathbf{v}(t+\Delta t)$ from $\mathbf{v}(t)$.  
2. Regional Climate Forecasting: Predict temperature fields 24 h ahead on a 50×50 grid.  
3. Materials Property Regression: Predict formation energy from atomic graphs.  

Baselines:  
– Standard SSL (e.g. SimCLR, BYOL without physics).  
– Physics‐only (PINNs, PGRNN).  
– Hybrid methods (DSSL, PGFM).  

Metrics:  
– Prediction accuracy: MAE, RMSE, $R^2$.  E.g.  
  $$\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\tfrac{1}{N}\sum_i(\hat y_i - y_i)^2}.$$  
– Physical consistency: average conservation residuals (mass, energy).  
– Sample efficiency: performance vs. number of labeled samples.  
– Generalization: train on one regime (e.g. Re=500), test on another (Re=1000).  
– Computational cost: training time per epoch, inference latency.

Ablation Studies:  
– Vary β (physics weight) to assess the trade‐off between data fidelity and law enforcement.  
– Remove contrastive loss or physics module to isolate each component’s effect.  
– Test alternative pretext tasks (e.g. auto‐encoding vs. future‐prediction).

Implementation Details:  
Use PyTorch and JAX for automatic differentiation; leverage libraries like PhiFlow for differentiable PDE solvers.  All code and pretrained checkpoints will be released under an open‐source license.

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate that PG‐SSL will:  
1. Achieve 30–50% reduction in labeled data required to reach baseline SSL performance across all domains.  
2. Yield predictions with conservation residuals near numerical solver tolerances (e.g. $\|\nabla\!\cdot\!\hat{\mathbf{v}}\|_2<10^{-4}$).  
3. Produce representations that transfer across physical regimes (e.g. from laminar to turbulent flows) and even across domains (e.g. from fluids to climate).  
4. Offer a modular, extensible framework for injecting domain‐specific physics into foundation models.

Broader Impact.  PG‐SSL addresses fundamental challenges in scientific ML: data scarcity, reproducibility, and physical interpretability.  By releasing pretrained physics‐aware models, we lower the barrier for scientists to apply deep learning in their domains with confidence that core physical laws are respected.  This bidirectional blend of ML and PS advances aligns directly with workshop goals, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue, novel open problems, and methodological cross‐pollination.  Ultimately, PG‐SSL has the potential to accelerate discovery in fluid mechanics, climate science, materials design, and beyond—ushering in a new generation of reliable, data‐efficient scientific foundation models.
