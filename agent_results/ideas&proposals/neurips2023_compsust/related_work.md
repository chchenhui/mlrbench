1. **Title**: WaveCastNet: An AI-enabled Wavefield Forecasting Framework for Earthquake Early Warning (arXiv:2405.20516)
   - **Authors**: Dongwei Lyu, Rie Nakata, Pu Ren, Michael W. Mahoney, Arben Pitarka, Nori Nakata, N. Benjamin Erichson
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces WaveCastNet, an AI-driven framework designed to forecast ground motions from large earthquakes. By integrating a convolutional Long Expressive Memory (ConvLEM) model into a sequence-to-sequence forecasting framework, WaveCastNet effectively models long-term dependencies and multi-scale patterns in both space and time. Notably, it generalizes better than transformer-based models to various seismic scenarios, including rare high-magnitude earthquakes, without requiring estimates of earthquake magnitudes and epicenters.

2. **Title**: An Attention-based Framework with Multistation Information for Earthquake Early Warnings (arXiv:2412.18099)
   - **Authors**: Yu-Ming Huang, Kuan-Yu Chen, Wen-Wei Lin, Da-Yi Chen
   - **Summary**: The authors propose SENSE, a deep learning-based framework for predicting earthquake intensity. SENSE utilizes multistation data to consider global information from a regional or national perspective, enhancing the reliability of forecasts and enabling early warnings for distant areas yet to receive seismic signals. Extensive experiments on datasets from Taiwan and Japan demonstrate SENSE's competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Data Scarcity and Quality**: In many vulnerable regions, there is a lack of comprehensive and high-quality data necessary for training robust machine learning models. This scarcity hampers the development of accurate predictive systems.

2. **Model Interpretability and Trust**: Ensuring that machine learning models are interpretable and their predictions are trustworthy is crucial for decision-makers. Black-box models can lead to skepticism and hinder adoption in critical disaster response scenarios.

3. **Ethical Considerations and Bias**: Deploying machine learning in disaster management raises ethical concerns, including potential biases in data and algorithms that may disproportionately affect certain communities. Addressing these issues is essential to ensure fairness and equity.

4. **Real-Time Processing and Deployment**: Disaster response requires real-time data processing and rapid deployment of models. Developing systems that can operate efficiently under time constraints and in resource-limited environments remains a significant challenge.

5. **Integration of Multimodal Data**: Combining diverse data sources such as satellite imagery, social media, and IoT sensor data into a cohesive model is complex. Ensuring seamless integration and effective utilization of multimodal data is critical for comprehensive disaster prediction and response.
