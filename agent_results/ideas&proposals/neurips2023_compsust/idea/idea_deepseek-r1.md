**Title:** "SustainableML: Benchmarking and Improving Model Trustworthiness for Real-World Deployment in Sustainability Applications"  

**Motivation:** Machine learning (ML) models often excel on curated benchmarks but fail in sustainability contexts due to noisy data, dynamic environments, and biases. This gap limits their practical impact on UN SDGs, as deployment reliability remains unverified.  

**Main Idea:** Develop *SustainableML*, a framework to (1) create **sustainability-focused benchmarks** that emulate real-world data challenges (e.g., spatiotemporal distribution shifts, low-resource sensors, and dataset imbalances), (2) systematically evaluate model robustness across these benchmarks, and (3) design lightweight adaptation strategies (e.g., test-time domain adaptation, uncertainty-aware active learning) to improve deployment readiness. The methodology includes curating datasets from diverse sustainability domains (e.g., biodiversity monitoring, energy systems), stress-testing models under controlled perturbations, and releasing an open-source toolkit for reproducibility. Expected outcomes include identifying failure modes of state-of-the-art models, proposing mitigation techniques, and establishing a curated repository of “sustainability failures” to guide future research. The impact lies in bridging the theory-practice gap, enabling ML models to reliably address sustainability challenges while fostering transparency through shared negative results.
