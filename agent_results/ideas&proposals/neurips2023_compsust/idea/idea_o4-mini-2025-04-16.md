Title: EcoML-Edge: A Deployment-Centric Framework for Sustainable Machine Learning

Motivation:  
Machine learning advances in sustainability often stall before real-world impact due to dynamic environments, low signal-to-noise data, and a lack of standardized deployment pathways. Without clear best practices, duplicated effort and unrevealed failure modes hinder progress toward UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Main Idea:  
EcoML-Edge is an open-source, end-to-end framework that bridges theory and field deployment for sustainable AI. Its modular pipeline includes:  
1. Digital-twin Simulator – fuses historical and synthetically-augmented data to stress-test models on edge-cases.  
2. Domain-Adversarial Pretraining – produces robust representations resilient to concept drift.  
3. Edge-Device Runtime – enables real-time inference and lightweight on-device incremental learning under intermittent connectivity.  
4. Multi-Objective Dashboard – tracks environmental, economic, and societal metrics to quantify impact.  
5. Feedback Hub – collects stakeholder insights and field telemetry to automate model recalibration.  

We’ll validate EcoML-Edge on precision irrigation and wildlife-poaching detection, targeting a ≥20% boost in resilience and resource efficiency. By providing reusable code, evaluation standards, and case studies, EcoML-Edge lays out a clear roadmap from academic prototypes to deployed solutions in computational sustainability.
