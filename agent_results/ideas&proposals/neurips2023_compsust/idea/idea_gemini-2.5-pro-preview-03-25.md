**Title:** Adaptive Meta-Learning for Robust Sustainability Forecasting under Distribution Shift

**Motivation:** Computational sustainability often deals with dynamic systems (e.g., climate patterns, species migration, resource availability) where data distributions change over time (distribution shift). Standard ML models trained on historical data often fail when deployed in these evolving environments, limiting their practical utility despite potential theoretical advances. This research addresses the pitfall of models failing to generalize temporally.

**Main Idea:** We propose an adaptive meta-learning framework specifically designed for sustainability forecasting tasks susceptible to distribution shifts. The core idea is to train a model not just to perform well on average historical data, but to quickly adapt to new, unseen data distributions characteristic of future environmental or societal states. This involves using historical time-series data to simulate future shifts and training a meta-learner to optimize model adaptation speed and performance on these simulated future tasks (e.g., few-shot rainfall prediction under changing climate patterns). Expected outcomes include more robust forecasting models for SDGs, reducing the gap between benchmark performance and real-world deployment effectiveness in dynamic sustainability contexts.
