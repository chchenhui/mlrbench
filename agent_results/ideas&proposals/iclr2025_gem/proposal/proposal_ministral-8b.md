### Title: Iterative Generative Design with Active Learning for Optimized Antibody Affinity Maturation

### Introduction

**Background:**
Antibody affinity maturation is a critical process in developing therapeutic antibodies with high binding affinity to target antigens. The traditional approach involves experimental screening of large libraries of antibody variants, which is time-consuming and costly. Generative machine learning models have shown promise in proposing antibody sequences, but their effectiveness is often limited by the need for extensive wet-lab validation. The integration of active learning frameworks can address this challenge by guiding experimental efforts towards the most promising variants, thereby optimizing resource allocation and accelerating the discovery process.

**Research Objectives:**
1. Develop a generative sequence model capable of proposing antibody variants with high binding affinity.
2. Implement an active learning framework to select a small, informative batch of variants for experimental testing.
3. Integrate wet-lab experimental results to iteratively refine both the generative and predictive models.
4. Demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in discovering potent antibodies with high binding affinity.

**Significance:**
This research aims to bridge the gap between *in silico* design and wet lab validation, thereby enhancing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of antibody affinity maturation. By combining generative machine learning with active learning, we can guide experimental efforts towards the most promising variants, accelerating the discovery of potent antibodies for therapeutic applications.

### Methodology

**Research Design:**

**1. Generative Sequence Model:**
We will utilize a state-of-the-art generative sequence model, such as ProteinMPNN or ESM-IF, to propose antibody variants based on a parent sequence. These models are trained on large datasets of antibody sequences and can generate diverse and high-quality antibody variants.

**2. Active Learning Framework:**
To select a small, informative batch of variants for experimental testing, we will employ an active learning framework. The acquisition function will be designed to balance exploration and exploitation, prioritizing variants that are either uncertain or predicted to have high binding affinity.

**3. Predictive Model for Binding Affinity:**
A separate predictive model will be used to estimate the binding affinity of the proposed variants. This model will be trained on a dataset of antibody-antigen complexes and their corresponding binding affinities. The predicted affinities will be used to guide the active learning process.

**4. Wet-Lab Experimental Validation:**
The selected variants will be experimentally tested using techniques such as yeast display or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure their binding affinities. The experimental results will be used to fine-tune both the generative and predictive models.

**5. Iterative Refinement:**
The closed-loop process will iteratively refine the models and guide subsequent experimental rounds towards variants with higher affinity. The experimental results will be fed back into the generative and predictive models, allowing them to learn from the wet-lab data and improve their performance.

**Experimental Design:**

**1. Data Collection:**
We will collect a dataset of antibody-antigen complexes and their corresponding binding affinities. This dataset will be used to train the predictive model for binding affinity.

**2. Model Training:**
The generative sequence model will be trained on a large dataset of antibody sequences. The predictive model for binding affinity will be trained on the collected dataset of antibody-antigen complexes and their binding affinities.

**3. Active Learning Process:**
The active learning process will be initialized with a parent antibody sequence. The generative sequence model will propose a batch of variants, and the acquisition function will select a small, informative batch of variants for experimental testing. The experimental results will be used to fine-tune both the generative and predictive models.

**4. Evaluation Metrics:**
The effectiveness of the proposed approach will be evaluated using metrics such as the number of experimental rounds required to discover a variant with high binding affinity, the success rate of discovering high-affinity variants, and the computational cost of the process.

### Expected Outcomes & Impact

**Expected Outcomes:**
1. A generative sequence model capable of proposing antibody variants with high binding affinity.

This research has the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of antibody affinity maturation. By integrating generative machine learning with active learning, we can guide experimental efforts towards the most promising variants, accelerating the discovery of potent antibodies for therapeutic applications. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be extended to other biomolecular design problems, where the integration of *in silico* design and wet lab validation is crucial.

In conclusion, the Iterative Generative Design with Active Learning for Optimized Antibody Affinity Maturation project aims to bridge the gap between computational and experimental approaches in antibody design.
