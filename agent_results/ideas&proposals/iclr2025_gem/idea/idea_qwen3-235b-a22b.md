1. **Title**: "Active Learning-Driven Adaptive Experimental Design for Efficient Biomolecular Optimization"  

2. **Motivation**: Traditional biomolecular design experiments are costly and time-consuming, often relying on heuristic approaches. Generative ML models, while powerful, are frequently disconnected from iterative experimental validation. This work aims to bridge this gap by developing an adaptive experimental design framework guided by active learning to minimize experimental effort while maximizing discovery efficiency.  

3. **Main Idea**: Propose an active learning system where a Gaussian Process (GP) model learns structure-function relationships from biomolecular data. The GP actively selects the most informative candidates (e.g., proteins or enzymes) for experimental testing, focusing on high-uncertainty regions. Experimental results (e.g., binding affinity, activity) are iteratively fed back to refine the model. To handle high-dimensional data (e.g., protein sequences), the GP will use kernel functions tailored to biomolecular properties, possibly incorporating graph neural networks for representation learning. High-throughput screening experiments validate the selected candidates. Expected outcomes include a significant reduction in experimental iterations and the discovery of novel biomolecules with optimized properties. This approach directly addresses the challenge of ML-experimental integration, offering a practical pipeline for labs and accelerating biomolecular engineering applications.
