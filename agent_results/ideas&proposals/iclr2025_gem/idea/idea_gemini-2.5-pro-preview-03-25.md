**Title:** Iterative Generative Design with Active Learning for Optimized Antibody Affinity Maturation

**Motivation:** Designing antibodies with high binding affinity is crucial for therapeutics but experimentally intensive. Current generative models propose candidates, yet validating numerous designs is costly. Active learning can guide experimentation, focusing resources on the most promising candidates identified by the model, bridging the gap between *in silico* design and wet lab validation.

**Main Idea:** We propose integrating a generative sequence model (e.g., ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF) with an active learning framework to guide antibody affinity maturation experiments. Initially, the model generates mutant antibody variants based on a parent sequence. An acquisition function, perhaps based on model uncertainty or predicted affinity improvement (using a separate predictor model), selects a small, informative batch of variants for experimental testing (e.g., yeast display, SPR). The wet lab results (binding affinities) are fed back to fine-tune both the generative and predictive models. This closed loop iteratively refines the models and guides subsequent experimental rounds towards variants with higher affinity, increasing the efficiency of discovering potent antibodies while minimizing experimental cost.
