**Title:** CLAD: Closed-Loop Adaptive Design for Accelerated Protein Engineering  
**Motivation:** Generative models for protein design often operate in a one-shot manner, yielding candidates that may fail experimental validation due to unmodeled biological complexity. This disconnect slows practical applications and wastes resources. Closing the loop between computational design and experimental validation is critical to enhance efficiency and reliability.  
**Main Idea:** Develop a framework where a generative model iteratively refines protein designs using real-time experimental feedback. The system combines Bayesian optimization and active learning: initial in silico designs are tested via high-throughput assays, and results (e.g., activity, stability) are fed back to retrain the model, prioritizing unexplored high-potential regions. For scalability, incorporate meta-learning to transfer insights across protein families. Validate CLAD on enzyme engineering for industrial catalysis, measuring success by reduced experimental cycles needed to achieve target functionality. Expected outcomes include a 50% reduction in wet-lab iterations compared to static ML approaches. Impact: Accelerates functional biomolecule discovery while fostering ML-biology collaboration through shared benchmarks and adaptive protocols.
