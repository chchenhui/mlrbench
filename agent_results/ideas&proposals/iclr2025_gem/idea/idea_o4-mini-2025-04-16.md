Title: Active Generative-Experimental Loop for De Novo Enzyme Engineering

Motivation:  
Current generative ML models excel in silico but often fail to translate into high-impact wet-lab results due to distribution shifts and resource-intensive validation. An adaptive, closed-loop framework that tightly couples model proposals with high-throughput assays can drastically cut experimental cycles and uncover superior biomolecules more efficiently.

Main Idea:  
We propose a microfluidics-integrated platform combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on sequence–activity pairs with droplet-based functional screens. In each iteration, the VAE generates candidate enzyme variants with uncertainty estimates; a Bayesian acquisition function selects a small batch (e.g., 50) balancing exploration/exploitation. These variants are synthesized and assayed in a droplet microfluidic reactor to measure activity and stability. Experimental readouts are fed back to update the VAE online, refining its latent landscape. By iterating this loop, the system targets >2× improvement in activity within ~200 experiments. This scalable pipeline generalizes across enzyme families and establishes a blueprint for rapid, adaptive biomolecular design.
