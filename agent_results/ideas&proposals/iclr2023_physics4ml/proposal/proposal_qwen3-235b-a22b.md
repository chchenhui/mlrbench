### Research Proposal Overview  

The research proposal titled *Geometric Conservation Laws in Neural Networks via Symplectic Architectures* focuses on integrating fundamental physics principles, specifically geometric conservation laws, into deep learning frameworks. Many real-world dynamical systems, particularly those governed by Hamiltonian mechanics, adhere to the principle of symplecticity—a mathematical property ensuring phase space volume conservation and energy preservation over time. However, conventional neural network architectures fail to incorporate such invariants, leading to models that may exhibit unphysical behavior when applied to scientific problems or suffer from unstable training in standard machine learning applications. This project aims to bridge this gap by designing neural networks with built-in symplectic structures, ensuring that each layer acts as a symplectic transformation, thereby preserving key invariants across the computational pipeline.  

The primary research idea is to construct artificial neural networks where each transformation is constrained to be a symplectic map, leveraging techniques from numerical Hamiltonian mechanics such as symplectic integration and splitting methods. By decomposing neural transformations using the formal splitting of kinetic and potential energy terms, as used in Hamiltonian system simulations, we can enforce conservation laws even when performing discrete computations. For instance, message-passing layers in graph neural networks can be designed to mimic the interactions of particles in a Hamiltonian system, ensuring energy conservation while capturing complex dependencies between nodes. Additionally, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can benefit from symplectic structures to maintain temporal coherence over long sequences.  

The broader significance of this approach lies in its potential to improve both scientific machine learning applications and classical deep learning tasks. In physics-informed learning, symplectic neural networks can enhance reliability by respecting known conservation laws, while in video prediction or time series analysis, they can enforce temporal consistency and reduce error accumulation. This work directly aligns with the "Physics for Machine Learning" workshop’s goals, promoting the development of ML methods inspired by physics to improve model robustness and generalizability.

### Background, Research Objectives, and Significance  

In both classical and scientific machine learning applications, neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success, yet they often lack structural constraints derived from physical laws, leading to models that generate unphysical or unstable predictions. This stems from their fundamental nature as general-purpose function approximators, built primarily for empirical performance rather than enforcing mathematical consistency with known physical properties. A key shortcoming is the absence of geometric conservation laws, such as symplecticity in Hamiltonian systems, which ensure the preservation of phase-space volume and energy conservation over time. Standard deep learning models do not integrate such inductive biases, resulting in drifts in conserved quantities when applied to physics-informed tasks, such as molecular and fluid dynamics simulation or time-series modeling. For classical machine learning tasks like sequence prediction and generative modeling, this omission can lead to training instabilities, poor long-term generalization, and difficulties in maintaining structural coherence over multi-step predictions.  

To address this, the primary research objective is to develop neural network architectures that inherently respect symplectic structures and other conservation laws. This involves rethinking traditional network designs by embedding symplectic transformations into individual layers, ensuring that discrete-time approximations preserve the necessary phase-space invariants. One approach is to decompose neural transformations using principles from Hamiltonian mechanics, such as splitting dynamics into kinetic and potential energy components, and applying structure-preserving numerical integration schemes. Additionally, the architecture must remain flexible enough to capture complex relationships across diverse domains, whether simulating physical systems or modeling high-dimensional sequence data. This balance between expressiveness and structure preservation is crucial for ensuring both physical consistency and predictive accuracy.  

The significance of this research lies in its potential to unify deep learning and physics-based modeling. By incorporating these constraints, neural networks can exhibit enhanced generalization, particularly in domains with limited data, while maintaining stable training dynamics even when modeling long-term dependencies. Moreover, symplectic architectures may offer novel design principles applicable to standard machine learning tasks, providing an alternative approach to maintaining temporal or structural coherence in models. This has implications beyond scientific applications, extending to time-series analysis, robotics, and reinforcement learning, where energy preservation and stability are essential.

### Methodology: Physics-Inspired Neural Networks Based on Hamiltonian Splitting and Symplectic Preservation  

The proposed methodology centers around the design and implementation of physics-inspired neural networks that inherently preserve symplecticity and other conservation laws. This will be achieved through two main mechanisms: (1) symplectic-preserving neural architectures and (2) Hamiltonian splitting-based layer decomposition. These components are critical for ensuring that the networks maintain the integrity of physical laws during both training and inference, while still achieving high predictive performance across diverse applications.

To implement symplectic-preserving architectures, the layers of the neural network will be constructed to satisfy the mathematical properties of symplectic maps. A symplectic map $ S: \mathbb{R}^{2n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2n} $ must satisfy the condition:  

$$
\nabla S(q, p)^T J \nabla S(q, p) = J
$$

where $ J $ represents the canonical symplectic matrix:  

$$
J = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & I_n \\
-I_n & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

and $ (q, p) $ denote the generalized position and momentum variables in phase space. By parameterizing these transformations to obey the above constraint, the network will conserve the system’s phase-space geometry, akin to Hamiltonian dynamics. This design draws inspiration from real NVP (arXiv:2407.00294), which enforces invertible and structure-preserving transformations, but extends its core ideas to preserve symplecticity directly as enforced by Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, higher-order explicit symplectic integration methods (arXiv:2406.04104) will guide the parameterization of transformations to maintain numerical stability in finite computational steps.

Next, the Hamiltonian splitting-based layer decomposition will be implemented by drawing on established principles of symplectic integration. Hamiltonian systems are often split into their kinetic and potential energy components, $ H(q, p) = T(p) + V(q) $, enabling separate treatment of each part while preserving overall conservation properties. In this work, we aim to model neural layers as successive applications of kinetic and potential transformations, with each step explicitly conserving the Hamiltonian structure. For example, graph neural networks will employ message-passing schemes that mimic energy-conserving interactions between nodes, inspired by the work in arXiv:2405.16183. Specifically, messages will encode forces derived from energy gradients, and node updates will mirror symplectic dynamics to ensure conservation during propagation.

Training the network will involve specialized loss functions designed to enforce symplecticity and conservation laws. These losses will integrate both a standard predictive error metric, such as mean squared error, and constraints derived from symplectic residuals (arXiv:2106.11753). For instance, a term penalizing deviations from phase-space volume conservation can be added to the loss function:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{data} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{symplecticity}
$$

where $ \mathcal{L}_{data} $ represents the task-specific predictive error, $ \mathcal{L}_{symplecticity} $ enforces the symplectic condition, and $ \lambda $ balances the tradeoff between these objectives. Experimental validation will be conducted using datasets with known Hamiltonian or symplectic dynamics, such as synthetic chaotic vortices (arXiv:2010.12636) and molecular dynamics simulations. Metrics such as predictive accuracy, energy deviation ($ \Delta H $), and phase-space volume preservation will be used to evaluate performance against standard architectures. These experiments aim to demonstrate how incorporating physics-inspired inductive biases can enhance both reliability and data efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art results on traditional metrics.

### Extending Symplectic Neural Networks Beyond Physics-Informed Applications  

While symplectic neural networks were initially developed to enforce conservation laws in physics-informed machine learning, their design principles can be extended to classical machine learning tasks. The core notion of preserving geometric structure and maintaining invariants over transformations is relevant in domains such as video prediction, sequence modeling, and generative modeling, where long-term coherence and data efficiency are critical. For instance, in video prediction, symplectic networks can ensure temporal consistency by implicitly enforcing energy conservation across frames. Similarly, in recurrent sequence modeling, such as language modeling or speech recognition, symplectic recurrence can stabilize hidden state transitions and prevent error accumulation over time. The application-specific adaptation of the methodology involves modifying how symplecticity is enforced—rather than directly mimicking Hamiltonian dynamics, classical tasks can benefit from parameterization schemes that retain the structural benefits of symplectic transformations without strictly adhering to physical equations.  

One particularly promising avenue is extending Hamiltonian mechanics-based neural networks to non-symplectic settings. While symplectic geometry is foundational for classical Hamiltonian systems, some physical and non-physical dynamical systems may exhibit conservation laws governed by non-symplectic structures such as Poisson brackets (arXiv:2305.05540). In such cases, the neural architecture must be modified to accommodate the underlying geometry, which may involve learning the appropriate brackets or designing models with degenerate structures that still guarantee conservation of certain quantities. This extension can be explored through generalized symplectic transformations, where the network does not strictly enforce the standard symplectic matrix but instead adapts to the data’s intrinsic geometric properties. Such flexibility may allow broader application, including learning mechanical systems with implicit constraints or even capturing conservation-like properties in datasets where no explicit physics equations are known.  

Data efficiency is another challenge in machine learning, particularly when applying deep learning techniques to small datasets or high-dimensional problems. Recent work in meta-learning Hamiltonian dynamics (arXiv:2305.16183) has shown that leveraging geometric constraints can mitigate data dependency by encoding priors about conservation laws into the model. Similarly, symplectic neural networks can improve data efficiency by reducing the degrees of freedom in learning, as the network must adhere to known conservation properties. This principle can be further explored in classical machine learning through the use of symplectic priors in latent space transformations, such as in variational autoencoders (VAEs) or normalizing flows. Additionally, techniques like neural deflation (arXiv:2303.15958) can help discover implicit conservation laws in the data without prior knowledge, enhancing the model’s generalizability. By integrating these concepts with standard deep learning frameworks, the proposed methodology aims to bridge the gap between physics-based inductive biases and generalizable machine learning models.

### Expected Outcomes and Potential Impact of the Research  

The anticipated outcomes of this research lie at the intersection of physics-inspired neural network design and classical machine learning, offering novel solutions to persistent challenges such as training stability, data efficiency, and physical plausibility in predictions. By structuring neural transformations to inherently respect symplecticity and energy conservation, these architectures will exhibit improved training dynamics, especially in tasks involving long-term dependencies and temporal coherence. For example, in physics-informed applications like molecular dynamics simulations, the proposed models will not only conserve system-level properties but also demonstrate reduced error accumulation over extended time steps, surpassing the performance of generic neural networks. Furthermore, the stability inherent in symplectic transformations will enable reliable training without the divergence issues common in deep learning models, which often arise from gradient instabilities or poor numerical behavior in discrete-time approximations.

Beyond training stability, the symplectic neural networks are expected to significantly enhance data efficiency, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is sparse or costly to obtain. The integration of conservation laws as inductive biases allows the model to learn accurate representations of the underlying dynamics with fewer training samples, as these constraints guide the optimization process toward physically valid solutions. This approach is especially promising for scientific machine learning applications—such as fluid dynamics or quantum mechanics—that rely on complex systems with limited observational data. For instance, by embedding symplecticity in a neural architecture, the model can leverage the prior knowledge of energy-conserving dynamics to infer accurate predictions using smaller, more manageable datasets. Additionally, this framework naturally aligns with meta-learning strategies, where insights gained from multiple Hamiltonian systems can be transferred to learn efficiently from individual systems with minimal data, as suggested by prior work (arXiv:2305.16183).

Perhaps the most groundbreaking outcome of this research is the ability of symplectic neural networks to enforce physical plausibility in predictions across diverse domains, particularly in cases where unphysical behavior could lead to significant downstream consequences. In scientific applications, such as climate modeling or astrophysics simulations, deviations from conservation laws can compound over time, producing unreliable results. The proposed models, however, will inherently enforce these laws, ensuring that predictions remain within the bounds of physical validity. Similarly, in classical machine learning tasks like video prediction or reinforcement learning, these networks can enforce consistency in transformations, producing temporally coherent outputs without the need for heuristic constraints. For example, when predicting sequences of images in video modeling, each frame transition in the generated sequence will follow the dynamics encoded within the symplectic layer, preserving energy-like properties even in the absence of explicit physical labels.

The potential impact of this research extends far beyond its immediate contributions to symplectic neural architectures. By systematically integrating geometric conservation laws into machine learning frameworks, this work sets the stage for a broader paradigm shift in how neural networks are designed and utilized. For the machine learning community, it offers a new class of models that are more reliable and generalizable, particularly in high-dimensional and low-data regimes. For the physics community, it provides tools to leverage conservation laws in data-driven modeling, enabling simulations and predictions that are fully consistent with known physical principles while remaining computationally tractable.

This unification opens exciting opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. The proposed symplectic architectures could inspire researchers in computational physics to apply machine learning in solving complex dynamical systems with better generalization and stability. Meanwhile, machine learning researchers might discover new applications for structure-preserving neural networks, such as invertibility in normalizing flows or temporal consistency in reinforcement learning environments. Furthermore, the flexibility of the framework—encompassing not only symplectic systems but also generalized conservation laws (as seen in Poisson brackets, arXiv:2305.05540)—can foster cross-domain innovation, allowing applications in areas such as robotics, where maintaining energy conservation can improve motion planning and control.

In practical terms, this research has significant implications for both academia and industry. Scientific machine learning applications stand to benefit immensely from these robust models, as tools that integrate physics’ foundational principles into deep learning pipelines are critical for advancing discovery in the physical sciences. For classical machine learning tasks, the framework provides a novel way to address problems like error accumulation in sequence modeling and the lack of explainability in black-box models, potentially leading to more interpretable and trustworthy AI systems. The success of symplectic architectures in these applications could spur further exploration of how other physical principles, such as momentum conservation or invariance under Galilean transformations, might similarly enhance machine learning methods. Ultimately, this research serves as a bridge between two disciplines, offering machine learning tools grounded in mathematical principles and creating opportunities for physicists to influence the design of next-generation models.
