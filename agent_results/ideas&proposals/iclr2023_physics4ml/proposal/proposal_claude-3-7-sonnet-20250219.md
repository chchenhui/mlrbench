# Geometric Symplectic Networks: Embedding Conservation Laws in Neural Architectures for Enhanced Learning

## 1. Introduction

Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in deep learning across numerous domains. However, despite their success, neural networks still face significant challenges: they require large amounts of training data, struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, and often produce predictions that violate fundamental physical principles. These limitations become particularly problematic in scientific applications where adherence to physical laws is crucial for meaningful predictions.

Physical systems, particularly those described by Hamiltonian mechanics, possess intrinsic geometric structures and conservation properties that govern their behavior. The symplectic structure, which preserves phase-space volume and ensures energy conservation, represents one of the most fundamental aspects of many dynamical systems. Traditional neural networks, with their unconstrained parameterizations, fail to respect these inherent properties, leading to physically implausible predictions that accumulate errors over time.

This research aims to bridge the gap between geometric mechanics and machine learning by developing novel neural network architectures that inherently preserve symplectic structures and associated conservation laws. By embedding these physical constraints directly into the network architecture rather than merely penalizing their violation in the loss function, we can create models that naturally respect the underlying physics of the systems they represent.

The key research objectives of this proposal are:

1. To develop a comprehensive framework for designing symplectic neural network architectures that inherently preserve geometric conservation laws while maintaining sufficient expressivity for complex learning tasks.

2. To implement and evaluate multiple variants of symplectic network layers based on different splitting schemes derived from geometric numerical integration methods.

3. To extend the applicability of symplectic networks beyond traditional physics applications to general machine learning tasks where conservation principles can improve performance.

4. To establish theoretical guarantees for long-term stability and generalization properties of symplectic neural networks.

The significance of this research extends across multiple dimensions. In scientific applications, symplectic networks will enable more accurate and physically consistent predictions for complex dynamical systems, from molecular dynamics to astrophysical simulations. From a machine learning perspective, embedding conservation principles provides a strong inductive bias that can reduce data requirements, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. Theoretically, this work establishes connections between geometric mechanics and deep learning, potentially leading to new insights in both fields.

## 2. Methodology

Our approach to embedding conservation laws into neural networks centers on developing architectures that inherently preserve symplectic structures. We present a comprehensive methodology that spans theoretical foundations, architectural design, implementation details, and experimental validation.

### 2.1 Theoretical Framework

We begin by formalizing the connection between Hamiltonian systems and neural networks. In Hamiltonian mechanics, a system with position coordinates $q$ and momentum coordinates $p$ evolves according to Hamilton's equations:

$$\frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}, \quad \frac{dp}{dt} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q}$$

where $H(q,p)$ is the Hamiltonian function representing the total energy. This system preserves the symplectic 2-form $\omega = \sum_i dp_i \wedge dq_i$ and consequently conserves energy and phase-space volume.

For a neural network to respect symplectic structures, its layers must implement symplectomorphisms—transformations that preserve the symplectic form. We can express this constraint mathematically: for a transformation $\Phi: (q,p) \mapsto (Q,P)$ to be symplectic, it must satisfy:

$$\sum_i dP_i \wedge dQ_i = \sum_i dp_i \wedge dq_i$$

Equivalently, if we represent the transformation as $\Phi(z)$ where $z = (q,p)$, and define the symplectic matrix $J = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & I \\ -I & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, then the symplectic condition is:

$$\Phi'(z)^T J \Phi'(z) = J$$

where $\Phi'(z)$ is the Jacobian matrix of $\Phi$ at point $z$.

### 2.2 Symplectic Network Architecture

Our proposed Geometric Symplectic Network (GSN) consists of layers that implement symplectomorphisms by design. We develop several approaches to constructing such layers:

#### 2.2.1 Hamiltonian Splitting Layers

We leverage the concept of splitting methods from geometric numerical integration. Given a Hamiltonian $H = H_1 + H_2 + ... + H_n$, the flow of the system can be approximated by composing the flows of the individual components. We parameterize each component as a neural network and ensure it produces a symplectic map.

For a separable Hamiltonian $H(q,p) = T(p) + V(q)$, where $T$ represents kinetic energy and $V$ potential energy, a second-order symplectic integration step (the Störmer-Verlet method) can be written as:

$$p_{n+1/2} = p_n - \frac{\Delta t}{2}\frac{\partial V(q_n)}{\partial q}$$
$$q_{n+1} = q_n + \Delta t\frac{\partial T(p_{n+1/2})}{\partial p}$$
$$p_{n+1} = p_{n+1/2} - \frac{\Delta t}{2}\frac{\partial V(q_{n+1})}{\partial q}$$

We implement this structure in our neural network by parameterizing $T$ and $V$ as:

$$T(p) = \frac{1}{2}p^TM(\theta)p + b_T^Tp$$
$$V(q) = \text{MLP}_V(q; \phi)$$

where $M(\theta)$ is a positive-definite matrix parameterized by $\theta$, $b_T$ is a bias vector, and $\text{MLP}_V$ is a multi-layer perceptron with parameters $\phi$.

#### 2.2.2 Generating Function Layers

Another approach involves parameterizing symplectic transformations using generating functions. A symplectic transformation can be implicitly defined through a generating function $S(q,P)$ such that:

$$p = \frac{\partial S}{\partial q}, \quad Q = \frac{\partial S}{\partial P}$$

We implement this by parameterizing $S$ as a neural network and deriving the transformation through automatic differentiation:

$$S(q,P;\theta) = q^TP + S_{\text{MLP}}(q,P;\theta)$$

where $S_{\text{MLP}}$ is a MLP with parameters $\theta$.

#### 2.2.3 Symplectic Residual Networks (SymResNets)

To enhance expressivity while maintaining symplectic properties, we develop symplectic residual blocks. These blocks approximate the flow of a time-dependent Hamiltonian system over a small time step:

$$z_{n+1} = z_n + \epsilon J \nabla_z H(z_n, t_n; \theta)$$

where $z = (q, p)$, $\epsilon$ is a small time step, and $H$ is parameterized by a neural network with parameters $\theta$.

The full GSN architecture stacks multiple symplectic layers, potentially interleaved with non-symplectic transformations that act solely on the readout portion of the network without affecting the core symplectic dynamics.

### 2.3 Training Methodology

We train GSNs using a combination of direct prediction and physics-informed objectives:

1. **Direct Prediction Loss**: Standard mean squared error between predicted and target outputs.

2. **Symplectic Consistency Loss**: Verifies that the network preserves symplectic structures by checking the symplectic condition on random input-output pairs:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{sym}} = \|(\Phi'(z))^T J \Phi'(z) - J\|_F^2$$

3. **Energy Conservation Loss**: For systems with known energy functions, we penalize energy drift:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{energy}} = |H(z_{t+\Delta t}) - H(z_t)|^2$$

The final loss function is a weighted combination:

$$\mathcal{L} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{sym}} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{energy}}$$

For general machine learning tasks where the underlying conservation laws are unknown, we can learn an implicit energy function during training.

### 2.4 Experimental Design

We will evaluate GSNs across three categories of experiments:

#### 2.4.1 Benchmark Physical Systems

#### 2.4.2 Learned Dynamics from Data

We will evaluate GSNs' ability to discover conservation laws from data without explicit physical knowledge:

1. **Noisy Observations**: Learning dynamics from noisy sensor data.
2. **Partial Observations**: Inferring dynamics when only a subset of state variables is observed.

2. **Video Prediction**: Next-frame prediction for physical scenes.
3. **Graph Neural Networks**: Particle interactions on graphs with conservation properties.
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Control tasks with underlying conservation principles.

Evaluation metrics:
