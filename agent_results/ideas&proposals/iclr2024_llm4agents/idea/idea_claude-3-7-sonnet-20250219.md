# Semantic Memory Architecture for LLM Agents with Forgetting Mechanisms

## Motivation
Current LLM agents struggle with memory management during extended interactions or complex tasks. They either forget critical information or become overwhelmed with contextual data. Human cognition, by contrast, employs sophisticated forgetting mechanisms that selectively prune less relevant information while preserving important concepts. By developing a biologically-inspired semantic memory architecture with intelligent forgetting capabilities, we can create more efficient and cognitively aligned LLM agents that maintain coherence and relevance across long-running tasks.

## Main Idea
The proposed research introduces a dual-pathway memory architecture for LLM agents: (1) a semantic network that hierarchically organizes concepts and their relationships, and (2) a forgetting mechanism that prunes this network based on recency, relevance, and importance metrics. The system continuously embeds and integrates new information into the semantic network while simultaneously applying forgetting algorithms that mimic human memory consolidation processes. This involves compressing detailed episodic memories into generalized semantic concepts over time, maintaining only the most contextually relevant information. We'll implement reinforcement learning to optimize the forgetting parameters based on task performance. Expected outcomes include improved long-term coherence, reduced context window requirements, and more human-like information retention patterns in LLM agents performing extended tasks such as research assistance or multi-session planning.
