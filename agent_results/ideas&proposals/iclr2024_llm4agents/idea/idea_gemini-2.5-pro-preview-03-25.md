**Title:** Adaptive Tool Synthesis and Integration for LLM Agents

**Motivation:** Pre-defined tool sets limit LLM agents' adaptability to novel situations and tasks. Manually adding and describing new tools is time-consuming and hinders true autonomy. This research addresses the need for agents that can dynamically expand their capabilities by learning to create and use new tools on the fly.

**Main Idea:** We propose a framework enabling LLM agents to synthesize new tools when faced with capability gaps. Upon identifying a need for a non-existent tool (e.g., a specific API call or script) via reasoning, the agent attempts to generate the tool's code or description. It then integrates this new tool into its usable set, potentially using self-correction based on execution feedback (success, failure, error messages) to refine the tool or its usage understanding. This involves meta-learning or reinforcement learning approaches where the agent learns the *process* of tool creation and grounding. The expected outcome is more autonomous, adaptable agents capable of tackling a wider range of complex tasks without manual intervention.
