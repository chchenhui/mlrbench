Title: SafeRAGâ€”Uncertainty-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Reliable Clinical Decision Support

Motivation:  
Foundation models deployed in healthcare often hallucinate or overconfidently propose wrong diagnoses, undermining trust and patient safety. Bridging large-scale language capabilities with domain-validated knowledge while quantifying model confidence is crucial for reliable in-the-wild clinical applications.

Main Idea:  
We propose SafeRAG, a pipeline that combines retrieval-augmented generation with uncertainty estimation to ensure trustworthy clinical outputs. First, a pre-trained language model queries a curated medical knowledge base (e.g., UMLS, PubMed) to retrieve contextually relevant evidence snippets. Next, we perform ensemble-based uncertainty estimation (e.g., Monte Carlo dropout) on the generated responses. If uncertainty exceeds a learned threshold, SafeRAG:  
1. Expands the retrieval scope (multi-hop retrieval across linked sources).  
2. Prompts the model with additional chain-of-thought templates emphasizing evidence citation.  
3. Falls back to a human-in-the-loop review when confidence remains low.  

Expected outcomes include calibrated confidence scores, reduced hallucination rates, and improved accuracy on clinical QA benchmarks. By transparently integrating evidence and uncertainty, SafeRAG aims to foster safer, more responsible FM deployments in healthcare.
