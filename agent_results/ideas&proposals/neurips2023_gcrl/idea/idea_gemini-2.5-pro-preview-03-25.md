**Title:** Few-Shot Goal-Conditioned Molecular Generation via Latent Space Exploration

**Motivation:** Current molecular generation often requires extensive data or complex reward engineering. Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) offers an intuitive alternative by specifying desired properties (goals) via example molecules or property values. However, achieving effective generation with very few examples (few-shot) remains challenging. This research aims to enable rapid discovery of novel molecules with specific targeted properties using only a handful of desired examples.

**Main Idea:** We propose a GCRL framework where the agent learns a policy to navigate a pre-trained, smooth molecular latent space (e.g., from a VAE or normalizing flow). Goals are specified by embedding desired molecular properties or example molecules into this latent space. The agent is trained using a GCRL algorithm (e.g., leveraging Hindsight Experience Replay) to reach goal regions corresponding to desired properties. Crucially, we will incorporate metric learning techniques on the goal embeddings to enable effective generalization from few examples. Expected outcomes include efficient generation of diverse molecules meeting specific criteria (e.g., high binding affinity, targeted solubility) using significantly fewer goal samples than current methods, accelerating materials and drug discovery.
