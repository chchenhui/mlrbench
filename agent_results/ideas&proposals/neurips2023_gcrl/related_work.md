**Key Challenges:**

1. **Sparse Reward Environments**: Many goal-conditioned reinforcement learning tasks operate in environments where rewards are infrequent or absent, making it difficult for agents to learn effective policies.

2. **Sample Inefficiency**: Training agents in complex domains often requires a large number of samples, leading to high computational costs and prolonged training times.

3. **Lack of Rich Goal-State Representations**: Existing methods may overlook the relational structure between goals and states, resulting in suboptimal generalization and adaptability.

4. **Transferability Across Tasks**: Developing agents that can effectively transfer learned policies across diverse tasks remains a significant challenge, limiting the scalability of reinforcement learning solutions.

5. **Interpretable Latent Spaces**: Creating latent spaces that are both interpretable and useful for causal goal reasoning is essential for real-world deployment but remains an open problem.
