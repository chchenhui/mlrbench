# Enhancing Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning through Self-Supervised Goal Representation Learning  

## Introduction  

### Background  
Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) enables agents to learn policies that achieve user-specified goals without manually designed reward functions. However, GCRL faces critical challenges in sparse-reward environments (e.g., molecular design, robotics) and suffers from sample inefficiency due to the lack of structured exploration. Traditional methods often treat goals and states as independent entities, ignoring their relational structure and temporal dependencies. Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) and contrastive representation learning offer a pathway to address these limitations by distilling task-agnostic knowledge into continuous representations. For instance, contrastive abstraction learning (Patil et al., 2024) clusters states into abstract representations, while hierarchical attention networks (White et al., 2023) capture temporal dependencies. Despite progress, existing approaches fail to align temporally distant goals or generalize across tasks with compositional complexity (e.g., multi-step molecule synthesis).  

### Research Objectives  
This work proposes a two-stage framework that integrates self-supervised goal representation learning with GCRL to:  
1. Learn a **context-aware, metric-shared goal-state representation** via contrastive learning on diverse experience sequences.  
2. Enable **dynamic goal relabeling** and **abstract subgoal inference** through a novel contrastive loss that aligns temporally distant goals.  
3. Improve **sample efficiency** and **compositional generalization** in sparse-reward domains (e.g., Meta-World, 3D molecular generation).  

### Significance  
By bridging GCRL with SSL and representation learning, this research addresses key challenges in sparse rewards, transferability, and interpretable latent spaces. The proposed method reduces reliance on hand-engineered rewards, enabling deployment in real-world scenarios like precision medicine and instruction-following robotics. Additionally, it advances theoretical connections between GCRL, causal reasoning, and metric learning.

## Methodology  

### Research Design  
The framework consists of two stages (Figure 1):  
1. **Self-Supervised Representation Learning**: A hierarchical attention network learns goal-state embeddings using contrastive loss on unsupervised experience.  
2. **Goal-Conditioned Policy Learning**: A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent operates in the learned representation space, augmented with dynamic goal relabeling.  

#### Stage 1: Self-Supervised Goal-State Representation Learning  
**Data Collection**:  
- Agents collect trajectories $ \tau = \{(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})\}_{t=1}^T $ through random exploration in the environment.  
- Goals $ g $ are sampled from terminal states of trajectories or external datasets (e.g., molecular graphs).  

**Hierarchical Attention Encoder**:  
Goals and states are encoded using a hierarchical attention mechanism (White et al., 2023):  
- **Temporal Attention**: Computes attention weights $ \alpha_t $ over time steps:  
  $$  
  \alpha_t = \text{Softmax}(W_h h_t + b_h),  
  $$  
  where $ h_t $ is the hidden state at time $ t $, and $ W_h, b_h $ are learnable parameters.  
- **Feature Attention**: Refines embeddings by attending to input features:  
  $$  
  z = \sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_t \cdot \text{MLP}(s_t),  
  $$  
  where $ z $ is the final representation.  

**Context-Aware Contrastive Loss**:  
Positive pairs $ (z_i^+, z_j^+) $ are co-occurring goal-state pairs from successful trajectories; negatives $ z_k^- $ are sampled from unrelated contexts. The loss aligns temporally distant goals:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i^+, z_j^+)/\tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i^+, z_j^+)/\tau) + \sum_{k=1}^N \exp(\text{sim}(z_i^+, z_k^-)/\tau)},  
$$  
where $ \text{sim}(\cdot, \cdot) $ is cosine similarity and $ \tau $ is a temperature hyperparameter.  

#### Stage 2: Goal-Conditioned Policy Learning  
**Agent Architecture**:  
- The SAC agent uses the encoder $ E_\theta $ from Stage 1 to map states $ s $ and goals $ g $ into representations $ z_s, z_g $.  
- Q-networks compute goal-conditioned values:  
  $$  
  Q(s, a, g) = \text{MLP}([z_s; z_g; a]),  
  $$  
  where $ [;] $ denotes concatenation.  

**Dynamic Goal Relabeling**:  
- HER (Hindsight Experience Replay) is augmented with learned representations: failed trajectories are relabeled with achieved goals $ g' = \text{argmax}_{g_k^-} \text{sim}(z_{g_k^-}, z_{s_T}) $.  
- Subgoals are inferred via k-means clustering in the representation space.  

**Training Procedure**:  
1. Pretrain the encoder using $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} $ on unsupervised trajectories.  
2. Freeze encoder weights and train SAC with relabeled goals in the learned space.  

### Experimental Design  

#### Domains:  
1. **Meta-World (Continuous Control)**: Sparse-reward tasks (e.g., door opening, peg insertion).  
2. **3D Molecular Generation (Discrete Action)**: Synthesize molecules with target properties (e.g., drug-likeness).  

#### Baselines:  
- HER + SAC (handcrafted rewards)  
- JaxGCRL (Bortkiewicz et al., 2024)  
- Contrastive abstraction learning (Patil et al., 2024)  

#### Evaluation Metrics:  
1. **Success Rate**: Percentage of episodes achieving the goal.  
2. **Sample Efficiency**: Number of environment steps to reach 90% success.  
3. **Compositional Generalization**: Performance on unseen goal combinations (e.g., novel molecular scaffolds).  
4. **Latent Space Quality**: Cluster separation (Silhouette Score) and interpretability via t-SNE.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Scientific Contributions  
1. **Novel Framework**: First integration of hierarchical attention and context-aware contrastive learning in GCRL, enabling temporal alignment of goals.  
2. **Theoretical Insights**: Formalizes connections between GCRL, SSL, and causal reasoning through interpretable latent spaces.  
3. **Benchmark Advancement**: Open-source implementation for Meta-World and molecular generation tasks.  

### Technical Advancements  
1. **Improved Sample Efficiency**: Expect 2–5× reduction in training steps compared to HER and JaxGCRL.  
2. **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Demonstrate policy transfer from molecular design to robotics via shared representation space.  
3. **Interpretable Subgoals**: Extract human-readable subgoals (e.g., "form aromatic ring" in molecule synthesis).  

### Real-World Applications  
1. **Precision Medicine**: Accelerate drug discovery by specifying molecular goals via natural language or protein structures.  
2. **Robotics**: Enable instruction-following agents without reward engineering (e.g., "assemble X, then paint Y").  

### Limitations & Future Work  
- **Scalability**: Training on high-dimensional inputs (e.g., 3D point clouds) may require distributed computing.  
- **Bias in Pretraining**: Representation quality depends on exploration diversity in Stage 1.
