**1. Title:** **Self-Supervised Context-Aware Goal Representations for Enhanced Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) represents a significant paradigm shift in reinforcement learning, allowing agents to pursue desired outcomes specified simply by an observation of the goal state, rather than requiring meticulously engineered reward functions [Eysenbach et al., 2019]. This flexibility makes GCRL particularly promising for complex, real-world domains such as robotics [Andrychowicz et al., 2017], instruction following [Lynch et al., 2020], language model alignment [Nath et al., 2024], and molecular design [Zhou et al., 2023]. As highlighted by the workshop call, GCRL lies at the intersection of several key machine learning fields, including self-supervised learning (SSL), representation learning, metric learning, and probabilistic inference, offering fertile ground for theoretical insights and algorithmic advancements.

However, deploying GCRL effectively faces significant hurdles. Chief among these are the challenges of sample inefficiency and poor performance in environments with sparse or delayed rewards [Schaul et al., 2015]. In such settings, random exploration rarely yields successful trajectories, making it difficult for the agent to learn meaningful goal-directed policies. Furthermore, many current GCRL methods treat states and goals independently or use generic distance metrics (e.g., L2 distance in raw observation space or a pretrained VAE space), potentially overlooking the rich, underlying relational and temporal structure connecting sequences of states to overarching goals [Patil et al., 2024]. Learning effective representations that capture this structure is crucial for generalization across tasks and goals, enabling agents to reason about subgoals and transfer knowledge efficiently.

Recent advances in self-supervised learning, particularly contrastive methods, have shown remarkable success in learning powerful representations from unlabeled data across various domains [Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020]. These techniques learn representations by maximizing agreement between differently augmented views of the same data point (positive pairs) while minimizing agreement with other data points (negative pairs). Applying SSL principles within the GCRL framework offers a compelling avenue to learn semantically meaningful, task-relevant representations of states and goals directly from autonomously collected experience, thereby addressing the aforementioned challenges [Bortkiewicz et al., 2024; Nath et al., 2024].

**2.2 Problem Statement**
Standard GCRL algorithms often struggle with:
1.  **Sparse Rewards:** Difficulty in learning when extrinsic success signals are rare, leading to poor sample efficiency.
2.  **Representation Quality:** Simple goal representations (e.g., raw states, fixed embeddings) may fail to capture the necessary invariances and relational structure for effective planning and generalization. The complex relationship between distant states and abstract goals is often ignored.
3.  **Generalization and Transfer:** Difficulty transferring learned skills to new, unseen goals or slight variations in the environment dynamics without extensive retraining.
4.  **Subgoal Discovery:** Inability to intrinsically discover and leverage hierarchical or temporal structure (e.g., subgoals) within complex tasks.

While some works have started exploring SSL for GCRL [Doe et al., 2023; Cyan et al., 2023], they often focus on aligning representations based on immediate temporal proximity or simple positive/negative sampling from trajectories. They may lack mechanisms to explicitly capture the long-range dependencies and contextual relationships inherent in complex, multi-stage tasks, limiting their ability to reason about abstract goal hierarchies or transfer knowledge effectively across temporally distant goals.

**2.3 Proposed Solution & Research Objectives**
This research proposes a novel framework, **S**elf-**S**upervised **C**ontext-**A**ware **G**oal **R**epresentation **L**earning (SCALR), to enhance GCRL performance by learning rich, structured representations of states and goals. SCALR integrates a dedicated self-supervised learning module with a standard GCRL agent within a two-stage training process.

The core innovation lies in the design of the SSL module, which employs:
1.  **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms:** To effectively process complex state and goal observations (e.g., sequences of states, structured data like molecules) and capture salient features relevant to the goal-directed task [White et al., 2023].
2.  **Context-Aware Contrastive Loss:** A novel contrastive objective designed to align the representations of states and goals not just based on co-occurrence in successful trajectories, but also considering the temporal context and potential hierarchical relationship between them [Inspired by Black et al., 2023]. This encourages the representation space to capture implicit subgoal structures and facilitates generalization across tasks with shared underlying structure.

The learned representation space serves as a shared metric space for both states and goals, which is then leveraged by a GCRL agent (e.g., Soft Actor-Critic with Hindsight Experience Replay) for more effective policy learning and goal relabeling.

**Research Objectives:**

1.  **Develop the SCALR Framework:** Design and implement the two-stage framework combining hierarchical attention-based encoders, the context-aware contrastive SSL module, and a GCRL agent (e.g., SAC+HER).
2.  **Formulate and Implement the Context-Aware Contrastive Loss:** Mathematically define and implement the novel loss function that encourages alignment between state representations and temporally distant goal representations within successful trajectories, potentially weighting pairs based on temporal distance or trajectory structure.
3.  **Evaluate Sample Efficiency:** Quantify the improvement in sample efficiency (learning speed and final performance) achieved by SCALR compared to baseline GCRL algorithms and simpler SSL-GCRL methods on challenging sparse-reward benchmarks (e.g., Meta-World).
4.  **Assess Generalization and Transfer:** Measure the ability of SCALR to generalize to unseen goals within a task distribution and potentially transfer learned representations or policies across different tasks (e.g., compositional generalization in robotics or molecular design).
5.  **Analyze Representation Quality:** Qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the learned goal-state representation space (e.g., using t-SNE/UMAP visualizations, downstream task suitability) to understand if it captures meaningful semantic and temporal structure, potentially enabling interpretable reasoning [Violet et al., 2023].

**2.4 Significance and Contributions**
This research aims to make significant contributions aligned with the workshop's themes:

*   **Algorithms:** Proposes a novel, potentially more sample-efficient and generalizable GCRL algorithm (SCALR) by integrating advanced SSL techniques.
*   **Connections:** Explicitly bridges GCRL with representation learning and self-supervised learning, investigating how structured representations learned via context-aware contrastive objectives can benefit goal-conditioned decision-making [Purple et al., 2023].
*   **Future Directions:** Addresses limitations of existing methods concerning sparse rewards, representation learning, and generalization, potentially opening avenues for more complex applications.
*   **Applications:** By improving efficiency and generalization, SCALR could facilitate the application of GCRL to challenging real-world domains highlighted by the workshop, such as robotics (e.g., long-horizon manipulation) and molecular discovery (e.g., generating molecules with specific property profiles).
*   **Interpretability:** The learned latent space might offer improved interpretability regarding goal relationships and task structure, potentially contributing to causal goal reasoning.

Successfully achieving the research objectives would advance the state-of-the-art in GCRL, providing both theoretical insights into the interplay between representation learning and goal-directed behaviour, and a practical algorithmic framework for tackling complex sequential decision-making problems.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Research Design**
The proposed research follows a two-stage methodological approach:
1.  **Stage 1: Self-Supervised Representation Learning:** An encoder network (parameterized by $\psi$) learns a shared embedding function $\phi: \mathcal{S} \cup \mathcal{G} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^d$ for states ($s \in \mathcal{S}$) and goals ($g \in \mathcal{G}$) into a $d$-dimensional latent space. This learning is driven by a context-aware contrastive loss applied to trajectories collected from the environment(s).
2.  **Stage 2: Goal-Conditioned Policy Learning:** A GCRL agent (e.g., SAC) learns a policy $\pi(a | s, g)$ and associated Q-function $Q(s, a, g)$ using the learned, fixed representations $\phi(s)$ and $\phi(g)$. Goal relabeling strategies like Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) operate within this learned latent space.

These stages can be performed sequentially (pre-training $\phi$ then training $\pi, Q$) or interleaved/concurrently, depending on stability and performance trade-offs explored during development.

**3.2 Data Collection**
Experience will be collected by the agent interacting with the chosen environments (described in Sec 3.5). Data consists of trajectories $\tau = (s_0, a_0, r_0, s_1, ..., s_T)$. During the SSL phase, rewards $r_t$ might be ignored or used minimally (e.g., to identify successful trajectories). The data collection process will be standard RL interaction loops, potentially involving exploration strategies suitable for sparse reward settings (e.g., goal-sampling strategies).

**3.3 Algorithmic Details**

**Stage 1: Self-Supervised Representation Learning**

*   **Encoder Architecture ($\phi_\psi$):** The architecture will be environment-dependent.
    *   For state-based environments (e.g., Meta-World): Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) or potentially Transformers operating on state vectors.
    *   For vision-based environments (if explored): Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) followed by MLPs.
    *   For molecular generation: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode molecular structures.
    *   **Hierarchical Attention:** To capture temporal or structural context, hierarchical attention mechanisms [White et al., 2023] will be integrated. For sequential data, this could involve attention over time steps within a trajectory segment. For structured data like molecules, attention could operate over atoms/bonds and substructures. The goal is to allow the encoder to dynamically focus on the most relevant parts of the input state/goal relative to the context. The output of the attention layers will feed into the final embedding layer producing $\phi(s)$ or $\phi(g)$.

*   **Context-Aware Contrastive Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{CA-SSL}$):** We adapt the standard InfoNCE loss. Given a batch of trajectories, we sample anchor states $s_t$ from these trajectories.
    *   **Positive Pair Sampling:** For an anchor $s_t$, positive goals $g^+$ are sampled from the *future* of the same trajectory, i.e., $g^+ = s_k$ where $k > t$. Critically, to encourage context awareness and representation of long-range dependencies, we can employ strategies like:
        *   Sampling goals $s_k$ across various time horizons ($k-t$ varies).
        *   Prioritizing goals from successful trajectories if available.
        *   Potentially sampling "abstract" goals representing trajectory segments or subgoals identified via the hierarchical attention mechanism.
    *   **Negative Pair Sampling:** Negative goals $g^-$ are sampled from different trajectories or different time steps within the same trajectory that are contextually dissimilar (e.g., states from failed trajectories, or states temporally distant and unrelated to the current anchor's future).
    *   **Loss Formulation:** The loss pushes the representation of the anchor state $\phi(s_t)$ closer to positive goals $\phi(g^+)$ and further from negative goals $\phi(g^-)$:
        $$
        \mathcal{L}_{CA-SSL}(\psi) = - \mathbb{E}_{\substack{(s_t, g^+) \sim \mathcal{P}_{pos} \\ \{g^-_j\}_{j=1}^N \sim \mathcal{P}_{neg}}} \left[ \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(\phi_\psi(s_t), \phi_\psi(g^+)) / \tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(\phi_\psi(s_t), \phi_\psi(g^+)) / \tau) + \sum_{j=1}^N \exp(\text{sim}(\phi_\psi(s_t), \phi_\psi(g^-_j)) / \tau)} \right]
        $$
        Here, $\text{sim}(u, v) = u^T v / (||u|| ||v||)$ is the cosine similarity, $\tau$ is a temperature hyperparameter, $\mathcal{P}_{pos}$ defines the context-aware positive sampling strategy, and $\mathcal{P}_{neg}$ defines the negative sampling strategy. The "context-aware" aspect is primarily embedded in the sampling strategy $\mathcal{P}_{pos}$, potentially augmented by weighting terms in the similarity function based on temporal distance or trajectory success, inspired by [Black et al., 2023].

*   **Training:** The encoder $\phi_\psi$ is trained using Adam [Kingma & Ba, 2014] or similar optimizers by minimizing $\mathcal{L}_{CA-SSL}$ over batches of collected trajectory data stored in a replay buffer.

**Stage 2: Goal-Conditioned Policy Learning**

*   **GCRL Algorithm:** We will primarily use Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [Haarnoja et al., 2018] adapted for the goal-conditioned setting.
    *   **Inputs:** The policy network $\pi_\theta(a | \phi(s), \phi(g))$ and the critic (Q-function) networks $Q_{\omega_1}( \phi(s), a, \phi(g))$, $Q_{\omega_2}( \phi(s), a, \phi(g))$ take the learned, fixed representations $\phi(s)$ and $\phi(g)$ as input.
    *   **Objective:** SAC optimizes a maximum entropy objective:
        $$
        J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1}, g) \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ r_t + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{a_{t+1} \sim \pi_\theta(\cdot|s_{t+1}, g)} [Q_{\bar{\omega}}(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}, g) - \alpha \log \pi_\theta(a_{t+1}|s_{t+1}, g)] \right]
        $$
        The Q-functions are learned via Temporal Difference (TD) learning, minimizing the Bellman error using target networks $\bar{\omega}$. The temperature $\alpha$ controlling the entropy bonus can be learned automatically.

*   **Hindsight Experience Replay (HER):** We will use HER [Andrychowicz et al., 2017] with the 'future' strategy. For a transition $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$ sampled from a trajectory originally aimed at goal $g$, HER creates additional transitions aimed at fictitious goals $g'$. A common strategy is to sample $k$ future states $s_{k'}$ ($k' > t$) from the same trajectory and use them as goals $g' = s_{k'}$. The reward for this hypothetical transition is computed based on whether the achieved state $s_{t+1}$ satisfies the fictitious goal $g'$, using the learned representation distance:
    $$
    r'_{t} = R(s_{t+1}, g') = \mathbb{I}(d(\phi(s_{t+1}), \phi(g')) < \epsilon)
    $$
    where $d(u, v) = ||u - v||_2$ is the Euclidean distance in the latent space and $\epsilon$ is a small threshold. The learned metric space $\phi$ is expected to make this relabeling more effective than using raw states.

*   **Training:** The policy $\pi_\theta$ and Q-functions $Q_\omega$ are trained using transitions sampled from the replay buffer, augmented with HER. The encoder $\phi_\psi$ remains fixed during this stage (in the sequential approach) or can be fine-tuned slowly (in the concurrent approach).

**3.4 Experimental Design**

*   **Environments:**
    1.  **Meta-World Benchmark:** [Yu et al., 2019] Provides a suite of continuous control robotic manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. We will focus on MT10 and potentially MT50 benchmarks to evaluate multi-task learning and generalization. The sparse reward setting directly tests sample efficiency.
    2.  **3D Molecular Generation (e.g., using GFlowNets or RL frameworks like [Zhou et al., 2023]):** A discrete action domain where the state is the current molecule (represented as a graph) and the goal is a desired set of chemical properties (e.g., Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED), Synthetic Accessibility (SA)). Actions involve adding atoms or bonds. This tests the framework's applicability beyond continuous control in a structured, high-dimensional state-action space. Goals can be complex property vectors.

*   **Baselines for Comparison:**
    1.  **SAC + HER:** Standard GCRL algorithm using raw states or a simple fixed encoder (e.g., identity or MLP).
    2.  **UVFA (Universal Value Function Approximators):** [Schaul et al., 2015] A foundational GCRL approach.
    3.  **CURL (Contrastive Unsupervised Representations for RL):** [Laskin et al., 2020] Represents an established method combining contrastive SSL with RL, although not specifically designed for GCRL's goal representation aspect. We can adapt its principles.
    4.  **Simple SSL-GCRL:** A variant of our method using a standard contrastive loss (e.g., aligning state $s_t$ only with the final goal $g$ of successful trajectories) without context-awareness or hierarchical attention.
    5.  Potentially recent relevant work like [Patil et al., 2024] or [Bortkiewicz et al., 2024] if implementations are available or reproducible.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Sample Efficiency:** Learning curves plotting Success Rate / Average Return vs. Environment Steps or Wall-clock Time. Key metrics include steps to reach a target success rate and final asymptotic performance. Using standardized evaluation protocols like [Bortkiewicz et al., 2024] where possible.
    2.  **Generalization:**
        *   *Intra-task:* Performance on unseen goals within the same task distribution.
        *   *Inter-task (Compositional):* For Meta-World MT50, performance on the held-out tasks. For molecules, performance when targeting combinations of properties not seen during training. Zero-shot or few-shot performance will be assessed.
    3.  **Representation Quality:**
        *   *Visualization:* t-SNE or UMAP plots of $\phi(s)$ and $\phi(g)$ embeddings, colored by task, success, or temporal position, to visually inspect structure.
        *   *Metric Properties:* Analysis of the distance metric $d(\phi(s_1), \phi(s_2))$ in the latent space – does it correlate with true state distance or trajectory progress?
        *   *Linear Probe Accuracy:* Train a linear classifier on top of frozen $\phi(s)$ representations to predict task ID, success, or other relevant properties.

*   **Ablation Studies:** To isolate the contribution of each component:
    1.  SCALR without Hierarchical Attention.
    2.  SCALR without the Context-Aware aspect of the loss (using simpler positive sampling).
    3.  SCALR without the SSL stage (training SAC+HER directly with the same encoder architecture initialized randomly).
    4.  Impact of different positive/negative sampling strategies for $\mathcal{L}_{CA-SSL}$.
    5.  Sequential vs. concurrent training of SSL and RL stages.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**
1.  **A Validated SCALR Framework:** A functional implementation of the proposed two-stage GCRL framework incorporating hierarchical attention and context-aware contrastive learning.
2.  **Improved Sample Efficiency:** Demonstrable improvements in learning speed (fewer environment interactions to reach target performance) and potentially higher final performance compared to baseline GCRL algorithms on sparse-reward benchmarks like Meta-World.
3.  **Enhanced Generalization:** Evidence that SCALR achieves better zero-shot or few-shot generalization to novel goals and potentially related tasks, particularly in compositional settings (robotics, molecular design).
4.  **Structured Latent Representations:** Qualitative and quantitative analyses showing that the learned latent space $\phi$ captures meaningful semantic relationships between states and goals, reflects temporal progression, and distinguishes between successful and unsuccessful trajectory contexts. The distance metric $d(\phi(s), \phi(g))$ should prove more effective for HER relabeling than baseline metrics.
5.  **Insights into GCRL+SSL Synergy:** A clearer understanding of how specific SSL design choices (context-awareness, hierarchical attention) impact GCRL performance, particularly regarding long-horizon tasks and subgoal discovery.

**4.2 Potential Impact**
This research directly addresses the core themes of the workshop by exploring the intersection of GCRL, SSL, and representation learning.

*   **Theoretical Impact:** It will contribute to understanding how self-supervision can be tailored to distill task-relevant structure (including temporal and hierarchical context) into representations useful for goal-conditioned control. It provides a concrete testbed for exploring how representation structure influences generalization and transfer in RL.
*   **Algorithmic Advancement:** SCALR has the potential to become a strong baseline GCRL algorithm, particularly valuable in domains where reward engineering is difficult and sample efficiency is paramount. The context-aware loss mechanism could inspire further research into representation learning objectives that capture complex relational structures in sequential data.
*   **Practical Implications:** By improving the efficiency and robustness of GCRL, this work could lower the barrier for applying RL to complex, real-world problems.
    *   **Robotics:** Enabling robots to learn complex manipulation skills with less data and generalize better to new objects or target configurations.
    *   **Molecular Discovery:** Accelerating the design of molecules with specific desired properties by allowing the agent to better navigate the vast chemical space using learned structural representations.
    *   **Other Domains:** The principles could potentially extend to areas like dialogue systems (goal-oriented dialogues), game playing (complex strategy games), and personalized education (adapting Tutors based on learning goals).
*   **Contribution to Workshop Goals:** The research directly tackles questions about the connections between GCRL and representation/self-supervised learning, proposes a new algorithm addressing limitations of existing methods, and aims to enable broader applications, aligning perfectly with the workshop's focus. The findings will stimulate discussion on effective representation learning strategies for goal-directed behaviour. Furthermore, the potential for more structured and interpretable latent spaces could offer insights relevant to causal reasoning within GCRLs.

In summary, this research promises to deliver a novel and effective GCRL algorithm grounded in principled integration of self-supervised representation learning, contributing valuable insights and tools to the rapidly evolving field of goal-conditioned decision making.
