**Bridging Self-Supervised Representation Learning and Goal-Conditioned RL: A Hierarchical Contrastive Framework for Sparse-Reward Domains**

### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) enables agents to pursue diverse objectives by conditioning policies on goal states. However, key challenges persist:  
- **Sparse rewards** in complex tasks (e.g., molecular design) lead to inefficient exploration.  
- Existing methods often use handcrafted reward functions or simplistic goal representations, ignoring relational structures between states and goals.  
- Limited **compositional generalization** across tasks due to poor transferability of learned policies.  

Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) and contrastive representation learning offer promising solutions. For instance, JaxGCRL (Bortkiewicz et al., 2024) demonstrates accelerated training via contrastive RL, while Nath et al. (2024) align language model rewards using goal-conditioned SSL. However, no framework systematically integrates hierarchical goal-state relational reasoning with SSL to address GCRL’s core challenges.  

**Research Objectives**  
1. Develop a **hierarchical contrastive learning module** to learn metric-shared goal-state representations that capture temporal and relational dependencies.  
2. Design a **context-aware contrastive loss** to align distant goal representations, enabling abstract subgoal inference.  
3. Integrate SSL-derived representations into a GCRL agent (e.g., SAC) to improve sample efficiency and zero-shot transfer in sparse-reward domains.  
4. Validate the framework on robotics (Meta-World) and molecular generation tasks, assessing compositional generalization and interpretability.  

**Significance**  
This work bridges GCRL with SSL, addressing critical gaps in reward engineering and sample efficiency. By enabling agents to infer subgoals and transfer policies across tasks, it has broad applications in:  
- **Precision medicine**: Optimizing molecular structures with minimal reward engineering.  
- **Robotics**: Accelerating skill transfer in multi-task environments.  
- **Causal reasoning**: Providing interpretable latent spaces to analyze goal dependencies.

### 3. **Methodology**  
**Research Design**  
The framework operates in two stages:  

#### **Stage 1: Self-Supervised Goal Representation Learning**  
**Data Collection**  
- Collect diverse trajectories $\tau = \{(s_t, a_t, g_t)\}$ from a replay buffer, where $g_t$ is the final goal or intermediate subgoals.  
- For each trajectory, sample **positive pairs** $(s_i, g_j)$ where $s_i$ and $g_j$ co-occur in successful trajectories, and **negative pairs** $(s_i, g_k)$ from unrelated trajectories.  

**Hierarchical Attention Encoder**  
- Encode states and goals using a shared transformer with hierarchical attention:  
  - **Temporal Attention**: Captures dependencies between states across time.  
  - **Relational Attention**: Models interactions between state and goal features.  
- The encoder outputs embeddings $z_s = f_\theta(s)$ and $z_g = f_\phi(g)$ with parameters $\theta, \phi$.  

**Context-Aware Contrastive Loss**  
Maximize similarity between positive pairs while minimizing similarity for negatives, with a temperature parameter $\tau$:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{cont}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_s, z_g^+) / \tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^K \exp(\text{sim}(z_s, z_g^k) / \tau)}
$$  
where $\text{sim}(u, v) = u^T v / \|u\| \|v\|$. To align temporally distant goals, we extend this with a **temporal consistency term**:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{temp}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \|f_\theta(s_t) - f_\theta(s_{t+\Delta})\|^2
$$  
The total loss is $\mathcal{L}_{\text{SSL}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{cont}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{temp}}$, where $\lambda$ balances terms.  

#### **Stage 2: Goal-Conditioned RL with Dynamic Goal Relabeling**  
**Policy Learning**  
- Use Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with goal-conditioned Q-values:  
  $$
  Q(s, a, g) = \mathbb{E}\left[ r(s, g) + \gamma V(s', g) \right]
  $$  
  where $V(s', g)$ is the value function using the SSL-derived embeddings.  

**Dynamic Goal Relabeling**  
During replay, replace original goals $g$ with **inferred subgoals** from the SSL module to improve exploration:  
$$
g_{\text{new}} = \arg\max_{g'} \text{sim}(z_{s_{\text{current}}}, z_{g'})
$$  

**Experimental Design**  
- **Environments**:  
  - *Meta-World*: 10 sparse-reward robotic manipulation tasks (e.g., "Pick-Place").  
  - *3D Molecular Generation*: Generate molecules with target properties (e.g., solubility, binding affinity).  
- **Baselines**: Compare against Hindsight Experience Replay (HER), JaxGCRL, and hierarchical GCRL (White et al., 2023).  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Success Rate**: Percentage of episodes where the goal is achieved.  
  - **Sample Efficiency**: Number of episodes to reach 80% success rate.  
  - **Transfer Performance**: Zero-shot success rate on unseen tasks (e.g., "Assembly" after training on "Pick-Place").  
  - **Interpretability**: Analyze clustering in latent space using t-SNE and causal graph metrics.  

**Ablation Studies**  
- Remove temporal consistency term ($\lambda = 0$).  
- Replace hierarchical attention with standard MLP encoders.  
- Disable dynamic goal relabeling.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Sample Efficiency**: 30–50% reduction in training samples required to achieve baseline performance in Meta-World tasks.  
2. **Enhanced Generalization**: 20% higher zero-shot transfer success rates compared to HER and JaxGCRL.  
3. **Interpretable Representations**: Latent space visualizations will reveal clusters corresponding to molecular properties (e.g., solubility) and robotic subgoals (e.g., gripper positioning).  
4. **Context-Aware Subgoal Inference**: The SSL module will identify valid subgoals in 85% of cases, validated via human evaluation in robotic tasks.  

**Impact**  
- **Theoretical**: Establishes a principled connection between contrastive SSL and GCRL, formalizing how metric-shared representations enable compositional generalization.  
- **Practical**: Reduces reliance on reward engineering in domains like molecular design, where handcrafted rewards are infeasible.  
- **Societal**: Accelerates deployment of adaptive RL agents in precision medicine (e.g., drug discovery) and assistive robotics, reducing development costs.

**Conclusion**  
This proposal addresses GCRL’s critical challenges through a novel integration of hierarchical contrastive learning and dynamic goal relabeling. By bridging SSL with GCRL, the framework advances both theoretical understanding and practical applicability, paving the way for more adaptable and interpretable AI systems.
