1. Title  
“Self-Supervised Contrastive Goal Representations for Enhanced Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning”  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling agents to solve a broad set of tasks by conditioning policies on arbitrary goals rather than hand-designed reward functions. Unlike standard RL, GCRL allows users to specify a desired outcome in the form of a goal observation—e.g., a target robot pose or a target molecular configuration—thereby sidestepping the need for reward engineering. However, GCRL struggles in high-dimensional or sparse-reward environments. Two core challenges are (i) sample inefficiency caused by sparse feedback and (ii) poor generalization due to weak goal–state representations.  

Recent work in self-supervised learning, contrastive abstraction, and hierarchical attention has demonstrated the power of representation learning to capture relational structures in sequential data [Patil et al., 2024; White et al., 2023; Black et al., 2023]. In parallel, advances in GCRL toolkits such as JaxGCRL [Bortkiewicz et al., 2024] have accelerated experimentation, yet the underlying algorithms still frequently ignore the rich connections between goals and states. We propose to bridge these two lines of work by integrating a self-supervised goal-state representation module with a goal-conditioned actor-critic algorithm.  

Research Objectives  
1. Develop a **self-supervised contrastive learning module** that produces goal–state embeddings capturing both temporal proximity and abstract relational structure across tasks.  
2. Integrate these embeddings into a GCRL framework (e.g., Soft Actor-Critic, SAC), enabling both dynamic goal relabeling and representation-driven exploration.  
3. Theoretically analyze how the proposed context-aware contrastive loss promotes abstraction of subgoals and policy reuse across tasks.  
4. Empirically validate the method on (a) sparse-reward continuous-control benchmarks (Meta-World) and (b) discrete molecular generation tasks with action spaces corresponding to bond additions.  

Significance  
By distilling symbolic or high-level task structure into a continuous embedding space, our approach promises to: (i) drastically reduce sample complexity in sparse settings, (ii) improve compositional generalization to novel goals, and (iii) produce interpretable latent spaces that facilitate causal reasoning about goal achievement. Such advances will expand the reach of GCRL into domains where reward design is impractical, including molecular discovery, precision medicine, and instruction-following robots.  

3. Methodology  
Our proposed framework consists of two coupled learning stages: (A) Self-Supervised Goal Representation Learning and (B) Goal-Conditioned Policy Learning. Below we describe each stage in detail, including data collection, algorithms, loss functions, and experimental design.  

3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
We will collect experience trajectories $\tau = \{(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})\}_{t=0}^{T-1}$ from an initial exploratory policy (e.g., random or an off-the-shelf GCRL baseline). These trajectories span multiple tasks/environments. From each trajectory, we extract:  
• Observations (states) $s_t\in\mathcal{S}$.  
• Goals $g\in\mathcal{G}$, which may be final states of successful episodes or user-provided demonstration states.  
• Positive pairs $\mathcal{P}^+ = \{(h_i, h_j)\}$, where $h_i,h_j$ co-occur in successful trajectories (possibly separated in time).  
• Negative pairs $\mathcal{P}^- = \{(h_i, h_k)\}$, where $h_k$ is drawn from a different trajectory or a distant temporal context.  

We partition the data into a training set (80%) and validation set (20%) to avoid overfitting the representation module.  

3.2 Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning Module  
Architecture  
We employ a **hierarchical attention encoder** $f_\phi:\mathcal{H}\to\mathbb{R}^d$ to embed history elements $h\in\{s_t,g\}$. Concretely:  
1. A low-level CNN or MLP maps raw states/goals to feature vectors.  
2. A multi-head temporal attention layer aggregates context across windows of length $L$.  
3. A global attention layer pools over subwindows to yield a final representation $z = f_\phi(h)\in\mathbb{R}^d$.  

Contrastive Loss  
We introduce a **context-aware contrastive loss** that aligns representations of temporally or semantically related pairs while repelling unrelated pairs. For a batch of $N$ anchor embeddings $\{z_i\}$, positive embeddings $\{z_i^+\}$, and $M$ negatives $\{z_{i,j}^-\}$, the loss is:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{contrast}} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \log \frac{\exp(\mathrm{sim}(z_i, z_i^+)/\tau)}{\exp(\mathrm{sim}(z_i, z_i^+)/\tau) + \sum_{j=1}^M \exp(\mathrm{sim}(z_i, z_{i,j}^-)/\tau)}
$$  
where $\mathrm{sim}(u,v)=u^\top v/\|u\|\|v\|$ is cosine similarity and $\tau$ is a temperature hyperparameter.  

Context-Aware Weighting  
To emphasize long-horizon relationships, we weight each positive pair by a temporal discount factor $\gamma_c^{|\Delta t|}$, where $\Delta t$ is the time difference in the original trajectory:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CA}} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \gamma_c^{|\Delta t_i|}\log\frac{\exp(\mathrm{sim}(z_i,z_i^+)/\tau)}{\exp(\mathrm{sim}(z_i,z_i^+)/\tau)+\sum_j\exp(\mathrm{sim}(z_i,z_{i,j}^-)/\tau)}.
$$  
By adjusting $\gamma_c<1$, we encourage the encoder to align distant but causally related states/goals.  

Optimization  
We optimize $\phi$ by minimizing $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CA}}$ using Adam with learning rate $\eta_r$. Early stopping is based on validation contrastive accuracy.  

3.3 Goal-Conditioned Policy Learning  
Algorithm  
We integrate the learned encoder into a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [Haarnoja et al., 2018] framework. Let $z_g=f_\phi(g)$ denote the goal embedding and $z_s=f_\phi(s)$ the state embedding. We define:  
• Policy $\pi_\theta(a\mid z_s, z_g)$  
• Q-functions $Q_{\psi_1}, Q_{\psi_2}(z_s, z_g, a)$  
• Value function $V_\eta(z_s, z_g)$  

The actor and critic networks take as input the concatenated embedding $[z_s; z_g]\in\mathbb{R}^{2d}$.  

Relabeling with Representation Distance  
During replay, we dynamically relabel transitions $(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1},g)$ by sampling alternative goals $\tilde g$ from the replay buffer with probability proportional to $\exp(-\|z_{s_{t+k}}-z_{\tilde g}\|)$, encouraging the agent to learn reaching close goals under the representation.  

Joint Loss  
The overall training objective alternates between:  
1. **Policy and critic update** minimizing  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{Q} = \mathbb{E}_{(s,g,a,s')}\Big[\big(Q_\psi(z_s, z_g,a)-y\big)^2\Big],\quad y = r + \gamma\,V_\eta(z_{s'},z_g),
$$  
and  
$$
\mathcal{L}_\pi = \mathbb{E}_{z_s,z_g}\Big[\alpha\log\pi_\theta(a\mid z_s,z_g) - Q_\psi(z_s,z_g,a)\Big],
$$  
with temperature $\alpha$.  
2. **Value update** minimizing  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{V} = \mathbb{E}_{z_s,z_g}\Big[\tfrac12\big(V_\eta(z_s,z_g)-\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi_\theta}Q_\psi+\alpha\log\pi_\theta\big)^2\Big].
$$  

We alternate these updates with occasional fine-tuning of the encoder $\phi$ on new experiences to adapt representations.  

3.4 Experimental Design  
Benchmarks  
1. **Meta-World** (sparse-reward continuous control)  
2. **3D Molecular Graph Generation** (discrete bond addition actions)  

Baselines  
• Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) with SAC  
• JaxGCRL (contrastive GCRL baseline)  
• Self-Supervised Goal Representation (Doe et al., 2023)  
• Contrastive Abstraction (Patil et al., 2024)  

Metrics  
• **Sample Efficiency**: episodes to reach 80% success rate  
• **Success Rate**: fraction of episodes achieving the goal  
• **Return**: cumulative undiscounted reward  
• **Embedding Quality**: silhouette score and cluster purity on goal categories  
• **Generalization**: performance on held-out goals and interpolation/extrapolation tasks  

Ablations  
1. Without context-aware weighting ($\gamma_c=1$).  
2. Without dynamic relabeling.  
3. Joint vs. sequential training of encoder and policy.  

Hyperparameters  
We will sweep over embedding dimension $d\in\{32,64,128\}$, contrastive batch size $N\in\{128,256\}$, temperature $\tau\in\{0.05,0.1\}$, relabel probability $p\in\{0.2,0.5\}$, and learning rates $\eta_r,\eta_\theta,\eta_\psi\in\{3e^{-4},1e^{-4}\}$.  

Compute  
All experiments will run on NVIDIA A100 GPUs with vectorized environment simulators. We expect each Meta-World run to complete in ~12 hours, and molecular generation in ~24 hours.  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate that our self-supervised contrastive goal representation module will significantly accelerate policy learning in sparse-reward tasks by providing informative shaping through learned embeddings. Concretely, we expect:  
• A **2–3×** reduction in sample complexity compared to HER and JaxGCRL on Meta-World benchmarks.  
• A **10–20%** improvement in final success rates on held-out goals, demonstrating better generalization.  
• Embedding spaces that cluster naturally by goal categories, as measured by silhouette scores ≥0.6, enabling interpretable subgoal extraction.  

Beyond empirical gains, our context-aware contrastive loss is theoretically grounded: by weighting long-horizon positive pairs, we encourage the encoder to capture abstract subgoals, facilitating policy transfer across tasks. This interpretable latent structure can be leveraged for causal reasoning—for example, diagnosing which subgoal transitions most influence performance.  

Impact  
• **Robotics**: Rapid adaptation to novel manipulation goals without reward redesign.  
• **Molecular Design**: Guiding discrete generation with goal embeddings learned from past syntheses, improving yield predictions.  
• **Precision Medicine**: Encoding patient treatment objectives as goals, enabling personalized therapy planning where reward functions are elusive.  

In sum, our research will chart a path for next-generation GCRL algorithms that seamlessly integrate representation learning, self-supervision, and dynamic goal management—paving the way for broader real-world deployment of goal-conditioned agents.
