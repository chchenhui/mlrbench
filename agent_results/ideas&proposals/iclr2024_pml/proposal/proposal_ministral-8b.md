# Regulation-Sensitive Dynamic Differential Privacy for Federated Learning

## Introduction

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has led to the development of sophisticated models that rely on large-scale datasets. However, the use of such data must be responsible, transparent, and compliant with privacy regulations such as GDPR and DMA. This research proposal aims to address the challenge of balancing privacy and utility in federated learning (FL) by introducing a novel framework that aligns differential privacy (DP) with regulatory sensitivity. The proposed framework dynamically allocates privacy budgets based on the sensitivity of individual data features, thereby enhancing model performance while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

### Research Objectives

1. **Automated Feature Sensitivity Classification**: Develop a method to automatically classify features based on their regulatory sensitivity using metadata and lightweight natural language processing (NLP) classifiers.
2. **Dynamic Privacy Budget Allocation**: Create an algorithm that dynamically allocates privacy budgets per feature or per group based on the sensitivity scores and a global privacy target.
3. **Secure Aggregation**: Implement a secure aggregator that enforces the tailored privacy budgets and produces an immutable audit log for each training round.
4. **Evaluation and Compliance**: Evaluate the proposed framework on healthcare and financial datasets, demonstrating improved utility and compliance with GDPR’s data-minimization and accountability clauses.

### Significance

The proposed research is significant for several reasons:
1. **Enhanced Privacy Utility Trade-off**: By dynamically allocating privacy budgets, the framework aims to maximize model performance while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: The framework aligns with GDPR and other regulations by classifying data fields by risk level, thereby ensuring compliance with data protection laws.
3. **Practical Adoption**: The proposed approach drives practical adoption of privacy-preserving federated learning by balancing legal requirements, transparency, and model accuracy.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed research design involves several key components:

1. **Feature Sensitivity Classification**: Automatically classify features based on their regulatory sensitivity using metadata and lightweight NLP classifiers.
2. **Dynamic Privacy Budget Allocation**: Allocate privacy budgets dynamically based on the sensitivity scores and a global privacy target.
3. **Secure Aggregation**: Enforce the tailored privacy budgets and produce an immutable audit log for each training round.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the framework on healthcare and financial datasets, demonstrating improved utility and compliance with GDPR.

### Data Collection

For the evaluation, we will use healthcare and financial datasets that are sensitive and subject to privacy regulations. These datasets will include:
- **Healthcare Dataset**: Contains medical records and patient information.
- **Financial Dataset**: Includes transaction records and customer data.

### Algorithmic Steps

#### Feature Sensitivity Classification

1. **Metadata Extraction**: Extract metadata from the dataset to identify sensitive features (e.g., personal identifiers, health conditions).
2. **NLP Classification**: Use lightweight NLP classifiers to further classify features based on their regulatory sensitivity.

#### Dynamic Privacy Budget Allocation

1. **Sensitivity Scoring**: Assign sensitivity scores to each feature based on the metadata and NLP classification results.
2. **Budget Allocation**: Dynamically allocate privacy budgets per feature or per group based on the sensitivity scores and a global privacy target.

#### Secure Aggregation

1. **Noise Injection**: Inject noise into the model updates based on the tailored privacy budgets.
2. **Aggregation**: Aggregate the noisy updates securely using a secure aggregator.
3. **Audit Log**: Generate an immutable audit log for each training round to enable third-party verification.

### Mathematical Formulation

#### Sensitivity Scoring

Let \( S \) be the set of features in the dataset, and \( s_i \) be the sensitivity score of feature \( i \). The sensitivity score \( s_i \) can be calculated as:

\[ s_i = f(m_i, n_i) \]

where \( m_i \) is the metadata score and \( n_i \) is the NLP score for feature \( i \).

#### Privacy Budget Allocation

Let \( \epsilon \) be the global privacy target, and \( \epsilon_i \) be the privacy budget for feature \( i \). The privacy budget allocation can be formulated as:

\[ \epsilon_i = \frac{s_i}{\sum_{j \in S} s_j} \cdot \epsilon \]

#### Noise Injection

The noise \( \eta_i \) injected into the model update for feature \( i \) can be calculated as:

\[ \eta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_i^2) \]

where \( \sigma_i^2 = \frac{\epsilon_i^2}{2} \).

### Experimental Design

#### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Utility Gain**: Measure the improvement in model performance (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) compared to uniform DP.
2. **Privacy Compliance**: Assess compliance with GDPR’s data-minimization and accountability clauses.
3. **Communication Cost**: Evaluate the impact on communication costs due to noise injection.

### Validation

The proposed framework will be validated through:
1. **Simulations**: Conduct simulations on healthcare and financial datasets to evaluate the utility gain and privacy compliance.
2. **Real-world Testing**: Perform real-world testing on a small-scale federated learning system to assess the practicality and performance of the framework.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Improved Utility**: Demonstrate up to 30% utility gain versus uniform DP under equal total privacy cost.
2. **Compliance with Regulations**: Show end-to-end compliance with GDPR’s data-minimization and accountability clauses.
3. **Practical Adoption**: Develop a framework that drives practical adoption of privacy-preserving federated learning by balancing legal requirements, transparency, and model accuracy.

### Impact

1. **Academic Contribution**: Contribute to the academic literature on privacy-preserving federated learning by introducing a novel framework that aligns differential privacy with regulatory sensitivity.
2. **Industry Impact**: Provide industry practitioners with a practical approach to privacy-preserving federated learning, enhancing the adoption of privacy-preserving techniques in real-world applications.
3. **Regulatory Alignment**: Align federated learning practices with evolving data protection regulations, ensuring compliance and building trust in privacy-preserving machine learning systems.

## Conclusion

This research proposal outlines a novel approach to privacy-preserving federated learning that dynamically allocates privacy budgets based on regulatory sensitivity. By automating feature sensitivity classification, dynamically allocating privacy budgets, and implementing secure aggregation with audit logging, the proposed framework aims to enhance model performance while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. The expected outcomes and impact of this research include significant improvements in utility, regulatory compliance, and practical adoption of privacy-preserving federated learning techniques.
