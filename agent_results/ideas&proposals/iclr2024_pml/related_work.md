4. **Title**: Differentially Private Federated Learning With Time-Adaptive Privacy Spending (arXiv:2502.18706)
   - **Authors**: Shahrzad Kiani, Nupur Kulkarni, Adam Dziedzic, Stark Draper, Franziska Boenisch
   - **Summary**: This paper proposes a time-adaptive differential privacy framework for federated learning, allowing clients to allocate their privacy budgets non-uniformly across training rounds.

**2. Key Challenges**

1. **Balancing Privacy and Utility**: Implementing differential privacy in federated learning often leads to a trade-off between data privacy and model performance. Achieving an optimal balance remains a significant challenge.

2. **Data Heterogeneity**: Federated learning systems must handle data that is non-i.i.d. and varies across clients, complicating the application of uniform privacy mechanisms and affecting model convergence.

3. **Communication Constraints**: Ensuring privacy while maintaining efficient communication between clients and servers is challenging, especially when adding noise to model updates increases the data size.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Aligning federated learning practices with diverse and evolving data protection regulations like GDPR requires dynamic and adaptable privacy mechanisms.

5. **Adaptive Privacy Budget Allocation**: Developing methods to allocate privacy budgets dynamically across features and training rounds to optimize both privacy and utility is a complex task.
