## **1. Title: Scalable Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification for Scientific Foundation Models with Domain-Knowledge Priors**

## **2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
The landscape of scientific discovery is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Traditional scientific methodologies, while robust, are increasingly complemented and accelerated by data-driven approaches (Task Description). Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on vast datasets and demonstrating remarkable adaptability across diverse tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), represent a paradigm shift in AI (Task Description). Examples like GPT-4 and CLIP showcase the power of large-scale pre-training followed by fine-tuning for specific applications.

The confluence of AI-for-Science and FMs presents unprecedented opportunities (Task Description). By leveraging the representational power and potential for multi-modal reasoning inherent in FMs, researchers can tackle complex scientific problems, from modeling intricate physical phenomena to accelerating drug discovery and materials science. These "Scientific Foundation Models" (SciFMs) promise to serve as versatile platforms, adaptable to various scientific domains and tasks, potentially outperforming specialized, smaller-scale models (Task Description: Progress - Reusability, Performance). However, transitioning FMs from general domains like text and images to the rigorous demands of scientific inquiry introduces unique challenges (Task Description: Challenges).

One of the most critical challenges lies in ensuring the reliability and trustworthiness of SciFM predictions. Scientific progress relies not only on predictions but also on understanding their confidence and limitations. Unlike many applications in NLP or CV, errors in scientific domains—such as predicting molecular interactions for drug design, forecasting climate change impacts, or analyzing high-energy physics data—can have profound and costly consequences. Standard FMs, while powerful predictors, often lack robust mechanisms for quantifying the uncertainty associated with their outputs. They may produce highly confident predictions even when extrapolating far beyond their training data or encountering novel scientific phenomena, potentially leading to "hallucinations" or misalignment with established scientific facts (Task Description: Challenges - Alignment, Uncertainty). This gap necessitates the development of methods specifically designed to quantify uncertainty within the context of large-scale SciFMs.

**2.2 Problem Statement**
While foundation models offer transformative potential for scientific discovery, their direct application is hindered by a critical lack of reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ). Standard deterministic FMs provide point estimates without conveying the confidence in those predictions. Existing UQ methods developed for smaller models or different domains may not scale effectively to the massive size and complexity of SciFMs, nor adequately incorporate the rich domain knowledge inherent in scientific disciplines. This deficiency poses a significant barrier to the adoption and trustworthy deployment of SciFMs in high-stakes scientific research, where understanding the bounds of model reliability is paramount for decision-making, experimental design, and validating new scientific hypotheses. Failure to address this challenge risks undermining the potential benefits of SciFMs by fostering mistrust or leading to erroneous scientific conclusions.

**2.3 Proposed Research: Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification for SciFMs**
To address this critical gap, we propose the development of a comprehensive Bayesian framework tailored for uncertainty quantification in Scientific Foundation Models (SciFMs). The core idea is to leverage Bayesian inference techniques, specifically adapted for scalability, to capture model uncertainty (epistemic uncertainty) and potentially data uncertainty (aleatoric uncertainty) within large-scale SciFMs. Crucially, this framework will explicitly incorporate domain-specific scientific knowledge (e.g., physical laws, constraints, symmetries) as informative Bayesian priors. This integration aims to produce not only predictions but also principled, calibrated uncertainty estimates (e.g., credible intervals) that reflect both the model's inherent uncertainty and its consistency with known scientific principles.

**2.4 Research Objectives**
The primary goal of this research is to develop, implement, and validate a scalable and scientifically-informed Bayesian UQ framework for SciFMs. This overarching goal is broken down into the following specific objectives:

1.  **Develop Scalable Bayesian Inference Techniques for SciFMs:** Adapt and implement variational inference (VI) methods capable of handling the computational demands (memory, processing time) of training large-scale Bayesian SciFMs (addressing Literature Review Challenge 1; see Psaros et al., 2022; White & Green, 2023).
2.  **Integrate Domain-Specific Scientific Knowledge as Bayesian Priors:** Formulate methodologies for encoding scientific laws, constraints, conservation principles, or symmetries as informative priors within the Bayesian framework to enhance UQ reliability and alignment with scientific facts (addressing Task Description Challenge: Alignment; Literature Review Challenge 2; informed by Johnson & Williams, 2023).
3.  **Design and Validate Science-Specific Calibration Metrics:** Develop novel metrics to assess the quality and calibration of uncertainty estimates generated by SciFMs, tailored to the requirements and tolerance levels of scientific applications (addressing Literature Review Challenge 3; building on Davis & Brown, 2024).
4.  **Implement Uncertainty Decomposition and Visualization Tools:** Develop methods to disentangle different sources of uncertainty (epistemic vs. aleatoric where applicable) and create intuitive visualization tools to effectively communicate SciFM uncertainty estimates to domain scientists (addressing Literature Review Challenge 4; informed by Lee & Kim, 2024).
5.  **Benchmark the Framework Across Diverse Scientific Domains:** Evaluate the performance, scalability, and UQ quality of the proposed framework on representative SciFMs applied to problems in multiple scientific fields (e.g., Computational Science, Materials Science, Biomedicine) against relevant baselines (informed by Black & Gray, 2024).

**2.5 Significance**
This research directly addresses a critical bottleneck hindering the reliable application of foundation models in science. By providing a robust framework for UQ, this work will:

*   **Enhance Trust and Reliability:** Enable scientists to critically assess the confidence of SciFM predictions, fostering greater trust and facilitating responsible adoption in research workflows.
*   **Improve Scientific Decision-Making:** Provide principled uncertainty estimates to guide experimental design, resource allocation, and interpretation of results derived from SciFMs.
*   **Accelerate Scientific Discovery:** Help identify regions where models are uncertain, potentially highlighting areas ripe for further investigation, new experiments, or data acquisition (Task Description: Opportunities - Accelerate discovery).
*   **Promote Alignment with Scientific Principles:** Explicitly incorporating domain knowledge as priors encourages SciFMs to produce outputs consistent with established scientific facts, mitigating hallucination (Task Description: Challenges - Alignment).
*   **Advance the Field of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML):** Contribute novel scalable Bayesian methods, calibration techniques, and a deeper understanding of UQ challenges specific to large-scale SciFMs, bridging the gap between powerful AI tools and rigorous scientific practice.

## **3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework**
The proposed research centers on developing a Bayesian framework for SciFMs. Instead of learning a single set of optimal weights $\theta$ for a foundation model $f_\theta(x)$, we aim to infer a posterior distribution over the weights $p(\theta | D)$, where $D = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ is the training data (potentially vast and multi-modal). Given this posterior, the predictive distribution for a new input $x^*$ incorporates uncertainty:
$$ p(y^* | x^*, D) = \int p(y^* | x^*, \theta) p(\theta | D) d\theta $$
This predictive distribution allows us to derive point estimates (e.g., the mean) and uncertainty estimates (e.g., variance or credible intervals).

**3.2 Data Collection and Preparation**
This research will leverage existing large-scale scientific datasets suitable for training or fine-tuning foundation models. Depending on the chosen scientific domains for benchmarking (Objective 5), this may include:
*   **Biomedicine:** Protein structure databases (e.g., PDB), genomics sequence datasets (e.g., GenBank), molecular property datasets (e.g., QM9, ZINC).
*   **Computational Science:** Simulation data from solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) (e.g., fluid dynamics, weather forecasting), time-series data from physical systems.
*   **Materials Science:** Materials property databases (e.g., Materials Project), simulation data of molecular dynamics or density functional theory (DFT).
*   **Earth Science:** Satellite imagery, climate model outputs, geological survey data.

Data preprocessing will involve standardizing formats, handling missing values, and potentially applying domain-specific augmentations. For evaluating UQ, we will specifically curate or identify subsets of data representing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples or regions where high uncertainty is expected based on scientific principles.

**3.3 Bayesian SciFM Formulation and Scalable Inference**
Given the scale of FMs, exact Bayesian inference is intractable. We will primarily focus on **Variational Inference (VI)** (Jordan et al., 1999; Blei et al., 2017) due to its computational efficiency and scalability (White & Green, 2023).

*   **Variational Approximation:** We approximate the true posterior $p(\theta | D)$ with a simpler, tractable distribution $q_\phi(\theta)$, parameterized by $\phi$. This is typically chosen as a factorized Gaussian distribution (Mean-Field VI) or a more structured distribution if needed.
*   **Objective Function:** The parameters $\phi$ are optimized by maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{ELBO}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\theta)}[\log p(D|\theta)] - D_{KL}(q_\phi(\theta) || p(\theta)) $$
    where $p(D|\theta) = \prod_i p(y_i | x_i, \theta)$ is the likelihood of the data given the model parameters, $p(\theta)$ is the prior distribution over the parameters, and $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximate posterior and the prior.
*   **Scalability Techniques:** To handle large models and datasets, we will employ:
    *   **Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI):** Using mini-batches of data to compute noisy gradients of the ELBO.
    *   **Reparameterization Trick:** (Kingma & Welling, 2013) To allow backpropagation through the sampling process.
    *   **Local Reparameterization / Flipout:** (Kingma et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2018) To reduce the variance of gradient estimates, particularly important for large layers.
    *   **Efficient Architectures:** Investigating techniques like Bayesian variants of attention mechanisms or parameter-efficient Bayesian fine-tuning (similar to adapters or LoRA, but in a Bayesian context) might be explored if full Bayesian inference on all parameters remains prohibitive.

We will also consider and potentially compare VI with other scalable UQ approaches like Deep Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) and Monte Carlo Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) as baselines, benchmarking their UQ quality and computational trade-offs (Black & Gray, 2024).

**3.4 Incorporating Scientific Priors (Objective 2)**
This is a key novelty. We will move beyond standard uninformative priors (e.g., isotropic Gaussian $p(\theta) = \mathcal{N}(0, I)$) to incorporate domain knowledge (Johnson & Williams, 2023). Methods include:

*   **Priors on Output Constraints:** If a scientific law dictates a property of the output $y$ (e.g., conservation of energy, $g(y) = 0$), we can incorporate this. One approach is to add a penalty term to the ELBO that encourages predictions satisfying the constraint, potentially weighted by the model's confidence.
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{Constraint} = \lambda \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\theta)} \mathbb{E}_{p(x)} [ L_{constraint}(f_\theta(x)) ] $$
    where $L_{constraint}$ penalizes violations of $g(y)=0$.
*   **Structured Priors on Weights:** If specific model components relate to known physical processes or symmetries, we can design priors $p(\theta)$ that reflect this structure. For instance, enforcing permutation invariance/equivariance through prior specification on specific weight groups.
*   **Priors Informed by Simplified Models:** Using outputs or parameter distributions from established, simpler scientific models (e.g., analytical solutions, reduced-order models) to inform the prior $p(\theta)$ for the complex SciFM.

The challenge lies in formulating these priors mathematically and ensuring they interact correctly with the VI optimization process without hindering convergence or introducing unintended biases.

**3.5 Uncertainty Decomposition and Calibration (Objectives 3 & 4)**
*   **Decomposition:** The Bayesian framework naturally allows for capturing epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty due to limited knowledge of the model parameters $\theta$). In some cases (e.g., by predicting parameters of the output distribution, like the variance $\sigma^2$ in $p(y|x, \theta) = \mathcal{N}(f_\theta(x), \sigma^2_\theta(x))$ ), we can also capture aleatoric uncertainty (inherent noise or variability in the data generating process) (Guo et al., 2023; Psaros et al., 2022). We will investigate methods to estimate and potentially disentangle these sources within the SciFM context.
*   **Calibration Metrics:** Standard metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) based on binning predictions by confidence may not be sufficient for scientific applications where specific error tolerances or physical constraints matter. We propose developing or adapting metrics such as:
    *   **Interval Calibration:** Assessing whether $p\%$ credible intervals contain the true value $p\%$ of the time.
    *   **Constraint-Based Calibration:** Evaluating calibration conditional on predictions satisfying or violating known scientific constraints.
    *   **Distributional Calibration:** Comparing the full predictive distribution $p(y^* | x^*, D)$ against the distribution of true outcomes using metrics like the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). (Inspired by Davis & Brown, 2024).

**3.6 Experimental Design and Validation (Objective 5)**

*   **Datasets and Tasks:** Select 2-3 diverse scientific domains (e.g., PDE solving using Neural Operators built on FMs, molecular property prediction, materials stability classification). Use established benchmark datasets within these domains. Include both interpolation and extrapolation (OOD) regimes.
*   **Models:** Implement the proposed Bayesian UQ framework on top of representative SciFM architectures (e.g., Transformer-based models adapted for scientific data).
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  Deterministic FM (point estimates only).
    2.  Deep Ensembles applied to the FM.
    3.  MC Dropout applied to the FM.
    4.  The proposed Bayesian SciFM *without* informative scientific priors.
    5.  (If feasible) Domain-specific SciML models with established UQ methods (e.g., Gaussian Processes on smaller data, specific PDE UQ methods if applicable).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Predictive Accuracy:** RMSE, MAE (regression); Accuracy, F1-score, AUC (classification).
    *   **UQ Quality:** Calibration metrics (ECE, interval calibration, science-specific metrics developed in Obj. 3), Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), CRPS, Assessment of uncertainty intervals (width, coverage), performance on OOD detection.
    *   **Computational Cost:** Training time, inference time per sample (for predictive distribution), memory footprint.
*   **Analyses:**
    *   Compare performance across baselines and the proposed method.
    *   Ablation studies: Quantify the impact of scientific priors vs. standard priors.
    *   Analyze UQ behavior in OOD scenarios.
    *   Assess scalability with increasing model size or data size.

**3.7 Visualization Tools (Objective 4)**
Develop a suite of visualization tools using libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, or specialized scientific visualization packages. These tools will aim to present:
*   Predictive distributions (histograms, density plots) alongside point estimates.
*   Credible intervals plotted against predictions or true values.
*   Uncertainty maps (for spatial or structured outputs).
*   Calibration plots (reliability diagrams).
*   Visualizations showing the influence of scientific priors on uncertainty estimates.
The design will prioritize clarity and interpretability for domain scientists (Lee & Kim, 2024).
