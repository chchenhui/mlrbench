## Title: Scientific Foundation Model Uncertainty Quantification: A Bayesian Approach

## Introduction

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the realm of science represents a transformative shift in traditional methods of scientific discovery. Foundation models, trained on vast and diverse datasets, have demonstrated robust adaptability across various tasks in computer vision and natural language processing. However, their application in scientific domains presents unique challenges and opportunities. One critical aspect of this integration is the need for reliable uncertainty quantification, which is essential for high-stakes scientific applications where model predictions must be rigorously validated.

Current foundation models excel at producing answers but often fail to provide reliable uncertainty estimates. This lack of uncertainty quantification can lead to misleading conclusions and undermine the trustworthiness of scientific findings. To address this, we propose developing a Bayesian framework specifically designed for quantifying uncertainty in scientific foundation models. This framework combines Bayesian neural networks with domain-specific scientific constraints to generate credible intervals for model predictions. The methodology involves implementing variational inference techniques that scale to large foundation models, incorporating scientific laws and domain knowledge as Bayesian priors, developing calibration metrics specifically for scientific applications, and creating uncertainty visualization tools that scientists without ML expertise can interpret.

The research aims to bridge the gap between the powerful capabilities of foundation models and the rigorous uncertainty quantification required in scientific discovery. The proposed framework will provide reliable uncertainty quantification across multiple scientific domains, enabling researchers to appropriately weight model predictions in their work and identify areas where models require improvement. This research is poised to significantly enhance the reliability and credibility of AI-driven scientific discoveries.

The research design involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect scientific datasets from various domains, including astrophysics, biomedicine, computational science, earth science, materials science, quantum mechanics, and small molecules. Ensure that the datasets are diverse and representative of the scientific problems to be addressed.

2. **Model Training**: Train foundation models on the collected scientific datasets. Use state-of-the-art architectures and training strategies to ensure that the models are robust and capable of handling the complexity of scientific data.

3. **Uncertainty Quantification Framework**: Develop a Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification. The framework will incorporate the following components:

   - **Variational Inference**: Implement variational inference techniques that scale to large foundation models. These techniques will enable efficient computation of posterior distributions and credible intervals.

   - **Domain-Specific Priors**: Incorporate scientific laws and domain knowledge as Bayesian priors. This will help to ensure that the model predictions are aligned with established scientific facts and reduce the risk of hallucinations.

   - **Calibration Metrics**: Develop calibration metrics specifically for scientific applications. These metrics will assess the reliability of uncertainty estimates and ensure that predicted confidence intervals accurately reflect the true uncertainty.

   - **Uncertainty Visualization**: Create visualization tools that effectively communicate uncertainty to scientists without ML expertise. These tools will include interactive plots and dashboards that display credible intervals, sensitivity analyses, and uncertainty decompositions.

4. **Validation and Evaluation**: Validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments and comparisons with existing uncertainty quantification methods. Evaluate the performance of the framework using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and calibration accuracy. Additionally, conduct case studies in various scientific domains to demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the framework.

### Algorithmic Steps and Mathematical Formulas

#### Variational Inference

Variational inference is a technique for approximating the posterior distribution of a probabilistic model. In the context of Bayesian neural networks, variational inference involves finding a variational distribution that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the true posterior distribution. The variational distribution is typically chosen to be a simple distribution, such as a Gaussian distribution, to simplify computations.

The variational inference objective is to minimize the following KL divergence:

$$ \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})} [\log p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}) + \log p(\mathbf{z}) - \log q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})] $$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the observed data, $\mathbf{z}$ are the latent variables, $p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})$ is the likelihood, and $p(\mathbf{z})$ is the prior. The variational distribution $q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})$ is parameterized by $\theta$.

#### Incorporating Domain-Specific Priors

To incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the Bayesian framework, we use informative priors that capture scientific laws and domain-specific constraints. These priors are incorporated into the prior distribution $p(\mathbf{z})$ in the variational inference objective:

$$ p(\mathbf{z}) = p(\mathbf{z}|\text{scientific laws}) $$

where $p(\mathbf{z}|\text{scientific laws})$ represents the prior distribution conditioned on scientific laws and domain knowledge.

#### Calibration Metrics

Calibration metrics assess the reliability of uncertainty estimates by comparing the predicted confidence intervals with the true uncertainty. One commonly used calibration metric is the Expected Calibration Error (ECE), which measures the average difference between the predicted confidence and the actual frequency of correct predictions within different confidence intervals. The ECE is defined as:

$$ \text{ECE} = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} \left| \frac{1}{N_b} \sum_{i \in B_b} \mathbf{1}(y_i = 1) - \frac{1}{N_b} \sum_{i \in B_b} \mathbf{1}(y_i = 0) \right| $$

where $B$ is the number of confidence intervals, $N_b$ is the number of samples in confidence interval $b$, and $\mathbf{1}(y_i = 1)$ is an indicator function that equals 1 if the sample $i$ is correctly predicted and 0 otherwise.

#### Uncertainty Visualization

Uncertainty visualization tools are designed to help scientists interpret uncertainty estimates from machine learning models. These tools include interactive plots and dashboards that display credible intervals, sensitivity analyses, and uncertainty decompositions. For example, a credible interval plot can show the range of model predictions with a certain level of confidence, allowing scientists to assess the reliability of the predictions.

### Experimental Design

To validate the proposed framework, we will conduct the following experiments:

1. **Benchmarking**: Compare the performance of the Bayesian framework with existing uncertainty quantification methods on benchmark scientific datasets. Evaluate the performance using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and calibration accuracy.

2. **Case Studies**: Conduct case studies in various scientific domains, including astrophysics, biomedicine, computational science, earth science, materials science, quantum mechanics, and small molecules. Evaluate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the framework in these domains.

3. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Perform sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the uncertainty estimates to different model architectures, training strategies, and data characteristics. This will help to identify the key factors that influence the reliability of uncertainty quantification.

4. **User Study**: Conduct a user study with domain experts to evaluate the usability and interpretability of the uncertainty visualization tools. Gather feedback from the experts to identify areas for improvement and refine the tools accordingly.
