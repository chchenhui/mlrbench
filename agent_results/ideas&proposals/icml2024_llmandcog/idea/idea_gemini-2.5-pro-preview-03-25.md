**Title:** Cognitively Grounded LLM Evaluation via Adaptive Adversarial Benchmarking

**Motivation:** Existing benchmarks often test LLMs on static datasets, failing to capture the dynamic and adaptive nature of human cognition, particularly in reasoning and problem-solving. This makes it difficult to rigorously assess whether LLMs' successes stem from genuine cognitive abilities or pattern matching on training data distributions.

**Main Idea:** We propose developing an adaptive adversarial benchmarking framework grounded in cognitive science principles. This framework dynamically generates challenging reasoning and planning problems based on an LLM's ongoing performance, specifically targeting identified weaknesses (e.g., compositional generalization, counterfactual reasoning). The system would comprise two interacting LLMs: a "Proposer" generating novel problems based on cognitive templates and difficulty metrics, and the "Evaluator" (the LLM under test). Performance analysis would focus not just on accuracy but also on failure patterns, comparing them to human cognitive biases and limitations. This approach allows for more rigorous, scalable, and cognitively relevant evaluation, pushing LLMs beyond dataset-specific heuristics.
