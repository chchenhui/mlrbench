**Title**: Dynamic Cognitive Benchmarking for LLMs: Bridging the Gap Between AI and Human Cognitive Evaluation  

**Motivation**: Current benchmarks for assessing cognitive abilities in LLMs (e.g., reasoning, planning) often rely on static, narrow tasks that fail to capture the complexity and adaptability of human cognition. This limits our understanding of LLMs' *true* cognitive potential and hinders progress toward human-like intelligence.  

**Main Idea**: Develop a benchmark framework inspired by human cognitive assessment protocols (e.g., neuropsychological tests) to evaluate LLMs on dynamic, open-ended scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning, theory of mind, and real-time adaptation. For example, design tasks where LLMs must infer unstated goals in a narrative, revise plans when faced with unexpected constraints, or explain their reasoning process iteratively. Metrics would prioritize *process* (e.g., coherence of intermediate steps, error recovery) over outcome accuracy alone. The benchmark would integrate transfer learning challenges to assess generalization across domains. Collaborations with cognitive scientists would ensure alignment with human cognitive principles. Expected outcomes include a taxonomy of LLM cognitive strengths/weaknesses and actionable insights for model architecture improvements (e.g., hybrid neurosymbolic modules). This work could redefine how we measure and advance machine intelligence toward more robust, human-aligned cognition.
