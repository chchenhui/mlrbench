# Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) Screening AI

## Motivation
Early identification of developmental delays and disorders in children is crucial, as timely intervention can significantly improve outcomes. However, comprehensive screening programs are limited by healthcare resource constraints, especially in low-resource settings. Current screening tools often require trained professionals and are not continuously available to families. This research aims to develop an AI solution that democratizes access to early childhood developmental screening, enabling timely interventions for children worldwide regardless of geographical or economic barriers.

## Main Idea
We propose developing an AI-based mobile application that uses multimodal inputs (video, audio, and parental questionnaires) to screen for developmental delays in children aged 0-5 years. The system will utilize computer vision to analyze motor milestones, speech recognition to assess language development, and natural language processing to interpret parental concerns. The AI will be trained on diverse global datasets to ensure cultural sensitivity and will provide three levels of output: immediate developmental guidance for parents, risk stratification for healthcare prioritization, and longitudinal developmental tracking. The system will be designed with privacy-by-design principles and will include explainable AI elements to build trust with parents and healthcare providers. Initial deployment will focus on underserved regions where pediatric specialists are scarce, potentially revolutionizing early intervention by enabling continuous screening rather than point-in-time assessments.
