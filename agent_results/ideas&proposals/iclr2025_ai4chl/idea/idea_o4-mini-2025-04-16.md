Title: EmpathAI Kids: A Multi-Modal Conversational Agent for Early Detection of Childhood Anxiety

Motivation:  
Childhood anxiety often goes unrecognized until it severely impacts well-being and school performance. Traditional screenings require clinical visits and can miss subtle, day-to-day behavioral cues. An AI companion that gently assesses emotional health through natural interaction offers scalable, non-intrusive early detection—enabling timely interventions and reducing long-term psychological burden.

Main Idea:  
We propose EmpathAI Kids, a tablet-based conversational agent combining a large language model with lightweight vision and speech analyzers. During brief, gamified dialogue sessions (5–10 minutes weekly), the system unobtrusively captures:  
 • Linguistic markers (hesitations, sentiment shifts) via the LLM’s parser  
 • Vocal stress patterns via prosody analysis  
 • Facial affect through a child-safe, edge-deployed vision model  
These multi-modal features feed into a privacy-preserving classifier fine-tuned on labeled pediatric anxiety datasets. We will pilot in classrooms and pediatric clinics, validating sensitivity and specificity against standard psychological scales. Expected outcomes include >80% early-warning accuracy and positive user engagement. This tool can bridge resource gaps in low-resource settings, alert caregivers or professionals to emerging anxiety, and ultimately foster healthier childhood development.
