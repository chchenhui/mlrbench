**Title:** Developmentally-Appropriate LLM Tutors for Early Childhood Education

**Motivation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) offer immense potential for personalized education, but current models are primarily trained on adult data and lack sensitivity to the unique cognitive and linguistic development stages of young children. Adapting LLMs for safe and effective early childhood education is crucial for leveraging AI's benefits without compromising child development.

**Main Idea:** This research proposes creating LLM-based educational agents tailored for preschool and early elementary children (ages 4-7). The core idea involves fine-tuning existing LLMs using curated datasets comprising children's literature, age-appropriate educational materials, and simulated child-teacher interactions reflecting Piagetian developmental stages. We will develop methods to constrain LLM outputs for safety, pedagogical soundness (e.g., scaffolding, guided discovery), and age-appropriate language/complexity. The expected outcome is a prototype interactive tutor capable of engaging children in foundational literacy and numeracy activities, adapting its interaction style based on inferred developmental level. Evaluation will involve usability testing with children and educators, focusing on engagement, learning outcomes, and safety protocols. This work aims to provide a blueprint for truly child-centric educational AI.
