**1. Title:** **Meta-Learning Robust Solvers for Inverse Problems with Forward Model Uncertainty**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Inverse problems are fundamental challenges across numerous scientific and engineering domains, including medical imaging (e.g., MRI, CT reconstruction), geophysical exploration (e.g., seismic imaging), computational photography (e.g., deblurring, super-resolution), and non-destructive testing. These problems involve estimating latent parameters or structures ($x$) from indirect measurements ($y$), typically modeled by a forward operator ($A$) and corrupted by noise ($n$), often represented as $y = A(x) + n$. The goal is to design a solver that effectively recovers $x$ given $y$ and knowledge of $A$.

In recent years, deep learning (DL) has revolutionized the approach to solving inverse problems. Methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, and unrolled optimization networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance, often surpassing traditional regularization-based techniques in terms of reconstruction quality and speed. These DL solvers learn powerful data-driven priors directly from examples, effectively capturing complex structural information inherent in the target signals or images.

However, a critical limitation of many current DL-based solvers is their strong dependence on the precise knowledge of the forward operator $A$ and the noise model used during training. In numerous practical applications, the true forward model is subject to significant uncertainty or variation. This *model mismatch* can arise from various sources:
*   **Calibration Errors:** Imperfect calibration of measurement devices (e.g., MRI scanner gradient fields, camera point spread functions).
*   **Environmental Variability:** Changes in environmental conditions affecting the physics of the measurement process (e.g., temperature fluctuations, background interference).
*   **Model Simplifications:** Use of idealized or simplified physical models for computational tractability that neglect certain real-world effects (e.g., ignoring non-linearities, scattering effects).
*   **System Heterogeneity:** Variations across different instances of the same measurement system or patient-specific factors in medical imaging.
*   **Noise Model Inaccuracy:** Assuming simple additive Gaussian noise when the true noise might be signal-dependent, spatially correlated, or follow a different distribution (e.g., Poisson, Rician).

When the forward model used during inference ($A_{true}$) deviates from the nominal model assumed during training ($A_{train}$), the performance of DL solvers can degrade catastrophically, leading to severe artifacts, inaccurate reconstructions, and ultimately, a lack of reliability in real-world deployment. This issue directly aligns with the challenges highlighted in the Workshop on Deep Learning and Inverse Problems, particularly the need for algorithms addressing model uncertainty and partial system information to build more effective, reliable, and trustworthy solutions.

The literature review highlights recent efforts to tackle this challenge. Approaches include incorporating untrained network components to adaptively fit the forward model (Guan et al., 2024), integrating uncertainty quantification (UQ) into deep surrogate models (Wu et al., 2024), using Bayesian methods like conditional normalizing flows (Khorashadizadeh et al., 2022) or Bayesian deep gradient descent (Barbano et al., 2020) to estimate model uncertainty, and leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) (Various, 2025). While promising, these methods often focus on specific types of uncertainty or require significant computational overhead for UQ. The challenge of efficiently learning solvers that *generalize* robustly across a *distribution* of potential forward models remains pertinent.

**2.2 Research Objectives**
This research proposes a novel approach based on **meta-learning** to explicitly train inverse problem solvers for robustness against forward model uncertainty. Instead of assuming a single, fixed forward model, we aim to train a solver that can perform well across, or quickly adapt to, a range of plausible forward models encountered in practice.

The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Formulate a Meta-Learning Framework for Inverse Problems with Model Uncertainty:** Define the concept of a "task" within the meta-learning framework, where each task corresponds to solving an inverse problem instance with a specific forward operator $A_i$ sampled from a predefined distribution $p(A)$ that captures the expected model uncertainty. Design a suitable meta-objective function that promotes robustness and/or adaptability.
2.  **Design and Implement a Meta-Learned Inverse Solver:** Develop a neural network architecture (e.g., based on U-Nets, unrolled optimization, or other suitable architectures) and integrate it with a chosen meta-learning algorithm (e.g., Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) or variants). The algorithm should enable the network to learn an initialization or representation that is effective across the distribution $p(A)$.
3.  **Define and Generate Realistic Forward Model Distributions:** Specify methods for creating distributions $p(A)$ that reflect typical sources of uncertainty in relevant applications (e.g., varying blur kernels in deconvolution, imprecise sensitivity maps or k-space trajectories in MRI, different noise statistics).
4.  **Empirically Validate Robustness and Generalization:** Conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets (e.g., image deblurring, simulated medical imaging) to demonstrate the proposed method's ability to maintain high reconstruction quality under various forms of model mismatch, comparing its performance against relevant baselines (standard DL training, data augmentation with model variations, classical methods).
5.  **Analyze Performance and Limitations:** Evaluate the trade-offs between robustness, performance on the nominal model, computational complexity (training and inference/adaptation time), and the scope of uncertainty the method can handle.

**2.3 Significance**
This research holds significant potential for both scientific advancement and practical impact:

*   **Enhanced Reliability:** By explicitly training for robustness against model uncertainty, the proposed method aims to produce DL solvers that are significantly more reliable and trustworthy when deployed in real-world scenarios where perfect model knowledge is unattainable. This is crucial for safety-critical applications like medical diagnosis and scientific discovery based on imaging data.
*   **Improved Generalization:** The meta-learning approach encourages generalization not just across data examples but across variations in the underlying physical process, addressing a key challenge identified in the literature (Generalization Across Models).
*   **Novel Methodology:** It introduces meta-learning as a principled framework for tackling forward model uncertainty in inverse problems, offering a potentially more effective alternative or complement to existing UQ or adaptive methods. This contributes a new perspective to the intersection of deep learning and inverse problems.
*   **Addressing Workshop Goals:** This work directly tackles the workshop's key themes by proposing a fundamental approach to address model uncertainty when only partial system information (represented by the distribution $p(A)$) is available, aiming for more effective and reliable learned solutions.

Successfully achieving the research objectives would represent a significant step towards building practical, robust, and widely deployable deep learning solutions for a vast range of inverse problems encountered in science, medicine, and engineering.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Research Design**
The core of this research is to employ a meta-learning strategy to train a deep neural network $f_\theta$ that acts as a solver for inverse problems. The training process will expose the network to a multitude of "tasks," where each task $\mathcal{T}_i$ involves reconstructing a signal $x$ from measurements $y_i = A_i(x) + n_i$, with the forward operator $A_i$ drawn from a distribution $p(A)$ representing model uncertainty. The goal is for the learned parameters $\theta$ to either represent a solver that performs well on average across tasks from $p(A)$, or to be an initialization that allows for rapid adaptation to a specific task $A_i$ with only a few examples.

**3.2 Data Generation and Forward Model Distribution**
We will utilize standard benchmark datasets for inverse problems, allowing for comparison with existing work. Potential datasets include:
*   **Image Restoration:** MNIST/FashionMNIST (for initial proof-of-concept), CelebA (faces), BSDS500 (natural images), ImageNet (large-scale natural images).
*   **Medical Imaging:** FastMRI dataset (knee/brain MRI), LoDoPaB-CT (low-dose CT).

For each dataset, we need ground truth signals/images $x$. The key component is defining the distribution $p(A)$ over forward operators. This distribution will be designed to model realistic uncertainties:

*   **Nominal Model ($A_0$):** Start with a standard forward operator for the chosen inverse problem (e.g., Gaussian blur kernel, Radon transform, undersampled Fourier transform with known sensitivity maps).
*   **Sampling Perturbations:** Generate $A_i \sim p(A)$ by perturbing $A_0$ or its parameters. Examples include:
    *   **Deblurring:** $A_i$ corresponds to convolution with a kernel $k_i$. $p(A)$ can be defined by sampling kernel parameters (e.g., Gaussian kernel width $\sigma \sim U[\sigma_{min}, \sigma_{max}]$, motion blur angle $\phi \sim U[0, \pi)$ and length $l \sim U[l_{min}, l_{max}])$ or by adding small, random perturbations to the kernel weights.
    *   **MRI Reconstruction:** $A_i$ involves undersampling ($M_i$) and coil sensitivity maps ($S_i$), i.e., $A_i(x) = M_i \mathcal{F} (S_i x)$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is the Fourier transform. $p(A)$ can model uncertainty in $S_i$ (e.g., adding smooth random phase/magnitude variations) or variations in the sampling mask $M_i$ (e.g., stochastic deviations from a predefined pattern).
    *   **Computed Tomography (CT):** $A_i$ is the Radon transform. $p(A)$ could model slight misalignments in projection angles or detector positions, or variations in beam hardening effects.
*   **Noise Models:** We will also consider uncertainty in the noise model $n$. Instead of fixing $n$ to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with a fixed variance, we can sample noise types (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, Rician) and parameters (e.g., noise level $\sigma_n$) for each task $\mathcal{T}_i$. $y_i = A_i(x) + n_i$.

**3.3 Meta-Learning Algorithm**
We propose to primarily investigate Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) [Finn et al., 2017] and its variants (e.g., FOMAML, Reptile) due to their flexibility and proven success in learning adaptable models.

Let $f_\theta(y, A)$ be the neural network solver parameterized by $\theta$, which takes measurements $y$ and potentially some description of the forward operator $A$ (if available/variable) as input, and outputs an estimate $\hat{x}$ of the ground truth $x$. The loss function for a single data point $(x, y)$ under task $\mathcal{T}_i$ (defined by $A_i$) is $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(f_\theta, (x, y)) = \| f_\theta(y, A_i) - x \|_p^p$, where $p$ is typically 1 or 2 (L1 or L2 loss).

The MAML algorithm proceeds as follows:

1.  **Sample Batch of Tasks:** Sample a batch of tasks $\{\mathcal{T}_i\}_{i=1}^B$, where each $\mathcal{T}_i$ is associated with a forward operator $A_i \sim p(A)$ and a noise model.
2.  **Split Task Data:** For each task $\mathcal{T}_i$, generate or sample a small support set $D_{\text{supp}, i} = \{(x_{i,j}^{(s)}, y_{i,j}^{(s)})\}_{j=1}^K$ and a query set $D_{\text{query}, i} = \{(x_{i,k}^{(q)}, y_{i,k}^{(q)})\}_{k=1}^Q$. The measurements are generated as $y = A_i(x) + n_i$.
3.  **Inner Loop (Adaptation):** For each task $\mathcal{T}_i$, compute adapted parameters $\theta'_i$ by taking one or more gradient descent steps on the support set, starting from the current meta-parameters $\theta$:
    $$ \theta'_i = \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta \sum_{j=1}^K \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(f_\theta, (x_{i,j}^{(s)}, y_{i,j}^{(s)})) $$
    This step simulates adapting the model to the specific physics of task $\mathcal{T}_i$.
4.  **Outer Loop (Meta-Optimization):** Update the meta-parameters $\theta$ by minimizing the loss of the *adapted* models $f_{\theta'_i}$ on their respective query sets $D_{\text{query}, i}$. The update rule is:
    $$ \theta \leftarrow \theta - \beta \nabla_\theta \sum_{i=1}^B \sum_{k=1}^Q \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(f_{\theta'_i}, (x_{i,k}^{(q)}, y_{i,k}^{(q)})) $$
    This step optimizes for an initial $\theta$ that leads to good performance after adaptation across the distribution of tasks $p(A)$.

**Alternative Meta-Objective:** Instead of MAML's adaptation focus, we can optimize for average performance across tasks without an explicit inner loop, more akin to robust optimization:
$$ \theta \leftarrow \theta - \beta \nabla_\theta \sum_{i=1}^B \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(f_{\theta}, D_{\text{batch}, i}) $$
where $D_{\text{batch}, i}$ is a batch of data from task $\mathcal{T}_i$. This simpler approach directly encourages $\theta$ to work well on average over $p(A)$. We will compare both approaches.

**Network Architecture:** We will explore architectures suitable for inverse problems, such as:
*   **U-Net:** A standard choice for image-to-image tasks, effective in capturing multi-scale features.
*   **Unrolled Optimization Networks:** Networks that mimic iterative reconstruction algorithms (e.g., learned proximal gradient descent, learned ADMM), allowing incorporation of the forward model $A_i$ within the network structure. Example:
    $$ x^{(k+1)} = \text{Prox}_{\lambda R}(x^{(k)} - \eta_k A_i^T (A_i x^{(k)} - y_i)) $$
    where $\text{Prox}_{\lambda R}$ is replaced by a learned network module $CNN_{\theta_k}$. Meta-learning would optimize the shared parameters $\theta = \{\theta_k\}$. This architecture naturally handles varying $A_i$.

**3.4 Experimental Design and Validation**

*   **Datasets and Tasks:** We will perform experiments on at least two distinct inverse problems:
    *   *Image Deblurring:* Using CelebA or BSDS500, with $p(A)$ modeling variations in Gaussian blur width and potentially other kernel types (motion, defocus) and varying noise levels.
    *   *Undersampled MRI Reconstruction:* Using the FastMRI dataset, with $p(A)$ modeling uncertainties in coil sensitivity maps $S_i$ and/or variations in k-space undersampling masks $M_i$, plus different noise levels.
*   **Baselines for Comparison:**
    1.  **Nominal Training (STD-Nom):** Standard supervised training of $f_\theta$ using only the nominal forward operator $A_0$ and a fixed noise model.
    2.  **Mixture Training (STD-Mix):** Standard supervised training of $f_\theta$ using data generated from multiple operators $A_i$ sampled from $p(A)$ (i.e., data augmentation with forward model variation), but without the meta-learning structure.
    3.  **Classical Methods:** Traditional non-learning methods like Tikhonov regularization or Total Variation (TV) minimization (e.g., using ADMM) applied with the nominal operator $A_0$.
    4.  **Relevant DL Method from Literature:** If feasible, implement or adapt a method addressing model mismatch, e.g., the untrained residual block approach (Guan et al., 2024) for comparison.
*   **Evaluation Scenarios:** The trained models (Meta-Learned, STD-Nom, STD-Mix) and baselines will be evaluated under several conditions:
    1.  **Nominal Performance:** Testing on data generated using the exact nominal model $A_0$. We expect STD-Nom might perform best here.
    2.  **In-Distribution Robustness:** Testing on data generated using *unseen* forward operators $A_j \sim p(A)$ drawn from the *same* distribution used during meta-training (or mixture training). This is the primary scenario to demonstrate the benefit of the proposed method.
    3.  **Out-of-Distribution Robustness:** Testing on data generated using forward operators $A_k$ that are "further away" from $A_0$ than those in $p(A)$, or involve different types of perturbations not seen during training. This assesses the limits of robustness.
    4.  **Adaptation Performance (for MAML-like methods):** For methods trained with an adaptation objective, evaluate performance after performing the inner-loop updates on a few examples from a new test task $A_{test}$.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Quantitative evaluation will use standard image quality metrics:
    *   Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
    *   Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)
    *   Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    Visual inspection of reconstructions will provide qualitative assessment, particularly regarding artifacts introduced by model mismatch. We will also measure:
    *   Training time.
    *   Inference time (and adaptation time if applicable).
*   **Ablation Studies:** We will analyze the impact of key design choices:
    *   Choice of meta-learning algorithm (MAML vs. average performance objective).
    *   Number of inner loop steps ($K$) in MAML.
    *   Complexity/breadth of the forward model distribution $p(A)$.
    *   Network architecture choice.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.2 Impact**
The successful completion of this research is expected to have a substantial impact:

*   **Practical Impact:** Directly contribute to the development of more reliable and trustworthy DL-based inverse problem solutions for real-world applications. This could lead to tangible benefits such as improved diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging (e.g., MRI/CT scans robust to calibration drift or patient positioning variations), more accurate subsurface imaging in geophysics despite environmental unknowns, and enhanced image quality in computational photography under varying conditions. By mitigating the negative effects of unavoidable model imperfections, this work can accelerate the adoption of powerful DL techniques in critical domains.
*   **Scientific Impact:** Advance the understanding of generalization and robustness in deep learning, particularly in the context of physics-based problems. It will establish meta-learning as a viable and principled tool for handling model uncertainty in inverse problems, potentially inspiring similar approaches in related fields dealing with imperfect physical models (e.g., simulation, control). Furthermore, it addresses a key challenge highlighted by the inverse problems and deep learning community, contributing directly to the goals of the workshop.
*   **Foundation for Future Work:** This research can serve as a foundation for exploring more complex uncertainty models (e.g., structured or non-parametric uncertainty), combining meta-learning with other robustness techniques (like UQ or adversarial training), and extending the framework to different types of inverse problems (e.g., involving PDEs or non-Euclidean data).

In summary, this research proposes a rigorous investigation into using meta-learning to overcome a critical barrier in the practical application of deep learning for inverse problems. By fostering robustness against forward model uncertainty, we aim to develop solvers that are not only high-performing but also dependable in the complexities of real-world measurement scenarios.
