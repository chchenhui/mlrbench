**2. Key Challenges**

The main challenges and limitations in current research on robust solvers for inverse problems with forward model uncertainty include:

1. **Model Mismatch**: Accurate reconstruction is hindered when the assumed forward model deviates from the true underlying physics due to simplifications or uncertainties.

2. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Effectively quantifying and propagating uncertainties in both the forward model and the reconstruction process remains a significant challenge.

3. **Generalization Across Models**: Developing solvers that generalize well across a distribution of forward models without overfitting to specific instances is difficult.

4. **Computational Efficiency**: Balancing the computational cost of robust and adaptive solvers with their performance is crucial for practical applications.

5. **Integration of Physical Knowledge**: Incorporating prior physical knowledge into learning-based methods to enhance robustness without compromising flexibility is an ongoing research challenge.
