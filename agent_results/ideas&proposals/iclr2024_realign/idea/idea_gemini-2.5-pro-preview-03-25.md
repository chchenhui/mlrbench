**Title:** Targeted Representational Sculpting Using Alignment Gradients

**Motivation:** Controlling representational similarity between AI models, or aligning AI with biological neural data, is key for interpretability, model merging, and brain-inspired AI. Current methods like joint training or full fine-tuning are often computationally expensive, lack precision, or degrade task performance. We need targeted approaches to predictably modify alignment.

**Main Idea:** We propose a method to precisely increase or decrease representational alignment between specific layers of two systems (e.g., two NNs, or an NN and brain data). Define a differentiable alignment objective (e.g., centered kernel alignment loss) between the target representations. Compute the gradient of this objective with respect to the parameters of *one* system. Use this gradient to perform targeted, low-impact parameter updates (e.g., applying low-rank adaptation or sparse updates) focused only on the layers involved. This "representational sculpting" aims to steer alignment towards a desired level while minimally affecting the system's original task performance. We expect this method to provide fine-grained control over representational similarity, facilitating more efficient and interpretable alignment interventions.
