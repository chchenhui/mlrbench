**Title:** Cross-Domain Representational Alignment via Unified Metric Learning  

**Motivation:** Current alignment metrics often fail to generalize across domains (e.g., neural networks vs. brain activity) or representation types (e.g., vision vs. language), limiting their utility in understanding shared computational principles or designing robust AI. Developing a domain-agnostic framework to measure and enhance alignment could bridge gaps between biological and artificial systems, enabling more interpretable models and cross-disciplinary insights.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a self-supervised contrastive learning framework that learns a unified metric space for comparing representations across diverse domains. The method trains a Siamese neural network to map inputs from different systems (e.g., fMRI data, CNN activations, LLM embeddings) into a shared latent space, using contrastive loss to emphasize structural similarities (e.g., invariance to task-irrelevant transformations) while suppressing domain-specific noise. Domain adversarial training further enforces invariance to modality-specific features. The resulting metric will be evaluated on tasks like cross-species neural comparison, model-brain alignment, and cross-modal AI system interoperability. We expect this approach to reveal universal principles of representation formation, improve transfer learning between biological and artificial systems, and provide actionable tools for calibrating alignment in AI development. Success would advance both neuroscience (e.g., decoding brain activity) and ML (e.g., building more human-aligned models).
