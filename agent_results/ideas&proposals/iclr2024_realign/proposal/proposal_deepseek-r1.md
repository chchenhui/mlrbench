### 2. Introduction  

#### Background  
Understanding how intelligent systems—biological or artificial—form internal representations is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, cognitive science, and machine learning. While advances in deep learning have enabled artificial neural networks (ANNs) to achieve human-like performance on specific tasks, comparing their representations to those of biological systems (e.g., primate vision, human language processing) remains fraught with challenges. Differences in data modalities (e.g., fMRI signals vs. ANN activations), scales, and structures hinder the development of robust metrics for representational alignment. Existing alignment methods, such as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), often fail to generalize across domains due to their sensitivity to domain-specific biases and inability to handle class-conditional distribution shifts.  

#### Research Objectives  
This project aims to:  
1. Develop a **domain-agnostic framework** for measuring representational alignment by learning invariant feature spaces that bridge biological and artificial systems.  
2. Validate the framework by testing whether alignment scores predict behavioral congruence (e.g., task performance, error patterns) across domains.  
3. Identify conserved computational features that enable systematic interventions to improve alignment (e.g., guiding ANN training with neural data).  

#### Significance  
A robust alignment metric would advance interdisciplinary research by enabling direct comparisons of computational strategies across intelligences. This could inform theories of universal learning principles, improve AI systems’ interoperability with biological processes (e.g., brain-computer interfaces), and address ethical concerns around value alignment in AI.

### 3. Methodology  

#### Research Design  
The framework combines adversarial training and contrastive learning to project representations from disparate domains into a shared invariant space. It addresses key challenges from the literature, including modality differences, class-conditional shifts, and false negatives in contrastive learning.  

##### **Data Collection**  
- **Biological Systems**:  
  - Vision: Primate fMRI data from the *Natural Scenes Dataset* (NSD) and mouse visual cortex recordings.  
  - Language: Human EEG/fMRI data from language comprehension tasks (e.g., *Pereira et al., 2018*).  
- **Artificial Systems**:  
  - Vision: Activation maps from CNNs (ResNet, ViT) and transformers trained on ImageNet.  
  - Language: Hidden states from LLMs (GPT-4, BERT) fine-tuned on text corpora aligned with human experiments.  

##### **Algorithmic Framework**  
1. **Adversarial Domain Alignment**:  
   A domain classifier $D$ is trained to distinguish source (e.g., ANN) and target (e.g., fMRI) domains, while a feature extractor $F$ is optimized to fool $D$ via gradient reversal. The adversarial loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}}$ is:  
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{X}_S}[\log D(F(x))] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{X}_T}[\log (1 - D(F(x)))],
   $$  
   where $\mathcal{X}_S$ and $\mathcal{X}_T$ are source and target domains.  

2. **Contrastive Feature Refinement**:  
   A two-stage contrastive loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{cont}}$ enhances intra-class compactness and inter-class separation:  
   - **Stage 1**: Align cross-domain positive pairs (same class) using a modified NT-Xent loss.  
   - **Stage 2**: Mitigate false negatives by excluding samples with high feature similarity to the anchor (inspired by *Thota & Leontidis, 2021*).  
   For an anchor $x_i$, positive set $\mathcal{P}_i$, and filtered negative set $\mathcal{N}_i$,  
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{cont}} = -\frac{1}{|\mathcal{P}_i|} \sum_{x_j \in \mathcal{P}_i} \log \frac{\exp(s_{ij}/\tau)}{\sum_{x_k \in \{\mathcal{P}_i \cup \mathcal{N}_i\}} \exp(s_{ik}/\tau)},
   $$  
   where $s_{ij}$ is the cosine similarity between $F(x_i)$ and $F(x_j)$, and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.  

3. **Pseudo-Labeling for Unsupervised Adaptation**:  
   For target domains without labels, cluster target features using k-means initialized with source class centroids (*Wang et al., 2021*) to generate pseudo-labels.  

##### **Experimental Validation**  
- **Benchmark Tasks**:  
  - *Vision*: Align primate fMRI responses with CNN/transformer activations on image classification.  
  - *Language*: Align human EEG responses with LLM hidden states on sentence comprehension.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  1. **Alignment Score**: Mean similarity (cosine) between cross-domain features in the invariant space.  
  2. **Behavioral Congruence**: Correlation between alignment scores and task performance (e.g., accuracy, reaction times).  
  3. **Error Pattern Similarity**: KL divergence between error distributions of biological and artificial systems.  
- **Baselines**: Compare against CCA, RSA, and state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods (CDA, CDCL).

### 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

#### Expected Outcomes  
1. **Domain-Agnostic Alignment Metric**: A framework that generalizes across biological and artificial domains, outperforming existing methods by ≥15% in cross-domain similarity (measured by cosine distance).  
2. **Conserved Feature Identification**: Discovery of hierarchical visual features (e.g., edge detectors in V1 vs. CNN initial layers) and linguistic structures (e.g., syntax-sensitive neurons in Broca’s area vs. transformer attention heads) shared across intelligences.  
3. **Intervention Strategies**: Demonstrated ability to improve ANN performance by 10–20% on vision/language tasks when trained with neural data regularization.  

#### Impact  
- **Theoretical**: Unify disparate theories of intelligence by identifying universal computational strategies.  
- **Technical**: Enable safer AI systems via alignment with human cognitive priors (e.g., reducing harmful biases).  
- **Translational**: Accelerate neuroprosthetics development by improving ANN-brain interoperability.
