**Title:** Cross-Domain Representational Alignment via Invariant Feature Spaces  

**Motivation:** Current metrics for measuring fail to fail to generalize across domains (e.g., biological vs. artificial neural networks) due to differences in data modalities, scales, and structures. This limits their utility in understanding shared computational principles and designing interoperable systems.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a framework that learns *invariant feature spaces* to quantify alignment between representations from disparate domains (e.g., fMRI. deep. deep network activations). Leverage domain adaptation techniques, such as adversarial training or contrastive learning, to project representations into a shared space where geometric or statistical similarities reflect functional equivalence. Validate the approach by aligning representations across diverse pairs (e.g., primate vision vs. CNNs/Transformers, human language vs. LLMs) and testing if alignment scores predict behavioral congruence (e.g., task performance, error patterns). Expected outcomes include a domain-agnostic alignment metric and insights into which features are conserved across intelligences. This could enable systematic interventions to improve alignment (e.g., guiding model training with neural data) and inform theories of universal computational strategies.
