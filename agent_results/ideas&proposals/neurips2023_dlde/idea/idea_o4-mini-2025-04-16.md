Title: NeuroIMEX – A Learned Error-Corrected Implicit-Explicit Solver for Neural Differential Equations

Motivation:  
Neural ODEs and diffusion models often face numerical stiffness and high computational cost, limiting their use in real-time control and high-resolution simulations. Classical implicit-explicit (IMEX) integrators offer stability but require costly parameter tuning and lack adaptivity to diverse dynamics.  

Main Idea:  
We propose NeuroIMEX, a hybrid solver that couples a traditional IMEX scheme with a trainable neural “error corrector.” During each integration step, the IMEX integrator predicts a provisional update, and the neural module estimates local truncation error to adjust the step size and correct the state. The corrector network is meta-trained on a family of stiff ODE/PDE benchmarks (e.g., chemical kinetics, fluid dynamics) using a differentiable solver loop, optimizing for minimal function evaluations under a stability constraint. At inference, NeuroIMEX dynamically balances implicit and explicit contributions, achieving larger stable time steps. We expect 5× fewer evaluations than pure IMEX, robust stability across stiffness regimes, and improved generalization to unseen dynamics—enabling faster, more reliable deep-learning–powered simulations and control.
