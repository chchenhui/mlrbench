**Title:** Meta-Learning Physics-Informed Solvers for High-Dimensional Parametric PDEs

**Motivation:** Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) across high-dimensional parameter spaces is vital for applications like uncertainty quantification and inverse problems, but computationally prohibitive with classical methods. Current deep learning (DL) solvers often require extensive training data (solver runs) or struggle to generalize efficiently across the parameter manifold.

**Main Idea:** We propose Meta-PINN (Meta-Learning Physics-Informed Neural Network), a framework designed to rapidly adapt to new PDE parameters with minimal data. The core idea is to apply meta-learning algorithms (e.g., MAML) to train a PINN. Instead of learning a single solution, Meta-PINN learns an initialization that can be quickly fine-tuned to solve the PDE for unseen parameter values using only the physics-informed loss (PDE residual) and potentially sparse boundary/initial condition data. This leverages the structure of the PDE family itself as the learning signal during meta-training and adaptation, drastically reducing the need for expensive solver data and enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces. Expected outcomes include significantly faster parametric PDE analysis and improved generalization capabilities compared to standard PINNs or operator learning methods.
