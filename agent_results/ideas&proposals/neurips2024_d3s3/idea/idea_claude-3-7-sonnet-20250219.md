# Neural Uncertainty Quantification for Bridging Sim2Real Gap in Autonomous Vehicle Testing

## Motivation
Autonomous vehicle (AV) testing relies heavily on simulations due to the impracticality and risk of extensive real-world testing. However, the simulation-to-reality gap remains a critical challenge, leading to models that perform well in simulation but fail in real environments. This gap stems from the inability of traditional simulations to accurately model the full range of uncertainties present in real-world scenarios, particularly rare edge cases and environmental variations that are difficult to parametrize deterministically.

## Main Idea
I propose a neural probabilistic simulation framework that enhances autonomous vehicle testing by explicitly modeling uncertainty in the sim2real transfer. The approach uses a dual-network architecture: a primary generative network creates simulation scenarios, while a companion uncertainty quantification network models the distribution of potential real-world deviations. The system learns these deviations through a novel calibration process using limited real-world data paired with simulated counterparts. The framework employs Bayesian neural operators to efficiently propagate uncertainty through the simulation pipeline, allowing for importance sampling of critical edge cases. This approach provides statistically rigorous confidence bounds on AV performance metrics, enabling developers to identify high-risk scenarios requiring additional real-world testing while reducing overall testing requirements by focusing real-world validation on statistically significant edge cases identified through uncertainty-aware simulation.
