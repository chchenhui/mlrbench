**Title**: Differentiable Neural Fields for Probabilistic Fluid Dynamics Simulations  

**Motivation**:  
Simulating fluid dynamics is critical for domains like aerospace engineering and climate science but is computationally expensive and limited by numerical solver resolution. Existing ML surrogates often lack generalization, physical consistency, and uncertainty quantification. Addressing these gaps, this work proposes a hybrid data-driven and differentiable framework for fluid simulations with epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty modeling.  

**Main Idea**:  
We introduce *Differentiable Neural Fields* (DiNeF), a spatiotemporal representation combining neural fields and probabilistic operator learning. DiNeF uses coordinate-based neural networks to encode physical domains, embedded with differentiable physics priors (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations) as implicit regularization. To address uncertainty, Gaussian process layers parameterize time-varying uncertainty bounds, and spectral neural operators enable efficient propagation of aleatoric uncertainty through time. A hierarchical training pipeline incorporates data assimilation, jointly optimizing the surrogate and uncertainty estimates via adjoint-based backpropagation. This bridges the sim2real gap by training on hybrid datasets (simulation + sparse real-world sensor data). We target 3D turbulent flows, aiming to reduce simulation time by >10x while outperforming traditional solvers and CNN-based surrogates in accuracy and reliability. The frameworkâ€™s differentiability enables gradient-based optimization for inverse problems (e.g., flow control) and uncertainty-aware design. Impact: enabling rapid, physics-informed prototyping in engineering and climate modeling with quantified confidence levels.
