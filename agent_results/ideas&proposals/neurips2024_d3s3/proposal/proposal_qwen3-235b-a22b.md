# Conditional Neural Operator for Probabilistic Inverse Modeling in Turbulent Flows

## 1. Introduction

### Background  
Inverse modeling of turbulent flows — inferring high-dimensional parameter fields (e.g., velocity, pressure, Reynolds stress) from sparse observations — is a foundational challenge in fluid dynamics. This task is critical for applications like flow control, aerodynamic design, and uncertainty quantification, where traditional methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and adjoint-based solvers suffer from prohibitive computational costs and limited uncertainty estimation capabilities. For instance, MCMC requires repeated evaluations of forward solvers, each solving Navier–Stokes equations computationally on $10^6$-dimensional grids. Such methods become infeasible for real-time control or probabilistic inference under data scarcity, a common constraint in experimental fluid mechanics.

Recent advances in machine learning offer transformative solutions. Neural operators, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) [1], have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in learning the forward solution maps of partial differential equations (PDEs) for turbulent flows, achieving speedups of 1,000× over finite-element methods. Concurrently, probabilistic graphical models like conditional normalizing flows [2] enable flexible approximation of posterior distributions in high-dimensional spaces. However, existing methods often treat forward and inverse problems separately, leading to misaligned representations and poor uncertainty calibration.

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to design, implement, and validate a **Conditional Neural Operator (CNO)** that unifies forward surrogate modeling and probabilistic inverse inference for turbulent flows. Specifically, the CNO will:  
1. Learn the forward solution map $F: \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{Y}$ from parameter fields $u \in \mathcal{U}$ (e.g., initial/forcing conditions) to observational outputs $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ (e.g., sparse sensor readings), parameterized by an FNO architecture.  
2. Construct an approximate posterior $p_\psi(u|y)$ using a conditional normalizing flow that maps sparse observations $y$ to a distribution over input parameters.  
3. Train both modules end-to-end via amortized variational inference on synthetic Navier–Stokes simulations, ensuring consistency between the forward and inverse maps.  

### Significance  
By integrating neural operators with probabilistic inference, the CNO will address three key challenges in simulation-based science:  
- **Speed-accuracy trade-offs**: Replace iterative solvers with a differentiable, learnable surrogate for real-time posterior sampling and optimization.  
- **Uncertainty quantification (UQ)**: Explicitly separate epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties via calibrated predictive intervals.  
- **Simulation-to-real generalization**: Embed physics-based inductive biases (e.g., Fourier spectral operators) to improve transfer from synthetic training data to real-world scenarios.  

This work aligns with the workshop’s mission to bridge machine learning and physics-based simulations by creating a tool that combines differentiability, probabilistic rigor, and computational efficiency for real-world inverse problems.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
**Benchmark Dataset**: Synthetic 2D Navier–Stokes simulations will be generated across varying Reynolds numbers ($Re = 100-10,000$) and forcing terms. These simulations will produce high-resolution velocity/pressure fields, from which sparse observations $y \in \mathbb{R}^d$ (e.g., $d=100$ sensor readings) and boundary conditions $u$ (initial velocity, forcing locations) are derived. Noise $n \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$ will be added to $y$ to model measurement uncertainty.  

**Preprocessing**:  
1. Parameter fields $u$ (resolution: $128 \times 128$) are normalized to $[-1,1]$.  
2. Observations $y$ are augmented with spatial coordinates to preserve geometric context for the inverse problem.

### 2.2 Architecture & Algorithm  

#### 2.2.1 Forward Surrogate: Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)  
We parameterize the forward map $F$ with a 3-layer FNO [3], which learns the operator directly in Fourier space:  
$$  
G_\theta(u) = D \cdot \left( \mathcal{F}^{-1} \left( \left( R \cdot \sigma \left( \mathcal{F}(A \cdot u) \otimes \phi \right) \right)_{\text{low}} \right) \right)  
$$  
Here:  
- $A, R$ are adaptive projection layers.  
- $\phi \in \mathbb{C}^{k}$ is a learnable kernel function in frequency space ($k=2$).  
- $\sigma$ is the activation function.  
The output $G_\theta(u) = \hat{y} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ approximates sparse observations $y$.  

#### 2.2.2 Conditional Posterior Model  
The inverse problem is modeled using a **conditional normalizing flow** $T_\psi: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathcal{U}$, which defines a bijection between a base distribution $z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_n)$ and samples from the posterior $p(u|y)$:  
$$  
u = T_\psi(z; y), \quad z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_n).  
$$  
This flow uses **context conditioning**: $y$ modulates affine transformations in each coupling layer via neural networks:  
$$  
s_t, t_t = f_\psi^t(y), \quad z_{t+1} = z_t \odot \exp(s_t) + t_t \quad \text{(for dimension } t).  
$$  

#### 2.2.3 End-to-End Training  
The CNO is trained via amortized variational inference [2], minimizing the ELBO:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{ELBO}} = -\mathbb{E}_{u \sim p_{\text{train}}(u)} \left[ \log p(y|u) \right] + D_{\text{KL}}\left( q_\psi(u|y) \, \middle\| \, p(u) \right),  
$$  
where $p(u)$ is a uniform/Gaussian prior. This is approximated as:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{ELBO}} = \lambda \cdot \|G_\theta(u) - y\|_2^2 + \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p(y)} \left[ D_{\text{KL}}(q_\psi(u|y) \| p(u)) \right].  
$$  
Here, $\lambda = \sigma^{-2}$ balances reconstruction fidelity and posterior regularization.  

**Implementation Details**:  
- **Hyperparameters**: Batch size 32, Adam optimizer with learning rate $3 \times 10^{-4}$, Fourier modes $k=32$.  
- **Regularization**: Spectral normalization in the FNO; early stopping on validation NLL.

### 2.3 Experimental Design  

#### 2.3.1 Baseline Models  
1. **MCMC with True Solver**: pCN algorithm [4] using ground-truth Navier–Stokes solver.  
2. **Conditional GAN (cGAN)**: Maps $y$ to deterministic $u$ estimates.  
3. **Conditional Neural Fields (CoNFiLD)** [5]: Generative flow-based inverse solver with fixed spatial encoding.

#### 2.3.2 Evaluation Metrics  
1. **Inversion Accuracy**:  
   - Mean squared error (MSE): $\mathbb{E}[\|u - \hat{u}\|_2^2]$.  
   - Pearson correlation coefficient between samples.  
2. **Uncertainty Calibration**:  
   - Coverage probability of 95% prediction intervals (ideal: 95%).  
   - Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) [6].  
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Wall-clock time per posterior sample.  

#### 2.3.3 Tasks  
1. **Sparse Reconstruction**: Reconstruct initial vorticity fields from $d=50$ noisy sensors.  
2. **Design Optimization**: Gradient ascent on $y^*$ predictions to maximize wall shear stress.  
3. **Generalization**: Transfer to $Re=500$ flows not seen during training.

2. A new benchmark for probabilistic turbulent flow inversion, including synthetic datasets and evaluation suite.  
3. Open-source code implementation optimized for GPU clusters, compatible with PyTorch and PyMC3.

### 3.2 Empirical Results  
We hypothesize that:  
- The CNO will achieve MSE < 5% of the $L^2$-norm of the true $u$ for $Re=1000$, outperforming cGAN (MSE > 15%) and CoNFiLD.  
- CRPS will improve by 40% over MCMC baselines, demonstrating superior uncertainty calibration.  
- Inference time will drop from hours (MCMC) to seconds (CNO), enabling gradient-based design.

### 3.3 Scientific Impact  
This proposal directly contributes to:  
- **Simulation-to-Real Transfer**: Epistemic uncertainty estimates will identify discrepancies between synthetic trainers and physical sensors, improving robustness in wind tunnel experiments.  
- **Active Flow Control**: The CNO’s differentiability allows backpropagation through the surrogate to optimize actuator placements in real time.  
- **Community Building**: Hosting a Kaggle-style competition on the generated turbulent flow dataset will bridge ML researchers and fluid mechanics practitioners, as emphasized in the workshop’s interdisciplinary mission.
