# Conditional Neural Operator for Probabilistic Inverse Modeling in Turbulent Flows with Uncertainty Quantification

## 1. Introduction

Turbulent flow phenomena are ubiquitous in natural and engineered systems, from atmospheric dynamics to industrial processes. The ability to accurately invert partial observations of turbulent flows to infer underlying parameters is critical for numerous applications, including weather prediction, aerospace design optimization, and environmental monitoring. However, traditional inverse modeling approaches face significant challenges when applied to turbulent flows due to their high-dimensional, non-linear, and chaotic nature.

Conventional methods for solving inverse problems in turbulent flows typically rely on iterative optimization procedures that require numerous forward simulations, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or adjoint-based approaches. These methods are computationally prohibitive for real-time applications and often struggle to adequately characterize the full posterior distribution over parameters, especially under data scarcity. Moreover, they frequently lack robust uncertainty quantification capabilities, failing to distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties - a critical distinction in high-stakes decision-making contexts.

Recent advances in machine learning, particularly neural operators and generative models, offer promising alternatives for addressing these challenges. Neural operators (Li et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2021) have demonstrated remarkable success in learning the solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs), enabling fast approximation of forward simulations. Concurrently, developments in normalizing flows (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015) and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) have provided powerful frameworks for modeling complex probability distributions. However, these approaches have largely been developed separately, with limited exploration of their potential integration for robust inverse modeling with uncertainty quantification.

This research aims to bridge this gap by developing a novel Conditional Neural Operator (CNO) framework that jointly learns both the forward PDE solution map and an approximate posterior over input parameters given sparse observations. Our approach combines the representational power of Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for encoding PDE structure with the probabilistic expressiveness of conditional normalizing flows for posterior modeling. By training both components end-to-end via amortized variational inference, we enable real-time posterior sampling at inference time while maintaining differentiability for gradient-based optimization.

The significance of this research extends across multiple dimensions. First, it addresses the fundamental challenge of real-time inverse modeling in high-dimensional turbulent systems, which has remained computationally intractable with traditional methods. Second, our approach provides comprehensive uncertainty quantification, distinguishing between epistemic uncertainty (stemming from model limitations) and aleatoric uncertainty (arising from inherent system stochasticity). Third, by ensuring differentiability of the entire pipeline, we enable gradient-based design optimization and control. Finally, our method bridges the simulation-to-real gap by incorporating uncertainty awareness into the modeling framework, potentially improving robustness when deployed on real-world data.

Building upon recent work by Du et al. (2024) on conditional neural field latent diffusion models, Wang et al. (2024) on FNO-based turbulent flow prediction, and Haitsiukevich et al. (2024) on diffusion models as probabilistic neural operators, our research advances the state-of-the-art in neural surrogate modeling for inverse problems. We specifically address limitations in spectral representation identified by Oommen et al. (2024) and extend the probabilistic treatment to enable comprehensive uncertainty quantification.

In summary, this research proposes an innovative approach to probabilistic inverse modeling in turbulent flows that combines neural operators with conditional normalizing flows in an end-to-end trainable framework. The resulting method offers unprecedented speed, accuracy, and uncertainty awareness for inverse modeling in complex physical systems.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed Conditional Neural Operator (CNO) framework integrates two key components: (1) a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) that learns the forward mapping from input parameters to turbulent flow fields, and (2) a conditional normalizing flow that models the posterior distribution over input parameters given sparse observations. Both components are trained jointly through an amortized variational inference approach. We detail the mathematical formulation, algorithmic implementation, data generation process, and experimental design below.

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

We consider the Navier-Stokes equations governing incompressible turbulent flow:

$$\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{f}$$
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$$

where $\mathbf{u}$ represents the velocity field, $p$ the pressure, $\rho$ the density, $\nu$ the kinematic viscosity, and $\mathbf{f}$ external forcing.

Let $\mathcal{G}$ denote the solution operator that maps input parameters $v \in \mathcal{V}$ (which could include initial conditions, boundary conditions, or forcing terms) to the corresponding flow solution $u \in \mathcal{U}$:

$$\mathcal{G}: \mathcal{V} \rightarrow \mathcal{U}, \quad \mathcal{G}(v) = u$$

The inverse problem can be formulated as follows: Given sparse observations $y = \mathcal{M}(u) + \eta$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is a measurement operator that maps the full solution $u$ to observed quantities (e.g., velocity measurements at discrete points) and $\eta$ represents measurement noise, we aim to infer the posterior distribution $p(v|y)$ over input parameters.

### 2.2 Fourier Neural Operator for Forward Modeling

We employ the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) architecture to learn the forward solution operator $\mathcal{G}$. The FNO parameterizes the operator as a composition of Fourier integral operators with learned kernels:

$$(\mathcal{K}_\phi f)(x) = \sigma\left(W f(x) + \int_D \kappa_\phi(x, y)f(y)dy\right)$$

where $\kappa_\phi$ is the kernel parameterized by neural networks, $W$ is a linear transformation, and $\sigma$ is a nonlinear activation function.

The integral operator is efficiently computed in Fourier space:

$$(\mathcal{K}_\phi f)(x) = \sigma\left(W f(x) + \mathcal{F}^{-1}(R_\phi \cdot \mathcal{F}(f))(x)\right)$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ denote the Fourier transform and its inverse, respectively, and $R_\phi$ is a learnable filter in Fourier space. To mitigate the spectral bias identified in previous work, we incorporate a multi-resolution approach with adaptive frequency filters:

$$R_\phi = \sum_{i=1}^{L} \alpha_i R_{\phi,i}$$

where $\{R_{\phi,i}\}_{i=1}^{L}$ are frequency filters operating at different scales, and $\{\alpha_i\}_{i=1}^{L}$ are learnable weights.

The FNO is structured as:

$$\mathcal{G}_\theta(v) = \mathcal{Q} \circ \mathcal{K}_{\phi_L} \circ \sigma \circ ... \circ \sigma \circ \mathcal{K}_{\phi_1} \circ \mathcal{P}(v)$$

where $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are projection and lifting operators implemented as neural networks, and $\theta$ encompasses all learnable parameters.

### 2.3 Conditional Normalizing Flow for Posterior Modeling

To model the posterior distribution $p(v|y)$, we employ a conditional normalizing flow. Normalizing flows transform a simple base distribution (e.g., a standard Gaussian) into a complex target distribution through a sequence of invertible transformations.

We define our conditional normalizing flow as:

$$p_\psi(v|y) = p_Z(z) \left| \det \frac{\partial f_\psi^{-1}(z; y)}{\partial z} \right|$$

where $z = f_\psi(v; y)$ is the result of applying the flow transformation conditioned on observation $y$, $p_Z$ is a standard Gaussian base distribution, and $\psi$ represents the flow parameters.

We implement the conditional flow using a neural spline flow architecture (Durkan et al., 2019), which uses piecewise rational-quadratic splines for flexible density modeling:

$$f_\psi(v; y) = f_{\psi_K} \circ ... \circ f_{\psi_1}(v; y)$$

Each transformation $f_{\psi_i}$ is parameterized by a neural network that takes $y$ as a conditional input. To ensure computational efficiency and effective conditioning, we employ a hypernetwork architecture:

$$\psi_i = h_\omega(g_\gamma(y))$$

where $g_\gamma$ is an encoder network that processes the observations $y$ into a latent representation, and $h_\omega$ is a hypernetwork that generates the parameters for the flow transformation.

### 2.4 End-to-End Training via Amortized Variational Inference

We train the entire model end-to-end using an amortized variational inference approach. The objective is to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO):

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta, \psi) = \mathbb{E}_{v \sim p_{\text{data}}(v), u \sim p_{\text{data}}(u|v), y \sim p(y|u)} \left[ \log p_\psi(v|y) + \log p(y|\mathcal{G}_\theta(v)) \right]$$

The first term encourages accurate posterior modeling, while the second term ensures that the forward model correctly predicts observations. The log-likelihood of observations is modeled as:

$$\log p(y|\mathcal{G}_\theta(v)) = -\frac{1}{2\sigma_y^2} \| y - \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G}_\theta(v)) \|^2 - \frac{n}{2}\log(2\pi\sigma_y^2)$$

where $\sigma_y^2$ is the observation noise variance, and $n$ is the number of observations.

To regularize the FNO and improve its spectral properties, we add a spectral consistency loss:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{spectral}}(\theta) = \| \mathcal{E}(\mathcal{G}_\theta(v)) - \mathcal{E}(u) \|^2$$

where $\mathcal{E}$ computes the energy spectrum of the flow field.

The final training objective becomes:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}}(\theta, \psi) = \mathcal{L}(\theta, \psi) - \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{spectral}}(\theta)$$

where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter balancing the two loss components.

### 2.5 Uncertainty Quantification

A key contribution of our approach is the explicit quantification of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We decompose the total predictive uncertainty into:

1. **Aleatoric uncertainty**: Inherent stochasticity in the system, captured by the spread of the posterior distribution $p_\psi(v|y)$.

2. **Epistemic uncertainty**: Model uncertainty due to limited data or model misspecification, estimated using deep ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). We train an ensemble of $M$ models $\{(\mathcal{G}_{\theta_m}, p_{\psi_m})\}_{m=1}^M$ with different random initializations.

The total predictive distribution for a new observation $y_*$ is given by:

$$p(v|y_*) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M p_{\psi_m}(v|y_*)$$

We quantify uncertainty through:
- Posterior entropy: $H[p(v|y_*)]$
- Mutual information: $I[v, m|y_*] = H[\frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M p_{\psi_m}(v|y_*)] - \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M H[p_{\psi_m}(v|y_*)]$

The former captures total uncertainty, while the latter specifically measures epistemic uncertainty.

### 2.6 Data Generation and Preprocessing

We generate synthetic training data using direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equations in a canonical turbulent channel flow configuration. The simulation parameters include:

- Channel dimensions: $2\pi \times 2 \times \pi$ in the streamwise, wall-normal, and spanwise directions
- Reynolds number range: $Re_\tau \in [180, 590]$
- Grid resolution: $128 \times 128 \times 128$
- Time step: $\Delta t = 0.001$

We generate 10,000 simulation runs with varying initial conditions, Reynolds numbers, and forcing terms. Each simulation is run until statistical stationarity, after which 100 snapshots are collected at intervals of 0.1 eddy turnover times.

The input parameters $v$ include:
- Reynolds number
- Initial vorticity field (parameterized by 100 Fourier modes)
- Forcing amplitude and frequency

The output flow fields $u$ consist of three-dimensional velocity and pressure fields. For training, we generate synthetic observations $y$ by:
1. Randomly placing 50-200 virtual sensors in the domain
2. Extracting velocity measurements at these locations
3. Adding Gaussian noise with variance scaled based on the local velocity magnitude

All data is normalized to have zero mean and unit variance to stabilize training.

### 2.7 Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics

We design a comprehensive set of experiments to validate our approach:

1. **Forward Model Accuracy**: We evaluate the accuracy of the FNO in predicting full flow fields from input parameters using:
   - Mean squared error (MSE)
   - Energy spectrum error
   - Turbulence statistics matching (Reynolds stresses, dissipation rate)

2. **Inverse Modeling Performance**: We assess the quality of posterior inference through:
   - Negative log-likelihood (NLL) on test set
   - Expected calibration error (ECE)
   - Coverage probability of credible intervals

3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: We evaluate the quality of uncertainty estimates via:
   - Correlation between predictive entropy and actual error
   - Sharpness of predictive distributions
   - Proper scoring rules (CRPS: Continuous Ranked Probability Score)

4. **Computational Efficiency**: We benchmark computational performance against traditional methods:
   - Wall-clock time for posterior sampling
   - Memory requirements
   - Scaling with problem dimension

5. **Application to Inverse Design**: We demonstrate the utility of our approach in inverse design tasks:
   - Inferring optimal initial conditions to achieve desired flow patterns
   - Quantifying uncertainty in design parameters

6. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: We assess the model's generalization to real experimental data:
   - Performance on PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) data
   - Calibration of uncertainty estimates on out-of-distribution data

For all experiments, we use 70% of the data for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. We implement 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness of results. Statistical significance is assessed using paired t-tests with a significance level of 0.05.
