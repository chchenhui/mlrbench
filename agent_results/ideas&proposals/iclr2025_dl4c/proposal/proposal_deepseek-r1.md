**Human-AI Co-Adaptation Loops: Enabling Personalized Code Assistants Through Continuous Feedback and Meta-Learning**

### **2. Introduction**  

**Background**  
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, yet their one-size-fits-all approach often fails to adapt to individual developers’ workflows, preferences, or coding habits. This limitation reduces productivity and creates friction in human-AI collaboration. While recent work (e.g., MPCODER, CodingGenie) has explored personalized code generation and proactive assistance, these systems lack mechanisms for *continuous, bidirectional adaptation*—where both the AI and user iteratively refine their interactions. The emerging paradigm of "human-AI co-adaptation" [6, 8] offers a promising direction but remains underexplored in programming contexts.  

**Research Objectives**  
This project aims to:  
1. Design a framework for **continuous human-AI co-adaptation** in code assistants, leveraging multi-modal user feedback (code edits, voice commands, UI interactions).  
2. Develop lightweight online and meta-learning algorithms to personalize LLMs in real time while preserving stability and privacy.  
3. Evaluate the impact of co-adaptation on developer productivity, code correctness, and user satisfaction through controlled experiments and real-world deployment.  

**Significance**  
By enabling AI assistants to learn from and adapt to individual developers dynamically, this work bridges critical gaps in human-AI collaboration for code. It advances the DL4C workshop’s focus on *developer productivity, HCI for code*, and *responsible AI* by providing a scalable, user-centric adaptation framework.

### **3. Methodology**  

#### **3.1 Data Collection & Feedback Mechanisms**  
**IDE Plug-in Design**  
- Develop a cross-platform IDE extension (for VS Code, PyCharm) to capture:  
  - **Implicit feedback**: Code edits (diffs), acceptance/rejection of suggestions, dwell time on AI outputs.  
  - **Explicit feedback**: Voice commands (e.g., “Prioritize Python list comprehensions”), slider-based UI controls for adjusting verbosity/creativity.  
  - **Contextual metadata**: Active file type, project structure, IDE state (debugging, testing).  

**Privacy-Preserving Data Handling**  
- Implement federated learning to keep raw user data on-device.  
- Use differential privacy (DP) to anonymize aggregated feedback:  
  $$ \mathcal{M}(x) = f(x) + \text{Laplace}(0, \Delta f / \epsilon) $$  
  where $f(x)$ is the feedback aggregation function and $\epsilon$ controls privacy guarantees.  

#### **3.2 Algorithmic Framework**  
**Base Model Architecture**  
- Start with a pre-trained code LLM (e.g., CodeLlama-13B) as the foundation.  

**Online Adaptation via Meta-Learning**  
- Apply Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) [Finn et al., 2017] to enable rapid personalization:  
  1. **Inner Loop**: For each user $i$, compute task-specific update:  
     $$ \theta_i' = \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(f_{\theta}) $$  
     where $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}$ is the loss on user $i$’s data (code suggestions + feedback).  
  2. **Meta-Update**: Optimize initial parameters $\theta$ across all users:  
     $$ \theta \leftarrow \theta - \beta \nabla_\theta \sum_{\mathcal{T}_i} \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(f_{\theta_i'}) $$  

**Feedback-Informed Loss Function**  
Combine task loss and feedback alignment:  
$$ \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim \mathcal{D}}[-\log P(y|x;\theta)]}_{\text{Code Generation Loss}} + \lambda \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{f \sim \mathcal{F}}[d(f, f_{\text{user}})]}_{\text{Feedback Alignment Loss}} $$  
where $d(\cdot)$ measures divergence between model feedback $f$ and user-provided feedback $f_{\text{user}}$, weighted by $\lambda$.  

**Real-Time Update Strategy**  
- Use replay buffers to store recent user interactions, preventing catastrophic forgetting.  
- Apply elastic weight consolidation (EWC) for regularization:  
  $$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{EWC}} = \mathcal{L}(\theta) + \sum_j \frac{\gamma}{2} F_j (\theta_j - \theta_j^*)^2 $$  
  where $F_j$ is the Fisher information for parameter $j$, and $\theta_j^*$ are the "important" parameters from prior tasks.  

#### **3.3 Experimental Design**  
**Evaluation Metrics**  
1. **Code Correctness**: Execution success rate on HumanEval [Chen et al., 2021] and user-specific unit tests.  
2. **Productivity**: Time-to-completion for GitHub issue resolution tasks, keystroke savings.  
3. **User Satisfaction**: Likert-scale surveys (1–5) on usability, trust, and perceived utility.  
4. **Adaptation Efficiency**: Convergence time for personalization (measured in feedback instances).  

**Baselines**  
- Non-personalized LLM (CodeLlama)  
- MPCODER [1] (personalized style learning)  
- CodingGenie [5] (proactive suggestions)  

**Study Protocol**  
1. **Controlled Lab Study**: 30 developers solve 10 programming tasks each across 3 conditions (our system vs. baselines).  
2. **Longitudinal Deployment**: 6-month field study with 50 developers using the IDE plug-in daily. Track metrics via logs and biweekly surveys.  

**Statistical Analysis**  
- Mixed-effects models to account for user variability.  
- Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing.

### **5. Conclusion**  
This proposal addresses a critical gap in AI-assisted programming by formalizing human-AI co-adaptation as a continuous, bidirectional process. By integrating meta-learning with multi-modal feedback, we aim to create code assistants that evolve with their users—enhancing productivity while respecting privacy. The work directly aligns with DL4C’s focus on *developer-centric AI* and *responsible innovation*, offering both technical advances and practical tools for the community.
