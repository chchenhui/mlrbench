# Title: Self-Critique AI Agents: Improving Code Generation Through Execution and Error Analysis

## Motivation
Despite advancements in AI code generation, models still produce code that fails upon execution or contains logical errors. This gap exists because models often generate syntactically valid but functionally incorrect code without learning from their mistakes. Current approaches typically rely on human feedback to improve, which isn't scalable. We need autonomous systems that can identify their own errors, understand failure modes, and iteratively improve their generated solutions through self-analysis.

## Main Idea
We propose developing self-critique AI agents that generate code, execute it against test cases, analyze failures, and refine solutions without human intervention. The agent would follow a cycle: generate code solution, execute it against test cases, perform detailed error analysis (identifying error types, root causes, and required fixes), generate explanations for its mistakes, and use this analysis to create an improved solution. This approach combines reinforcement learning from execution feedback with a novel self-reflection mechanism where the agent develops "cognitive models" of common programming errors and their solutions. By maintaining a memory of past errors and successful repairs, the agent builds a continuously improving error correction framework. This methodology could dramatically improve code reliability while reducing dependency on human feedback, potentially transforming autonomous programming capabilities and providing insights into how AI systems can effectively learn from their mistakes.
