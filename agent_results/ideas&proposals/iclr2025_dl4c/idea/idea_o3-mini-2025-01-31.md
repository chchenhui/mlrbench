Title: Human-in-the-Loop Post-Training for Code Alignment

Motivation:  
Current automated code generation systems often produce syntactically correct yet functionally misaligned code. Integrating human feedback after initial training can refine model outputs to match nuanced developer expectations. This improvement is crucial for increasing trust in AI-generated code and enhancing developer productivity.

Main Idea:  
We propose a post-training framework that incorporates human evaluations to align deep learning code generators with real-world coding practices. Initially, a pre-trained code model generates candidate code based on given prompts. Then, a small group of expert developers reviews the outputs, providing both binary correctness assessments and detailed annotations on code style, efficiency, and domain-specific requirements. These human signals are transformed into reward functions for reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, effectively aligning the modelâ€™s behavior with desired metrics. Concurrently, automatic evaluation via execution-based benchmarks corroborates human assessments, ensuring both subjective and objective quality improvements. Expected outcomes include higher quality, more context-aware code suggestions, and a reliable methodology for continuous model improvement. This approach paves the way for responsible AI practices in code generation by tightly integrating human expertise throughout the learning process.
