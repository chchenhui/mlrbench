Title: AlignCode: Multi-Feedback Post-Training for Reliable Code Generation

Motivation: State-of-the-art code models still produce buggy, insecure, or stylistically inconsistent code, requiring extensive developer review. We need a unified alignment framework that leverages diverse feedback sources—human, execution, and AI critiques—to substantially boost correctness, security, and style adherence in generated code.

Main Idea: We propose AlignCode, a three-stage post-training pipeline. (1) Human Feedback Tuning: Fine-tune a base code model using a curated dataset of human-rated code snippets, optimizing for readability and style. (2) Execution Feedback Loop: Generate candidate solutions on real-world coding tasks and compute unit-test–based rewards to reinforce correctness. (3) AI Critic Alignment: Use a model-based critic to evaluate architecture choices, security vulnerabilities, and documentation quality, feeding back scalar critiques for further policy gradient updates. We will evaluate on benchmarks like HumanEval, MBPP, and a newly curated “SecurityEval” of common vulnerability patterns. Expected outcomes include a measurable decrease in runtime errors, vulnerability disclosures, and style violations, leading to more trustworthy code generation models and higher developer productivity.
