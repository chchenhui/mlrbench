# Research Proposal: Contrastive Multi-Modal Alignment for Unified Material Representations  

# 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Materials discovery and design are critical for advancing technologies such as renewable energy, quantum computing, and sustainable manufacturing. The diversity of materials—ranging from crystalline solids and molecules to nanomaterials—demands the integration of heterogeneous data modalities, including atomic-level structural data, synthesis protocols, and characterization outputs (e.g., electron microscopy images). However, current machine learning approaches in materials science often focus on isolated modalities. For example, graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling atomic structures [1-4], while vision and language models are rarely applied to materials data despite their success in other domains [5]. This fragmentation limits the ability to uncover cross-modal correlations (e.g., how synthesis conditions influence atomic defects) and hinders holistic material understanding.  

**Research Objectives**  
We propose to develop **Contrastive Multi-Modal Alignment (COMMA)**, an AI framework that learns unified representations by aligning diverse material data modalities into a shared latent space. The core objectives are:  
1. To design a contrastive learning framework that integrates structural, textual (synthesis protocols), and visual (characterization images) data.  
2. To train modality-specific encoders—GNNs for structures, Transformers for text, and CNNs for images—while learning a contrastive loss that enforces alignment across modalities.  
3. To validate the superiority of COMMA over single-modality baselines in downstream tasks such as property prediction, synthesis recommendation, and defect identification.  

**Significance**  
COMMA addresses two key challenges outlined in the AI4Mat workshops [5]:  
1. **Building Foundation Models** by unifying multi-modal data, enabling transfer learning across material types (e.g., predicting properties of nanomaterials from molecular data).  
2. **Next-Generation Representations** by solving the open problem of material data fusion, risking overlooking key interdependencies that single-modality models cannot capture.  
This work has the potential to accelerate materials discovery significantly. For instance, Google DeepMind's GNoME framework already predicted 2.2 million materials [6], but incorporating COMMA's cross-modal understanding could further enhance discovery efficiency by correlating synthesis strategies with atomic-level outcomes.  

# 2. Methodology  

## 2.1 Architecture Design  
COMMA synthesizes three distinct modalities:  

### 2.1.1 Structural Encoder: 3D Graph Neural Networks  
We represent atomic structures as graphs $ G = (V, E) $, where nodes $ v_i \in V $ denote atoms with features $ \mathbf{h}_i^{(0)} $ (e.g., atomic number, charge) and edges $ e_{ij} \in E $ encode interatomic distances and bond types. We deploy a 3D-aware GNN architecture (inspired by [4]) that leverages invariant local descriptors to model spatial atomic interactions:  
$$
\mathbf{h}_i^{(l+1)} = \text{GNN}_{\text{struct}}^{(l)}\left( \mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}, \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \phi(\|\mathbf{r}_{ij}\|) \cdot \mathbf{h}_j^{(l)} \right),
$$
where $ \mathbf{r}_{ij} $ is the vector from atom $ i $ to neighbor $ j $, $ \phi(\cdot) $ is a learnable radial basis function, and $ \mathcal{N}(i) $ is the neighbor set of $ i $.  

### 2.1.2 Text Encoder: Hierarchical Transformer  
Synthesis protocols are encoded as text sequences $ \textbf{T} = [\texttt{token}_1, \dots, \texttt{token}_N] $. We use a hierarchical Transformer that combines BERT-style token encodings with attention over procedural steps (e.g., temperature, duration). The output is a global text embedding $ \mathbf{h}_{\text{text}} $.  

### 2.1.3 Image Encoder: Vision Transformer (ViT)  
Characterization images are processed using ViT [5], which divides images into patches and applies a self-attention mechanism to capture global patterns (e.g., defect structures in microscopy images). The class token $ \mathbf{h}_{\text{img}} $ serves as the image representation.  

## 2.2 Unified Representation via Contrastive Learning  
To align all modalities into a common latent space, we employ a modality-agnostic projection head $ \gamma(\cdot) $:  
$$
\mathbf{z}_{\text{struct}} = \gamma_{\text{struct}}(\mathbf{h}_{\text{struct}}), \quad
\mathbf{z}_{\text{text}} = \gamma_{\text{text}}(\mathbf{h}_{\text{text}}), \quad
\mathbf{z}_{\text{img}} = \gamma_{\text{img}}(\mathbf{h}_{\text{img}}).
$$  
The projection heads are trained with a **modality-invariant contrastive loss** $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{cmc}} $, which maximizes agreement between representations from the same material while minimizing agreement with negatives from other materials:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{cmc}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{z}_i^{\text{struct}}, \mathbf{z}_i^{\text{text}})/\tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{z}_i^{\text{struct}}, \mathbf{z}_k^{\text{text}})/\tau)} - \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{z}_i^{\text{text}}, \mathbf{z}_i^{\text{img}})/\tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{z}_i^{\text{text}}, \mathbf{z}_k^{\text{img}})/\tau)} + \mathbb{E}_{i,j \text{ mismatch}}[\text{log}(1 - \text{sim}(\mathbf{z}_i^{\text{struct}}, \mathbf{z}_j^{\text{img}}))],
$$  
where $ \text{sim}(\cdot, \cdot) $ is cosine similarity, $ \tau $ is a temperature parameter, and $ K $ is the number of negative samples.  

## 2.3 Data Collection and Preprocessing  

### 2.3.1 Datasets

- **Hardware**: Trained on 4$\times$NVIDIA A100 GPUs with mixed-precision acceleration.  
- **Optimization**: AdamW optimizer ($ \beta_1 = 0.9, \beta_2 = 0.999 $), batch size = 128, learning rate = $ 5 \times 10^{-4} $ for encoders, $ 1 \times 10^{-3} $ for projection heads.  
- **Training Schedule**:  
  1. Pretrain GNN and CNN encoders for 50 epochs on isolated modalities.  
  2. Fine-tune with $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{cmc}} $ for 100 epochs.  

### 2.4.2 Data Augmentation

- **Retrieval Tasks**: Recall@K (R@1, R@5, R@10).  

### 2.5.4 Ablation Studies  
- Compare with variants of $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{cmc}} $:  
  - No negative samples.  
  - Max-margin contrastive loss instead of InfoNCE.  
- Analyze the impact of each modality using ablation experiments (e.g., text-only + image-only vs. text + structure + image).  

# 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

## 3.1 Scientific Contributions  
1. **Unified Material Representations**: COMMA will generate the first open-source dataset of aligned cross-modal embeddings (e.g., structure→text→image triplets), which can serve as a foundation for future multi-modal foundation models.  
2. **Contrastive Learning Insights**: We expect to demonstrate that modality alignment improves learning efficiency by leveraging the "curriculum" of correlated data—e.g., noisy synthesis texts may be grounded via structural constraints.  
3. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: We hypothesize COMMA will achieve:  
   - Reduction in bandgap prediction RMSE by ≥15% vs. GNN baselines.  
   - ≥20% improvement in synthesis protocol retrieval R@1 over CLIP-style models.  

## 3.2 Broader Impact  
- **Accelerated Materials Discovery**: By linking synthesis strategies to atomic-level outcomes, COMMA can identify routes to synthesize novel materials (e.g., stable perovskites for photovoltaics) directly from text descriptions.  
- **Community Toolkits**: Release pre-trained COMMA models via existing frameworks (e.g., [DeepChem](https://deepchem.io/)) to lower barriers for cross-disciplinary research.  
- **Ethical Considerations**: While COMMA itself raises minimal ethical risks, the materials it enables—such as batteries for electric vehicles and carbon-capture catalysts—could contribute to climate mitigation efforts.  

## 3.3 Limitations and Future Work  
- **Scalability**: Current GNN layers may struggle with systems larger than 200 atoms; integrating hierarchical or message-passing variants could mitigate this.  
- **Missing Modalities**: COMMA assumes complete modality availability; future work will explore self-supervised imputation for incomplete data.  
- **Interpretability**: We will open-source visualization dashboards to help domain experts inspect which structural motifs or text terms drive cross-modal similarities.
