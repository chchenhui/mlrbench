**Title:** Contrastive Multi-Modal Alignment for Unified Material Representations

**Motivation:** Effectively representing materials requires integrating diverse data types like atomic structures, synthesis descriptions, and experimental characterization images. Current methods often struggle to fuse these heterogeneous modalities, limiting our ability to capture the complex interplay between structure, synthesis, and resultant properties/performance. This research aims to bridge this gap by learning unified representations from multi-modal material data.

**Main Idea:** We propose a framework utilizing contrastive learning to align representations from different material data modalities into a shared latent space. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) will encode structural information, while modality-specific encoders (e.g., Transformers for text, CNNs for images) will process synthesis protocols and characterization data. A contrastive loss function will encourage representations of the same material from different modalities to be similar, while pushing apart representations of different materials. The expected outcome is a powerful, unified embedding capturing cross-modal correlations, leading to improved performance on downstream tasks like property prediction, synthesis recommendation, and defect identification compared to single-modality approaches. This enables holistic material understanding by leveraging rich, multi-faceted datasets.
