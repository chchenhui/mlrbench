# Foundation Transformer: A Multi-Scale Representation Learning Framework for Materials Science

## Motivation
Current materials science foundation models often fail to address the complex, multi-scale nature of materials data. Atomic structures, electronic properties, and macroscopic behaviors all exist at different scales but are intrinsically connected. This fragmentation limits the unified understanding needed for accelerated materials discovery. Traditional representations typically focus on single scales, missing crucial cross-scale relationships that determine material functionality. A comprehensive representation learning framework that can seamlessly integrate information across multiple scales would dramatically enhance our ability to design materials for targeted applications and enable transfer learning across diverse materials domains.

## Main Idea
I propose "Foundation Transformer," a hierarchical transformer architecture that learns unified representations across atomic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic scales of materials data. The framework employs specialized encoders for each scale that feed into a cross-scale attention mechanism, enabling information flow between scales. The model would be pretrained on diverse materials datasets (crystallographic databases, electronic structure calculations, and experimental property measurements) using masked prediction objectives tailored to each scale. Key innovations include: (1) scale-aware positional embeddings that preserve physical relationships between scales, (2) physics-informed self-attention mechanisms that respect symmetry and conservation laws, and (3) a contrastive learning approach to align representations across scales. This framework would enable zero-shot property prediction, structure-property relationship mining, and serve as a foundation for downstream tasks like inverse design and synthesis planning.
