1. **Title**: Hierarchical Multimodal Graph Networks for Unified Materials Representation and Discovery  

2. **Motivation**: Current materials representations often fragment diverse data modalities (e.g., crystal structures, spectra, thermodynamic properties) and fail to capture cross-scale relationships (atoms to devices). This limits model generalization and transferability, hindering accelerated discovery of complex functional materials for applications like batteries or semiconductors. A holistic representation that integrates hierarchical multiscale features and dynamic data modalities is urgently needed to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world material systems.  

3. **Main Idea**: Propose a hierarchical multimodal graph neural network (HMGNN) framework that: (1) represents materials as nested graphs spanning atomic, molecular, and device-level scales; (2) employs cross-scale attention modules to propagate information between hierarchies; (3) incorporates physics-informed graph embeddings to encode domain knowledge (e.g., Coulombic forces, crystal symmetry); and (4) unifies heterogeneous data via multimodal fusion layers that balance interpretability and task flexibility. The model will be trained on diverse datasets (e.g., battery materials, catalytic molecules) using contrastive learning to align latent spaces across modalities. Expected outcomes include property-aware representations enabling zero-shot predictions for understudied materials and robust performance on small, noisy datasets. This could revolutionize materials discovery by enabling seamless transfer between applications and automating synthesis pathway predictions via interpretable latent features. Impact: A step toward end-to-end AI pipelines for materials design adaptable to emerging data types in high-throughput experiments.
