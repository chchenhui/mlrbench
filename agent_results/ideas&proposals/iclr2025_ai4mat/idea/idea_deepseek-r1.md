**Title:** Multi-Modal Contrastive Learning for Unified Materials Representation  

**Motivation:** Current materials representations often fail to integrate diverse data modalities (e.g., structural, electronic, synthesis parameters), limiting AI's ability to generalize across materials classes and real-world applications. A unified framework is needed to bridge modalities, address data sparsity, and enable robust downstream tasks like property prediction and discovery.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a contrastive learning framework that aligns heterogeneous materials data (e.g., crystal structures, spectroscopy, synthesis conditions) into a shared embedding space. Use modality-specific encoders (e.g., graph neural networks for structures, transformers for text-based synthesis protocols) and enforce similarity between embeddings of the same material across modalities via contrastive loss. To handle data scarcity, incorporate physics-informed regularization (e.g., symmetry constraints) and synthetic data augmentation. Expected outcomes include improved cross-modal retrieval accuracy and enhanced performance on tasks like bandgap prediction or stability classification. This approach could democratize access to multimodal materials data, accelerate discovery, and serve as a foundation for future materials-specific AI models.
