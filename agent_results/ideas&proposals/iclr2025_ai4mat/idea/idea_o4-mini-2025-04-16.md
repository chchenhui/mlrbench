Title: MultiMatFM – A Multi-Modal Foundation Model for Materials Discovery

Motivation:  
Current AI advances in language and vision rely on large foundation models, yet materials science lacks a unified model that integrates its diverse data forms—chemical compositions, crystal graphs, microscopy images, and spectral signatures. This fragmentation hampers model generalization and slows discovery pipelines.

Main Idea:  
We propose MultiMatFM, a self-supervised, multi-modal foundation model pre-trained on a massive corpus of materials entries comprising: (1) composition vectors, (2) crystal-structure graphs, (3) simulated and experimental X-ray/neutron diffraction patterns, and (4) microscopy/spectroscopy images. Architecture:  
• Encoders: Graph neural network for structure, Transformer for composition, CNN for images/spectra.  
• Pretraining tasks: cross-modal contrastive learning, masked node/patch prediction, and modality-reconstruction.  
After pretraining, MultiMatFM can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks—property prediction, inverse design, synthesis planning—achieving superior sample efficiency and transferability. Expected outcomes include unified embeddings that accelerate screening of novel materials and establish a community-driven foundation model for interdisciplinary collaboration.
