# **Research Proposal: Knowledge-Guided Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity and Constraint-Aware Synthetic Financial Time Series Generation**

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The financial sector is increasingly leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for diverse applications, including algorithmic trading, risk management, fraud detection, and personalized financial services (Workshop Call for Papers). However, the development and validation of robust AI models heavily depend on access to large-scale, high-quality data. Financial data, particularly time series such as transaction records, asset prices, and customer interactions, is often highly sensitive and subject to stringent privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and confidentiality agreements. This poses a significant barrier to research and innovation, especially for smaller institutions, startups, and academic researchers (Sattarov et al., 2023; White & Brown, 2024).

Synthetic data generation (SDG) has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these challenges, aiming to create artificial data that mimics the statistical properties of real data without revealing sensitive information (Green & Black, 2023). Various generative models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), have been explored for financial data synthesis (White & Brown, 2024). Recently, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), or diffusion models, have shown remarkable success in generating high-fidelity data, particularly in image synthesis, and are increasingly being adapted for time series and tabular data (Takahashi & Mizuno, 2024; Sattarov et al., 2023; Suh et al., 2024; Sikder et al., 2023; Blue & Red, 2024). These models learn to reverse a gradual noising process, allowing them to capture complex data distributions effectively. Existing works like those by Takahashi & Mizuno (2024) and Sattarov et al. (2023) demonstrate the potential of diffusion models for generating realistic financial time series and tabular data, respectively, focusing on capturing stylized facts and handling mixed data types.

However, a critical limitation of many current SDG methods, including standard diffusion models, is their difficulty in capturing the intricate temporal dependencies (Sikder et al., 2023) and enforcing domain-specific constraints inherent in financial systems (White & Brown, 2024; Purple & Yellow, 2023). Financial data is not merely statistical; it is governed by economic principles, market dynamics, causal relationships (e.g., interest rate changes affecting market volatility), and regulatory rules (e.g., Anti-Money Laundering (AML) transaction limits, capital adequacy requirements). Synthetic data that violates these fundamental constraints lacks realism and utility for downstream tasks like compliance testing, risk modeling, or strategy backtesting. While some recent works acknowledge the need for domain knowledge integration (Doe & Smith, 2024; Purple & Yellow, 2023), a systematic framework combining the generative power of diffusion models with explicit, structured domain knowledge for financial time series remains largely unexplored.

### 1.2 Research Gap and Proposed Solution
The primary research gap lies in the development of generative models for financial time series that simultaneously achieve high statistical fidelity *and* adhere to complex, real-world domain constraints. Existing diffusion models excel at distributional matching but are inherently agnostic to domain rules unless specifically conditioned. Conversely, methods focusing solely on rules might lack generative flexibility and fail to capture subtle statistical patterns.

This proposal introduces **Knowledge-Guided Diffusion Models (KDDM)**, a novel framework designed to generate high-fidelity synthetic financial time series data (e.g., asset prices, transaction streams) that respects domain-specific constraints encoded within a **Knowledge Graph (KG)**. Our core idea is to leverage the strengths of both diffusion models for capturing complex data distributions and KGs for representing structured domain knowledge. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) will be employed to process the KG and extract relevant contextual information, which will then guide or condition the denoising process of the diffusion model. This ensures that the generated sequences are not only statistically realistic but also compliant with encoded financial rules, regulations, and market behaviors.

### 1.3 Research Objectives
The main objectives of this research are:
1.  **Develop the KDDM Framework:** Design and implement a hybrid generative model integrating a diffusion model backbone with a KG and a GNN-based guidance mechanism for financial time series generation.
2.  **Construct Domain-Specific Financial Knowledge Graphs:** Build KGs encoding relevant relationships, rules, and constraints for specific financial use cases (e.g., transaction monitoring for AML, stock price dynamics considering market events).
3.  **Implement Knowledge-Guided Conditioning:** Investigate and implement effective mechanisms for conditioning the diffusion model's denoising process using the GNN-processed knowledge graph embeddings.
4.  **Rigorous Evaluation:** Evaluate the KDDM framework on benchmark and real-world (potentially anonymized) financial datasets. Assessment will cover:
    *   **Statistical Fidelity:** Comparing distributions, temporal dependencies (autocorrelations, volatility clustering), and stylized facts between real and synthetic data.
    *   **Constraint Adherence:** Quantifying the extent to which synthetic data satisfies the rules and constraints encoded in the KG.
    *   **Downstream Task Utility:** Assessing the performance of models (e.g., fraud classifiers, forecasting models) trained on synthetic data compared to those trained on real data.
    *   **Comparison with Baselines:** Benchmarking KDDM against standard diffusion models, other generative models (GANs, VAEs), and existing knowledge-integration techniques.

### 1.4 Significance
This research holds significant potential for advancing AI in finance responsibly. By enabling the generation of realistic and constraint-aware synthetic financial data, KDDM can:
*   **Democratize Access to Data:** Provide researchers and smaller institutions with high-quality, privacy-preserving data for model development and testing.
*   **Accelerate Innovation:** Facilitate faster prototyping and validation of AI models for applications like fraud detection, risk management, and algorithmic trading.
*   **Enhance Compliance and Risk Management:** Allow financial institutions to generate data reflecting specific regulatory scenarios or stress conditions for testing compliance systems and risk models (RegTech).
*   **Improve Model Robustness:** Generate diverse and challenging scenarios (e.g., rare fraud patterns respecting plausible transaction constraints) for training more robust AI systems.
*   **Promote Responsible AI:** Address ethical concerns related to data privacy and bias by providing a controlled environment for data generation and model testing, aligning with the workshop's focus on responsible AI.

Success in this research would contribute a novel methodology to the field of generative modeling and provide a valuable tool for the financial industry and research community, directly addressing key challenges highlighted in recent literature (White & Brown, 2024; Green & Black, 2023).

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Overall Framework
The proposed Knowledge-Guided Diffusion Model (KDDM) integrates three core components: a Diffusion Model backbone, a Financial Knowledge Graph (FKG), and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) linker.

*   **Diffusion Model Backbone:** This component learns the underlying distribution of the real financial time series data ($x_0$). We will adapt existing architectures suitable for time series, potentially leveraging Transformer-based backbones (Sikder et al., 2023) for capturing long-range dependencies or techniques for handling tabular time series aspects (Sattarov et al., 2023; Suh et al., 2024). The standard diffusion process involves a forward noising process $q$ that gradually adds Gaussian noise to the data over $T$ steps, and a reverse denoising process $p_\theta$ parameterized by a neural network $\epsilon_\theta$, which learns to predict the noise added at each step $t$.
    *   Forward Process: $q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)$, where $\beta_t$ are noise schedule variances.
    *   Reverse Process: $p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t))$, where $\mu_\theta$ and $\Sigma_\theta$ are learned. Typically, the network $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)$ predicts the noise $\epsilon$ added to obtain $x_t$ from $x_0$, allowing reconstruction of $x_{t-1}$.
*   **Financial Knowledge Graph (FKG):** This component explicitly encodes domain-specific knowledge. It will be represented as $G = (V, E, R)$, where $V$ is the set of entities (e.g., accounts, assets, transaction types, market events, regulatory thresholds), $E$ is the set of edges representing relationships $R$ between entities (e.g., `transacts_with`, `influenced_by`, `has_property`, `violates_rule`). The FKG structure and content will be tailored to the specific financial application (e.g., AML rules, market microstructure dependencies).
*   **GNN Linker:** A GNN (e.g., GraphSAGE, GAT) will process the FKG to generate node embeddings or a graph-level context vector $c_{KG} = \text{GNN}(G)$. These embeddings capture the relational information and constraints encoded in the graph. This approach draws inspiration from GNN applications in finance for capturing relationships (Johnson & Lee, 2023).
*   **Integration:** The core novelty lies in conditioning the diffusion model's reverse process on the KG information provided by the GNN. The noise prediction network becomes $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c_{KG})$, where $c_{KG}$ provides guidance. This guidance ensures the denoising steps are biased towards generating samples consistent with the knowledge encoded in the FKG.

### 2.2 Data Collection and Preparation
*   **Data Sources:** We aim to utilize both publicly available financial time series (e.g., stock prices from Yahoo Finance, cryptocurrency data) and, where possible, anonymized or synthetic datasets representative of real-world private data (e.g., transaction logs, credit card payments). Collaboration with financial institutions (subject to agreements and ethical approvals) might provide access to more realistic, albeit anonymized, data structures. For initial development, we may use existing financial synthetic data benchmarks or simulate data with known ground-truth constraints.
*   **Preprocessing:** Data will be preprocessed according to standard practices for time series analysis:
    *   Normalization/Standardization (e.g., z-score normalization).
    *   Handling Missing Values (e.g., imputation using temporal methods).
    *   Feature Engineering (e.g., calculating returns, volatility measures).
    *   Potential transformation into formats suitable for specific diffusion backbones (e.g., image-like representations via wavelet transforms as in Takahashi & Mizuno (2024), or handling mixed tabular types as in Sattarov et al. (2023)).
    *   Sequence Segmentation: Dividing long time series into overlapping or non-overlapping windows of fixed length suitable for the model input.

### 2.3 Financial Knowledge Graph Construction
*   **Knowledge Acquisition:** Domain knowledge will be gathered from diverse sources:
    *   Regulatory documents (e.g., AML guidelines, Basel Accords).
    *   Financial textbooks and research papers defining market dynamics and relationships.
    *   Expert knowledge from financial analysts or domain experts (if possible).
    *   Statistical analysis of the data itself to identify strong correlations or causal links (with caution to avoid spurious relations).
*   **Ontology Design:** Define entity types (e.g., `Account`, `Transaction`, `Asset`, `Rule`, `Event`) and relation types (e.g., `makesTransaction`, `exceedsLimit`, `correlatesWith`, `affectedBy`).
*   **Graph Population:** Instantiate the graph based on the specific target domain. For example, for AML-focused transaction generation:
    *   Entities: Accounts, High-Risk Country List, Transaction Types (cash deposit, wire transfer), Amount Thresholds.
    *   Relations: `Account(is_high_risk)`, `Transaction(involves_account)`, `Transaction(amount_exceeds)`, `Transaction(destination_country_is_high_risk)`.
*   **Tools:** Utilize standard KG construction tools (e.g., Neo4j, RDFLib) and potentially knowledge graph embedding techniques (e.g., TransE, ComplEx) if pre-trained embeddings are beneficial.

### 2.4 Knowledge-Guided Diffusion Process
Let $x_0$ be a sample financial time series sequence. The forward diffusion process $q(x_t|x_0)$ remains standard. The reverse process aims to learn $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t, c_{KG})$, conditioned on the knowledge graph context $c_{KG} = \text{GNN}(G)$.

**Conditioning Mechanisms:** We will explore several ways to integrate $c_{KG}$ into the denoising network $\epsilon_\theta$:
1.  **Input Concatenation:** Concatenate $c_{KG}$ (or relevant node embeddings from $c_{KG}$) with the noisy input $x_t$ and the time embedding $t$: $\epsilon_\theta([x_t, c_{KG}, t])$.
2.  **Cross-Attention:** Use a cross-attention mechanism where $x_t$ attends to the KG context $c_{KG}$, allowing the model to dynamically focus on relevant knowledge aspects during denoising. This is particularly useful if $c_{KG}$ is a set of node embeddings.
3.  **Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) / FiLM Layers:** Use $c_{KG}$ to predict scale ($\gamma$) and shift ($\beta$) parameters applied to intermediate activations within the diffusion U-Net/Transformer backbone: $Activation' = \gamma(c_{KG}) \odot Activation + \beta(c_{KG})$. This allows fine-grained control over the generation process based on the encoded knowledge.

**Training Objective:** The primary objective is the standard diffusion loss (simplified VLB objective):
$$ \mathcal{L}_{diffusion} = \mathbb{E}_{t \sim [1, T], x_0 \sim q(x_0), \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)} [||\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c_{KG})||^2] $$
where $x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon$, and $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{i=1}^t (1-\beta_i)$.

To explicitly enforce constraints during training, we can introduce an auxiliary **Constraint Loss** $\mathcal{L}_{constraint}$:
$$ \mathcal{L}_{constraint} = \mathbb{E}_{x_0^{synth} \sim p_\theta(x_0|c_{KG})} [ \sum_{k \in K} \omega_k \cdot \text{ViolationPenalty}(x_0^{synth}, \text{Rule}_k) ] $$
where $p_\theta(x_0|c_{KG})$ represents a fully generated sample (or an approximation like $x_0 \approx \hat{x}_0(x_t)$), $K$ is the set of critical constraints derived from the KG, $\text{Rule}_k$ represents the $k$-th constraint function (e.g., checking if a transaction amount exceeds a limit defined in KG), $\text{ViolationPenalty}$ is a differentiable function penalizing violations (e.g., hinge loss, squared error), and $\omega_k$ are weights for each constraint.

The final training objective becomes:
$$ \mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{diffusion} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{constraint} $$
where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter balancing fidelity and constraint satisfaction. Training involves sampling real data $x_0$, noise $\epsilon$, timestep $t$, computing $x_t$, querying the GNN for $c_{KG}$, predicting noise $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c_{KG})$, and potentially calculating the constraint loss on generated samples periodically.

**Generation (Sampling):** Starting from pure noise $x_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$, iteratively sample $x_{t-1} \sim p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t, c_{KG})$ using the learned denoising network $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c_{KG})$, guided by the KG context $c_{KG}$ derived from the GNN processing the FKG.

### 2.5 Experimental Design
*   **Datasets:**
    *   Public: S&P 500 daily/intraday prices, cryptocurrency (BTC/ETH) prices, potentially data from platforms like Kaggle related to credit card transactions (after careful review for anonymity).
    *   Synthetic Benchmarks: Generate data using simpler models (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH) with known parameters and stylised facts to test recovery.
    *   Targeted Private Data (Conceptual): Anonymized bank transaction streams, loan application data, or insurance claim sequences (collaboration-dependent). If real private data is unavailable, we will create semi-synthetic datasets by modifying public data to include specific constraints for testing.
*   **Baselines:**
    *   Standard Diffusion Models (without KG guidance): e.g., DDPM applied to time series, TimeGrad, potentially FinDiff (Sattarov et al., 2023) or TransFusion (Sikder et al., 2023) if applicable to the data format.
    *   Other Generative Models: TimeGAN, RC-GAN (Conditional GANs), VAEs for time series.
    *   Rule-Based Generation (Simple): Generate data purely based on rules, likely failing statistical fidelity.
    *   Existing Knowledge Integration methods (if available/reproducible): e.g., model from Doe & Smith (2024) if implementation details allow.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Statistical Fidelity:**
        *   *Distributional Metrics:* Wasserstein distance, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-values on marginal distributions of features (e.g., transaction amounts, price returns).
        *   *Temporal Metrics:* Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plots/distances for returns and squared returns (volatility clustering), Hurst Exponent (long-range dependency), stylised fact comparison (fat tails -Kurtosis).
        *   *Predictive Metrics:* Train a simple forecasting model (e.g., LSTM) on synthetic data and evaluate on real data (Train Synthetic Test Real - TSTR). (as in Suh et al., 2024)
        *   *Dimensionality Reduction:* t-SNE/UMAP visualizations comparing embeddings of real vs. synthetic sequences.
    *   **Constraint Adherence:**
        *   Define quantitative metrics based on the FKG rules. E.g., Percentage of generated transactions correctly adhering to AML velocity limits; Percentage of generated price series satisfying minimum liquidity constraints; Average deviation from known economic relationships encoded in the KG.
    *   **Downstream Task Utility:**
        *   *Classification Task:* Train a fraud detection model (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM-Autoencoder) using (1) Real data only, (2) KDDM synthetic data only, (3) Combined Real + KDDM data. Evaluate F1-score, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR on a held-out real test set.
        *   *Forecasting Task:* Train a price/volatility forecasting model using the same three data scenarios. Evaluate using MAE, RMSE.
    *   **Computational Efficiency:** Measure training time and sampling time, comparing KDDM with baselines.
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    *   **Impact of KG:** Compare full KDDM vs. the diffusion backbone alone (no KG/GNN).
    *   **Impact of GNN Architecture:** Test different GNN layers (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE).
    *   **Impact of Conditioning Mechanism:** Compare input concatenation vs. cross-attention vs. AdaLN/FiLM.
    *   **Impact of Constraint Loss:** Evaluate the effect of varying $\lambda$ in $\mathcal{L}_{total}$ on the trade-off between fidelity and constraint adherence.

*   **Enabling Financial AI Research:** By providing a means to generate realistic and valid synthetic data, KDDM can lower the barrier to entry for researchers, fostering innovation in areas currently hampered by data scarcity. This directly addresses the challenge of data accessibility (White & Brown, 2024).
*   **Improving Financial Risk Management and Compliance:** Financial institutions can use KDDM to generate tailored datasets for stress testing, scenario analysis ('what-if' simulations respecting market rules), and validating compliance monitoring systems under diverse conditions, improving robustness and potentially reducing regulatory burden (FinTech/RegTech innovation). This directly addresses the need for incorporating domain knowledge (Doe & Smith, 2024; Purple & Yellow, 2023).
*   **Enhancing AI Model Training:** Synthetic data from KDDM can augment real data, particularly for rare events (e.g., sophisticated fraud patterns, market crashes), potentially leading to more robust and accurate AI models for detection and prediction. It helps address complex temporal dependencies and stylized facts (Takahashi & Mizuno, 2024; Sikder et al., 2023) while respecting rules.
*   **Promoting Responsible AI in Finance:** By generating privacy-preserving data that adheres to ethical and regulatory guidelines encoded in the KG, KDDM supports the development and deployment of responsible AI systems in finance, aligning with the workshop's theme. It tackles the utility vs. privacy challenge (Green & Black, 2023; Sattarov et al., 2023) by focusing on utility enhancement through constraint adherence.
*   **Standardizing Evaluation:** The proposed rigorous evaluation framework, including specific metrics for constraint adherence, can contribute to better standards for assessing synthetic financial data quality, addressing a noted challenge (White & Brown, 2024).

In summary, the proposed research on Knowledge-Guided Diffusion Models offers a promising pathway to generate highly realistic and compliant synthetic financial time series data. By bridging the gap between powerful generative models and essential domain knowledge, this work aims to unlock significant potential for innovation, robustness, and responsibility in the rapidly evolving landscape of financial AI.
