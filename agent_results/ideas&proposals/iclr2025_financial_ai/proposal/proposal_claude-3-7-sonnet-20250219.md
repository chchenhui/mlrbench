# Knowledge-Guided Diffusion Models for Generating High-Fidelity Synthetic Financial Time-Series

## 1. Introduction

Financial institutions increasingly rely on data-driven approaches for critical operations including risk assessment, fraud detection, investment strategies, and regulatory compliance. However, the highly sensitive nature of financial data presents significant challenges, with strict regulatory frameworks like GDPR, CCPA, and industry-specific regulations limiting data sharing and utilization. These constraints create substantial barriers to innovation, research collaboration, and model development.

Financial time-series data presents unique modeling challenges due to its distinctive characteristics: complex temporal dependencies, heterogeneous variables, non-stationarity, regime shifts, and domain-specific constraints (e.g., market rules, regulatory requirements). Existing synthetic data generation approaches often fail to capture these nuanced properties, resulting in synthetic datasets with limited utility for downstream financial applications.

Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promising results in generating high-quality synthetic data across various domains. These models, which learn to gradually denoise data through an iterative process, have demonstrated remarkable ability to capture complex distributions. Simultaneously, knowledge graphs have emerged as powerful tools for encoding domain expertise, relationships, and constraints in structured formats. The integration of these two approaches presents a compelling opportunity for financial time-series generation.

### Research Objectives

1. Develop a novel framework that combines diffusion models with domain-specific knowledge graphs to generate synthetic financial time-series data that faithfully represents real-world patterns while adhering to financial constraints and regulations.

2. Design mechanisms to incorporate domain knowledge into the diffusion process, ensuring generated sequences maintain statistical fidelity while respecting financial rules and causal relationships.

3. Establish comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess the quality, utility, and constraint adherence of the generated financial time-series across multiple financial domains (trading, transactions, risk indicators).

4. Demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic data for downstream financial applications, including anomaly detection, forecasting, and risk modeling.

### Significance

This research addresses a critical gap in financial AI development by enabling the generation of high-quality, privacy-preserving synthetic data that captures the complex temporal dynamics and domain-specific constraints of financial markets. Successful implementation would yield several important benefits:

1. **Democratization of Financial AI Research**: Creating open, realistic financial datasets would enable broader academic participation in financial AI research without requiring access to proprietary data.

2. **Enhanced Privacy Protection**: Financial institutions could utilize synthetic data for model development and testing without exposing sensitive client information.

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Generated data that inherently respects regulatory constraints would facilitate compliance-by-design in AI development.

4. **Improved Model Testing**: Realistic synthetic data would allow for robust testing of financial models across diverse market scenarios, including rare events that may be underrepresented in historical data.

5. **Cross-Institutional Collaboration**: Organizations could share synthetic data representations of their unique datasets, enabling collaborative model development while maintaining data privacy.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed methodology integrates knowledge graphs with diffusion models through a novel architecture called KG-FinDiff (Knowledge Graph-guided Financial Diffusion). The approach consists of four main components:

### 2.1 Financial Domain Knowledge Graph Construction

We will construct a comprehensive knowledge graph encoding three types of financial domain knowledge:

1. **Regulatory and Logical Constraints**: Rules governing valid financial sequences (e.g., settlement periods, trading hours, price limits).

2. **Temporal Dependencies**: Typical patterns, seasonalities, and correlations in financial time-series.

3. **Causal Relationships**: Market dynamics and factor relationships that influence financial variables.

The knowledge graph $G = (V, E, R)$ consists of:
- Vertices $V$ representing financial entities and concepts
- Edges $E$ representing relationships between entities
- Relation types $R$ capturing the nature of connections

Each vertex $v_i \in V$ may represent financial instruments, market events, or economic indicators. Edges $e_{ij} \in E$ connect related vertices with relation types $r_k \in R$ that specify the nature of relationships (e.g., "influences," "constrains," "precedes").

The knowledge graph will be constructed using a combination of:
- Expert-defined rules from financial regulations and market mechanics
- Data-driven relationship extraction from historical financial data
- Integration of existing financial ontologies and taxonomies

### 2.2 Knowledge-Guided Diffusion Model Architecture

Our diffusion model builds upon recent advances in time-series diffusion models but incorporates knowledge guidance through a novel mechanism. The core process follows the diffusion model framework:

1. **Forward Process**: Gradually add Gaussian noise to financial time-series data $x_0$ through $T$ timesteps according to:

$$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \beta_t\mathbf{I})$$

where $\beta_t$ is the noise schedule, producing a sequence $x_0, x_1, ..., x_T$ with $x_T$ approaching pure noise.

2. **Reverse Process**: Learn to denoise through a parameterized model that estimates the reverse transitions:

$$p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t))$$

The innovation in our approach comes from integrating knowledge graph guidance into the denoising network through the following mechanisms:

#### 2.2.1 Graph Neural Network Encoder

We employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode the knowledge graph into latent representations that can guide the diffusion process:

$$h_v^{(l+1)} = \text{UPDATE}\left(h_v^{(l)}, \text{AGGREGATE}\left(\{h_u^{(l)}, r_{uv} : u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\}\right)\right)$$

where $h_v^{(l)}$ is the representation of node $v$ at layer $l$, $\mathcal{N}(v)$ denotes the neighbors of $v$, and $r_{uv}$ is the relation type between nodes $u$ and $v$.

After $L$ layers of message passing, we obtain knowledge embeddings $H_G = \{h_v^{(L)} : v \in V\}$ that capture the structure and relationships in the financial domain.

#### 2.2.2 Knowledge-Conditioned Denoising Network

The denoising network incorporates both the current noisy sample and relevant knowledge embeddings:

$$\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c_t) = \text{UNet}(x_t, t, c_t)$$

where $c_t$ is a context vector derived from the knowledge graph embeddings relevant to the current denoising step:

$$c_t = \text{Attention}(q_t, H_G)$$

with $q_t$ being a query vector derived from the current noisy sample $x_t$ and diffusion timestep $t$.

#### 2.2.3 Constraint Enforcement Mechanism

To ensure generated sequences adhere to hard constraints encoded in the knowledge graph, we introduce a constraint enforcement layer in the sampling process:

$$\hat{x}_{t-1} = \mu_\theta(x_t, t) + \sigma_t z$$

$$x_{t-1} = \text{Project}(\hat{x}_{t-1}, \mathcal{C})$$

where $z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$, and $\text{Project}(\cdot, \mathcal{C})$ projects the sample onto the constraint set $\mathcal{C}$ derived from the knowledge graph.

### 2.3 Data Preparation and Model Training

#### 2.3.1 Data Sources and Preprocessing

We will utilize multiple financial time-series datasets:
- Market price data (stocks, bonds, derivatives) with varying frequencies
- Transaction and payment data (anonymized and aggregated)
- Economic indicators and market microstructure data

Preprocessing steps include:
1. Normalization and alignment of time-series data
2. Feature engineering to capture domain-specific properties
3. Wavelet transformations to represent multi-scale temporal patterns
4. Segmentation of long time-series into manageable sequences

#### 2.3.2 Training Procedure

The model training follows an end-to-end procedure with the following loss function:

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{diffusion}} + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{KG}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{adversarial}}$$

where:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{diffusion}} = \mathbb{E}_{t,x_0,\epsilon}\left[\|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c_t)\|_2^2\right]$$

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{KG}} = \mathbb{E}_{x_0, G}\left[\text{KL}(p_G(x_0) \| p_\theta(x_0))\right]$$

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{adversarial}} = \mathbb{E}_{x_0}\left[\log D(x_0)\right] + \mathbb{E}_{z}\left[\log(1 - D(G_\theta(z)))\right]$$

The hyperparameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ balance the different loss components. $\mathcal{L}_{\text{KG}}$ enforces consistency with knowledge graph constraints, while $\mathcal{L}_{\text{adversarial}}$ employs a discriminator $D$ to further improve the realism of generated samples.

Training will utilize a curriculum learning approach, gradually increasing the complexity of constraints and temporal dependencies that the model must capture.

### 2.4 Experimental Design and Evaluation
