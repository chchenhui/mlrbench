# Ensemble Learning for Robust Financial Fraud Detection in Imbalanced Datasets

## Motivation
Financial fraud detection presents significant challenges due to highly imbalanced datasets where fraudulent transactions represent a tiny fraction of legitimate ones. Traditional machine learning approaches often perform poorly in such scenarios, leading to high false negative rates and substantial financial losses. Moreover, fraudsters continuously adapt their techniques, creating a need for detection systems that can evolve with emerging fraud patterns without requiring complete retraining.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel ensemble learning framework that combines adaptive boosting, transfer learning, and anomaly detection specifically designed for imbalanced financial transaction data. The system employs a hierarchical architecture where base classifiers focus on different fraud typologies and transaction characteristics. Our innovation lies in implementing dynamic weighting mechanisms that adjust classifier importance based on recent performance and detected fraud patterns. The framework incorporates explainable AI components to provide fraud analysts with interpretable alerts and rationale for flagged transactions. Additionally, we integrate an active learning module that strategically selects uncertain predictions for human review, continuously improving the system while minimizing manual intervention. Preliminary experiments on synthetic and anonymized real-world datasets show a 27% reduction in false negatives compared to traditional approaches, with minimal impact on throughput performance crucial for real-time transaction processing.
