**Title**: Knowledge-Driven Diffusion Models for Generation of High-Fidelity Synthetic Financial Time-Series  

**Motivation**: Financial institutions face significant challenges in accessing high-quality, privacy-compliant data for training AI models due to regulatory restrictions and data sensitivity. Existing synthetic data generation methods often fail to capture complex temporal dependencies and domain-specific constraints (e.g., regulatory rules, market dynamics), limiting their utility. Creating realistic, customizable synthetic time-series data could democratize AI research in finance while enabling safe innovation.  

**Main Idea**: Propose a hybrid framework combining **diffusion models** and **domain-specific knowledge graphs** to generate synthetic financial time-series (e.g., transaction logs, asset prices, fraud patterns) that adhere to real-world constraints. The knowledge graph encodes regulatory rules, temporal correlations, and causal market relationships, which guide the diffusion process via a graph neural network (GNN) during training. This ensures synthetic sequences satisfy domain-specific validity (e.g., anti-money laundering rules, liquidity constraints). Methodologically, the diffusion model learns to reverse noise injected into real datasets while respecting knowledge graph-guided priors. Evaluation will focus on statistical fidelity (e.g., distributional similarity to real data), constraint adherence, and downstream task performance (e.g., fraud detection model training). Success could enable open financial datasets for research, reduce privacy risks, and foster compliance-ready AI development. Potential impact includes accelerating progress in financial anomaly detection, risk modeling, and algorithmic trading while addressing ethical and regulatory concerns.
