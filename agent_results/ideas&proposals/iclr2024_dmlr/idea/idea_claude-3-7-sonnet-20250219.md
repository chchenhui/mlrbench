# Data Streams for Foundation Models: A Continuous Learning Approach

## Motivation
Foundation models are typically trained on massive but static datasets, leading to challenges with data drift and relevance over time. As real-world data distributions constantly evolve, models can quickly become outdated. Current approaches largely ignore the temporal dimension of data, focusing instead on one-time large-scale collection. This research addresses the critical need for continual data integration systems that maintain foundation model relevance while minimizing retraining costs.

## Main Idea
We propose a dynamic data streaming framework for foundation models that continuously monitors, evaluates, and integrates new data sources. The system employs three interconnected components: 1) A drift detection mechanism using distributional shifts to identify when new data patterns emerge; 2) An adaptive sampling strategy that prioritizes novel, high-quality data points while maintaining representation of existing concepts; and 3) A progressive integration pipeline that enables efficient model updating through selective retraining on strategically curated data subsets. 

Rather than viewing dataset construction as a static process, our approach treats data as a continuous stream requiring ongoing curation. This enables foundation models to evolve alongside changing real-world conditions while preserving performance on core tasks. We anticipate this methodology will significantly extend model relevance periods, reduce maintenance costs, and provide a framework for sustainable model development across domains.
