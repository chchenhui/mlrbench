**Title:** A Quality-Aware Framework for Model-Assisted Construction of Scientific Datasets

**Motivation:** Building large-scale foundation models for scientific domains (e.g., genomics, materials science) is hampered by the scarcity and high cost of curated, labeled data. Leveraging vast unlabeled scientific literature and experimental data requires effective methods to identify and structure high-quality information relevant for model training.

**Main Idea:** We propose a framework where a foundation model bootstraps the creation of domain-specific datasets. Initially trained on readily available unlabeled text (papers, reports) and structured data, the model identifies potentially valuable information nuggets (e.g., experimental results, property correlations) using uncertainty quantification and relevance scoring. These candidate nuggets are presented to domain experts via an efficient HCI interface for verification/correction. The verified data is used to fine-tune the model, improving its ability to identify higher-quality data in subsequent iterations. This human-in-the-loop, model-assisted approach aims to significantly accelerate the construction of high-quality, large-scale scientific datasets while incorporating expert knowledge.
