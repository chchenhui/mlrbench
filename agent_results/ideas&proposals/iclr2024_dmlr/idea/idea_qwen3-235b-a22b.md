1. **Title:** *"Self-Evolving Dataset Curation via Foundation Model Feedback Loops"*  

2. **Motivation:**  
Scaling datasets for foundation models often introduces noise, bias, and ethical risks, degrading model performance and trustworthiness. Manual data curation is infeasible at scale, and existing automated methods lack contextual awareness. This research addresses the critical need for intelligent, scalable systems that dynamically refine datasets using foundation models' own capabilities, improving both data quality and model robustness.  

3. **Main Idea:**  
Propose a closed-loop framework where foundation models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models) autonomously evaluate and refine their training data during pre-training. The model generates quality signals (e.g., coherence, toxicity, diversity) via self-supervised tasks or auxiliary probes, using its own representations to iteratively reweight or filter samples. For example, a language model might score text documents for fluency and bias using its masked language modeling head, while a vision model could identify mislabeled or low-quality images through contrastive learning signals. These signals feed into a dynamic curation pipeline, enabling the model to "teach itself" by reinforcing high-quality data and down-weighting harmful or irrelevant examples. Expected outcomes include improved model accuracy, reduced bias, and faster training. This approach reduces human annotation effort and creates ethical, adaptive datasets that align with evolving model capabilities. Impact spans safer AI development and robust foundation models for real-world deployment.
