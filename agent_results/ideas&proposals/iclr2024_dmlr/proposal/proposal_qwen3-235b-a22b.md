# Title: Uncertainty-Driven Model-Assisted Curation for Multi-Domain Foundation Models  

# Introduction  

## Background  
The paradigm of machine learning is undergoing a transformative shift from model-centric to data-centric approaches, particularly in the era of large-scale foundation models (FMs). While architectural innovations dominated early research, recent advances emphasize the critical role of data quality, diversity, and curation in achieving robust, generalizable models across domains such as vision, language, and Earth observation (Zha et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024). Despite this recognition, the creation of high-quality, multi-domain datasets remains a costly and error-prone endeavor. Manual annotation pipelines often struggle to scale, while automated methods risk introducing biases or overlooking domain-specific nuances (Bhat et al., 2023).  

A key challenge lies in efficiently allocating scarce human annotation resources. Existing model-assisted curation pipelines suffer from two critical limitations: (1) overwhelming curators with trivial or redundant samples due to naive sampling strategies, and (2) failing to dynamically adapt to evolving uncertainty patterns in unlabeled data (Liu et al., 2025). These issues are compounded in multi-domain scenarios, where models must balance exploration of underrepresented domains with exploitation of high-impact samples to mitigate dataset shift (Jiang et al., 2024).  

## Research Objectives  
This proposal introduces **UMC** (Uncertainty-driven Model-assisted Curation), a novel framework for iterative dataset construction that synergizes predictive uncertainty estimation, human-in-the-loop feedback, and adaptive resource allocation. The core objectives are:  
1. **To develop a principled uncertainty quantification mechanism** for multi-domain FMs using ensemble-based confidence metrics and inter-model disagreement.  
2. **To design an interactive curation interface** that prioritizes human annotation of high-uncertainty, high-disagreement samples across diverse domains.  
3. **To implement a multi-armed bandit allocator** that dynamically balances exploration (new domains) and exploitation (hard samples) under budget constraints.  
4. **To validate the framework** on cross-domain benchmarks spanning vision, language, and multimodal data, demonstrating significant reductions in annotation costs and improved robustness to dataset shift.  

## Significance  
By addressing critical gaps in data-centric AI research, UMC has the potential to:  
- Reduce annotation costs by 30–50% compared to baseline methods (e.g., random sampling, naive uncertainty sampling).  
- Enhance FM robustness through explicit modeling of domain-specific uncertainty patterns.  
- Enable scalable, domain-aware dataset construction for emerging applications in Earth observation (Najjar et al., 2024), biomedical NLP (Bojic et al., 2023), and beyond.  
- Advance the theoretical foundations of uncertainty estimation in cross-domain settings, bridging the gap between data quality metrics and model performance (Tschalzev et al., 2024).  

# Methodology  

## Overview  
UMC operates as an iterative pipeline (Figure 1) comprising four stages: (1) uncertainty scoring via ensemble models, (2) clustering of uncertain examples, (3) human-in-the-loop annotation, and (4) model retraining with updated uncertainty estimates. A multi-armed bandit (MAB) allocator dynamically adjusts sampling priorities to optimize annotation efficiency.

## Data Curation Pipeline  

### 1. Ensemble Uncertainty Scoring  
Let $ \mathcal{D}_{\text{unlabeled}} $ denote the unlabeled dataset spanning $ K $ domains. We initialize UMC with a diverse ensemble of $ M $ pre-trained domain specialists:  
$$
\mathcal{E} = \left\{ f^{(1)}_\theta, f^{(2)}_\theta, \dots, f^{(M)}_\theta \right\}
$$
Each $ f^{(m)}_\theta $ is a foundation model fine-tuned on a distinct domain (e.g., medical imaging, satellite data, legal text).  

For each $ x \in \mathcal{D}_{\text{unlabeled}} $, we compute two uncertainty signals:  
- **Predictive confidence**:  
$$
\text{Confidence}(x) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \max_{y} p^{(m)}(y|x)
$$
- **Inter-model disagreement** (via average KL-divergence):  
$$
\text{Disagreement}(x) = \frac{1}{M^2} \sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{m'=1}^M D_{\text{KL}}\left(p^{(m)}(y|x) \parallel p^{(m')}(y|x)\right)
$$  
These metrics are combined into a composite uncertainty score:  
$$
\mathcal{U}(x) = \alpha \cdot (1 - \text{Confidence}(x)) + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \text{Disagreement}(x)
$$
where $ \alpha \in [0,1] $ balances confidence vs. disagreement contributions.  

### 2. Clustering High-Uncertainty Samples  
We extract the top-$ N $ uncertain samples using $ \mathcal{U}(x) $ and project them into a reduced-dimensional space via UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018). Hierarchical clustering (using Ward linkage) identifies dense regions of uncertain examples, ensuring diversity in the annotation batch.  

### 3. Interactive Annotation Interface  
The clustered samples are presented to human curators through an interface inspired by active learning tools (Saveliev et al., 2025). Features include:  
- Visual clustering cues to guide domain-specific annotations.  
- Confidence intervals for model predictions to contextualize annotator decisions.  
- Feedback hooks to refine uncertainty metrics based on labeling consistency.  

### 4. Model Retraining  
The augmented dataset $ \mathcal{D}_{\text{labeled}} \leftarrow \mathcal{D}_{\text{labeled}} \cup \mathcal{D}_{\text{human-verified}} $ is used to fine-tune the foundation model $ f_{\theta} $. Uncertainty estimates are updated for the entire unlabeled pool.  

## Resource Allocation via Multi-Armed Bandits  
To balance exploration and exploitation, we model domains $ \{d_k\}_{k=1}^K $ as arms of a contextual bandit (Li et al., 2010). The allocator selects a domain $ d_k $ at each iteration using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategy:  
$$
\text{UCB}(d_k) = \bar{\mathcal{U}}(d_k) + \beta \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\log T}{n_k}}
$$  
where $ \bar{\mathcal{U}}(d_k) $ is the mean uncertainty score for domain $ k $, $ n_k $ is the number of samples annotated in $ d_k $, and $ T $ is the total number of annotated samples. The hyperparameter $ \beta $ controls exploration intensity.  

## Experimental Design  

### Datasets  
We evaluate UMC on:  
- **Vision**: DomainNet (5 domains: real, sketch, painting, quickdraw, infograph)  
- **Language**: BioASQ (biomedical Q&A) and LegalBench (legal text classification)  
- **Multimodal**: EuroSAT-Geo (satellite imagery + metadata)  

### Baselines  
- **Random Sampling**  
- **Margin-based Uncertainty Sampling** (Scheffer et al., 1997)  
- **Core-Set Selection** (Sener & Savarese, 2018)  
- **BADGE** (Ash et al., 2020): Diverse gradient embeddings  

### Evaluation Metrics  
1. **Annotation Efficiency**: Accuracy at 10%/25%/50% labeled budget.  
2. **Robustness**: Performance drop on drifted test sets (generated via domain mixing).  
3. **Domain Coverage**: Mean average precision (mAP) for domain-specific retrieval.  
4. **Labeler Productivity**: Time per correctly annotated sample.  

### Statistical Analysis  
We perform 5×5 cross-validation and use Nemenyi tests for multiple comparisons.  

# Expected Outcomes & Impact  

## Expected Outcomes  
1. **Quantifiable Cost Reduction**: UMC is expected to achieve ≥30% fewer annotations than baselines to reach equivalent performance, validated via hypothesis testing ($ p < 0.01 $).  
2. **Improved Robustness**: On drifted test sets, UMC-FMs will exhibit ≤10% accuracy degradation compared to ≥20% for baselines, demonstrating superior domain generalization.  
3. **Enhanced Domain Coverage**: Clustering-based curation should improve mAP by ≥15% for domain-specific retrieval tasks.  

## Scientific and Societal Impact

2. **Practical Benefits**: Accelerated curation pipelines will lower barriers for multi-domain FM adoption in high-stakes domains like healthcare (Bojic et al., 2023) and environmental monitoring (Najjar et al., 2024).  
3. **Ethical Governance**: By focusing annotator effort on critical samples, UMC reduces redundant data collection, mitigating privacy risks and computational waste.  

## Benchmark Contributions
