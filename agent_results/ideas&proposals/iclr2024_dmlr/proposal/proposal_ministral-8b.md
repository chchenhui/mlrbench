# Uncertainty-Driven Model-Assisted Curation for Multi-Domain Foundation Models

## 1. Introduction

### Background

The advent of large-scale foundation models has revolutionized the landscape of machine learning, particularly in domains like vision and language. While model architecture has been the traditional focus of research, recent advancements have shifted the spotlight towards the importance of data quality, size, and diversity, as well as data provenance. The quality and diversity of data are critical determinants of the performance and generalization capabilities of foundation models. However, building large-scale datasets across diverse domains is a costly and error-prone process. Current model-assisted curation pipelines either overwhelm human annotators with low-value samples or miss domain-specific nuances, thereby hindering the efficient and effective construction of high-quality datasets.

### Research Objectives

This research aims to develop a novel, uncertainty-driven model-assisted curation (UMC) pipeline to address the challenges in large-scale dataset construction. The primary objectives are:

1. **Efficient Data Curation**: To guide human annotators towards high-impact examples with model-estimated uncertainty, thus accelerating the curation process and improving data quality.
2. **Domain Coverage**: To ensure broad domain coverage by dynamically balancing exploration (new domains) and exploitation (hard samples) of data.
3. **Cost Reduction**: To achieve a 30–50% reduction in annotation costs by focusing on high-priority samples.
4. **Model Robustness**: To enhance the robustness of foundation models to dataset shifts by incorporating diverse and high-quality data.

### Significance

The significance of this research lies in its potential to address the critical challenges in data-centric machine learning by providing a scalable and efficient method for curating high-quality datasets. By integrating uncertainty estimation and human-in-the-loop approaches, UMC can significantly improve the performance and generalization capabilities of foundation models, making them more robust and versatile across various domains.

## 2. Methodology

### Research Design

The UMC pipeline consists of four iterative stages: data scoring, sample selection, human annotation, and model retraining. Additionally, a multi-armed bandit allocator dynamically balances exploration and exploitation to optimize labeling budgets.

#### 2.1 Data Scoring

In the initial stage, a diverse ensemble of pre-trained domain specialists is deployed to score unlabeled data. Each model scores the data based on predictive confidence and inter-model disagreement. The scoring mechanism can be mathematically represented as follows:

\[ \text{Score}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \text{Confidence}(x, M_i) - \text{Disagreement}(x, M_i) \right) \]

Where:
- \( x \) is the unlabeled sample.
- \( M_i \) is the \( i \)-th model in the ensemble.
- \( \text{Confidence}(x, M_i) \) is the predictive confidence of model \( M_i \) on sample \( x \).
- \( \text{Disagreement}(x, M_i) \) is the disagreement between model \( M_i \) and other models in the ensemble.

#### 2.2 Sample Selection

Low-confidence or high-disagreement samples are clustered using a clustering algorithm such as K-means or DBSCAN. These clusters are then routed to human curators through an interactive interface for annotation. The selection of samples for human annotation can be optimized using a multi-armed bandit algorithm to balance exploration and exploitation:

\[ \theta_t = \theta_{t-1} + \alpha \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Reward}(i) - \mu \right) \]

Where:
- \( \theta_t \) is the allocation parameter at time \( t \).
- \( \alpha \) is the learning rate.
- \( n \) is the number of arms (samples).
- \( \text{Reward}(i) \) is the reward obtained from annotating sample \( i \).
- \( \mu \) is the mean reward.

#### 2.3 Human Annotation

Human annotators review and annotate the selected samples through an interactive interface. The interface provides context and guidance based on the model's uncertainty estimates, aiding in the accurate and efficient annotation process.

#### 2.4 Model Retraining

The annotated data is used to retrain the foundation models, enhancing their performance and robustness. The retraining process can be represented as follows:

\[ \mathbf{W} \leftarrow \mathbf{W} + \eta \nabla_{\mathbf{W}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{W}; \mathcal{D}_{\text{annotated}}) \]

Where:
- \( \mathbf{W} \) are the model parameters.
- \( \eta \) is the learning rate.
- \( \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{W}; \mathcal{D}_{\text{annotated}}) \) is the loss function on the annotated data.
- \( \mathcal{D}_{\text{annotated}} \) is the annotated dataset.

#### 2.5 Uncertainty Estimation Update

After retraining, the uncertainty estimates for the remaining pool of unlabeled data are updated, and the process is repeated.

### Experimental Design

To validate the UMC pipeline, the following experimental design is proposed:

#### 2.5.1 Datasets

The experiments will be conducted on several public datasets in both vision and language domains, including:

- **ImageNet** for vision tasks.
- **SQuAD** and **GLUE** for language tasks.

The performance of the UMC pipeline will be evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Annotation Cost**: The total cost of human annotation, measured in terms of time and resources.
- **Model Performance**: The performance of the foundation models on validation and test sets, measured using standard metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and BLEU score.
- **Dataset Shift Robustness**: The model's performance on datasets with different distributions to assess robustness to dataset shifts.
- **Domain Coverage**: The diversity and breadth of the domains covered by the annotated data.
