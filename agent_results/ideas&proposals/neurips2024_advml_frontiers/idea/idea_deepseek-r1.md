**Title:** Cross-Modal Adversarial Gradient Alignment for Robust Multimodal Learning  

**Motivation:** Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, but their cross-modal integration introduces unique vulnerabilities. Adversarial attacks targeting one modality (e.g., perturbing images) can propagate errors to text-based outputs, compromising reliability. Current defense strategies often address single modalities in isolation, leaving LMMs exposed to cross-modal adversarial threats. This research aims to close this gap by developing robust defenses that account for multimodal interactions.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a novel adversarial training framework, **Cross-Modal Gradient Alignment (CMGA)**, to enhance LMM robustness by synchronizing gradient signals across modalities. The method involves (1) generating adversarial perturbations that exploit cross-modal dependencies (e.g., perturbing images to induce text misclassifications) via joint gradient analysis, (2) aligning these gradients during training to minimize conflicting optimization directions, and (3) integrating contrastive learning to disentangle modality-specific and shared adversarial patterns. CMGA will be evaluated on benchmarks like CLIP and GPT-4V, measuring robustness against cross-modal attacks (e.g., image-to-text hijacking) and downstream task performance. Expected outcomes include improved adversarial resilience without sacrificing generalization. This work addresses a critical gap in securing LMM deployments and provides insights into the interplay between modality fusion and adversarial vulnerability, advancing both AdvML theory and real-world AI safety.
