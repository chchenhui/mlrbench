**Cross-Modal Adversarial Immunization: A Framework for Enhancing Large Multimodal Model Robustness Against Multi-Domain Attacks**

## 2. Introduction

**Background**

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has culminated in the development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), sophisticated systems capable of processing and integrating information from multiple modalities, such as vision and language (e.g., Radford et al., 2021; Alayrac et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023). These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks like visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and multimodal reasoning, driving innovation across diverse domains including autonomous systems, healthcare diagnostics, content filtering, and human-computer interaction. However, their increasing complexity and deployment in safety-critical applications raise significant concerns regarding their robustness and security.

Adversarial Machine Learning (AdvML) has emerged as a critical field studying the vulnerabilities of ML models to malicious inputs crafted by adversaries (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Szegedy et al., 2013). While initially focused on single-modality models (primarily vision), the advent of LMMs introduces new attack surfaces. A particularly concerning threat is the *cross-modal adversarial attack*, where a perturbation introduced in one modality (e.g., an imperceptible change to an image) induces a targeted error or failure in another modality (e.g., causing the model to generate incorrect text or follow harmful instructions). Recent studies, like those exploring universal adversarial images bypassing alignment safeguards [2] or targeted attacks minimizing embedding deviations [3], underscore the practical reality and potency of these threats. Such vulnerabilities arise from the intricate ways LMMs learn to align and fuse representations from different data streams, creating exploitable integration points [9, 5]. Existing defense mechanisms often inherit techniques from single-modal setups or focus on specific attack types like jailbreaking [1], potentially leaving LMMs inadequately protected against the broader spectrum of cross-modal threats that exploit inter-modal dependencies. Prior work has explored cross-modal attacks from images to videos [4] and evaluated general cross-modal vulnerabilities [9, 5], highlighting the need for dedicated defenses. Some recent efforts propose defenses based on consistency [6] or adaptivity [7], or specific adversarial training methods [8], but a comprehensive framework integrating these ideas to achieve holistic cross-modal robustness remains an open challenge.

**Research Objectives**

This research aims to address the critical vulnerability of LMMs to cross-modal adversarial attacks by proposing and developing a novel defensive framework termed "Cross-Modal Adversarial Immunization" (CMAI). CMAI is designed to proactively strengthen LMMs by enforcing and verifying consistency between modal representations, even under adversarial conditions. The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop a Cross-Modal Consistency Verification (CMCV) module:** Design and implement a module capable of dynamically assessing the semantic alignment between representations derived from different input modalities within an LMM. This module will serve as a core component for detecting potential cross-modal attacks or inconsistencies.
2.  **Design Modality-Bridging Adversarial Training (MBAT):** Formulate and implement a novel adversarial training strategy that explicitly generates adversarial perturbations targeting the cross-modal interaction points. This involves crafting attacks that maximize cross-modal inconsistency, thereby training the model to maintain alignment under duress.
3.  **Create an Adaptive Robustness Mechanism (ARM):** Develop a mechanism that leverages the output of the CMCV module to dynamically adjust the model's defensive posture. This could involve modulating the adversarial training process or adapting inference-time strategies based on detected anomaly levels.
4.  **Integrate CMAI Components into LMMs:** Combine the CMCV, MBAT, and ARM components into a unified CMAI framework that can be integrated with existing LMM architectures with minimal structural modifications.
5.  **Empirically Validate CMAI:** Rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the CMAI framework against a diverse range of state-of-the-art cross-modal adversarial attacks using standard LMM benchmarks. The evaluation will focus on quantifying improvements in robust accuracy while ensuring minimal impact on performance with benign inputs and assessing computational overhead.

**Significance**

This research directly addresses key challenges outlined in the AdvML-Frontiers workshop call, specifically focusing on "Adversarial threats on LMMs," "Cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs," and "Defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs." The proposed CMAI framework offers several significant contributions:

1.  **Enhanced Security for LMMs:** By focusing on cross-modal consistency, CMAI aims to provide a more fundamental and potentially more generalizable defense mechanism compared to strategies tailored only tospecific attack vectors or modalities. This is crucial for deploying LMMs safely in high-stakes applications like autonomous driving [10], medical analysis, and secure content generation.
2.  **Novel Defensive Paradigm:** The integration of consistency verification, targeted adversarial training across modalities, and adaptive defense introduces a novel, multi-faceted approach to LMM robustness. This moves beyond simple extensions of single-modality defenses.
3.  **Advancing AdvML Research:** This work will contribute to a deeper understanding of cross-modal vulnerabilities and the mechanisms by which they can be mitigated. The development of MBAT will also provide new tools for probing and evaluating LMM robustness.
4.  **Practical Applicability:** CMAI is designed for integration into existing LMM architectures, potentially offering a practical pathway for enhancing the robustness of currently deployed or near-deployment systems without requiring complete model redesigns.
5.  **Addressing Ethical Concerns:** By hardening LMMs against adversarial manipulation, this research contributes to mitigating the risk of misuse, such as generating disinformation or bypassing safety filters via cross-modal exploits, thus supporting the development of more ethical and trustworthy AI systems.

## 3. Methodology

This section details the proposed research design, including the conceptual framework, algorithmic components, data requirements, experimental validation plan, and evaluation metrics.

**Overall Framework: Cross-Modal Adversarial Immunization (CMAI)**

The CMAI framework aims to immunize LMMs against cross-modal attacks by integrating three key components: Cross-Modal Consistency Verification (CMCV), Modality-Bridging Adversarial Training (MBAT), and an Adaptive Robustness Mechanism (ARM). We assume a typical LMM architecture with separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., vision encoder $E_v$, text encoder $E_t$) whose outputs are fused and processed by a joint multimodal component $F$ to produce the final output $y$. Let $h_v = E_v(x_v)$ and $h_t = E_t(x_t)$ be the intermediate representations for visual input $x_v$ and textual input $x_t$.

**Component 1: Cross-Modal Consistency Verification (CMCV)**

*   **Purpose:** To quantify the semantic alignment between representations from different modalities ($h_v, h_t$) before or during fusion. High inconsistency might indicate a natural misalignment or, more critically, an adversarial perturbation affecting one modality disproportionately.
*   **Mechanism:** We propose learning a distance or similarity function that operates on the modality-specific representations, potentially after projection into a shared latent space.
    *   Let $P_v: \mathbb{R}^{d_v} \to \mathbb{R}^{d_s}$ and $P_t: \mathbb{R}^{d_t} \to \mathbb{R}^{d_s}$ be projection heads (e.g., MLPs) mapping the original representations $h_v$ and $h_t$ to a shared embedding space of dimension $d_s$.
    *   The consistency score $S_c$ can be defined using a similarity metric $Sim$, for example, cosine similarity:
        $$ S_c(x_v, x_t) = Sim(P_v(h_v), P_t(h_t)) = \frac{P_v(E_v(x_v)) \cdot P_t(E_t(x_t))}{||P_v(E_v(x_v))||_2 ||P_t(E_t(x_t))||_2} $$
    *   Alternatively, CMCV could be implemented as a dedicated verification network $V_{verify}$ trained contrastively (e.g., using InfoNCE loss) on aligned and misaligned cross-modal pairs during pre-training or fine-tuning, outputting a probability of consistency. $S_c(x_v, x_t) = V_{verify}(h_v, h_t)$.
*   **Training:** The projection heads $P_v, P_t$ (or the verifier $V_{verify}$) can be trained jointly with the main LMM task, potentially using an auxiliary contrastive loss that encourages representations from corresponding modalities (e.g., an image and its caption) to be closer than those from non-corresponding pairs.

**Component 2: Modality-Bridging Adversarial Training (MBAT)**

*   **Purpose:** To explicitly train the LMM to maintain cross-modal consistency and correct task performance even when faced with adversarial perturbations designed to disrupt inter-modal relationships.
*   **Mechanism:** MBAT extends standard adversarial training (e.g., PGD-AT by Madry et al., 2018) to the multimodal setting with a modified objective function. Instead of only maximizing the task loss $L_{task}$, the adversary also aims to maximize the cross-modal *inconsistency*, measured via the CMCV module or a related metric.
    *   Consider an attack perturbing the visual modality $x_v$ with $\delta_v$, constrained within an $\epsilon$-ball $S_v = \{\delta | ||\delta||_p \le \epsilon\}$. The adversarial perturbation $\delta_v^*$ is found by solving:
        $$ \delta_v^* = \arg \max_{\delta_v \in S_v} \left[ \alpha L_{task}(F(E_v(x_v+\delta_v), E_t(x_t)), y) - \beta S_c(x_v+\delta_v, x_t) \right] $$
        where $y$ is the ground truth label/output, $\alpha > 0$ and $\beta > 0$ are hyperparameters balancing the task objective and the consistency objective. Maximizing the negative consistency score ($-S_c$) corresponds to maximizing inconsistency. $L_{task}$ could be cross-entropy loss for classification/VQA or sequence generation loss for captioning.
    *   The perturbation $\delta_v^*$ is found using iterative gradient-based methods like Projected Gradient Descent (PGD):
        $$ \delta_v^{(k+1)} = \Pi_{S_v} \left( \delta_v^{(k)} + \eta \cdot \text{sign}(\nabla_{\delta_v^{(k)}} [\alpha L_{task} - \beta S_c]) \right) $$
        where $\eta$ is the step size, and $\Pi_{S_v}$ projects the perturbation back onto the allowed set $S_v$. A similar process can be defined for perturbing the text modality $x_t$.
*   **Training Procedure:** During LMM training, batches will consist of both clean examples $(x_v, x_t, y)$ and adversarial examples $(x_v+\delta_v^*, x_t, y)$ generated via MBAT. The overall training loss combines the standard task loss on clean data and the task loss on adversarial data:
    $$ L_{total} = (1-\lambda) L_{task}(F(E_v(x_v), E_t(x_t)), y) + \lambda L_{task}(F(E_v(x_v+\delta_v^*), E_t(x_t)), y) $$
    where $\lambda \in [0, 1]$ balances clean and robust training. The parameters of $E_v, E_t, F, P_v, P_t$ (and potentially $V_{verify}$) are updated based on $L_{total}$.

**Component 3: Adaptive Robustness Mechanism (ARM)**

*   **Purpose:** To dynamically adjust the model's defense level based on the likelihood of a cross-modal attack, as indicated by the CMCV module.
*   **Mechanism (Training):** The ARM can influence the MBAT process. If the average consistency score $S_c$ for a batch drops significantly below a threshold $\tau_c$ or exhibits high variance, it might indicate the current defense level ($\epsilon$, $\beta$, $\lambda$) is insufficient. ARM could dynamically adjust these parameters, e.g., increase the perturbation budget $\epsilon$ or the consistency weight $\beta$ for subsequent training steps.
    $$ \text{if } \text{avg}(S_c) < \tau_c \text{ then } \beta \leftarrow \min(\beta + \Delta\beta, \beta_{max})$$
*   **Mechanism (Inference):** At inference time, the CMCV score $S_c(x_v, x_t)$ for an incoming sample pair can be computed. If $S_c$ falls below a pre-defined threshold $\tau_{infer}$, the ARM could:
    *   Trigger a rejection option (outputting "cannot process" or "uncertain").
    *   Employ a more computationally intensive but potentially more robust inference pathway (e.g., averaging predictions over multiple slightly perturbed inputs, using model ensembling if available).
    *   Shift internal model parameters or activation functions towards a pre-trained 'robust' regime.
    *   Flag the input for human review in critical applications.

**Data Collection and Datasets**

We will use standard, publicly available datasets commonly used for evaluating LMMs. These include:
*   **Visual Question Answering (VQA):** VQAv2 dataset (Goyal et al., 2017). Requires images (COCO) and text questions.
*   **Image Captioning:** MS COCO Captions dataset (Lin et al., 2014). Requires images and text captions.
*   **Multimodal Reasoning:** NLVR2 dataset (Suhr et al., 2019). Requires pairs of images and text statements.
*   **Multimodal Alignment / Retrieval:** Flickr30k (Plummer et al., 2015) or COCO datasets could be used for tasks evaluating image-text retrieval robustness.

These datasets provide paired image-text data suitable for training the LMMs and evaluating performance on standard downstream tasks. No new data collection is required.

**Experimental Design**

1.  **Baseline Models:** We will select representative open-source LMM architectures (e.g., variants based on ViT-GPT, CLIP-based models, or models like LLaVA/MiniGPT-4) as base models for integrating CMAI. We will establish performance baselines using:
    *   The original LMM architecture without any defenses.
    *   The LMM trained with standard single-modality adversarial training (e.g., PGD-AT on the vision encoder only).
    *   Implementations of relevant recent defense methods where possible, such as ProEAT [1] (if code becomes available and adaptable) or methods based on principles from [6] or [8] if details allow faithful reproduction.

2.  **Attack Scenarios:** We will evaluate robustness against a comprehensive suite of cross-modal attacks:
    *   **Existing Cross-Modal Attacks:** Implementations based on recent literature [2, 3, 5], focusing on attacks perturbing one modality (e.g., vision) to cause failure in the other (e.g., text generation, VQA answer). Include attacks targeting alignment [2] and embedding space manipulation [3].
    *   **Adaptive White-Box Attacks:** Design PGD-based attacks specifically targeting the CMAI framework, including attacks that aim to maximize task loss while *minimizing* inconsistency detection (i.e., fooling the CMCV module). These attacks will assume full knowledge of the model architecture and parameters, including the CMAI components.
    *   **Transfer Attacks:** Evaluate robustness against attacks generated on the baseline models (without CMAI) to assess black-box robustness.
    *   **Attack Types:** Include both targeted attacks (forcing a specific incorrect output) and untargeted attacks (forcing any incorrect output). Consider $L_\infty$ and $L_2$ norm constraints for perturbations.

3.  **Evaluation Protocol:**
    *   **Training:** Train baseline models and CMAI-enhanced models on the selected datasets (e.g., VQAv2 training set). Hyperparameters for CMAI ($\alpha, \beta, \lambda, \epsilon$, PGD steps, CMCV architecture) will be tuned using a validation set.
    *   **Benign Evaluation:** Measure standard task performance (e.g., VQA accuracy, BLEU/CIDEr for captioning) on the clean test set.
    *   **Robust Evaluation:** Measure task performance on the test set perturbed by the different attack scenarios described above. Report Robust Accuracy (accuracy under attack) and Attack Success Rate (ASR) reduction compared to undefended models.
    *   **Ablation Studies:** Systematically evaluate the contribution of each CMAI component by training and testing models with different combinations: (i) Base LMM + CMCV only (for detection analysis), (ii) Base LMM + MBAT only, (iii) Base LMM + CMCV + MBAT, (iv) Full CMAI (CMCV + MBAT + ARM). This isolates the impact of consistency verification, targeted training, and adaptivity.
    *   **Consistency Analysis:** Track the CMCV score ($S_c$) distribution on clean vs. adversarial data for models trained with and without CMAI components. Successful CMAI should result in higher consistency scores ($S_c$) for adversarial examples compared to undefended models under the same attack.
    *   **Computational Cost:** Measure the training time overhead and inference latency introduced by the CMAI components compared to the baseline LMM.

**Evaluation Metrics**

*   **Primary Metrics:**
    *   **Clean Accuracy (Acc_clean):** Standard task metric (e.g., VQA accuracy, BLEU/CIDEr) on original, unperturbed test data.
    *   **Robust Accuracy (Acc_robust):** Standard task metric on test data perturbed by specific adversarial attacks.
*   **Secondary Metrics:**
    *   **Attack Success Rate (ASR):** Percentage of originally correctly classified examples that are misclassified after an attack. Lower ASR indicates better robustness.
    *   **Cross-Modal Consistency Score (S_c):** Average and distribution of the CMCV score on clean and adversarial datasets.
    *   **Computational Overhead:** Increase in training time per epoch and inference time per sample compared to the baseline.
    *   **Transferability ASR:** ASR of attacks generated on one model architecture when transferred to another (especially relevant for black-box scenarios).
