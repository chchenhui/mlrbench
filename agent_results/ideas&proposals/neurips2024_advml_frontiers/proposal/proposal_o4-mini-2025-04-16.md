1. Title  
Cross-Modal Adversarial Immunization: Strengthening Large Multimodal Models Against Multi-Domain Attacks  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Adversarial machine learning has exposed critical vulnerabilities in high‐capacity models by demonstrating that tiny perturbations—imperceptible to humans—can cause drastic misbehavior. While single‐modality defenses (e.g., image‐based adversarial training) have matured, the rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) such as CLIP, Flamingo, BLIP and PaLI has opened new “cross-modal” attack surfaces. An adversary may introduce a barely noticeable pixel-level perturbation in an image and cause an LMM to hallucinate unsafe text, or craft a malicious prompt that poisons the visual reasoning pipeline. In safety-critical domains (autonomous driving, medical diagnostics, content filtering), such cross-modal exploits carry high risk.  

Recent work has begun to characterize these vulnerabilities. Dou et al. (2024) showed that embedding alignment can be broken by optimizing an image to shift downstream text answers (the “CrossFire” attack). Rahmatullaev et al. (2025) demonstrated universal visual triggers that bypass multimodal alignment across queries. Conversely, emerging defenses (White et al., 2023; Red et al., 2024; Black et al., 2024) propose cross-modal consistency training and adaptive weighting. However, a unified framework that (i) systematically verifies cross-modal alignment, (ii) enforces robustness at the integration points, and (iii) adapts to diverse attack patterns in real time is still missing.  

Research Objectives and Significance  
The goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive defense framework—Cross-Modal Adversarial Immunization (CMAI)—that “immunizes” LMMs against multi-domain adversarial attacks while preserving performance on benign inputs. Our contributions are threefold:  
  • Cross-Modal Consistency Verification (CMCV) module that monitors alignment between modalities and flags misalignments.  
  • Modality-Bridging Adversarial Training (MBAT) that explicitly generates and trains against adversarial perturbations targeting cross-modal transfer points.  
  • Adaptive Robustness Mechanism (ARM) that dynamically redistributes defensive resources according to the detected attack signature.  

CMAI will integrate seamlessly with existing LMM architectures, incur modest computation overhead, and yield robust performance across vision–language tasks. By providing a generalizable methodology, this work aims to set a new standard for LMM security in research and industry.  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Overview  
Our defense framework comprises three interacting components (Figure 1):  
  1. Cross-Modal Consistency Verification (CMCV)  
  2. Modality-Bridging Adversarial Training (MBAT)  
  3. Adaptive Robustness Mechanism (ARM)  

We embed these components into the training loop of an arbitrary LMM $f_\theta$ with visual encoder $f^v_\theta$ and text encoder $f^t_\theta$.  

3.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
We will evaluate on widely used multimodal benchmarks:  
  • MSCOCO (image captioning, retrieval)  
  • VQA v2.0 (visual question answering)  
  • NLVR2 (visual reasoning)  

For each dataset, we prepare:  
  – Benign pairs $(x_v,x_t,y)$ where $x_v$ is an image, $x_t$ a prompt or caption, $y$ the ground‐truth.  
  – Adversarial sets generated by state-of-the-art cross-modal attacks (CrossFire, universal triggers, I2V transfers).  

All inputs are normalized and tokenized according to the underlying LMM architecture.  

3.3 Cross-Modal Consistency Verification (CMCV)  
CMCV enforces alignment between visual and textual feature spaces under both benign and adversarial conditions. Given representations  
  $$
  \mathbf{v} = f^v_\theta(x_v),\quad \mathbf{t} = f^t_\theta(x_t),
  $$  
we compute a cross-modal similarity score  
  $$
  S(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{t}) \;=\; \frac{\langle \mathbf{v},\,\mathbf{t}\rangle}{\|\mathbf{v}\|\;\|\mathbf{t}\|}\,.
  $$  
Under benign inputs, we enforce  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{cmc}}(\theta) \;=\; \mathbb{E}_{(x_v,x_t)}\bigl[\,\ell_{\mathrm{cons}}\bigl(S(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{t}),1\bigr)\bigr],
  $$  
where $\ell_{\mathrm{cons}}(s,1)=-(1-s)\log s$ is a consistency loss encouraging $S$ near 1. At inference time, CMCV flags any test pair whose $S(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{t})<\tau$ for further inspection or trigger adversarial remediation.  

3.4 Modality-Bridging Adversarial Training (MBAT)  
We cast robust training as a min–max optimization:  
  $$
  \min_\theta \;\mathbb{E}_{(x_v,x_t,y)\sim\mathcal D}\Bigl[\;\max_{\|\delta_v\|\le\epsilon_v,\,\|\delta_t\|\le\epsilon_t}\!\bigl\{\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{task}}\bigl(f_\theta(x_v+\delta_v,x_t+\delta_t),y\bigr)\;+\;\lambda\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{cmc}}(\theta)\bigr\}\Bigr].
  $$  
Here:  
  • $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{task}}$ is the downstream objective (e.g., cross‐entropy for classification, autoregressive loss for captioning).  
  • $\epsilon_v,\epsilon_t$ bound perturbation norms in each modality ($\|\delta_v\|_\infty\le\epsilon_v$, token‐level $\|\delta_t\|_2\le\epsilon_t$ via embedding‐space attacks or synonym replacements).  
  • $\lambda$ balances cross‐modal consistency regularization.  

Attack Generation  
  – Visual adversary: we apply projected gradient descent (PGD) on input pixels:  
    $$
    \delta_v^{(k+1)} \;=\;\mathrm{Proj}_{\|\delta\|\le\epsilon_v}\bigl(\delta_v^{(k)}+\alpha_v\,\mathrm{sign}\bigl(\nabla_{\delta_v}\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{task}}\bigr)\bigr).
    $$  
  – Textual adversary: we optimize word embeddings or apply discrete synonym replacements guided by gradient saliency.  
  – Cross‐modal perturbations: to directly target the bridging points, we optimize a composite loss  
    $$
    \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{bridge}} = \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{task}} + \gamma\,\bigl|\! \langle f^v_\theta(x_v+\delta_v),f^t_\theta(x_t)\rangle - \langle f^v_\theta(x_v),f^t_\theta(x_t+\delta_t)\rangle \bigr|.
    $$  
    This encourages misalignment in one modality to induce failings in the other.  

Implementation Details  
  – We leverage mixed‐precision training and gradient accumulation to handle the increased cost of inner‐loop attacks.  
  – We warm‐start from an off‐the‐shelf LMM and fine‐tune only selected layers to limit compute.  

3.5 Adaptive Robustness Mechanism (ARM)  
ARM monitors incoming examples and dynamically reallocates defense budget based on detected threat type. Concretely:  
  1. At inference, for each $(x_v,x_t)$ compute:  
     – Consistency score $S(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{t})$.  
     – Anomaly ranks based on input gradients or hidden‐state fluctuations.  
  2. Assign a modality‐weight vector $(w_v,w_t)$ via a small gating network $g_\phi$:  
     $$
     (w_v,w_t) = g_\phi\bigl(S(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{t}),\,\|\nabla_{x_v}\mathcal{L}\|,\,\|\nabla_{x_t}\mathcal{L}\|\bigr),
     $$  
     where $w_v+w_t=1$.  
  3. Re‐evaluate the example with a stronger adversarial‐defense pass on the prioritized modality.  

ARM is trained offline by simulating diverse attack patterns and learning $\phi$ to minimize a weighted robust loss.  

3.6 Experimental Design  
Baselines  
  • Standard training (no defense).  
  • Single‐modality adversarial training.  
  • ProEAT (Lu et al., 2025), Cross-Modal Adversarial Training (Red et al., 2024), Adaptive Defense (Black et al., 2024).  

Evaluation Metrics  
  • Benign accuracy / BLEU / CIDEr (for captioning).  
  • Robust accuracy under targeted and untargeted cross-modal attacks.  
  • Cross-modal consistency gap:  
    $$
    \Delta S = \mathbb{E}\bigl[S(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{t})_{\mathrm{benign}}-S(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{t})_{\mathrm{adv}}\bigr].
    $$  
  • Detection rate and false‐alarm rate for CMCV.  
  • Computational overhead (training/inference time).  

Ablation Studies  
  – Vary $\lambda$ and $\gamma$ to study the trade‐off between robustness and clean performance.  
  – Turn off CMCV or ARM to isolate each component’s contribution.  
  – Test on out‐of‐distribution data (e.g., unseen object classes, domain‐shifted images).  

Statistical Analysis  
  – Report mean and standard deviation over five random seeds.  
  – Use paired t‐tests to assess significance ($p<0.05$).  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We expect CMAI to achieve the following:  
  1. **Substantial Robustness Gains**  
     – Increase robust accuracy against cross-modal attacks by 15–25% over the strongest existing defenses while sacrificing less than 2% clean accuracy.  
     – Reduce the cross-modal consistency gap $\Delta S$ by at least 30%.  

  2. **Efficient Detection**  
     – CMCV will detect 90% of adversarial examples with a false‐alarm rate under 5%.  
     – ARM will correctly identify attack modality in over 85% of cases.  

  3. **Generalizability**  
     – The framework will transfer to diverse LMM architectures (CLIP, BLIP, Flamingo) with minimal re‐engineering.  
     – Performance will hold under black‐box and adaptive white‐box threat models.  

Impact  
By delivering a unified, modular defense strategy, CMAI will:  
  • Elevate the security baseline for vision–language systems in sensitive applications (autonomous navigation, healthcare diagnostics, social media moderation).  
  • Provide open‐source implementations and pre‐trained robust checkpoints to benefit both academic and industry practitioners.  
  • Stimulate new research in adaptive, cross-modal defenses and inspire benchmarks for immunization of future multimodal agents.  

In the long term, this work aims to shift the community’s mindset from single‐modality adversarial hardening toward fully integrated multimodal resilience, ensuring that the next generation of AI systems remains reliable, safe, and trustworthy even under concerted adversarial pressure.
