1. **Title**: Adversarial Training for Multimodal Large Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks (arXiv:2503.04833)
   - **Authors**: Liming Lu, Shuchao Pang, Siyuan Liang, Haotian Zhu, Xiyu Zeng, Aishan Liu, Yunhuai Liu, Yongbin Zhou
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces ProEAT, an adversarial training framework designed to defend multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against jailbreak attacks. ProEAT employs a projector-based architecture to efficiently manage large-scale parameters and incorporates a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism to optimize loss function allocation. The framework also implements a joint optimization strategy across visual and textual modalities to enhance resistance to attacks originating from either modality. Extensive experiments demonstrate ProEAT's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art defense performance with minimal reduction in clean accuracy.

2. **Title**: Universal Adversarial Attack on Aligned Multimodal LLMs (arXiv:2502.07987)
   - **Authors**: Temurbek Rahmatullaev, Polina Druzhinina, Matvey Mikhalchuk, Andrey Kuznetsov, Anton Razzhigaev
   - **Summary**: The authors propose a universal adversarial attack on multimodal large language models (LLMs) that utilizes a single optimized image to bypass alignment safeguards across various queries and models. By backpropagating through the vision encoder and language head, they craft a synthetic image that induces the model to produce targeted or unsafe content, even for harmful prompts. The method achieves high attack success rates and demonstrates cross-model transferability, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current multimodal alignment.

   - **Authors**: Zhihao Dou, Xin Hu, Haibo Yang, Zhuqing Liu, Minghong Fang
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces CrossFire, an approach to attack multi-modal models by transforming a targeted input into the modality of the original media and minimizing the angular deviation between their embeddings. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets reveal that CrossFire significantly manipulates downstream tasks, surpassing existing attacks. The study also evaluates six defensive strategies against CrossFire, finding current defenses insufficient to counteract the proposed attack.

   - **Authors**: Zhipeng Wei, Jingjing Chen, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang
   - **Summary**: The authors investigate the transferability of adversarial perturbations across different modalities, specifically from images to videos. They propose the Image To Video (I2V) attack, which generates adversarial frames by minimizing the cosine similarity between features of pre-trained image models from adversarial and benign examples, then combines these frames to perform black-box attacks on video recognition models. Experiments demonstrate high attack success rates, shedding light on the feasibility of cross-modal adversarial attacks.

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Cross-Modal Vulnerabilities**: Multimodal models are susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit the integration points between different modalities, leading to errors in one modality triggered by perturbations in another.

2. **Efficient Adversarial Training**: Developing adversarial training methods that efficiently handle the large-scale parameters of multimodal models without compromising computational feasibility remains a significant challenge.

3. **Maintaining Performance on Benign Inputs**: Ensuring that defensive strategies enhance robustness against adversarial attacks while preserving the model's performance on non-adversarial inputs is a delicate balance to achieve.

4. **Adaptive Defense Mechanisms**: Creating adaptive defense mechanisms that can dynamically adjust to various cross-modal attack patterns in real-time is crucial for the resilience of multimodal systems.

5. **Evaluation of Defense Strategies**: Comprehensively evaluating the effectiveness of proposed defense strategies against a wide range of cross-modal adversarial attacks is essential to validate their robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios.
