# DPFairLLM: Differentially Private and Fair Tabular Data Synthesis via Constrained Large Language Models

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool across various high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and education. However, the development and deployment of trustworthy ML models face significant challenges related to data availability, privacy concerns, and fairness considerations. High-quality training datasets are essential for robust ML model development, yet many real-world applications encounter limitations in data access due to scarcity, privacy regulations, or inherent biases in collected data.

Tabular data, which represents information in rows and columns with complex relationships between features, is particularly prevalent in sensitive domains. For example, healthcare records, financial transactions, and educational assessments are typically structured as tabular data. Generating synthetic tabular data that maintains the utility of real data while addressing privacy concerns and mitigating biases represents a significant research opportunity.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating a wide variety of content, including structured data formats. Their ability to capture complex patterns and generate coherent outputs presents a promising approach for synthetic tabular data generation. However, naively applying LLMs to sensitive data synthesis carries risks of memorization and privacy leakage, as well as perpetuating or amplifying societal biases present in training data.

Differential privacy (DP) offers a mathematically rigorous framework for quantifying and limiting privacy risks in data analysis and machine learning, while fairness constraints can help ensure that generated data does not reinforce existing biases against protected groups. Combining these concepts with the generative power of LLMs represents a novel approach to address the key challenges in synthetic data generation.

### Research Objectives

This research aims to develop a novel framework, DPFairLLM, for generating high-utility tabular synthetic data using constrained large language models that simultaneously provides:

1. Strong differential privacy guarantees to protect individual privacy
2. Fairness assurances to mitigate bias against protected groups
3. High fidelity and utility for downstream machine learning tasks

Specifically, the objectives of this research are:

1. To design and implement a fine-tuning approach for LLMs that incorporates differential privacy mechanisms and fairness constraints
2. To develop a mathematical framework for quantifying the privacy-utility-fairness trade-offs in synthetic data generation
3. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach across diverse tabular datasets and downstream tasks
4. To compare the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches for synthetic data generation

### Significance

The significance of this research lies in its potential to address three critical challenges in machine learning applications:

1. **Data Scarcity**: By generating high-fidelity synthetic tabular data, our approach can help overcome limitations in data availability, especially for rare conditions or underrepresented groups.

2. **Privacy Protection**: The incorporation of differential privacy guarantees will allow data owners to share synthetic versions of sensitive datasets with reduced privacy risks, thereby facilitating broader access to data for research and development.

3. **Bias Mitigation**: By explicitly addressing fairness during the generation process, our approach can help reduce biases in synthetic data, leading to more equitable ML models trained on such data.

If successful, this research will contribute to the broader goal of democratizing access to high-quality, privacy-preserving, and fair data resources for machine learning research and applications. This has particular relevance in high-stakes domains where data access is currently restricted due to privacy concerns or where existing data carries significant biases that affect underrepresented groups.

## 2. Methodology

The proposed methodology consists of four main components: (1) data preparation and representation, (2) differentially private fine-tuning of LLMs, (3) fairness-constrained generation, and (4) evaluation framework.

### 2.1 Data Preparation and Representation

To effectively utilize LLMs for tabular data generation, we need a structured approach to represent tabular data as text:

1. **Tabular Data Serialization**: Each tabular row will be serialized into a text sequence using a consistent format:
   ```
   <COL1>: value1 <COL2>: value2 ... <COLn>: valueN
   ```
   
2. **Data Type Handling**: We will implement specific handling for different data types:
   - Numerical features will be normalized and represented with consistent precision
   - Categorical features will be represented as their original labels
   - Date/time features will be converted to a standardized format

3. **Schema Description**: A schema description will be provided to the LLM as a prefix to each generation task:
   ```
   <SCHEMA>
   Column1: type=numeric, min=X, max=Y
   Column2: type=categorical, categories=[A, B, C]
   ...
   </SCHEMA>
   ```

### 2.2 Differentially Private Fine-tuning

To ensure privacy protection, we will incorporate differential privacy into the LLM fine-tuning process:

1. **DP-SGD Implementation**: We will implement Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) for fine-tuning the LLM:

   $$\tilde{g}_t(x_i) = \text{clip}(\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta_t, x_i), C) + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 C^2 \mathbf{I})$$

   where:
   - $\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta_t, x_i)$ is the gradient of the loss function at datapoint $x_i$
   - $\text{clip}(g, C) = g \cdot \min(1, \frac{C}{||g||_2})$ clips the gradient to have a maximum L2 norm of $C$
   - $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 C^2 \mathbf{I})$ is Gaussian noise with standard deviation $\sigma C$

2. **Privacy Accounting**: We will use the Rényi Differential Privacy (RDP) accountant to track privacy budget expenditure during training:

   $$\varepsilon = \min_{\alpha > 1} \frac{\alpha - 1}{\alpha} \cdot RDP(\alpha) + \frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha}$$

   where $RDP(\alpha)$ represents the RDP guarantee at order $\alpha$.

3. **Two-Stage Fine-tuning Approach**:
   - Stage 1: Non-private pre-training on publicly available similar datasets or synthetic data from standard generative models
   - Stage 2: Differentially private fine-tuning on the sensitive private dataset

### 2.3 Fairness-Constrained Generation

To ensure fairness in the generated data, we will incorporate fairness constraints during both training and generation:

1. **Fairness Metrics**: We will focus on two primary fairness metrics:
   
   - **Demographic Parity (DP)**: The probability of a positive outcome should be equal across all protected groups:
     $$DP = |P(\hat{Y}=1|A=0) - P(\hat{Y}=1|A=1)|$$
   
   - **Equalized Odds (EO)**: The true positive and false positive rates should be equal across all protected groups:
     $$EO = |P(\hat{Y}=1|Y=y,A=0) - P(\hat{Y}=1|Y=y,A=1)|$$

   where $A$ represents the protected attribute and $Y$ is the target variable.

2. **Fairness-Aware Loss Function**: We will incorporate fairness constraints directly into the training objective:

   $$\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{LM} + \lambda_1 \cdot \mathcal{L}_{DP} + \lambda_2 \cdot \mathcal{L}_{EO}$$

   where $\mathcal{L}_{LM}$ is the standard language modeling loss, and $\mathcal{L}_{DP}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{EO}$ are fairness regularization terms.

3. **Constrained Decoding**: During generation, we will implement a constraint-guided decoding algorithm:
   - Monitor fairness metrics on-the-fly as rows are generated
   - Adjust sampling probabilities to favor generations that improve fairness metrics
   - Implement rejection sampling for outputs that violate fairness constraints beyond a threshold

### 2.4 Implementation Details

1. **Base Models**: We will experiment with different sizes of pre-trained LLMs:
   - Smaller models: GPT-2, BART, T5
   - Larger models: LLaMA-2, Mistral-7B (with parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches like LoRA)

2. **Training Algorithm**:
   
   ```

   1. Convert tabular dataset D to text format
   2. Initialize model with pre-trained LLM weights
   3. Define combined loss function L_total
   4. For each epoch:
       a. Sample minibatch B from D
       b. Compute gradients for each example
       c. Clip individual gradients to norm C
       d. Add Gaussian noise to clipped gradients
       e. Update model parameters with noisy gradients
       f. Update privacy budget using RDP accountant
       g. If privacy budget exceeded, stop training
   5. Return fine-tuned model
   ```

3. **Generation Algorithm**:

   ```
   Algorithm: Fairness-Constrained Generation
   Input: Fine-tuned model M, schema description S, number of rows N, fairness constraints
   Output: Synthetic dataset D_syn with N rows
   
   1. Initialize D_syn as empty
   2. Initialize fairness metrics tracking
   3. For i = 1 to N:
       a. Generate row r_i using model M conditioned on schema S
       b. If r_i violates data type or range constraints, reject and regenerate
       c. Update running fairness metrics with r_i
       d. If fairness constraints are violated beyond threshold:
          i. Reject r_i and regenerate with adjusted sampling
       e. Add valid r_i to D_syn
   4. Return D_syn
   ```

2. **Privacy Guarantees**: Ensuring that privacy claims are mathematically sound and practically meaningful
   
3. **Fairness Definitions**: Acknowledging that different fairness definitions may be appropriate in different contexts, and that no single definition addresses all concerns

We commit to responsible research practices, including thorough ablation studies, sensitivity analyses, and comprehensive reporting of both positive and negative results.
