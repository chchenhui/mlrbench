# Mitigating Fairness Bias in Tabular Data through Conditional Diffusion Models

## Motivation
Tabular data often suffers from under-representation and bias issues, particularly affecting minorities and disadvantaged groups in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and education. Traditional ML models trained on biased datasets perpetuate and amplify these biases. While generative models can augment datasets, they frequently reproduce the same biases present in the training data. There's an urgent need for synthetic data generation techniques that can specifically address fairness concerns in tabular data while maintaining utility for downstream ML tasks.

## Main Idea
I propose a conditional diffusion model architecture specifically designed for tabular data that incorporates fairness constraints during the generative process. The approach uses a two-stage process: first, identifying under-represented groups and fairness metrics via causal discovery techniques; second, conditionally generating synthetic samples with controlled attribute ratios to balance the dataset. The model incorporates differential privacy mechanisms to ensure individual privacy while generating fair synthetic samples. The architecture includes adaptive noise scheduling that varies based on sensitive attributes, enabling more nuanced generation for minority groups. The expected outcome is a framework that produces synthetic tabular datasets with demonstrably improved fairness metrics while maintaining statistical similarity to the original data, enabling more equitable ML model training across domains where tabular data is predominant.
