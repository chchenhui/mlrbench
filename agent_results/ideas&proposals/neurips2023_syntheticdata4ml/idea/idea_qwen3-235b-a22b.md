# Title: "FairFlow: Incorporating Differential Privacy and Fairness Constraints in Normalizing Flow-Based Synthetic Data Generation"

# Motivation:
High-quality synthetic data generation remains crucial for trustworthy ML, yet existing methods often prioritize data fidelity over formal privacy guarantees and fairness mitigation. Current synthetic data approaches struggle to address data scarcity, privacy risks, and representation bias simultaneously, limiting their applicability in high-stakes domains where ethical and legal considerations are paramount.

# Main Idea:
We propose FairFlow, a framework integrating differential privacy (DP) and fairness-aware objectives into normalizing flow architectures for synthetic tabular data generation. Our method applies DP during flow training through gradient norm clipping and calibrated noise addition while incorporating fairness regularization via adversarial components that minimize demographic parity differences and equal opportunity disparities. By leveraging the invertible nature of flows for precise data representation, FairFlow maintains statistical utility while mitigating both individual and systemic biases. Evaluation involves benchmarking against medical and financial datasets through (1) data quality metrics (e.g., MLP classification accuracy on synthetic data), (2) formal DP guarantees via RÃ©nyi divergence analysis, and (3) fairness quantification across intersectional demographics. The work provides a blueprint for developing synthetic data generators that concurrently address legal compliance (via formal privacy) and ethical requirements (via fairness metrics) for real-world deployment.
