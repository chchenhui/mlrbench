### Title: Generating Fair and Private Synthetic Data with Generative AI

### Motivation:
The workshop aims to address the critical challenges of data scarcity, privacy, and bias in machine learning. While generative AI offers promising solutions, current research often overlooks privacy and fairness aspects. Focusing on these aspects can significantly enhance the trustworthiness and applicability of machine learning models in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and education.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research idea is to develop a hybrid generative model that combines the strengths of large language models and conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to generate high-quality synthetic data that is both fair and private. The methodology involves:

1. **Pre-training on Large Language Models**: Utilize pre-trained language models to capture the underlying data distributions and generate initial synthetic data.
2. **Conditional GANs for Fine-tuning**: Employ cGANs to condition the synthetic data generation process on specific attributes to ensure fairness and representation. This step will address bias and under-representation issues.
3. **Privacy-Enhancing Techniques**: Integrate differential privacy mechanisms into the generative process to ensure that the synthetic data cannot be easily traced back to the original data, thus preserving privacy.

Expected outcomes include:

- **High-Quality Synthetic Data**: Generation of synthetic datasets that closely match the statistical properties of the real data.
- **Fairness**: Mitigation of bias and under-representation by conditioning the generative process on diverse attributes.
- **Privacy**: Implementation of privacy-preserving techniques that prevent re-identification of individuals from the synthetic data.

Potential impact:

- **Empowering Trustworthy ML**: Enhancing the reliability and fairness of machine learning models by providing high-quality, privacy-preserving synthetic data.
- **Broader Adoption**: Facilitating the adoption of machine learning in sensitive domains by addressing privacy and fairness concerns.
- **Cross-Domain Applications**: Extending the applicability of the proposed methodology to various data modalities, including tabular and time series data.
