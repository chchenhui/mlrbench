**Title:** Differentially Private and Fair Tabular Data Synthesis via Constrained Large Language Models

**Motivation:** Generating synthetic tabular data is crucial for overcoming scarcity, privacy, and bias issues in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for high-fidelity generation, but naively applying them can leak private information or perpetuate societal biases present in the original data. We need methods that explicitly control for privacy and fairness during generation.

**Main Idea:** We propose fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs specifically for generating differentially private (DP) and fair synthetic tabular data. The core idea involves incorporating DP mechanisms (e.g., DP-SGD during fine-tuning, noise injection during generation) and fairness constraints directly into the LLM's training objective or decoding process. Fairness constraints could target group fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds) for specified sensitive attributes. The LLM learns to generate realistic tabular rows while adhering to these constraints. Expected outcomes include high-utility synthetic data with quantifiable DP guarantees and improved fairness metrics compared to baseline generation methods, enabling more trustworthy ML model development.
