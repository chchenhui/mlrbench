Title: FairDP-Diffusion: Privacy-Preserving and Fair Tabular Data Synthesis via Diffusion Models

Motivation:  
High-fidelity synthetic tabular data generators often ignore bias and privacy simultaneously. Existing tools either compromise utility when enforcing differential privacy (DP) or fail to correct under-representation of vulnerable groups. A unified framework is needed to produce large-scale synthetic tables that respect privacy guarantees and deliver fairness across sensitive attributes.

Main Idea:  
We propose FairDP-Diffusion, a conditional diffusion model for tabular data synthesis that jointly enforces Îµ-DP and fairness constraints. At each reverse diffusion step, we inject calibrated Gaussian noise to satisfy DP, and apply a Lagrangian penalty targeting statistical parity (or equalized odds) on user-specified sensitive features. The model is trained end-to-end: the noise schedule ensures privacy, while fairness gradients steer sample generation toward balanced class proportions. We will evaluate on healthcare and credit-scoring datasets, measuring utility (statistical fidelity), privacy leakage (membership inference risk), and fairness metrics. FairDP-Diffusion aims to empower practitioners with trustworthy, bias-aware synthetic data at arbitrary scales for robust ML training.
