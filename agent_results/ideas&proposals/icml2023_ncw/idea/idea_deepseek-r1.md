**Title:** Bridging Rate-Distortion Theory and Neural Compression: A Framework for Provably Efficient Generative Codecs  

**Motivation:** Modern neural compression methods (e.g., diffusion models, autoencoders) outperform classical codecs empirically but lack rigorous theoretical guarantees on their optimality or convergence. Bridging information-theoretic principles like rate-distortion theory with deep generative models is critical to ensure reliable, efficient compression for safety-critical applications (e.g., medical imaging) and to unify empirical advances with mathematical foundations.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a framework integrating rate-distortion theory with neural compression by training deep generative codecs under variational bounds on rate and distortion. The encoder maps inputs to latent distributions optimized for minimal rate (via entropy regularization) and distortion (via reconstruction loss), while the decoder leverages diffusion models to sample high-fidelity reconstructions. Crucially, we derive distortion-adaptive bounds on the rate term using channel coding theorems, and analyze trade-offs between computational efficiency and information-theoretic limits. Experiments will benchmark against traditional codecs and neural baselines, with formal guarantees on convergence. This approach aims to yield neural compressors that are both state-of-the-art and theoretically grounded, enabling deployment in domains requiring certifiable performance.
