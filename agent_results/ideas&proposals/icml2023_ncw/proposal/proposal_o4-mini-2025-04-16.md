1. Title  
FlowCodec: Continuous-Flow Neural Compression with Information-Bottleneck Guarantees

2. Introduction  
Background  
The burgeoning volume of multimedia data (images, video, audio) in modern applications demands ever more efficient and adaptive compression schemes. Traditional codecs rely on hand-tuned transforms and discrete quantization, while recent learning-based compressors often adopt vector-quantized latent representations (e.g., VQ-VAEs, VCT). Although these methods have achieved impressive rate-distortion performance, the inherent discreteness of quantization breaks end-to-end differentiability, complicates theoretical analysis, and can introduce artifacts that degrade perceptual quality. Meanwhile, normalizing flows have emerged as powerful, fully differentiable generative models, capable of tractable density evaluation and invertible mappings under continuous transformations.

Research Objectives  
We propose FlowCodec, a novel neural compressor built on continuous normalizing flows, that replaces discrete quantization with small Gaussian dequantization noise and imposes an explicit Information Bottleneck (IB) penalty to tightly control the rate–distortion (RD) trade-off. The primary objectives are:  
• Design a fully differentiable encoder–decoder leveraging normalizing flows for lossless mapping and tractable latent densities.  
• Integrate an IB regularizer $\beta\,\mathrm{KL}\bigl(q(z|x)\,\|\,p(z)\bigr)$ to enforce an explicit rate penalty and yield a smooth RD curve.  
• Derive theoretical upper bounds on achievable rates via variational $f$-divergence approximations, linking the IB coefficient $\beta$ to fundamental RD limits.  
• Validate that FlowCodec matches or exceeds vector-quantized baselines in PSNR, MS-SSIM, LPIPS, and latency across standard image and video datasets, and extends naturally to joint source–channel coding.

Significance  
By marrying normalizing flows with information-theoretic principles, FlowCodec bridges a critical gap between practical compression performance and theoretical guarantees. Its end-to-end differentiability simplifies optimization and enables more precise control over rate allocation. The proposed framework advances the state of the art in neural compression, informs fundamental limits in learned representations, and lays a foundation for robust, theory-grounded codecs applicable to distributed and noisy channels.

3. Methodology  
3.1 Overview  
FlowCodec consists of three components: (i) a continuous flow encoder $E_\theta: x\to z$ with tractable density $q_\theta(z|x)$; (ii) a flexible flow prior $p_\phi(z)$; and (iii) a decoder $D_\psi: z\to \hat x$ that inverts reversible transforms. Instead of hard quantization, we inject small dequantization noise into $z$ and penalize the divergence between $q_\theta(z|x)$ and $p_\phi(z)$ to approximate the coding cost.

3.2 Continuous Encoder–Decoder Architecture  
• Base transform: We adopt a multi-scale coupling architecture (inspired by RealNVP/Glow), stacking $L$ flow layers. Each layer $l$ applies an invertible mapping  
$$z^{(l)} = f_\theta^{(l)}\bigl(z^{(l-1)}\bigr),\quad z^{(0)}=x$$  
with Jacobian determinant $\det \bigl|\partial f_\theta^{(l)} / \partial z^{(l-1)}\bigr|$ computed in closed form.  
• Split and squeeze: At each scale we squeeze spatial dimensions and split off a subset of channels to form latent components, increasing computational efficiency.  
• Flow prior: We model $p_\phi(z)$ as another normalizing flow with $M$ layers, trained jointly to fit the aggregated posterior  
$$\hat p_\phi(z) \approx \int q_\theta(z|x)\,p(x)\,dx.$$  

3.3 Dequantization and Rate Penalty  
Discrete quantization is replaced by continuous dequantization: for each sample $x$, we sample  
$$\tilde z = z + \varepsilon,\quad \varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 I),$$  
yielding a smoothed encoder density  
$$q_\theta(\tilde z|x) = \int q_\theta(z|x)\,\mathcal{N}(\tilde z - z;\,0,\sigma^2I)\,dz.$$  
We then impose an IB penalty  
$$R(x) = \mathrm{KL}\bigl(q_\theta(\tilde z|x)\,\|\,p_\phi(\tilde z)\bigr).$$  

3.4 Loss Function and Rate–Distortion Lagrangian  
Training minimizes the expected Lagrangian  
$$\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi,\psi) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{\mathrm{data}}}\Bigl[\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{\tilde z\sim q_\theta(\cdot|x)}\bigl[d\bigl(x,D_\psi(\tilde z)\bigr)\bigr]}_{\text{Distortion}} + \beta\,\underbrace{\mathrm{KL}\bigl(q_\theta(\tilde z|x)\,\|\,p_\phi(\tilde z)\bigr)}_{\text{Rate penalty}}\Bigr],$$  
where $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ may be mean squared error (MSE), perceptual distance, or a combination thereof. The hyperparameter $\beta$ controls the RD trade-off.

3.5 Theoretical Rate–Distortion Bounds  
Using variational $f$-divergence techniques, we derive an upper bound on the achievable rate $R$ for any distortion $D$. Let $D_0$ be the minimum achievable distortion under unlimited rate; then for any $\beta>0$, FlowCodec achieves a point on the convex RD hull satisfying  
$$D(\beta) \le D_0 + \beta \, \inf_{q,p}\bigl\{\mathrm{KL}(q\|p)\bigr\},$$  
and can approximate the true RD function within an error of $O(\sigma\sqrt{\log(1/\sigma)})$. Full proofs leverage the continuous dequantization noise to bound the discretization gap.

3.6 Algorithmic Steps  
1. Initialize parameters $\theta,\phi,\psi$ of encoder flows, prior flows, and decoder.  
2. For each mini-batch $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$ from $p_{\mathrm{data}}$:  
   a. Compute latent means and Jacobians via $z_i=f_\theta(x_i)$.  
   b. Sample dequant noise $\varepsilon_i\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2I)$ to obtain $\tilde z_i=z_i+\varepsilon_i$.  
   c. Evaluate prior density $p_\phi(\tilde z_i)$ via inverse flows.  
   d. Decode $\hat x_i=D_\psi(\tilde z_i)$ and compute distortion $d_i$.  
   e. Compute rate penalty $r_i = \log q_\theta(\tilde z_i|x_i) - \log p_\phi(\tilde z_i)$.  
   f. Form Lagrangian loss $\ell_i = d_i + \beta\,r_i$ and backpropagate to update $\theta,\phi,\psi$.  
3. Anneal $\beta$ (optional) to sweep the RD curve, or train multiple models for different target bitrates.
