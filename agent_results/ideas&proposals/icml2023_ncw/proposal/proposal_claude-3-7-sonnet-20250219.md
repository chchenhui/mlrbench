# FlowCodec: Continuous-Flow Neural Compression with Information-Bottleneck Guarantees

## 1. Introduction

The explosion of digital content has made data compression more critical than ever. Traditional codecs like JPEG, H.265, and MP3 have served us well, but they rely on hand-designed transforms and quantization schemes that fail to adapt to the statistical properties of modern multimedia content. Recent advances in machine learning have sparked a revolution in compression, with neural networks achieving unprecedented rate-distortion performance across various data modalities.

However, most neural compression methods still rely on discrete quantization, which introduces several fundamental limitations. First, quantization disrupts end-to-end differentiability during training, necessitating approximations like straight-through estimators or soft relaxations, which complicate optimization and introduce training-inference mismatches. Second, discrete quantization creates a theoretical disconnect, making it difficult to derive precise information-theoretic guarantees on compression performance. Third, the imposed discretization often leads to suboptimal rate-distortion trade-offs, particularly for complex, high-dimensional data where fine-grained continuous representations might better preserve critical details.

This research proposes FlowCodec, a novel neural compression framework that replaces traditional quantization with continuous normalizing flows. By leveraging the bijective properties of normalizing flows and incorporating an explicit information bottleneck constraint, FlowCodec offers several key advantages:

1. **Full differentiability**: The continuous nature of the latent space allows for seamless gradient propagation during training, simplifying optimization and ensuring consistency between training and inference.

2. **Theoretical guarantees**: The framework enables precise information-theoretic analysis through variational bounds on mutual information, establishing direct connections to rate-distortion theory.

3. **Flexible rate control**: The information bottleneck parameter β provides a natural mechanism for controlling the compression rate, allowing for precise targeting of specific bit rates without retraining.

4. **Enhanced detail preservation**: The continuous representation allows for more nuanced encoding of high-frequency details and textures that are often lost with discrete quantization.

The significance of this research extends beyond compression metrics. FlowCodec establishes a theoretically grounded bridge between information theory, continuous normalizing flows, and compression, opening new avenues for analyzing and understanding neural compression systems. Furthermore, the framework's inherent flexibility enables natural extensions to joint source-channel coding, conditional compression, and adaptive rate allocation—capabilities that are increasingly important for real-world deployment across varying network conditions and device capabilities.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Overall Architecture

FlowCodec consists of three primary components: (1) an encoder network $E$ that transforms the input $x$ into a continuous latent representation $z$, (2) a decoder network $D$ that reconstructs the input from the latent representation, and (3) a normalizing flow prior $p(z)$ that models the distribution of the latent space. The architecture is illustrated in Figure 1 (not shown).

The encoder maps the input $x$ to parameters of a distribution $q(z|x)$, specifically:

$$E(x) = (\mu_x, \sigma_x)$$

Where $\mu_x$ is the mean vector and $\sigma_x$ is the scale vector of a factorized Gaussian distribution:

$$q(z|x) = \mathcal{N}(z; \mu_x, \text{diag}(\sigma_x^2))$$

This distribution defines the encoding distribution in the latent space. Instead of discretizing this representation as in traditional neural codecs, we maintain its continuous nature.

### 2.2 Normalizing Flow Prior

A key innovation in FlowCodec is the use of a normalizing flow to model the prior distribution $p(z)$. Normalizing flows are bijective mappings that transform a simple base distribution (e.g., standard Gaussian) into a more complex distribution. For our prior, we define:

$$p(z) = p_u(f^{-1}(z))\left|\det\left(\frac{\partial f^{-1}(z)}{\partial z}\right)\right|$$

Where $f$ is the flow function, $p_u$ is a simple base distribution (typically $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$), and the determinant term accounts for the change of variables. We implement $f$ using a sequence of coupling layers, each with the form:

$$y_{1:d} = x_{1:d}$$
$$y_{d+1:D} = x_{d+1:D} \odot \exp(s(x_{1:d})) + t(x_{1:d})$$

Where $s$ and $t$ are scale and translation networks, and $D$ is the dimensionality of the latent space. This construction ensures invertibility while allowing complex transformations of the latent distribution.

### 2.3 Training Objective with Information Bottleneck

The training objective combines reconstruction quality with an information bottleneck constraint:

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{\text{data}}}\left[ \text{Dist}(x, \hat{x}) + \beta \cdot \text{KL}(q(z|x) \| p(z)) \right]$$

Where:
- $\text{Dist}(x, \hat{x})$ is a distortion measure between the input $x$ and reconstruction $\hat{x} = D(z)$, with $z \sim q(z|x)$
- $\text{KL}(q(z|x) \| p(z))$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the encoding distribution and the prior
- $\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier controlling the rate-distortion trade-off

This objective has a direct information-theoretic interpretation: the KL divergence term bounds the bitrate required to encode the latent representation, while the distortion term measures reconstruction quality. The parameter $\beta$ allows for precise control over the rate-distortion trade-off.

### 2.4 Dequantization Noise

To bridge the gap between continuous representations during training and the need for precise bit-rate control during deployment, we introduce a controlled amount of dequantization noise. During training, we add small Gaussian noise to the latent representation:

$$z_{\text{noisy}} = z + \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\text{dequant}}^2 I)$$

This serves two purposes: (1) it regularizes the model, encouraging robustness to small perturbations in the latent space, and (2) it simulates the effect of finite-precision arithmetic that will be used during deployment. The dequantization noise level $\sigma_{\text{dequant}}$ is annealed during training, starting from a larger value and gradually decreasing to match the target precision.

### 2.5 Encoding and Decoding Process

During encoding, we compute the mean and scale parameters using the encoder:

$$(\mu_x, \sigma_x) = E(x)$$

We then sample from the resulting distribution:

$$z \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_x, \text{diag}(\sigma_x^2))$$

For practical deployment, we use a deterministic encoding by setting $z = \mu_x$, which minimizes expected distortion.

The actual bitstream is generated by arithmetic coding using the probability model defined by the normalizing flow prior $p(z)$. The prior provides the probability density for each component of $z$, which is converted to a cumulative distribution function (CDF) for arithmetic coding.

During decoding, the received bitstream is decoded using arithmetic decoding with the same prior model to recover $z$, and then the decoder network generates the reconstruction:

$$\hat{x} = D(z)$$

### 2.6 Theoretical Analysis

A key advantage of our continuous flow-based approach is the ability to derive theoretical guarantees. We can establish an upper bound on the achievable rate using the variational representation of mutual information:

$$I(X; Z) \leq \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{\text{data}}, z \sim q(z|x)}[\log q(z|x) - \log p(z)]$$

This bound becomes tight when the prior $p(z)$ matches the marginal distribution $\int q(z|x)p_{\text{data}}(x)dx$. Our normalizing flow prior is specifically designed to approximate this marginal, leading to near-optimal compression performance.

Furthermore, we can derive a connection between the Lagrange multiplier $\beta$ and the slope of the rate-distortion curve:

$$\beta = -\frac{dD}{dR}$$

This provides a principled way to select $\beta$ based on target rate-distortion requirements.

### 2.7 Implementation Details and Experimental Design

We implement FlowCodec using the following architecture specifications:

1. **Encoder network**: A convolutional neural network with residual connections. For image compression, we use a structure similar to CompressAI's Mean-Scale Hyperprior model, but outputting means and scales for a Gaussian distribution rather than discrete latents.

2. **Decoder network**: A mirror of the encoder with transposed convolutions for upsampling.

3. **Flow prior**: A sequence of 8 coupling layers, each using 3-layer MLPs for the scale and translation networks. We explore both affine and rational quadratic spline coupling layers.

4. **Distortion metrics**: We implement multiple distortion metrics, including MSE, MS-SSIM, and LPIPS, allowing for optimization based on different perceptual criteria.

We evaluate FlowCodec on the following datasets:

1. **Image compression**: Kodak, CLIC2020, and DIV2K datasets
2. **Video compression**: UVG and HEVC Class B test sequences
3. **Audio compression**: VCTK speech corpus and the MTG-Jamendo music dataset

For each modality, we compare against:
- Traditional codecs (JPEG, H.265, Opus)
- Discrete neural codecs (CompressAI models, Google's HiFiC, etc.)
- Other continuous approaches (Helminger et al.'s flow-based compression)

We evaluate performance using both objective metrics (PSNR, MS-SSIM, LPIPS for images; VMAF for video; PESQ, STOI for audio) and subjective assessments through user studies that evaluate perceived quality.

To validate the theoretical guarantees, we also measure:
1. The gap between the theoretical rate bound and actual coding rate
2. The relationship between $\beta$ and the operational rate-distortion curve
3. The impact of the flow prior complexity on compression performance

2. **Theoretical insights**: The continuous nature of our approach will provide new theoretical insights into the relationship between the information bottleneck principle and rate-distortion optimization. These insights can guide future research in neural compression and help bridge the gap between practice and theory.

3. **Enhanced flexibility**: The continuous representation enables more flexible adaptation to different content types and quality requirements without retraining, simply by adjusting the β parameter. This adaptability is particularly valuable for variable-bandwidth scenarios or content-adaptive compression.

4. **Improved training stability**: By eliminating the non-differentiable quantization step, FlowCodec will exhibit more stable training dynamics and faster convergence. This stability should result in more consistent performance across different initialization conditions and hyperparameter settings.
