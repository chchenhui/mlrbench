### Title: Dynamic Component Adaptation for Continual Compositional Learning

### Introduction

#### Background
Compositional learning, inspired by human reasoning, aims to enable machines to understand and generate complex ideas from simpler concepts. This approach has shown promise in various domains such as machine translation, cross-lingual transfer, and reinforcement learning. However, current methods often assume static primitives, limiting their applicability in dynamic, real-world environments where data distributions and component semantics evolve over time. This research seeks to address this gap by developing a framework for dynamic component adaptation in continual compositional learning.

#### Research Objectives
The primary objective of this research is to develop a framework that allows compositional learning models to dynamically adapt their primitive components and composition mechanisms in response to evolving data streams. This involves:
1. Detecting concept drift within compositional representations.
2. Incrementally updating or adding components without catastrophic forgetting.
3. Adapting composition mechanisms to combine components based on new evidence.

#### Significance
This research aims to enhance the robustness and adaptability of compositional learning models, enabling them to generalize effectively in non-stationary environments. By addressing the challenges of dynamic component adaptation, concept drift detection, incremental component learning, and adaptive composition mechanisms, this work contributes to the broader field of continual learning and compositional generalization.

### Methodology

#### Research Design
The proposed framework consists of three main components: concept drift detection, incremental component learning, and adaptive composition mechanisms. The overall research design is as follows:

1. **Concept Drift Detection**:
   - **Method**: Implement a concept drift detection method based on maximum concept discrepancy (MCD-DD) [Wan et al., 2024] to identify shifts in component semantics or relationships within compositional representations.
   - **Algorithm**:
     1. Train a contrastive learning model to embed compositional units.
     2. Calculate the maximum concept discrepancy between current and past embeddings.
     3. Set a threshold to detect significant shifts indicating concept drift.

2. **Incremental Component Learning**:
   - **Method**: Utilize generative replay or parameter isolation techniques to update or add components incrementally.
   - **Algorithm**:
     1. **Generative Replay**: Generate synthetic samples from past data distributions to maintain previously learned knowledge.
     2. **Parameter Isolation**: Freeze the parameters of existing components and train new components using new data.

3. **Adaptive Composition Mechanisms**:
   - **Method**: Design flexible composition mechanisms such as attention or routing to adjust how components are combined based on new evidence.
   - **Algorithm**:
     1. **Attention Mechanism**: Use attention weights to dynamically select and combine components based on their relevance to the current task.
     2. **Routing Mechanism**: Implement a routing network to decide the flow of information between components.

#### Evaluation Metrics
To validate the proposed framework, the following evaluation metrics will be used:
1. **Concept Drift Detection Accuracy**: Measure the accuracy of detecting concept drift using precision, recall, and F1-score.
2. **Component Update Accuracy**: Evaluate the performance of updated components in terms of classification accuracy.
3. **Compositional Generalization**: Assess the modelâ€™s ability to generalize to new tasks or data distributions using cross-validation and out-of-distribution evaluation.

### Expected Outcomes & Impact

#### Outcomes
1. **Dynamic Component Adaptation Framework**: Develop a comprehensive framework for dynamic component adaptation in continual compositional learning.
2. **Concept Drift Detection Method**: Implement a robust concept drift detection method based on maximum concept discrepancy.
3. **Incremental Component Learning Techniques**: Propose and evaluate techniques for updating or adding components without catastrophic forgetting.
4. **Adaptive Composition Mechanisms**: Design and implement flexible composition mechanisms for robust reasoning in non-stationary environments.

#### Impact
This research is expected to have a significant impact on the field of continual learning and compositional generalization. By addressing the challenges of dynamic component adaptation, concept drift detection, incremental component learning, and adaptive composition mechanisms, the proposed framework will enhance the robustness and adaptability of compositional learning models. This will enable these models to generalize effectively in real-world environments where data distributions and component semantics evolve over time, leading to improved performance in various applications such as machine translation, cross-lingual transfer, and reinforcement learning.
