## 1. Title

**Dynamic Component Adaptation for Continual Compositional Learning in Evolving Environments**

## 2. Introduction

### Background

Compositional learning represents a cornerstone principle in building intelligent systems that mirror human cognitive abilities. By learning to understand and generate complex concepts through the combination of simpler, reusable primitives, machines can achieve remarkable generalization capabilities, particularly towards out-of-distribution (OOD) data encountered in real-world scenarios (Lake et al., 2017; Andreas, 2019). This principle has fueled significant research across diverse fields, including object-centric learning (Locatello et al., 2020), compositional generalization in NLP (Keysers et al., 2020), and visual reasoning (Johnson et al., 2017), demonstrating its potential in tasks ranging from machine translation to controllable generation and reinforcement learning. The core promise lies in leveraging learned components (e.g., object representations, semantic concepts, motor skills) and their composition rules to construct novel, unseen combinations, thereby enhancing robustness and sample efficiency.

However, the real world is rarely static. Data distributions shift, concepts evolve, new objects or relationships appear, and task requirements change over time. This dynamic nature poses a fundamental challenge known as continual learning (CL) (Parisi et al., 2019; De Lange et al., 2021). Standard machine learning models, including many compositional learning approaches, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting â€“ the tendency to drastically lose performance on previously learned tasks or data when trained on new information. Existing compositional learning frameworks typically assume that the primitive components and the rules governing their combination remain fixed after an initial learning phase. This assumption breaks down in continual learning settings, where components might change semantically (e.g., the appearance of "car" evolves), new components emerge (e.g., a new object class appears), or the way components interact changes (e.g., new physics rules apply in a simulation). Consequently, models relying on static compositional structures become obsolete or fail catastrophically when faced with such non-stationarity.

This research proposal directly addresses the critical intersection of compositional learning and continual learning, tackling a key challenge highlighted in the workshop call: "What unique challenges arise when extending compositional learning strategies to continual learning environments, and what are the possible solutions?". Current research often focuses on either compositionality with static components or continual learning on non-compositional tasks. There is a pressing need for methods that allow compositional systems to *continually adapt* their fundamental building blocks and composition mechanisms in response to evolving data streams, thereby maintaining performance and relevance over extended periods.

### Research Idea

We propose a novel framework, **Dynamic Component Adaptation for Continual Compositional Learning (DCA-CCL)**, designed to equip compositional models with the ability to gracefully adapt to non-stationary environments. The core idea is to move beyond static primitives and composition rules by integrating three key capabilities:

1.  **Composition-Aware Concept Drift Detection:** Develop methods to monitor the learned compositional representations (both individual components and their interactions) and detect significant shifts or drifts occurring over time in the input data stream. This goes beyond standard drift detection by focusing on changes relevant to the compositional structure.
2.  **Incremental Component Learning:** Upon detecting drift, employ techniques that allow for the modification of existing components or the seamless integration of new components without disrupting previously acquired knowledge. This involves leveraging CL strategies like generative replay or parameter regularization tailored for modular/compositional architectures.
3.  **Adaptive Composition Mechanisms:** Enable the model's composition function (e.g., attention mechanisms, graph neural network aggregators, symbolic rule applications) to adapt dynamically, reflecting changes in how components should be combined based on the most recent data or detected drifts.

By combining these elements, the DCA-CCL framework aims to achieve robust compositional generalization *and* reasoning capabilities that persist over time, even as the underlying data distribution evolves.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **To develop and evaluate concept drift detection methods specifically tailored for compositional representations.** These methods should identify shifts in individual component semantics, the emergence of new components, and changes in the relationships or rules governing component interactions. We will investigate adapting recent representation-based drift detectors (Wan et al., 2024; Greco et al., 2024) to operate on component embeddings or intermediate compositional structures.
2.  **To design and implement incremental learning algorithms for updating and expanding the set of primitive components within a compositional model.** This involves adapting and comparing strategies like generative replay, knowledge distillation, and parameter isolation/regularization (e.g., EWC, SI) within the context of modular or object-centric architectures, ensuring minimal catastrophic forgetting of prior compositional knowledge.
3.  **To create adaptive composition mechanisms that can dynamically adjust how components are combined.** This could involve making mechanisms like attention weights, routing functions, or graph connectivity context-dependent or updating them incrementally based on drift signals.
4.  **To integrate these components into a unified DCA-CCL framework.** This framework will orchestrate drift detection, component adaptation, and composition mechanism updates in a cohesive manner.
5.  **To empirically validate the DCA-CCL framework on carefully designed benchmarks.** These benchmarks will simulate continual learning scenarios with compositional drift, comparing the proposed approach against relevant baselines in terms of sustained task performance, adaptation capability, and mitigation of forgetting.

### Significance

This research holds significant potential for advancing both the fields of compositional learning and continual learning.

1.  **Bridging Compositional and Continual Learning:** It addresses a critical gap by developing principled methods for making compositional systems adaptive over time, moving towards AI capable of lifelong learning in dynamic environments.
2.  **Enhancing AI Robustness:** Dynamically adapting components and composition rules can lead to significantly more robust AI systems that maintain performance despite distribution shifts, concept evolution, and changing task demands, crucial for real-world deployment in areas like robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive agents.
3.  **Informing Foundation Model Development:** Understanding how to build adaptability into compositional structures can provide insights into designing more flexible and continually relevant large-scale models, potentially mitigating issues of obsolescence and improving their ability to handle novel combinations arising from evolving data.
4.  **Addressing Workshop Themes:** This work directly contributes to the workshop's foci on "Methods" (designing transferable and adaptable compositional methods) and "Paths Forward" (tackling challenges of compositional learning in continual settings), offering concrete solutions and a framework for future investigation.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Overall Framework

The proposed DCA-CCL framework operates on a continuous stream of data. It integrates a base compositional learning model (e.g., an object-centric VAE, a modular neural network) with adaptation modules. The overall workflow is envisioned as follows:

1.  **Input Stream Processing:** The model receives batches of data $(X_t, Y_t)$ sequentially over time $t$.
2.  **Compositional Representation:** The base model processes $X_t$ to produce compositional representations, potentially including component embeddings $\{\mathbf{z}_{i,t}\}$ and intermediate compositional structures.
3.  **Drift Detection:** A dedicated module analyzes the sequence of representations $\{\mathbf{z}_{i,t}\}$ or related statistics (e.g., reconstruction errors, distribution of composed outputs) to detect concept drift. We will adapt methods like MCD-DD (Wan et al., 2024) or DriftLens (Greco et al., 2024).
4.  **Component Adaptation Trigger:** If significant drift is detected, the adaptation mechanism is triggered. The drift detector may also provide information about *which* components or relationships are affected.
5.  **Incremental Component Learning:** Affected components $\mathbf{z}_i$ (represented by parameters $\phi_i$ in the encoder/decoder or module) are updated, or new components are added. Techniques like generative replay (using a learned generator $G$ to produce pseudo-samples of past components) or parameter regularization (e.g., EWC) will be employed to prevent forgetting.
6.  **Adaptive Composition Mechanism:** The parameters $\theta$ governing the composition function $f(\{\mathbf{z}_i\}; \theta)$ are updated to reflect new data or detected changes in component interactions. This might involve direct updates or adapting routing/attention weights.
7.  **Task Prediction/Generation:** The adapted model uses the updated components and composition mechanism to perform the downstream task (e.g., classification, generation) on new data $X_{t+1}$.

### 3.2 Data Collection and Generation

Evaluating DCA-CCL requires datasets exhibiting non-stationarity specifically within their compositional structure. We plan to use a combination of synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks:

1.  **Continual Compositional MNIST (C-MNIST-Seq):** Modify existing compositional variants of MNIST (e.g., where digits are combined) to introduce sequential changes. Drifts could include:
    *   *Component Appearance Drift:* Gradually changing the style or appearance of specific digits over time.
    *   *Component Emergence/Disappearance:* Introducing new digits or removing existing ones from the dataset sequentially.
    *   *Composition Rule Drift:* Changing the spatial relationship or combination rule (e.g., from addition to subtraction semantics, or changing relative positioning).
2.  **Continual CLEVR (C-CLEVR-Seq):** Adapt the CLEVR dataset (Johnson et al., 2017) for visual reasoning.Introduce drifts such as:
    *   *Object Attribute Drift:* Changing the color or material distribution of specific object shapes over time.
    *   *New Object Introduction:* Adding new shapes, colors, or materials to the scenes.
    *   *Relational Drift:* Changing the frequency or nature of spatial relationships (e.g., "left of" becomes less common, a new relation "touching" appears). Tasks would involve answering questions about scenes generated from these evolving distributions.
3.  **Synthetic Procedural Generation:** Generate data streams with precisely controlled compositional drifts. For example, generating sequences based on symbolic rules where the primitive symbols or the rules themselves change over time.

Ground truth information about drift points and types will be available for these datasets, facilitating rigorous evaluation of drift detection and adaptation performance.

### 3.3 Composition-Aware Concept Drift Detection

Standard drift detectors often monitor the overall output distribution $P(Y|X)$ or input distribution $P(X)$. We propose to focus detection on the intermediate compositional representations, which should be more sensitive to underlying structural changes.

Let the base model learn component embeddings $\mathbf{z}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ for $k$ components present in an input $X$. Let $\mathcal{Z}_t = \{\mathbf{z}_{i,t}^{(j)}\}_{i=1..k_j, j=1..N_t}$ be the set of component embeddings extracted from a batch of $N_t$ data points at time $t$.

We will explore adapting representation-based drift detectors:

1.  **Component Distribution Monitoring:** Track the distribution of embeddings for each component type $i$ over time, $p_t(\mathbf{z}_i)$. Drift is detected if a distance metric between distributions across time windows, such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), exceeds a threshold:
    $$ \text{MMD}^2(p_t(\mathbf{z}_i), p_{t'}(\mathbf{z}_i)) = \left\| \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z}_i \sim p_t}[\phi(\mathbf{z}_i)] - \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z}_i' \sim p_{t'}}[\phi(\mathbf{z}_i')] \right\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2 > \epsilon $$
    where $\phi$ is a feature map induced by a kernel $k(\cdot, \cdot)$ in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space $\mathcal{H}$. This can detect changes in component appearance or semantics.
2.  **Contrastive Drift Detection (Inspired by MCD-DD):** Adapt contrastive learning approaches (Wan et al., 2024). Learn concept embeddings for component types or compositional patterns. Monitor the discrepancy between embeddings learned on reference (past) and test (current) windows to detect drift affecting specific compositional elements.
3.  **Reconstruction/Prediction Error Monitoring:** For generative or predictive compositional models, monitor the error per component or per compositional pattern. A sudden increase in error for specific components or combinations can signal drift.

The drift detector should ideally not only signal *that* drift occurred but also *where* (which components or relationships) to guide the adaptation process.

### 3.4 Incremental Component Learning

Triggered by drift detection, this module adapts the model's components (parameters $\phi$ associated with component extraction/representation). We will investigate and compare:

1.  **Parameter Regularization (e.g., EWC):** Suitable for gradual drift affecting existing components. Modify the loss function to penalize changes to parameters deemed important for previous components/tasks:
    $$ L(\phi) = L_{\text{new}}(\phi) + \lambda \sum_j F_{j} (\phi_j - \phi_{j, \text{old}})^2 $$
    where $L_{\text{new}}$ is the loss on the current data, $\phi_{j, \text{old}}$ are the old parameters, $F_j$ is the Fisher information matrix (or a diagonal approximation) measuring parameter importance for old components, and $\lambda$ controls the plasticity-stability trade-off. We will adapt this to apply component-wise importance estimation.
2.  **Generative Replay:** Suitable for more significant shifts or emergence of new components. Maintain a generative model $G(\mathbf{c})$ capable of sampling pseudo-data or component representations $\mathbf{z}_i^*$ corresponding to past concepts $\mathbf{c}$. During learning on new data $X_t$, interleave training with replayed samples $(\mathbf{z}_i^*, Y^*)$ to mitigate forgetting:
    $$ L(\phi, \theta) = \alpha L_{\text{new}}(X_t, Y_t; \phi, \theta) + (1-\alpha) L_{\text{replay}}(G(\mathbf{c}), Y^*; \phi, \theta) $$
    The generator itself might need adaptation if the nature of components changes drastically. We will explore methods to ensure the replay covers the necessary compositional diversity.
3.  **Architectural Adaptation (Parameter Isolation):** For discrete component emergence, dynamically add new modules or parameters dedicated to the new component, freezing parameters related to stable components. This avoids interference but can lead to model growth. Methods for parameter allocation and pruning will be considered.

The choice of method might depend on the type and severity of the detected drift.

### 3.5 Adaptive Composition Mechanisms

The function $f(\{\mathbf{z}_i\}; \theta)$ combining component representations $\{\mathbf{z}_i\}$ needs to adapt if the rules of composition change.

1.  **Incremental Update of Composition Parameters:** Treat the parameters $\theta$ of the composition function (e.g., attention network weights, GNN message passing layers) similarly to component parameters. Apply regularization (EWC on $\theta$) or replay-based updates to adapt $\theta$ continually.
2.  **Context-Dependent Composition:** Introduce mechanisms that make the composition process conditional on the current context or detected drift state. For example, using attention mechanisms where keys/queries are influenced by a drift signal or a time-dependent embedding:
    $$ \alpha_{ij} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{(W_Q \mathbf{z}_i)^T (W_K \mathbf{z}_j + W_C \mathbf{c}_t)}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) $$
    where $\mathbf{c}_t$ is a context vector representing the current time step or drift status.
3.  **Dynamic Routing/Mixture of Experts:** Employ multiple composition modules ($f_1, ..., f_M$) and a gating network $g(\{\mathbf{z}_i\}, \text{context})$ that dynamically selects or combines the outputs of these modules based on the input components and current state. The gating network itself can be adapted incrementally.

### 3.6 Experimental Design

**Baselines:**
*   **Static Compositional Model:** Train once on initial data, then evaluate on the entire stream (measures forgetting without adaptation).
*   **Full Retraining:** Retrain the model from scratch on all data available up to time $t$ (computationally expensive upper bound).
*   **Naive Fine-tuning:** Continuously fine-tune the compositional model on new data batches without any CL strategy (expected to suffer catastrophic forgetting).
*   **Standard CL Methods:** Apply generic CL methods (e.g., EWC, GEM, simple replay) to the entire compositional model without specific handling of components or composition rules.
*   **Oracle Model:** A model informed by ground-truth drift information to perform adaptation (provides an upper performance limit for the adaptation mechanism).

**Evaluation Metrics:**
*   **Average Task Performance:** Accuracy, F1, BLEU, etc., averaged over the entire data stream.
*   **Forgetting Measure:** Performance on previously learned tasks/components after learning new ones. Calculated as $F = \frac{1}{t-1} \sum_{i=1}^{t-1} (a_{t,i} - a_{i,i})$, where $a_{k,i}$ is the accuracy on task $i$ after learning task $k$. Lower is better.
*   **Forward Transfer:** Performance improvement on new tasks/components leveraging previously learned knowledge.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** Training time per batch, model size (parameter count), memory usage during training.
*   **Drift Detection Performance (where applicable):** Detection delay, True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR) against ground truth drift points.

**Ablation Studies:**
*   Evaluate the DCA-CCL framework with each major component (drift detection, incremental component learning, adaptive composition) disabled to assess their individual contributions.
*   Compare different drift detection algorithms within the framework.
*   Compare different incremental learning strategies (EWC vs. Replay vs. Architectural) for component adaptation.
*   Compare different adaptive composition mechanisms.

Experiments will be conducted on the C-MNIST-Seq, C-CLEVR-Seq, and synthetic datasets described earlier, covering various drift types (gradual/abrupt, component/rule changes). Statistical significance tests will be used to compare results.
