**Dynamic Component Adaptation for Continual Compositional Learning**

---

### **1. Introduction**

#### **Background**
Human cognitive systems inherently excel at decomposing complex problems into reusable components and recombining them flexibly to address novel scenarios—a capability known as *compositional reasoning*. Inspired by this, compositional learning in artificial intelligence seeks to empower machines with modular structures and relational operators that generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) examples. However, real-world environments are not stationary; concepts, relationships, and contexts evolve over time, necessitating *continual learning* (CL), where models adapt to sequences of tasks without catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Current compositional learning methods, while effective in static settings, struggle when primitives or their composition rules shift dynamically. For instance, a visual reasoning system trained on objects with specific attributes may fail if those attributes or spatial dependencies change over time. The dissonance between static compositional components and dynamic CL environments creates a critical gap.

#### **Research Objectives**
This work proposes **Dynamic Component Adaptation (DyCA)**, a framework enabling foundation models to sustain compositional generalization in non-stationary environments. Specifically:
1. **Objective 1 (Drift Detection):** Develop an unsupervised concept drift detection module tailored to compositional representations, identifying shifts in component semantics, relationships, or task distributions.
2. **Objective 2 (Incremental Learning):** Enable incremental updates to primitive components and composition mechanisms using generative replay and parameter isolation, ensuring knowledge retention while assimilating new primitives.
3. **Objective 3 (Adaptive Composition):** Introduce self-modifying composition operators (e.g., attention-based routing) that dynamically adjust to evolving data streams via meta-learning of structural rules.

#### **Significance**
The DyCA framework directly addresses the workshop’s inquiry into extending compositional learning to continual environments (Paths Forward) and bridges perspectives on modularity and generalization. By allowing models to revise their primitives and relational abstractions over time, DyCA can:
- Mitigate catastrophic forgetting in dynamic worlds.
- Enable lifelong adaptation to compositional novelty (e.g., new object-attribute pairings).
- Provide insights into the interplay between modularity and compositional reasoning under distributional shifts.

This research aligns with the workshop’s goal to identify transferable compositional learning methods and theoretical foundations for foundation models.

### **2. Methodology**

The DyCA framework integrates three modules: **(i) Concept Drift Detection**, **(ii) Incremental Component Learning**, and **(iii) Adaptive Composition Mechanism**. Here, we detail each component, algorithmic steps, and experimental validation design.

---

#### **2.1 Concept Drift Detection**

**Design Principles**:  
Existing drift detection methods (e.g., MCD-DD, DriftLens) operate on global input representations but are insufficient for identifying shifts in localized compositional components (e.g., changes to "red car" to "blue motorcycle" in vision). DyCA focuses on changes within the compositional graph—a latent structure of primitives and their relationships. We propose **Compositional Drift Detection (CDD)**, which:
1. Maps input data to a hierarchy of primitives (objects, actions, attributes).
2. Tracks distributional shifts in component embeddings and relational graphs.

**Algorithmic Steps**:
1. **Component Embedding Learning**: Train an object-centric model (e.g., SCOFF [1]) to extract primitives $ \mathcal{C} = \{c_1, c_2, \dots, c_N\} $ from input $ x $. Each component $ c_i \in \mathbb{R}^D $ is represented as an embedding in $ D $-dimensional space.
2. **Relational Graph Monitoring**: For every input $ x $, construct a relational graph $ G_x = (V_x, E_x) $, where $ V_x $ contains primitives $ c_i $ and $ E_x $ encodes pairwise relations (e.g., spatial, functional). Track changes in edge weights $ \alpha_{ij} $ over time using statistical tests.
3. **Drift Quantification**: At time step $ t $, compute the discrepancy between current and historical component distributions using **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)** [2]:
   $$
   \text{MMD}^2 = \|\mu_P(c_i^t) - \mu_Q(c_i)\|^2_{\mathcal{H}} = \frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{n,m} k(c_{i,n}^t, c_{i,m})
   $$
   where $ k $ is a kernel function in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space $ \mathcal{H} $. A drift is detected if $ \text{MMD}^2 > \theta $, where $ \theta $ is dynamically adjusted.

4. **Directional Drift Analysis**: Extend **Neighbor-Searching Discrepancy** [3] to measure changes in the decision boundary for specific primitives. For a drifted component $ c_i $, compute:
   $$
   \Delta_i = \frac{\partial \psi(\hat{y})}{\partial c_i} \Big|_{t-1} - \frac{\partial \psi(\hat{y})}{\partial c_i} \Big|_{t}
   $$
   where $ \psi(\hat{y}) $ is the model’s scoring function for output $ y $, and $ \Delta_i $ indicates the direction and magnitude of drift.

**Theoretical Foundation**:  
CDD leverages the observation that concept drift in compositional systems manifests as changes in the *relational graph* rather than marginal distribution shifts of raw data. By focusing on structured components, we differentiate between harmless virtual drift and harmful real drift, akin to [3].

#### **2.2 Incremental Component Learning**

**Design Principles**:  
When a drift is detected, DyCA must update/add components without forgetting. For example, if "red car" evolves into "blue motorcycle", the model should retain the "red" and "car" modules while creating "blue" and "motorcycle" primitives. We employ **Generative Replay** (to preserve past distributions) and **Parameter Isolation** (to limit parameter sharing).

**Algorithmic Steps**:
1. **Pruning Obsolete Components**: Use clustering on drifted component embeddings (e.g., k-means) to identify obsolete concepts. Freeze their parameters via adapters [4].
2. **Generative Replay**: Train a variational autoencoder (VAE) on historical components $ \mathcal{C}_{t-1} $ and relations $ \mathcal{R}_{t-1} $. At time $ t $, generate synthetic samples $ S_{\text{replay}} $ using:
   $$
   S_{\text{replay}} \sim p_{\theta}(c_i, \alpha_{ij} | z), \quad z \sim p(z)
   $$
   where $ z $ is a latent code and $ p_{\theta} $ is the generator.
3. **Curriculum Learning for New Components**: Add new primitives $ c'_i \in \mathcal{C}_t^{+} $ incrementally. Train a **Dynamic Sparse Module** [4] to sparsify connections between $ c'_i $ and existing relations.

**Mathematical Formulation**:  
The incremental learning loss combines task-specific loss $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} $, replay loss $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{replay}} $, and sparsity constraint $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{sparsity}} $:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{replay}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{sparsity}}
$$
where:
- $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} = \mathcal{L}(y_t, f_{\theta_t}(x_t)) $ on current data $ x_t $.
- $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{replay}} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \|\mu_G(c_i^k) - \mu_{\text{VAE}}(c_i^k)\|_2 $ (MMD between generator and historical embeddings).
- $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{sparsity}} = \|\alpha_{ij}\|_1 $ to enforce sparse updates to relational weights $ \alpha_{ij} $.

#### **2.3 Adaptive Composition Mechanism**

**Design Principles**:  
Composition rules (e.g., attention routing, hierarchical parsing) must adjust to novel component interactions. DyCA employs a **Meta-Compose Network**, which dynamically modifies composition operators using drift signals from CDD.

**Algorithmic Steps**:
1. **Meta-Learner for Composition Rules**: A small RNN $ \mathcal{M} $ receives drift metrics $ \Delta_i $ and generates new routing weights $ \beta_{ij} $.
2. **Self-Modifying Attention**: Revise transformer attention [5] to incorporate drift-driven dynamics:
   $$
   \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T + \sum_{k} \gamma_k \cdot \text{meta}_k(\Delta)}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
   $$
   where $ \text{meta}_k(\Delta) $ is a meta-rule modifying $ \gamma_k $ based on drift magnitude $ \Delta $. This allows attention to prioritize newly added components or relations.
3. **Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Drift-Gated Routing**: Adapt MoE layers by adding a gate:
   $$
   g_t = \sigma(W_{\text{gate}} \cdot \Delta + b_{\text{gate}})
   $$
   Select experts $ E_{\text{active}} = \{e_k \mid g_k > \tau\} $, where $ \tau $ balances plasticity and stability.

**Technical Innovations**:  
- The meta-compose network enables rule adaptation without re-training, unlike SCOFF [1].
- The self-modifying attention layer decouples composition from fixed relational graphs, enabling continual recombination of evolving primitives.

#### **2.4 Experimental Design**

**Datasets**:
1. **Synthetic Evolving Tasks**: Modify the **CLEVRER** dataset [6] to introduce temporal shifts in object attributes (e.g., changing "rubber cube" to "metal cube") and causal reasoning rules.
2. **Real-World Streams**: Use the **Continual ImageNet** benchmark [7] (progressive label changes in image classification) and **TED Talks** transcripts [8] (evolving semantic compositions in multilingual translation).

**Baselines**:
- Static compositional models: Transformer, SCOFF.
- CL-focused models: EWC, Rehearsal, AdapterDrop.
- Drift-aware models: MCD-DD [1], DriftLens [2], Sparse Dynamic Networks [4].

**Evaluation Metrics**:
1. **Task Performance**:
   - Accuracy, F1 for classification.
   - BLEU, ROUGE for generation tasks.
2. **Compositional Metrics**:
   - **Component Reuse Rate**: $ \text{CRR} = \frac{|\mathcal{C}_{\text{old}} \cap \mathcal{C}_{\text{new}}|}{|\mathcal{C}_{\text{new}}|} $.
   - **Compositionality Score**: Quantify the extent to which outputs rely on modular recombinations (e.g., using Hume et al.’s metric [9]).
3. **Continual Learning Metrics**:
   - **Stability-Plasticity Trade-Off** [10].
   - **Backward Transfer**: $ \Delta_{\text{BT}} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} A_{t-1}(x_t^{\text{old}}) - A_t(x_t^{\text{old}}) $, where $ A_t $ is accuracy.

**Implementation Details**:
- **Vision**: DyCA uses DETR [11] as the backbone, with sparse component heads.
- **Language**: Adapt BERT [5] with dynamic attention weights and a modular VAE for replay.
- **Training**: Alternating optimization—CDD operates at the batch level, triggering incremental learning phases.

### **3. Expected Outcomes and Impact**

#### **3.1 Outcomes**
1. A real-time drift detection framework achieving **80–90% precision** on evolving compositional benchmarks like CLEVRER and Continual ImageNet.
2. A dynamic composition mechanism that sustains **85%+ accuracy** on downstream tasks even after 10+ sequential domain shifts.
3. A quantitative demonstration of **reduced catastrophic forgetting** (F1 drop < 10% on old tasks) by integrating VAE replay and sparse module updates.

#### **3.2 Theoretical Contributions**
- Formalize a theory linking compositional drift to relational graph dynamics using causal frameworks [12].
- Empirically validate that modular architectures (e.g., MoE) with adaptive attention improve out-of-distribution generalization under CL constraints.

#### **3.3 Practical Impact**
1. **Scalable Continual Systems**: DyCA will enable real-world deployment of compositional models in dynamic settings (e.g., robotics with changing object physics, autonomous vehicles adapting to new traffic signs).
2. **Foundation Model Enhancements**: The framework is compatible with LLMs (e.g., GPT, PaLM) and vision transformers, offering drop-in improvements for compositional reasoning.
3. **Benchmarks for Evolving Compositionality**: We will release modified CLEVRER and TED datasets with controlled temporal shifts to spur future research in continual compositional learning.

#### **3.4 Long-Term Vision**
By addressing modularity’s limitations in non-stationary environments, DyCA advances the workshop’s agenda to unify theory (e.g., why foundation models succeed in compositional transfer) with methods (e.g., how to sustain compositionality). The framework could inspire new architectures where components are not learned in isolation but evolve as part of a "cognitive ecosystem" that adapts to changing distributional manifolds.

### **Conclusion**
This proposal outlines DyCA, a framework to enable compositional foundations models to thrive in continual learning environments. By unifying concept drift detection, incremental learning, and adaptive compositionality, DyCA directly tackles four workshop themes: identifying when foundation models fail (Perspectives), creating transferable methods (Methods), probing modularity’s limits (Methods and Perspectives), and solving CL-specific compositionality challenges (Paths Forward). The expected outcomes bridge critical gaps in scaling compositional reasoning to dynamic, real-world applications, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical deployment of foundation models.
