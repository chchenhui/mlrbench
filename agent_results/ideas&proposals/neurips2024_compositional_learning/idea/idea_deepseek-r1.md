**Title:** Modularity and Compositional Generalization: Bridging the Gap Between Structure and Function  

**Motivation:** Modular architectures (e.g., adapters, sparse networks) are widely adopted to enhance compositional learning, but their direct impact on generalization remains unproven. This research addresses a critical gap: whether structural modularity inherently improves compositional reasoning or merely serves as an indirect enabler. Clarifying this relationship is vital for guiding efficient model design and deployment in dynamic real-world scenarios.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a systematic evaluation framework to measure how different modular strategies (adapters, prompts, sparsity) affect compositional generalization across vision, language, and reinforcement learning tasks. Using controlled experiments, we will train models with varying modular components on tasks requiring systematic recombination (e.g., few-shot parsing, scene decomposition). Performance will be tested on out-of-distribution splits to assess generalization. Additionally, we will quantify "modularity" via metrics like parameter isolation and inter-module sparsity, correlating these with task performance. Theoretical analysis will explore whether modular structures align with compositional invariance principles. Expected outcomes include (1) empirical evidence linking specific modular designs to generalization gains, (2) failure modes where modularity alone is insufficient, and (3) guidelines for integrating modular components into foundation models. This work could redefine how modularity is leveraged for robust, interpretable AI systems.
