**Research Proposal: Dynamic Component Adaptation for Continual Compositional Learning**  
**Subtitle:** *Bridging Concept Drift Detection, Incremental Learning, and Adaptive Composition Mechanisms*

---

### **1. Introduction**

#### **Background**  
Compositional learning seeks to endow machines with the ability to decompose complex concepts into reusable primitives and recombine them systematically. Inspired by human cognition, this approach enables generalization to novel scenarios by leveraging previously learned components. Despite advances in fields like object-centric learning and compositional reasoning, modern models—including large language models (LLMs)—struggle in dynamic environments where component semantics or composition rules evolve over time. Continual learning settings exacerbate these challenges, leading to catastrophic forgetting (loss of old knowledge) or component obsolescence (failure to adapt to new patterns).

#### **Research Objectives**  
This research proposes **Dynamic Component Adaptation for Continual Compositional Learning (DCA-CCL)**, a framework to address three core challenges:  
1. **Detecting concept drift** in component semantics or relational rules within non-stationary data streams.  
2. **Incrementally updating components** using strategies that balance stability (retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).  
3. **Adapting composition mechanisms** to dynamically adjust how primitives are combined based on detected shifts.  

The proposed framework integrates ideas from concept drift detection, generative replay, and adaptive attention mechanisms to achieve robust continual compositional learning.

#### **Significance**  
Current compositional models assume static components or environments, limiting their applicability in real-world domains like robotics, adaptive NLP systems, and autonomous agents. DCA-CCL aims to bridge this gap by enabling lifelong adaptation, with applications in:  
- **Robotics**: Evolving object manipulation tasks with changing object properties.  
- **Machine Translation**: Handling shifts in slang or terminology over time.  
- **Healthcare**: Adapting diagnostic models to emerging disease patterns.

### **2. Methodology**

#### **2.1 Data Collection**  
We will design or adapt benchmarks across three domains to simulate dynamic compositional tasks:  

1. **Vision**: Extend CLEVR-Dynamic, a variant of CLEVR where objects gradually change appearance (e.g., color, shape) or relationships (e.g., spatial rules).  
2. **NLP**: Construct a text dataset with procedural tasks (e.g., "cooking recipes") where ingredient roles or preparation steps evolve over time.  
3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Use MiniGrid environments with dynamically reconfigurable object interaction rules.  

Each dataset will include explicit concept drift annotations (timestamps and types of drift) for validation.

#### **2.2 Dynamic Component Adaptation Framework**  
The framework comprises three interconnected modules:  

**1. Concept Drift Detection**  
Leverage **MCD-DD** (from arXiv:2407.05375) and **DriftLens** (arXiv:2406.17813) to identify shifts in components and composition rules.  
- **Step 1**: Contrastive learning encodes component embeddings:  
  $$ \mathbf{e}_c = f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_c), $$  
  where $f_\theta$ is a contrastive encoder trained to maximize similarity between components in similar contexts.  
- **Step 2**: Compute the Maximum Concept Discrepancy (MCD):  
  $$ \text{MCD}(t) = \max_{c \in \mathcal{C}} \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}} \left[ \mathcal{D}\left(\mathbf{e}_c^{(t)}, \mathbf{e}_c^{(t-\Delta t)}\right) \right], $$  
  where $\mathcal{D}$ is a distance metric (e.g., Wasserstein). A drift is flagged if $\text{MCD}(t) > \tau$.  

**2. Incremental Component Learning**  
To update components without forgetting, employ:  
- **Generative Replay**: A variational autoencoder (VAE) synthesizes pseudo-samples of old components during training.  
  $$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{replay}} = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim \mathcal{M}} \left[ \log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}) \right], $$  
  where $\mathcal{M}$ is the generative memory buffer.  
- **Parameter Isolation**: Allocate sparse subnetworks (masks) for new components via a gating mechanism:  
  $$ \mathbf{W}_{\text{new}} = \mathbf{W}_{\text{old}} \odot \mathbf{m} + \mathbf{W}_{\text{update}} \odot (1 - \mathbf{m}), $$  
  where $\mathbf{m} \in \{0,1\}^d$ is a binary mask learned to protect critical parameters.  

**3. Adaptive Composition Mechanisms**  
Modify cross-attention in transformer-based models to weight components dynamically based on drift signals:  
$$ \alpha_{ij} = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{\mathbf{q}_i (\mathbf{k}_j + \mathbf{d}_j)}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right), $$  
where $\mathbf{d}_j$ is a drift-aware vector computed from MCD values. Components with higher drift scores receive increased attention weights to prioritize recent patterns.  

#### **2.3 Experimental Design**  

**Baselines**: Compare against:  
- **EWC** (elastic weight consolidation), **GEM** (gradient episodic memory).  
- **Static Compositional Models** (e.g., MONet, Slot Attention).  

**Metrics**:  
- **Adaptability**: Forward transfer accuracy on new tasks.  
- **Stability**: Backward transfer accuracy on old tasks.  
- **Component Reuse Rate**: Fraction of reused components in novel compositions.  
- **Drift Detection F1**: Precision/recall of drift alerts.  

**Implementation**:  
- Train on NVIDIA A100 GPUs using PyTorch.  
- Ablation studies to isolate contributions of each module.

#### **Expected Outcomes**  
1. A unified framework for continual compositional learning with real-time concept drift detection.  
2. Empirical validation showing DCA-CCL outperforms baselines by ≥15% in adaptability metrics on dynamic benchmarks.

- **Societal**: Reduce the environmental cost of continuous model retraining by enabling efficient adaptation.

### **4. Conclusion**

By validating on multimodal benchmarks and providing open-source implementations, DCA-CCL aims to serve as a foundation for future research in lifelong learning systems capable of thriving in non-stationary real-world environments.
