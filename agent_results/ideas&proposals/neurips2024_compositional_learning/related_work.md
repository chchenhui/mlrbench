**Key Challenges:**

1. **Dynamic Component Adaptation**: Developing mechanisms that allow compositional learning models to adapt their primitive components and composition rules in response to evolving data streams without compromising previously learned knowledge.

2. **Concept Drift Detection**: Creating effective methods to identify and respond to shifts in component semantics or relationships within compositional representations, ensuring models remain accurate over time.

3. **Incremental Component Learning**: Implementing techniques such as generative replay or parameter isolation to update or add components incrementally, mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting.

4. **Adaptive Composition Mechanisms**: Designing flexible composition mechanisms, like attention or routing, that can adjust how components are combined based on new evidence, facilitating robust reasoning in non-stationary environments.

5. **Evaluation on Evolving Benchmarks**: Establishing benchmarks that feature evolving tasks or changing object appearances/relationships to effectively assess the performance of compositional learning models in dynamic settings.
