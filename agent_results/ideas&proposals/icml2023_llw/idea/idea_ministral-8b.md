### Title: **Decoupled Learning for Edge Computing**

### Motivation:
The increasing adoption of edge computing devices necessitates training models that can operate effectively on these resource-constrained environments. Current global end-to-end learning methods are inefficient due to their high memory footprint, synchronization requirements, and latency. Decoupled learning, which updates model parts independently, offers a promising approach to address these limitations.

### Main Idea:
This research proposal focuses on developing a decentralized training framework for edge devices using decoupled learning. The methodology involves partitioning the neural network into smaller, manageable modules that can be trained independently. Each module is updated based on local data and objectives, minimizing the need for synchronization and reducing memory requirements. By employing asynchronous model updates, the framework ensures low-latency training suitable for real-time applications such as streaming video analysis.

Expected outcomes include:
1. **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Reduced memory footprint and lower computational requirements, making the model suitable for deployment on edge devices.
2. **Improved Latency**: Asynchronous updates enable real-time learning and adaptation.
3. **Biologically Plausible Updates**: The decoupled approach mimics the local and asynchronous nature of biological synapses.

Potential impact:
This research will significantly enhance the scalability and efficiency of machine learning models on edge devices, paving the way for more widespread adoption of edge computing in various applications such as IoT, autonomous vehicles, and real-time analytics.
