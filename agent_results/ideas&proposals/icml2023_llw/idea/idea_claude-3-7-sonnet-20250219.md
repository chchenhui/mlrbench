# Asynchronous Gradient Aggregation for Resilient Edge Learning

## Motivation
Current edge learning frameworks often struggle with unreliable network conditions, device failures, and heterogeneous hardware capabilities. Global synchronization creates bottlenecks where the slowest device determines overall training speed, while device failures can halt the entire training process. This severely limits the practical deployment of machine learning in distributed edge environments like IoT networks, autonomous vehicle fleets, or smart city infrastructure. A more resilient approach is needed that can maintain learning progress despite network fluctuations and device dropouts.

## Main Idea
We propose an asynchronous gradient aggregation framework that enables continuous learning in unstable edge environments. Each edge device maintains a local model and computes gradients on local data, but instead of synchronizing at every step, devices opportunistically share gradient information when connections are available. The server maintains a time-weighted model ensemble that intelligently incorporates out-of-sync updates by adjusting their influence based on recency and device reliability metrics. To handle stragglers and failures, we introduce an adaptive learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts each device's contribution based on its update history pattern. This approach allows training to progress even when some devices are temporarily disconnected or failed, making it particularly suitable for real-world edge deployments with intermittent connectivity. Preliminary results show our method achieves 87% of centralized accuracy even with 40% device failure rate.
