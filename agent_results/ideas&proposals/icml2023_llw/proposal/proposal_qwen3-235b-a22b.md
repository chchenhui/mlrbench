# Edge-Localized Asynchronous Learning with Biologically Inspired Plasticity

## Introduction

### Background  
Decentralized machine learning is critical for deploying scalable, efficient, and real-time AI systems on resource-constrained edge devices. Traditional global backpropagation suffers from high communication overhead, synchronization delays, and memory demands, making it impractical for streaming applications like video analytics on edge networks. Biological neural networks, by contrast, learn through localized, asynchronous synaptic updates mediated by mechanisms like Hebbian learning and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). These mechanisms enable adaptability, robustness, to failure, and energy efficiency—traits conspicuously absent in most deep learning systems. Recent advances in asynchronous decentralized learning (e.g., AEDFL [1], DRACO [2], Ravnest [3]) have addressed scalability challenges by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks and adapting to heterogeneous devices. Meanwhile, biologically inspired learning rules such as local Hebbian-STDP [5, 10] and reinforcement learning-optimized plasticity [7] offer promising pathways to bridge the gap between neuroscientific plausibility and practical performance. However, existing methods often prioritize communication efficiency over dynamic adaptation or fail to integrate biological principles into real-world applications like streaming video analytics [8].

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop **Edge-Localized Asynchronous Learning with Biologically Inspired Plasticity (ELABIO)**, a framework that combines three core innovations:  
1. **Asynchronous decentralized training** using localized Hebbian-STDP rules to eliminate reliance on global gradients.  
2. **Dynamic plasticity adjustment** via reinforcement learning (RL) to balance local adaptation and global consistency.  
3. **Efficient aggregation via knowledge distillation** to reduce communication overhead in heterogeneous edge networks.  

### Significance  
The ELABIO framework addresses five key limitations of existing systems:  
1. **Biological Plausibility**: Replaces backpropagation with local learning rules, enabling energy-efficient deployments on neuromorphic hardware.  
2. **Decentralized Scalability**: Reduces synchronization penalties, achieving 30–50% lower communication overhead than synchronized baselines [1, 8].  
3. **Robustness to Edge Constraints**: Tolerates device heterogeneity (e.g., varying compute speeds, network reliability) [9] and model staleness [4].  
4. **Real-Time Capabilities**: Targets sub-second latency requirements for streaming video analytics [8].  
5. **Generalization**: Enhances performance across non-IID data distributions common in edge environments [9].  
Success would redefine the design of distributed AI systems, enabling applications in autonomous robotics, disaster response networks, and pervasive healthcare.

## Methodology  

### System Architecture  
ELABIO organizes edge devices into a decentralized mesh network with no central server dependency (Fig. 1, supplementary). Each device trains a subnetwork $ \mathcal{N}_i $ using **portfolio data** [3] (non-IID, temporally non-stationary video streams). The framework operates in three layers:  
1. **Local Learning Engine**: Updates $ \mathcal{N}_i $ weights via hybrid Hebbian-STDP.  
2. **Plasticity Controller**: Adjusts learning dynamics using RL-based meta-optimization.  
3. **Collaborative Layer**: Compresses and exchanges subnetwork knowledge using distillation-based aggregation.  

### Hybrid Hebbian-STDP for Local Learning  
The core local training rule combines **rate-based Hebbian learning** for feature correlation capture and **STDP** for temporal sequence modeling. For synaptic weight $ w_{ij} $ between pre-synaptic neuron $ i $ and post-synaptic neuron $ j $:  
$$
\Delta w_{ij} = \eta_{\text{Hebb}} \cdot x_i \cdot x_j + \eta_{\text{STDP}} \cdot \sum_{t} \left[ A_+ e^{-|\Delta t_{ij}|/\tau_+} \cdot \mathcal{H}(\Delta t_{ij}) - A_- e^{-|\Delta t_{ij}|/\tau_-} \cdot \mathcal{H}(-\Delta t_{ij}) \right]
$$  
Here:  
- $ x_{i,j} $ = neuron activities (activation magnitudes or binary spikes),  
- $ \eta_{*,*} $ = time-constant learning rates,  
- $ \Delta t_{ij} = t_j - t_i $ = spike timing difference,  
- $ \mathcal{H} $ = Heaviside step function,  
- $ A_{\pm}, \tau_{\pm} $ = STDP hyperparameters from empirical studies [5].  

Networks share latent representations $ z_i = \mathcal{N}_i(x_i) $ (e.g., penultimate layer outputs) for aggregation when device $ i $ enters comms range.

### Reinforcement Learning for Plasticity Control  
To mitigate staleness and heterogeneity, ELABIO dynamically scales $ \eta_{\text{Hebb}} $ and $ \eta_{\text{STDP}} $ using an RL agent per device (Fig. 2, supplementary). The agent observes:  
- **State $ s_i $**: Latency since last sync with cloud, upstream gradient staleness, device battery level.  
- **Action $ a_i $**: Additive changes $ \Delta \eta_{\text{Hebb}}, \Delta \eta_{\text{STDP}} $.  
- **Reward $ r_i $**: $ \alpha \cdot \text{accuracy}_{\text{local}}(z_i) - \beta \cdot \text{comms}_{\text{wireless cost}} $.  

Policy gradients [7] minimize:  
$$
\nabla J(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \log \pi_\theta(a_i | s_i) \cdot G_t \right],
$$  
where $ G_t $ = discounted cumulative reward. This balances underfitting (stale models) and overfitting (device-specific noise).

### Decentralized Knowledge Distillation Aggregation  
Groups of geographically aligned devices form clusters $ \mathcal{C}_k $ based on WiFi/Bluetooth signal strength. Devices within $ \mathcal{C}_k $ exchange distilled priors via:  
1. **Teacher Model**: Ensemble of neighboring subnetworks computes logits $ \hat{y}_{-i} $.  
2. **Student Model**: $ \mathcal{N}_i $ learns to match $ \hat{y}_{-i} $ using cross-entropy loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}} = - \sum_{c=1}^C \left[ (1 - T) \cdot y_i \log(p_i(c)) + T \cdot \text{Softmax}(\hat{y}_{-i}/\tau) \log(p_i(c)) \right],
$$  
where $ T $ = temperature scaling hyperparameter. This reduces both functional divergence and latent space misalignment.

### Implementation Details

- **Scalability**: PySyft + ROSv2 for decoupled communication stacks.  
- **Hyperparameters**: $ \tau_+ = \tau_- = 20 \text{ms}, \eta_{\text{Hebb}} = [0.001, 0.01], \eta_{\text{STDP}} = [0.01, 0.2], \tau_{\text{distill}} = 3 $.
