**Multimodal Attention Fusion for Enhanced Time Series Forecasting in the Era of Foundation Models**

### 2. Introduction  

#### Background  
Time series forecasting is critical in domains such as energy, healthcare, and finance, where accurate predictions enable proactive decision-making. Traditional models like ARIMA and modern deep learning approaches (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers) primarily focus on numerical time series data, often ignoring contextual information from other modalities such as text, images, or categorical metadata. This limitation becomes pronounced during anomalous events (e.g., market crashes, pandemics), where external factors captured through multimodal data could provide critical signals.  

Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) have demonstrated their ability to generalize across tasks by leveraging pretraining on large-scale datasets. However, applying these models to time series analysis remains underexplored. While recent works like *Time-VLM* (Zhong et al., 2025) and *Modality-aware Transformer* (Emami et al., 2023) have begun integrating multimodal data, challenges persist in dynamically weighting modalities, handling data heterogeneity, and ensuring computational efficiency.  

#### Research Objectives  
This research aims to:  
1. Develop a novel architecture that fuses numerical time series data with contextual information from text, images, and metadata using **cross-modal attention mechanisms**.  
2. Design an **adaptive weighting module** to dynamically adjust the influence of each modality based on data quality and relevance.  
3. Validate the model’s ability to improve forecasting accuracy, particularly during regime changes or anomalous events, through extensive experiments on real-world datasets.  
4. Provide interpretability into how different modalities contribute to predictions.  

#### Significance  
By integrating pretrained FMs from NLP and CV into time series forecasting, this work will advance the development of multimodal foundation models for temporal data. The proposed framework will enable more robust predictions in dynamic environments, with applications in healthcare (e.g., patient monitoring), energy (e.g., demand forecasting), and finance (e.g., risk assessment). Additionally, the insights into modality fusion and adaptive weighting will inform future research on scalable and interpretable time series models.

### 3. Methodology  

#### Research Design  
The proposed architecture, **Multimodal Adaptive Fusion Transformer (MAFT)**, consists of four components:  
1. **Modality-Specific Encoders**  
2. **Cross-Modal Attention Fusion**  
3. **Adaptive Modality Weighting**  
4. **Forecasting Head**  

##### 3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
**Datasets**:  
- **TimeText Corpus (TTC)** (Kim et al., 2024): Combines climate and healthcare time series with aligned text.  
- **M5 Competition Data**: Retail sales data with product metadata and promotional text.  
- **Financial Datasets**: Stock prices paired with earnings call transcripts and news articles.  

**Preprocessing**:  
- **Temporal Alignment**: Use timestamps to synchronize multimodal inputs.  
- **Missing Data**: Impute missing values in time series via linear interpolation; use dropout for text/image modalities to simulate real-world noise.  
- **Normalization**: Standardize numerical time series; tokenize text with BERT’s tokenizer; resize images to 224x224 pixels.  

##### 3.2 Modality-Specific Encoders  
- **Time Series Encoder**: A **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)** with dilated convolutions to capture long-term dependencies:  
  $$ \mathbf{H}_t = \text{TCN}(\mathbf{X}_{t-L:t}) $$  
  where $\mathbf{X}_{t-L:t}$ is the input window of length $L$.  
- **Text Encoder**: A pretrained **BERT** model to generate embeddings from textual metadata:  
  $$ \mathbf{H}_\text{text} = \text{BERT}(\mathbf{T}_{t-L:t}) $$  
- **Image Encoder**: A pretrained **ViT** (Vision Transformer) for visual data:  
  $$ \mathbf{H}_\text{img} = \text{ViT}(\mathbf{I}_{t-L:t}) $$  

##### 3.3 Cross-Modal Attention Fusion  
A **hierarchical attention mechanism** computes interactions between modalities:  
1. **Intra-Modal Attention**: For each modality, self-attention refines features:  
   $$ \mathbf{H}_m' = \text{MultiHeadAttn}(\mathbf{Q}_m, \mathbf{K}_m, \mathbf{V}_m) $$  
2. **Cross-Modal Attention**: Time series features act as queries to attend to text/image features:  
   $$ \mathbf{H}_{\text{fused}} = \text{MultiHeadAttn}(\mathbf{Q}_t, \mathbf{K}_\text{text}, \mathbf{V}_\text{text}) + \text{MultiHeadAttn}(\mathbf{Q}_t, \mathbf{K}_\text{img}, \mathbf{V}_\text{img}) $$  

##### 3.4 Adaptive Modality Weighting  
A learnable gating mechanism computes modality-specific weights $\alpha_m$:  
$$ \alpha_m = \text{Softmax}(\mathbf{W}_g [\mathbf{H}_t; \mathbf{H}_\text{text}; \mathbf{H}_\text{img}]) $$  
The final representation is a weighted sum:  
$$ \mathbf{H}_\text{final} = \alpha_t \mathbf{H}_t + \alpha_\text{text} \mathbf{H}_\text{text} + \alpha_\text{img} \mathbf{H}_\text{img} $$  

##### 3.5 Forecasting Head  
A **Transformer Decoder** generates $T$-step predictions:  
$$ \hat{\mathbf{X}}_{t+1:t+T} = \text{Decoder}(\mathbf{H}_\text{final}) $$  

##### 3.6 Experimental Design  
**Baselines**:  
- Statistical models: ARIMA, Prophet  
- Deep learning: LSTMs, TCNs  
- Multimodal models: Modality-aware Transformer (Emami et al., 2023), Time-VLM (Zhong et al., 2025)  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
- **Forecasting Accuracy**: MAE, RMSE, MASE  
- **Anomaly Detection**: F1-score, Precision@K during anomalous periods  
- **Computational Efficiency**: Training time, inference latency  

**Ablation Studies**:  
- Remove adaptive weighting.  
- Disable cross-modal attention.  
- Replace pretrained encoders with randomly initialized ones.  

**Datasets**: Evaluate on TTC (climate/healthcare), M5 (retail), and a financial dataset (stock prices + news).

### 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

#### Expected Outcomes  
1. **Improved Forecasting Accuracy**: MAFT is expected to outperform unimodal and existing multimodal baselines by 10–15% in MAE/RMSE during anomalous events, as validated on TTC and financial datasets.  
2. **Interpretable Modality Contributions**: The adaptive weights $\alpha_m$ will reveal which modalities are prioritized during specific events (e.g., text during earnings calls).  
3. **Robustness to Noisy Data**: The gating mechanism will mitigate performance degradation from low-quality modalities.  

#### Impact  
- **Scientific Community**: MAFT will advance multimodal time series research by providing a flexible framework for integrating foundation models. The code and pretrained models will be open-sourced.  
- **Industry**: Deployable in real-world systems (e.g., demand forecasting tools that adapt to social media trends).  
- **Societal Benefits**: Enhanced healthcare predictions could improve patient outcomes; accurate energy forecasts may reduce waste.

### 5. Conclusion  
This proposal addresses the critical challenge of integrating multimodal data into time series forecasting through a novel architecture that leverages cross-modal attention and adaptive weighting. By combining the strengths of foundation models from NLP/CV with dynamic fusion mechanisms, MAFT has the potential to redefine how temporal data is analyzed in complex, real-world scenarios. The outcomes will contribute to both academic research and practical applications, aligning with the workshop’s goal of advancing time series analysis in the age of large models.
