# Multimodal Attention Fusion for Enhanced Time Series Forecasting in the Age of Large Models  

## Introduction  

### Background  
Time series forecasting has traditionally relied on numerical data alone, employing statistical models (e.g., ARIMA) or specialized deep learning architectures (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers) to capture temporal dependencies. While modern foundation models like PatchTST or Autoformer have improved scalability and accuracy, they often ignore contextual signals from modalities such as text (e.g., news articles), images (e.g., satellite data), or categorical metadata (e.g., geopolitical events) that can strongly influence system dynamics. Recent studies highlight the potential of multimodal integration—e.g., Time-VLM shows vision-language models (VLMs) enhance forecasting during anomalous periods—yet no framework systematically addresses:  
1. **Dynamic cross-modal attention** to prioritize relevant contextual signals during regime changes.  
2. **Adaptive modality weighting** to mitigate missing/unreliable data across modalities.  
3. **Interpretability** in multimodal forecasting decisions.  

### Research Objectives  
This study aims to develop a **Multimodal Attention Fusion Network (MAF-Net)** with three key components:  
1. **Modality-specific encoders**: Leverage pre-trained transformers (e.g., BERT for text, CLIP for images) to extract contextual embeddings.  
2. **Cross-modal attention module**: Dynamically compute interactions between numerical time series and auxiliary modalities.  
3. **Adaptive weighting mechanism**: Learn modality importance through temporal-signal-driven parameters, scaling weights during anomalous events.  

### Significance  
- **Theoretical impact**: Advances attention mechanisms for heterogeneous modality integration.  
- **Practical applications**: Critical for domains like energy (forecasting demand amid geopolitical events) or healthcare (predicting hospitalizations with epidemiological reports).  
- **Dataset benchmarking**: We will release a curated multimodal time series dataset spanning finance, climate, and transportation.

## Methodology  

### Architecture Overview  
MAF-Net comprises:  
1. **Modality-specific encoders** for numerical series, text, and images.  
2. **Temporal encoder** for numerical data using PatchTST.  
3. **Cross-modal attention module** (see Section 2.3).  
4. **Adaptive fusion layer** combining modality embeddings.  
5. **Forecasting head** with probabilistic outputs.  

```math
\mathcal{F}(X_{\text{num}}, X_{\text{text}}, X_{\text{img}}) \rightarrow \hat{P}(y_{t+1}|y_{\leq t}, X_{\leq t})
$$
where $X_{\text{num}}, X_{\text{text}}, X_{\text{img}}$ are numerical, textual, and image sequences.  

### Data Collection and Preparation  
1. **TimeText Corpus (TTC)**: A re-purposed and extended version of the dataset from *Multi-Modal Forecaster*[4], covering climate and healthcare domains.  
2. **Financial Time Series with News**: S&P 500 prices fused with Bloomberg headlines processed using FinBERT[2].  
3. **Energy Demand with Satellite Imagery**: European load data synchronized with daily Sentinel-2 land usage images.  

Preprocessing steps include:  
- **Numerical series**: Z-score normalization and patching[5] into segments (e.g., 16-step patches).  
- **Text**: Tokenize with BERT and extract [CLS] embeddings.  
- **Images**: Encode with CLIP[6] to get visual embeddings.  

### Algorithmic Design  

#### 1. Temporal Encoder  
For numerical data $\mathbf{X}_{\text{num}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times d}$, use PatchTST’s positional self-attention:  
$$
\mathbf{Q} = \text{W}_Q\mathbf{X}_{\text{patched}}, \quad \mathbf{K} = \text{W}_K\mathbf{X}_{\text{patched}}, \quad \mathbf{V} = \text{W}_V\mathbf{X}_{\text{patched}}
$$
$$
\text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)\mathbf{V}
$$

#### 2. Cross-Modal Attention  
For text-numerical interaction, define:  
$$
\text{CrossAttn}_{\text{text}} = \text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}_{\text{num}}, \mathbf{K}_{\text{text}}, \mathbf{V}_{\text{text}})
$$  
Similar for vision-numerical:  
$$
\text{CrossAttn}_{\text{vision}} = \text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}_{\text{num}}, \mathbf{K}_{\text{vision}}, \mathbf{V}_{\text{vision}})
$$  
This allows the model to attend to textual/visual context relevant to specific numerical patterns.  

#### 3. Adaptive Fusion  
Compute modality weights $\alpha = [\alpha_{\text{num}}, \alpha_{\text{text}}, \alpha_{\text{vision}}]$ via:  
$$
\alpha_i = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{W}_{\alpha} \cdot \text{LSTM}(\mathbf{h}_{\text{temporal}}))
$$
Final embedding:  
$$
\mathbf{H}_{\text{fusion}} = \alpha_{\text{num}}\mathbf{H}_{\text{num}} + \alpha_{\text{text}}\mathbf{H}_{\text{text}} + \alpha_{\text{vision}}\mathbf{H}_{\text{vision}}
$$  

### Training and Evaluation  

#### Training Strategy  
- **Loss function**: Combine $L_1$+CRPS (Continuous Ranked Probability Score) for probabilistic forecasting.  
- **Optimization**: AdamW optimizer with cosine decay (initial LR: 5e-5).  
- **Transfer learning**: Freeze BERT/CLIP for the first 10 epochs.  

#### Baselines  
1. **Unimodal PatchTST**: Numerical-only Transformer.  
2. **Hybrid-MMF**[4]: Joins text and numbers via early fusion.  
3. **Time-VLM**[2]: Vision-language augmented Transformer.  

#### Evaluation Metrics  
| Metric | Description |  
|--------|-------------|  
| MAE | Mean Absolute Error |  
| RMSE | Root Mean Squared Error |  
| CRPS | Calibration of probabilistic forecasts |  
| MAPE | Mean Absolute Percentage Error (for energy datasets) |  

#### Ablation Studies  
1. Remove cross-modal attention to assess its role.  
2. Replace adaptive fusion with fixed weights ($\alpha=[0.33, 0.33, 0.33]$).  
3. Test sensitivity to missing modalities (e.g., 30% text dropout).  

#### Computational Efficiency  
Measure inference time (ms/forecast) and memory footprint (GB) to compare MAF-Net with multimodal baselines.

## Expected Outcomes and Impact  

### Anticipated Results  
1. **Improved forecasting accuracy**:  
   - 15–20% lower MAE during anomalous periods (e.g., oil price shocks), leveraging contextual signals from news/satellite imagery.  
   - CRPS reduction of ≥25% in probabilistic weather forecasting benchmarks.  

2. **Robustness to missing data**:  
   - Adaptive fusion sustains ≥90% baseline performance when 50% of image/text inputs are masked, surpassing fixed-weight methods.  

3. **Interpretability**:  
   - Cross-attention maps will show, for example, heightened text weight during U.S. Federal Reserve announcements impacting stock prices.  

### Societal and Scientific Impact  
1. **Domain-specific applications**:  
   - **Healthcare**: Detect surges in hospitalizations by analyzing clinical notes.  
   - **Energy**: Predict demand shifts using satellite data on construction activity.  

2. **Benchmarking contribution**:  
   - Release of **MultiTime-5M**, a multimodal dataset spanning finance ($T=3.6K$), climate ($T=1.2K$), and energy ($T=8K$) with synchronized modalities.  

3. **Theoretical advances**:  
   - Formalize adaptive modality weighting as a function of temporal uncertainty, advancing multimodal learning in non-stationary environments.  

### Future Directions  
Extend MAF-Net to handle:  
- **Asynchronous modalities** (e.g., text arriving at irregular intervals).  
- **Multimodal anomaly detection** through attention-based root-cause analysis.  
- **Scalable training** via cross-modal distillation to reduce reliance on large pre-trained models.
