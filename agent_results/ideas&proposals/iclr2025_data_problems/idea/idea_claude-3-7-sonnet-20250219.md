# Fair Data Attribution Framework for Foundation Models

## Motivation
As foundation models increasingly utilize vast datasets, the lack of proper attribution mechanisms raises significant ethical and legal concerns. Content creators whose work is used in training these models rarely receive recognition or compensation. This issue has led to copyright disputes and concerns about exploitation of creative works. A systematic framework for attribution is crucial not only for legal compliance but also for building trust with content creators and enabling transparent data marketplaces where value can be fairly distributed to those who contribute to model development.

## Main Idea
The proposed framework combines model-based and dataset-based attribution techniques to create a comprehensive data attribution system for foundation models. The approach uses influence functions modified for large-scale models to trace output generations back to specific training examples, complemented by a confidence scoring mechanism that quantifies attribution certainty. We'll develop a layered attribution system that functions at different granularities: exact content matching, stylistic influence detection, and conceptual attribution. The framework will include practical tooling for model developers to implement attribution during training with minimal computational overhead, and an accessible API for content creators to query models about the use of their work. This will enable fair compensation models in data marketplaces and provide transparency that helps address copyright concerns while creating sustainable ecosystems between AI developers and content creators.
