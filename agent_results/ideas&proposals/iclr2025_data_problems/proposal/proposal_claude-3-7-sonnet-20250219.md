# InfluenceSpace: Hierarchical Influence-Driven Curation for Multi-Modal Foundation Models

## 1. Introduction

Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized machine learning by demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks through pre-training on vast datasets. This is particularly evident in multi-modal FMs that integrate information across different modalities such as text, images, audio, and video. However, the effectiveness of these models is intrinsically tied to the quality, diversity, and balance of their training data. As FMs continue to scale in complexity and application scope, several critical data-related challenges have emerged, including redundancy, noise, bias, and inefficient resource utilization.

Traditional data curation approaches for multi-modal FMs often rely on simplistic heuristics such as deduplication, length-based filtering, and basic content moderation. These methods, while computationally efficient, fail to capture the nuanced impact that individual data points or groups of similar data have on model performance across different tasks and modalities. This gap is especially pronounced in multi-modal settings, where understanding cross-modal relationships is essential for effective curation.

The increasing computational and environmental costs associated with training large-scale FMs make efficient data curation not just beneficial but necessary. Recent work by Kwon et al. (2023) has demonstrated that influence functions can effectively identify important training examples in large language models. However, extending these insights to multi-modal contexts presents unique challenges due to the heterogeneous nature of the data and the complex interactions between modalities.

This research aims to address these challenges by developing InfluenceSpace, a hierarchical influence-driven framework for curating multi-modal training data. Our approach leverages cross-modal embeddings to cluster semantically similar data points and employs efficient influence function approximations to assess the impact of these clusters on downstream performance. By iteratively refining the training corpus based on these influence metrics, we can create more compact, balanced, and effective datasets for training multi-modal FMs.

The significance of this research is threefold. First, it offers a principled approach to data curation that directly optimizes for model performance rather than relying on proxy heuristics. Second, it provides a scalable framework that can handle the massive datasets required for modern FMs while maintaining computational tractability. Third, it addresses issues of fairness and representation by identifying and up-weighting underrepresented but influential data clusters, potentially mitigating biases that plague current models.

By developing this framework, we contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and fairness of multi-modal FMs, addressing key challenges highlighted in the evolving landscape of foundation model research.

## 2. Methodology

Our research methodology is structured around the development and evaluation of the InfluenceSpace framework for multi-modal data curation. The framework follows a two-stage pipeline that combines efficient clustering with influence-based assessment to identify the most valuable training examples. Here, we detail our approach to data collection, algorithmic implementation, and experimental validation.

### 2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing

We will utilize a diverse collection of multi-modal datasets spanning vision-language pairs:

1. **CC3M and CC12M**: Common Crawl-based image-caption pairs that serve as standard pre-training data for vision-language models.
2. **LAION-400M**: A subset of the LAION dataset containing image-text pairs filtered for English language content.
3. **Conceptual Captions**: A dataset of 3.3M image-caption pairs with cleaned and anonymized captions.

For preprocessing, we will:
1. Apply standard image transformations (resizing, normalization)
2. Tokenize text using a consistent tokenizer (e.g., CLIP's tokenizer)
3. Perform basic filtering to remove corrupted images and empty texts
4. Extract metadata including source, modality quality scores, and demographic indicators where available

### 2.2 Cross-Modal Embedding and Clustering

The first stage of our pipeline focuses on efficiently organizing the multi-modal data space:

1. **Joint Embedding Generation**: We will utilize a pre-trained multi-modal model (e.g., CLIP, FLAVA) to generate embeddings $e_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ for each data point $x_i$. For vision-language pairs, we compute:

   $$e_i = \alpha \cdot f_{text}(x_i^{text}) + (1 - \alpha) \cdot f_{image}(x_i^{image})$$

   Where $f_{text}$ and $f_{image}$ are the respective encoders, and $\alpha$ is a weighting parameter that will be empirically determined.

2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: To manage scale, we employ a hierarchical clustering approach:
   
   a. Apply mini-batch k-means to partition the embedding space into $K$ initial clusters:
   
   $$C = \{C_1, C_2, ..., C_K\}$$
   
   Where each cluster $C_k$ contains similar multi-modal examples.
   
   b. For each cluster $C_k$, compute a centroid $\mu_k$:
   
   $$\mu_k = \frac{1}{|C_k|} \sum_{x_i \in C_k} e_i$$
   
   c. Recursively apply clustering to large clusters that exceed a threshold size:
   
   $$\text{if } |C_k| > \tau \text{ then } C_k \rightarrow \{C_{k,1}, C_{k,2}, ..., C_{k,m}\}$$

3. **Cluster Representation**: For computational efficiency, we select representative examples from each cluster:
   
   $$R_k = \{x_i \in C_k : \|e_i - \mu_k\| \leq \delta\}$$
   
   Where $\delta$ is a distance threshold to ensure representatives are close to the centroid.

### 2.3 Influence Function Computation

The second stage involves computing influence scores to quantify each cluster's impact:

1. **Low-Rank Hessian Approximation**: To make influence computation tractable for large models, we employ a low-rank approximation of the Hessian:
   
   $$H_\theta \approx \sum_{j=1}^r \lambda_j v_j v_j^T + \lambda_0 I$$
   
   Where $\lambda_j$ and $v_j$ are eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and $\lambda_0$ accounts for the remaining spectrum.

2. **Cluster Influence Estimation**: For each cluster $C_k$, we compute an aggregate influence score with respect to a validation set $\mathcal{V}$:
   
   $$I(C_k, \mathcal{V}) = \frac{1}{|R_k|} \sum_{x_i \in R_k} \sum_{x_v \in \mathcal{V}} I(x_i, x_v)$$
   
   Where the individual influence $I(x_i, x_v)$ is computed as:
   
   $$I(x_i, x_v) = -\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(x_v, \theta)^T H_\theta^{-1} \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(x_i, \theta)$$
   
   Using the approximated Hessian inverse.

3. **Amortized Computation**: To further improve efficiency, we adopt a mini-batch approximation:
   
   $$\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(x_i, \theta) \approx \frac{1}{B} \sum_{j=1}^B \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(x_j, \theta)$$
   
   Where $x_j$ represents samples from the same cluster as $x_i$.

### 2.4 Iterative Data Curation

Based on the computed influence scores, we implement an iterative curation strategy:

1. **Pruning Low-Influence Clusters**: Remove clusters with negligible or negative influence:
   
   $$\mathcal{D}_{pruned} = \{x_i \in \mathcal{D} : x_i \in C_k \text{ and } I(C_k, \mathcal{V}) > \tau_{min}\}$$

2. **Re-weighting High-Influence Clusters**: Assign importance weights to retained clusters:
   
   $$w_k = \frac{I(C_k, \mathcal{V})^\gamma}{\sum_j I(C_j, \mathcal{V})^\gamma}$$
   
   Where $\gamma$ is a temperature parameter controlling the weight distribution.

3. **Diversity Preservation**: To maintain diversity, we ensure representation across the embedding space by enforcing a minimum selection threshold per major region:
   
   $$\forall \text{ regions } S_m : |\{C_k \in S_m : C_k \in \mathcal{D}_{final}\}| \geq \eta_m$$

4. **Fairness Adjustment**: Identify underrepresented but high-influence clusters for up-weighting:
   
   $$w_k' = w_k \cdot (1 + \beta \cdot \mathbb{1}[C_k \in \mathcal{U}])$$
   
   Where $\mathcal{U}$ is the set of underrepresented clusters based on metadata analysis.

5. **Iterative Refinement**: Repeat the process with progressively refined data:
   
   a. Train a small proxy model on the curated dataset
   b. Re-compute embeddings and influence scores
   c. Update cluster weights and prune further if necessary

### 2.5 Experimental Design

2. **Evaluation Protocol**: For each curation method, we will:
   a. Create datasets at varying retention rates (10%, 25%, 50%, 75% of original)

   - Training Convergence: Steps to reach 90% of maximum performance
   - FLOPs required for training to target performance

3. **Fairness and Representation**:
   - Equal Opportunity Difference across demographic groups
   - Representation disparity: $RD = \max_i \max_j |\frac{P_i - P_j}{P_i}|$ for groups $i,j$
   - Consistency of performance across subgroups

4. **Influence Accuracy**:
   - Correlation between predicted influence and actual performance impact
   - Precision of identifying harmful examples (negative influence)
