**Research Proposal: InfluenceSpace: Hierarchical Influence-Driven Data Curation for Enhanced Multi-Modal Foundation Models**

---

### 1. **Introduction**

**Background**  
Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized machine learning by leveraging massive datasets to achieve general-purpose capabilities across diverse tasks. However, the efficacy of these models heavily depends on the quality, diversity, and representativeness of their training data. Multi-modal FMs, which integrate text, image, and other modalities, face even greater challenges due to the inherent complexity of aligning heterogeneous data sources. Traditional data curation methods, such as heuristic filtering or random subsampling, are ill-suited for these models as they fail to systematically quantify the influence of individual data points or clusters on downstream performance. Redundancy, noise, and bias in training corpora further exacerbate resource inefficiency, slow convergence, and harm model fairness—issues that demand novel, scalable solutions.

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal aims to develop **InfluenceSpace**, a hierarchical influence-driven framework for multi-modal data curation. The objectives are:  
1. **Design a two-stage pipeline** to (i) cluster multi-modal data into semantically coherent groups and (ii) compute cluster-specific influence scores using efficient approximations.  
2. **Optimize training corpora** through iterative pruning of low-utility clusters and reweighting underrepresented but high-impact data.  
3. **Evaluate the framework** on vision-language benchmarks to quantify trade-offs between data efficiency, model accuracy, fairness, and training speed.  

**Significance**  
InfluenceSpace addresses critical gaps in large-scale FM development:  
- **Scalability**: By replacing per-sample influence analysis with cluster-level approximations, it reduces computational overhead.  
- **Fairness**: Dynamic reweighting mitigates bias by prioritizing underrepresented but influential data.  
- **Cross-modal alignment**: Joint embeddings ensure semantically meaningful clustering across modalities.  
This work bridges theoretical advances in data attribution (e.g., DataInf \cite{datainf}) with practical challenges in multi-modal model evaluation (e.g., HEMM \cite{hemm}), fostering interdisciplinary progress in data-centric AI.

### 2. **Methodology**

#### **2.1 Cross-Modal Embedding and Hierarchical Clustering**  
**Embedding Space Construction**:  
Leverage pre-trained multi-modal encoders (e.g., FLAVA \cite{flava}) to map input data $z_i = (x_i^{text}, x_i^{image})$ into a shared embedding space. For each sample, compute:  
$$
\mathbf{e}_i = f_\theta(x_i^{text}) \oplus g_\phi(x_i^{image}),
$$
where $\oplus$ denotes modality fusion via concatenation or attention-based pooling.  

**Clustering**:  
Apply hierarchical clustering on $\{\mathbf{e}_i\}$ using cosine similarity. Terminate clustering when the Davies-Bouldin index stabilizes, yielding $K$ clusters $\{C_1, ..., C_K\}$. This ensures semantic coherence within clusters and scalability to large datasets.  

#### **2.2 Amortized Influence Estimation**  
**Low-Rank Hessian Approximation**:  
To avoid computing the full Hessian matrix $H \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ (where $d$ is the model parameter count), approximate $H^{-1}$ via a rank-$r$ Nyström decomposition. For parameters $\theta$ and loss $L$, compute:  
$$
H \approx U \Lambda U^T, \quad U \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}, \Lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times r}.  
$$
**Mini-Batch Gradient Sampling**:  
For cluster $C_k$, compute its influence score $I(C_k)$ using randomly sampled mini-batches $B \subset C_k$:  
$$
I(C_k) = \frac{1}{|B|} \sum_{z_j \in B} \nabla_\theta L(z_j, \theta)^T H^{-1} \nabla_\theta L(z_{val}, \theta),
$$  
where $z_{val}$ is a validation sample. This amortizes computation across clusters while retaining accuracy.

#### **2.3 Iterative Pruning and Reweighting**  
1. **Prune Clusters**: Remove clusters with $I(C_k) < \tau_{low}$ (harmful/noisy) or $I(C_k) < \tau_{high}$ (redundant).  
2. **Reweight Clusters**: Apply a fairness-aware weighting scheme to increase sampling probability for underrepresented clusters with $I(C_k) > \tau_{high}$.  
3. **Iterate**: Repeat embedding, clustering, and scoring on the pruned/reweighted dataset until validation performance plateaus.

#### **2.4 Experimental Design**  
**Datasets**: Evaluate on COCO (image-text pairs), Visual Genome (scene graphs), and FairCV (bias-mitigation benchmark).  

**Baselines**: Compare against:  
- Random subsampling  
- Modality-specific curation (e.g., CLIPScore filtering)  
- DataInf \cite{datainf} (per-sample influence)  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
- **Data Efficiency**: Volume reduction rate (VRR) = $\frac{\text{Pruned Data Size}}{\text{Original Data Size}}$  
- **Model Performance**: Accuracy on VQA, image-text retrieval (Recall@K)  
- **Fairness**: Disparity reduction (ΔDP) between majority/minority groups  
- **Training Efficiency**: Wall-clock time to convergence  

**Implementation**:  
- Pre-train a FLAVA-based model on the curated datasets.  
- Use PyTorch for gradient/Hessian computations and FAISS for clustering.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**:  
1. A **20–40% reduction in training data volume** without compromising model accuracy.  
2. **15–30% improvement in fairness metrics** (ΔDP) compared to heuristic curation.  
3. **1.5x faster convergence** due to noise reduction and gradient stability.  
4. Open-source implementation of InfluenceSpace for community adoption.  

**Impact**:  
- **Technical**: Provides a scalable, theoretically grounded framework for data curation in multi-modal FMs, addressing the "model collapse" and copyright challenges highlighted in recent literature.  
- **Societal**: Enhances AI fairness and safety by systematically mitigating dataset biases, aligning with goals outlined in Chameleon \cite{chameleon}.  
- **Community**: Establishes benchmarks for data-centric evaluation of FMs, extending the HEMM framework \cite{hemm}.
