**Title:** Hierarchical Physics-Informed Neural Operators for Cross-Scale Modeling of Complex Systems  

**Motivation:** Current multiscale modeling approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency with accuracy, limiting progress in high-impact domains like high-temperature superconductivity and climate prediction. Bridging scales from quantum to macroscopic phenomena requires universal, physics-aware AI methods that avoid ad-hoc approximations.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a hierarchical neural operator architecture that combines multi-resolution analysis (e.g., wavelets or Fourier transforms) with physics-informed constraints. The model will process inputs at progressively coarser scales, using attention mechanisms to propagate critical fine-scale interactions upward. Each layer enforces domain-specific conservation laws (e.g., energy, momentum) via differentiable loss terms. Training leverages hybrid data from simulations (e.g., DFT for atomic-scale, continuum models for macro-scale) and unsupervised objectives to ensure inter-scale consistency. Expected outcomes include a framework that accelerates simulations by 10–100× while preserving accuracy, validated on superconductivity (electron-phonon coupling) and turbulence modeling. Impact: Enables rapid exploration of design spaces for fusion reactors or novel materials, democratizing access to multiscale modeling.
