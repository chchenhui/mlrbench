**NeuroScale: Adaptive Neural Operators for Multiscale Modeling of Complex Systems**

### 1. Introduction  
**Background**  
Multiscale modeling of complex systems—from quantum interactions to climate dynamics—remains one of the most significant challenges in computational science. As Dirac noted in 1929, the fundamental equations governing physical systems are well-understood, but their direct simulation becomes intractable for systems of practical interest due to the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity. Breakthroughs like density functional theory and renormalization have enabled scale transitions in specific domains, but these methods are not generalizable across disciplines. Modern challenges, such as predicting high-temperature superconductivity or optimizing fusion plasma dynamics, demand universal frameworks that bridge scales while preserving physical fidelity.  

Recent advances in machine learning, particularly neural operators, offer promising tools for learning mappings between function spaces governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Works like EquiNO (Eivazi et al., 2025) and PIPNO (Yuan et al., 2025) demonstrate that neural operators can accelerate multiscale simulations by orders of magnitude. However, key limitations persist: (1) existing methods lack adaptive mechanisms to dynamically prioritize features across scales, (2) physical constraints are often enforced heuristically, and (3) uncertainty quantification during coarse-graining remains underexplored. These gaps hinder the reliability and generalizability of current approaches.  

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal introduces **NeuroScale**, a framework designed to overcome these limitations through three innovations:  
1. **Scale-adaptive attention mechanisms** to dynamically identify and weight features across spatial and temporal resolutions.  
2. **Physics-informed regularization** to enforce conservation laws (e.g., mass, energy) and symmetries (e.g., rotation invariance) across scales.  
3. **Uncertainty-aware coarse-graining** to quantify information loss during scale transitions and improve predictive reliability.  

**Significance**  
NeuroScale aims to establish a universal paradigm for multiscale modeling, enabling high-fidelity simulations at reduced computational costs. Success in this endeavor would directly impact high-priority scientific challenges:  
- Accelerating the discovery of high-temperature superconductors by bridging electronic and mesoscopic scales.  
- Enabling real-time plasma dynamics modeling for fusion energy research.  
- Improving climate predictions by coupling atmospheric microphysics with global circulation patterns.  
By integrating machine learning with domain-specific physics, NeuroScale seeks to transform computational science into a tool for rapid, cross-disciplinary discovery.

### 2. Methodology  
**Research Design**  
NeuroScale combines neural operator architecture design, physics-informed learning, and Bayesian uncertainty quantification into a unified framework. The methodology is structured as follows:  

#### 2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
- **Data Sources**: High-fidelity simulation datasets from diverse domains:  
  - **Materials Science**: Molecular dynamics trajectories for superconductors (e.g., cuprates) from LAMMPS or Quantum Espresso.  
  - **Climate Modeling**: Multiscale atmospheric data (e.g., ERA5 reanalysis) with resolutions from 1km (cloud microphysics) to 100km (global circulation).  
  - **Fusion Energy**: Plasma turbulence simulations from gyrokinetic codes like GENE or XGC.  
- **Preprocessing**: Normalize data per scale, decompose into hierarchical representations (e.g., wavelet transforms), and split into training/validation/test sets (70%/15%/15%).  

#### 2.2 Neural Operator Architecture  
NeuroScale’s core is a **scale-adaptive neural operator** (SANO) that maps high-resolution inputs $u_h(x)$ to coarse-grained outputs $u_c(x)$ while preserving critical physics. The architecture includes:  
1. **Multi-Scale Encoder**: A wavelet-based encoder decomposes inputs into $S$ scales:  
   $$
   u_h(x) \rightarrow \{u^{(s)}(x)\}_{s=1}^S, \quad \text{where } u^{(s)}(x) = \mathcal{W}_s(u_h)(x),
   $$  
   with $\mathcal{W}_s$ denoting the wavelet transform at scale $s$.  
2. **Scale-Adaptive Attention**: A transformer-style mechanism computes attention weights between scales:  
   $$
   \alpha_{s,s'} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_s K_{s'}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right), \quad Q_s = W_Q u^{(s)}, \quad K_{s'} = W_K u^{(s')},
   $$  
   where $W_Q, W_K$ are learnable matrices. This allows the model to focus on inter-scale interactions critical to system dynamics.  
3. **Physics-Informed Decoder**: A decoder enforces conservation laws via a PDE residual loss:  
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}} = \frac{1}{|\Omega|} \int_\Omega \left( \frac{\partial u_c}{\partial t} + \mathcal{N}(u_c) \right)^2 dx,
   $$  
   where $\mathcal{N}$ is the PDE operator (e.g., Navier-Stokes).  

#### 2.3 Uncertainty-Aware Coarse-Graining  
To quantify uncertainty, we employ **Bayesian neural operators** with Monte Carlo dropout:  
- Each layer’s weights $W$ are sampled from a variational posterior $q_\theta(W)$ during training.  
- Predictive uncertainty is estimated via ensemble variance:  
  $$
  \sigma_c^2(x) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \left(u_c^{(m)}(x) - \bar{u}_c(x)\right)^2,
  $$  
  where $M$ dropout samples are drawn at inference.  

#### 2.4 Training and Optimization  
The total loss combines data fidelity, physics constraints, and uncertainty calibration:  
$$
\mathcal{L} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \|u_c^{(i)} - \hat{u}_c^{(i)}\|^2}_{\mathcal{L}_{\text{data}}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}} + \gamma \underbrace{\text{KL}(q_\theta(W) \| p(W))}_{\mathcal{L}_{\text{uncertainty}}},
$$  
where $\lambda, \gamma$ are tunable hyperparameters, and KL denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Training uses the Adam optimizer with gradient clipping.  

#### 2.5 Experimental Validation  
- **Baselines**: Compare against state-of-the-art neural operators (EquiNO, PIPNO, PPI-NO) and traditional multiscale methods (HMM, FE$^2$).  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Accuracy**: Mean squared error (MSE), relative $L^2$ error vs. ground truth simulations.  
  - **Efficiency**: Speedup factor (wall-clock time vs. conventional solvers).  
  - **Uncertainty**: Calibration error (difference between predicted confidence intervals and empirical coverage).  
- **Tasks**:  
  1. **Superconductor Critical Temperature Prediction**: Train on cuprate MD simulations, predict critical temperatures.  
  2. **Plasma Turbulence Modeling**: Forecast turbulent eddy dynamics in tokamak geometries.  
  3. **Climate Downscaling**: Reconstruct high-resolution precipitation fields from coarse climate model outputs.

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Algorithmic Performance**: NeuroScale is expected to achieve:  
   - **Accuracy**: ≤5% relative $L^2$ error across tasks, outperforming EquiNO (8–12% in arXiv:2504.07976).  
   - **Speed**: ≥1000x faster than traditional solvers, matching PIPNO’s efficiency (arXiv:2502.19543).  
   - **Uncertainty**: Calibration errors <2%, enabling reliable decision-making.  
2. **Generalizability**: Demonstrated cross-domain applicability via transfer learning from materials science to climate tasks.  
3. **Theoretical Insights**: New understanding of how attention mechanisms capture multiscale physics, validated via ablation studies.  

**Broader Impact**  
- **Scientific Discovery**: Accelerate materials design (e.g., room-temperature superconductors) and fusion energy development by replacing costly simulations.  
- **Climate Action**: Enable higher-resolution weather/climate predictions without exascale computing demands.  
- **Methodological Shift**: Establish a blueprint for integrating physical priors into machine learning, reducing data dependency and improving interpretability.  

**Risks and Mitigations**  
- **Over-regularization**: Physics constraints may limit model flexibility. Mitigation: Adopt adaptive weighting (Perez et al., 2023) to balance data and physics terms.  
- **Domain Shift**: Poor generalization across systems. Mitigation: Incorporate meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new domains.
