### Title: High-Dimensional Neural Network Dynamics: A Geometry-Based Approach

### Motivation:
The rapid growth of neural network sizes and complexities has led to an urgent need to understand their learning dynamics. Traditional low-dimensional geometry fails to capture the high-dimensional nature of modern neural networks, resulting in inaccurate and misleading insights. This research aims to bridge this gap by developing a geometry-based approach to analyze and explain high-dimensional neural network dynamics, thereby enhancing our understanding of model generalization, memorization, and forgetting.

### Main Idea:
This research proposes a novel methodology that leverages high-dimensional geometry to analyze and explain the learning dynamics of deep neural networks. The main idea is to use tools from high-dimensional geometry, such as manifold learning and intrinsic dimensionality, to interpret the optimization landscapes and data distributions of neural networks. By doing so, we aim to uncover the implicit regularization, inductive bias, and generalization properties that govern neural network learning at scale.

The methodology involves:
1. **Manifold Learning**: Applying manifold learning techniques to map the high-dimensional data and model parameters onto lower-dimensional manifolds, revealing the intrinsic structure and dynamics.
2. **Intrinsic Dimensionality**: Estimating the intrinsic dimensionality of the data and model parameters to understand the complexity and scaling limits of neural network dynamics.
3. **Loss Landscape Geometry**: Analyzing the geometry of the loss landscape to relate optimizer design, hyper-parameter choices, and neural network architectures to implicit regularization and generalization.

Expected outcomes include:
- A deeper understanding of the high-dimensional dynamics of neural network learning.
- Improved interpretability and explainability of neural network behavior.
- Novel insights into the design of neural network architectures and optimization algorithms.

Potential impact:
- Enhanced generalization capabilities of neural networks by better understanding and leveraging implicit regularization and inductive bias.
- Improved optimization algorithms and hyper-parameter choices for training deep neural networks.
- Advancements in the field of high-dimensional geometry and its applications to machine learning.
