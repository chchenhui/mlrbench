# Dynamic Modality Reliability Estimation for Trustworthy Multi-modal Medical Fusion  

## 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Multi-modal medical data fusion—integrating imaging (e.g., MRI, CT), electronic health records (EHRs), and genomics—is critical for comprehensive patient diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances in machine learning (ML), real-world clinical deployment faces trust gaps due to challenges like missing modalities, noise (e.g., imaging artifacts, EHR errors), and distribution shifts. Existing fusion methods often assume equal reliability across modalities, leading to overconfident predictions when modalities are corrupted. This diminishes clinical trust, as models cannot dynamically assess which modalities to prioritize under uncertainty. Addressing these limitations is vital to enable robust, transparent, and trustworthy medical AI systems.  

**Research Objectives**  
1. Develop a **dynamic modality reliability estimation framework** that quantifies uncertainty and adjusts modality contributions during inference.  
2. Integrate **self-supervised learning** to improve reliability assessment under synthetic and real-world corruption.  
3. Validate the framework’s robustness, uncertainty calibration, and interpretability across benchmarks with simulated and clinical data.  

**Significance**  
The proposed framework advances trustworthy ML in healthcare by:  
- Providing **uncertainty-aware predictions** that flag low-confidence cases, enabling clinician oversight.  
- Enhancing **interpretability** via attention maps highlighting trusted modalities.  
- Improving **generalization** by dynamically handling corrupted or biased data.  
This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-modal fusion and real-world clinical trust, accelerating ML adoption in healthcare.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Dynamic Modality Reliability Estimation  
**Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for Uncertainty Quantification**  
Each modality encoder utilizes Bayesian layers to model epistemic uncertainty. For modality $m$, the encoder outputs a Gaussian distribution over features:  
$$
p(\mathbf{h}_m | \mathbf{x}_m) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu}_m, \mathbf{\sigma}_m^2),
$$  
where $\mathbf{\mu}_m$ and $\mathbf{\sigma}_m^2$ are learned via variational inference. The reliability score $r_m$ for modality $m$ is derived from its uncertainty:  
$$
r_m = \frac{1}{\log(1 + \sigma_m^2) + \epsilon},
$$  
where $\epsilon$ prevents division by zero. Lower uncertainty (small $\sigma_m^2$) yields higher reliability.  

**Self-Supervised Modality Corruption Prediction**  
During training, synthetic corruptions (e.g., Gaussian noise, masking, or motion blur) are applied to modality $m$ with probability $p$. The model learns to predict the corruption type $c \in \{1, \dots, K\}$ from the corrupted features $\tilde{\mathbf{h}}_m$ via an auxiliary classifier:  
$$
L_{ssl} = -\sum_{c=1}^K \mathbb{I}(c = c^*)\log p(c | \tilde{\mathbf{h}}_m),
$$  
where $c^*$ is the true corruption label. This teaches the model to identify unreliable features.  

### 2.2 Reliability-Aware Multi-modal Fusion  
**Attention-Based Fusion**  
Modality-specific features $\mathbf{h}_m$ are fused using reliability-weighted attention:  
$$
\alpha_m = \frac{\exp(r_m)}{\sum_{m'=1}^M \exp(r_{m'})}, \quad \mathbf{h}_{\text{fused}} = \sum_{m=1}^M \alpha_m \mathbf{h}_m.
$$  
The attention weights $\alpha_m$ reflect dynamic reliability, downweighting noisy or missing modalities.  

**Joint Training**  
The total loss combines task-specific (e.g., classification) and self-supervised losses:  
$$
L = L_{\text{task}} + \lambda L_{ssl},
$$  
where $\lambda$ balances both objectives.  

### 2.3 Experimental Design  
**Datasets**  
- **MIMIC-IV & MIMIC-CXR**: Multi-modal EHRs and chest X-rays with simulated missing data and noise.  
- **TCGA**: Multi-omics and histopathology images with synthetic artifacts.  

**Corruption Simulation**  
- **Image Modalities**: Add Gaussian noise, motion blur, or random pixel masking (10%–50% corruption).  
- **EHRs**: Randomly mask 10%–30% of features or introduce label noise.  

**Baselines**  
Compare against state-of-the-art fusion models:  
- MDA (2024): Modal-Domain Attention for noisy/missing modalities.  
- DRIFA-Net (2024): Dual attention with Monte Carlo dropout.  
- DrFuse (2024): Disentangled representation learning for EHRs and images.  

**Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Task Performance**: Accuracy, AUC-ROC, F1-score.  
- **Uncertainty Calibration**: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier score.  
- **Robustness**: Performance degradation under increasing corruption levels.  
- **Interpretability**: Attention weight analysis and clinician assessments.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Robustness**: The framework will maintain high accuracy (>5% improvement over baselines) under 30% modality corruption.  
2. **Uncertainty-Aware Predictions**: Brier scores <0.1 and ECE <0.05, indicating well-calibrated uncertainties.  
3. **Interpretable Attention Maps**: Attention weights strongly correlated ($\rho > 0.8$) with clinician-annotated modality reliability.  

**Impact**  
This research will provide:  
- A **clinically trustworthy framework** for multi-modal fusion, reducing overconfidence in corrupted data.  
- **Open-source benchmarks** for reliability-aware fusion, fostering community-driven improvements.  
- **Guidelines** for dynamic reliability estimation in medical AI, addressing key challenges in fairness, privacy, and generalization.  

By enhancing transparency and robustness, this work will accelerate the adoption of ML in high-stakes clinical decision-making, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
