# Dynamic Modality Reliability Estimation and Adaptive Fusion for Trustworthy Multi-modal Healthcare Analytics

## 1. Introduction

Healthcare decision-making increasingly relies on multiple data modalities, including medical imaging (CT, MRI, ultrasound), electronic health records (EHRs), genomics, and pathology reports. Multi-modal machine learning (ML) models that integrate these diverse data sources have demonstrated superior performance compared to unimodal approaches across various healthcare applications, including disease diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and treatment planning. However, despite their promising technical advancements, the clinical adoption of these models remains limited, primarily due to concerns regarding their trustworthiness in real-world scenarios.

The major challenge for multi-modal medical fusion arises from the varying reliability of different modalities in practical settings. Current fusion approaches typically employ fixed fusion strategies or learn static weights during training, implicitly assuming that all modalities maintain consistent reliability during inference. This assumption is rarely valid in clinical environments where modalities can be corrupted by noise, artifacts, or domain shifts, and some modalities may be completely missing for certain patients. For instance, a patient's MRI scan may contain motion artifacts, or their EHR data might be incomplete. Naive fusion of such unreliable information can lead to overconfident yet incorrect predictions that potentially jeopardize patient care.

Furthermore, current multi-modal models often lack transparency regarding which modalities influence their decisions and to what extent, making it difficult for clinicians to interpret and trust model predictions. This black-box nature hinders the smooth integration of ML systems into clinical workflows, where stakeholders require clear justification for algorithmic recommendations.

This research proposes a novel approach to address these critical gaps: a Dynamic Modality Reliability Estimation and Adaptive Fusion (DMREAF) framework for multi-modal healthcare analytics. Our framework is built upon three key innovations:

1. **Dynamic reliability estimation**: We leverage Bayesian neural networks to estimate per-modality uncertainty during inference, capturing the real-time reliability of each data source.

2. **Adaptive modality fusion**: A reliability-aware attention mechanism dynamically weights the contribution of each modality based on estimated uncertainties, enhancing robustness against unreliable or missing modalities.

3. **Self-supervised reliability learning**: We introduce a novel auxiliary task that predicts synthetically injected modality corruptions, enabling the model to learn reliability assessment without requiring explicit supervision.

The significance of this research extends to several dimensions of trustworthy ML for healthcare. First, by dynamically adjusting reliance on each modality, our approach enhances robustness against data quality issues and domain shifts that are ubiquitous in clinical settings. Second, the uncertainty quantification provides clinicians with confidence estimates accompanying predictions, enabling appropriate skepticism where warranted. Third, the attention-based fusion mechanism generates interpretable visualizations highlighting which modalities influenced specific diagnoses. Finally, our approach maintains high performance even with missing modalities, enabling broader clinical applicability.

Through comprehensive evaluation across diverse medical datasets and simulated reliability challenges, this research aims to establish a new benchmark for trustworthy multi-modal fusion in healthcare, ultimately accelerating the responsible integration of ML into clinical practice.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

Let $\mathcal{X} = \{\mathbf{X}^1, \mathbf{X}^2, ..., \mathbf{X}^M\}$ denote a multi-modal input comprising $M$ modalities, where $\mathbf{X}^m$ represents the data from modality $m$. Each modality may have a different dimensionality and structure (e.g., images, sequences, tabular data). The learning objective is to predict a target variable $\mathbf{y}$ (e.g., diagnosis, prognosis) by leveraging information across all modalities.

In real-world clinical settings, each modality $\mathbf{X}^m$ may have varying degrees of reliability, which we define as a measure of the modality's information quality and relevance to the prediction task. This reliability is influenced by factors such as noise, artifacts, domain shifts, or data collection protocols. We denote the unknown true reliability of modality $m$ as $r^m \in [0,1]$, where higher values indicate greater reliability.

### 2.2 Dynamic Modality Reliability Estimation and Adaptive Fusion (DMREAF) Framework

Our proposed DMREAF framework consists of four main components:

1. Modality-specific encoders
2. Bayesian reliability estimators
3. Reliability-guided attention fusion
4. Self-supervised reliability learning

The overall architecture is illustrated in Figure 1 (note: figure would be included in an actual paper).

#### 2.2.1 Modality-specific Encoders

For each modality $m$, we employ a specialized encoder $f_{\theta_m}$ that extracts latent representations $\mathbf{h}^m = f_{\theta_m}(\mathbf{X}^m)$, where $\mathbf{h}^m \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $d$ is the dimension of the shared embedding space. These encoders are designed based on the specific characteristics of each modality:

- For imaging modalities (CT, MRI, etc.): Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Vision Transformers
- For sequence data (EHRs, time series): Recurrent Neural Networks or Transformer encoders
- For tabular data: Multilayer perceptrons with appropriate preprocessing

To handle missing modalities during training and inference, we implement a modality indicator vector $\mathbf{m} \in \{0,1\}^M$, where $m_i = 0$ if modality $i$ is missing. When a modality is missing, we replace its representation with a learnable embedding vector specific to that modality.

#### 2.2.2 Bayesian Reliability Estimators

To estimate the reliability of each modality dynamically during inference, we implement Bayesian reliability estimators. For each modality $m$, we employ Monte Carlo (MC) dropout to approximate Bayesian inference:

$$\hat{r}^m = g_{\phi_m}(\mathbf{h}^m)$$

where $g_{\phi_m}$ is a neural network with dropout layers that outputs an estimated reliability score $\hat{r}^m \in [0,1]$. During inference, we perform $T$ forward passes with dropout enabled to obtain a distribution of reliability estimates:

$$\{\hat{r}^m_t\}_{t=1}^T = \{g_{\phi_m}(\mathbf{h}^m, \mathbf{z}_t)\}_{t=1}^T$$

where $\mathbf{z}_t$ represents the random dropout mask at forward pass $t$. From this distribution, we compute two key metrics:

1. **Mean reliability**: The expected reliability of modality $m$
   $$\mu_r^m = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\hat{r}^m_t$$

2. **Reliability uncertainty**: The variance of the reliability estimates
   $$\sigma_r^m = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}(\hat{r}^m_t - \mu_r^m)^2$$

These metrics capture both the estimated reliability and the model's uncertainty about this estimation.

#### 2.2.3 Reliability-guided Attention Fusion

We propose a reliability-guided attention mechanism that dynamically weights the contribution of each modality based on the estimated reliability. First, we transform each modality representation $\mathbf{h}^m$ using a modality-specific projection:

$$\mathbf{z}^m = W_m\mathbf{h}^m + \mathbf{b}_m$$

Then, we compute attention weights $\alpha_m$ for each modality using the reliability estimates:

$$\alpha_m = \frac{\exp(\beta \cdot \mu_r^m)}{\sum_{j=1}^{M}\exp(\beta \cdot \mu_r^j)}$$

where $\beta$ is a temperature parameter that controls the sharpness of the attention distribution. The reliability-aware fused representation is then computed as:

$$\mathbf{h}_{\text{fused}} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \alpha_m \mathbf{z}^m$$

Additionally, we incorporate the uncertainty of reliability estimates by adjusting the prediction confidence. When aggregating the final prediction, we compute a global uncertainty measure:

$$\sigma_{\text{global}} = \sqrt{\sum_{m=1}^{M} \alpha_m^2 \cdot \sigma_r^m}$$

This global uncertainty is used to calibrate the model's confidence in its predictions.

#### 2.2.4 Self-supervised Reliability Learning

To train the reliability estimators without explicit reliability labels, we propose a self-supervised auxiliary task. During training, we randomly corrupt a subset of modalities and train the model to identify these corruptions. Specifically, we define a corruption function $c(\mathbf{X}^m, \delta)$ that applies a corruption with severity $\delta$ to modality $m$. Examples of corruption include:

- For images: Adding Gaussian noise, blurring, or masking regions
- For sequences: Replacing tokens with random values or dropping segments
- For tabular data: Randomly setting features to zero or adding noise

For each batch during training, we randomly select modalities to corrupt with probability $p_{\text{corrupt}}$ and apply corruptions with random severity $\delta \sim \mathcal{U}(0,1)$. The reliability estimator is then trained to predict both the presence and severity of corruptions:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{corrupt}} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \|\hat{r}^m - (1 - \delta_m)\|^2$$

where $\delta_m$ is the corruption severity for modality $m$ (or 0 if no corruption was applied).

### 2.3 Training Objective

The overall training objective consists of two components:

1. **Primary task loss**: For the main prediction task (e.g., classification, regression)
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} = \mathcal{L}(f_{\text{pred}}(\mathbf{h}_{\text{fused}}), \mathbf{y})$$

2. **Reliability estimation loss**: For the self-supervised corruption detection
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{corrupt}} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \|\hat{r}^m - (1 - \delta_m)\|^2$$

The combined loss is:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{corrupt}}$$

where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter balancing the two objectives.

### 2.4 Experimental Design and Validation

We will evaluate our DMREAF framework on multiple healthcare datasets featuring diverse modalities:

1. **BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation)**: Includes four MRI modalities (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR)
2. **MIMIC-CXR + MIMIC-IV**: Combining chest X-rays with structured EHR data
3. **ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)**: Includes MRI, PET scans, genomics, and cognitive tests

For each dataset, we will conduct the following experiments:

#### 2.4.1 Modality Corruption Experiments

We will systematically evaluate robustness to modality corruption by:
- Introducing varying levels of synthetic noise (Gaussian, impulse, motion artifacts)
- Simulating missing modalities at different rates (10%, 30%, 50%)
- Creating domain shifts through intensity transformations and scanner variations

#### 2.4.2 Comparison Methods

We will compare our approach against the following baselines:
- Unimodal models for each modality
- Standard multi-modal fusion approaches (concatenation, attention)
- State-of-the-art multi-modal models (MDA, DRIFA-Net, HEALNet, DrFuse)
- Variants of our model without dynamic reliability estimation and without self-supervised learning

#### 2.4.3 Evaluation Metrics

We will assess performance using the following metrics:

1. **Prediction accuracy metrics**:
   - Classification: Accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC
   - Regression: MAE, RMSE, R^2
   - Segmentation: Dice coefficient, IoU

2. **Reliability assessment metrics**:
   - Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
   - Proper Scoring Rules (Brier score, log loss)
   - Spearman correlation between predicted reliability and actual corruptions

3. **Robustness metrics**:
   - Performance degradation under corruption relative to clean data
   - AUC for detecting unreliable modalities

4. **Interpretability metrics**:
   - Human evaluation of attention maps by clinical experts
   - Consistency of reliability estimates with known corruption levels

#### 2.4.4 Ablation Studies

We will conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component:
- Impact of the number of Monte Carlo samples $T$
- Effect of different corruption types in self-supervised learning
- Influence of temperature parameter $\beta$ in attention mechanism
- Comparison of different Bayesian uncertainty methods (MC dropout vs. ensemble vs. variational inference)

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### 3.1 Expected Outcomes

This research is expected to yield the following outcomes:

1. **Enhanced robustness to unreliable modalities**: Our DMREAF framework is expected to maintain high performance even when some modalities are corrupted or missing, demonstrating less than 10% performance degradation when up to 30% of modalities are compromised, compared to 20-40% degradation in conventional fusion approaches.

2. **Improved uncertainty quantification**: The Bayesian reliability estimators will provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, with expected calibration errors reduced by at least 30% compared to deterministic fusion methods. This will enable clinicians to identify cases requiring additional scrutiny or data collection.

3. **Interpretable modality contribution**: The attention-based fusion mechanism will generate visual explanations highlighting which modalities contributed most to each prediction, aligning with clinical expertise as validated through expert evaluations.

4. **Generalizable reliability learning**: The self-supervised learning approach will demonstrate effectiveness across diverse medical datasets without requiring explicit reliability annotations, showing comparable performance to supervised approaches while being more practical for real-world deployment.

### 3.2 Clinical Impact

The clinical impact of this research extends beyond technical improvements, addressing key barriers to ML adoption in healthcare:

1. **Enhanced diagnostic confidence**: By providing reliability-weighted predictions with appropriate uncertainty estimates, our approach will help clinicians make more informed decisions, particularly in cases with ambiguous or conflicting information across modalities.

2. **Reduced false positives and negatives**: The ability to discount unreliable modalities dynamically will mitigate the risk of erroneous diagnoses based on corrupt data, potentially reducing unnecessary procedures and missed diagnoses.

3. **Broader applicability across clinical settings**: The robust handling of missing modalities makes our approach viable even in resource-constrained environments where all diagnostic tests may not be available, expanding the potential reach of ML-assisted healthcare.

4. **Improved clinical workflow integration**: The interpretable nature of our model will facilitate clinical acceptance by providing transparency into which data sources influenced specific predictions, aligning with clinicians' decision-making processes.

### 3.3 Technical Impact and Future Directions

From a technical perspective, this work contributes several advancements to the field of trustworthy ML for healthcare:

1. **Novel reliability estimation paradigm**: The proposed Bayesian reliability estimators offer a principled approach to quantifying modality quality dynamically during inference, applicable beyond healthcare to other multi-modal domains.

2. **Self-supervised reliability learning framework**: Our corruption-based self-supervised learning approach provides a scalable method for training reliability-aware models without requiring explicit reliability annotations, addressing a significant practical challenge.

3. **Integrated approach to multi-faceted trustworthiness**: Our framework simultaneously addresses multiple dimensions of trustworthiness (robustness, uncertainty quantification, interpretability), providing a holistic solution rather than tackling each dimension in isolation.

This research opens up several promising directions for future work:

1. **Causal reliability estimation**: Extending our framework to incorporate causal relationships between modalities and outcomes to better understand the mechanisms of reliability.

2. **Adaptive data acquisition**: Using reliability estimates to guide active data collection, suggesting which additional tests would most improve diagnostic confidence.

3. **Personalized reliability models**: Developing patient-specific reliability estimation that accounts for individual factors affecting data quality.

4. **Federated multi-modal learning**: Extending our approach to privacy-preserving federated learning scenarios where modalities may be distributed across institutions.

In conclusion, the proposed DMREAF framework addresses a critical gap in current multi-modal healthcare ML systems by dynamically assessing and adapting to varying modality reliability. By enhancing robustness, uncertainty awareness, and interpretability, this research takes an important step toward trustworthy ML that can be confidently deployed in clinical practice, ultimately improving patient care through more reliable and transparent decision support.
