# Dynamic Modality Reliability Estimation for Trustworthy Multi-modal Medical Fusion

## Introduction

The integration of multi-modal medical data, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, pathology, genetics, and electronic healthcare records (EHRs), has the potential to revolutionize healthcare diagnostics and treatment. However, real-world deployment of such systems faces significant challenges, particularly in terms of trustworthiness. Current multi-modal fusion methods often assume equal reliability across modalities, ignoring the presence of noise, missing data, or domain shifts. This can lead to overconfident, unreliable predictions, especially when some modalities are corrupted or biased.

To address these issues, this research aims to develop a dynamic modality reliability estimation framework for trustworthy multi-modal medical fusion. The proposed method will leverage Bayesian neural networks to quantify uncertainty per modality and integrate these estimates via attention mechanisms to weight modality contributions. Additionally, a self-supervised auxiliary task will be introduced to predict modality corruption, teaching the model to assess reliability. The proposed framework will be validated on benchmarks with simulated and real-world modality degradation scenarios.

### Research Objectives

1. **Dynamic Modality Reliability Estimation**: Develop a framework that dynamically estimates modality-specific reliability during inference.
2. **Uncertainty-Aware Predictions**: Integrate modality-specific uncertainty estimates to improve the reliability of predictions.
3. **Interpretable Attention Maps**: Provide interpretable attention maps highlighting trusted modalities.
4. **Benchmarking**: Establish benchmarks to quantify the trustworthiness of multi-modal fusion models in medical imaging tasks.

### Significance

The proposed research will contribute to the development of more robust and trustworthy multi-modal medical fusion models. By addressing modality-specific reliability and uncertainty, the framework will enhance the safety and transparency of clinical deployments. The resulting benchmarks will facilitate the evaluation and comparison of future multi-modal fusion methods, accelerating the adoption of machine learning in healthcare.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed framework consists of two main components: a dynamic modality reliability estimation module and a multi-modal fusion module. The dynamic modality reliability estimation module leverages Bayesian neural networks to quantify uncertainty per modality, while the multi-modal fusion module integrates these estimates via attention mechanisms to weight modality contributions. Additionally, a self-supervised auxiliary task will be introduced to predict modality corruption, teaching the model to assess reliability.

### Data Collection

The research will utilize publicly available medical datasets, including those from the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and TCGA repositories. These datasets will be used to simulate modality degradation scenarios, such as low-quality imaging, incomplete EHRs, and synthetic noise. The datasets will be preprocessed to ensure consistency and compatibility with the proposed framework.

### Algorithmic Steps

#### Dynamic Modality Reliability Estimation Module

1. **Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) Training**:
   - Train a BNN on each modality separately to quantify uncertainty.
   - Use variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution over model parameters.
   - $$ p(\theta | D) \propto p(D | \theta) p(\theta) $$
   - where \( D \) is the data, \( \theta \) are the model parameters, and \( p(\theta) \) is the prior distribution.

2. **Uncertainty Quantification**:
   - Compute the predictive uncertainty for each modality using the BNN.
   - $$ \sigma^2(\hat{y}) = \mathbb{E}_{q(\theta | D)} \left[ (\hat{y} - \hat{y}(\theta))^2 \right] $$
   - where \( \hat{y} \) is the predicted output and \( \hat{y}(\theta) \) is the predicted output given the model parameters \( \theta \).

#### Multi-Modal Fusion Module

1. **Attention Mechanism**:
   - Integrate modality-specific uncertainty estimates via attention mechanisms to weight modality contributions.
   - $$ \alpha_i = \frac{\exp(\beta_i)}{\sum_{j} \exp(\beta_j)} $$
   - where \( \alpha_i \) is the attention weight for modality \( i \), and \( \beta_i \) is the logit for modality \( i \).

2. **Self-Supervised Auxiliary Task**:
   - Introduce a self-supervised task to predict modality corruption.
   - Train the model to predict the presence or absence of noise, missing data, or domain shifts in each modality.
   - $$ \hat{y}_{\text{corruption}} = f_{\text{corruption}}(x) $$
   - where \( \hat{y}_{\text{corruption}} \) is the predicted corruption label, and \( f_{\text{corruption}} \) is the corruption prediction function.

### Experimental Design

The proposed framework will be evaluated on simulated and real-world modality degradation scenarios. The following evaluation metrics will be used:

1. **Accuracy**: Measure the accuracy of the predictions on the degraded datasets.
   - $$ \text{Accuracy} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbb{I}(\hat{y}_i = y_i) $$
   - where \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted label, \( y_i \) is the true label, and \( N \) is the number of samples.

2. **Uncertainty Calibration**: Evaluate the calibration of uncertainty estimates using the Expected Calibration Error (ECE).
   - $$ \text{ECE} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \left| \frac{1}{N_m} \sum_{i \in C_m} \mathbb{I}(\hat{y}_i = y_i) - \frac{1}{N_m} \sum_{i \in C_m} \hat{u}_i \right| $$
   - where \( M \) is the number of bins, \( N_m \) is the number of samples in bin \( m \), \( C_m \) is the set of samples in bin \( m \), \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted label, \( y_i \) is the true label, and \( \hat{u}_i \) is the predicted uncertainty.

3. **Interpretability**: Assess the interpretability of the attention maps by comparing them with domain expert annotations.

### Validation

The proposed framework will be validated on benchmarks with simulated and real-world modality degradation scenarios. The benchmarks will include datasets with low-quality imaging, incomplete EHRs, and synthetic noise. The performance of the framework will be compared with state-of-the-art multi-modal fusion methods to demonstrate its effectiveness in handling modality-specific reliability.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact
