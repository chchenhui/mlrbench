**Neural Geometry Preservation (NGP): A Unified Framework for Quantifying and Optimizing Geometric Structure in Biological and Artificial Neural Representations**

## 2. Introduction

**Background:**
A central goal in both neuroscience and machine learning is to understand how complex systems process information to build useful representations of the world. Recent findings highlight a remarkable convergence: biological neural circuits and artificial neural networks (ANNs) often preserve or systematically transform the geometric and topological structure of the data they represent (Workshop Task Description; Bronstein et al., 2023). In neuroscience, examples include the toroidal topology of head-direction cell activity in flies, the hexagonal lattice structure encoded by grid cells in the mammalian hippocampus for spatial navigation, and the low-dimensional manifolds capturing motor commands in the primate cortex (Workshop Task Description; Chaudhuri et al., 2019; Gardner et al., 2022). These findings suggest that encoding geometric relationships is a fundamental principle of biological computation, likely conferring advantages in efficiency and robustness.

Concurrently, the field of Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) has emerged, explicitly incorporating geometric priors—such as symmetries (equivariance/invariance), manifold structures, and topological properties—into ANN architectures (Bronstein et al., 2023; Cohen & Welling, 2016). Techniques leveraging group theory, graph neural networks, differential geometry, and topology have led to significant improvements in sample efficiency, generalization, and robustness across various domains including computer vision, molecular modeling, and physics simulations (Maggs et al., 2023; Pedersen et al., 2023; Monti et al., 2023). This parallel evolution strongly suggests that preserving geometric structure constitutes a substrate-agnostic principle for effective information processing.

However, despite this mounting evidence, a unified theoretical framework to rigorously quantify *how well* neural systems preserve geometric structure, *why* certain structures are preserved, and *what* trade-offs govern this preservation is currently lacking. Existing GDL approaches often impose specific geometric structures (e.g., equivariance to a known group), while analyses of biological data often qualitatively describe observed geometries. We lack systematic methods to measure the degree of geometric distortion across processing stages, understand the optimality of observed representations under computational or biological constraints, and compare geometric preservation strategies across diverse biological and artificial systems.

**Research Objectives:**
This research proposes to develop the **Neural Geometry Preservation (NGP)** framework, a comprehensive theoretical and computational toolkit designed to address this gap. The core objectives are:

1.  **Develop Rigorous Metrics for Geometric Distortion:** To formulate a suite of quantitative metrics that measure the degree and nature of geometric and topological distortion introduced by neural transformations, applicable to both biological neural data (spike trains, population activity) and artificial neural network activations. These metrics will capture various aspects of structure, including distances, angles, curvature, and topology.
2.  **Establish Theoretical Principles of Optimal Preservation:** To derive mathematical principles that explain why and how specific geometric structures are preserved or optimally distorted under various constraints (e.g., metabolic cost, network capacity, noise robustness, task performance). This involves formulating and analysing optimization problems that balance geometric fidelity with computational/biological resource limitations.
3.  **Conduct Cross-Domain Empirical Validation:** To apply the NGP framework to analyze and compare geometric preservation in carefully selected biological neural circuits (e.g., rodent hippocampal spatial representations, primate motor cortex) and diverse ANN architectures (e.g., CNNs, GNNs, Transformers, Equivariant Networks) trained on relevant tasks. This empirical validation will test the framework's utility and reveal potentially universal principles of neural representation.

**Significance:**
The NGP framework promises significant contributions to multiple fields, directly aligning with the themes of the NeurReps workshop.

*   **Unifying Principles:** By providing a common language and quantitative tools, NGP can bridge neuroscience and machine learning, facilitating the identification of substrate-agnostic principles of information processing grounded in geometry and symmetry, as envisioned by the workshop.
*   **Advancing Neuroscience:** It will offer neuroscientists quantitative methods to move beyond qualitative descriptions of representational geometry, enabling rigorous testing of hypotheses about how neural codes support behaviour and cognition, and potentially revealing why specific geometric structures (like grids or manifolds) emerge.
*   **Improving Artificial Intelligence:** The framework can guide the design of novel ANN architectures and training objectives that explicitly optimize for beneficial geometric properties, potentially leading to models with enhanced generalization, robustness to perturbations, interpretability, and sample efficiency, addressing key challenges in modern AI. Insights from optimal preservation strategies might inspire new forms of regularization or architectural priors beyond current GDL paradigms.
*   **Addressing Key Challenges:** This work directly tackles identified challenges (Literature Review: Key Challenges 1-5), such as developing distortion metrics, understanding optimality, ensuring cross-domain applicability, designing validation experiments, and informing network architecture design.

## 3. Methodology

The proposed research will proceed in three interconnected stages, corresponding to the core objectives: developing NGP metrics, deriving theoretical principles, and performing cross-domain validation.

**3.1. Stage 1: Development of NGP Metrics**

This stage focuses on creating a mathematically rigorous and computationally tractable suite of metrics to quantify geometric and topological distortion between an input space $X$ and a representation space $Z$ (neural activity or hidden layer activations), related by a transformation $f: X \rightarrow Z$. We assume $X$ and $Z$ are (potentially high-dimensional) spaces equipped with relevant geometric structure, often represented by point clouds or inferred manifolds.

*   **Data Representation:** We will consider input data $x \in X$ (e.g., sensory stimuli, task parameters) and their corresponding neural representations $z = f(x) \in Z$ (e.g., vectors of firing rates, hidden unit activations). We will primarily work with point cloud representations $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N \subset X$ and $\{z_i = f(x_i)\}_{i=1}^N \subset Z$. Intrinsic geometric structure will be estimated or assumed based on the domain (e.g., Euclidean distance for images, geodesic distances on known state manifolds, graph distances for discrete structures).

*   **Metric Suite:** We will develop metrics capturing different facets of geometric preservation:
    1.  **Metric Distortion:** Quantify how well pairwise distances are preserved.
        *   *Scale-Normalized Distance Correlation:* Measure the correlation between distances in $X$ and $Z$. Let $d_X$ and $d_Z$ be distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, geodesic). Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between $\{d_X(x_i, x_j)\}_{i<j}$ and $\{d_Z(z_i, z_j)\}_{i<j}$.
        *   *Metric Embedding Distortion (e.g., $\ell_p$-distortion):* For an embedding $f$, find the optimal scaling factor $c$ and measure the average or maximum distortion:
            $$ D_p(f) = \left( \frac{1}{N(N-1)/2} \sum_{i<j} \left| \frac{d_Z(z_i, z_j)}{d_X(x_i, x_j)} - c \right|^p \right)^{1/p} $$
            or $\max_{i \ne j} \max\left( \frac{d_Z(z_i, z_j)}{c \cdot d_X(x_i, x_j)}, \frac{c \cdot d_X(x_i, x_j)}{d_Z(z_i, z_j)} \right)$.
    2.  **Local Structure Preservation:** Assess how well local neighborhood relationships and tangent structures are maintained.
        *   *Neighborhood Overlap:* For each point $x_i$, compare its $k$-nearest neighbors in $X$ with the $k$-nearest neighbors of $z_i = f(x_i)$ in $Z$ using measures like Jaccard index. Average over all points.
        *   *Tangent Space Alignment (requires manifold assumption):* If manifolds can be locally approximated, compare the tangent spaces $T_{x_i}X$ and $T_{z_i}Z$ using techniques like canonical correlations or Procrustes analysis after dimensionality reduction (e.g., via PCA on local neighborhoods). (Inspired by Lu & Zhang, 2024).
    3.  **Topological Feature Preservation:** Quantify the preservation of topological invariants using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) (Pedersen et al., 2023).
        *   *Persistence Diagram Distance:* Construct Vietoris-Rips or Alpha complexes from point clouds $\{x_i\}$ and $\{z_i\}$. Compute their persistence diagrams $Dgm(X)$ and $Dgm(Z)$ for different homology dimensions (connected components, loops, voids). Measure the dissimilarity between diagrams using Wasserstein or Bottleneck distances: $W_p(Dgm(X), Dgm(Z))$.
    4.  **Symmetry/Equivariance Preservation:** Measure the deviation from perfect equivariance for transformations $g$ belonging to a group $G$. Let $\rho_X$ and $\rho_Z$ be the actions of $G$ on $X$ and $Z$. Measure the equivariance error:
        $$ E_G(f) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim P_X, g \sim P_G} [ d_Z(f(\rho_X(g)x), \rho_Z(g)f(x)) ] $$
        This connects directly to established GDL principles (Cohen & Welling, 2016; Ben-Hamu et al., 2023).

*   **Implementation:** These metrics will be implemented in Python using libraries like Scikit-learn, Ripser, Gudhi, Geomstats, and PyTorch/TensorFlow for integration with ANN analysis pipelines. Computational efficiency will be a key consideration, exploring approximations for large datasets (e.g., based on landmark points).

**3.2. Stage 2: Theoretical Analysis of Optimal Preservation**

This stage aims to understand the trade-offs governing geometric preservation by formulating and analyzing optimization problems.

*   **Problem Formulation:** We formalize the problem as finding a neural transformation $f$ (parameterized by $\theta$) that minimizes task-specific loss $L_{task}(f)$ while satisfying constraints on geometric distortion $D_k(f) \le \epsilon_k$ (where $D_k$ are NGP metrics from Stage 1) and computational/biological resources $C(f) \le C_{max}$ (e.g., number of parameters/neurons, metabolic energy, inference time). Alternatively, we can frame it as minimizing a weighted combination:
    $$ \min_\theta L_{task}(f_\theta) + \sum_k \lambda_k D_k(f_\theta) + \gamma C(f_\theta) $$
    where $\lambda_k, \gamma$ are trade-off parameters.

*   **Analytical Derivations:** For simplified scenarios (e.g., linear transformations, specific types of non-linearities, known input geometries, specific distortion metrics like quadratic distortion), we will seek analytical solutions or bounds for optimal transformations $f^*$. This may involve techniques from:
    *   *Information Geometry:* Relating metric distortion to the Fisher Information Metric.
    *   *Rate-Distortion Theory:* Adapting concepts to quantify the trade-off between information compression (related to $C(f)$) and geometric fidelity ($D_k(f)$).
    *   *Calculus of Variations / Optimal Control:* For dynamical systems models of neural processing.
    *   *Group Theory and Representation Theory:* Analyzing how symmetry constraints influence optimal solutions, connecting to equivariance.

*   **Hypothesis Generation:** This theoretical analysis will generate hypotheses about *which* geometric properties are most critical to preserve for specific tasks or under certain constraints. For example, topological preservation might be crucial for navigation tasks (grid cells), while local metric preservation might be key for fine motor control. We might hypothesize that biological systems have evolved to operate near Pareto optimal frontiers of these trade-offs. The role of dynamics in shaping these representations will also be considered.

**3.3. Stage 3: Cross-Domain Empirical Validation**

This stage involves applying the NGP metrics and theoretical insights to real-world biological data and diverse ANNs.

*   **System Selection:**
    *   *Biological Systems:*
        1.  *Rodent Hippocampus:* Analyze publicly available datasets (e.g., from Moser lab, Buzsaki lab) of place cells and grid cells during spatial navigation tasks. Input space $X$ is the 2D environment; representation space $Z$ is the neural activity manifold. Assess metric (Euclidean distances) and topological (toroidal/hexagonal structure) preservation. Relate NGP metrics to task performance (accuracy of location decoding) and stability of representations.
        2.  *Primate Motor Cortex (M1/PMd):* Utilize datasets (e.g., from Neural Latents Benchmark, Churchland lab) recorded during reaching tasks. Input space $X$ could be target location or intended kinematics; representation $Z$ is the low-dimensional manifold of population activity. Analyze preservation of local structure and trajectory geometry. Correlate NGP metrics with movement accuracy and speed.
    *   *Artificial Systems:*
        1.  *CNNs on Image Classification:* Train standard CNNs and equivariant CNNs (e.g., E(2)-Steerable CNNs) on datasets like Rotated MNIST or PatternNet where input geometry (rotation, translation symmetry) is explicit. $X$ is the image space with geometric transformations, $Z$ is the activation space of different layers. Measure equivariance preservation ($E_{SE(2)}(f)$) and metric distortion under transformations. Correlate NGP metrics with generalization to unseen transformations and robustness to noise.
        2.  *GNNs on Molecular Property Prediction:* Use GNNs (standard and geometry-aware, e.g., SchNet, EGNN inspired by ideas like Maggs et al. 2023) on datasets like QM9. $X$ is the 3D molecular structure space, $Z$ is the latent graph embedding. Analyze preservation of inter-atomic distances and rotational/translational equivariance ($E_{E(3)}(f)$). Compare NGP metrics with prediction accuracy and data efficiency.
        3.  *Recurrent Networks / Transformers in Control/Robotics:* Train RNNs/Transformers (e.g., in MuJoCo environments) for tasks involving state estimation or control. $X$ is the underlying state space manifold, $Z$ is the network's hidden state. Apply NGP metrics (local structure, topological features if applicable) to evaluate how well the network's internal model captures the geometry of the environment's state space, connecting to equivariant world models (Workshop Theme).

*   **Experimental Procedure:**
    1.  *Data Preparation:* Preprocess biological and artificial data to obtain comparable point cloud representations or time series data.
    2.  *Metric Application:* Compute the suite of NGP metrics (distance, local, topological, equivariance) across different processing stages (layers in ANNs, potentially different brain areas or time windows in biological data).
    3.  *Comparative Analysis:* Compare NGP scores across different systems (biological vs. artificial), architectures (standard vs. geometric), layers, and training conditions (e.g., dataset size, regularization).
    4.  *Correlation with Performance:* Correlate NGP metric scores with standard task performance measures (accuracy, generalization error, robustness, sample efficiency) to identify which geometric properties are predictive of success.
    5.  *Testing Theoretical Predictions:* Evaluate hypotheses generated in Stage 2 regarding optimal preservation strategies and trade-offs. For instance, vary computational constraints (network size) and observe the impact on NGP metrics and task performance.

*   **Evaluation Metrics for the Framework:** The success of the NGP framework itself will be evaluated based on:
    *   *Consistency:* Do NGP metrics provide consistent rankings of representations across related tasks or datasets?
    *   *Predictive Power:* Do NGP metrics correlate strongly with model performance and generalization capabilities?
    *   *Interpretability:* Do NGP metrics provide meaningful insights into the representational strategies employed by different systems?
    *   *Computational Feasibility:* Are the metrics computationally tractable for relevant data sizes?


## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact

**Expected Outcomes:**

1.  **A Validated Suite of NGP Metrics:** A publicly available software library implementing the proposed metrics for quantifying geometric and topological distortion in neural representations, validated for computational feasibility and interpretive value.
2.  **Theoretical Principles of Geometric Preservation:** Mathematical derivations and empirically supported principles outlining the trade-offs between geometric fidelity, task performance, and computational/biological constraints. This includes identifying conditions under which specific geometric properties (e.g., metric, topology, symmetry) are preferentially preserved.
3.  **Comparative Analysis of Biological and Artificial Systems:** Quantitative comparisons revealing similarities and differences in how biological circuits and ANNs preserve geometric structure. This could uncover universal strategies or highlight domain-specific adaptations. For example, we expect to quantify the degree to which grid cell representations optimally preserve local distance information under constraints, and compare this to ANNs trained on similar navigation tasks.
4.  **Guidelines for Designing Geometry-Aware AI:** Insights from the NGP framework will inform the design of new ANN architectures, training objectives, or regularization techniques that explicitly promote beneficial geometric properties, potentially surpassing current GDL approaches by adapting the *degree* and *type* of geometry preservation to the specific task and constraints.
5.  **Publications and Presentations:** Dissemination of findings through publications in leading machine learning (NeurIPS, ICML) and neuroscience (Nature Neuroscience, Neuron) journals, as well as presentations at relevant workshops like NeurReps.

**Impact:**

The NGP framework is poised to make a significant impact by providing a unifying lens through which to study neural representations.

*   **For the NeurReps Community:** This research directly addresses the workshop's central theme of finding unifying principles based on symmetry and geometry in neural representations. It provides the tools to move from observing parallels to quantitatively analyzing and comparing them, fostering deeper connections between GDL, neuroscience, and related mathematical fields.
*   **For Neuroscience:** It offers a quantitative refinement of 'representational geometry' analysis, enabling more rigorous testing of hypotheses about the functional role of specific geometric codes in the brain (e.g., why grid cells are hexagonal, why motor cortex activity forms specific manifolds). Understanding optimal preservation under biological constraints could shed light on evolutionary pressures shaping neural circuits.
*   **For Machine Learning:** NGP can lead to more principled approaches for building robust, generalizable, and efficient AI systems. By understanding *how much* and *what kind* of geometry to preserve, we can design architectures that are not necessarily strictly equivariant but optimally adapt their internal geometry for the task at hand. This could lead to breakthroughs in areas like robotics (equivariant world models), drug discovery (geometric analysis of molecular representations), and scientific simulation (learning physics-informed representations, cf. Kashefi & Mukerji, 2022).
*   **Addressing Challenges:** The project directly tackles key challenges noted in the literature review by: (1) developing novel distortion metrics, (2) providing a theoretical framework for optimality, (3) explicitly focusing on cross-domain applicability, (4) outlining a detailed validation plan, and (5) generating principles to guide the integration of geometric preservation into ANNs.

In conclusion, the Neural Geometry Preservation framework offers a novel and timely approach to understanding a fundamental aspect of computation in both biological and artificial intelligence. By developing quantitative tools and theoretical insights, this research promises to significantly advance our understanding of neural representations and contribute to the development of more capable and efficient intelligent systems, resonating strongly with the goals and themes of the NeurReps workshop.
