# Neural Geometry Preservation: A Framework for Understanding Human and Machine Cognition

## Introduction

### Background

The study of neural computation has traditionally focused on the functional properties of neurons and neural circuits. However, recent findings in sensory and motor neuroscience suggest that the brain employs a computational strategy that mirrors the geometric and topological structure of the systems it represents. This phenomenon is observed in various brain regions, such as the head direction circuit in the fly, the activities of grid cells, and the low-dimensional manifold structure in motor cortex. These findings indicate a deep, substrate-agnostic principle of information processing that preserves the geometric structure of data across stages of neural processing.

Independently, the field of deep learning has also converged on this principle, leading to the nascent sub-field of Geometric Deep Learning. This approach incorporates geometric priors into artificial neural networks to preserve the geometry of signals as they are passed through layers of the network. This method has demonstrated gains in computational efficiency, robustness, and generalization performance of these models.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a formal framework called "Neural Geometry Preservation" (NGP) that quantifies how well neural systems maintain the geometric structure of their inputs across processing stages. The framework will consist of three main components:

1. **Metrics to measure geometric distortion in neural representations**: Developing accurate and computationally efficient metrics to quantify the geometric distortion in neural representations is critical for evaluating the effectiveness of the preservation strategy.

2. **Mathematical proofs showing optimal preservation strategies for different computational constraints**: Deriving mathematical proofs for optimal strategies that preserve geometric structures under various computational constraints is essential for understanding the underlying principles of geometric preservation.

3. **Experimental tests across biological and artificial systems**: Conducting experiments to validate the framework across diverse neural systems, including biological circuits and artificial networks, will provide insights into the common principles that govern effective neural representations.

### Significance

The development of the NGP framework has significant implications for both neuroscience and machine learning. In neuroscience, it can deepen our understanding of biological neural coding by revealing why certain geometric structures are preserved over others. In machine learning, it can lead to the development of new neural network architectures with improved generalization, robustness, and sample efficiency. Moreover, the framework can serve as a bridge between neuroscience and machine learning, fostering interdisciplinary research and collaboration.
