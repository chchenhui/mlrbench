1. **Title**: Symmetry-Guided Neural Maps: Bridging Grid Cells and Equivariant Robotics via Fiber Bundles  

2. **Motivation**: Biological neural circuits, such as grid cells in the brainâ€™s entorhinal cortex, exploit geometric priors like hexagonal lattice symmetries to encode spatial navigation. However, artificial systems often struggle to retain such structured representations in dynamic environments. Current equivariant neural networks for robotics focus on rigid symmetries (e.g., SO(3) rotations) but lack mechanisms to learn latent geometric constraints from raw sensory inputs. This disconnect limits their ability to handle real-world tasks with sparse observations and shifting topologies. By merging insights from neuroscience and geometric deep learning, we aim to develop models that self-organize hierarchical representations of space-time with inherent symmetry-awareness, improving adaptability and interpretability in embodied AI.  

3. **Main Idea**: We propose a framework that integrates topological self-organization (inspired by grid cell dynamics) with fiber bundle architectures to learn equivariant representations of spatial environments. The core innovation is a hybrid system where:  
- **Self-organizing neural maps** (akin to grid cells) learn latent coordinate frames from unstructured sensorimotor data using gradient-based Hebbian rules.  
- **Fiber bundle layers** encode symmetries (e.g., translational or rotational invariances) by lifting local coordinate patches to global Lie group structures (e.g., E(2) for planar motion).  
- **Geometric consistency losses** ensure alignment between topological manifolds and group-equivariant transformations.  
Applications target robotic navigation in dynamic settings (e.g., drones in urban environments), with explicit tests on out-of-distribution generalization. Expected outcomes include interpretable, hierarchical maps that dynamically balance local accuracy and global symmetry constraints, bridging the gap between biological spatial coding and robust AI systems.
