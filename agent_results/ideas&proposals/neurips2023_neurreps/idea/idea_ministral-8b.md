### Title: "Equivariant Neural Networks for Robust Motor Control"

### Motivation:
Motor control is a complex task that requires the brain to process and integrate sensory information from various sources to generate appropriate motor commands. Recent findings suggest that neural circuits representing motor control often exhibit geometric structures, implying that symmetry and geometry play crucial roles in this process. However, current deep learning models for motor control often lack the ability to preserve these geometric properties, leading to suboptimal performance and robustness. This research aims to develop equivariant neural networks that can effectively capture and leverage these geometric structures to improve motor control tasks.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research focuses on developing equivariant neural networks specifically designed for motor control tasks. These networks will incorporate geometric priors, such as group theory and Lie groups, to ensure that the learned representations are invariant or equivariant under transformations. The methodology involves:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Utilizing geometric data representations, such as joint angles and velocities, to capture the inherent symmetry in motor control tasks.
2. **Network Architecture**: Designing neural network architectures that are equivariant to rotational and translational symmetries. This can be achieved by using group convolutional layers and invariant pooling operations.
3. **Training Strategy**: Implementing training strategies that maximize the preservation of geometric structures, such as using loss functions that penalize deviations from equivariant representations.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of these networks on benchmarks for motor control tasks, such as robot arm control and human motion imitation.

Expected outcomes include improved robustness and generalization in motor control tasks, as well as new insights into the geometric principles underlying neural representations of motor control. The potential impact includes advancements in robotics, prosthetics, and rehabilitation technologies, where robust and efficient motor control is crucial.
