# Neural Geometry Preservation: A Framework for Understanding Human and Machine Cognition

## Motivation
Current understanding of neural computation often fails to account for the structural preservation observed across biological and artificial neural networks. In both contexts, neural systems maintain geometric and topological properties of input data through layers of processing. This preservation is more than a coincidence; it appears to be a fundamental principle of efficient information processing. Despite growing evidence in both neuroscience and deep learning, we lack a unified theoretical framework that explains why and how this geometric preservation emerges across different substrates.

## Main Idea
I propose developing a formal framework called "Neural Geometry Preservation" (NGP) that quantifies how well neural systems maintain the geometric structure of their inputs across processing stages. The framework would consist of: (1) Metrics to measure geometric distortion in neural representations; (2) Mathematical proofs showing optimal preservation strategies for different computational constraints; and (3) Experimental tests across biological and artificial systems. By applying this framework to analyze both biological circuits (e.g., grid cells, head direction cells) and artificial networks, we can identify common principles that govern effective neural representations. This could lead to new neural network architectures with improved generalization, robustness, and sample efficiency, while also deepening our understanding of biological neural coding by revealing why certain geometric structures are preserved over others.
