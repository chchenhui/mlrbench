1. **Title**: Hierarchical Sparse Attention for Efficient and Scalable Long-Context Foundation Models  

2. **Motivation**:  
Current long-context foundation models (LCFMs) face severe scalability challenges due to quadratic memory and compute requirements of standard self-attention, limiting their practicality for million-length sequences. While sparsity and compression techniques exist, they often sacrifice critical dependencies in long-range interactions. Developing methods that preserve contextual integrity while minimizing computational overhead is essential for advancing real-world, information-dense applications like genomics or legal document analysis.  

3. **Main Idea**:  
We propose **Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HISA)**, a novel architecture that combines hierarchical token clustering with learnable sparsity patterns. In HISA, tokens are grouped into multi-granular clusters via a lightweight pre-processing step (e.g., PCA-based salience detection or unsupervised markup cues). A hierarchical attention mechanism then computes: (1) dense attention across clusters, (2) sparse attention within clusters, and (3) cross-layer relevance routing to prioritize high-impact token groups. Training uses dynamic loss scaling, where long-range co-dependencies receive higher gradients. During inference, a reinforcement learning controller adaptsively selects sparsity levels per input, balancing efficiency and accuracy. Expected outcomes include **40–60× speedup** over dense attention without compromising downstream task performance, enabling deployable LCFMs for cross-modal long-sequence tasks. This could redefine resource constraints in domains like multi-genome analysis and massive legal reasoning.
