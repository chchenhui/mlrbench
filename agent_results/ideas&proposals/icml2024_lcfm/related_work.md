1. **Title**: FastKV: KV Cache Compression for Fast Long-Context Processing with Token-Selective Propagation (arXiv:2502.01068)
   - **Authors**: Dongwon Jo, Jiwon Song, Yulhwa Kim, Jae-Joon Kim
   - **Summary**: FastKV introduces a KV cache compression method designed to enhance latency for long-context sequences. It employs Token-Selective Propagation (TSP) to retain full context information in initial layers and selectively propagates only a portion in deeper layers, even during the prefill stage. Additionally, it incorporates grouped-query attention (GQA)-aware KV cache compression to exploit GQA's advantages in memory and computational efficiency. Experimental results show significant improvements in time-to-first-token and throughput compared to previous methods, while maintaining accuracy on long-context benchmarks.

2. **Title**: DynamicKV: Task-Aware Adaptive KV Cache Compression for Long Context LLMs (arXiv:2412.14838)
   - **Authors**: Xiabin Zhou, Wenbin Wang, Minyan Zeng, Jiaxian Guo, Xuebo Liu, Li Shen, Min Zhang, Liang Ding
   - **Summary**: DynamicKV proposes a method that dynamically optimizes token retention by adjusting the number of tokens retained at each layer to adapt to specific tasks. It establishes global and per-layer maximum KV cache budgets, temporarily retaining the maximum budget for the current layer, and periodically updates the KV cache sizes of all preceding layers during inference. This approach retains only 1.7% of the KV cache size while achieving approximately 85% of the full KV cache performance on LongBench, and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in extreme compression scenarios.

3. **Title**: KV-Distill: Nearly Lossless Learnable Context Compression for LLMs (arXiv:2503.10337)
   - **Authors**: Vivek Chari, Guanghui Qin, Benjamin Van Durme
   - **Summary**: KV-Distill introduces a Transformer compression framework that distills long context KV caches into significantly shorter representations in a question-independent manner. It can be trained as a parameter-efficient adaptor for pretrained models, enabling the compression of arbitrary spans of a context while preserving model capabilities. The method applies a KL-type divergence to match generated outputs between compressed and uncompressed caches. KV-Distill outperforms other compression techniques in worst-case extractive tasks and approaches uncompressed performance in long-context question answering and summarization.
