**Title:** Structured Probabilistic Inference with Domain-Knowledge Graphs for Molecular Generation  

**Motivation:** Generative models for molecules often produce chemically invalid structures, requiring costly post-hoc validation. This limits their utility in drug discovery and materials science. Integrating domain-specific constraints (e.g., valence rules, stability) directly into generative frameworks could ensure validity while maintaining diversity.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a graph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) that incorporates domain knowledge as probabilistic Represent Represent molecular rules (e.g., allowed bond types, ring sizes) via differentiable graph-structured energy functions within the latent space. During training, enforce these constraints using a hybrid loss combining reconstruction error and constraint satisfaction probabilities, derived from domain-specific graphical models. The model will be evaluated on molecular datasets (e.g., ZINC) using validity rate, diversity, and property optimization metrics. Expected outcomes include higher validity rates (>95% vs. ~60% in baselines) and improved sample efficiency. This approach could streamline molecular design by reducing manual validation, accelerating discovery in pharmacology and catalysis.
