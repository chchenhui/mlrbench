**Title:** Physics-Constrained Variational Inference for Graph-Structured Dynamical Systems

**Motivation:** Understanding complex dynamical systems represented as graphs (e.g., molecular dynamics, epidemic spread, power grids) requires accurate inference of latent states or parameters. Standard probabilistic methods often ignore underlying physical laws or domain constraints, leading to physically implausible or inaccurate inferences, especially with sparse or noisy observations.

**Main Idea:** We propose incorporating known physical constraints (e.g., conservation laws, energy functions, differential equations governing node/edge dynamics) directly into the variational inference framework for graph-structured systems. This will be achieved by designing the variational posterior distribution or the evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective to penalize deviations from these constraints. Specifically, we can use graph neural networks to parameterize the variational distribution, adding a physics-based regularization term to the ELBO derived from domain knowledge. This approach is expected to yield more accurate, robust, and physically consistent inferences compared to constraint-agnostic methods, improving predictions and understanding in scientific applications.
