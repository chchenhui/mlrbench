1. Title  
Physics-Informed Graph Normalizing Flows for Molecular Conformation Generation  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Generating realistic three-dimensional (3D) conformations of small molecules is a critical step in drug discovery and materials design. Traditional methods, such as distance-geometry algorithms and molecular dynamics, can be computationally expensive or suffer from mode collapse and poor coverage of low-energy conformational states. Recent deep generative approaches—including variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models (e.g., GeoDiff), and flow-based models (e.g., ConfFlow)—have achieved promising results in sampling diverse conformations. However, these methods often ignore or only implicitly incorporate physics-based constraints (bond lengths, bond angles, torsional potentials), leading to invalid or high-energy structures that require post-hoc filtering. Moreover, handling invariances (rotational, translational) and scalability to larger molecules remains an open challenge.

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a structured generative framework—Physics-Informed Graph Normalizing Flows (PI-GNF)—that embeds explicit physical priors into a graph-based normalizing flow model for molecular conformation generation. The specific objectives are:  
• To design invertible graph-flow layers that respect roto-translational invariance and capture complex atomic interactions.  
• To incorporate a differentiable physics-based energy penalty (based on a lightweight force-field approximation) into the flow training objective.  
• To demonstrate that the resulting model can generate chemically valid, low-energy, and diverse conformations in a single forward pass at inference time.  
• To evaluate scalability on benchmark datasets (GEOM, ZINC, PDB) and compare against state-of-the-art baselines (ConfFlow, GeoDiff, MolGrow, GraphEBM).

Significance  
By unifying probabilistic generative modeling with domain knowledge from computational chemistry, PI-GNF will:  
1. Increase the chemical validity rate and reduce reliance on post-processing.  
2. Improve sampling speed—critical for high-throughput virtual screening.  
3. Offer interpretable latent spaces that capture both statistical variation and energy landscapes.  
4. Facilitate downstream tasks such as binding affinity prediction and property optimization by providing physically plausible conformers.  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
Datasets:  
– GEOM-drugs and GEOM-qm9: large-scale repositories of experimentally or computationally determined conformers.  
– ZINC250K: commercially relevant molecules with high structural diversity.  
– PDB small-molecule entries: to test generalizability to real bioactive ligands.  

Preprocessing Steps:  
1. Standardize atom types and bond orders; remove salts and disconnected fragments.  
2. Center each conformation at its center of mass and standardize orientation (optional) to facilitate training.  
3. Extract node features $h_i^0$ = one-hot atom type concatenated with atomic partial charge and hybridization state; edge features $e_{ij}$ = one-hot bond type plus Euclidean distance $d_{ij}$.  
4. Partition data into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%), ensuring no scaffold overlap across splits.

3.2 Model Architecture  
PI-GNF consists of $K$ invertible flow blocks, each composed of:  
• Graph Masked Affine Coupling Layer (GMACL)  
• Physics-guided Energy Correction Layer (PECL)  

3.2.1 Graph Masked Affine Coupling Layer  
Building on the change-of-variable formula, for a molecule with Cartesian coordinates $X\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times 3}$, the model defines an invertible mapping $f_\theta:X\mapsto Z$ such that  
$$p_X(X) = p_Z\bigl(f_\theta(X)\bigr)\,\biggl|\det\!\bigl(\tfrac{\partial f_\theta}{\partial X}\bigr)\biggr|,$$  
where $p_Z$ is a tractable base distribution (standard normal). GMACL implements coupling transforms on the coordinate matrix: partition nodes into “active” and “passive” sets (via a fixed bipartition or learned mask). On each block $k$, we compute:  
$$S^{(k)},\,T^{(k)} = \mathrm{GraphNet}_{\phi_k}\bigl(H^{(k-1)},\,E\bigr),$$  
where $H^{(k-1)}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times d}$ are node embeddings from the previous block, and $E$ is the adjacency with edge features. The update for active nodes $A$ is:  
$$X^{(k)}_{A} = X^{(k-1)}_{A}\odot \exp\bigl(S^{(k)}_{A}\bigr) + T^{(k)}_{A},$$  
while passive nodes remain unchanged. The log-Jacobian is computed efficiently as  
$$\log\bigl|\det(\partial X^{(k)}/\partial X^{(k-1)})\bigr| = \sum_{i\in A}\sum_{d=1}^3 S^{(k)}_{i,d}.$$  
Node embeddings $H^{(k)}$ are updated via a standard graph message-passing step using the new coordinates.

3.2.2 Physics-guided Energy Correction Layer  
To incorporate physical priors, after each flow block we compute a differentiable approximate energy $E_{\rm ff}(X^{(k)})$ using a simplified force-field (e.g., MMFF94-lite):  
$$E_{\rm ff}(X) = \sum_{(i,j)\in \mathcal{B}} k_b(r_{ij}-r_{ij}^0)^2 + \sum_{(i,j,k)\in \mathcal{A}} k_\theta(\theta_{ijk}-\theta_{ijk}^0)^2 + \sum_{\rm torsions} V_n\bigl(1+\cos(n\phi-\gamma)\bigr)\,. $$  
We then apply a small corrective transform to $X^{(k)}$ that nudges atom positions against the gradient of $E_{\rm ff}$:  
$$X^{(k)\prime} = X^{(k)} - \eta\,\nabla_{X^{(k)}} E_{\rm ff}(X^{(k)})\,, $$  
with step size $\eta$ chosen to ensure invertibility (via a bounded‐magnitude constraint). The Jacobian determinant of this layer is approximated or computed via Hutchinson’s trace estimator for efficiency.

3.3 Training Objective  
We jointly optimize the negative log-likelihood under the flow model and the expected physics penalty:  
$$\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi) = -\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M \log p_X\bigl(X^{(m)}\bigr) \;+\;\lambda\,\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M E_{\rm ff}\bigl(X^{(m)}\bigr)\,, $$  
where  
$$\log p_X(X^{(m)}) = \log p_Z\bigl(f_\theta(X^{(m)})\bigr) + \sum_{k=1}^K \log\bigl|\det(\partial X^{(k)}/\partial X^{(k-1)})\bigr|\,. $$  
Hyperparameter $\lambda$ balances statistical fidelity against physical plausibility. We anneal $\lambda$ from 0 to a target value over the first 50 epochs.

3.4 Inference  
At test time, we sample $Z\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)$ and run the inverse transforms through all flow blocks and correction layers to obtain conformers $X=f_\theta^{-1}(Z)$. No iterative denoising is required, yielding $O(K)$ complexity per sample.

3.5 Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics  
Baselines

– GraphEBM (energy-based model).  

Metrics  
1. Chemical validity rate: fraction of samples respecting valence and bond length thresholds.  
2. RMSD to ground-truth conformers: reporting mean and distribution of minimal RMSD.  
3. Energy distribution: average $E_{\rm ff}(X)$ compared to ground truth conformers.  
4. Diversity: pairwise RMSD across 100 samples per molecule.  
5. Sampling time: wall-clock time per conformer.  

Ablation Studies

• Batch size: 32 molecules (pad smaller graphs).  
• Training length: 200 epochs or until convergence on validation loss.  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Expected Outcomes  
1. Improved chemical validity: Anticipated > 98% valid conformers versus ~85–90% for unconstrained flows.  
2. Low-energy sampling: Generated conformers whose $E_{\rm ff}$ is within 1–2 kcal/mol of ground truth minima.  
3. Enhanced diversity: Wider RMSD coverage, enabling exploration of novel conformational spaces.  
4. Speedup: Single-pass inference that is 5–10× faster than diffusion-based methods for comparable quality.  
5. Interpretability: Latent dimensions aligning with collective motions and torsional angles.

Broader Impact  
PI-GNF bridges the gap between deep generative modeling and domain-specific physical knowledge. It will:  
• Accelerate early-stage drug discovery by providing high-quality conformers for docking and virtual screening.  
• Reduce computational costs in materials science when exploring candidate molecules.  
• Serve as a template for physics-informed flows in other structured domains (e.g., protein folding, polymer design).  
• Foster interdisciplinary collaboration between machine learning researchers and domain scientists through open-source code and detailed documentation.

In summary, this proposal outlines a novel, principled approach to generative modeling of molecular conformations that tightly integrates probabilistic inference with physical constraints. The anticipated advances in validity, energy accuracy, and sampling efficiency have the potential to transform workflows in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and beyond.
