Title: Physics-Informed Graph Normalizing Flows for Molecular Conformation Generation

Motivation:  
Generating valid and diverse molecular conformations is crucial for drug discovery and materials science. Traditional generative models often produce chemically invalid structures or ignore underlying physical constraints (e.g., bond lengths, energy minima), limiting their utility in real‐world molecular design tasks.

Main Idea:  
We propose a structured generative framework that embeds physical priors directly into a graph‐based normalizing flow. Each molecule is represented as a labeled graph (atoms as nodes, bonds as edges) whose latent space transformation respects rotational and translational invariances. During training, we jointly optimize (1) the likelihood of reconstructing known conformers via a series of invertible graph flow layers and (2) a physics‐based energy penalty computed by a lightweight force‐field approximation. This dual objective encourages the flow to learn both statistical correlations in the data and fundamental energy landscapes. At inference time, the model generates novel low‐energy conformers in a single forward pass, providing fast and physically plausible sampling.  

Expected outcomes include improved chemical validity rates, diversity of novel conformations, and accelerated sampling compared to baseline VAEs or GANs. This approach bridges domain knowledge and probabilistic generative modeling, enabling more reliable and interpretable molecular design.
