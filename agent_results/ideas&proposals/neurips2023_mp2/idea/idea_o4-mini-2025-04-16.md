Title: Stagewise Moral Curriculum Learning for AI Alignment

Motivation: Current alignment methods like RLHF lack a structured framework for moral development, often amplifying monolithic value sets and producing brittle ethical judgments. Drawing on developmental moral psychology offers a systematic path to more robust, pluralistic moral competence in AI.

Main Idea: We propose a three-phase training curriculum mirroring Kohlbergâ€™s stages of moral development.  
1. Pre-conventional Phase: Reinforce rule-following behaviors via reward-punishment scenarios, ensuring basic compliance.  
2. Conventional Phase: Teach social-norm adherence through diverse, crowd-sourced examples spanning cultures and demographics, embedding pluralistic values.  
3. Post-conventional Phase: Optimize for abstract principles (e.g., justice, autonomy) using constraint-based learning and logic-driven loss functions derived from moral philosophy.  

We will curate a labeled scenario bank in collaboration with moral psychologists, sequentially fine-tune the model, and benchmark moral reasoning on standardized dilemmas. Expected outcomes include enhanced generalization to unseen ethical challenges, greater transparency in value hierarchies, and a replicable pipeline for ethically robust AI.
