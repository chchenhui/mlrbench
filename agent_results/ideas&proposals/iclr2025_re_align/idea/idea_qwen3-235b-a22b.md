1. **Title**: Causal-Driven Benchmarking for Robust Representational Alignment Metrics  

2. **Motivation**: Current alignment metrics often rely on static, correlational comparisons, limiting their ability to capture how interventions (e.g., training dynamics, architectural changes) causally influence alignment. This gap hinders reproducibility and practical applications, such as designing AI systems that align with human cognition or improving cross-domain generalization. A framework that evaluates metrics through causal interventions could resolve ambiguities in metric selection and enhance their utility in real-world scenarios.  

3. **Main Idea**: We propose a systematic framework to benchmark alignment metrics by introducing controlled causal interventions in both artificial and simulated biological systems. First, we will perturb system components (e.g., training data distributions, loss functions, or neural connectivity patterns) and measure how these changes propagate to representations. Next, we will evaluate existing metrics (e.g., CCA, RSA, alignment tensors) to determine their sensitivity to these interventions. By mapping causal effects to metric outputs, we will identify which metrics best capture meaningful alignment shifts. Finally, we will release a benchmark suite with synthetic and real-world datasets, standardized interventions, and metric evaluations. Expected outcomes include guidelines for metric selection, improved metric design, and insights into causal mechanisms driving alignment. This work will advance reproducibility in alignment research and enable targeted interventions for aligning AI with biological systems or cross-modal domains.
