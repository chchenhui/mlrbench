**Prototypical Contrastive Alignment for Brain-DNN Representations: A Framework for Interpretable and Intervenable Representational Similarity**

### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Representational alignment—the degree to which artificial and biological intelligences encode similar features of the world—is a critical challenge in machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science. While deep neural networks (DNNs) increasingly approximate human performance on tasks like image recognition, their internal representations often diverge from biological systems in both structure and semantics (Mahner et al., 2024; Sucholutsky et al., 2023). Existing alignment metrics, such as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), quantify similarity post hoc but lack mechanisms to interpret or intervene on the alignment process (Doe & Smith, 2023; Schaeffer et al., 2024). Furthermore, current methods rarely incorporate semantically meaningful anchors, limiting their utility for guiding model training or understanding shared computational strategies (Muttenthaler et al., 2022; Green & Black, 2024).  

**Research Objectives**  
This study aims to:  
1. Develop a **prototypical contrastive alignment framework** that jointly clusters DNN and brain representations to define interpretable semantic prototypes.  
2. Introduce a **prototypical contrastive loss** that serves as both an alignment metric and an intervention mechanism to steer DNN training toward brain-like representations.  
3. Evaluate the framework’s impact on neural predictivity, task transfer, and behavioral alignment, addressing key challenges in cross-system representational alignment.  

**Significance**  
The proposed method bridges three critical gaps:  
- **Interpretability**: Prototypes act as semantic anchors, enabling human-understandable comparisons between DNN and brain representations.  
- **Intervention**: The contrastive loss allows direct optimization of alignment during training, addressing the lack of actionable methods to steer model learning (Key Challenge 5).  
- **Generalizability**: By focusing on shared prototypes rather than instance-level similarities, the framework is robust to domain shifts and representation types (Key Challenge 2).  

This work directly addresses the Re-Align workshop’s themes, including the development of robust alignment metrics, intervention strategies, and implications for shared computational strategies between biological and artificial systems.

### 3. **Methodology**  
**3.1 Data Collection**  
- **Stimulus Set**: A curated dataset of 10,000 images spanning diverse semantic categories (e.g., animals, tools) to elicit rich neural and DNN responses.  
- **Neural Data**: fMRI or EEG recordings from 50 human subjects exposed to the stimulus set. Preprocessing includes noise reduction, trial averaging, and voxel/timepoint selection.  
- **DNN Activations**: Extract activations from intermediate layers of pretrained vision models (e.g., ResNet-50, ViT) for the same stimuli.  

**3.2 Joint Prototype Discovery**  
**Step 1: Cross-System Clustering**  
- **Input**: Paired DNN activations $\mathbf{Z} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$ and neural responses $\mathbf{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times m}$ for $N$ stimuli.  
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply PCA to $\mathbf{Z}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ to obtain low-dimensional embeddings $\tilde{\mathbf{Z}}$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{B}}$.  
- **Joint Clustering**: Use a modified k-means algorithm to cluster the concatenated embeddings $[\tilde{\mathbf{Z}}; \tilde{\mathbf{B}}]$ into $K$ prototypes. The objective is:  
  $$
  \min_{\{\mathbf{p}_k\}} \sum_{i=1}^N \min_k \left( \alpha \|\tilde{\mathbf{z}}_i - \mathbf{p}_k\|^2 + (1-\alpha) \|\tilde{\mathbf{b}}_i - \mathbf{p}_k\|^2 \right),
  $$  
  where $\alpha$ balances DNN and brain contributions.  

**Step 2: Prototype Assignment**  
- Assign each stimulus $i$ to its nearest prototype $\mathbf{p}_k$ in the joint space.  

**3.3 Prototypical Contrastive Loss**  
During DNN fine-tuning, optimize:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{PCL}},
$$  
where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$ is the task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy), and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{PCL}}$ is the prototypical contrastive loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{PCL}} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \log \frac{\exp(\mathbf{z}_i \cdot \mathbf{p}_+ / \tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^K \exp(\mathbf{z}_i \cdot \mathbf{p}_k / \tau)}.
$$  
Here, $\mathbf{p}_+$ is the prototype assigned to stimulus $i$, $\tau$ is a temperature parameter, and $\lambda$ controls the alignment strength.  

**3.4 Experimental Design**  
**Baselines**: Compare against RSA, CKA, ReAlnet (Lu et al., 2024), and vanilla contrastive learning (PCL; Li et al., 2020).  
**Evaluation Metrics**:  
- **Neural Predictivity**: Linear regression accuracy of predicting neural responses from DNN activations.  
- **Task Transfer**: Few-shot classification accuracy on unseen datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100).  
- **Behavioral Alignment**: Spearman correlation between DNN feature importance (gradient-based) and human attention maps (eye-tracking data).  
- **Prototype Interpretability**: Semantic coherence of prototypes via human subject ratings.  

**3.5 Implementation Details**  
- **Models**: ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 pretrained on ImageNet.  
- **Training**: Adam optimizer, learning rate $10^{-4}$, $\lambda=0.5$, $\tau=0.1$, $K=100$ prototypes.  
- **Reproducibility**: Code and preprocessed data will be publicly released.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Neural Predictivity**: The prototypical contrastive loss will yield DNNs with higher neural predictivity (15–20% improvement over RSA/CKA baselines).  
2. **Enhanced Task Transfer**: Prototype-aligned models will show superior few-shot learning performance, as prototypes capture semantically generalizable features.  
3. **Interpretable Alignment**: Prototypes will align with human-annotated semantic categories (e.g., “animal faces,” “vehicles”), validated via user studies.  
4. **Behavioral Alignment**: Feature importance patterns in DNNs will correlate more strongly with human attention maps ($\rho > 0.6$ vs. $\rho < 0.4$ in baselines).  

**Impact**  
- **Theoretical**: The framework provides a unified approach to measure and intervene on representational alignment, addressing the workshop’s call for robust metrics and intervention strategies.  
- **Practical**: By enabling DNNs to learn brain-like representations, the method can improve human-AI collaboration in domains like medical imaging and human-computer interaction.  
- **Ethical**: Explicit control over alignment strength ($\lambda$) allows researchers to explore the implications of increasing or decreasing alignment, informing debates on AI safety and value alignment.  

This work bridges machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science, advancing the Re-Align workshop’s mission to foster interdisciplinary progress in understanding intelligent systems.
