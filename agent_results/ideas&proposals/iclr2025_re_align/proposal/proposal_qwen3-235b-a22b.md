# Prototypical Contrastive Alignment for Brain-DNN Representations

## 1. Introduction

### Background  
The alignment of representations between biological and artificial intelligence systems remains a central challenge in understanding and bridging human and machine cognition (Sucholutsky et al., 2023). While deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve human-level performance in tasks like vision and language, their internal representations often diverge from neurobiological mechanisms. Traditional methods for measuring representational similarity, such as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008), focus on post-hoc comparisons without actionable mechanisms to steer model training. Recent advances in prototypical contrastive learning (PCL) (Li et al., 2020) and joint clustering (Laura Blue et al., 2024) offer promising frameworks for creating interpretable anchors in representation spaces, though their application to brain-DNN alignment remains underexplored. Challenges include the lack of semantically meaningful reference points, limited generalizability across domains, and insufficient integration of cognitive semantics (Mahner et al., 2024; Green et al., 2024).

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to:  
1. Develop a two-stage framework for aligning DNN and neural representations using prototypical contrastive learning.  
2. Establish interpretable "semantic anchors" through joint clustering of brain and DNN latent spaces.  
3. Introduce a trainable prototypical contrastive loss that simultaneously quantifies alignment and modifies model behavior.  
4. Evaluate improvements in neural predictivity, behavioral alignment, and task transferability.  

### Significance  
This work directly addresses limitations in existing alignment metrics by combining semantic interpretability with intervention capabilities. By anchoring representations to human-derived prototypes (White & Brown, 2023; Green et al., 2024), our method could reveal shared computational principles across biological and artificial systems, while advancing the workshop's goal of creating reproducible, domain-generalizable alignment techniques.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Collection & Preprocessing  
**Paired Dataset Construction**:  
We will collect multimodal data where:  
- Each stimulus $x \in \mathbb{R}^D$ (e.g., images from ImageNet subsets) is presented to human subjects.  
- Brain responses $b \in \mathbb{R}^{T}$ (e.g., fMRI voxels or EEG channels) and DNN activations $z \in \mathbb{R}^{L}$ (layer-wise representations) are recorded synchronously.  
- Data will include publicly available datasets (e.g., BOLD5000 fMRI, Algonauts Project) and new experiments.  

**Normalization**:  
- DNN activations will be L2-normalized across layers:  
  $$ \hat{z} = \frac{z}{\|z\|_2} $$  
- Brain signals $b$ will undergo z-scoring and ROI-specific noise reduction (Lu et al., 2024).  

### 2.2 Joint Clustering for Prototypes  
**Stage 1: Prototype Discovery**  
We concatenate brain-DNN pairs $\{z_i, b_i\}$ and apply k-means clustering to learn $K$ prototypes $P = \{p_k \in \mathbb{R}^{L+T}\}_{k=1}^K$. Each prototype defines a compact semantic category (e.g., animate vs. inanimate).  

**Prototype Pruning**:  
Semantic relevance is validated through:  
- Human semantic similarity ratings on cluster samples.  
- Consistency with cognitive taxonomies (Mahner et al., 2024).  

### 2.3 Prototypical Contrastive Learning  
**Stage 2: Training with Prototype Regularization**  
Given a DNN layer output $z_i$ and its aligned brain prototype $k_i$ (from Stage 1), we define a prototypical contrastive loss:  

$$
\mathcal{L} = - \log \left( \frac{\exp(z_i \cdot p_{k_i}/\tau)}{\sum_{j=1}^K \exp(z_i \cdot p_j/\tau)} \right),
$$

where $\tau$ is a temperature hyperparameter controlling concentration. This maximizes cosine similarity (Equation 1) to the true prototype while minimizing similarity to others, creating a pull-push dynamic.  

**Network Modifications**:  
- A projection head $f_\theta$ maps DNN features $z$ to a normalized latent space.  
- Prototypes $p_k$ are fixed during training, acting as global anchors.  

### 2.4 Experimental Design  
**Baseline Comparisons**:  
- **RSA-based alignment** (Doe & Smith, 2023)  
- **ReAlnet** (single-modality alignment; Lu et al., 2024)  
- **CCA-based joint training** (Green et al., 2024)  

**Metrics**:  
1. **Neural Predictivity**: Correlation between model activations and held-out brain data (*r* metric).  
2. **Behavioral Alignment**: Similarity of model feature-attribution maps (via Grad-CAM) to human eye-tracking fixations (Mahner et al., 2024).  
3. **Transfer Learning Performance**: Accuracy drops after freezing layers on downstream tasks (e.g., ImageNet classification).  
4. **Robustness**: Performance on corrupted images (e.g., Gaussian noise) and domain shifts.  

**Statistical Validation**:  
- 10-fold cross-validation over stimulus sets.  
- Wilcoxon tests for significance (p < 0.05).

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Technical Outcomes  
1. **Interpretable Anchors**:  
   - Prototypes $p_k$ will capture cognitively meaningful dimensions (e.g., color, texture, animacy), validated via human annotation and taxonomic consistency (White & Brown, 2023; Green et al., 2024).  

2. **Alignment Improvements**:  
   - Hypothesis: $\mathcal{L}$ will increase cross-modal correlation by â‰¥15% over RSA baselines.  
   - Feature attribution maps are expected to align more closely with human fixations (e.g., $\Delta r \geq 0.2$ on saliency datasets).  

3. **Intervention Efficacy**:  
   - Training with $\mathcal{L}$ should enable controlled modulation of DNN "neural-likeness," with ablative experiments showing degradation when prototype constraints are removed.  

### Scientific Contributions  
1. **Bridging Modalities**:  
   The method will provide the first framework integrating DNN training objectives with neurocognitive prototypes, addressing limitations of single-modality alignment (Lu et al., 2024).  

2. **Generalizable Metrics**:  
   Prototype-based similarity distributions (e.g., $\{ \text{cos}(z, p_k) \}$) will offer a domain-agnostic alignment measure, advancing debates around reproducibility (Cloos et al., 2024).  

### Societal Impact  
1. **Neuroscience Applications**:  
   Clinicians could use prototypes to interpret brain responses in neurodisorder diagnosis or brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), building on Johnson & Lee (2023).  

2. **AI Safety**:  
   Explicit intervention in neural-likeness raises questions about value alignment (workshop theme) and potential risks of over-conforming to human biases.  

3. **Open Science**:  
   Released prototypes and benchmark code will facilitate reproducibility, directly supporting the Re-Align workshop's hackathon goals.
