# **Uncertainty-Aware Decoding for Mitigating Hallucinations in LLMs**

---

## **1. Introduction**

### **Background**
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, enabling advancements in domains ranging from healthcare to legal systems. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by a critical limitation: they often generate factually incorrect but semantically coherent outputs, known as *hallucinations*. These hallucinations occur because LLMs lack inherent mechanisms to quantify uncertainty in their predictions. For instance, a model might confidently assert a false medical treatment recommendation, posing risks in high-stakes applications. This gap in reliability underscores the urgent need for uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods that empower models to recognize and mitigate their own limitations in real time.

### **Research Objectives**
This proposal addresses the following objectives:  
1. **Develop** an Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD) framework that integrates uncertainty metrics into the LLM generation loop.  
2. **Evaluate** the effectiveness of UAD in reducing hallucinations during text generation.  
3. **Optimize** computational efficiency to ensure real-time applicability.  
4. **Establish dynamic thresholds** for uncertainty-based interventions to balance factual accuracy and creative generation.  
5. **Assess trade-offs** between uncertainty mitigation, generation quality, and computational cost.

### **Significance**
The proposed framework directly impacts the reliability of AI systems in critical domains:  
- **Clinical Decision-Making**: Reducing hallucinations in medical text generation ensures safer diagnoses.  
- **Legal Systems**: Enhanced factual consistency builds trust in automated legal document analysis.  
- **Autonomous Systems**: Reliable outputs are crucial for AI-guided robotics or autonomous vehicles.  
By proactively embedding UQ into decoding, this work advances the goal of "trustworthy AI," aligning with ethical and regulatory standards for AI deployment.

## **2. Methodology**

### **2.1 Data Collection**  
**Benchmarks**:  
- **TruthfulQA**: Measures adherence to factual correctness across 38 categories.  
- **REAL**: Real-toxicity prompts dataset for evaluating factual consistency.  
- **FActScore**: A factual consistency benchmark for summarization.  
- **MultiModalQA**: Multimodal reasoning tasks requiring alignment of text and images.  

**Fact-Checked Knowledge Base**:  
- **Wikidata and Pubmed**: Used for retrieving factual evidence during generation.  

**Baselines for Comparison**:  
- Greedy decoding, nucleus sampling (Top-p), beam search, and state-of-the-art methods like CALM (Shen et al., 2023).

### **2.2 Framework Architecture**  
UAD operates during autoregressive generation, inserting uncertainty checks at each decoding step. Its components include:  
1. **Uncertainty Estimators**: Measure token-level uncertainty.  
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adaptively adjust intervention points.  
3. **Intervention Module**: Modifies the sampling distribution (Fig. 1).

**Algorithm Overview**:  
```plaintext
Function UAD_DECODING(model, input_prompt):  
    for t = 1 to max_tokens:  
        logits = model(input_prompt)  
        p = softmax(logits)  
        u = compute_uncertainty(p)  // See Section 2.3  
        if u > threshold_t:  
            intervention = apply_intervention(p)  // Section 2.4  
            input_prompt += intervention  
        else:  
            input_prompt += sample_from(p)  
    return input_prompt  
```

### **2.3 Uncertainty Metrics**  
We deploy three complementary metrics to cover epistemic (model uncertainty) and aleatoric (data noise) uncertainty:  

#### **(1) Predictive Entropy (H)**  
$$ H(p) = -\sum_{i} p_i \log p_i $$  
High entropy indicates uncertainty about the next token.  

#### **(2) Monte Carlo Dropout Variance**  
Dropout is enabled during inference, and $M$ stochastic forward passes are computed:  
$$ \text{Var}(p) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^M (p_i^{(m)} - \mu)^2 \quad \text{where } \mu = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M p_i^{(m)} $$  
Variance across dropout samples approximates model confidence.  

#### **(3) Lightweight Ensemble Disagreement**  
An ensemble of $K$ small models (e.g., distillated versions of the base LLM) generates predictions. Disagreement is measured via Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD):  
$$ \text{JSD}(p_1, ..., p_K) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{i=1}^K D_{KL}(p_i \| M) \quad \text{where } M = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{i=1}^K p_i $$  
High JSD indicates uncertainty.  

### **2.4 Intervention Strategies**  
When uncertainty exceeds a time-varying threshold $\tau_t$, the model performs one of three actions:  

1. **Factual-Constrained Sampling**: Retrieve external evidence using a knowledge base API (e.g., Wikipedia) and restrict sampling to tokens aligned with the retrieved content:  
   $$ p'(v) \propto p(v) \cdot \mathbb{1}[v \in \text{evidence\_tokens}] $$  

2. **Re-Ranking**: Downweight high-uncertainty tokens using:  
   $$ p'(v) \propto p(v) \cdot \exp(-\lambda \cdot u(v)) $$  
   where $\lambda$ controls the trade-off between confidence and diversity.  

3. **Uncertainty Flag Injection**: Append a special token like [REVIEW], triggering a human-in-the-loop check.  

### **2.5 Experimental Design**  
#### **Setup**  
- **Models**: LLaMA-7B, Falcon-7B, and GPT-3.  
- **Ensemble**: 3 distillated models with 1/5th the parameters of the base LLM.  
- **Dropout**: 3 stochastic passes (M=3).  
- **Threshold Adaptation**: $\tau_t = \mu_{u_{1:t-1}} + \sigma_{u_{1:t-1}}$, dynamically updated per sequence.  

#### **Metrics**  
| **Category**       | **Metric**                          | **Description**                                                                 |  
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Hallucination**   | TruthScore (REAL)                   | Accuracy of statements against a gold-standard database.                       |  
| **Factual Consistency** | FActScore                    | Proportion of factual claims supported by retrieved evidence.                  |  
| **Generation Quality** | ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore          | Fluency, coherence, and relevance to input.                                    |  
| **Human Evaluation** | Truthfulness, Coherence, Creativity | Annotated by 10 experts on a 1-5 Likert scale.                                 |  
| **Efficiency**      | Tokens/Second                     | Computational overhead of UAD components.                                      |  

#### **Ablation Studies**  
- Sensitivity to:  
  a) Threshold selection ($\lambda$, $\tau_t$)  
  b) Ensemble size (K=1 vs. K=3)  
- Comparison of UAD variants (entropy-only vs. multi-metric).
