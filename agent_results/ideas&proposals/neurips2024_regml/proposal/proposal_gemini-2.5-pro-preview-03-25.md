## **1. Title: Causal Disentanglement for Regulatory Harmony: Unifying Fairness, Privacy, and Explainability in Machine Learning**

---

## **2. Introduction**

**Background:** Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly integrated into critical societal domains, including finance, healthcare, employment, and criminal justice. This ubiquity necessitates careful consideration of their ethical and legal implications. Recognizing potential harms such as discriminatory outcomes, privacy violations, and opaque decision-making, governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are enacting policies (e.g., EU AI Act, GDPR) to govern the development and deployment of algorithmic systems. These regulations mandate adherence to principles like fairness, privacy, robustness, and explainability.

However, a significant gap persists between the high-level principles outlined in regulatory frameworks and the practical implementation within ML systems (Workshop on Regulatable ML description). Current ML research often addresses these regulatory desiderata—fairness, privacy, explainability—in isolation. This siloed approach is problematic because these principles are frequently interdependent and can exhibit inherent tensions (Binkyte et al., 2025). For instance, techniques employed to enhance fairness might inadvertently compromise user privacy (e.g., requiring sensitive attribute data) or reduce model accuracy. Conversely, strong privacy-preserving mechanisms like Differential Privacy can sometimes obscure the factors driving model predictions, hindering explainability, or disproportionately affect minority subgroups, impacting fairness. Attempting to satisfy one regulatory requirement without considering others can lead to models that, while compliant on one axis, fail catastrophically on another, undermining trust and potentially violating legal or ethical standards.

**Problem Statement:** The core challenge lies in the lack of a unified, principled framework for jointly optimizing ML models for multiple, potentially conflicting regulatory requirements. Existing methods often resort to ad-hoc combinations or sequential adjustments, failing to capture the complex interplay between fairness, privacy, and explainability. This absence of a holistic approach makes it difficult to guarantee comprehensive regulatory compliance, assess the trade-offs systematically, and build truly trustworthy AI systems suitable for high-stakes applications. Translating multifaceted regulatory demands into concrete algorithmic constraints remains a highly non-trivial task.

**Proposed Solution:** This research proposes a novel framework grounded in **causal inference** to disentangle and harmonize the key regulatory desiderata of fairness, privacy, and explainability. We hypothesize that explicitly modeling the causal relationships between data features, sensitive attributes, model internals, predictions, and potential regulatory violations can provide a principled foundation for joint optimization. Our approach involves three core components:
1.  **Causal Graph Modeling:** Constructing causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that represent the data generating process and the model's decision-making pathways, explicitly identifying paths that lead to fairness violations (e.g., direct or indirect discrimination) or privacy leakage.
2.  **Multi-Objective Adversarial Training:** Developing a tailored adversarial training regime where distinct adversarial components challenge the main model to simultaneously satisfy fairness, privacy, and potentially explainability constraints, guided by the insights from the causal graph.
3.  **Regulatory Stress-Test Benchmark:** Creating a comprehensive benchmark suite, incorporating both synthetic datasets with known causal structures and challenging real-world datasets, to systematically evaluate the proposed framework, quantify trade-offs between desiderata under various conditions, and compare against baseline approaches.

**Research Objectives:**
*   **Objective 1:** To develop a methodology for constructing causal graphs that explicitly model the pathways relevant to fairness (discrimination), privacy (information leakage), and explainability (feature influence) in ML pipelines.
*   **Objective 2:** To design and implement a multi-objective adversarial training framework that leverages causal insights to jointly enforce fairness, privacy, and explainability constraints during model training.
*   **Objective 3:** To create a standardized "Regulatory Stress-Test" benchmark encompassing diverse datasets and evaluation metrics for rigorously assessing the performance and trade-offs of ML models under multi-faceted regulatory requirements.
*   **Objective 4:** To empirically evaluate the proposed causal disentanglement framework on the benchmark, quantifying its ability to harmonize fairness, privacy, and explainability, and comparing its performance against state-of-the-art methods that address these concerns individually or naively.
*   **Objective 5:** To analyze the identified trade-offs and synergies between different regulatory principles facilitated by the causal framework, providing insights into the root causes of conflicts.

**Significance:** This research directly addresses the critical gap between regulatory principles and ML practice highlighted by the Workshop on Regulatable ML. By leveraging causality (Binkyte et al., 2025; Ji et al., 2023), we aim to move beyond isolated solutions towards a more fundamental understanding of how different regulatory desiderata interact. The proposed framework offers a principled approach to building ML systems that are demonstrably fairer, more private, and more transparent simultaneously. Successful completion will provide: (i) A novel algorithmic framework for developing regulation-aware ML models; (ii) A rigorous benchmark for evaluating multi-objective compliance; (iii) Deeper insights into the inherent trade-offs and potential synergies between fairness, privacy, and explainability; and (iv) Practical tools and methodologies supporting the development and auditing of trustworthy AI systems in regulated domains like finance and healthcare.

## **3. Methodology**

Our methodology integrates causal modeling, multi-objective optimization, and rigorous empirical evaluation across three main phases.

**Phase 1: Causal Graph Discovery and Modeling for Regulatory Compliance**

This phase focuses on representing the interplay between data, model, and regulatory concepts using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) represented as DAGs $G = (V, E)$.

*   **Node Definition ($V$):** The nodes will represent key variables:
    *   $X$: Observed input features.
    *   $S$: Sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender). Note: $S$ might be part of $X$ or unobserved but correlated with proxies within $X$.
    *   $Z$: Unobserved confounding variables (if posited based on domain knowledge).
    *   $H$: Intermediate representations within the ML model $M_\theta$.
    *   $\hat{Y}$: Model prediction.
    *   $Y$: True outcome (if available).
    *   $L$: Variables indicating potential privacy leakage (e.g., reconstruction accuracy of $S$ or sensitive parts of $X$).
    *   $F$: Variables indicating fairness violations (e.g., disparity measures based on $S$ and $\hat{Y}$).
    *   $E$: Variables related to explainability (e.g., complexity of explanation, reliance on specific features).
*   **Edge Definition ($E$):** Edges represent direct causal relationships. The graph structure will capture assumptions about:
    *   Data Generation: How features $X$ and sensitive attributes $S$ influence each other and the true outcome $Y$.
    *   Model Processing: How $X$ influences $H$ and subsequently $\hat{Y}$.
    *   Regulatory Violation Pathways: How $S$ influences $\hat{Y}$ directly or indirectly (fairness paths, drawing inspiration from Grabowicz et al., 2022); how $H$ or $\hat{Y}$ might leak information about $S$ or $X$ (privacy paths); which paths from $X$ to $\hat{Y}$ are desirable for robust and interpretable predictions versus spurious correlations (explainability paths).
*   **Graph Construction:** We will employ a hybrid approach:
    1.  **Domain Knowledge:** Incorporate established knowledge from specific domains (e.g., known biases in financial lending, causal factors in disease diagnosis).
    2.  **Causal Discovery Algorithms:** Utilize algorithms (e.g., PC, FCI, GES, NOTEARS) on observational data, potentially incorporating constraints from domain knowledge, to infer plausible causal relationships. Special attention will be given to handling potential unobserved confounding.
    3.  **Model-Specific Structure:** Integrate the model architecture ($M_\theta$) itself into the graph to represent information flow.
*   **Formal Pathway Identification:** We will use causal concepts like Pearl's do-calculus and counterfactual reasoning to formally define regulation-relevant pathways. For example:
    *   *Direct Discrimination Path:* A direct edge $S \rightarrow \hat{Y}$ or $S \rightarrow H \rightarrow \hat{Y}$ where the path does not go through legitimate causal mediators.
    *   *Indirect Discrimination Path:* A path $S \rightarrow X_i \rightarrow \hat{Y}$ where $X_i$ is influenced by $S$ and illegitimately influences $\hat{Y}$.
    *   *Privacy Leakage Path:* A path allowing inference of $S$ (or sensitive $X_i$) from $H$ or $\hat{Y}$, potentially involving an adversary model.

**Phase 2: Causal-Guided Multi-Objective Adversarial Training**

Based on the insights from the causal graph, we will design a multi-objective optimization framework using adversarial training. The goal is to train a primary prediction model $M_\theta$ (parameterized by $\theta$) while simultaneously satisfying constraints related to fairness, privacy, and explainability.

*   **Architecture:** The framework consists of the primary model $M_\theta: X \rightarrow \hat{Y}$ and multiple adversarial networks (discriminators):
    *   **Fairness Adversary ($D_F$, parameterized by $\phi_F$):** Aims to predict the sensitive attribute $S$ from the model's internal representations $H$ or prediction $\hat{Y}$. $M_\theta$ is trained to minimize $D_F$'s predictive accuracy, thereby encouraging representations/predictions that are invariant to $S$ along undesired causal paths identified in Phase 1. This builds upon ideas like Lahoti et al. (2020) but is guided by the specific causal paths identified as problematic. The loss for $D_F$ ($L_{D_F}$) aims to maximize prediction accuracy, while the fairness component of $M_\theta$'s loss ($L_{adv\_F}$) aims to minimize it (maximize confusion).
    $$ \max_{\phi_F} L_{D_F}(\phi_F | \theta) \quad \text{and} \quad \min_{\theta} L_{adv\_F}(\theta | \phi_F) $$
    *   **Privacy Adversary ($D_P$, parameterized by $\phi_P$):** Aims to infer sensitive information (e.g., $S$ or reconstruct sensitive features in $X$) from $\hat{Y}$, $H$, or possibly model gradients (if applicable, e.g., in federated settings). $M_\theta$ is trained to minimize $D_P$'s success, guided by identified privacy leakage paths. This could involve minimizing mutual information or maximizing reconstruction error.
    $$ \max_{\phi_P} L_{D_P}(\phi_P | \theta) \quad \text{and} \quad \min_{\theta} L_{adv\_P}(\theta | \phi_P) $$
    *   **Explainability Regularizer/Constraint ($R_E$):** This component aims to encourage model behavior consistent with desirable causal pathways and discourage reliance on spurious correlations or overly complex decision boundaries. This might not be strictly adversarial. Options include:
        *   Regularizing model parameters based on feature importance relative to the causal graph (e.g., penalizing reliance on features deemed non-causal or spurious).
        *   Encouraging alignment between local explanations (e.g., SHAP values) and the structural equations implied by the causal graph.
        *   Promoting simpler decision boundaries in relevant subspaces.
        The goal is to minimize a penalty $R_E(\theta)$ that increases with undesirable model complexity or inconsistency with the causal model.

*   **Combined Objective Function:** The overall training objective for the primary model $M_\theta$ will be a weighted combination of the task-specific loss ($L_{task}$, e.g., cross-entropy for classification) and the penalties/losses derived from the adversaries and regularizers:
    $$ \min_{\theta} \left[ L_{task}(\theta) - \lambda_F L_{adv\_F}(\theta | \phi_F) - \lambda_P L_{adv\_P}(\theta | \phi_P) + \lambda_E R_E(\theta) \right] $$
    The adversaries $D_F$ and $D_P$ are trained concurrently to maximize their respective objectives. The hyperparameters $\lambda_F, \lambda_P, \lambda_E \ge 0$ control the trade-offs between task performance and the different regulatory objectives. Their values might be fixed, tuned via grid search, or potentially adapted dynamically during training (e.g., using Pareto optimization techniques).

*   **Training Dynamics:** The system will be trained using alternating optimization steps, updating the parameters $\theta$ of the main model and the parameters $\phi_F, \phi_P$ of the adversaries. Stability techniques common in GAN training might be necessary.

**Phase 3: Regulatory Stress-Test Benchmark and Evaluation**

This phase involves creating a robust evaluation suite and using it to assess the proposed framework.

*   **Dataset Selection:**
    *   **Synthetic Data:** Generate datasets with known ground-truth causal graphs of varying complexity, controlling the strength of bias, privacy risks, and feature correlations. This allows for precise evaluation of the framework's ability to recover known structures and enforce constraints correctly.
    *   **Real-World Data:** Utilize widely studied benchmark datasets associated with fairness, privacy, and explainability challenges, such as:
        *   *Fairness:* COMPAS (recidivism prediction), Adult Census (income prediction), German Credit (credit scoring).
        *   *Privacy/Healthcare:* MIMIC-III/eICU (medical predictions - requires careful handling of privacy), potentially using surrogate tasks if direct access is restricted.
        *   *Finance:* Datasets related to loan approval or fraud detection.
    The choice will prioritize datasets where plausible causal assumptions can be formulated.

*   **Evaluation Scenarios ("Stress Tests"):** We will evaluate models under various conditions:
    *   Varying levels of inherent bias or privacy risk in the training data.
    *   Different choices for the trade-off parameters ($\lambda_F, \lambda_P, \lambda_E$).
    *   Scenarios with missing sensitive attributes ($S$ needs to be inferred or handled via proxies, testing methods like ARL (Lahoti et al., 2020)).
    *   Robustness checks against distribution shifts between training and testing data.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:** A comprehensive set of metrics will be used:
    *   **Task Performance:** Accuracy, AUC-ROC, F1-Score, Log-Loss, domain-specific metrics.
    *   **Fairness:**
        *   *Group Fairness:* Demographic Parity Difference, Equalized Odds Difference, Equal Opportunity Difference.
        *   *Individual/Counterfactual Fairness:* Metrics assessing if changing $S$ would change $\hat{Y}$ for an individual, leveraging the causal model (potentially related to methods in Grabowicz et al., 2022). Measure consistency with path-specific effects from the causal graph.

    *   **Privacy:**
        *   *Membership Inference Attack Success Rate:* Adversary's ability to determine if a data point was in the training set.
        *   *Attribute Inference Attack Success Rate:* Adversary's ability to predict sensitive attributes $S$ from $\hat{Y}$ or $H$.
        *   *If DP mechanisms are integrated:* Report achieved $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy guarantee.
    *   **Explainability:**
        *   *Feature Importance Consistency:* Measure alignment of model feature importances (e.g., from SHAP) with causal graph pathways (e.g., correlating importance scores with expected causal strengths).
        *   *Explanation Stability:* Robustness of explanations to small input perturbations.
        *   *Model Complexity:* Measures like decision tree depth (if applicable) or parameter norms.
        *   *Counterfactual Explanation Plausibility:* Consistency of generated counterfactual explanations with the underlying causal model.

*   **Baselines:** We will compare our causally-guided multi-objective framework against:
    1.  Standard unconstrained ML models.
    2.  State-of-the-art methods addressing only fairness (e.g., adversarial debiasing, reweighting, post-processing).
    3.  State-of-the-art methods addressing only privacy (e.g., DP-SGD, PATE).
    4.  Methods attempting naive combinations of objectives (e.g., simple weighted sum of individual losses without causal guidance or adversarial components).
    5.  Existing methods that attempt joint optimization, if available.

*   **Implementation:** We plan to use standard ML libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), causal discovery libraries (e.g., DoWhy, CausalNex, gCastle), fairness toolkits (e.g., AIF360), and privacy libraries (e.g., Opacus). Code and benchmark results will be made publicly available.
