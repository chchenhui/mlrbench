**Title:** Multi-Objective Auditing Framework for Regulatory Compliance in Machine Learning  

**Motivation:** As ML models must comply with diverse regulations (e.g., GDPRâ€™s "right to explanation," fairness mandates), current auditing methods remain siloed, making compliance fragmented and inefficient. Organizations struggle to holistically evaluate models against overlapping or conflicting requirements, risking legal violations and public trust.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a unified auditing framework that integrates metrics for fairness, privacy, explainability, and robustness into a multi-objective optimization system. The framework will:  
1. Map regulatory guidelines to quantifiable metrics (e.g., demographic parity for fairness, gradient-based explainability scores).  
2. Use Pareto optimization to identify trade-offs between competing objectives (e.g., privacy vs. model accuracy).  
3. Automate compliance checks via modular tests, flagging violations and suggesting mitigations (e.g., differential privacy mechanisms).  
4. Validate through case studies in high-stakes domains (e.g., hiring, healthcare).  

**Expected Outcomes:** A toolkit for end-to-end regulatory auditing, benchmark datasets, and insights into balancing regulatory tensions.  
**Impact:** Streamlines compliance processes, reduces deployment risks, and bridges the gap between policy mandates and technical implementations.
