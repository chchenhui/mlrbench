**Title:** *Causal Disentanglement for Regulatory Harmony: Unifying Fairness, Privacy, and Explainability in ML*  

**Motivation:** Existing ML systems often address regulatory principles (e.g., fairness, privacy) in isolation, leading to unintended conflicts or trade-offsâ€”e.g., improving fairness might degrade privacy or model accuracy. Regulatory frameworks increasingly demand holistic compliance, yet technical methods struggle to harmonize these desiderata. This gap risks deploying systems that comply with one policy at the expense of others, creating vulnerabilities to bias, legal challenges, or ethical misuse.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a causal framework to disentangle the intertwined relationships between fairness, privacy, and explainability, enabling joint optimization. The method will: (1) Model **causal graphs** linking data features, model decisions, and regulation-violating pathways (e.g., identifying how sensitive attributes causally influence outputs); (2) Introduce **multi-objective adversarial training** to jointly enforce compliance, using separate discriminators for each regulation to ensure fair, private, and interpretable outputs; and (3) Create a **"regulatory stress-test" benchmark** with synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., healthcare, finance) to empirically measure trade-offs and identify root causes of conflict. Outcomes will provide novel insights into principled compliance and tools for auditing ML systems under multi-axis regulatory constraints. Impact includes enabling deployable models for high-risk domains requiring rigorous regulatory adherence.
