**Title:** Causal Disentanglement for Regulatory Harmony: Unifying Fairness, Privacy, and Explainability in ML  

---

**1. Introduction**  

**1.1 Background**  
The deployment of machine learning (ML) in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice has necessitated adherence to regulatory frameworks that emphasize fairness, privacy, and explainability. Governments worldwide, through policies like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the U.S. Algorithmic Accountability Act, mandate that ML systems avoid discriminatory practices, protect user privacy, and provide explanations for automated decisions. However, operationalizing these principles presents significant challenges. Existing technical approaches often optimize for individual objectives (e.g., fairness via demographic parity or privacy via differential privacy) in isolation, leading to inadvertent trade-offs. For instance, enforcing group fairness may require access to sensitive attributes, raising privacy risks, while explainability methods might inadvertently leak sensitive information.  

Recent work highlights the potential of causal reasoning to address such trade-offs. Binkyte et al. (2025) argue that causal methods are essential for unifying competing objectives in trustworthy ML. Similarly, Ji et al. (2023) demonstrate causality’s role in analyzing fairness-accuracy trade-offs. Yet, no framework exists to holistically model and optimize regulatory principles using causal mechanisms. This gap risks deploying models that comply with one policy while violating others.  

**1.2 Research Objectives**  
This research aims to develop a causal framework for harmonizing fairness, privacy, and explainability in ML systems. Specific objectives include:  
1. **Causal Modeling**: Construct causal graphs to identify regulatory violation pathways (e.g., how sensitive attributes causally impact model outcomes).  
2. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Design adversarial learning mechanisms to jointly enforce compliance across fairness, privacy, and explainability.  
3. **Benchmarking**: Create synthetic and real-world datasets to stress-test regulatory compliance under multi-axis constraints.  

**1.3 Significance**  
By addressing regulatory conflicts through causal reasoning, this work will enable ML systems to meet legal and ethical standards in critical domains. The outcomes will provide practitioners with tools to audit and refine models under complex regulatory requirements, advancing the operationalization of guidelines like the “right to explanation” (GDPR) and algorithmic fairness mandates.

**2. Methodology**  

**2.1 Causal Disentanglement via Structural Causal Models (SCMs)**  
To operationalize regulatory principles, we first model the causal relationships between input features, sensitive attributes, and model predictions using SCMs. Let $A$ denote sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender), $X$ represent non-sensitive features, and $Y$ be the model’s output. A structural causal model (SCM) defines each variable as a function of its parents and exogenous noise:  
$$
Y = f_Y(A, X, U_Y), \quad A = f_A(X, U_A),
$$  
where $U_Y$ and $U_A$ are exogenous variables.  

The average causal effect (ACE) of $A$ on $Y$ is computed using intervention (do-calculus):  
$$
\text{ACE}_{A \rightarrow Y} = \mathbb{E}[Y | do(A=1)] - \mathbb{E}[Y | do(A=0)].
$$  
A non-zero ACE indicates direct discrimination. To identify harmful pathways (e.g., $A \rightarrow Y$), we employ causal discovery algorithms (e.g., FCI for latent confounders) and mediation analysis.  

**2.2 Multi-Objective Adversarial Training**  
We propose a GAN-inspired architecture with three adversarial discriminators to enforce fairness, privacy, and explainability (Figure 1). Let $M_\theta$ denote the main model, and $D_\phi^F$, $D_\phi^P$, $D_\phi^E$ represent discriminators for fairness, privacy, and explainability.  

1. **Fairness**: Train $D_\phi^F$ to predict $A$ from $M_\theta(X)$, while $M_\theta$ aims to minimize $D_\phi^F$’s accuracy:  
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_F = \mathbb{E}[\log D_\phi^F(A | M_\theta(X))].
   $$  
2. **Privacy**: Train $D_\phi^P$ to infer $A$ from explanations (e.g., Shapley values), while $M_\theta$ minimizes leakage:  
   $$ 
   \mathcal{L}_P = \mathbb{E}[\log D_\phi^P(A | \text{Explain}(M_\theta, X))].
   $$  
3. **Explainability**: Train an auxiliary explainer $E_\psi$ to maximize fidelity with $M_\theta$’s decisions:  
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_E = \mathbb{E}[\|E_\psi(X) - M_\theta(X)\|^2].
   $$  

The combined loss for $M_\theta$ balances task performance (e.g., cross-entropy $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$) and regulatory objectives:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda_F \mathcal{L}_F + \lambda_P \mathcal{L}_P + \lambda_E \mathcal{L}_E,
$$  
where $\lambda_F, \lambda_P, \lambda_E$ are Lagrangian multipliers adaptively tuned via dual ascent.  

**2.3 Regulatory Stress-Test Benchmark**  
We develop a benchmark comprising:  
- **Synthetic Data**: Simulate SCMs with known causal pathways (e.g., $A \rightarrow X \rightarrow Y$ vs. $A \rightarrow Y$) to evaluate how well methods disentangle spurious correlations.  
- **Real-World Data**: Curate datasets from healthcare (e.g., Medical Expenditure Panel Survey), finance (e.g., German Credit), and criminal justice (e.g., COMPAS), annotated with sensitive attributes and domain-specific regulations.  

**2.4 Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against single-objective methods (e.g., adversarial debiasing, differential privacy) and multi-objective approaches (e.g., Pareto-front optimization).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Fairness**: Statistical parity difference ($\Delta_{SP}$), equal opportunity difference ($\Delta_{EO}$).  
  - **Privacy**: Mutual information $I(A; M_\theta(X))$, accuracy of membership inference attacks.  
  - **Explainability**: Feature attribution fidelity (AUROC between $E_\psi(X)$ and ground-truth Shapley values).  
  - **Utility**: Task accuracy, F1-score.  
- **Analysis**: Conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each regulatory component and use causal mediation analysis to quantify pathway suppression.
