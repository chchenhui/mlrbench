## **1. Title: Dynamic Sparse Retrieval-Augmented Sub-Quadratic Models for Efficient Long Context Adaptation**

## **2. Introduction**

### 2.1 Background
Foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. However, their effectiveness often hinges on processing extensive contextual information, leading to significant computational challenges. The standard Transformer architecture exhibits quadratic complexity ($O(N^2)$) with respect to input sequence length $N$, rendering inference on long contexts prohibitively expensive in terms of latency, memory (especially for the Key-Value cache), and energy consumption. This limitation hinders applications requiring real-time processing of long documents or continuous data streams, such as analyzing financial reports, summarizing extensive legal documents, or adapting to rapidly evolving news events.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) has emerged as a promising technique to enhance model factuality and incorporate up-to-date information without retraining. RAG systems retrieve relevant passages from external knowledge sources and prepend them to the input query. While effective, standard RAG exacerbates the long-context problem, as appending retrieved documents significantly increases the input sequence length $N$, further straining computational resources (Xu et al., 2023; Yue et al., 2024). Recent efforts have focused on making RAG more efficient, for example, through context pruning (Fang et al., 2025 - AttentionRAG) or optimizing retrieval for long contexts (Jiang et al., 2024 - LongRAG), but often still rely on processing potentially large retrieved contexts with standard attention mechanisms.

Simultaneously, research has explored sub-quadratic architectures (e.g., Linear Transformers, State Space Models) and efficient attention mechanisms (Hu et al., 2024 - GCA) to mitigate the quadratic bottleneck. Furthermore, managing the KV cache, which stores intermediate activations and grows linearly with context length, is crucial for efficient inference. Techniques like KV cache compression (Tang et al., 2024 - RazorAttention; Cai et al., 2024 - PyramidKV; Rehg, 2024 - KV-Compress; Wang et al., 2024 - SqueezeAttention) and shared attention mechanisms (Liao & Vargas, 2024) aim to reduce this memory footprint.

However, a critical gap remains in developing models that can *dynamically* and *efficiently* adapt to long, evolving contexts (like data streams) by intelligently selecting *only* the most salient information from both the immediate input and historical context, while operating within strict computational and memory budgets. Addressing this requires integrating sparse, context-aware retrieval with efficient sub-quadratic processing and bounded memory management.

### 2.2 Research Objectives
This research aims to develop and evaluate a novel foundation model architecture, **DySRA-SubQ (Dynamic Sparse Retrieval-Augmented Sub-Quadratic Model)**, designed for efficient and adaptive long-context processing. Our primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Dynamic Sparse Retriever:** Design and train a lightweight, query-aware retrieval module using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to selectively identify and fetch *minimal but sufficient* context tokens (from external corpora or historical input) relevant to the current query, minimizing redundant information processing.
2.  **Integrate Sparse Attention within a Sub-Quadratic Backbone:** Implement a sub-quadratic model architecture (e.g., based on linear attention or state-space principles) where the attention mechanism operates *only* on the original query tokens and the sparsely retrieved context tokens, reducing computational complexity significantly below $O(N^2)$.
3.  **Design a Rotating Compressive KV Cache:** Develop a KV cache management strategy that maintains a fixed memory footprint for historical context by compressing older key-value pairs into a compact representation (e.g., using low-rank projections) and rotating them out as new information arrives, enabling constant memory usage during streaming inference.
4.  **Co-optimize the System End-to-End:** Formulate and implement a hybrid loss function that jointly optimizes the retriever, the sub-quadratic backbone, and potentially the compression mechanism, balancing task performance (e.g., accuracy, perplexity) with retrieval sparsity and computational efficiency.
5.  **Evaluate Extensively:** Empirically validate the DySRA-SubQ model on benchmark long-context tasks and simulated streaming scenarios, comparing its performance, latency, throughput, and memory usage against relevant baselines, including standard Transformers, conventional RAG models, and state-of-the-art efficient attention/KV cache methods.

### 2.3 Significance
This research directly addresses the critical challenges highlighted in the Workshop on Scalable Optimization for Efficient and Adaptive Foundation Models. By focusing on **efficient long context understanding**, **sub-quadratic models**, **task-specific adaptation** (via dynamic retrieval), **retrieval augmentation for efficient processing**, and **optimization for latency and throughput**, our work aligns perfectly with the workshop's core themes.

The proposed DySRA-SubQ model offers several potential advancements:

*   **Scalable Adaptation:** Enables foundation models to continuously adapt to new information streams (e.g., news feeds, chat histories) with bounded computational and memory growth.
*   **Inference Efficiency:** Drastically reduces latency and memory requirements for long-context tasks compared to standard Transformers and conventional RAG approaches, potentially enabling deployment on resource-constrained platforms.
*   **Improved Throughput:** Higher efficiency translates directly to increased throughput for inference services handling long-context queries.
*   **Selective Context Utilization:** Moves beyond simple context truncation or naive retrieval-appending by actively selecting the most pertinent information, potentially leading to more focused and accurate generation.

Successfully achieving our objectives would represent a significant step towards building foundation models that can effectively handle the ever-increasing scale and dynamism of real-world data while remaining computationally tractable, paving the way for new applications in real-time analysis, personalized assistants, and continuous learning systems.

## **3. Methodology**

### 3.1 Overall Architecture
The proposed DySRA-SubQ model integrates three core components: (1) a Dynamic Sparse Retriever, (2) a Sub-Quadratic Backbone Model with Sparse Attention, and (3) a Rotating Compressive KV Cache.

Given an input query $Q$ and access to a potentially large external context corpus $C$ (which could also include historical interaction context), the process unfolds as follows:
1.  The Dynamic Sparse Retriever takes $Q$ as input and outputs a small set of relevant token indices $I_{retrieved} \subset \{1, ..., |C|\}$.
2.  The corresponding context tokens $C_{retrieved} = \{c_i | i \in I_{retrieved}\}$ are fetched.
3.  The input to the sub-quadratic backbone is formed by concatenating the query and the retrieved context: $X = [Q; C_{retrieved}]$.
4.  The backbone model processes $X$. Its attention layers are designed to operate sparsely, primarily focusing computation on interactions involving $C_{retrieved}$ and $Q$.
5.  During processing, the model utilizes the Rotating Compressive KV Cache to manage context from previous steps or very long inputs efficiently.
6.  The model generates an output $Y$ (e.g., an answer, a summary).

The entire system is trained end-to-end or via alternating optimization strategies.

### 3.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing
We will utilize standard benchmark datasets requiring long-context understanding and potentially simulate streaming scenarios. Examples include:
*   **Long-Context QA:** Natural Questions (NQ) with full Wikipedia pages (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019). We will adapt these datasets to fit our retrieval setting, where the model retrieves from the provided documents/corpus.
*   **Summarization:** arXiv dataset (Cohan et al., 2018), GovReport (Huang et al., 2021).
*   **Streaming Data Simulation:** Chronologically ordered news corpora (e.g., WMT News Crawl, RealNews) to simulate adaptation tasks where the model must process current articles based on recent history stored compressively.

Preprocessing will involve standard tokenization suitable for the chosen backbone model and structuring the data into (query, context corpus, target output) tuples. For streaming simulation, data will be segmented into time steps.

### 3.3 Dynamic Sparse Retriever
*   **Mechanism:** We propose using a lightweight model, potentially a small Transformer encoder or a BiLSTM, as the retriever. Given the query $Q$, it learns to predict which tokens or small chunks from the context corpus $C$ are most relevant.
*   **Training via Reinforcement Learning (RL):** The retrieval process can be framed as a sequential decision-making problem where the agent decides which tokens/chunks to fetch.
    *   **State ($s_t$):** Representation of the query $Q$ and potentially a summary of context retrieved so far.
    *   **Action ($a_t$):** Select a token index or chunk index from $C$ to retrieve, or decide to stop retrieving.
    *   **Policy ($\pi(a_t|s_t; \theta_{retriever})$):** The retriever model parameterized by $\theta_{retriever}$.
    *   **Reward ($R_t$):** A composite reward function designed to encourage both relevance and sparsity. A terminal reward $R_T$ based on the downstream task performance (e.g., accuracy F1 score of the final generated output $Y$) will be the primary signal. Intermediate rewards or penalties can be used to encourage sparsity:
        $$ R_t = - \gamma_{sparsity} \cdot |a_t| \quad \text{for non-terminal steps} $$
        $$ R_T = \text{TaskPerformance}(Y) - \gamma_{sparsity} \cdot \sum |a_t| $$
        where $|a_t|$ represents the number of tokens fetched at step $t$, and $\gamma_{sparsity}$ is a hyperparameter controlling the trade-off.
    *   **Objective:** Maximize the expected cumulative discounted reward using policy gradient methods like REINFORCE or PPO:
        $$ J(\theta_{retriever}) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi(\theta_{retriever})} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t R_t \right] $$
        where $\tau$ is a trajectory of states, actions, and rewards.

This RL approach allows the retriever to learn complex selection strategies sensitive to the query and the cost of retrieval, distinguishing it from methods that prune based solely on attention scores post-retrieval (like AttentionRAG).

### 3.4 Sub-Quadratic Backbone with Sparse Attention
*   **Backbone Choice:** We will explore state-of-the-art sub-quadratic architectures. Potential candidates include models based on:
    *   **Linear Attention:** (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) Approximates softmax attention, reducing complexity to $O(N)$.
    *   **State Space Models (SSMs):** (Gu et al., 2021 - S4; Gu & Dao, 2023 - Mamba) Achieve linear or near-linear scaling ($O(N \log N)$ or $O(N)$) while effectively modeling long-range dependencies.
*   **Sparse Attention Integration:** Regardless of the backbone, the core idea is to modify its attention mechanism (if applicable, or the way context is integrated) to focus only on the sparsely retrieved tokens $C_{retrieved}$. If using an attention-based sub-quadratic model, the standard attention computation:
    $$ \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V $$
    where $Q, K, V$ are derived from the full input sequence $X$ of length $N$, leading to $O(N^2)$ or approximated complexity.
    In our DySRA-SubQ model, the keys ($K'$) and values ($V'$) would be constructed *only* from the query tokens $Q$ and the retrieved context tokens $C_{retrieved}$. Let the length of $Q$ be $N_q$ and the number of retrieved tokens be $k = |C_{retrieved}|$. The effective sequence length for attention becomes $N' = N_q + k$. Since $k$ is actively minimized by the retriever and $k \ll |C|$, the complexity is significantly reduced. For a standard attention mechanism applied sparsely, complexity becomes $O((N_q+k)^2)$. If integrated into a linear attention backbone, complexity could approach $O(N_q + k)$. The exact formulation will depend on the chosen backbone, but the principle is restricting interactions to the curated sparse set $[Q; C_{retrieved}]$.

### 3.5 Rotating Compressive KV Cache
*   **Goal:** Maintain constant memory usage for the KV cache even with infinitely streaming context or extremely long inputs.
*   **Mechanism:** We propose a fixed-size KV cache buffer. Let the buffer size be $M$ tokens.
    1.  New key-value pairs $(k_i, v_i)$ generated during forward passes are added to the buffer.
    2.  When the buffer exceeds its capacity $M$, the oldest $\Delta$ key-value pairs, $(k_{old}, v_{old})$, are selected for compression.
    3.  These pairs are compressed into a smaller, fixed-size latent representation $(k_{comp}, v_{comp})$ using a technique like low-rank projection or a learned autoencoder. For instance, using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the matrix formed by stacking $k_{old}$ vectors (and similarly for $v_{old}$) and retaining the top $r$ singular values/vectors:
        $$ K_{old} = [k_{old,1}, ..., k_{old,\Delta}] \approx U_r \Sigma_r V_r^T $$
        The compressed representation could be $U_r \Sigma_r^{1/2}$ or another derived form. A learned projection $Proj_{\theta}$ could map $K_{old}$ to $K_{comp}$ directly.
    4.  This compressed representation $(k_{comp}, v_{comp})$ is stored in a separate, small "summary" buffer or potentially integrated back into the main buffer by replacing the raw pairs it summarizes.
    5.  The oldest raw pairs $(k_{old}, v_{old})$ are discarded.
*   **Attention with Compressed Cache:** When computing attention, the model attends to keys/values in the main buffer *and* the compressed summary representations. This allows access to historical information without unbounded memory growth. This differs from methods like RazorAttention or PyramidKV which prune/compress within a single forward pass context, while ours explicitly manages a potentially infinite history stream with constant memory.

### 3.6 End-to-End Co-Optimization
*   **Hybrid Loss:** To train the system effectively, we will use a hybrid loss function defined on the final output $Y$:
    $$ L_{total} = L_{task}(Y, Y_{target}) + \lambda_{retrieval} R_{retrieval} + \lambda_{compute} R_{compute} $$
    where:
    *   $L_{task}$ is the standard task loss (e.g., cross-entropy for generation/classification, F1 for QA).
    *   $R_{retrieval}$ is a regularization term penalizing the number of retrieved tokens, encouraging sparsity. $R_{retrieval} = |I_{retrieved}| = k$. This term is directly related to the RL reward structure for the retriever.
    *   $R_{compute}$ is a proxy for computational cost, potentially related to the effective sequence length squared $(N_q + k)^2$ or FLOPs count if measurable during training.
    *   $\lambda_{retrieval}$ and $\lambda_{compute}$ are hyperparameters balancing task performance and efficiency.
*   **Training Strategy:** We will explore two main strategies:
    1.  **Joint End-to-End Training:** Optimize all parameters ($\theta_{backbone}, \theta_{retriever}, \theta_{compressor}$) simultaneously using the hybrid loss. This might require careful gradient propagation through the discrete retrieval step (e.g., using Gumbel-Softmax or policy gradients from RL).
    2.  **Alternating Optimization:** Iterate between training the retriever (using RL with fixed backbone) and training the backbone/compressor (using supervised learning with fixed retriever policy).

### 3.7 Experimental Design

    *   Standard Transformer (e.g., BERT-large, T5-large) with context truncation.
    *   Standard Transformer + Full RAG (appending top-k retrieved documents).

        *   Retrieval Sparsity (average number/percentage of tokens retrieved per query).
        *   (Optional, if feasible) Oracle evaluation: Compare retrieved tokens against human-annotated relevant tokens.
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    *   Impact of the RL retriever vs. simpler retrieval (e.g., TF-IDF, dense retrieval without RL sparsity objective).
    *   Impact of sparse attention vs. full attention on the retrieved context.
    *   Impact of the rotating compressive KV cache vs. standard KV cache (truncation or full size).
    *   Sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters $\lambda_{retrieval}$ and $\lambda_{compute}$.
    *   Effectiveness of individual components (e.g., DySRA-SubQ vs. SubQ + Sparse Retrieval vs. SubQ + Compressive Cache).
