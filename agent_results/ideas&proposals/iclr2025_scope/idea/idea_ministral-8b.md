**Title:** "Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Efficient Contextual Processing"

**Motivation:** With the increasing demand for long context understanding and reasoning, foundation models need to efficiently adapt to new information while maintaining relevance and up-to-date knowledge. Current methods struggle with the trade-off between efficiency and contextual understanding, especially when dealing with growing knowledge bases. This research aims to address these challenges by developing an adaptive RAG system that can efficiently process and integrate new information, ensuring both relevance and up-to-date content.

**Main Idea:** The proposed research focuses on developing an adaptive RAG framework that leverages continual learning and efficient fine-tuning techniques to handle long contexts and new information streams. The system will employ a dynamic retrieval mechanism that adjusts the query-specific token fetching based on the current state of the knowledge base. Additionally, it will incorporate a mixture of experts (MoE) approach to adapt to various downstream tasks efficiently. The methodology involves designing a scalable and efficient fine-tuning algorithm that updates model weights continually, while also optimizing the retrieval process to minimize memory and computational costs. The expected outcomes include a more efficient and adaptive RAG system that can handle long contexts and new information streams effectively. The potential impact of this research is the development of foundation models that can quickly adapt to new knowledge, improving their relevance and utility in real-world applications.
