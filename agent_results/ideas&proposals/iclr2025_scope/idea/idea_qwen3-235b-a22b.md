1. **Title**: *Dynamic Sparse Activation with Compressive State Routing for Sub-Quadratic Foundation Models*  

2. **Motivation**:  
Sub-quadratic models address attention’s quadratic cost but struggle to balance efficiency, contextual adaptability, and personalization. Existing methods like MoE and compressive KV caching are often disjoint, leading to redundant computation when handling evolving tasks or long contexts. Efficient, unified mechanisms to dynamically adjust active model components and memory states are critical for real-time adaptation in resource-constrained scenarios.  

3. **Main Idea**:  
Propose a hybrid framework combining **sparsity** (via adaptive MoE routing) with **compressive state retention** (via sub-quadratic compressive KV states). Design an online router that dynamically selects task-specific experts *and* determines which historical tokens to retain/compress based on query complexity and task history. For instance, input tokens interact with a lightweight policy network that decides: (1) which MoE experts to activate for token-specific computation and (2) which key-value pairs in the cache to compress using learned low-rank projections. During continual fine-tuning, the router’s policy is updated via reinforcement learning to optimize a reward combining task accuracy, latency, and memory usage. Additionally, integrate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into the routing process: external knowledge retrieval triggers expert activation patterns tailored to the query’s novelty. Expected outcomes: (1) automated trade-off between computation/memory costs and performance, (2) faster adaptation to long-context, time-sensitive tasks (e.g., real-time news analysis with evolving KB), and (3) improved throughput for multimodal workloads (e.g., video summarization). Impact: Enables scalable, low-latency foundation models for adaptive inference in personalized and dynamic environments.
