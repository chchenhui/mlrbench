**Title:** Context-Adaptive KV Cache Compression for Efficient Long Context Adaptation

**Motivation:** Foundation models struggle with ever-growing context lengths, leading to prohibitive KV cache memory demands and slower inference, especially during continual adaptation or when using RAG. Static compression techniques often sacrifice crucial information needed for specific downstream tasks or recent data. This research aims to develop dynamic, context-aware KV cache compression for efficient adaptation.

**Main Idea:** We propose a lightweight "Contextual Importance Predictor" (CIP) module trained alongside the foundation model or during fine-tuning. Given the current query and existing KV cache state, the CIP predicts the task-specific relevance of each cached token. During inference, less relevant KV pairs (below a dynamically adjusted threshold based on available memory/latency budget) are aggressively compressed or pruned. This allows the model to retain critical information for the current context while drastically reducing the cache footprint. We will evaluate this on long-context tasks and continual learning benchmarks, expecting significant memory savings and faster adaptation with minimal performance degradation.
