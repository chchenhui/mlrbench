**1. Title**

**AutoPeri-GNN: An Equivariant Generative Framework with Automatic Periodicity Handling for Crystal Structure Design**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
The discovery and design of novel materials lie at the heart of technological progress, underpinning solutions to critical global challenges such as renewable energy generation (e.g., photovoltaics), energy storage (e.g., batteries), and environmental remediation (e.g., catalysis, clean water) [Task Description Overview]. Traditional materials discovery relies heavily on experimental trial-and-error and computationally intensive simulations (like Density Functional Theory - DFT), processes that are often slow, expensive, and limited in scope. Machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, has demonstrated transformative potential in accelerating scientific discovery, notably in domains like drug discovery and protein structure prediction [Task Description Overview]. Geometric deep learning, which leverages the inherent symmetries and structures of data, has shown particular promise for modeling atomic systems.

Applying ML to materials science, however, presents unique and significant challenges compared to modeling discrete molecules or linear protein sequences [Task Description Overview]. Crystalline materials, which constitute the vast majority of functional inorganic materials, possess inherent periodicity. Their structures are defined by a repeating unit cell within a lattice, subject to periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). This periodicity is fundamental to their properties but poses a major hurdle for standard ML architectures. Representing these infinite, repeating structures and ensuring that generated structures respect PBCs is non-trivial [Task Description: Challenge 1, Lit Review: Challenge 1]. Furthermore, generated structures must be physically plausible, adhering to principles of chemical bonding, charge neutrality, and thermodynamic stability [Lit Review: Challenge 2]. The sheer diversity of crystal structures, encompassing various symmetries and compositions, adds another layer of complexity [Task Description: Challenge 2, Lit Review: Challenge 4].

Recent years have seen growing interest in generative models for materials, aiming to navigate the vast chemical space and propose novel structures computationally. Works like those by Liu et al. (2023) explore self-supervised generative models using equivariant GNNs, and others like CrysGNN (Das et al., 2023) and CTGNN (Du et al., 2024) focus on enhancing property prediction using sophisticated graph representations [Lit Review: Papers 1, 2, 3]. However, robustly handling periodicity within the generative process itself, ensuring physical validity across boundaries, and generating diverse yet stable structures remain open challenges [Lit Review: Challenges 1, 2, 5].

**2.2 Problem Statement**
Current generative models for crystalline materials often struggle to explicitly and effectively incorporate the periodic nature of crystals directly into the representation learning and generation process. Many approaches either simplify the representation (losing information), treat periodicity as an afterthought (post-hoc checks), or require complex manual encoding of periodic information. This limitation hinders their ability to generate truly novel, diverse, and physically valid crystal structures that correctly capture the interactions and symmetries inherent in periodic systems. There is a pressing need for a generative framework that fundamentally integrates PBCs and physical constraints, enabling the automated design of promising crystalline materials.

**2.3 Proposed Solution: AutoPeri-GNN**
We propose **AutoPeri-GNN**, a novel generative framework based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) specifically designed for crystalline materials. AutoPeri-GNN aims to automatically handle PBCs by incorporating them directly into the graph representation and the network architecture. It conceptualizes a crystal's unit cell and its periodic images within a graph structure, where atoms are nodes and interatomic interactions, including those crossing unit cell boundaries, are edges explicitly marked with translation vectors. The core architecture employs an autoencoder structure built upon E(3)-equivariant GNNs, ensuring that learned representations and generated structures respect fundamental physical symmetries (translation, rotation, reflection). The encoder maps periodic crystal graphs to a latent space designed to capture salient structural and chemical features, while implicitly encoding periodicity. A normalizing flow-based generative model operates within this latent space, allowing for efficient sampling and likelihood estimation while potentially preserving learned symmetries. Crucially, AutoPeri-GNN integrates differentiable physics-based constraints, such as energy minimization (via surrogate potentials) and structural stability checks (e.g., minimum interatomic distances), directly into the training objective. This encourages the generation of physically realistic and potentially stable crystal structures.

**2.4 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:
1.  To design and implement the AutoPeri-GNN framework, including the periodic graph representation, the E(3)-equivariant autoencoder architecture, and the flow-based generative model.
2.  To develop and integrate mechanisms within the GNN architecture that explicitly and automatically account for periodic boundary conditions during message passing and representation learning.
3.  To incorporate differentiable physics-based loss terms (e.g., energy estimation, interatomic distance constraints) to guide the generation towards physically plausible and stable structures.
4.  To train AutoPeri-GNN on large-scale datasets of known crystalline materials (e.g., Materials Project, OQMD).
5.  To rigorously evaluate AutoPeri-GNN's ability to generate novel, diverse, unique, and valid crystal structures, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art generative models for materials using comprehensive metrics.
6.  To demonstrate the potential of AutoPeri-GNN for targeted material design by exploring conditional generation based on desired properties or compositions.

**2.5 Significance**
This research directly addresses the critical challenge of handling periodicity in ML models for materials science [Task Description: Challenge 1]. By developing AutoPeri-GNN, we aim to provide a powerful, automated tool for *de novo* crystal structure generation. Success would significantly accelerate the computational discovery of new materials with tailored properties, potentially impacting fields like renewable energy, electronics, and catalysis. Methodologically, it will advance geometric deep learning by proposing a novel architecture specifically handling periodic structures and integrating physical inductive biases [Task Description: Topics]. The framework's ability to generate diverse, valid candidates can drastically reduce the search space for expensive simulations (like DFT) and experiments, bridging the gap between computational prediction and practical materials realization.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Data Collection and Preparation**
*   **Datasets:** We will primarily utilize large, publicly available materials databases such as the Materials Project (MP) and the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD). We will initially focus on inorganic crystals, potentially filtering by criteria such as calculation stability (e.g., low energy above the convex hull), number of elements, or specific crystal systems to manage complexity. A representative dataset of ~100k-500k crystal structures will be curated.
*   **Graph Representation:** Each crystal structure, typically stored in Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format, will be converted into a periodic graph representation $G = (V, E, \mathbf{u})$.
    *   Nodes ($V$): Represent atoms in the unit cell. Node features $h_i$ will include atomic properties like atomic number, electronegativity, group/period, and potentially initial oxidation states. Initial Cartesian coordinates $\mathbf{r}_i$ within the unit cell will also be associated with each node.
    *   Edges ($E$): Represent interatomic connections (bonds or proximity). Edges will be established between atoms within a specified cutoff radius $r_{cut}$. Crucially, edges connecting an atom $i$ in the unit cell to a periodic image $j'$ of an atom $j$ (where $j'$ is related to $j$ by a lattice translation vector $\mathbf{T}$) will be included. Each edge $e_{ij'}$ will store the relative vector $\mathbf{r}_{ij'} = \mathbf{r}_{j'} - \mathbf{r}_i$ and the cell offset vector $\mathbf{T}_{ij'}$ indicating the lattice translation applied to atom $j$ to obtain $j'$. The lattice vectors defining the unit cell $\mathbf{L} = \{\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}\}$ will form the graph-level attribute $\mathbf{u}$.
*   **Data Splitting:** The curated dataset will be split into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 80%/10%/10% split) ensuring no structural overlap between sets based on composition and structure matching.

**3.2 AutoPeri-GNN Architecture**
The framework follows an autoencoder structure with a generative component operating in the latent space. E(3)-equivariance will be enforced throughout the GNN components.

*   **Encoder:** The encoder $Enc_{\phi}: G \rightarrow z$ maps the input periodic graph $G$ to a latent vector $z \in \mathbb{R}^d$.
    *   *Network:* We will employ an E(3)-equivariant GNN architecture, such as EGNN, SchNetPack (with directional embeddings), DimeNet++, or SEGNN, adapted for periodic inputs. These networks naturally handle 3D coordinates and are equivariant to rotations, translations, and reflections.
    *   *Periodicity Handling:* During message passing, the relative positions $\mathbf{r}_{ij'}$ and offset vectors $\mathbf{T}_{ij'}$ associated with edges connecting to periodic images will be explicitly used. For instance, in a message passing layer:
        $$ m_{ij'} = \phi_{m}(h_i^{(l)}, h_j^{(l)}, ||\mathbf{r}_{ij'}||, \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij'}, \mathbf{T}_{ij'}) $$
        $$ h_i^{(l+1)} = \phi_{u}(h_i^{(l)}, \sum_{j' \in \mathcal{N}(i)} m_{ij'}) $$
        where $h_i^{(l)}$ is the feature vector of node $i$ at layer $l$, $\mathcal{N}(i)$ includes neighbors within the unit cell and relevant periodic images, $\phi_m$ is the message function, and $\phi_u$ is the update function. The network learns to interpret the offset vectors $\mathbf{T}_{ij'}$ to understand the periodic context.
    *   *Output:* The final node embeddings are aggregated (e.g., via summation or mean pooling) along with the lattice information $\mathbf{L}$ to produce the latent representation $z$.
*   **Latent Space ($Z$):** The latent space aims to capture a compressed representation of the crystal structure. We will likely impose a prior distribution $p(z)$, commonly a standard Gaussian $z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$, especially if adopting a VAE-like structure. The dimensionality $d$ will be determined via hyperparameter tuning.
*   **Decoder/Generator:** The generator $Dec_{\theta}: z \rightarrow G'$ aims to reconstruct the input graph $G$ from $z$ (in autoencoder mode) or generate a new graph $G'$ from a sample $z \sim p(z)$ (in generative mode).
    *   *Network:* A corresponding E(3)-equivariant GNN architecture will be used for the decoder. It must output both the atomic positions within the unit cell (fractional coordinates $\mathbf{f}_i$ are often more convenient for periodic systems) and the lattice vectors $\mathbf{L}$. The generator must ensure consistency between the generated atoms and the lattice.
    *   *Generation Process:* We propose using a normalizing flow model (e.g., based on continuous normalizing flows adapted for graph structures or specifically E(3) equivariant flows) conditioned on $z$. Flows allow for exact likelihood computation and efficient sampling. The flow transforms a simple base distribution (e.g., Gaussian noise) into the complex distribution of crystal structures, guided by $z$. It will directly generate fractional coordinates $\{\mathbf{f}_i\}$ and lattice parameters $\mathbf{L}$. Cartesian coordinates $\mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{f}_i \mathbf{L}$ are then derived. $Dec_{\theta}: z \rightarrow (\{\mathbf{f}_i\}_{i=1}^N, \mathbf{L})$.
    *   *Periodicity Enforcement:* By generating fractional coordinates and lattice vectors directly, the periodic nature is inherent in the output representation. The decoder's training objective (reconstruction loss) implicitly teaches it to generate valid periodic structures.
*   **Equivariance:** Using E(3)-equivariant layers (like those found in EGNN or SEGNN) ensures that if the input crystal is rotated or translated, the latent representation transforms predictably, and the generated/reconstructed crystal exhibits the corresponding transformation, preserving physical consistency.

**3.3 Physics-Informed Constraints and Loss Function**
The training objective will combine multiple terms:
1.  **Reconstruction Loss ($L_{recon}$):** Measures the difference between the input crystal $G$ and the reconstructed crystal $G' = Dec_{\theta}(Enc_{\phi}(G))$. This could include Mean Squared Error (MSE) on atomic positions (potentially Minimum OSPA distance for permutation invariance) and lattice vectors, as well as cross-entropy for atom types.
    $$ L_{recon} = \lambda_{pos} L_{pos}(\mathbf{R}, \mathbf{R}') + \lambda_{lat} L_{lat}(\mathbf{L}, \mathbf{L}') + \lambda_{type} L_{type}(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{A}') $$
    where $\mathbf{R}, \mathbf{L}, \mathbf{A}$ are positions, lattice, and atom types respectively.
2.  **Latent Space Regularization ($L_{KL}$):** If using a VAE framework, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term encourages the posterior distribution $q_{\phi}(z|G)$ to match the prior $p(z)$.
    $$ L_{KL} = D_{KL}(q_{\phi}(z|G) || p(z)) $$
    For normalizing flows, the loss is typically the negative log-likelihood of the data under the flow transformation.
3.  **Physics-Based Losses ($L_{phys}$):**
    *   *Energy Minimization ($L_{energy}$):* We will incorporate a pre-trained universal graph neural network potential (GNNP), such as MACE or Allegro, or train a simpler one concurrently, to estimate the energy $E_{GNNP}(G')$ of the generated structure $G'$. This estimated energy will be added as a loss term, encouraging the generation of low-energy (more stable) configurations.
        $$ L_{energy} = E_{GNNP}(Dec_{\theta}(z)) $$
    *   *Stability Constraints ($L_{stability}$):* We will add penalty terms for violations of basic physical stability criteria, such as minimum interatomic distances. This prevents unrealistic structures with overlapping atoms.
        $$ L_{stability} = \sum_{i \ne j'} \text{ReLU}(d_{min} - ||\mathbf{r}_{ij'}||) $$
        where the sum runs over all unique atom pairs $(i, j')$ within a cutoff distance, including periodic images, and $d_{min}$ is a minimum allowable distance based on atomic radii. Charge neutrality constraints might also be added if applicable.

The total loss function will be a weighted sum:
$$ L_{total} = L_{recon} + \beta L_{KL} + \gamma_{E} L_{energy} + \gamma_{S} L_{stability} $$
The hyperparameters $\beta, \gamma_{E}, \gamma_{S}$ will be tuned on the validation set.

**3.4 Training Procedure**
*   **Optimizer:** Adam or AdamW optimizer.
*   **Learning Rate:** A learning rate schedule (e.g., cosine decay with warmup) will be employed.
*   **Batching:** Samples will be batched, handling variable graph sizes using techniques like padding or dedicated batching strategies for graphs.
*   **Hardware:** Training will require high-performance computing resources, primarily GPUs, due to the complexity of GNNs and large datasets. We estimate needing access to a cluster with multiple A100 or H100 GPUs.

**3.5 Experimental Design and Validation**
*   **Baselines:** We will compare AutoPeri-GNN against state-of-the-art generative models for crystals, including:
    *   CDVAE (Conditional Diffusion Variational Autoencoder for Periodic Material Generation)
    *   G-SchNet generative models
    *   FTCP (Flow-based Transformer for Crystal Properties - adapted for generation if possible)
    *   Potentially, the model from Liu et al. (2023) [Lit Review: Paper 1]
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** We will assess the generated structures based on standard metrics for generative chemistry/materials models:
    *   **Validity:** Percentage of generated structures passing physical and chemical validity checks (using tools like Pymatgen): charge neutrality, non-overlapping atoms (minimum distance checks), reasonable bond lengths/coordination numbers based on stoichiometry.
    *   **Novelty:** Percentage of valid generated structures that are structurally distinct (using structure matching algorithms like Pymatgen's `StructureMatcher`) from the training dataset.
    *   **Uniqueness:** Percentage of unique structures among the valid generated ones within a batch or sample set.
    *   **Diversity:** Assessed by comparing the distribution of properties (e.g., composition, density, space group symmetry, potentially predicted energy via GNNP or DFT) of generated structures against the training set and known materials. Structural diversity can be quantified using metrics based on structural fingerprints (e.g., pairwise distance distributions).
    *   **Reconstruction Accuracy:** Measure the autoencoder's ability to reconstruct input crystals (RMSE on positions, lattice parameters, atom type accuracy).
    *   **Property Consistency:** Correlation between target properties (if using conditional generation) and the properties of the generated structures (estimated via GNNP or limited DFT).
*   **Ablation Studies:** We will perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of key components:
    *   Effectiveness of the explicit PBC handling mechanism in the GNN.
    *   Impact of E(3)-equivariance vs. non-equivariant baselines.
    *   Contribution of the physics-based loss terms ($L_{energy}$, $L_{stability}$).
    *   Choice of generative model (flow vs. VAE/diffusion).
*   **Case Studies:** We will perform generation tasks for specific chemical systems (e.g., ternary oxides, stable electrides) or target properties (e.g., searching for structures with high predicted stability or specific symmetry groups). Promising novel candidates generated by AutoPeri-GNN will be further validated using DFT calculations to estimate their stability (e.g., energy above hull) and key properties.
