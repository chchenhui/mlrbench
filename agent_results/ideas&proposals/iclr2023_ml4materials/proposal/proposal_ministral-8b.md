## 2. Introduction

### Background

Materials discovery is a cornerstone of technological advancement, particularly in addressing global challenges such as renewable energy, energy storage, and clean water. The development of new materials often hinges on the discovery of novel crystalline structures, which are integral to technologies like solar cells, batteries, and catalysis. Machine learning has made significant strides in modeling drug-like molecules and proteins, including the discovery of new antibiotics and the prediction of 3D protein structures. However, the modeling of materials presents unique challenges, primarily due to their periodic structures and the need for materials-specific inductive biases.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a novel generative framework, AutoPeri-GNN, specifically designed for crystalline materials. This framework aims to address the challenges posed by periodic boundary conditions and physical validity in generating new crystal structures. The research will focus on:

1. Developing a graph-based representation of crystalline materials that can capture periodic boundary conditions.
2. Designing an equivariant graph neural network architecture that can learn and generate valid unit cells.
3. Incorporating physical constraints as differentiable losses to ensure energy minimization and structural stability.
4. Evaluating the performance of AutoPeri-GNN on benchmark datasets and comparing it with existing models.

### Significance

The successful development of AutoPeri-GNN has the potential to revolutionize materials discovery by significantly accelerating the process of generating new crystal structures with targeted properties. By addressing the fundamental periodic boundary challenge, this research aims to bridge the gap between machine learning and materials science, enabling the discovery of new materials that can drive technological innovations.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Collection

The dataset for this research will consist of a diverse set of crystalline materials, including inorganic crystals, polymers, catalytic surfaces, and nanoporous materials. The dataset will be curated from publicly available sources such as the Materials Project, Open Catalysis Consortium, and other relevant databases. The dataset will be preprocessed to extract relevant features such as atomic coordinates, chemical composition, and unit cell parameters.

### 3.2 Representation of Materials

Crystalline materials will be represented as graphs where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges. The graph will include node features representing atomic properties and edge features representing bond properties. The periodic boundary conditions will be explicitly encoded in the graph representation by duplicating the unit cell in multiple directions, ensuring that the graph remains invariant under translations.

### 3.3 Equivariant Graph Neural Network Architecture

AutoPeri-GNN will be based on an equivariant graph neural network architecture that can capture the symmetry operations common in crystal structures. The architecture will consist of the following components:

1. **Input Layer**: The input layer will take the graph representation of the crystal structure as input.
2. **Graph Convolutional Layers**: The model will employ multiple graph convolutional layers to learn node and edge features. The convolutional layers will be designed to be equivariant, ensuring that the model can handle periodic boundary conditions.
3. **Latent Space**: The latent space will be designed to capture the periodicity of the crystal structure. The latent space will be encoded using a specialized autoencoder architecture that explicitly encodes periodicity.
4. **Flow-based Generative Model**: The generative component will use a carefully designed flow-based model that preserves symmetry operations common in crystal structures. The flow-based model will generate new crystal structures by sampling from the latent space and decoding them into graph representations.

### 3.4 Physical Constraints

To ensure physical validity and stability, AutoPeri-GNN will incorporate physical constraints as differentiable losses. The constraints will include:

1. **Energy Minimization**: The model will be trained to minimize the energy of the generated crystal structures. This will be achieved by incorporating an energy function as a differentiable loss.
2. **Structural Stability**: The model will be trained to generate crystal structures that are stable under real-world conditions. This will be achieved by incorporating structural stability criteria as differentiable losses.

### 3.5 Experimental Design

The performance of AutoPeri-GNN will be evaluated on benchmark datasets of crystalline materials. The evaluation metrics will include:

1. **Generation Quality**: The quality of the generated crystal structures will be evaluated using metrics such as atomic coordinates accuracy, bond length accuracy, and unit cell parameters accuracy.
2. **Physical Validity**: The physical validity of the generated crystal structures will be evaluated using metrics such as energy minimization and structural stability.
3. **Diversity**: The diversity of the generated crystal structures will be evaluated using metrics such as the number of unique structures generated and the coverage of the structure space.

### 3.6 Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation metrics will be selected based on their relevance to the research objectives and the challenges posed by materials modeling. The metrics will include:

1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The MSE will be used to evaluate the accuracy of atomic coordinates, bond lengths, and unit cell parameters.
2. **Energy Loss**: The energy loss will be used to evaluate the energy minimization of the generated crystal structures.
3. **Stability Loss**: The stability loss will be used to evaluate the structural stability of the generated crystal structures.
4. **Diversity Metrics**: The diversity metrics will be used to evaluate the coverage of the structure space and the number of unique structures generated.
