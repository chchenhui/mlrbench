**2. Key Challenges**

1. **Periodic Boundary Conditions**: Effectively modeling the periodic nature of crystalline materials remains a significant challenge. Traditional generative models often struggle to incorporate periodic boundary conditions, leading to generated structures that may not accurately reflect the inherent periodicity of crystals.

2. **Physical Validity and Stability**: Ensuring that generated crystal structures are physically plausible and stable is crucial. Many generative models do not incorporate physical constraints, resulting in structures that may not be realizable or stable under real-world conditions.

3. **Data Scarcity and Quality**: High-quality, labeled datasets for crystalline materials are limited. This scarcity hampers the training of robust generative models and property predictors, as models may not generalize well when trained on small or biased datasets.

4. **Complexity of Crystal Structures**: Crystalline materials exhibit complex structures with varying symmetries and atomic arrangements. Capturing this complexity in a generative model requires sophisticated architectures capable of learning intricate patterns and relationships.

5. **Integration of Physical Laws**: Incorporating physical laws and constraints into machine learning models is challenging but necessary to ensure that generated structures adhere to known scientific principles. Balancing model flexibility with adherence to physical laws remains an ongoing challenge in the field.
