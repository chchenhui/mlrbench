Title: Periodic Equivariant Diffusion for Crystal Structure Generation

Motivation:  
Discovering novel crystalline materials underpins advances in energy storage, catalysis, and electronics. However, existing generative models struggle to represent and synthesize periodic boundary conditions and space‐group symmetries intrinsic to inorganic crystals. A specialized generative framework that natively handles lattice parameters, fractional atomic coordinates, and symmetry constraints could dramatically accelerate the identification of stable, synthesizable materials.

Main Idea:  
We propose “CrystalDiffusion,” a two‐stage diffusion model that jointly learns distributions over crystal lattices and atomic positions in fractional coordinates. Stage-1 diffuses lattice vectors encoded via Fourier features and radial basis representations; Stage-2 diffuses atomic site embeddings under fixed lattice geometry. Both stages employ an SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network augmented with space‐group symmetries to ensure invariance to rotations, translations, and periodic permutations. Training on the Materials Project dataset, the model is fine-tuned with energy‐based objectives (e.g., DFT formation energies) to bias generation toward thermodynamic stability. Generated candidates are validated via a lightweight ML potential before DFT refinement. Expected outcomes include high novelty, stability, and property‐targeted crystal designs. This approach will open new avenues for automated, scalable inorganic materials discovery under realistic periodic constraints.
