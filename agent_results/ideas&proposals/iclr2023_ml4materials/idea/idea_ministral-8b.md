### Title: **Geometric Deep Learning for Condensed Phase Materials Discovery**

### Motivation
The discovery of new materials is crucial for addressing global challenges such as renewable energy and clean water. However, traditional methods are time-consuming and inefficient. Machine learning, particularly geometric deep learning, offers a promising approach to model and discover new materials. While significant progress has been made in molecular and protein modeling, the condensed phase materials present unique challenges due to their periodic boundary conditions and lack of intuitive representations. This research aims to develop geometric deep learning models that can effectively represent and discover new materials in the condensed phase.

### Main Idea
To address the challenges of modeling condensed phase materials, we propose a methodology that leverages geometric deep learning techniques. Specifically, we will develop a novel representation of materials that takes into account their periodic boundary conditions. This representation will be used to train generative models that can discover new materials with desired properties. The methodology will involve the following steps:

1. **Representation Learning**: Develop a new representation for materials that can capture their periodic nature. This could involve using graph neural networks with periodic boundary conditions or employing other geometric deep learning techniques.

2. **Generative Modeling**: Train generative models, such as variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, using the newly developed representations. These models will learn to generate new materials with specified properties.

3. **Validation and Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the generative models using benchmark datasets and compare them with existing methods. Additionally, integrate experimental data to validate the discovered materials.

The expected outcomes of this research include:
- A novel representation of materials that can effectively capture their periodic nature.
- Generative models capable of discovering new materials with desired properties.
- Benchmark datasets and tools for evaluating the performance of machine learning models in materials discovery.

The potential impact of this research is significant. It could revolutionize the field of materials science by providing a faster and more efficient way to discover new materials. This could lead to the development of new technologies and solutions to global challenges. Additionally, the novel representations and generative models developed in this research could be applied to other domains, such as drug discovery and protein folding.
