**Title:** Periodic Crystal Diffusion Network: Geometry-Aware Generative Modeling for Crystalline Materials  

**Motivation:** Current generative models for materials often fail to capture the intricate periodic symmetry and physical constraints of crystalline structures, leading to unrealistic or unstable designs. The inability to reliably generate valid crystal unit cells hinders the discovery of novel materials for applications like batteries or catalysts, where atomic arrangement under periodic boundary conditions is critical.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a diffusion-based generative model explicitly conditioned on crystallographic symmetry and lattice parameters. The model employs a Euclidean graph neural network (GNN) with periodic edge connections, encoding atomic positions relative to lattice vectors and incorporating symmetry operations via equivariant message passing. Training leverages datasets like the Materials Project, pairing generated structures with stability metrics. Key innovations include a lattice-aware diffusion process for simultaneous atom/lattice generation and physics-informed loss terms penalizing high-energy configurations. This approach aims to yield synthesizable, thermodynamically stable crystals with target properties, drastically accelerating materials discovery pipelines.
