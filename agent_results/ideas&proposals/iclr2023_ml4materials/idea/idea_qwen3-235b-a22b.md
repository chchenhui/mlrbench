**Title:** Symmetry-Driven Generative Models for Materials Discovery  

**Motivation:** Materials discovery is bottlenecked by the lack of machine learning (ML) models that respect physical laws and structural symmetries inherent to materials, such as translational and rotational invariances under periodic boundary conditions. Current generative models often ignore these constraints, leading to inefficient exploration of material spaces and physically implausible predictions. Developing symmetry-aware models could unlock rapid discovery of materials for energy storage, catalysis, and more.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a generative framework using **equivariant neural networks** that intrinsically encode material symmetries. The model will combine geometric deep learning with crystallographic priors (e.g., space groups, lattice parameters) to ensure generated structures adhere to physical constraints. A hybrid architecture will integrate graph-based representations for atomic interactions and Fourier-space components to model long-range periodicity. Training will leverage multi-modal datasets (e.g., crystallographic databases, DFT simulations) and incorporate physics-informed loss functions to enforce stability. Expected outcomes include a 20â€“30% improvement in generating synthesizable materials compared to conventional GANs/VAEs, with applications to battery electrolytes and catalysts. This work bridges the gap between ML and materials science, enabling efficient, physics-guided discovery pipelines for real-world applications.
