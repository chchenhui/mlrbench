**Title:** Periodic Equivariant Diffusion Models for Crystal Structure Generation

**Motivation:** Generating novel, stable crystalline materials *de novo* is a grand challenge. Current generative models often struggle to properly handle the periodic boundary conditions and symmetry constraints inherent to crystals, limiting their effectiveness. This research aims to develop generative models that natively incorporate these physical inductive biases.

**Main Idea:** We propose a diffusion-based generative model operating directly on crystal representations defined by fractional atomic coordinates and lattice vectors within the unit cell. The diffusion process (noise addition and denoising) will be designed to be equivariant to translations, rotations, and permutations, while explicitly respecting periodic boundary conditions. Symmetry constraints can be incorporated either by data augmentation or by designing symmetry-equivariant denoising networks (e.g., leveraging SE(3)-equivariant graph networks adapted for periodicity). Training on databases like the Materials Project will allow the model to learn the manifold of stable crystal structures. Conditioning on target properties (e.g., formation energy, electronic band gap) will enable guided generation of novel, physically plausible materials with desired functionalities. This approach promises more efficient exploration of the vast chemical space for crystalline solids.
