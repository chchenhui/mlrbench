# AutoPeri-GNN: Periodic Graph Neural Networks for Crystal Generative Modeling

## Motivation
Materials discovery is crucial for addressing global challenges in renewable energy and energy storage. While machine learning has revolutionized drug and protein modeling, materials present unique challenges due to their periodic structures. Current generative models struggle with the periodic boundary conditions inherent in crystalline materials, limiting their effectiveness. There's an urgent need for specialized architectures that can properly represent and generate novel crystalline structures while maintaining physical validity across periodic boundaries.

## Main Idea
AutoPeri-GNN is a novel generative framework specifically designed for crystalline materials that automatically handles periodic boundary conditions. The approach combines equivariant graph neural networks with a specialized autoencoder architecture that explicitly encodes periodicity in the latent space. By representing crystals as graphs where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges, our model learns to generate valid unit cells with proper periodic connections. The framework incorporates physical constraints as differentiable losses, ensuring energy minimization and structural stability. The generative component uses a carefully designed flow-based model that preserves symmetry operations common in crystal structures. AutoPeri-GNN can generate diverse yet physically plausible crystal structures for targeted properties, accelerating materials discovery by orders of magnitude compared to traditional computational methods, while addressing the fundamental periodic boundary challenge unique to materials science.
