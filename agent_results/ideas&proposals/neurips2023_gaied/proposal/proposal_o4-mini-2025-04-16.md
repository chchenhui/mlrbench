1. Title  
Generative AI as a Socratic Learning Partner for Collaborative Inquiry  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Collaborative inquiry and Socratic dialogue have long been recognized as powerful pedagogical approaches to foster critical thinking, metacognition, and deep understanding. In traditional classroom and small-group settings, peer interactions guided by probing questions can stimulate reflection, self-explanation, and iterative problem solving. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) (e.g., GPT-4, PaLM) have enabled generative AI systems capable of carrying on sophisticated multi-turn dialogues. However, most AI-based tutors today act as answer-providing or feedback-giving agents, often short-circuited towards providing direct solutions rather than guiding students through a process of inquiry. Existing systems (e.g., SocratiQ, EduChat, SPL) demonstrate the promise of Socratic and adaptive learning companions but leave open challenges in authenticity of question generation, personalization, and robust evaluation of pedagogical effectiveness.  

Research Objectives  
This research aims to design, implement, and evaluate an LLM-based Socratic learning partner (SLP) that simulates authentic peer-led inquiry across STEM problem-solving scenarios. Specifically we will:  
• Develop prompting and fine-tuning strategies that reinforce Socratic behaviors—probing questions, request for justification, constructive challenges—without revealing direct answers.  
• Construct a curated dialogue corpus annotated with Socratic moves and student reasoning to serve as a fine-tuning and evaluation benchmark.  
• Propose a multi-task learning framework and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to optimize the agent for both question quality and student learning gains.  
• Design and conduct controlled user studies comparing SLP against a baseline AI tutor, measuring critical thinking, metacognitive gains, and learning outcomes.  

Significance  
By shifting from answer-centric tutoring to process-oriented inquiry, SLP promises to enhance students’ reasoning skills, self-explanation, and ability to self-correct. The scalable AI partner can operate 24/7, complement classroom activities, and reduce instructor burden. Insights from this research will advance generative educational AI and help set new standards for interactive pedagogy evaluation.  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Overview  
Our methodology comprises four stages: (1) Data collection and annotation, (2) Model design and training, (3) Agent deployment, (4) Experimental evaluation.  

3.2 Data Collection and Annotation  
• Source material: We will collect ~5,000 human-tutored Socratic dialogues from online STEM tutoring platforms (physics, mathematics, chemistry).  
• Annotation schema: Adapted from SocratiQ and SPL, each tutor turn is labeled with a “Socratic move” tag: {Probe, Prompt for Reasoning, Challenge, Reflective Summary}. Student turns are annotated for “Cognitive Response” levels: {Answer, Partial Explanation, Metacognitive Reflection, Self-Correction}.  
• Annotation process: Two educational researchers will annotate each dialogue segment; inter-annotator agreement (Cohen’s κ) target ≥ 0.75. Conflicts adjudicated by a third expert.  

3.3 Model Architecture and Training  
3.3.1 Pre-training and Fine-tuning  
We start from a publicly available LLM (e.g., LLaMA-2 13B). Our training objective combines supervised fine-tuning on annotated Socratic dialogues with an auxiliary Socratic-move classification loss. Let the dialogue context be $C = \{u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n\}$, and the target tutor utterance $u_{n+1}$. We minimize:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{FT}} = -\sum_{t=1}^{T}\log p(u_{n+1}^t\mid C; \theta)  
$$  
where $u_{n+1}^t$ is the $t$-th token of the target utterance. Simultaneously, for each generated turn we predict its Socratic move label $m \in \{1,\dots,4\}$ with cross‐entropy loss:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{k=1}^{4} y_{i,k}\log q(m=k\mid u_{n+1}; \phi)  
$$  
where $y_{i,k}$ is the annotated one-hot label for the $i$th example. The combined loss is:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{joint}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{FT}} + \lambda\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}}  
$$  
with $\lambda$ tuned on a held-out validation set.  

3.3.2 Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)  
To further encourage high-quality Socratic questioning, we employ RLHF. We define a reward model $r(C, u_{n+1})$ trained to predict human ratings of question quality and impact on student reasoning. The policy $\pi_\theta$ (the finetuned LLM) is updated via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO):  
$$  
\max_\theta \mathbb{E}_{u\sim\pi_\theta}\Big[r(C,u)\Big] - \beta\,\mathrm{KL}\big(\pi_\theta\|\pi_{\text{ref}}\big)  
$$  
where $\pi_{\text{ref}}$ is the reference policy (pretrained LLM) and $\beta$ is a regularization coefficient.  

3.3.3 Prompt Engineering  
For zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, we design prompts that steer the model towards Socratic behavior. A template:  
“Given the student’s attempt: ‘<student answer>’, do NOT give the solution. Instead, ask a probing question that (1) uncovers assumptions, (2) invites explanation, or (3) challenges reasoning.”  
We will empirically test multiple prompt variants and incorporate successful templates into the final system.  

3.4 Agent Deployment  
The trained model is wrapped in an interactive chat interface. It tracks per-session student profiles (prior performance, topic progress) to personalize question difficulty. A component logs:  
• Number of Socratic moves used per session.  
• Student response patterns (length, reasoning depth).  
• Timing metrics (response latency, turn‐taking rhythm).  

3.5 Experimental Design  
3.5.1 Participants and Conditions  
We will recruit N=120 undergraduate STEM students and randomly assign them to two conditions:  
• SLP condition: Interact with our Socratic Learning Partner.  
• Baseline condition: Interact with a conventional AI tutor that provides hints and direct feedback.  

Each participant engages in three 45-minute problem-solving sessions over one week.  

3.5.2 Measures and Instruments  
Learning Gains  
• Pre- and post-tests on targeted STEM concepts (20 multiple-choice + 5 open-ended problems). Gain measured by normalized improvement:  
$$  
\Delta = \frac{\text{PostScore} - \text{PreScore}}{100 - \text{PreScore}}  
$$  
Critical Thinking and Reflection  
• Coding of transcripts for incidence of self-explanation and self-correction.  
• Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI) administered pre- and post-study.  
Engagement and Satisfaction  
• System Usability Scale (SUS) and custom survey on perceived support for inquiry.  

3.5.3 Evaluation Metrics  
• Question Quality: Rated by blind experts on a 5-point scale (probing depth, relevance).  
• Student Reasoning Depth: Average length and complexity of student turns (measured by syntactic parse tree depth and semantic similarity to expert explanations).  
• Learning Outcome: $\Delta$ as defined above.  
• Metacognitive Gain: Change in MAI score.  
Statistical Analysis  
We will use ANCOVA with pre-test scores as covariates to compare learning gains; t-tests for survey responses; mixed-effects models to account for repeated measures across sessions.  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Expected Outcomes  
• A working prototype of SLP that reliably generates authentic Socratic questions in STEM dialogues.  
• Empirical evidence on the benefits of Socratic inquiry vs. answer-providing tutoring in terms of critical thinking, metacognitive awareness, and concept mastery.  
• A publicly available annotated dialogue dataset and evaluation benchmark for future research on Socratic AI tutoring.  
Impact  
Educational Practice  
SLP can be integrated into online learning platforms and classrooms to supplement instructor-led discussions, offering scalable peer-like interactions. By focusing on inquiry, students may develop transferable reasoning skills applicable beyond specific content domains.  
Generative AI Research  
Our joint supervised plus RLHF framework and Socratic-move annotation schema will contribute new methods for aligning generative models with pedagogical objectives. The reward modeling for question quality can inform other dialog systems requiring interactive nuance.  
Policy and Ethics  
Demonstrating how generative AI can be harnessed for reflective inquiry rather than rote answer delivery may guide policymakers in promoting AI tools that cultivate higher-order thinking and reduce academic integrity concerns around answer generation.  

5. Conclusion and Future Work  
This proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to develop and validate a Socratic learning partner powered by generative AI. By combining rigorous data annotation, multi-task fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and controlled user studies, we aim to push the frontier of AI-mediated collaborative inquiry. Future directions include extending the agent to multi-agent group scenarios, cross-domain adaptation beyond STEM, and integrating emotion and motivation modeling to enrich the Socratic experience. Ultimately, this work seeks to transform generative AI from an answer machine into a catalyst for genuine intellectual engagement and lifelong learning.
