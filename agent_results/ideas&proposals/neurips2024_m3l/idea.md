**Title:** Optimal Data Epochs in LLM Pretraining: Balancing Efficiency and Representation Quality

**Motivation:** Pretraining large language models (LLMs) requires vast datasets and compute. Repeating data epochs (data recycling) is common practice to reduce data requirements or extend training, but its theoretical impact on model convergence, generalization, and the quality of learned representations is poorly understood. This research aims to provide principled guidelines for data recycling in the large model era.

**Main Idea:** We propose developing a theoretical framework to analyze the effect of multiple data passes during LLM pretraining. This involves modeling how data repetition influences gradient statistics (e.g., variance, correlation across epochs), loss landscape dynamics, and potential overfitting or "memorization" of the pretraining corpus. We will leverage tools from stochastic optimization theory and potentially information geometry to derive bounds relating the number of epochs to convergence speed, generalization performance on downstream tasks, and measures of representation quality. Expected outcomes include theoretically grounded heuristics for choosing the number of data passes based on dataset size, diversity, model scale, and compute budget, validated through controlled experiments on representative model architectures. This could significantly optimize resource allocation for LLM training.
