Title: "Phase Transitions in Scaling Laws: Understanding Emergent Abilities in Foundation Models via Critical Phenomena"

Motivation: Foundation models exhibit emergent abilities (e.g., few-shot reasoning) that appear abruptly as model size/data/compute scale, but current scaling laws fail to explain these sharp transitions. A mathematical framework explaining such "phase transitions" could reduce trial-and-error in large-scale training and enable intentional design of architectures with controlled emergent properties.

Main Idea: We propose to model scaling of foundation models using concepts from statistical physics, where emergent abilities correspond to critical phenomena arising at phase transition boundaries. Specifically: (1) Develop analytical models of loss landscapes as functions of model width/depth, data diversity, and compute budget, identifying order parameters (e.g., attention entropy, feature learning thresholds) that act as "order parameters" for emergent capabilities; (2) Derive scaling exponents through renormalization group theory, connecting architectural choices (e.g., transformer depth/width) to universality classes of emergent behavior; (3) Validate predictions by measuring sharp transitions in in-context learning accuracy or probing task performance across 1000Ã— parameter/compute scales. Expected outcomes include a theory predicting minimal compute-optimal scaling regimes for targeting specific emergent abilities, with immediate impact on cost-efficient foundation model design and controllable architectural evolution.
