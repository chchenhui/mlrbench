### Title: Continuous Approximations of Training Trajectories for Deep Learning Optimization

### Motivation
The success of deep learning has been largely empirical, with little theoretical guidance. Understanding and approximating the training trajectories of deep learning models can provide insights into optimization dynamics and improve convergence rates. This is crucial as we move towards large-scale models, where computational costs are prohibitive. By exploring continuous approximations of training trajectories, we can bridge the gap between theory and practice, leading to more efficient and effective training algorithms.

### Main Idea
This research idea focuses on approximating discrete-time gradient dynamics in deep learning with continuous counterparts, such as gradient flow or stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The methodology involves:

1. **Discretization Analysis:** Investigate how discrete-time gradient updates can be approximated using continuous-time dynamics.
2. **Validation of Approximations:** Establish conditions under which these continuous approximations are valid and provide insights into convergence properties.
3. **Theoretical Framework:** Develop a theoretical framework that links these approximations to the optimization landscape and gradient noise, providing principled ways to design faster and more robust training algorithms.

Expected outcomes include:
- **Enhanced Convergence Analysis:** Improved understanding of the Edge of Stability (EoS) and how to navigate it effectively.
- **Practical Algorithms:** Designing advanced optimization algorithms that leverage continuous approximations for faster convergence.
- **Scalability:** Providing theoretical guarantees for the scalability of optimization methods in large-scale deep learning.

Potential impact:
- **Efficiency:** Reducing the computational cost and time required for training large models.
- **Guidance:** Offering theoretical guidance for practitioners, making deep learning less of an art and more of a science.
- **Innovation:** Inspiring new research directions and fostering collaboration between theoretical and applied machine learning communities.
