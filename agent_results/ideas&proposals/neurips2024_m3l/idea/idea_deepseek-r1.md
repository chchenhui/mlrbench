**Title:** Understanding Adam's Superiority on Transformers: Gradient Structure and Adaptive Optimization  

**Motivation:** Transformers underpin modern foundation models, yet their optimization remains poorly understood. Despite Adam’s empirical dominance over SGD in training Transformers, theoretical explanations for this remain elusive. Addressing this gap is crucial to designing efficient optimizers for billion-scale models, reducing trial-and-error costs.  

**Main Idea:** This work investigates how Adam’s adaptive learning rates align with Transformers’ unique gradient structures. The hypothesis is that Transformers exhibit *layer-wise gradient heterogeneity*—e.g., self-attention layers generate sparse, skewed gradients, while feed-forward layers produce denser ones—and Adam’s per-parameter adaptation mitigates instability from such variability.  

**Methodology:**  
1. Empirically profile gradient statistics (magnitude, variance, sparsity) across Transformer layers during training.  
2. Model the interaction between Adam’s update rules (momentum, variance normalization) and gradient structures via a dynamical systems lens, incorporating Transformer-specific components (e.g., layer norm, residual connections).  
3. Design controlled experiments with synthetic gradients and modified architectures to isolate key factors.  

**Outcomes & Impact:** A theoretical framework linking Adam’s effectiveness to architectural inductive biases in Transformers, enabling principled optimizer design (e.g., layer-adaptive learning rates). This could yield faster convergence, reduced hyperparameter sensitivity, and energy-efficient training protocols for large models.
