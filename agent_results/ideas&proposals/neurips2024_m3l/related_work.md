**Key Challenges:**

1. **Overfitting Due to Data Repetition**: Excessive data recycling can lead to overfitting, where the model memorizes the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns, resulting in poor performance on unseen tasks.

2. **Balancing Data Efficiency and Model Performance**: Determining the optimal number of data passes is challenging, as insufficient repetition may hinder convergence, while excessive repetition can waste resources and degrade performance.

3. **Lack of Theoretical Frameworks**: There is a need for robust theoretical models to understand the impact of data recycling on training dynamics, convergence speed, and generalization, which are currently underdeveloped.

4. **Resource Constraints**: Efficiently utilizing computational resources during LLM pretraining is critical, and improper data recycling strategies can lead to unnecessary computational overhead.

5. **Data Quality Assessment**: Developing reliable metrics to assess and select high-quality data for recycling is essential to ensure that repeated data exposure contributes positively to model training.
