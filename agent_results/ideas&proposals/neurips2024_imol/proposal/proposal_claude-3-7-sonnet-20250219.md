# Adaptive Contextual Goal Generation for Lifelong Learning via Hierarchical Intrinsic Motivation

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Autonomous lifelong learning agents that develop broad and flexible repertoires of knowledge and skills represent a foundational goal in artificial intelligence research. While recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have yielded impressive results in specific domains, these systems still lack the versatility and adaptability exhibited by humans and other animals when confronted with novel situations or changing environments. Current AI systems typically rely on predefined reward functions and task specifications, limiting their capacity to generalize beyond their training environments and hindering their potential for open-ended learning.

Intrinsically motivated learning, also known as curiosity-driven learning, offers a promising framework for addressing these limitations (Oudeyer et al., 2007; Barto, 2013). By drawing inspiration from the intrinsic drives that motivate exploratory behavior in biological organisms (White, 1959; Berlyne, 1960), researchers have developed computational models that enable agents to autonomously explore complex environments without relying on external reward signals. This approach has contributed to recent breakthroughs in reinforcement learning (Pathak et al., 2017; Burda et al., 2019; Eysenbach et al., 2019), demonstrating the potential of intrinsic motivation to support open-ended learning.

Despite these advances, current intrinsically motivated systems face several critical limitations. Most implementations utilize static intrinsic reward mechanisms, predetermined goal spaces, or fixed exploration strategies that fail to adapt to the evolving needs and capabilities of the agent or the changing properties of the environment. Additionally, these systems often struggle to retain and transfer knowledge across diverse contexts, limiting their ability to build upon previously acquired skills and knowledge in a cumulative fashion.

### Research Objectives

This research aims to develop a novel framework for Intrinsically Motivated Open-ended Learning (IMOL) that enables artificial agents to dynamically generate, prioritize, and pursue contextually relevant goals through a hierarchical architecture. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Design a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture that separates high-level goal generation from low-level skill execution, allowing for adaptive goal setting based on environmental context and agent capabilities.

2. Develop a meta-reinforcement learning mechanism that learns to dynamically adjust intrinsic motivation strategies based on environmental statistics and learning progress.

3. Create a skill library system that enables efficient retention, retrieval, and transfer of learned behaviors across diverse tasks and environments.

4. Evaluate the proposed framework's effectiveness in fostering open-ended learning across a range of complex, procedurally generated environments.

### Significance

The proposed research addresses fundamental challenges in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly concerning the development of autonomous systems capable of open-ended learning. By enabling agents to contextually adapt their intrinsic goals and motivations, this work could significantly enhance the generalizability and versatility of AI systems, allowing them to thrive in dynamic, unpredictable real-world environments.

From a theoretical perspective, this research contributes to our understanding of the computational principles underlying intrinsically motivated learning and developmental processes. The proposed hierarchical framework offers insights into how different motivational mechanisms can be integrated and modulated based on contextual factors, potentially informing theories of human cognitive development and intrinsic motivation.

From a practical standpoint, the development of adaptive, context-sensitive intrinsically motivated agents could have significant implications for robotics, autonomous systems, and intelligent tutoring systems. Such agents could adapt to novel environments without human intervention, learn from minimal supervision, and continuously expand their capabilities through self-directed exploration and learning.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed methodology integrates hierarchical reinforcement learning with adaptive intrinsic motivation mechanisms to enable contextual goal generation and lifelong skill acquisition. The framework consists of four key components: (1) a hierarchical policy architecture, (2) a contextual goal generation mechanism, (3) an adaptive intrinsic motivation module, and (4) a skill library for knowledge retention and transfer.

### 2.1 Hierarchical Policy Architecture

We employ a two-level hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture that separates goal setting from skill execution:

1. **Meta-Level Policy ($\pi_{\text{meta}}$)**: Responsible for generating contextually appropriate goals based on the current environmental state and the agent's capability profile.

2. **Skill-Level Policies ($\pi_{\text{skill}}$)**: A collection of policies that learn to achieve specific goals generated by the meta-level policy.

The meta-level policy operates at a slower timescale, selecting goals that the skill-level policies pursue over extended episodes. Formally, given an environment state $s_t$ at time $t$, the meta-level policy generates a goal $g_t \sim \pi_{\text{meta}}(g|s_t, c_t)$, where $c_t$ represents the contextual information extracted from the environment. The skill-level policy then selects actions according to $a_t \sim \pi_{\text{skill}}(a|s_t, g_t)$ to achieve the designated goal.

### 2.2 Contextual Goal Generation

The contextual goal generation mechanism consists of three primary components:

1. **Context Encoder**: A neural network that extracts relevant features from the environment state, represented as:
   $$h_t = f_{\text{encoder}}(s_t)$$
   
   This encoder will be implemented as a convolutional neural network for visual inputs and fully-connected layers for vectorized state representations.

2. **Environmental Statistics Module**: Analyzes the environment to extract statistics that inform goal selection, including:
   - **Dynamical predictability**: Measures how predictable the environment dynamics are, calculated as the mean squared error of a learned dynamics model:
     $$\text{DP}_t = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \|f_{\text{dynamics}}(s_{t-i}, a_{t-i}) - s_{t-i+1}\|^2$$
   
   - **Task complexity**: Estimated through state entropy or the number of distinct states visited in recent history:
     $$\text{TC}_t = -\sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}_{\text{recent}}} p(s) \log p(s)$$
   
   - **Resource availability**: Tracked through environment-specific indicators.

3. **Attention-Based Goal Selector**: Uses an attention mechanism to weight different environmental factors when generating goals:
   $$\alpha_t = \text{softmax}(W_{\alpha} \cdot [h_t, \text{DP}_t, \text{TC}_t, ...])$$
   $$g_t = f_{\text{goal}}(h_t, \alpha_t)$$

   where $\alpha_t$ represents attention weights over environmental statistics and $f_{\text{goal}}$ is a neural network that maps the attended context to a goal representation.

### 2.3 Adaptive Intrinsic Motivation Module

The adaptive intrinsic motivation module generates intrinsic rewards that guide skill learning based on both the current goal and the agent's learning progress. We implement multiple intrinsic motivation signals that are dynamically weighted according to the current context:

1. **Prediction Error-Based Curiosity**:
   $$r_{\text{pred}}(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) = \|f_{\text{forward}}(s_t, a_t) - s_{t+1}\|^2$$

2. **Information Gain**:
   $$r_{\text{info}}(s_t) = H(s_t | D_{t-1}) - H(s_t | D_t)$$
   
   where $D_t$ represents the agent's experience up to time $t$, and $H$ denotes entropy.

3. **Learning Progress**:
   $$r_{\text{prog}}(g_t) = \left| \frac{d}{dt} \text{Error}(g_t) \right|$$
   
   measuring the rate of change in the error for achieving goal $g_t$.

4. **Skill Diversity**:
   $$r_{\text{div}}(s_t, a_t) = \min_{(s_i, a_i) \in \mathcal{M}} d((s_t, a_t), (s_i, a_i))$$
   
   where $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of state-action pairs in the agent's memory, and $d$ is a distance function.

The overall intrinsic reward is a weighted combination of these signals:
$$r_{\text{intrinsic}}(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, g_t) = \sum_{i \in \{\text{pred}, \text{info}, \text{prog}, \text{div}\}} w_i(c_t) \cdot r_i$$

where $w_i(c_t)$ are context-dependent weights learned through meta-reinforcement learning.

### 2.4 Skill Library for Knowledge Retention and Transfer

To facilitate lifelong learning, we implement a skill library that stores, organizes, and retrieves learned skills:

1. **Skill Embedding**: Each acquired skill is represented by an embedding vector that captures its functionality:
   $$e_{\text{skill}} = f_{\text{embed}}(g, \pi_{\text{skill}})$$

2. **Hierarchical Skill Organization**: Skills are organized in a hierarchical structure based on their embedding similarity and compositional relationships.

3. **Skill Retrieval**: Given a new goal $g_{\text{new}}$, the agent retrieves the most relevant skills from the library:
   $$\pi_{\text{retrieved}} = \arg\max_{\pi \in \text{Library}} \text{sim}(f_{\text{embed}}(g_{\text{new}}), e_{\pi})$$

4. **Few-Shot Transfer**: Retrieved skills are adapted to new goals through meta-learning techniques, specifically Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML):
   $$\theta_{\text{adapted}} = \theta_{\text{retrieved}} - \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}(\theta_{\text{retrieved}}, \mathcal{D}_{\text{new}})$$

### 2.5 Learning Algorithm

The overall learning process integrates multiple reinforcement learning techniques:

1. **Meta-Policy Learning**: The meta-level policy is updated using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a reward that reflects the skill-level policy's performance and diversity:
   $$r_{\text{meta}}(g_t) = \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_{\text{skill}}} \left[ r_{\text{intrinsic}}(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, g_t) + \lambda_{\text{div}} \cdot \text{Diversity}(g_t) \right]$$

2. **Skill-Policy Learning**: Skill policies are updated using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with the intrinsic reward signal:
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{skill}} = \mathbb{E}_{(s, a, s', g) \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ -Q(s, a, g) + \alpha \cdot H(\pi_{\text{skill}}(\cdot|s, g)) \right]$$

3. **Contextual Weight Adaptation**: The weights for different intrinsic motivation components are updated through meta-gradient descent:
   $$w_i \leftarrow w_i + \beta \nabla_{w_i} \mathbb{E}_{g \sim \pi_{\text{meta}}} \left[ \text{Performance}(\pi_{\text{skill}}, g) \right]$$

### 2.6 Experimental Design

To evaluate our framework, we will conduct experiments across a diverse set of environments that vary in complexity, dynamics, and resource distribution:

1. **Procedurally Generated Navigation Environments**: 3D mazes with varying layouts, obstacles, and resource distributions.

2. **Multi-Object Manipulation Tasks**: Environments requiring the manipulation of multiple objects with different physical properties.

3. **Resource Management Scenarios**: Tasks involving dynamic resource allocation and management under varying constraints.

Each environment will be designed with controllable parameters to systematically vary task complexity, dynamical predictability, and resource availability.

#### Evaluation Metrics

We will evaluate our approach using the following metrics:

1. **Task Coverage**: The diversity and complexity of tasks that the agent can successfully complete:
   $$\text{Coverage} = \frac{|\text{Tasks Completed}|}{|\text{Task Space}|}$$

2. **Adaptation Speed**: The time required to adapt to novel environments or tasks:
   $$\text{Adaptation} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{E}_{\text{novel}}|} \sum_{e \in \mathcal{E}_{\text{novel}}} \text{Steps to Criterion}(e)$$

3. **Skill Reusability**: The extent to which learned skills can be transferred to new contexts:
   $$\text{Reusability} = \frac{\text{Performance with Transfer}}{\text{Performance without Transfer}}$$

4. **Learning Progress Efficiency**: The rate of improvement relative to the amount of experience:
   $$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{d\text{Performance}}{d\text{Experience}}$$

5. **Exploration Quality**: Measured by state space coverage and discovery of novel states:
   $$\text{Exploration} = \frac{|\text{States Visited}|}{|\text{State Space}|} + \lambda \cdot \text{Novelty Rate}$$

#### Comparative Analysis

We will compare our approach against several baselines:

1. **Static Intrinsic Motivation**: Systems with fixed curiosity-based rewards.
2. **Random Goal Generation**: Hierarchical RL with random goal selection.
3. **Non-hierarchical Approaches**: End-to-end RL with various intrinsic motivation mechanisms.
4. **Fixed Goal Space Methods**: Hierarchical RL with predefined goal spaces.
