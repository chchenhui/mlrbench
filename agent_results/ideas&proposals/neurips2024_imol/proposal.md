## **1. Title:** Adaptive Contextual Goal Generation for Open-Ended Learning via Hierarchical Intrinsic Motivation

## **2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**

The quest to replicate human-like intelligence in machines necessitates the development of agents capable of autonomous, lifelong learning in complex, ever-changing environments. Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to acquire a vast repertoire of skills and knowledge without constant external supervision, driven by intrinsic factors like curiosity and the desire to master their surroundings (White, 1959; Berlyne, 1960). Inspired by this, the field of Intrinsically Motivated Open-ended Learning (IMOL) has emerged as a promising direction in artificial intelligence (Oudeyer et al., 2007; Barto, 2013). Intrinsic motivations (IMs) provide learning signals generated internally by the agent, allowing them to explore and learn skills even in the absence of predefined tasks or external rewards. This paradigm has fueled significant advances in reinforcement learning (RL), enabling agents to tackle sparse-reward problems and acquire complex behaviors (Bellemare et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2017; Ecoffet et al., 2021; Du et al., 2023).

Despite these successes, current IMOL agents often fall short of true open-ended learning capabilities. A major limitation lies in their goal-generation mechanisms. Many approaches rely on static, pre-defined goal spaces or intrinsic reward formulations that do not adapt to the changing dynamics or characteristics of the environment (Kulkarni et al., 2016; Eysenbach et al., 2019). This rigidity hinders their ability to generalize to novel situations, efficiently balance exploration (seeking novelty) and exploitation (mastering skills) over long time horizons, and sustain learning in truly open-ended worlds where tasks and environmental properties evolve continuously (Colas et al., 2022). As identified in recent analyses (see attached Literature Review), key challenges remain in achieving dynamic goal adaptation, effective long-term exploration/exploitation balance, robust skill retention and transfer, scalable hierarchical learning, and designing effective IM mechanisms. Addressing these challenges is crucial for developing autonomous agents that can thrive outside constrained laboratory settings and adapt flexibly throughout their operational lifetimes.

**2.2 Research Objectives**

This research aims to address the limitations of current IMOL agents by developing a novel hierarchical framework capable of *adaptive contextual goal generation*. The core idea is to empower an agent to autonomously decide *what* it should try to learn next, based on its assessment of the current environmental context and its own learning progress. Our primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Hierarchical Intrinsic Motivation Architecture:** Design and implement a two-level hierarchical RL system, termed ACORN (Adaptive CONtextual goal geneRation Network), comprising a high-level meta-controller for goal generation and a low-level controller for skill execution.
2.  **Implement Context-Aware Goal Generation:** Equip the meta-controller with the ability to analyze relevant environmental statistics (context features) and dynamically generate intrinsic goals that are appropriate for the current context (e.g., prioritizing exploration in novel environments vs. skill refinement in familiar ones). This will leverage meta-reinforcement learning and attention mechanisms.
3.  **Enable Dynamic Exploration-Exploitation Balancing:** Investigate how contextual goal generation can naturally lead to adaptive balancing of exploration and exploitation over the agent's lifetime, driven by environmental cues rather than fixed heuristics.
4.  **Facilitate Lifelong Skill Accumulation and Reuse:** Integrate mechanisms for storing learned low-level skills (policies) in a growing library and enabling the meta-controller to select, adapt, or compose these skills for efficient learning in new situations.
5.  **Empirically Validate the Framework:** Rigorously evaluate the ACORN framework in diverse, procedurally generated, and dynamically changing environments, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art IMOL baselines on metrics assessing task coverage, adaptation speed, skill transfer, and sample efficiency.

**2.3 Significance**

This research holds significant potential for advancing the state-of-the-art in artificial intelligence, particularly in the domain of autonomous lifelong learning.

*   **Scientific Contribution:** By introducing a mechanism for context-dependent intrinsic goal generation, this work directly tackles a fundamental limitation in current IMOL research â€“ the static nature of goal-setting. Success would provide a more plausible computational model of how organisms might adapt their exploratory drives based on environmental affordances and challenges, contributing insights relevant to developmental psychology and cognitive science. It addresses several key challenges identified in the literature, including dynamic goal adaptation and exploration/exploitation balancing.
*   **Technological Advancement:** The proposed ACORN framework could lead to AI agents that are significantly more robust, adaptable, and autonomous when deployed in real-world, unpredictable environments. This has implications for long-term robotics applications (e.g., exploration rovers, persistent environmental monitoring, household assistants), personalized education systems, and AI agents operating in complex simulations or games where conditions change over time.
*   **Bridging the Gap:** This research aims to bridge the gap between curiosity-driven exploration, often demonstrated in constrained settings, and the practical need for agents that can acquire and deploy useful skills reliably in dynamic scenarios without constant human oversight or reward engineering. It moves towards fulfilling the long-term objective of open-ended learning machines as envisioned by the IMOL community.

## **3. Methodology**

**3.1 Research Design: The ACORN Framework**

We propose the Adaptive CONtextual goal geneRation Network (ACORN), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework designed for adaptive, open-ended learning. ACORN consists of two main components: a low-level controller responsible for skill acquisition and execution, and a high-level meta-controller responsible for context analysis and goal generation.

**3.1.1 Low-Level Controller: Skill Acquisition**

*   **Function:** Learns policies to achieve specific goals set by the meta-controller.
*   **Architecture:** A deep neural network, potentially a standard Actor-Critic architecture (e.g., using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms). The policy network $\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t, g_t)$ takes the current state $s_t \in \mathcal{S}$ and the current goal $g_t \in \mathcal{G}$ (provided by the meta-controller) as input and outputs an action $a_t \in \mathcal{A}$. The value network $V_\psi(s_t, g_t)$ or Q-network $Q_\psi(s_t, a_t, g_t)$ estimates the expected return for achieving the goal.
*   **Goal Representation:** Goals $g_t$ can be represented in various ways depending on the task, such as desired future states, target configurations of objects, specific skill indices (if skills are categorical), or latent embeddings learned to represent achievable outcomes (similar to Sukhbaatar et al., 2018). We will initially focus on goal representations as desired states or state distributions within the environment's state space.
*   **Intrinsic Motivation:** The low-level controller is trained using an intrinsic reward $r^{int}_t$. This reward encourages exploration and skill acquisition related to the goal $g_t$. We will primarily investigate using **Random Network Distillation (RND)** (Burda et al., 2019) as the source of intrinsic reward, where the reward is proportional to the prediction error of a randomly initialized, fixed target network on the next state $s_{t+1}$:
    $$r^{int}_t = || f_{pred}(s_{t+1}; \omega) - f_{target}(s_{t+1}) ||^2$$
    Here, $f_{target}$ is the fixed random target network and $f_{pred}$ is a predictor network trained on states visited by the agent, with parameters $\omega$. This encourages visiting novel states. Alternatively, we may explore competence-based rewards (e.g., increase in prediction accuracy or success rate for goal $g_t$) or information-theoretic rewards (e.g., information gain). Crucially, the reward mechanism itself is standard; the novelty lies in *how* the goals $g_t$ guiding this mechanism are selected.
*   **Training:** The low-level policy parameters $\theta$ and value function parameters $\psi$ are updated using standard RL algorithms based on the intrinsic reward $r^{int}_t$ accumulated while attempting to achieve $g_t$. Training occurs over finite horizons (e.g., $H$ steps) determined by the meta-controller.

**3.1.2 High-Level Meta-Controller: Contextual Goal Generation**

*   **Function:** Operates at a slower timescale, observing environmental context and learning progress to generate appropriate goals $g_t$ for the low-level controller.
*   **Context Feature Extraction:** At each meta-step (e.g., every $H$ low-level steps), the meta-controller computes a set of context features $\mathcal{C}_t$. These features aim to capture relevant properties of the environment and the agent's interaction with it. Examples include:
    *   *Sensor Statistics:* Mean, variance, or dimensionality of recent sensor readings (e.g., high variance might indicate a dynamic or complex visual scene).
    *   *Dynamics Predictability:* Error rate or uncertainty estimates from an auxiliary world model trained on recent experience (e.g., high prediction error suggests novel or chaotic dynamics).
    *   *Novelty Metrics:* Density estimates of recently visited states or average RND rewards in the local region (high RND suggests unexplored areas).
    *   *Task Complexity Heuristics:* Number of interactable objects detected, estimated entropy of the state space locally.
    *   *Agent's Competence:* Success rates or learning progress on previously attempted goals.
*   **Goal Generation Architecture:** The meta-controller policy $\Pi_\phi(g_t | \mathcal{H}_t, \mathcal{C}_t)$ maps the agent's history $\mathcal{H}_t$ (potentially summarized by an RNN or Transformer) and the current context features $\mathcal{C}_t$ to a new goal $g_t$. We propose using an **attention mechanism** to allow the policy to dynamically weigh the importance of different context features:
    $$ \text{Context Embedding } e_t = \text{Attention}(\text{Query}=h_t, \text{Keys}=\mathcal{C}_t, \text{Values}=\mathcal{C}_t) $$
    where $h_t$ is the hidden state of the recurrent network summarizing history. The resulting context embedding $e_t$ is concatenated with $h_t$ and fed into a policy network (e.g., Actor-Critic) that outputs the goal $g_t$. The goal space $\mathcal{G}$ could be continuous (e.g., target coordinates) or discrete (e.g., selecting a skill/sub-task).
*   **Meta-Reinforcement Learning:** The meta-controller parameters $\phi$ are trained using meta-RL. The meta-objective is to learn a goal-generation strategy that maximizes long-term learning progress or coverage of the environment's possibilities. The meta-reward $R^{meta}_t$ can be defined in several ways:
    *   *Learning Progress:* Sum of low-level intrinsic rewards obtained during the execution of goal $g_t$: $R^{meta}_t = \sum_{k=t}^{t+H-1} r^{int}_k$. This directly encourages generating goals that lead to high novelty or competence gain.
    *   *State Space Coverage:* Increase in the entropy of visited states or achieved goals over a longer period.
    *   *Skill Discovery:* Rewards for successfully achieving diverse types of goals or adding new, distinct skills to the library.
    We will primarily use the cumulative intrinsic reward as the meta-reward signal, as it directly aligns with the low-level learning driver. The meta-RL algorithm could be PPO or SAC adapted for the meta-level optimization.

**3.1.3 Skill Library and Composition**

*   To facilitate lifelong learning, successfully learned low-level policies (parameter sets $\theta_i$ associated with achieving certain goals $g_i$ or types of goals) will be stored in a skill library $\mathcal{L} = \{(\theta_1, g_1), (\theta_2, g_2), ...\}$.
*   When generating a goal $g_t$, the meta-controller can potentially leverage the library in several ways:
    *   *Goal Selection:* Select a goal $g_i$ corresponding to an existing skill $\theta_i$ for refinement or practice (exploitation).
    *   *Skill Initialization:* When generating a novel goal $g_{new}$, initialize the low-level policy $\theta_{new}$ using parameters from a similar skill $\theta_j \in \mathcal{L}$ (few-shot transfer). Similarity could be based on goal representation distance.
    *   *Goal Composition (Advanced):* Generate goals that require sequencing or blending existing skills. This is a more complex extension for future work.
*   The library management (adding new skills, pruning redundant ones) will be based on heuristics like achieving a certain performance threshold on a goal or demonstrating novelty/utility compared to existing skills.

**3.2 Experimental Design**

*   **Environments:** We will use a suite of environments with increasing complexity and dynamic properties:
    1.  *Dynamic MiniGrid:* 2D grid worlds with procedurally generated layouts, objects, and potentially changing dynamics (e.g., doors locking/unlocking, new areas becoming accessible) over the agent's lifetime.
    2.  *ProcGen Benchmark (modified):* Utilize environments like Maze, CoinRun from ProcGen (Cobbe et al., 2020), potentially modifying them to introduce non-stationarity or phases with different objectives (e.g., exploration phase followed by exploitation phase).
    3.  *3D Manipulation/Navigation:* Environments built using simulators like PyBullet or MuJoCo (e.g., fetching objects, navigating complex terrains). We will design scenarios where the available objects, their properties, or the layout change over long interaction periods, requiring adaptation. For example, starting in an empty room, then objects appear, then tools are introduced.
*   **Baselines:** We will compare ACORN against several strong baselines:
    1.  *Flat IM Agent:* A non-hierarchical agent using the same intrinsic motivation (e.g., RND) applied globally without explicit goals (e.g., standard RND agent).
    2.  *Hierarchical RL with Static Goals (HRL-Static):* An agent using a predefined, fixed set of goals (e.g., grid over state space, fixed object targets) and a standard HRL approach like h-DQN (Kulkarni et al., 2016) or feudal networks, using the same low-level IM reward.
    3.  *Hierarchical RL with Random Goals (HRL-Random):* A hierarchical agent where the meta-controller selects goals randomly from the goal space $\mathcal{G}$ at each meta-step.
    4.  *Goal-GAN (Florensa et al., 2018) or similar:* A representative method for generating goals based on achievability/difficulty, but without explicit context adaptation.
    5.  *ACORN Ablations:* Versions of ACORN without the context analysis module (using only history), without the attention mechanism, or using different meta-reward formulations.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Performance will be evaluated based on:
    *   *Task Coverage & Diversity:* Number of unique environment states visited, entropy of the distribution of achieved goals (if goals are quantifiable), number of distinct objects interacted with or regions explored. Measured throughout the lifetime.
    *   *Adaptation Speed:* Performance (e.g., task success rate if applicable, rate of intrinsic reward gain) improvement rate immediately following a significant change in the environment (e.g., introduction of new objects, change in dynamics).
    *   *Skill Reusability & Transfer:* Evaluate zero-shot or few-shot performance on downstream tasks introduced *after* the main open-ended learning phase, requiring skills learned during that phase. Compare the sample efficiency of fine-tuning ACORN vs. baselines on these new tasks.
    *   *Sample Efficiency:* Total number of environment steps required to reach certain milestones in coverage or competence across the environment.
    *   *Qualitative Analysis:* Visualize goal sequences generated by ACORN in different contexts (e.g., novel vs. familiar settings) to understand the adaptive behavior.

**3.3 Implementation Details**

*   We will primarily use Python with standard ML libraries (PyTorch/TensorFlow, NumPy) and RL libraries (Stable Baselines3, RLLib, or custom implementations).
*   Environments will be interfaces using OpenAI Gym(nasium) standards.
*   Computational resources will involve multi-GPU servers for training deep RL agents. Hyperparameter tuning will be performed using systematic search methods (e.g., grid search, Bayesian optimization) on a smaller scale before full runs. Code will be made publicly available.

## **4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**

1.  **A Novel Adaptive HRL Framework (ACORN):** We expect to successfully implement the ACORN architecture, demonstrating its capacity for modulating goal generation based on environmental context features.
2.  **Demonstration of Contextual Adaptation:** We anticipate empirical results showing that ACORN generates qualitatively different goal sequences in response to changes in environmental novelty, complexity, or dynamics. For instance, generating more exploratory goals (targeting novel states) in new environments and more exploitative goals (refining existing skills or targeting known rewarding states) in familiar environments.
3.  **Superior Performance in Dynamic Environments:** We expect ACORN to outperform baseline methods (Flat IM, HRL-Static, HRL-Random) in environments that change over time, particularly on metrics related to adaptation speed, long-term task coverage, and skill transferability. The contextual awareness should allow ACORN to avoid getting stuck in non-productive exploration loops or failing to adapt when conditions shift.
4.  **Efficient Skill Accumulation and Reuse:** The skill library mechanism within ACORN is expected to demonstrably improve sample efficiency when encountering situations requiring previously learned skills, compared to learning from scratch or less structured HRL approaches. We predict faster convergence on downstream tasks.
5.  **Insights into IMOL Design:** The research will provide valuable insights into the interplay between context perception, intrinsic motivation, goal setting, and hierarchical control in fostering open-ended learning. Ablation studies will clarify the specific contributions of context analysis and attention mechanisms.

**4.2 Impact**

*   **Advancing IMOL Research:** This work will provide a concrete computational framework addressing the critical challenge of dynamic goal adaptation in IMOL. It offers a path towards agents that can genuinely learn and adapt over extended periods in non-stationary worlds, pushing the boundaries of autonomous learning. It directly addresses several key challenges outlined in the literature review provided.
*   **Enabling More Autonomous AI Systems:** By reducing the reliance on fixed goal spaces or reward functions, ACORN contributes to the development of AI agents that require less manual engineering and can operate more autonomously in complex, real-world scenarios. This is particularly relevant for robotics, where agents must cope with unforeseen situations and continuously expand their capabilities.
*   **Informing Cognitive Science:** The mechanisms explored in ACORN, particularly the context-dependent modulation of exploratory drives, may offer testable hypotheses and a modeling framework relevant to understanding goal selection, curiosity, and developmental learning trajectories in humans and animals.
*   **Broader AI Applications:** The principles of adaptive goal generation and hierarchical control are broadly applicable. Success could influence the design of recommender systems (adapting recommendations based on user context), dialogue systems (adapting conversational goals), and other areas where intelligent adaptation to context is key.

In summary, this research proposes a significant step towards realizing the vision of truly autonomous, intrinsically motivated, and open-ended learning agents. By enabling agents to adapt their learning Gs based on their understanding of the environment, we aim to create machines capable of sustained, flexible skill acquisition in the complex, dynamic world they inhabit.
