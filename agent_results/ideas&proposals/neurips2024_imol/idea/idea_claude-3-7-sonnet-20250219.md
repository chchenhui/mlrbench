# Generative Goal-Space Evolution for Intrinsically Motivated Learning Agents

## Motivation
Current intrinsically motivated learning systems lack the flexibility to autonomously generate and evolve their own goal spaces, limiting their ability to adapt to novel environments. Most systems rely on pre-engineered goal spaces or learning objectives, fundamentally constraining their capacity for open-ended learning. This represents a critical gap in the development of truly autonomous agents capable of lifelong learning across diverse, unpredictable environments.

## Main Idea
I propose a framework where agents dynamically generate and evolve their own goal spaces through a meta-learning approach. The system incorporates three key components: (1) A generative goal model that synthesizes potential goals based on the agent's current knowledge state and environment interactions; (2) An adaptive selection mechanism that evaluates generated goals using multi-criteria assessment (learning progress, novelty, achievability, and future utility); and (3) A goal space evolution module that periodically restructures the goal space through merging, splitting, or abstracting goals based on discovered relationships. 

This approach enables agents to continuously refine their learning objectives in response to environment changes and their own developing capabilities. By allowing the goal space itself to become an emergent property of the learning process rather than a fixed constraint, we can achieve more robust generalization and truly open-ended development in autonomous agents.
