**Title:** Curriculum Co-evolution via Intrinsic Goal Shaping

**Motivation:** While intrinsic motivations drive exploration, achieving truly open-ended learning requires agents to not only explore but also structure their learning effectively over long timescales. Agents need to adaptively set achievable yet challenging goals that build upon previously acquired skills, akin to a self-guided curriculum, a capability currently lacking.

**Main Idea:** Propose a framework where an agent's intrinsic motivation mechanism and its goal generation process co-evolve. The agent generates potential goals using a generative model. Concurrently, an intrinsic motivation module, based on learning progress or competence gain on these goals, provides feedback. This feedback adjusts both the agent's policy for achieving goals *and* the parameters of the goal generator itself. Goals leading to high, sustained learning progress are reinforced, biasing the generator towards similar, incrementally more complex goals. This creates a dynamic, self-organizing curriculum tailored to the agent's current capabilities, fostering efficient skill acquisition and enabling more structured, truly open-ended development.
