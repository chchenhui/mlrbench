**Title: Semantic Conformal Prediction Sets for Reliable Uncertainty Quantification in Black-Box Large Language Models**

**1. Introduction**

*   **Background:** Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and Llama have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language tasks, revolutionizing fields from content creation to scientific discovery. However, their deployment in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal advice is hampered by significant reliability concerns. LLMs often exhibit overconfidence, generating fluent but factually incorrect or "hallucinated" responses [Key Challenge 1]. Furthermore, standard uncertainty metrics derived from model internals (e.g., token probabilities) are often inaccessible for black-box models served via APIs and may not reliably correlate with semantic correctness [5, 6]. This necessitates new statistical tools specifically designed for the black-box setting, ensuring safety and trustworthiness [Task Description].

*   **Problem Statement:** Traditional statistical methods often rely on strong distributional assumptions or access to model internals, neither of which holds for proprietary, black-box LLMs. While recent progress has been made in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for LLMs [5], robust, distribution-free guarantees are largely missing, particularly for open-ended generative tasks. Conformal Prediction (CP) offers a promising framework for providing statistically rigorous, finite-sample coverage guarantees without relying on distributional assumptions or model internals [e.g., Vovk et al., 2005]. Recent works have begun exploring CP for LLMs, focusing on aspects like multiple-choice QA [2], calibrating generation processes [3], ensuring factuality [4], or using self-consistency [1]. However, effectively applying CP to guarantee *semantic* correctness for diverse outputs from black-box generative LLMs remains a challenge [Key Challenge 2]. Existing methods may not adequately capture the nuanced meaning of generated text or provide practical prediction sets conveying meaningful uncertainty to users. There is a critical need for a CP framework that leverages semantic understanding to produce calibrated sets of candidate responses, directly addressing the risk of semantic errors and hallucinations in black-box models.

*   **Research Objectives:** This research aims to develop and validate a novel framework, Semantic Conformal Prediction (SCP), tailored for black-box LLMs. The primary objectives are:
    1.  To design a CP methodology that utilizes semantic embeddings to define nonconformity, capturing the semantic distance between generated responses and reference outputs.
    2.  To develop an algorithm that constructs prediction sets of candidate responses for any given prompt, such that the true (ideal) response is contained within the set with a user-specified probability (e.g., $1-\alpha$).
    3.  To implement this SCP framework, wrapping around existing black-box LLM APIs and state-of-the-art sentence embedding models.
    4.  To empirically validate the framework's performance across diverse datasets and LLMs, specifically evaluating the calibration of coverage guarantees, the efficiency (size) of prediction sets, and the quality of generated candidates within the sets.
    5.  To investigate the framework's sensitivity to key hyperparameters, such as the choice of embedding model, calibration dataset size, and desired coverage level $\alpha$.

*   **Significance:** This research directly addresses the critical need for trustworthy AI by providing statistically sound uncertainty quantification for black-box LLMs. By generating calibrated *semantic* prediction sets, the proposed SCP framework offers a practical tool to mitigate risks associated with overconfidence and hallucinations, enhancing LLM safety [10]. Successful development and validation will enable more responsible deployment of LLMs in high-stakes applications where reliability is paramount [8]. Furthermore, this work contributes to the statistical foundations of modern large-scale models, offering new techniques for auditing, risk analysis, and ensuring safe AI operation in the black-box era. The framework's ability to work with any API-based LLM makes it broadly applicable and immediately useful for practitioners.

**2. Methodology**

This section details the proposed Semantic Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework, including data requirements, algorithmic steps, mathematical formulation, and the experimental design for validation.

*   **Core Idea:** The central idea is to leverage semantic similarity in an embedding space to define nonconformity within a conformal prediction framework. We hypothesize that the semantic distance between an LLM's generated response and the (unknown) ideal response can be related to observable quantities, such as the semantic consistency among multiple candidate responses generated for the same prompt. We use a calibration set of (prompt, reference output) pairs to determine a threshold based on semantic dissimilarity scores. This threshold is then used at prediction time to construct a set of candidate responses likely to contain a semantically correct answer with probability $1-\alpha$.

*   **Data Collection and Preparation:**
    *   **Calibration Set:** We require a calibration dataset $D_{cal} = \{ (p_i, y_i) \}_{i=1}^n$, where $p_i$ is a prompt and $y_i$ is a corresponding high-quality, reference output (ground truth). The size $n$ should be sufficient for stable quantile estimation (e.g., hundreds to thousands of examples). These pairs should ideally be representative of the target domain(s) of application. Potential sources include high-quality question-answering datasets (e.g., Natural Questions, TriviaQA), instruction-following datasets, or domain-specific data (e.g., curated medical questions and answers, legal case summaries).
    *   **Test Set:** An independent test set $D_{test} = \{ (p_j, y_j) \}_{j=1}^m$ of the same format will be used for evaluating the performance of the method. It is crucial that $D_{test}$ is drawn from the same underlying distribution as $D_{cal}$ for the CP guarantees to hold formally (exchangeability assumption).

*   **Algorithmic Steps:** The SCP framework consists of a calibration phase and a prediction phase.

    *   **Phase 1: Calibration**
        1.  **Select Models:** Choose the black-box LLM $L(\cdot)$ to be calibrated (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo, Claude-3-Opus via API) and a sentence embedding model $E(\cdot)$ (e.g., models from the Sentence-BERT family like `all-mpnet-base-v2`, or newer models like `text-embedding-3-large`).
        2.  **Generate Candidates & Compute Nonconformity Scores:** For each calibration pair $(p_i, y_i) \in D_{cal}$:
            a.  Generate a set of $k$ candidate responses $C_i = \{c_{i1}, ..., c_{ik}\}$ by querying the LLM $L(p_i)$ multiple times (e.g., using nucleus sampling with non-zero temperature).
            b.  Embed the reference output $e_{y_i} = E(y_i)$ and all candidates $e_{c_{ij}} = E(c_{ij})$.
            c.  Define a nonconformity score $s_i$ that measures the semantic discrepancy between the generated candidates $C_i$ and the reference $y_i$. A potential score is the minimum cosine distance between the reference embedding and any candidate embedding:
                $$ s_i = \min_{j=1,...,k} d(e_{c_{ij}}, e_{y_i}) $$
                where $d(u, v)$ is a distance metric, typically cosine distance:
                $$ d(u, v) = 1 - \frac{u \cdot v}{\|u\| \|v\|} $$
                This score $s_i$ is low if at least one generated candidate is semantically close to the true answer, and high otherwise.
        3.  **Determine Conformal Threshold:** Compute the threshold $\tau$ as the $\lceil (n+1)(1-\alpha) \rceil / n$ quantile of the observed nonconformity scores $\{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\}$. Let this quantile be $\hat{q}_{1-\alpha}$. Set $\tau = \hat{q}_{1-\alpha}$. This threshold $\tau$ provides the critical value for constructing prediction sets.

    *   **Phase 2: Prediction**
        1.  **Receive New Prompt:** Given a new prompt $p_{new}$.
        2.  **Generate Candidate Set:** Generate $k$ candidate responses $C_{new} = \{c_1, ..., c_k\}$ using the same LLM $L(p_{new})$ and generation strategy as in the calibration phase.
        3.  **Embed Candidates:** Compute embeddings $e_{c_j} = E(c_j)$ for all $j=1,...,k$.
        4.  **Compute Proxy Scores:** For each candidate $c_j$, compute a proxy score $\hat{s}_j$ that estimates its likely nonconformity *without access to the unknown true answer $y_{new}$*. This is a crucial step where we bridge the calibration (using $y_i$) and prediction (without $y_{new}$). We propose using a score based on *semantic self-consistency* among the candidates [inspired by 1, 7, 10]. A candidate that is semantically close to many other candidates generated for the same prompt is assumed to be more likely correct (lower nonconformity).
            a.  Calculate pairwise distances $d_{jl} = d(e_{c_j}, e_{c_l})$ for $l=1,...,k$.
            b.  Compute the proxy score $\hat{s}_j$ for candidate $c_j$ based on its proximity to other candidates. For example, the average distance to its $N$ nearest neighbors in the embedding space within $C_{new}$, or simply its average distance to all other candidates:
                $$ \hat{s}_j = \frac{1}{k-1} \sum_{l \ne j} d(e_{c_j}, e_{c_l}) $$
                Alternatively, clustering (e.g., DBSCAN) could be applied to $E(C_{new})$, and $\hat{s}_j$ could reflect whether $c_j$ belongs to the largest cluster (low score) or is an outlier (high score).
        5.  **Construct Prediction Set:** Form the prediction set $S_{new}$ by including all candidates whose proxy nonconformity score $\hat{s}_j$ is below the calibrated threshold $\tau$:
            $$ S_{new} = \{ c_j \in C_{new} \mid \hat{s}_j \le \tau \} $$


*   **Theoretical Justification (Heuristic Link):** Standard conformal prediction guarantees $P(s_{n+1} \le \tau) \ge 1-\alpha$, where $s_{n+1}$ uses the true (unknown) $y_{n+1}$. Our construction $S_{new} = \{ c_j \mid \hat{s}_j \le \tau \}$ relies on the heuristic assumption that the proxy score $\hat{s}_j$ (based on self-consistency) serves as a reasonable surrogate for the true nonconformity score $s_j = d(E(c_j), E(y_{new}))$. That is, we assume candidates that are semantically consistent with other candidates are more likely to be semantically close to the true answer. The validity of this assumption directly impacts the empirical coverage achieved by $S_{new}$. The theoretical guarantee $P(y_{new} \in S_{new}^{\text{ideal}}) \ge 1-\alpha$ holds for the *ideal* set $S_{new}^{\text{ideal}} = \{ c \mid d(E(c), E(y_{new})) \le \tau \}$. Our goal is for our constructed set $S_{new}$ to effectively approximate this ideal set, containing $y_{new}$ (or a semantically equivalent response) with the desired frequency. The empirical validation is therefore crucial.

*   **Experimental Design:**
    *   **LLMs:** We will test the framework on several widely-used black-box LLMs accessible via APIs, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude family (e.g., Claude-3-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus), and potentially others like Google's Gemini Pro.
    *   **Embedding Models:** We will evaluate different sentence embedding models, ranging from established models like `all-mpnet-base-v2` to potentially larger or more recent ones (e.g., OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large`, Cohere's embed models), to assess the impact of embedding quality on performance [7].
    *   **Datasets:** We will use established datasets suitable for evaluating generative tasks where semantic correctness is key. Examples include:
        *   Question Answering: Natural Questions, TriviaQA, WebQuestions. Subsets will be used for calibration and testing.
        *   Instruction Following: Potentially subsets of Alpaca or similar datasets, filtered for tasks where semantic evaluation is feasible.
        *   Domain-Specific (optional): If resources permit, testing on a specialized dataset like MedQA (medical) or a legal QA dataset to evaluate high-stakes domain performance.
    *   **Baselines:**
        *   **Top-1 Output:** The standard LLM output (highest probability or first generated). No uncertainty estimate.
        *   **LLM Confidence (if available):** If the API provides any confidence score (e.g., logprobs, though often not available for black-box), compare its correlation with correctness versus our SCP approach.
        *   **Vanilla CP (if adaptable):** A simpler CP approach, perhaps based on token probabilities if available (though violates black-box assumption) or a non-semantic nonconformity score, to highlight the benefit of semantic information.
        *   **Related CP Methods:** Conceptually compare with methods like ConU [1] or Conformal Language Modeling [3], discussing differences in applicability (black-box vs. white-box) or nonconformity definitions.
    *   **Evaluation Metrics:**
        1.  **Empirical Coverage Rate:** The fraction of test prompts $p_j$ for which the generated prediction set $S_j$ contains a semantically correct answer. A response $c \in S_j$ is considered semantically correct if its embedding $E(c)$ is sufficiently close to the reference embedding $E(y_j)$ (e.g., $d(E(c), E(y_j)) \le \delta$ for a small threshold $\delta$, or assessed via human evaluation on a subset). This empirical rate should be close to the nominal rate $1-\alpha$.
        2.  **Average Set Size:** The average number of candidates $|S_j|$ in the prediction sets over the test set. Smaller sets are preferred for efficiency, given that coverage is met. We will report the distribution of set sizes.
        3.  **Set Quality / Oracle Accuracy:** The proportion of non-empty sets $S_j$ that contain at least one semantically correct answer.
        4.  **Semantic Similarity within Set:** For non-empty sets, measure the maximum semantic similarity (cosine similarity) between any candidate in the set $S_j$ and the reference $y_j$.
        5.  **Computational Cost:** Measure the overhead introduced by the SCP framework (embedding computation, scoring, candidate generation).
    *   **Ablation Studies:**
        *   Effect of calibration set size $n$.
        *   Effect of the number of candidates $k$ generated per prompt.
        *   Impact of the choice of embedding model $E(\cdot)$.
        *   Performance across different target coverage levels $1-\alpha$.
        *   Comparison of different proxy score $\hat{s}_j$ definitions (e.g., average distance vs. clustering-based).

**3. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

*   **Expected Outcomes:**
    1.  **A Validated SCP Framework:** A well-documented methodology and potentially open-source code implementing the Semantic Conformal Prediction framework for black-box LLMs.
    2.  **Empirical Results:** Quantitative results demonstrating the framework's performance on benchmark datasets. We expect to show that the empirical coverage rate closely matches the desired $1-\alpha$ level across different settings. We anticipate that the prediction sets will be informative (often containing more than one plausible answer when uncertainty is high, and ideally converging to a single correct answer when confidence is high) and significantly smaller than naive approaches (e.g., returning all top-k candidates).
    3.  **Comparative Analysis:** Clear comparisons against baseline methods, highlighting the advantages of the SCP approach in terms of providing reliable, semantically-grounded uncertainty quantification.
    4.  **Insights into Parameter Sensitivity:** Understanding how factors like embedding model choice, calibration data size ($n$), number of candidates ($k$), and proxy score definition influence coverage, set size, and computational overhead. This will provide practical guidance for deploying the framework.
    5.  **Demonstration of Reduced Hallucinations:** Evidence suggesting that filtering candidates based on the conformal threshold $\tau$ effectively removes low-quality or hallucinated responses that are semantically inconsistent with more plausible outputs.

*   **Potential Challenges & Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Validity of Proxy Score:** The core challenge lies in the heuristic link between the self-consistency proxy score $\hat{s}_j$ and the true nonconformity $s_j$. [Key Challenge 3] If the assumption fails, empirical coverage may deviate from $1-\alpha$.
        *   *Mitigation:* We will rigorously test empirical coverage across diverse datasets and $\alpha$ levels. We will explore alternative proxy scores $\hat{s}_j$ (e.g., based on embedding density, clustering properties) and evaluate their effectiveness. If coverage is systematically under or over the target, methods for recalibrating the threshold or refining the proxy score might be investigated.
    *   **Computational Cost:** Generating $k$ candidates and embedding them can be computationally expensive and increase API costs. [Key Challenge 4]
        *   *Mitigation:* We will investigate the trade-off between the number of candidates $k$, performance (coverage/set size), and cost. We will explore efficient embedding models and potentially techniques to reuse computations. The framework is inherently parallelizable across calibration/test instances.
    *   **Quality of Reference Outputs:** The quality of the calibration set $D_{cal}$ (specifically the reference $y_i$) is crucial for learning a meaningful threshold $\tau$. Noisy or low-quality references could degrade performance.
        *   *Mitigation:* Use established, high-quality benchmarks. Careful data cleaning and potentially filtering of calibration examples might be necessary. Sensitivity analysis regarding reference quality could be performed.
    *   **Generalization Across Domains:** Ensuring the calibrated threshold $\tau$ generalizes to prompts or domains slightly different from the calibration set. [Key Challenge 5]
        *   *Mitigation:* Evaluate on diverse test sets, including potentially out-of-distribution examples, to understand robustness. Domain-specific calibration might be required for optimal performance in highly specialized areas. Explore adaptive or online conformal prediction techniques as future work if generalization is poor.
    *   **Definition of Semantic Correctness:** Evaluating whether a prediction set "covers" the true answer requires defining semantic equivalence, which can be ambiguous.
        *   *Mitigation:* Primarily use automated metrics based on embedding similarity ($d(E(c), E(y_j)) \le \delta$), acknowledging its limitations. Supplement with qualitative analysis and potentially limited human evaluation for critical assessments.

*   **Impact:** This research will provide a significant advancement in the field of trustworthy AI and LLM evaluation.
    *   **Enhanced Safety and Reliability:** The SCP framework offers a principled way to quantify and manage uncertainty in black-box LLMs, directly contributing to safer deployment in critical applications [Task Description: Auditing, safety, risk analysis]. Users can be presented with a set of plausible options with a guarantee, rather than a single, potentially wrong, answer.
    *   **Improved LLM Auditing:** The method provides a new tool for auditing black-box models, allowing assessment of their reliability based on semantic correctness guarantees.
    *   **Contribution to Statistical Foundations:** It extends the application of conformal prediction to complex, high-dimensional, semantic outputs typical of modern foundation models, contributing new techniques to the intersection of statistics and AI.
    *   **Practical Tooling:** A readily applicable method for developers and practitioners using LLM APIs to improve the reliability of their applications without needing access to model internals.
    *   **Foundation for Future Work:** The framework can be extended, for instance, to handle conditional coverage (guarantees conditioned on prompt complexity), incorporate chain-of-thought reasoning analysis within the sets, or explore more sophisticated nonconformity and proxy scores.

In conclusion, the proposed Semantic Conformal Prediction framework promises a rigorous and practical approach to uncertainty quantification for black-box LLMs, addressing a critical gap in ensuring their safe and reliable deployment. Through careful methodological design and thorough empirical validation, this research aims to deliver a valuable tool for the AI community and contribute significantly to the development of trustworthy AI systems.
