# Semantic Conformal Prediction Sets for Black-Box LLM Uncertainty

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by generating human-like text with remarkable proficiency. However, the black-box nature of these models poses significant challenges, particularly in high-stakes applications where reliability and trustworthiness are paramount. LLMs often produce overconfident or hallucinated outputs, which can lead to critical errors in healthcare, legal advice, and other sensitive domains. Traditional statistical methods, which rely on interpretable models, are insufficient for quantifying uncertainty in black-box models. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new statistical tools that can provide distribution-free uncertainty guarantees for safe deployment of LLMs.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a semantic conformal prediction framework that wraps any LLM API and outputs a calibrated set of candidate responses with guaranteed coverage. The framework will address the following key challenges:
- **Overconfidence and Hallucinations**: Reduce the occurrence of overconfident and hallucinated outputs by providing a set of plausible responses.
- **Lack of Reliable Uncertainty Quantification**: Offer distribution-free uncertainty guarantees to ensure the safe deployment of LLMs in critical applications.
- **Calibration of Nonconformity Scores**: Develop a robust method for defining and calibrating nonconformity scores in semantic embedding spaces.
- **Scalability of Conformal Prediction Methods**: Implement the framework in a computationally efficient manner to handle large-scale LLMs.
- **Generalization Across Domains**: Ensure that the framework generalizes well across various domains and tasks.

### Significance

The proposed semantic conformal prediction framework will significantly enhance the reliability and safety of LLMs in high-stakes applications. By providing finite-sample guarantees on coverage, reducing hallucinations, and extending to chain-of-thought reasoning for richer safety audits, the framework will enable the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in critical domains such as healthcare, legal advice, and autonomous systems.

## 2. Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed methodology involves developing a semantic conformal prediction framework that leverages shared sentence-embedding spaces to quantify uncertainty in LLMs. The framework consists of the following key steps:

1. **Calibration Corpus Collection**: Collect a calibration corpus of (prompt, reference output) pairs.
2. **Embedding Space Construction**: Embed both prompt+LLM-generated candidates and true outputs into a shared sentence-embedding space.
3. **Nonconformity Score Definition**: Define a nonconformity score as the cosine distance between each generated candidate and its reference embedding.
4. **Coverage Guarantee Calculation**: Compute the α-quantile of the nonconformity scores to derive a threshold τ ensuring that with probability 1–α the true answer lies within the generated set whose nonconformity ≤τ.
5. **Candidate Selection**: At test time, given a prompt, sample top-k outputs, compute their scores relative to the calibration distribution, and return only those within τ.

### Data Collection

The calibration corpus will be constructed by collecting a diverse set of (prompt, reference output) pairs. The prompts will cover a wide range of topics and complexities to ensure the robustness of the embedding space. The reference outputs will be obtained from human experts or high-quality LLMs trained on the same dataset.

### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Embedding Construction**:
   - Given a prompt \( p \) and a reference output \( r \), embed both \( p \) and \( r \) into a shared sentence-embedding space using a pre-trained model such as Sentence-BERT (SBERT).
   - Let \( E(p) \) and \( E(r) \) denote the embeddings of the prompt and reference output, respectively.

2. **Nonconformity Score Calculation**:
   - For each generated candidate \( c \) from the LLM, compute its embedding \( E(c) \).
   - Define the nonconformity score \( \Delta(c, r) \) as the cosine distance between \( E(c) \) and \( E(r) \):
     \[
     \Delta(c, r) = 1 - \cos(E(c), E(r))
     \]

3. **Coverage Guarantee Calculation**:
   - Compute the α-quantile of the nonconformity scores \( \Delta(c, r) \) to derive the threshold \( \tau \):
     \[
     \tau = \Delta_{\alpha}(c, r)
     \]
     where \( \Delta_{\alpha}(c, r) \) denotes the α-quantile of the nonconformity scores.

4. **Candidate Selection**:
   - At test time, given a prompt \( p \), sample top-k outputs \( c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k \) from the LLM.
   - Compute the nonconformity scores \( \Delta(c_i, r) \) for each candidate \( c_i \).
   - Return only those candidates \( c_i \) whose nonconformity scores \( \Delta(c_i, r) \leq \tau \).

### Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the semantic conformal prediction framework, we will use the following metrics:

1. **Coverage Rate**: The proportion of true outputs that lie within the generated set with nonconformity ≤τ.
2. **Hallucination Rate**: The proportion of generated candidates that are not within the set of plausible responses.
3. **Computational Efficiency**: The time and memory complexity of the framework, especially for large-scale LLMs.
4. **Generalization**: The framework's performance across different domains and tasks.

2. **Reduced Hallucinations**: A significant reduction in hallucinated outputs, improving the reliability of LLM-generated responses.
3. **Distribution-Free Uncertainty Guarantees**: Finite-sample guarantees on coverage, ensuring the safe deployment of LLMs in high-stakes settings.

5. **Generalization Across Domains**: Demonstration of the framework's applicability across various domains and tasks.

### Impact

The proposed semantic conformal prediction framework will have a substantial impact on the safe and reliable deployment of LLMs in critical applications. By providing distribution-free uncertainty guarantees and reducing hallucinations, the framework will enhance the trustworthiness of LLM-generated outputs.
