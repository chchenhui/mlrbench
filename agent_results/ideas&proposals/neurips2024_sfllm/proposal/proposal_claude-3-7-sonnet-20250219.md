# Semantic Conformal Prediction for Black-Box LLM Uncertainty Quantification: A Distribution-Free Approach to Safety and Reliability

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, from answering complex questions to generating coherent and contextually relevant text. Despite their impressive performance, these models frequently produce overconfident outputs or hallucinate information—generating content that appears plausible but is factually incorrect or entirely fabricated. This phenomenon poses significant risks when deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, legal applications, financial services, or critical decision-making systems where accuracy and reliability are paramount.

The problem is exacerbated by the "black-box" nature of many commercial LLM deployments. Organizations increasingly access these models through API interfaces that provide limited visibility into model internals and often no access to model confidence scores or logits. Even when such confidence measures are available, they tend to be poorly calibrated and unreliable indicators of actual prediction uncertainty. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can we quantify uncertainty and provide statistical guarantees for models we cannot directly inspect or modify?

Traditional statistical approaches to uncertainty quantification typically rely on access to model internals or make distributional assumptions that do not hold for complex neural architectures. As LLMs continue to be deployed in sensitive applications, there is an urgent need for distribution-free uncertainty quantification methods that can operate on black-box models while providing rigorous statistical guarantees.

### Research Objectives

This research proposes Semantic Conformal Prediction (SCP), a novel framework that extends conformal prediction theory to the semantic space of language models. Our approach aims to:

1. Develop a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method for black-box LLMs that provides finite-sample statistical guarantees on the coverage of prediction sets.

2. Construct a semantic embedding-based nonconformity measure that effectively captures the semantic similarity between generated outputs and reference answers.

3. Create a calibration procedure that wraps any LLM API and outputs prediction sets with a user-specified coverage guarantee.

4. Extend the framework to support chain-of-thought reasoning processes to enable more nuanced safety audits.

5. Empirically validate that the proposed method reduces hallucinations and improves the reliability of LLM outputs across diverse domains.

### Significance

The significance of this research is multifaceted:

First, it addresses a critical gap in the safe deployment of LLMs by providing a theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification technique that works with any black-box model. This is especially important as more organizations rely on third-party LLM services with limited transparency.

Second, by offering finite-sample coverage guarantees, our approach enables practitioners to make principled statements about the reliability of model outputs—a prerequisite for deployment in regulated or high-risk environments.

Third, the semantic embedding approach we propose aligns with how humans evaluate textual similarity, making our uncertainty estimates more interpretable and meaningful compared to token-level or likelihood-based approaches.

Finally, our research contributes to the broader goal of developing statistical foundations for the era of foundation models, where traditional statistical tools may no longer apply. By providing robust uncertainty quantification, we enable more responsible AI deployment and facilitate compliance with emerging regulatory frameworks for AI safety and reliability.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Theoretical Foundation: Conformal Prediction

Conformal prediction provides a distribution-free framework for constructing prediction sets with guaranteed coverage properties. Given a significance level $\alpha \in (0,1)$, conformal prediction constructs a prediction set $C(X)$ for a test input $X$ such that:

$$P(Y \in C(X)) \geq 1-\alpha$$

where $Y$ is the true output. This guarantee holds under the exchangeability assumption without requiring knowledge of the underlying distribution.

Our approach adapts conformal prediction to the LLM setting through the following steps:

### 2.2 Semantic Conformal Prediction Framework

#### 2.2.1 Data Requirements and Collection

The framework requires:

1. A calibration dataset $\mathcal{D}_{\text{cal}} = \{(X_i, Y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ consisting of input prompts $X_i$ and reference outputs $Y_i$.
2. Access to a black-box LLM $f$ that generates candidate responses.
3. A sentence embedding model $g$ that maps text to a dense vector representation.

The calibration dataset should be representative of the target application domain. For general-purpose applications, we recommend using a diverse set of prompts covering multiple domains. For specialized applications (e.g., medical question answering), domain-specific calibration data should be used.

#### 2.2.2 Nonconformity Score

We define the nonconformity score $s(X, Y)$ as the semantic distance between a generated output and the reference answer in the embedding space:

$$s(X, Y) = 1 - \cos(g(Y), g(Y_{\text{ref}}))$$

where $\cos(\cdot, \cdot)$ denotes the cosine similarity, $g(Y)$ is the embedding of a candidate output, and $g(Y_{\text{ref}})$ is the embedding of the reference answer. The score ranges from 0 to 2, with lower values indicating higher similarity.

#### 2.2.3 Calibration Procedure

1. For each prompt $X_i$ in the calibration set:
   a. Generate $k$ candidate responses $\{Y_{i,1}, Y_{i,2}, ..., Y_{i,k}\}$ from the LLM $f$.
   b. Compute embeddings $g(Y_{i,j})$ for each candidate and $g(Y_i)$ for the reference answer.
   c. Calculate nonconformity scores $s_{i,j} = 1 - \cos(g(Y_{i,j}), g(Y_i))$ for each candidate.

2. Compute the calibration threshold $\tau_{\alpha}$ as the $(1-\alpha)(1+1/n)$-quantile of the set of smallest nonconformity scores:
   
   $$S_{\text{cal}} = \{\min_{j} s_{i,j} : i \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}\}$$
   
   $$\tau_{\alpha} = \text{Quantile}(S_{\text{cal}}, (1-\alpha)(1+1/n))$$

The $(1+1/n)$ factor provides a correction to account for the finite calibration set size and ensures the desired coverage guarantee.

#### 2.2.4 Prediction Set Construction

For a new test prompt $X_{\text{test}}$:

1. Generate $k$ candidate responses $\{Y_{\text{test},1}, Y_{\text{test},2}, ..., Y_{\text{test},k}\}$ from the LLM $f$.
2. Compute embeddings for each candidate using the sentence embedding model $g$.
3. For each candidate pair $(Y_{\text{test},i}, Y_{\text{test},j})$, compute the pairwise similarity matrix:
   
   $$S_{i,j} = \cos(g(Y_{\text{test},i}), g(Y_{\text{test},j}))$$

4. Apply clustering to identify distinct response clusters based on semantic similarity.
5. For each cluster, select the representative candidate with the highest average similarity to other members.
6. Construct the conformal prediction set by including all representative candidates whose nonconformity score (estimated using the calibration distribution) is less than or equal to $\tau_{\alpha}$:
   
   $$C(X_{\text{test}}) = \{Y_{\text{test},i} : s(X_{\text{test}}, Y_{\text{test},i}) \leq \tau_{\alpha}\}$$

### 2.3 Extension to Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

We extend our framework to support chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning by:

1. Generating multiple reasoning chains for each prompt using a CoT prompt template:
   
   $$Y_{\text{CoT}} = f(X_{\text{CoT}})$$
   
   where $X_{\text{CoT}}$ is the original prompt augmented with a request for step-by-step reasoning.

2. Decomposing each reasoning chain into individual steps: $Y_{\text{CoT}} = [Y_{\text{step},1}, Y_{\text{step},2}, ..., Y_{\text{step},m}]$.

3. Computing separate nonconformity scores for each reasoning step and the final answer.

4. Applying conformal prediction at both the step level and the final answer level, creating nested prediction sets.

This extension allows for more fine-grained uncertainty quantification and can identify specific reasoning steps that contribute to uncertainty in the final answer.

### 2.4 Experimental Design

2. Sample-based uncertainty estimation (entropy of sampled outputs)
3. LLM self-assessment (asking the model to rate its confidence)
4. Ensemble-based uncertainty quantification
5. Direct use of model-reported confidence scores (where available)

#### 2.4.5 Ablation Studies

We will conduct ablation studies to evaluate:

1. The impact of different embedding models for computing semantic similarity
2. The effect of calibration set size on coverage guarantees
3. The trade-off between the number of generated candidates and prediction set quality
