1. Title  
Semantic Conformal Prediction Sets for Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification in Black-Box Large Language Models  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, achieving human-level performance across tasks such as question answering, summarization, code generation, and dialogue. Despite their empirical success, LLMs frequently exhibit overconfident predictions and generate hallucinatory content when prompt inputs diverge from their training distribution. In high-stakes applications—healthcare advice, legal consultation, or automated decision support—such failures can have severe consequences. Traditional uncertainty quantification for probabilistic models relies on internal likelihoods or calibration techniques, but LLMs deployed as black boxes (e.g., via closed APIs) expose only top-k outputs and often mislead with untrustworthy confidence scores.  

Conformal prediction offers a distribution-free framework for constructing prediction sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees. Classic conformal methods presuppose access to model scores or underlying probability estimates, which limits their applicability to black-box LLMs. Recent works (e.g., ConU, Conformal Language Modeling, Conformal Factuality) begin to bridge this gap, but they rely on task-specific nonconformity measures or sampling heuristics that may not generalize across domains. A promising direction is to leverage semantic embedding spaces—pretrained, task-agnostic encoders that map text into a continuous vector space—to measure nonconformity between model outputs and references.  

Research Objectives  
We propose Semantic Conformal Prediction Sets (SCPS), a general framework that wraps any black-box LLM API and returns a calibrated set of candidate responses with provable coverage $1-\alpha$. Our specific objectives are:  
  • Define a task-agnostic nonconformity score using semantic embeddings and cosine (or Euclidean) distance.  
  • Develop a calibration protocol to estimate the $(1-\alpha)$-quantile threshold from a reference calibration corpus.  
  • Design an efficient prediction algorithm that filters sampled top-k outputs to satisfy the conformal guarantee.  
  • Empirically validate SCPS on diverse generation tasks (open-ended text generation, multi-choice QA, summarization) and compare against state-of-the-art baselines.  

Significance  
SCPS will be the first fully black-box, distribution-free uncertainty method for LLMs that exploits semantic similarity without requiring access to internal scoring. Finite-sample coverage guarantees enhance trustworthiness in critical settings, and the framework is extensible to chain-of-thought reasoning and other structured outputs. By reducing hallucinations and flagging low-confidence cases, SCPS pushes LLMs toward safe, reliable deployment in healthcare, law, finance, and education.  

3. Methodology  

3.1 Overview  
Given a prompt $x\in\mathcal X$, we wish to return a set $\mathcal C(x)\subseteq\mathcal Y$ of candidate responses such that, for a target miscoverage rate $\alpha\in(0,1)$,  
$$
\Pr_{(X,Y)\sim P}\bigl(Y\in \mathcal C(X)\bigr)\;\ge\;1-\alpha\,.
$$  
We assume black-box access to an LLM that, for any $x$, can generate $K$ independent samples $\{\hat y^k(x)\}_{k=1}^K$. We also assume access to a pretrained text embedding model $\phi:\mathcal Y\to\mathbb R^d$ (e.g., Sentence-BERT).  

3.2 Calibration Phase  
Data Collection  
Construct a calibration dataset $\mathcal D_{\mathrm{cal}}=\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ of prompt–reference pairs, drawn from the same or related distribution as test prompts. Recommended sizes: $N=500\text{–}5000$ depending on domain diversity.  

Nonconformity Score  
Define the nonconformity score $A(x,y)$ as the semantic distance between $y$ and the closest candidate among $K$ outputs:  
$$
A(x,y)\;=\;\min_{1\le k\le K}\;d\bigl(\phi(y),\,\phi(\hat y^k(x))\bigr),
$$  
where $d(u,v)=1-\cos(u,v)$ or $d(u,v)=\|u-v\|_2$. For each calibration example $(x_i,y_i)$, sample $\{\hat y^k_i\}_{k=1}^K$ from the LLM and compute  
$$
S_i\;\coloneqq\;A(x_i,y_i).
$$  

Threshold Estimation  
Let $S_{(1)}\le S_{(2)}\le\cdots\le S_{(N)}$ denote the sorted nonconformity scores. Define  
$$
\tau\;=\;S_{(\lceil(1-\alpha)(N+1)\rceil)}.
$$  
By the classical conformal prediction guarantee, if $(x_i,y_i)$ are i.i.d., then under exchangeability,  
$$
\Pr\bigl(S_{N+1}\le \tau\bigr)\;\ge\;1-\alpha,
$$  
ensuring finite‐sample coverage.  

3.3 Prediction Phase  
Given a new prompt $x_{\mathrm{test}}$:  
  1. Sample $K$ candidates $\{\hat y^k\}_{k=1}^K$ from the LLM.  
  2. Embed each candidate via $\phi(\hat y^k)$.  
  3. Compute nonconformity scores $s^k = d(\phi(\hat y^k), \{\phi(y_i)\}_{i=1}^N)$ using  
     $$s^k = \min_{i\le N} \; d\bigl(\phi(\hat y^k),\,\phi(y_i)\bigr),$$  
     or, to reduce computation, approximate by distance to the nearest calibration candidate in embedding space via FAISS or Annoy.  
  4. Define the prediction set  
     $$\mathcal C(x_{\mathrm{test}})=\{\hat y^k : s^k\le\tau\}.$$  
  5. If $\mathcal C(x_{\mathrm{test}})=\emptyset$, optionally return the single candidate with minimal $s^k$ as a fallback.  

Algorithm 1: Calibration  
Input: Calibration set $\mathcal D_{\mathrm{cal}}$, black-box LLM, embedding $\phi$, sample size $K$, miscoverage $\alpha$.  
Output: Threshold $\tau$.  
1. For $i=1,\dots,N$:  
   a. Draw $\{\hat y_i^k\}_{k=1}^K$ from LLM $(x_i)$.  
   b. Compute $S_i=\min_k d(\phi(y_i),\phi(\hat y_i^k))$.  
2. Sort $\{S_i\}$ and set $\tau=S_{(\lceil(1-\alpha)(N+1)\rceil)}$.  

Algorithm 2: Prediction  
Input: Prompt $x$, LLM, $\phi$, $\tau$, $K$.  
Output: Prediction set $\mathcal C(x)$.  
1. Sample $\{\hat y^k\}_{k=1}^K$.  
2. For each $k$, compute $s^k=\min_{i} d(\phi(\hat y^k),\,\phi(y_i))$ (or approximate nearest).  
3. Return $\{\hat y^k: s^k\le\tau\}$.  

3.4 Extensions: Chain-of-Thought  
To audit reasoning chains, let each chain‐of‐thought $\rho=(r_1,\dots,r_T)$ be embedded via $\psi(\rho)\in\mathbb R^d$ using a discourse encoder. Calibrate distances $d(\psi(\rho_i),\psi(\hat\rho_i^k))$ analogously and filter chains that satisfy $s^\rho\le\tau_\rho$. This yields sets of reasoning chains with guaranteed coverage over true chains, enabling richer risk analysis.  

3.5 Experimental Design

Evaluation Metrics  
1. Empirical coverage:  
   $$\widehat{\mathrm{cov}} = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{j=1}^M \mathbf{1}\{y_j\in \mathcal C(x_j)\}.$$  
   Target: $\widehat{\mathrm{cov}}\ge 1-\alpha$.  
2. Average set size: $\bar s = (1/M)\sum_j|\mathcal C(x_j)|$.  
3. Hallucination rate: fraction of tokens in $\mathcal C(x)$ not supported by reference.  
4. Computation time per example (sampling + embedding).  
5. Chain correctness: percent of returned reasoning chains that contain the true chain footnotes.  

Ablations  
• Vary calibration set size $N\in\{500,1000,2000,5000\}$.  
• Compare $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ choices: cosine vs Euclidean.  
• Nearest‐neighbor approximation vs full distance.  
• Domain transfer: calibrate on summarization, test on QA.  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

Expected Outcomes  
1. Validated coverage: SCPS attains empirical coverage $\ge1-\alpha$ across tasks and LLMs.  
2. Efficient sets: Compared to baselines, SCPS yields smaller average set sizes $\bar s$ for the same coverage, reducing user burden.  
3. Hallucination mitigation: By filtering out semantically distant outputs, SCPS decreases hallucination rates by 15–30% relative to internal‐score thresholds.  
4. Scalability: Nearest‐neighbor embedding approximations speed up prediction by 2× without sacrificing coverage.  
5. Chain-of-Thought audits: Extensions yield finite‐sample guarantees on reasoning chains, enabling detection of diverging or low‐confidence chains.  

Broader Impact  
Semantic Conformal Prediction Sets provide practitioners with rigorous, distribution-free uncertainty estimates for black-box LLMs, unlocking safe deployment in sensitive domains. Our method requires no access to proprietary model internals, making it broadly applicable to existing APIs. SCPS can serve as a building block for:  
• Risk‐aware human–AI collaboration: flagging uncertain responses for human review.  
• Regulatory compliance: providing auditable uncertainty guarantees in finance and healthcare.  
• Model auditing: quantifying overconfidence and hallucination tendencies across model versions.  

Future Directions  
• Group‐conditional coverage: adapt SCPS to guarantee coverage within subpopulations (e.g., medical vs. legal prompts).  
• Active calibration: select calibration examples that maximally improve threshold estimation.  
• Multi-modal extension: apply semantic conformal sets to image-captioning and vision-language tasks.  
• Integration with uncertainty‐driven prompting: dynamically adjust prompt design based on SCPS outputs.  

In summary, our research will deliver a principled, practical framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification in black-box LLMs. By leveraging semantic embeddings and conformal prediction, we aim to set a new standard for reliable, safe language model deployment in high-stakes applications.
