**Federated Distillation for Efficient and Collaborative Training of Open Foundation Models**

### 2. **Introduction**  

#### **Background**  
Foundation models (FMs) like GPT-4 and CLIP have revolutionized AI research by achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. However, their development demands massive computational resources and centralized access to vast datasets, restricting participation to well-funded institutions and undermining open science principles. While techniques like knowledge distillation reduce model sizes, they typically assume access to the original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns or logistical challenges. Federated learning (FL) mitigates these issues by enabling collaborative training without data sharing, but traditional FL frameworks face high communication costs and struggle with heterogeneous data and model architectures.  

#### **Research Objectives**  
This proposal aims to develop **Federated Distillation (FD)**, a framework for collaboratively training efficient, open FMs using decentralized data and compute resources. Specific objectives include:  
1. Design a federated distillation system that trains a central student FM by aggregating knowledge from specialist models trained on distributed datasets.  
2. Ensure communication efficiency and scalability while addressing data/model heterogeneity and privacy constraints.  
3. Validate the framework’s effectiveness through large-scale experiments across diverse modalities (e.g., NLP, vision) and use cases (e.g., healthcare, education).  

#### **Significance**  
By decoupling FM training from centralized data and compute infrastructures, FD democratizes access to foundation model development, aligning with the SCI-FM workshop’s goals of fostering reproducibility and open science. The framework reduces reliance on proprietary datasets, enhances privacy, and provides a systematic methodology for building efficient, task-agnostic FMs. Successful implementation could accelerate research in underrepresented domains (e.g., medicine) and empower resource-constrained institutions to contribute to FM innovation.

### 3. **Methodology**  

#### **Research Design**  
**Framework Overview**  
The FD framework consists of:  
1. **Local Specialist Training**: Multiple institutions train specialist models on their private datasets.  
2. **Knowledge Distillation via Proxy Data**: Specialists generate outputs (e.g., logits, embeddings) on a shared public proxy dataset.  
3. **Global Aggregation**: A central student FM learns by distilling aggregated outputs, avoiding direct access to raw data.  

#### **Data Collection & Processing**  
- **Private Datasets**: Institutions use domain-specific datasets (e.g., hospital records, educational content) under strict privacy protocols.  
- **Public Proxy Dataset**: A curated, open dataset (e.g., C4 for NLP, ImageNet-1k for vision) serves as the distillation medium.  

#### **Algorithmic Steps**  
1. **Local Specialist Training**:  
   Each client $k$ trains a specialist model $M_k$ on local data $D_k$:  
   $$\min_{\theta_k} \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(M_k(\theta_k; x), y), \quad \forall (x, y) \in D_k.$$  

2. **Proxy Dataset Processing**:  
   Clients compute soft labels (logits) or gradient updates on the proxy dataset $D_{\text{proxy}}$:  
   $$S_k(x') = M_k(\theta_k; x'), \quad \forall x' \in D_{\text{proxy}}.$$  

3. **Global Knowledge Aggregation**:  
   The server aggregates outputs using attention-weighted averaging to prioritize high-confidence predictions:  
   $$S_{\text{global}}(x') = \sum_{k=1}^K \alpha_k S_k(x'), \quad \alpha_k = \frac{\exp(\text{conf}(S_k(x')))}{\sum_j \exp(\text{conf}(S_j(x')))}.$$  

4. **Student Model Training**:  
   The student FM $M_{\text{student}}$ minimizes a distillation loss over $D_{\text{proxy}}$:  
   $$\min_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}}(M_{\text{student}}(\phi; x'), S_{\text{global}}(x')).$$  

To reduce communication overhead, clients may transmit quantized gradients or low-rank approximations of logits.  

#### **Experimental Design**  
**Baselines & Metrics**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against federated averaging (FedAvg), standalone distillation, and centralized training.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Accuracy**: Task-specific metrics (e.g., F1, BLEU).  
  - **Efficiency**: Communication cost (GB transferred), training time, and GPU-hour consumption.  
  - **Robustness**: Performance under varying data heterogeneity (via Dirichlet split $\alpha=0.1$ vs. $\alpha=1.0$).  
  - **Privacy**: Measure leakage via membership inference attacks.  

**Datasets & Models**  
- **NLP**: Use C4 and The Pile for pretraining, with FLAN-T5 (student) and GPT-3 architectures.  
- **Vision**: Train on federated medical imaging datasets with Vision Transformers.  

**Implementation Details**  
- Use PyTorch Federated and Flower for simulation.  
- Hyperparameters: Local epochs = 3, distillation temperature = 2, learning rate = 5e-5.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

#### **Outcomes**  
1. **Framework Validation**: FD will achieve comparable accuracy to centralized training while reducing communication costs by 40–60% (vs. FedAvg).  
2. **Scalability Analysis**: The method will scale to 100+ clients with minimal performance degradation.  
3. **Benchmarking**: Open-source benchmarks for federated FM training, including metrics for privacy-efficiency trade-offs.  

#### **Impact**  
1. **Democratizing FM Development**: Lower resource requirements will enable small labs and global south institutions to participate in FM research.  
2. **Open Science Contributions**: Public release of FD code, pretrained models, and protocols to promote reproducibility.  
3. **Theoretical Advances**: New insights into federated distillation dynamics and cross-domain knowledge transfer.

### 5. **Conclusion**  

This proposal addresses critical challenges in open foundation model development through federated distillation. By synergizing distributed training with knowledge aggregation, FD offers a scalable, privacy-preserving pathway to democratize AI innovation. The outcomes will advance open science initiatives and provide practical tools for training resource-efficient FMs across diverse applications.
