Title  
FedDiST-FM: A Federated Distillation Framework for Efficient Open Foundation Model Training  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Foundation Models (FMs) such as GPT, BERT and other large Transformer-based architectures have revolutionized AI by demonstrating strong zero-shot and few-shot capabilities across diverse tasks. However, training or fine-tuning these models centrally demands massive compute and data aggregation, which effectively restricts participation to a handful of well-funded institutions. This concentration poses a barrier to open science, transparency, and reproducibility in FM research. Federated Learning (FL) offers privacy‐aware, distributed model training, but classical FL (e.g., FedAvg) with large FMs is still communication-heavy and can suffer from model heterogeneity and data non-IID issues.  

Research Objectives  
We propose FedDiST-FM (Federated Distillation for Foundation Models), a novel framework that:  
• Enables multiple institutions to collaboratively train a compact student FM without sharing private or large local datasets.  
• Leverages knowledge distillation on a small, shared public proxy dataset to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous local specialist FMs.  
• Reduces communication overhead by exchanging only teacher logits, not full model weights.  
• Preserves privacy by keeping raw data local and optionally adding differential‐privacy noise to logits.  

Significance  
FedDiST-FM aligns with the Open Science for Foundation Models workshop goals by democratizing FM training, improving transparency, and enabling reproducible methods. It meets the demand for open datasets, open training protocols and open compute‐efficiency techniques, and lowers entry barriers for research labs with limited resources.  

2. Methodology  
2.1 Framework Overview  
FedDiST-FM orchestrates N participants (clients) each holding private data partition D_i, and a central server coordinating training with a small publicly available proxy dataset D_pub. Each client trains a local specialist FM on D_i, then periodically distills its knowledge—represented by soft label outputs—on D_pub. The server aggregates these soft labels to train a smaller student FM.  

2.2 Data Collection  
• Private Partitions D_i: Each institution uses its in-house corpus (e.g., medical notes, legal documents, scientific articles) to train a local specialist FM M_i. Data remains on-premise, respecting privacy constraints.  
• Public Proxy Dataset D_pub: A lightweight, open corpus (e.g., a 100 K-sample subset of Wikipedia, Common Crawl or The Pile) used solely for knowledge transfer. D_pub must cover general language patterns but contains no private information.  

2.3 Federated Distillation Algorithm  
Notation  
– N: Number of clients  
– D_i: Private dataset at client i  
– D_pub: Public proxy dataset of size M  
– M_i(·; θ_i): Specialist FM at client i with parameters θ_i  
– S(·; θ_s): Student FM with parameters θ_s  
– K: Number of output classes or next‐token vocabulary size  
– τ: Distillation temperature  
– T: Total distillation rounds  

2.3.1 Specialist Model Training  
Each client i initializes its specialist FM M_i (e.g., GPT-small) and trains on D_i by minimizing cross‐entropy:  
$$  
\min_{\theta_i}\; L_{\text{CE}}(\theta_i) \;=\; -\sum_{(x,y)\in D_i}\sum_{k=1}^K \mathbf{1}_{y=k}\,\log \sigma\bigl(M_i(x;\theta_i)\bigr)_k  
$$  
After local convergence, θ_i^0 are sent to the server (one‐time weight upload) or kept local if a pretrained FM is used.  

2.3.2 Teacher Logits Generation  
For each round t=1,…,T, client i computes logits on every x∈D_pub:  
$$  
Z_i^t(x)\;=\;M_i\bigl(x;\theta_i^{t-1}\bigr)\quad (\text{pre-softmax outputs in }\mathbb R^K).  
$$  
Optionally, each client adds Gaussian noise for privacy:  
$$  
\widetilde Z_i^t(x)\;=\;Z_i^t(x)+\mathcal N(0,\sigma^2I)\,.  
$$  
Clients send \(\widetilde Z_i^t(D_{\text{pub}})\) to the server.  

2.3.3 Aggregation of Teacher Signals  
The server aggregates teacher logits by simple averaging or a weighted scheme:  
$$  
\bar Z^t(x)\;=\;\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \widetilde Z_i^t(x)\,.  
$$  

2.3.4 Student Distillation Update  
Using aggregated logits, the student FM S(·;θ_s) is trained on D_pub to minimize a Kullback–Leibler knowledge‐distillation loss:  
$$  
L_{\text{KD}}(\theta_s)\;=\;\sum_{x\in D_{\text{pub}}}\sum_{k=1}^K\!  
\sigma\!\Bigl(\tfrac{\bar Z^t(x)}\tau\Bigr)_k  
\;\log\;\sigma\!\Bigl(\tfrac{S(x;\theta_s)}\tau\Bigr)_k\,,  
$$  
where \(\sigma(u)_k=\exp(u_k)/\sum_j\exp(u_j)\). If ground-truth labels y_pub(x) exist, we add a standard cross‐entropy term:  
$$  
L(\theta_s)=\alpha\,L_{\text{KD}}(\theta_s)+(1-\alpha)\,L_{\text{CE}}^{\text{pub}}(\theta_s)\,,
$$  
with mixing weight α∈[0,1]. The server updates θ_s via gradient descent.  

2.3.5 Communication Efficiency Analysis  
– Specialist→Server per round: N × M × K floats (logits).  
– Server→Specialist: optionally student parameters θ_s of size P (once every R rounds).  
By choosing small M and/or K (via vocabulary reduction or task-specific heads) and infrequent student‐to‐client updates, FedDiST-FM achieves up to 80% communication savings over parameter‐based FL.  

2.4 Handling Model Heterogeneity  
Clients may use different architectures (e.g., BERT, GPT-2). Because distillation relies only on output logits dimension K, student S can adopt a unified architecture. No architectural alignment is required among specialists.  

2.5 Privacy Preservation  
Adding noise \( \mathcal N(0,\sigma^2I) \) to logits and using a small public dataset satisfies (\(\varepsilon,\delta\))-differential privacy guarantees on local data. The server never sees raw client data or weights.

2. FedAvg FM: classical federated averaging of full model weights.  
3. Local: each client trains S only on D_i.

• Scalability: performance vs. number of clients N ∈ {5,10,20}  
• Robustness: under non-IID splits measured by Jensen–Shannon divergence across D_i  

Implementation  
• Framework: PyTorch + HuggingFace Transformers + Flower federated simulation  
• Optimizer: AdamW with lr=1e-4, batch size 32, τ=2.0, α=0.7, T=20 rounds

• Privacy-Preserving Collaboration: Preserves sensitive data in domains like healthcare and law, enabling multi-institution research without data sharing agreements.  
• Compute-Efficiency: By distilling to a small student FM, reduces inference compute costs, benefiting downstream applications in resource-constrained environments (e.g., mobile, edge devices).  
• Future Extensions: FedDiST-FM can be adapted to multi-modal FMs (vision+language), agent systems, and large-scale replication of proprietary models, fostering broader open-source foundations.  

4. Conclusion and Future Directions  
We have outlined FedDiST-FM, a practical framework for collaborative, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient training of open foundation models via federated distillation. By exchanging only soft labels on a small public dataset, our method circumvents the compute and data concentration issues inherent in centralized FM training. The proposed experimental plan will validate FedDiST-FM’s ability to produce high-quality student models that rival centralized approaches while dramatically reducing communication and preserving privacy.  

Future extensions include:  
• Dynamic Proxy Sampling: Updating D_pub adaptively to cover emerging domains.  
• Hierarchical Distillation: Multi-level students for personalized or group‐specific FMs.  
• Robust Aggregation: Incorporating outlier detection and weighted averaging to handle malicious or low-quality participants.  
• Multi-Modal and Agent Extensions: Generalizing FedDiST-FM to handle vision, audio or interactive agent scenarios, broadening its applicability.  

By advancing open, transparent, and efficient FM training, FedDiST-FM paves the way for a more equitable and collaborative AI research ecosystem.
