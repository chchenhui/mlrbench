# Federated Distillation for Efficient Open Foundation Model Training

## Introduction

### Background
Foundation Models (FMs) have significantly advanced AI research by enabling transfer learning across diverse tasks. However, their development is limited to well-resourced institutions due to massive computational and data requirements, hindering open science. Traditional distillation techniques, which compress knowledge from large models to smaller ones, often require centralized data access, violating privacy constraints and limiting scalability. Federated Learning (FL) addresses data privacy by decentralizing training but faces challenges like communication inefficiency, data heterogeneity, and model divergence.

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop **FedDist**, a Federated Knowledge Distillation framework for training efficient open FMs. Key objectives are:  
1. **Enhance data privacy** by avoiding centralized data collection.  
2. **Reduce communication costs** via distilled knowledge aggregation.  
3. **Mitigate data heterogeneity** through proxy-driven distillation.  
4. **Democratize access** to FM training across distributed compute/data resources.  

### Significance  
By decoupling model training from data centralization, FedDist will lower entry barriers for under-resourced researchers, aligning with the SCI-FM workshop's goals of transparency and reproducibility. It will produce compact, high-performance models that address compute-intensive tasks like multi-modal reasoning while maintaining privacy in domains like healthcare and education.

## Methodology

### Framework Overview  
FedDist operates via three interlocked components (Figure 1):  
1. **Local Specialization**: Participating institutions train domain-specific teacher models on private data.  
2. **Knowledge Distillation**: A lightweight student FM learns from teacher model outputs evaluated on a **shared proxy dataset** (publicly accessible).  
3. **Communication-Efficient Aggregation**: Distilled knowledge is compressed and aggregated at the server to update the student model.

### Proxy Dataset Construction  
The proxy dataset $\mathcal{D}_p = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ serves as a universal reference for knowledge aggregation. It is designed to:  
- Be **small-scale** ($N \sim 10^4$) yet **diverse** (e.g., synthesized via GANs or curated from public sources like ImageNet subsets).  
- Retain label consistency (for supervised tasks) or semantic richness (for self-supervised learning).  
- Enable robust generalization across data-heterogeneous clients.

### Local Specialist Training  

Each client $c$ trains a teacher model $T_c$ on their private dataset $\mathcal{D}_c$ using task-specific losses ($\mathcal{L}_{task}$). For example:  
- **Vision classification**: Cross-entropy loss with label smoothing:  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{cls} = -\sum_{c=1}^C \left[(1 - y_c)\log(1 - T_c(x)) + \beta y_c \log T_c(x)\right]
  $$
  where $\beta$ balances class weights in imbalanced data splits.  
- **Language modeling**: Per-token cross-entropy loss with gradient clipping.  

**Techniques to Mitigate Data Heterogeneity**:  
- **Local Model Regularization**: Adding a domain-invariant regularization term:
  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{reg} = \lambda \cdot \text{KL}(\text{softmax}(T_c(x)/\tau)\ \|\ \text{Uniform distribution})
  $$
  to encourage robust features.  
- **Differential Privacy (DP)**: Perturbing outputs with Laplace noise to bound privacy leakage.

### Knowledge Distillation & Aggregation  

#### Server-to-Client Communication  
The server broadcasts the current student model $S_t$ and proxy dataset $\mathcal{D}_p$ to all clients.  

#### Client-to-Server Knowledge Transfer  
Each client $c$ computes teacher outputs on $\mathcal{D}_p$ using temperature-scaled softmax:  
$$
p_c(x_i) = \text{softmax}(f_c(x_i)/\tau)
$$
where $f_c$ is the penultimate layer logit. Outputs are compressed via:  
- **Logit Quantization**: Reducing precision to 16-bit floating points.  
- **Top-K Selection**: Transmitting only the top-$k$ logits per sample.  

The server aggregates knowledge into a teacher ensemble $\bar{p}(x_i)$:  
$$
\bar{p}(x_i) = \frac{1}{C} \sum_{c=1}^C w_c \cdot p_c(x_i)
$$
where $w_c$ weights clients by dataset size or validation performance.  

#### Student Model Update  
The student $S_{t+1}$ is trained using:  
1. A **distillation loss** $\mathcal{L}_{kd}$ measuring alignment with $\bar{p}(x_i)$:  
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{kd} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \text{KL}\left(\bar{p}(x_i)\ \|\ \text{softmax}(S_t(x_i)/\tau)\right)
   $$
2. A **task-specific loss** $\mathcal{L}_{task}$ on labeled proxy data (if available):  
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{task} = \text{CrossEntropy}(S_t(x_i), y_i)
   $$
3. **Weighted Loss Function**:  
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{total} = \alpha \cdot \mathcal{L}_{task} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \mathcal{L}_{kd}
   $$
   where $\alpha$ balances proxy labels and teacher ensemble guidance.  

#### Communication Efficiency  
Total data transmitted per round:  
$$
B = C \cdot N_p \cdot D_l \cdot D_c
$$
where $N_p$: proxy samples, $D_l$: logit dimensions, $D_c$: client count. Compression techniques reduce $D_l$.
