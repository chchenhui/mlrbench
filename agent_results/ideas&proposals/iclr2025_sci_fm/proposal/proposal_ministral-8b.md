# Federated Distillation for Efficient Open Foundation Model Training

## 1. Introduction

Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence by enabling a wide range of applications with a single, versatile model. However, the lack of scientific transparency and the computational resources required for training FMs have limited their accessibility and reproducibility. This research aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel federated distillation framework that enables collaborative training of smaller, efficient open FMs without centralizing sensitive or large datasets. The proposed framework leverages distributed compute and data resources efficiently, enhancing data privacy, reducing communication overhead, and democratizing the creation of capable, open FMs.

### 1.1 Background

Foundation models are large-scale AI models pre-trained on vast amounts of data across various domains. They have shown remarkable performance in tasks ranging from natural language processing to computer vision. However, the training of these models requires substantial computational resources, making it challenging for researchers and organizations with limited resources to participate in the development and advancement of FMs. Additionally, the lack of transparency and reproducibility in the training process hinders the replication and validation of results, impeding the progress of open science.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:

1. **Develop a Federated Distillation Framework**: Create a framework that enables collaborative training of smaller, efficient open FMs across multiple institutions without centralizing sensitive or large datasets.
2. **Enhance Data Privacy**: Ensure that the proposed framework preserves data privacy and does not compromise the security of sensitive information.
3. **Reduce Communication Overhead**: Minimize the communication costs associated with training large models in a federated setting by aggregating knowledge from local models' outputs or gradient updates.
4. **Improve Model Performance**: Develop a methodology that results in performant, resource-friendly open FMs that can be used for a wide range of applications.

### 1.3 Significance

The significance of this research lies in its potential to democratize the development and training of foundation models. By enabling collaborative training and reducing the computational and communication requirements, the proposed framework will make it possible for researchers and organizations with limited resources to contribute to the advancement of FMs. Additionally, the emphasis on data privacy and transparency will foster a more open and reproducible scientific environment, accelerating the progress of AI research.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Research Design

The proposed federated distillation framework consists of two main components: the client-side model training and the server-side model aggregation. The overall process is illustrated in Figure 1.

#### 2.1.1 Client-Side Model Training

Each participating institution trains a local specialist model on its own data partition. The local model is trained using a standard supervised learning algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), with the local data. The local model outputs are then used to generate distilled knowledge, which is sent to the server for aggregation.

#### 2.1.2 Server-Side Model Aggregation

The server aggregates the distilled knowledge from the local models to train a smaller, global student FM. The global model is trained using the aggregated distilled knowledge, which is obtained by combining the outputs or gradient updates from the local models. The global model is then used for inference and downstream tasks.

### 2.2 Data Collection

The data used in this research will be obtained from publicly available datasets that are relevant to the applications of foundation models. The data will be divided into partitions, with each partition assigned to a different participating institution. The data partitions will be used to train the local specialist models.

### 2.3 Algorithmic Steps

#### 2.3.1 Local Model Training

1. **Data Partitioning**: Divide the dataset into non-overlapping partitions, with each partition assigned to a different participating institution.
2. **Local Model Training**: Each institution trains a local specialist model on its assigned data partition using a standard supervised learning algorithm, such as SGD.
3. **Distillation**: Generate distilled knowledge from the local model's outputs or gradient updates. This can be done using various knowledge distillation techniques, such as teacher-student learning or model compression.
4. **Communication**: Send the distilled knowledge to the server for aggregation.

#### 2.3.2 Global Model Training

1. **Aggregation**: The server aggregates the distilled knowledge from the local models. This can be done using various aggregation techniques, such as averaging, weighted averaging, or Federated Averaging (FedAvg).
2. **Global Model Training**: Train a smaller, global student FM using the aggregated distilled knowledge. This can be done using a standard supervised learning algorithm, such as SGD.
3. **Inference**: Use the global model for inference and downstream tasks.

### 2.4 Experimental Design

To validate the proposed framework, we will conduct experiments using publicly available datasets and evaluate the performance of the global model on various benchmarks. The experimental design will consist of the following steps:

1. **Dataset Selection**: Select publicly available datasets that are relevant to the applications of foundation models.
2. **Data Partitioning**: Divide the datasets into non-overlapping partitions, with each partition assigned to a different participating institution.
3. **Local Model Training**: Each institution trains a local specialist model on its assigned data partition using the proposed federated distillation framework.
4. **Global Model Training**: The server aggregates the distilled knowledge from the local models and trains a global student FM using the aggregated distilled knowledge.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the global model on various benchmarks, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 2.5 Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the proposed framework will be evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Model Accuracy**: Measure the accuracy of the global model on various benchmarks.
2. **Communication Cost**: Measure the amount of data transferred between the clients and the server during the training process.
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Measure the computational resources required for training the local specialist models and the global student FM.
4. **Data Privacy**: Measure the level of data privacy preserved by the proposed framework.
