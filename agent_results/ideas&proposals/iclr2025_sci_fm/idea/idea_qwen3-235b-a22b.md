**Title:** Dynamic and Interactive Benchmarking for Transparent Foundation Model Evaluation  

**Motivation:** Foundation models (FMs) often exhibit performance disparities across tasks and scenarios, yet current evaluation methodologies rely on static benchmarks that inadequately capture robustness, adaptability, or real-world generalization. This lack of dynamic assessment hinders reproducibility, creates biased comparisons, and obscures failure modes critical for safety and fairness. Developing adaptive, community-driven evaluation frameworks is essential to ensure transparency and accelerate trustworthy FM development.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a dynamic, open-source benchmarking framework that integrates adversarial and interactive evaluation protocols. The framework would host evolving challenges—via adversarial example generators, contextual task variations, and human-in-the-loop simulations—to test FMs under diverse, real-world conditions. It would use open-source platforms (e.g., Hugging Face) for crowdsourced benchmark curation and version-controlled updates, ensuring reproducibility. Methodology includes: (1) adversarial training data synthesizers that generate edge-case inputs, (2) interactive environments where FMs must adapt to real-time feedback, and (3) metrics measuring robustness, energy efficiency, and fairness. Expected outcomes include standardized dynamic benchmarks, open-sourced evaluation toolkits, and public leaderboards tracking FM performance over time. This could revolutionize FM accountability, enabling systematic study of emergent capabilities and limitations while fostering community-driven improvements. Impact includes democratized access to rigorous evaluation tools, guiding model development toward dependability and ethical deployment.
