Title: ChemBrite – An Open Multi-Modal Foundation Model for Chemistry Research and Education

Motivation: 
Advances in foundation models have largely bypassed chemistry’s unique multi-modal needs—molecular graphs, reaction diagrams, spectra and textual protocols. A transparent, open-access chemistry FM can accelerate discovery, standardize reproducible benchmarks, and democratize learning for researchers and students worldwide.

Main Idea: 
• Dataset Curation: Harvest and unify public chemical databases (e.g., PubChem, USPTO, RCSB PDB) into a multi-modal corpus pairing molecular graphs, reaction images, NMR/IR spectra and textual annotations. Augment with synthetic reaction pathways generated via rule-based cheminformatics.  
• Model Architecture & Training: Design a hybrid transformer–graph-neural architecture with:  
  – Graph encoder for molecular structure  
  – Vision encoder for reaction schematics and spectra  
  – Text decoder for protocol and mechanism description  
  Train with self-supervised objectives (masked graph modeling, image-region classification, text infilling) followed by instruction tuning on tasks like reaction prediction, retrosynthesis and mechanism explanation.  
• Evaluation & Impact: Release an open benchmark suite (yield prediction, retrosynthesis accuracy, explanation quality) alongside model weights. ChemBrite will empower reproducible chemical AI research, accelerate drug/material discovery, and enhance chemistry education through interactive, explainable tooling.
