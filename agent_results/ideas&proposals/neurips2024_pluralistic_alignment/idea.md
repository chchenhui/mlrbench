# Multi-Objective Value Representation (MOVR): A Framework for Capturing Preference Diversity in AI Alignment

## Motivation
Current AI alignment methods struggle with the inherent diversity of human values, often imposing homogeneous ethical frameworks that fail to represent global cultural and moral diversity. This reductionist approach risks perpetuating biases and marginalizing minority perspectives. As AI systems increasingly make consequential decisions in pluralistic societies, we need alignment techniques that can represent, reason about, and balance competing value systems without artificially resolving fundamental disagreements through simple aggregation or majority rule.

## Main Idea
MOVR is a technical framework that maintains distinct representation spaces for different value systems rather than collapsing them into a single utility function. The approach builds on vector-valued reinforcement learning and multi-objective optimization to train AI systems that can represent multiple ethical frameworks simultaneously. The core innovation is a context-sensitive arbitration mechanism that identifies when value conflicts occur and applies different resolution strategies depending on the stakes and context: consensus-seeking for areas of potential agreement, explicit surfacing of trade-offs for substantive disagreements, and adaptive weighting when decisions must be made despite irreconcilable differences. MOVR incorporates preference elicitation methods from diverse demographic groups to build distinct value representations and includes interpretability tools that make explicit which values are prioritized in specific decisions, enhancing transparency and human oversight.
