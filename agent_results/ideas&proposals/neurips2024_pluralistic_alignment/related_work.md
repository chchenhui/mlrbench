**Key Challenges:**

1. **Capturing the Full Spectrum of Human Values**: Developing AI systems that accurately represent the vast and often conflicting range of human values remains a significant challenge.

2. **Resolving Value Conflicts**: Designing mechanisms that can effectively arbitrate between competing value systems without imposing a dominant framework is complex.

3. **Ensuring Transparency and Interpretability**: Creating AI systems whose decision-making processes are transparent and interpretable to diverse stakeholders is essential for trust and accountability.

4. **Preference Elicitation from Diverse Populations**: Accurately eliciting and integrating preferences from diverse demographic groups to inform AI alignment is challenging due to varying cultural and individual differences.

5. **Adaptive Decision-Making in Dynamic Contexts**: Developing AI systems capable of adapting their decision-making strategies in response to changing contexts and stakes is crucial for effective alignment.
