**Title:** Disagreement-Aware RLHF for Pluralistic Value Alignment

**Motivation:** Standard AI alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often average or discard conflicting human feedback, failing to capture the richness of diverse values. This leads to models reflecting only dominant perspectives or a potentially unrepresentative consensus, hindering the development of truly pluralistic AI systems needed for complex societal applications.

**Main Idea:** We propose enhancing RLHF by explicitly modeling annotation disagreements found in preference data. Instead of training a single reward model predicting an average preference, we will develop a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reward model architecture. Each expert within the MoE will be trained to represent a distinct cluster of consistent preferences identified from the annotation data (e.g., using clustering techniques on preference vectors or leveraging annotator metadata). During the RL fine-tuning phase, the policy can then be optimized against a weighted combination of these expert rewards, potentially allowing dynamic adjustment based on context or user group, or enabling the generation of diverse outputs reflecting different valid value perspectives. This approach directly learns from disagreement, fostering AI capable of navigating and representing conflicting human values.
