1. **Title**: **Neural Optimal Transport for Amortized Bayesian Inference in High-Dimensional Spaces**  

2. **Motivation**:  
   Sampling from high-dimensional, unnormalized distributions (e.g., Bayesian posteriors, Boltzmann densities) remains computationally prohibitive, especially when repeated inference is required across related tasks. Classical samplers like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) suffer from slow convergence in such settings, while learning-based methods often lack generalization or theoretical guarantees. Bridging optimal transport (OT) theory with neural function approximation could enable amortized samplers that provably accelerate inference across a distribution family, with transformative applications in molecular dynamics, Bayesian deep learning, and LLM fine-tuning.  

3. **Main Idea**:  
   We propose **Neural Wasserstein Gradient Flows (NWGF)**, a framework that learns time-dependent transport maps approximating the Wasserstein gradient flow of a target distribution. By parameterizing the transport map as a neural network trained via a physics-informed loss (e.g., minimizing the Benamou-Brenier action), NWGF learns to push forward a base distribution (e.g., Gaussian) to diverse targets within a distribution family (e.g., Boltzmann distributions with varying potentials). The learned map amortizes the cost of solving the Monge problem for new targets, enabling rapid sampling without retraining. We further incorporate Hamiltonian dynamics into the flow to preserve energy conservation in physical systems. Expected outcomes include: (1) a 10–100× speedup over HMC in molecular dynamics simulations, (2) theoretical analysis linking generalization to OT geometry, and (3) open-source benchmarks for amortized sampling in Bayesian neural networks. This work bridges OT theory, deep learning, and physics-inspired sampling, addressing key challenges in scalability and adaptability for real-world applications.
