**Title:** Diffusion-Based Inference-Time Alignment for Language Models via Target Density Sampling  

**Motivation:** Current alignment methods for large language models (LLMs), learning from learning from human feedback (RLHF), require costly fine-tuning and struggle with instability or over-optimization. A learning-based sampling approach could enable dynamic, on-the-fly alignment during inference without retraining, addressing limitations in flexibility and efficiency.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a diffusion-inspired sampler that generates text by iteratively denoising sequences while incorporating guidance from a target reward model (e.g., safety or quality metrics). The method trains a transition kernel to sample from the joint distribution of the base LLM and the target density, using gradient-based updates akin to Langevin dynamics. This allows steering generation toward high-reward regions without modifying the base model weights. Key innovations include a token-level diffusion process with learned noise schedules and a lightweight reward-aware proposal distribution. Expected outcomes are efficient, controllable alignment and reduced computational overhead compared to fine-tuning. If successful, this could enable real-time adaptation of LLMs to diverse constraints or user preferences.
