### Literature Review and Challenges

Several recent studies have explored the application of diffusion-based methods for inference-time alignment of language models, offering insights into both promising approaches and enduring challenges. Notably, **DiffPO [1]** proposes a diffusion-styled preference optimization framework at the sentence level, enabling efficient alignment without retraining the base model. This method demonstrates a favorable balance between alignment quality and computational efficiency, setting a strong precedent for research in this domain. Similarly, **Demon [2]** employs a stochastic optimization approach during the denoising process, allowing training-free alignment that leverages non-differentiable reward sources such as human judgments. Another noteworthy paper, **[3]**, introduces a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approach to navigate reward-aligned target distributions in diffusion models, particularly excelling in scenarios where reward over-optimization could undermine diversity. These studies collectively highlight the potential of diffusion models to provide an effective framework for inference-time alignment while reducing the need for comprehensive retraining.

Despite these advancements, several critical limitations and challenges remain unaddressed. First, **computational efficiency** is a persistent issue in diffusion-based methods. Iterative denoising processes inherent to these models introduce significant overhead, especially when alignment requirements demand rapid generation. Although sentence-level approaches like DiffPO [1] mitigate some concerns, per-token refinement (as explored in earlier work like [9]) remains computationally cumbersome. Second, challenges related to **reward function design** persist. Recent methods like Demon [2] have shown promise in avoiding gradient dependency through stochastic interventions, but they often rely on simplified or proxy reward signals that may misalign with complex, multi-faceted objectives required in real-world applications. Finally, **convergence and stability** issues arise in the dynamic, gradient-dominated environments typical of diffusion processes. Errors accumulated during iterative refinement can result in problematic outputs, while reward-guided updates may destabilize the generation process if improperly balanced. Addressing these gaps will require innovative strategies, such as learning adaptive noise schedules or incorporating structured reward-aware proposal distributions, as proposed in the current project.

### Research Objectives and Significance

The primary goal of this research is to develop and implement a novel diffusion-based inference-time alignment framework that overcomes the limitations of current methods by leveraging dynamic sampling strategies from unnormalized distributions. Specifically, our objective is to enable real-time alignment of language models without relying on costly fine-tuning procedures. This will be achieved through an iterative diffusion process that refines generated sequences while incorporating reward signals directly into the sampling mechanism, similar to gradient-based methods in Langevin dynamics. By analyzing the convergence behavior of such dynamic alignment processes and addressing key bottlenecks, we aim to provide a flexible, computationally efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning techniques.

The significance of this proposal lies in its potential to address two critical challenges: instability and inefficiency in alignment methods. Aligning a language model to human preferences has long been hindered by the high computational costs and training complexities involved in techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Beyond this, RLHF often introduces over-optimization, potentially leading to misaligned or unexpected outputs [3]. Our proposed method avoids these pitfalls by steering the modelâ€™s generation process directly toward high-reward regions of the probability space, circumventing the need for extensive model retraining. Additionally, the frameworkâ€™s design ensures robustness against reward over-optimization, a known limitation that earlier methods such as SMC-based approaches [3] partially address. 

Given the scope of the FPI workshopâ€™s focus on probabilistic inference, this proposal contributes a unique exploration of learning-based sampling methods in the context of inference-time alignment. By exploring the intersections between sampling dynamics, reward propagation, and dynamic alignment, this work bridges theoretical advancements in sampling from unnormalized distributions with practical applications in language model alignment. Moreover, this research has significant implications beyond theoretical progressâ€”it empowers practitioners to align LLMs efficiently to contemporary security, quality, and societal constraints, opening new avenues for adaptive, on-the-fly model customization in real-world settings.  

### Methodology

Our proposed methodology aims to address the challenges outlined in the literature review by developing a diffusion-based inference-time alignment framework that operates efficiently while maintaining high alignment quality. The methodology begins with the design of a diffusion-inspired sampling process, specifically tailored for language models (LLMs). This involves the definition of a forward noising process and a reverse denoising process. In the forward process, a base model's outputs are progressively corrupted with noise to approximate the data distribution, while the reverse process iteratively denoises the generated sequences, incorporating guidance from a target reward model to direct the sampling towards regions of high reward score without modifying the base model weights.

Mathematically, the forward process can be represented as:
$$
x_t = \sqrt{1 - \beta_t}x_{t-1} + \sqrt{\beta_t} \epsilon
$$
where $ x_0 $ is the original sequence generated by the base model and $ \epsilon $ is Gaussian noise. The variance of the noise $ \beta_t $ is learned through an adaptive schedule that balances exploration and exploitation during the denoising phase. The reverse process involves learning a transition kernel to refine the noise-corrupted output, defined as:
$$
p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t))
$$
where $ p_\theta $ approximates the posterior distribution, and $ \mu_\theta $ and $ \Sigma_\theta $ are parameterized using deep neural networks.

The iterative denoising process utilizes gradient-based updates derived from the reward function $ R(x) $, which quantifies alignment against desired attributes (e.g., safety, coherence, or utility). This guidance is integrated into the denoising step via:
$$
\mu_\theta(x_t, t) = x_t - \nabla_{x_t} \log p_{\text{target}}(x_t)
$$
where $ p_{\text{target}}(x_t) $ incorporates both the base model's distribution and the reward-guided adjustments, thus steering the sampling toward preferred configurations.

To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we will conduct a series of experiments across diverse application domains. These experiments will involve generating sequences under various reward models while comparing alignment quality, computational efficiency, and output diversity. The datasets will include benchmark prompts curated for qualitative assessments, with reward signals derived from both automatic metrics and human evaluations.

For evaluation, a range of metrics will be employed, including alignment quality, calculated as the average reward score across generated outputs, computational efficiency measured by response time and resource utilization, and stability indicators such as the consistency of alignment outcomes over multiple runs. We will benchmark our method against existing approaches like RLHF and other diffusion-based alignment methods, including DiffPO [1], to assess its competitive advantage in terms of both quality and efficiency.

Furthermore, we plan to explore the robustness of our framework by testing it under varying conditions, such as different reward functions and integration with diverse LLMs. This will help identify the adaptability of our method and highlight any potential limitations. Through these experiments, we aim to demonstrate that our proposed methodology not only achieves superior alignment performance but also significantly reduces the computational overhead associated with traditional retraining approaches, paving the way for real-time, dynamic alignment of LLMs in practical scenarios. ðŸš€

### Expected Outcomes and Contributions to the Field

The proposed diffusion-based inference-time alignment framework is expected to deliver significant advancements in both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of sampling methods for language models. By introducing a novel schema for integrating reward signals into iterative denoising processes, the project will generate insights into the behavior of gradient-guided sampling in high-dimensional spaces. These insights will fill critical gaps in the theoretical underpinnings of probabilistic inference, particularly at the intersection of sampling dynamics and reward propagation. More broadly, this research will further elucidate the nuanced relationship between unnormalized distributions and sampling-based alignment, opening paths for generalizations that may extend to other generative model architectures.

Practically, the framework promises a transformative outcome: enabling the alignment of language models without modifying their weights. By transforming alignment into an efficient sampling procedure, our methodology eliminates the costly fine-tuning processes currently tied to approaches like RLHF. This allows users to dynamically adjust model behavior during inference, tailoring outputs to specific constraints like safety, utility, or task relevance in real-time. The ability to avoid retraining will drastically lower the computational and environmental costs associated with deploying aligned models, while simultaneously enabling rapid adaptation to evolving user requirements.

For the research community, the project lays the foundation for a new line of inquiry focused on harnessing the power of probabilistic inference for real-world applications. It challenges existing paradigms by emphasizing the potential of sampling-based alignment as a scalable, accessible, and flexible alternative to retraining. The results are expected to catalyze the development of new benchmarks and evaluation metrics tailored to reward-guided diffusion processes, while inspiring further exploration of connections between generative models, optimal transport, and reward optimization. These contributions position the proposal as a critical step forward in aligning theoretical progress with practical needs in the rapidly evolving landscape of large language models.
