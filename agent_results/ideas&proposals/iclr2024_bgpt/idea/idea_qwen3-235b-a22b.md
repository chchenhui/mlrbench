## Name of the Idea:  
**"Generalization Bounds via Data-Dependent Dynamical Implicit Bias"**  

## Motivation:  
Existing generalization theories often rely on worst-case assumptions (e.g., uniform convergence) that poorly reflect practical success in deep learning. For instance, overparameterized networks generalize well despite interpolation, contradicting classical bias-variance tradeoffs. This disconnect between theoretical guarantees and empirical performance highlights an urgent need to reconcile implicit bias of optimizers with real-world data properties to explain generalization in modern architectures.  

## Main Idea:  
Propose a framework that characterizes implicit bias as a **data-dependent dynamical system** influenced by optimizer trajectories, neural architectures, and learning rates. Key innovations include:  
1. **Trainable Generalization Metrics**: Learn instance-specific stability measures via meta-learning on datasets, linking gradient dynamics to validation performance.  
2. **Chrono-Flatness**: Quantify how optimizer paths traverse flat/sharp regions of the loss landscape over training time, combining Hessian-based flatness with trajectory sensitivity.  
3. **Architectural Adaptation**: Design loss functions that encourage trajectories to align with optimizer-induced implicit biases (e.g., neural tangent kernel regularization).  

Expected outcomes: Tighter generalization gaps for modern architectures (ResNets, Transformers) and practical "generalization-aware" training schemes that adjust optimization schedules dynamically. This bridges empirical practices (e.g., learning rate warmup) with theoretical grounds.
