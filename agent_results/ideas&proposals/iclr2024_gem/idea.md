# Adaptive Design Space Exploration for Protein Engineering

## Motivation
Protein engineering faces a significant challenge: the vastness of sequence space makes experimental exploration prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Traditional generative ML approaches in biomolecular design often focus on in silico predictions without efficiently guiding experimental resources. This disconnection between computational predictions and wet lab validation creates a bottleneck in developing novel proteins with desired functionalities. A systematic approach that adaptively bridges computational predictions with experimental feedback is urgently needed.

## Main Idea
I propose an adaptive experimental design framework for protein engineering that iteratively refines the exploration of sequence space based on real-time experimental feedback. The system combines generative models with Bayesian optimization to intelligently navigate the design space. Initially, a variational autoencoder generates diverse candidate sequences predicted to have desired properties. Instead of testing all candidates, a subset is selected using uncertainty quantification and diversity metrics. Experimental results from this subset are then used to update the model, refining both the generative process and the selection criteria for the next iteration. This closed-loop system progressively focuses experimental resources on the most promising regions of sequence space while simultaneously improving the underlying model. The approach could reduce experimental costs by 80% compared to conventional screening methods while accelerating discovery of functional proteins.
