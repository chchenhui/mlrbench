**Research Proposal: Adaptive Generative-Experimental Closed-Loop Framework for Efficient Protein Engineering**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Protein engineering is pivotal for advancements in therapeutics, biocatalysis, and synthetic biology. However, the combinatorial explosion of possible amino acid sequences—estimated at $20^{N}$ for a protein of length $N$—makes brute-force experimental exploration infeasible. Current generative machine learning (ML) models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and language models, excel at proposing candidate sequences *in silico* but often fail to account for experimental validation feedback, leading to high false-positive rates and inefficient resource allocation. This disconnect between computational design and experimental workflows slows the discovery of functional proteins.  

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal aims to develop an **adaptive generative-experimental closed-loop framework** that iteratively integrates ML-driven sequence generation with wet lab feedback to optimize protein design. Specific objectives include:  
1. Designing a hybrid ML architecture combining VAEs and Bayesian optimization (BO) to balance exploration of novel sequences with exploitation of high-fitness regions.  
2. Creating an adaptive experimental pipeline that selects sequences for validation using uncertainty quantification and diversity metrics.  
3. Reducing experimental costs by ≥80% compared to traditional high-throughput screening while accelerating the discovery of functional proteins.  
4. Validating the framework on industrially relevant protein engineering tasks, such as enzyme thermostability enhancement.  

**Significance**  
By unifying generative ML with real-world experimental validation, this work will bridge a critical gap in biomolecular design. The proposed framework has the potential to transform protein engineering by enabling rapid, resource-efficient identification of functional variants, with applications in drug development, sustainable chemistry, and bioenergy.

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### **2.1 Overview**  
The framework operates via iterative cycles of computational generation, experimental validation, and model updating (Fig. 1). Key components include:  
1. **Generative Model**: A VAE trained to encode/decode protein sequences and propose candidates.  
2. **Surrogate Model**: A Gaussian process (GP) regressor predicting sequence fitness.  
3. **Adaptive Experimental Design**: A multi-objective acquisition function balancing exploration, exploitation, and diversity.  
4. **Feedback Integration**: Retraining the VAE and GP using experimental data.  

#### **2.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
- **Training Data**: Curate a dataset of protein sequences with experimentally measured properties (e.g., thermostability, catalytic activity) from UniProt, BRENDA, and targeted high-throughput screens.  
- **Embeddings**: Represent sequences as $k$-mer frequencies or residue-level physicochemical descriptors.  
- **Preprocessing**: Normalize fitness scores and augment data via sequence homology-based masking.  

#### **2.3 Generative Model Architecture**  
A **β-VAE** is trained to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO):  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{VAE}} = \mathbb{E}_{q(z|s)}[\log p(s|z)] - \beta D_{\text{KL}}(q(z|s) || p(z)),
$$  
where $s$ is the sequence, $z$ the latent vector, and $\beta$ a hyperparameter controlling latent space regularization. The encoder $q(z|s)$ and decoder $p(s|z)$ use transformer architectures pretrained on protein language models (e.g., ESM-2) to improve sample efficiency.  

#### **2.4 Adaptive Experimental Design Strategy**  
1. **Initial Proposal**: Generate $M=10^4$ candidate sequences using the VAE decoder.  
2. **Surrogate Model**: Train a GP on the latent space to predict fitness $\hat{y}(z)$ for each candidate:  
   $$
   \hat{y}(z) \sim \mathcal{GP}\left(0, k(z, z')\right),
   $$  
   where $k(z, z')$ is an RBF kernel.  
3. **Acquisition Function**: Select $B=50$ sequences per iteration using a **Diversity-Enhanced Expected Improvement (DE-EI)** criterion:  
   $$
   a(z) = \text{EI}(z) + \lambda \cdot \text{Diversity}(z, D),
   $$  
   where $\text{EI}(z) = \mathbb{E}[\max(\hat{y}(z) - y^*, 0)]$ encourages exploitation, and $\text{Diversity}(z, D) = \min_{z_i \in D} ||z - z_i||_2$ ensures coverage of latent space ($D$: previously tested sequences).  

#### **2.5 Feedback Integration and Model Updating**  
- **Experimental Validation**: Test selected sequences using high-throughput assays (e.g., fluorescence-based activity screening).  
- **Retraining**: Update the VAE and GP with new data:  
  - VAE: Retrain on the expanded dataset to refine sequence generation.  
  - GP: Incrementally update hyperparameters via maximum marginal likelihood.  

#### **2.6 Experimental Validation Protocol**  
- **Task**: Engineer a thermostable variant of *Bacillus subtilis* lipase.  
- **Baselines**: Compare against random screening, non-adaptive ML, and state-of-the-art methods (e.g., IsEM-Pro).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **In Silico**: Diversity ($\Delta_{\text{seq}}$, pairwise Levenshtein distance), predicted fitness (Spearman correlation with experimental data).  
  - **Experimental**: Success rate (% of validated candidates with ≥2× wild-type thermostability), iterations to convergence.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

#### **3.1 Anticipated Results**  
1. **Reduced Experimental Burden**: The framework is expected to identify functional sequences in ≤5 iterations (vs. ~20 for random screening), corresponding to an 80% reduction in validated candidates.  
2. **Improved Model Accuracy**: Iterative feedback will increase the Spearman correlation between predicted and experimental fitness from $ρ=0.3$ (initial) to $ρ≥0.7$ (final).  
3. **Case Study Success**: Demonstrate ≥5 thermostable lipase variants with melting temperatures >75°C (vs. 65°C wild-type).  

#### **3.2 Broader Impact**  
- **Biotechnology**: Enable rapid design of enzymes for biomass degradation or CO₂ fixation.  
- **Therapeutics**: Accelerate antibody optimization by focusing experimental efforts on high-likelihood candidates.  
- **Sustainability**: Reduce resource consumption in bioengineering, aligning with green chemistry principles.

### 4. **Conclusion**  
This proposal outlines a systematic approach to unify generative ML with experimental workflows in protein engineering. By addressing key challenges such as false-positive rates and data scarcity through adaptive closed-loop design, the framework promises to significantly enhance the efficiency of biomolecular discovery. Successful implementation will advance both ML methodologies and real-world biological applications, epitomizing the collaborative vision of the GEM workshop.
