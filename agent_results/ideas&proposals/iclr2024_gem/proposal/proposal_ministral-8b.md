# Adaptive Design Space Exploration for Protein Engineering

## Introduction

Protein engineering has emerged as a critical field for addressing medical, industrial, and environmental challenges. However, the vastness of the sequence space presents a formidable barrier to experimental exploration, making it prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Traditional generative machine learning (ML) approaches often focus on in silico predictions without efficiently guiding experimental resources, leading to a significant disconnect between computational predictions and wet lab validations. This bottleneck hinders the development of novel proteins with desired functionalities.

The proposed research aims to address this challenge by developing an adaptive experimental design framework that iteratively refines the exploration of sequence space based on real-time experimental feedback. The system combines generative models with Bayesian optimization to intelligently navigate the design space. Initially, a variational autoencoder (VAE) generates diverse candidate sequences predicted to have desired properties. Instead of testing all candidates, a subset is selected using uncertainty quantification and diversity metrics. Experimental results from this subset are then used to update the model, refining both the generative process and the selection criteria for the next iteration. This closed-loop system progressively focuses experimental resources on the most promising regions of sequence space while simultaneously improving the underlying model. The approach could reduce experimental costs by 80% compared to conventional screening methods while accelerating the discovery of functional proteins.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The research will follow a closed-loop iterative process, combining generative models with Bayesian optimization and experimental feedback. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Initial Sequence Generation**: Use a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate diverse candidate sequences predicted to have desired properties.
2. **Subset Selection**: Select a subset of candidate sequences using uncertainty quantification and diversity metrics.
3. **Experimental Validation**: Conduct experiments on the selected subset to obtain real-time feedback.
4. **Model Update**: Update the generative model and selection criteria based on experimental results.
5. **Iteration**: Repeat steps 2-4 until the desired number of iterations or convergence criteria are met.

### Data Collection

The dataset will consist of:
- **Training Data**: A diverse set of protein sequences with known functionalities.
- **Experimental Data**: Real-time experimental results obtained from the selected subset of candidate sequences.

### Algorithmic Steps

**1. Initial Sequence Generation**

The initial sequence generation step uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate diverse candidate sequences. The VAE is trained on the training data to learn the latent space representation of protein sequences. The encoding and decoding processes are defined as follows:

- **Encoding**: \( z = f(x) \), where \( x \) is the input protein sequence and \( z \) is the latent variable.
- **Decoding**: \( \hat{x} = g(z) \), where \( \hat{x} \) is the generated protein sequence.

The VAE is trained to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO):

\[ \mathcal{L}_{\text{VAE}} = \mathbb{E}_{q(z|x)}[\log p_{\theta}(x|z)] - \text{KL}(q(z|x) || p(z)) \]

**2. Subset Selection**

The subset selection step uses uncertainty quantification and diversity metrics to select a subset of candidate sequences for experimental validation. The uncertainty quantification is performed using the entropy of the posterior distribution:

\[ H(z) = -\sum_{z} p(z|x) \log p(z|x) \]

Sequences with high entropy are selected for validation, as they represent the most uncertain predictions. Diversity metrics, such as the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), are used to ensure the selected subset covers a wide range of the sequence space.

**3. Experimental Validation**

The experimental validation step involves conducting experiments on the selected subset of candidate sequences to obtain real-time feedback. The experimental results are used to update the generative model and selection criteria.

**4. Model Update**

The model update step incorporates the experimental results to refine the generative model and selection criteria. The generative model is retrained using the updated data, and the selection criteria are adjusted based on the experimental outcomes. The retraining process is defined as follows:

\[ \theta = \arg\max_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_{\text{VAE}}(x, z) \]

where \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{VAE}}(x, z) \) is the evidence lower bound (ELBO) incorporating the experimental results.

**5. Iteration**

The iteration step repeats the subset selection, experimental validation, and model update steps until the desired number of iterations or convergence criteria are met. The convergence criteria can be based on the improvement in the success rate of protein design or the reduction in experimental costs.

### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the adaptive experimental design framework will be evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Success Rate**: The proportion of designed proteins that exhibit the desired functionality in experimental validations.
2. **Experimental Costs**: The total number of experiments conducted during the design process.
3. **Computational Costs**: The computational resources required to generate candidate sequences and update the generative model.
4. **Convergence Time**: The time taken to reach convergence or meet the desired number of iterations.

### Experimental Design

The experimental design will involve the following steps:

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare the performance of the adaptive experimental design framework with traditional screening methods.
2. **Parameter Tuning**: Optimize the hyperparameters of the generative model and Bayesian optimization framework.
3. **Case Studies**: Apply the framework to specific protein engineering problems to demonstrate its effectiveness and versatility.
