**1. Title:**

**IntegraGene: A Multi-Modal Foundation Model Integrating Perturbation and Response Data for Enhanced Cell and Gene Therapy Design**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Cell and gene therapies (C&G therapies) represent a paradigm shift in medicine, offering potentially curative treatments for genetic disorders, cancers, and infectious diseases. Modalities like CRISPR-Cas gene editing, mRNA therapeutics, and engineered cell therapies (e.g., CAR-T) hold immense promise. However, their development is fraught with challenges: predicting therapeutic efficacy, ensuring safety by minimizing off-target effects, optimizing delivery to specific cell types, and understanding complex cellular responses to interventions (Task Description; Lit Review #6). These therapies operate within intricate biological systems where genetic perturbations trigger cascades of downstream molecular and phenotypic events across multiple layers – genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and ultimately functional cellular responses.

Current computational approaches often rely on single-modal data (e.g., predicting CRISPR off-target effects based purely on DNA sequence, Lit Review #6). While valuable, these models struggle to capture the holistic dynamics of therapeutic interventions. They often fail to integrate information across different biological scales, limiting their predictive power for complex outcomes like overall therapeutic success or nuanced safety profiles (Research Idea Motivation). For instance, the efficacy of a CRISPR-based therapy depends not only on guide RNA (gRNA) sequence characteristics but also on the chromatin accessibility of the target site, the cell's specific transcriptional state, and its downstream proteomic and phenotypic response – factors requiring multi-modal data integration (Lit Review #5).

Foundation models (FMs), large-scale models pre-trained on broad data, have shown remarkable success in various domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. Their application to biology and drug discovery is a rapidly growing field (Task Description - ML Track; Lit Review #1, #2, #3, #4). Models like MAMMAL demonstrate the potential of multi-modal architectures to learn unified representations across diverse biological entities (Lit Review #1). Leveraging FMs pre-trained on vast biological datasets (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics) and fine-tuning them for specific therapeutic tasks offers a promising path to overcome data scarcity and model complexity challenges in C&G therapy development (Lit Review #2).

**2.2 Research Gap and Proposed Solution**
Despite advancements in biological FMs, a critical gap exists in developing models specifically designed to integrate *causal* perturbation data (e.g., specific gene edits, mRNA delivery) with *multi-modal* downstream readouts (gene expression, protein levels, cell morphology/function) to predict the holistic success of C&G therapies. Existing models often focus on descriptive tasks (e.g., cell type annotation, Lit Review #3) or predict responses to small molecules (Lit Review #2), rather than the complex interventions characteristic of C&G therapies. Furthermore, efficiently leveraging limited, expensive experimental data generated during therapy development remains a key challenge (Lit Review #3 Key Challenges).

To address this gap, we propose **IntegraGene**, a novel multi-modal foundation model architecture. IntegraGene is designed to learn the complex relationships between therapeutic perturbations (e.g., CRISPR gRNA sequences, delivery vector designs, engineered cell constructs) and their multi-faceted biological consequences across transcriptomic, proteomic, and phenotypic levels. It will employ a hybrid architecture combining transformer-based encoders for sequence data and graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecular interaction and regulatory networks, integrated via cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model will be pre-trained on large public biological datasets (e.g., DepMap, GTEx, single-cell atlases) and subsequently fine-tuned using an active learning strategy with targeted, lab-generated perturbation-response data, optimizing the use of experimental resources (Lit Review #10).

**2.3 Research Objectives**
The primary goal of this research is to develop and validate IntegraGene as a predictive tool to accelerate the design and optimization of cell and gene therapies. The specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop the IntegraGene Architecture:** Design and implement a hybrid multi-modal neural network architecture capable of encoding perturbation information (sequences, molecular structures) and multi-modal biological responses (transcriptomics, proteomics, phenomics) and integrating them via cross-modal attention.
2.  **Pre-train IntegraGene:** Pre-train the model on large-scale, publicly available multi-modal biological datasets to learn foundational representations of biological entities and processes relevant to C&G therapies.
3.  **Implement Active Learning Fine-tuning:** Develop and integrate an active learning framework to efficiently fine-tune the pre-trained IntegraGene model using sparsely available, high-value experimental perturbation-response data, maximizing predictive performance while minimizing experimental cost.
4.  **Validate Model Performance:** Rigorously evaluate IntegraGene's predictive capabilities on key C&G therapy design tasks, including gRNA efficacy prediction, off-target effect assessment, prediction of cellular responses (transcriptomic, phenotypic) to gene editing, and potentially cell-type specific delivery optimization. Compare performance against state-of-the-art single-modal and existing multi-modal baseline models.
5.  **Enhance Model Interpretability:** Implement and evaluate interpretability techniques (e.g., attention maps, SHAP, RAG) to provide insights into the model's predictions, elucidating the biological mechanisms linking perturbations to outcomes and addressing a key challenge in complex model deployment (Lit Review Key Challenges #2; Task Description - ML Track).

**2.4 Significance**
This research directly addresses the critical need for advanced AI methods in the development of new drug modalities, particularly C&G therapies (Task Description). By creating a unified model that integrates perturbation data with multi-modal readouts, IntegraGene has the potential to:

*   **Improve Prediction Accuracy:** Offer more accurate predictions of therapeutic efficacy, safety (e.g., off-target effects), and cellular responses compared to single-modal approaches.
*   **Accelerate Therapy Design:** Reduce the time and cost associated with C&G therapy development by enabling *in silico* prediction and prioritization of candidate designs (gRNAs, delivery vectors, cell modifications) before extensive experimental validation.
*   **Optimize Resource Allocation:** Employ active learning to guide experimental efforts towards the most informative data points, making the R&D process more efficient, particularly crucial given the high cost of C&G experiments.
*   **Enhance Biological Understanding:** Provide insights into the complex genotype-phenotype relationships underlying therapeutic interventions through model interpretability.
*   **Contribute to Foundational Models in Biology:** Advance the development and application of large-scale, multi-modal FMs tailored for predictive tasks in the complex domain of therapeutic biology, contributing to the ML track goals outlined in the task description.

Successfully achieving these objectives will bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI and the practical challenges of developing safer, more effective cell and gene therapies, ultimately accelerating their translation to the clinic.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Research Design**
This research employs a computational modeling approach, encompassing model architecture design, large-scale pre-training, active learning-based fine-tuning, and rigorous validation on relevant C&G therapy prediction tasks. The workflow involves data acquisition and preprocessing, model implementation, training, evaluation, and interpretation.

**3.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing**

*   **Public Datasets for Pre-training:** We will leverage large-scale, publicly available datasets, including:
    *   **Genomic/Epigenomic Data:** Reference genomes (e.g., hg38), gene annotations (GENCODE), chromatin accessibility data (e.g., ENCODE ATAC-seq, DNase-seq), and DNA methylation data.
    *   **Transcriptomic Data:** Bulk RNA-seq (e.g., GTEx, TCGA) and single-cell RNA-seq datasets (e.g., Human Cell Atlas, Tabula Sapiens). Perturbation screens like DepMap (CRISPR/RNAi screens with gene expression readouts) will be crucial.
    *   **Proteomic Data:** Protein abundance datasets (e.g., ProteomicsDB, CPTAC) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks (e.g., STRING, BioGRID).
    *   **Molecular Structure Data:** Protein structures (PDB), potentially small molecule data if relevant for delivery systems (PubChem, ChEMBL).
*   **Lab-Generated Data for Fine-tuning:** We will collaborate with experimental labs or utilize existing proprietary/published datasets containing targeted C&G perturbation experiments. This data should ideally provide:
    *   **Perturbation Information:** Details of the intervention, e.g., gRNA sequence, target locus, CRISPR enzyme used, delivery vector characteristics, engineered cell design.
    *   **Multi-Modal Readouts:** Matched readouts from the perturbed cells/tissues, such as:
        *   *Transcriptomics:* scRNA-seq or bulk RNA-seq.
        *   *Proteomics:* Mass spectrometry-based proteomics or targeted protein assays.
        *   *Phenomics:* High-content imaging data capturing morphology, cell viability, specific functional markers (e.g., reporter gene expression), or flow cytometry data.
        *   *Genomics:* Targeted sequencing to measure on-target and off-target editing efficiency.
*   **Data Preprocessing:**
    *   *Sequences (DNA/RNA):* Convert to numerical representations using tokenization (e.g., k-mers) followed by embedding layers or using pre-trained sequence embeddings (e.g., from DNA-BERT).
    *   *Transcriptomic Data:* Normalize counts (e.g., TPM, CPM, log-transformation), perform quality control, and potentially dimensionality reduction (PCA) or use gene embeddings.
    *   *Proteomic Data:* Normalize abundance values, handle missing data.
    *   *Interaction Networks (PPI, GRN):* Represent as adjacency matrices or edge lists. Node features can include gene expression, sequence features, or functional annotations.
    *   *Phenotypic Data:* Extract relevant features from images using pre-trained CNNs or define quantitative metrics from assays/flow cytometry. Normalize scalar features.
    *   **Alignment:** Ensure consistency in gene/protein identifiers across datasets and modalities.

**3.3 Model Architecture: IntegraGene**
IntegraGene will be a multi-modal architecture designed to map perturbation inputs to predicted multi-modal outcomes.

*   **Modality-Specific Encoders:**
    *   *Perturbation Sequence Encoder (e.g., gRNA, mRNA):* A transformer-based model (e.g., BERT-like architecture) to capture sequential dependencies and context. Input: Tokenized sequence. Output: Sequence embedding $E_{seq}$.
    *   *Genomic Context Encoder:* Potentially another transformer or CNN operating on the DNA sequence around the target site, incorporating epigenomic features (e.g., accessibility) as additional channels or embeddings. Output: Context embedding $E_{ctx}$.
    *   *Transcriptomic Encoder:* An MLP or transformer operating on gene expression vectors (post-QC and normalization). Output: Transcriptomic state embedding $E_{tx}$.
    *   *Proteomic/Interaction Encoder:* A Graph Neural Network (GNN), such as Graph Attention Network (GAT) or Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), operating on PPI or gene regulatory networks, using node features like baseline expression or gene properties. Output: Network embedding $E_{net}$. (Reference: Lit Review #7).
    *   *Phenotypic Encoder (Optional/Task-dependent):* An MLP for scalar features or a CNN for imaging data. Output: Phenotypic embedding $E_{ph}$.

*   **Cross-Modal Integration Module:**
    *   We will employ cross-modal attention mechanisms to allow information flow between different modality representations. For example, attention layers can compute relevance scores between perturbation features ($E_{seq}, E_{ctx}$) and cellular state features ($E_{tx}, E_{net}$).
    *   Let $E_i$ and $E_j$ be embeddings from modalities $i$ and $j$. Cross-modal attention can be formulated as:
        $$ \text{Attended}_{i \leftarrow j} = \text{Attention}(Q=f_Q(E_i), K=f_K(E_j), V=f_V(E_j)) $$
        where $f_Q, f_K, f_V$ are learnable projection functions (typically linear layers).
    *   Multiple attention layers or pooling strategies (e.g., concatenation followed by MLP, multi-modal transformers like Perceiver IO) will be explored to fuse the attended representations into a unified multi-modal embedding $E_{fused}$. This approach aligns with the goal of modeling multimodal aspects as per the Task Description (ML Track).

*   **Prediction Heads:**
    *   Task-specific prediction heads (e.g., MLPs, linear layers) will be attached to $E_{fused}$ to predict desired outcomes:
        *   *gRNA Efficacy:* Regression head predicting editing efficiency (e.g., indel frequency).
        *   *Off-Target Score:* Classification head predicting the likelihood of off-target editing at specific genomic sites.
        *   *Transcriptomic Response:* Regression head predicting post-perturbation gene expression profiles (vector output). (Reference: Lit Review #2).
        *   *Phenotypic Outcome:* Classification or regression head predicting cell viability, differentiation state, or functional marker expression.

**3.4 Pre-training Strategy**
The goal is to learn meaningful representations from large, unlabeled/partially labeled public data. We will explore self-supervised learning objectives:

*   **Masked Modeling:** Masking parts of the input sequences (DNA/RNA) or gene expression profiles and training the model to predict the masked portions (inspired by BERT and scBERT).
*   **Contrastive Learning:** Training the model to bring representations of related entities closer (e.g., gene and its corresponding protein, or matched multi-omic profiles from the same cell/sample) while pushing unrelated entities apart. Aligning modalities, similar to BioMedGPT or MAMMAL (Lit Review #1, #4).
*   **Relational Prediction:** Predicting relationships within graphs (e.g., link prediction in PPI networks) or predicting gene expression based on genomic context and epigenomic marks.
*   **Leveraging Perturbation Data:** Using DepMap data to pre-train the model to predict expression changes resulting from known gene knockdowns/knockouts.

Pre-training will be performed on the combined public datasets, aiming for a model that captures fundamental biological knowledge.

**3.5 Fine-tuning with Active Learning**
Given that labeled experimental data for specific C&G therapies is often scarce and expensive to generate, we will implement an active learning (AL) loop for fine-tuning (Reference: Lit Review #10):

1.  **Initialization:** Fine-tune the pre-trained IntegraGene model on an initial small set of available lab-generated perturbation-response data ($D_{train}$).
2.  **Query Strategy:** Use the currently trained model to select the most informative unlabeled data points ($x^*$) from a pool of potential experiments ($D_{pool}$) to be performed next. Selection criteria can include:
    *   *Uncertainty Sampling:* Select points where the model prediction has high uncertainty (e.g., high entropy for classification, high variance for regression).
    *   *Query-by-Committee:* Train multiple models (e.g., using dropout or different initializations) and select points where the committee disagrees most.
    *   *Expected Model Change:* Select points expected to cause the largest gradient updates or changes in the model parameters.
3.  **Experimentation:** Perform the selected experiment(s) ($x^*$) in the lab to obtain the corresponding multi-modal readouts ($y^*$).
4.  **Update:** Add the newly labeled data point $(x^*, y^*)$ to the training set ($D_{train} = D_{train} \cup \{(x^*, y^*)\}$), remove it from the pool, and retrain/update the IntegraGene model.
5.  **Iteration:** Repeat steps 2-4 until a predefined budget (number of experiments) is exhausted or model performance on a validation set converges.

This iterative process aims to achieve high predictive performance with significantly fewer labeled samples compared to random sampling or training only on initially available data, addressing the limited annotated data challenge (Lit Review Key Challenges #3).

**3.6 Experimental Design and Validation**

*   **Tasks for Validation:**
    1.  *CRISPR gRNA On-Target Efficacy Prediction:* Predict editing efficiency based on gRNA sequence, target site sequence, and cellular context (e.g., baseline expression, chromatin accessibility).
    2.  *CRISPR Off-Target Prediction:* Predict the likelihood of editing at potential off-target sites, integrating sequence similarity with cellular context data (Reference: Lit Review #6).
    3.  *Prediction of Cellular Response:* Predict changes in gene expression profiles (transcriptomics) or key protein levels (proteomics) following a specific genetic perturbation (e.g., gene knockout/activation). (Reference: Lit Review #2).
    4.  *Prediction of Phenotypic Outcomes:* Predict functional outcomes like cell viability, differentiation status, or response to subsequent treatments post-gene editing or cell engineering.
*   **Datasets:** Use benchmark datasets where available (e.g., published CRISPR screen results with multi-omic readouts). Create splits for training, validation, and held-out testing. Ensure splits are appropriate for the task (e.g., chromosome-based splits for genomic tasks, cell-type holdouts for generalization checks).
*   **Baselines:** Compare IntegraGene against:
    *   *Single-Modal Models:* Models trained on only one data type (e.g., sequence-only CRISPR predictors like DeepCRISPR, expression-based response predictors).
    *   *Simple Multi-Modal Integration:* Models using simple concatenation of features from different modalities followed by an MLP.
    *   *Existing Multi-Modal FMs:* If applicable and feasible, fine-tune existing models like MAMMAL (Lit Review #1) or scMMGPT-like models (Lit Review #3) on the specific tasks.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   *Regression tasks* (efficacy, expression change): Pearson/Spearman correlation ($r$), Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
    *   *Classification tasks* (off-target prediction, phenotypic state): Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), Area Under the Precision-Recall curve (AUPRC), F1-score, Accuracy.
    *   *Ranking tasks* (prioritizing gRNAs): Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), Precision@k.

**3.7 Interpretability Methods**
To understand *how* IntegraGene makes predictions and gain biological insights, we will apply interpretability techniques:

*   **Attention Weight Analysis:** Visualize cross-modal and self-attention weights to identify which input features (e.g., specific sequence motifs, genes in pathways, cellular states) are most influential for a given prediction.
*   **Gradient-based Methods:** Use methods like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or Integrated Gradients to attribute prediction scores back to input features across different modalities.
*   **In Silico Perturbations:** Systematically alter inputs (e.g., change nucleotides in gRNA, modify baseline expression values) and observe the impact on predictions to understand feature sensitivity.
*   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Explore incorporating RAG by retrieving relevant biological knowledge (e.g., pathway information, known gene functions from literature/databases) based on intermediate model representations to augment predictions and provide contextual explanations (Task Description - ML Track). This directly addresses the interpretability challenge (Lit Review Key Challenges #2).

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**

1.  **A Validated Multi-Modal Foundation Model (IntegraGene):** The primary outcome will be a robust, pre-trained IntegraGene model capable of integrating perturbation data with multi-modal biological readouts specific to C&G therapy contexts.
2.  **State-of-the-Art Predictive Performance:** We expect IntegraGene to outperform existing single-modal and simpler multi-modal baselines in key C&G prediction tasks, demonstrating improved accuracy in forecasting gRNA efficacy, off-target propensities, and cellular responses. Quantitative improvements (e.g., >10% increase in AUPRC for off-target prediction, or >15% reduction in MSE for expression prediction compared to baselines) will be targeted.
3.  **Efficient Fine-tuning Strategy:** Demonstration of the active learning framework's effectiveness in reducing the required number of experiments (e.g., achieving target performance with 30-50% fewer labeled samples compared to random sampling) for fine-tuning on specific therapeutic applications.
4.  **Actionable Biological Insights:** Generation of interpretable outputs that highlight the key features and cross-modal interactions driving therapeutic outcomes. This could reveal novel biological mechanisms or biomarkers relevant to therapy success or failure. For example, identifying specific chromatin states that strongly influence off-target editing for certain gRNAs.
5.  **Open-Source Model and Framework:** We aim to release the model architecture code and potentially pre-trained weights (depending on data usage agreements) to benefit the wider research community.

**4.2 Potential Impact**

*   **Accelerated C&G Therapy Development:** By providing more accurate *in silico* predictions, IntegraGene can significantly shorten the design-build-test cycles in C&G therapy research. Prioritizing the most promising candidates (gRNAs, delivery systems, cell modifications) will reduce experimental costs and timelines, addressing major bottlenecks in the field (Research Idea Impact).
*   **Improved Therapeutic Safety and Efficacy:** Enhanced prediction of off-target effects and efficacy can lead to the design of safer and more potent therapies, increasing the likelihood of successful clinical translation. Understanding cell-type specific responses will aid in tailoring therapies for optimal performance in relevant patient tissues.
*   **Bridging AI and New Modalities:** This project directly contributes to the workshop's goal of applying cutting-edge AI, specifically foundation models and multi-modal learning, to challenges in emerging drug modalities like cell and gene therapy (Task Description).
*   **Advancement of Biological Foundation Models:** The development of IntegraGene will contribute methodologies for building and applying multi-modal FMs in complex biological prediction tasks involving causal interventions, addressing key challenges like data integration, generalization, and interpretability (Lit Review Key Challenges).
*   **Foundation for Future Research:** The IntegraGene framework could be extended to other new modalities mentioned in the task description, such as mRNA vaccine optimization (predicting translation efficiency based on sequence and cellular context) or designing nanoparticle delivery systems (predicting delivery efficiency based on nanoparticle properties and target cell characteristics).

In summary, IntegraGene represents a significant step towards leveraging the power of multi-modal AI to tackle critical challenges in the rapidly evolving field of cell and gene therapy. Its successful development promises to enhance the efficiency, safety, and efficacy of these transformative treatments, contributing substantially to both machine learning methodology and therapeutic innovation.
