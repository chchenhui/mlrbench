**Title:** Context-Aware Foundational Models for Cell-Type Specific CRISPR Guide RNA Design

**Motivation:** Designing effective and specific CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs) is crucial for gene therapies, but off-target effects remain a major hurdle. Current design tools often neglect the complex cellular context (e.g., chromatin accessibility, epigenetic modifications, expressed Cas variants) which significantly impacts gRNA on-target efficiency and off-target propensity in specific cell types.

**Main Idea:** We propose developing a cell-type-aware Foundational Model (FM) by pre-training on vast genomic sequences and integrating multi-modal data, including cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq), methylation patterns, and transcriptomics. The FM will utilize a transformer-based architecture capable of modeling long-range dependencies within the genome. Fine-tuning will occur using experimental on-target/off-target data from diverse cell types. The model will predict gRNA efficiency and specificity conditioned on a target genomic locus *and* a specific cellular context inputted as embeddings derived from relevant epigenetic/transcriptomic data. This approach promises more precise gRNA selection for safer Mland effective cell and gene therapies tailored to target tissues.
