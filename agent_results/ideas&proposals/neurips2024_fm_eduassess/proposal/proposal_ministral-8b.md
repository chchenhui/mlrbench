# SecureED: Generative AI for Detecting and Preventing AI-Generated Responses in Educational Assessments

## Introduction

The integration of large foundation models (LFMs) in educational assessment has the potential to revolutionize test development, evaluation, and administration. However, the misuse of these models by students to generate answers undermines assessment integrity and academic honesty. Current detection tools lack robustness across diverse subjects and question types, risking false accusations and eroding trust. This research addresses the critical need for reliable, adaptable methods to ensure AI accountability in high-stakes educational evaluations.

### Background

Large foundation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various domains, including language understanding, text generation, and multimodal processing. Their application in educational assessment has shown promise in automated scoring, item generation, and adaptive testing. However, the widespread adoption of LFMs in educational assessments is hindered by the lack of robust methods to detect and prevent AI-generated responses.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a contrastive learning framework, named *SecureED*, that leverages LFMs to distinguish AI-generated responses from human-written ones. The framework aims to address the following research questions:

1. How can contrastive learning be effectively employed to detect AI-generated content in educational assessments?
2. What are the key features and patterns that distinguish AI-generated responses from human-written ones across various subjects and question types?
3. How can the robustness of AI-generated text detection be enhanced against evasion tactics, such as paraphrasing and adversarial samples?
4. What are the best practices for integrating AI-generated text detection into existing educational assessment platforms?

### Significance

The development of *SecureED* will contribute to maintaining the integrity of educational assessments, ensuring that students' work is genuinely their own. By providing a reliable and adaptable detection method, *SecureED* will enable the safe adoption of generative AI in educational settings, fostering innovation and improving learning outcomes. Moreover, the research will offer insights into the challenges and opportunities of integrating AI in educational assessments, guiding future developments in this area.

## Methodology

### Research Design

This research will follow a multi-stage approach, comprising data collection, model development, evaluation, and integration. The stages are outlined below:

1. **Data Collection**: A multimodal dataset consisting of human and AI-generated responses will be collected. The dataset will include text, code, and mathematical expressions, covering various subjects and question types.
2. **Model Development**: A contrastive learning framework, *SecureED*, will be developed to distinguish AI-generated responses from human-written ones. The model will be fine-tuned with adversarial samples and domain-specific features, such as reasoning coherence and creativity patterns.
3. **Evaluation**: The performance of *SecureED* will be evaluated using robustness tests against evasion tactics and comparisons to existing detectors, such as GPTZero. Evaluation metrics will include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Integration**: Guidelines for integrating *SecureED* into educational assessment platforms will be developed, ensuring seamless adoption without disrupting workflows.

### Data Collection

The dataset will consist of human and AI-generated responses, including text, code, and mathematical expressions. The dataset will be collected from various sources, such as educational platforms, open datasets, and crowdsourcing. The dataset will be annotated with labels indicating whether the response is human-written or AI-generated.

### Model Development

*SecureED* will be developed using a contrastive learning framework, leveraging LFMs to learn domain-invariant representations. The model will be trained on the multimodal dataset, emphasizing high-order thinking tasks. Fine-tuning will be performed using adversarial samples and domain-specific features to enhance robustness and generalizability.

The contrastive learning objective can be formulated as follows:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \mathbb{I}_{(i \neq j)} \cdot \left[ y_{ij} \cdot \log \left( \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_j))}{\sum_{k=1}^{N} \exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_k))} \right) + (1 - y_{ij}) \cdot \log \left( \frac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^{N} \exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_k))} \right) \right]
$$

where $z_i$ and $z_j$ are the embeddings of the $i$-th and $j$-th samples, respectively, $y_{ij} = 1$ if $i \neq j$ and $y_{ij} = 0$ otherwise, and $\text{sim}(z_i, z_j)$ denotes the similarity between the embeddings.

### Evaluation

The performance of *SecureED* will be evaluated using a set of robustness tests and comparisons to existing detectors. Robustness tests will include:

1. **Evasion Tactics**: Evaluating the model's performance against evasion tactics, such as paraphrasing and adversarial samples.
2. **Domain Generalizability**: Testing the model's ability to generalize across different subjects and question types.
3. **Comparison to Existing Detectors**: Comparing the performance of *SecureED* to existing detectors, such as GPTZero.

Evaluation metrics will include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
$$

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
$$

$$
\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
$$

$$
\text{F1-score} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
$$

where $TP$, $TN$, $FP$, and $FN$ denote true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively.

### Experimental Design

The experimental design will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, including tokenization, normalization, and encoding.
2. **Model Training**: Training *SecureED* on the multimodal dataset, with fine-tuning using adversarial samples and domain-specific features.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of *SecureED* using robustness tests and comparisons to existing detectors.
4. **Model Optimization**: Iteratively improving the model based on evaluation results, including hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.
5. **Model Integration**: Developing guidelines for integrating *SecureED* into educational assessment platforms, ensuring seamless adoption without disrupting workflows.
