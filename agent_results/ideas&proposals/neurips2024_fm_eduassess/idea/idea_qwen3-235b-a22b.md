1. **Title**: **Explainable Framework for Large Foundation Models in Automated Essay Scoring**  
2. **Motivation**: Automated essay scoring using large foundation models (e.g., GPT-4) offers scalability but lacks transparency, raising concerns about fairness and trust in high-stakes educational assessments. Current models act as black boxes, making it difficult to justify scoring decisions, which hinders adoption in institutional settings. Addressing this explainability gap is critical to align AI systems with educational accountability standards and stakeholder expectations.  
3. **Main Idea**: We propose an interpretable framework that augments existing foundation models with a **rationale-guided explanation module** for automated essay scoring. This module generates two types of explanations: (1) *structural rationales* (e.g., highlighting evidence in text linked to scoring rubrics via attention analysis) and (2) *semantic rationales* (e.g., natural language explanations of reasoning steps). The framework will integrate rule-based constraints (e.g., rubric criteria) as guidance during fine-tuning to align model behavior with pedagogical goals. To ensure practicality, the system will be evaluated on (1) correlation with human scorers, (2) stakeholder (educators/policymakers) comprehension of explanations, and (3) robustness against adversarial inputs. This work could enhance trust in AI-driven assessments while empowering educators to refine scoring criteria dynamically, bridging the gap between data-driven AI and human-centric educational values.
