### Title: Enhancing Explainability and Accountability in Large Foundation Models for Educational Assessment

### Motivation:
The integration of large foundation models (LFMs) in educational assessment holds immense promise but is hindered by the lack of explainability and accountability. Stakeholders, including educators, students, and policymakers, need to understand how these models make decisions to ensure fairness and trust. This research aims to address these challenges by developing methods that enhance the transparency and reliability of LFMs in educational assessments.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research will focus on developing and evaluating explainable AI (XAI) techniques tailored to LFMs used in educational assessment. The methodology involves three main steps:

1. **Explainability Techniques**: Implement state-of-the-art XAI methods, such as LIME, SHAP, and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), to interpret the predictions of LFMs. These techniques will be applied to both automated scoring and item generation tasks.

2. **Accountability Frameworks**: Develop a framework that ensures the accountability of LFMs by incorporating fairness metrics and privacy-preserving techniques. This will involve using bias detection algorithms and differential privacy methods to ensure that the assessments are fair and respect user privacy.

3. **Evaluation and Validation**: Conduct extensive evaluations with real-world educational datasets to validate the effectiveness and usability of the proposed methods. Collaborate with educational practitioners to gather feedback and refine the models.

The expected outcomes include:
- Improved transparency in the decision-making processes of LFMs.
- Enhanced trust among stakeholders in the educational ecosystem.
- A framework for ensuring fairness, explainability, and privacy in educational assessments.

The potential impact includes wider adoption of LFMs in educational assessments, leading to more efficient, effective, and equitable educational practices.
