**Title:** Cross-Scale Causal Representation Learning for Cellular Perturbation Effects

**Motivation:** Understanding how molecular-level interventions (e.g., drug treatments, gene edits) causally influence cellular phenotypes is fundamental to biology and medicine. Current representation learning often captures correlations but struggles to disentangle causal relationships across biological scales, hindering reliable prediction of perturbation outcomes.

**Main Idea:** Develop a framework combining causal inference principles with multiscale representation learning. We propose modeling molecular entities (genes, proteins) and cellular features (morphology embeddings from imaging) within a shared latent causal graph. By leveraging interventional data (e.g., measurements before/after specific gene knockouts or drug treatments) and causal discovery algorithms adapted for high-dimensional biological data, the model will learn representations that encode not just associations but hypothesized causal links between molecular states and cellular phenotypes. Evaluation will focus on predicting cellular responses to unseen perturbations and identifying key molecular drivers validated through targeted experiments or literature mining. This approach aims to build more robust and interpretable models of cellular function.
