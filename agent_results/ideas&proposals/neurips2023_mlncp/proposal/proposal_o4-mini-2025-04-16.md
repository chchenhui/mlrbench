1. Title  
Physics-Informed Stochastic Residual Networks for Robust Training on Noisy Analog Accelerators  

2. Introduction  

Background  
Digital accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs have driven remarkable progress in deep learning, but they now approach fundamental limits in energy efficiency, scaling and sustainability. Meanwhile, generative AI workloads continue to explode in compute demand, straining data-center resources and power budgets. Non-traditional computing paradigms—(opto-)analog crossbars, resistive memory arrays and neuromorphic chips—offer orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy and area efficiency. However, their adoption has been hampered by inherent noise, device mismatch, limited bit-depth and nonlinearities. Conventional neural networks, trained and quantized for deterministic digital hardware, suffer drastic accuracy degradation when deployed on analog accelerators. To unlock the promise of these emerging platforms, we need co-designed architectures and training algorithms that not only tolerate but exploit physical noise and hardware idiosyncrasies.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a hybrid, physics-informed training paradigm for deep neural networks on noisy analog hardware, with the following objectives:  
  • Characterize and model analog computing non-idealities (static mismatch, dynamic drift, thermal noise, low bit-depth).  
  • Design stochastic residual layers that embed probabilistic noise models into both forward and backward passes, enabling gradients to flow through hardware-aware pathways.  
  • Introduce a physics-informed regularization term to align weight updates with hardware-achievable dynamics (e.g., asymmetric activations, quantized weight ranges).  
  • Implement a hardware-in-the-loop training framework, combining differentiable surrogate noise models with periodic calibration on real analog devices.  
  • Validate the approach on classification and generative tasks (CIFAR-10, TinyImageNet, energy-based models), benchmarking accuracy, robustness and energy efficiency against digital and existing noisy-training baselines.  

Significance  
Our physics-informed stochastic residual framework promises to:  
  • Achieve digital-comparable accuracy at low precision (4–6 bits) without post-training quantization.  
  • Deliver robustness to time-varying noise and device drift, eliminating costly re-training or calibration in the field.  
  • Exploit hardware noise as a free regularizer for energy-based and equilibrium models, enabling efficient training of novel architectures.  
  • Reduce energy per inference/training step by 5–10× relative to digital GPUs, paving the way for sustainable AI at scale and on edge devices.  

3. Methodology  

3.1 Noise Characterization and Surrogate Modeling  
We begin by modeling key analog non-idealities. Let $W\in\mathbb R^{d_{\text{out}}\times d_{\text{in}}}$ be a weight matrix. We model static device mismatch as  
$$\Delta W_{ij}^{\text{static}}\sim\mathcal N\bigl(0,\sigma_{ij}^{2}\bigr),$$  
where $\sigma_{ij}$ is calibrated per-device. Dynamic noise (thermal, shot noise) is modeled as  
$$\Delta W_{ij}^{\text{dyn}}(t)\sim\mathcal N\bigl(0,\alpha\lvert W_{ij}\rvert\bigr),$$  
where $\alpha$ reflects the device temperature and aging. Nonlinearities and limited precision are captured by a quantization operator $\mathcal Q_b(\cdot)$ mapping real weights to $2^b$ levels. Altogether, an analog forward multiply becomes  
$$\hat y = \mathcal Q_b\bigl((W + \Delta W^{\text{static}} + \Delta W^{\text{dyn}})\,x\bigr) + b\,. $$  

We will calibrate $\{\sigma_{ij}\}$ and $\alpha$ on prototype hardware (e.g.\ memristor crossbars or Intel Loihi arrays) under varying temperature and supply conditions, using statistical measurement and regression. These surrogate parameters feed into our differentiable noise model during training.  

3.2 Stochastic Residual Layer Design  
To integrate noise into the network, we propose Stochastic Residual Layers (SRLs). Let $h^{(l)}$ be the activation at layer $l$. An SRL computes:  
$$h^{(l+1)} = \phi\Bigl(\,\mathcal Q_b\bigl(W^{(l)}h^{(l)} + b^{(l)} + \epsilon^{(l)}\bigr)\Bigr) + h^{(l)}\,, $$  
where $\phi(\cdot)$ is a nonlinear activation (e.g.\ ReLU), and $\epsilon^{(l)}\sim\mathcal N\bigl(0,\beta\lvert W^{(l)}h^{(l)}\rvert\bigr)$ injects data-dependent noise. The residual connection ensures signal propagation even under high noise.  

Backward gradients flow through the reparameterization: $\epsilon^{(l)}=\sqrt{\beta\lvert W^{(l)}h^{(l)}\rvert}\,\xi$ with $\xi\sim\mathcal N(0,1)$, giving unbiased gradient estimates.  

3.3 Physics-Informed Loss Regularization  
We augment the standard task loss $L_{\text{task}}$ (e.g.\ cross-entropy) with a hardware-aware regularizer:  
$$L_{\text{phys}} = \sum_{l}\Bigl\{\lambda_1 \lVert W^{(l)} - \mathrm{proj}_{[-w_{\max},w_{\max}]}(W^{(l)})\rVert_{2}^{2} \;+\;\lambda_2\,\mathrm{KL}\bigl(\mathcal Q_b(W^{(l)})\,\|\,\pi_{\mathrm{hw}}^{(l)}\bigr)\Bigr\}\!, $$  
where $\mathrm{proj}_{[-w_{\max},w_{\max}]}$ clips weights to hardware range, and the KL term aligns the quantized weight distribution with the empirically measured hardware distribution $\pi_{\mathrm{hw}}^{(l)}$. Hyperparameters $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$ control the strength of each penalty.  

Overall training minimizes  
$$L_{\text{total}} = L_{\text{task}} + L_{\text{phys}}\,. $$  

3.4 Hardware-In-The-Loop Training Algorithm  
We propose Algorithm 1 for co-design training.  

Algorithm 1: Physics-Informed Stochastic Residual Training  
Input: dataset $\mathcal D$, initial parameters $\Theta=\{W^{(l)},b^{(l)}\}$, noise model $\{\sigma,\alpha\}$, quantization bit-depth $b$, regularization weights $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$, learning rate $\eta$, hardware calibration interval $T_{\text{cal}}$.  
For epoch $=1,\dots,E$:  
  Shuffle $\mathcal D$, partition into minibatches $\{B_k\}$.  
  For each batch $B_k$:  
    Sample noise $\Delta W,B^{\text{static}},\Delta W^{\text{dyn}}$ and $\epsilon^{(l)}$ per SRL.  
    Compute forward pass with quantization $\mathcal Q_b$ and SRL noise injection.  
    Compute $L_{\text{total}}=L_{\text{task}} + L_{\text{phys}}$.  
    Compute gradients $\nabla_\Theta L_{\text{total}}$ via backpropagation.  
    Update $\Theta \leftarrow \Theta - \eta\,\nabla_\Theta L_{\text{total}}$.  
  If epoch mod $T_{\text{cal}}=0$:  
    Upload current $\Theta$ to analog hardware, measure updated noise statistics $\{\sigma,\alpha\}$, update surrogate model.  
Return final $\Theta^\star$.
