**2. Key Challenges**

1. **Defining and Balancing Multiple Objectives**: In healthcare, objectives such as efficacy, side effects, cost, and quality of life often conflict. Developing models that can effectively balance these competing objectives remains a significant challenge.

2. **Eliciting Accurate Preferences**: Collecting reliable preference data from clinicians and patients is difficult due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of healthcare decisions. Ensuring that these preferences accurately reflect the trade-offs considered in practice is essential.

3. **Data Scarcity and Quality**: Healthcare data is often limited, noisy, and heterogeneous. Developing reinforcement learning algorithms that can learn effectively from such data is a persistent challenge.

4. **Interpretability and Trust**: For clinical decision support systems to be adopted, they must be interpretable and trusted by healthcare professionals. Ensuring that reinforcement learning models provide transparent and justifiable recommendations is crucial.

5. **Generalization Across Patient Populations**: Healthcare interventions must be personalized yet generalizable across diverse patient populations. Developing models that can adapt to individual patient needs while maintaining robustness is a key challenge.
