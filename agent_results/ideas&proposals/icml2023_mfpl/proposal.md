### Research Proposal

# **A Multi-Objective Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning Framework for Personalized Clinical Decision Support**

## **1. Introduction**

### **Background**  
Clinical decision-making often involves reconciling multiple, conflicting objectives. Physicians must optimize for treatment efficacy, minimize side effects, reduce financial costs, and consider quality-of-life outcomes—goals that cannot be easily reduced to a single numerical reward. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, which rely on explicitly defined scalar rewards, struggle to model this complexity, leading to policies that fail to align with human medical reasoning. Preference-based reinforcement learning (PBRL) addresses this limitation by leveraging relative feedback (e.g., rankings of state-action sequences) to learn reward functions aligned with expert preferences. However, most PBRL methods assume a single underlying objective, oversimplifying the nuanced, multi-objective nature of healthcare decisions. Existing approaches, such as the Preference Transformer [1] and fairness-induced PBRL [2], have demonstrated promise in modeling individual preferences and balancing competing objectives but remain constrained by their reliance on centralized or static reward trade-offs. Similarly, offline PBRL frameworks [3] and human-in-the-loop systems [4] offer data-efficient and clinician-centered alternatives but lack explicit mechanisms to represent multi-objective Pareto fronts or adapt to personalized priorities.  

### **Research Objectives**  
This project proposes a novel framework for **Multi-Objective Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning (MOPBRL)** in healthcare. The core innovation is the integration of preference elicitation (over trajectory pairs) with multi-objective optimization to learn a Pareto front of treatment policies. The objectives of this research include:  
1. Developing an algorithmic pipeline that infers latent weights for healthcare objectives (e.g., efficacy, side effects) from clinician preferences over treatment trajectories.  
2. Optimizing a set of policies representing distinct trade-offs between competing objectives for chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).  
3. Incorporating individual patient preferences (e.g., tolerance for side effects) into the learned reward function to enable personalized treatment recommendations.  
4. Validating the framework on simulated and real-world healthcare datasets to ensure clinical relevance and robustness.  

### **Significance**  
The proposed framework directly addresses critical gaps in both RL theory and healthcare practice:  
- **Clinician-Centered Design**: By abstracting away explicit reward weights and focusing on relative trajectories, it aligns with how physicians naturally evaluate trade-offs.  
- **Personalization**: Patient-specific factors (e.g., comorbidities, socioeconomic status) can modulate policy trade-offs, enabling adaptive decision support.  
- **Interpretable AI**: Explicitly maintaining a Pareto front preserves transparency, allowing clinicians to inspect and refine policy recommendations.  
- **Theoretical Advancement**: Extends PBRL to multi-objective settings, integrating ideas from risk-aware [5], fairness-focused [2], and data-pooling frameworks [10].  

This work will bridge the disconnect between complex clinical reasoning and existing RL paradigms, offering a scalable solution for personalized, preference-driven treatment optimization.  

## **2. Methodology**

### **2.1 Problem Formulation**  
We model healthcare decisions as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** with state space $ \mathcal{S} $, action space $ \mathcal{A} $, and transition function $ P(s' | s, a) $. The reward function is decomposed into multiple conflicting objectives:  
$$
R(s, a) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i f_i(s, a),
$$  
where $ f_i(s, a) $ represents features like efficacy (e.g., blood glucose reduction), side effect severity (e.g., hypoglycemia risk), and cost (e.g., drug price), and $ w_i \in [0,1] $ are latent weights satisfying $ \sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i = 1 $.  

Our goal is to learn a distribution over $ \mathbf{w} = [w_1, \dots, w_k] $, reflecting clinician priorities, and generate a set of Pareto-optimal policies $ \boldsymbol{\pi}_{\mathbf{w}} $ that clinicians can select for individual patients.  

### **2.2 Preference Data Collection**  
We collect pairwise preferences from clinicians by presenting them with trajectories $ \tau_1 $ and $ \tau_2 $ of treatment plans for specific cases (e.g., a patient’s glucose trends under varying insulin doses). For each pair, clinicians select the preferred trajectory. Mathematically, this forms a dataset:  
$$
\mathcal{D} = \left\{ \left(\tau_1^{(t)}, \tau_2^{(t)}, r^{(t)} \right) \right\}_{t=1}^{N},
$$  
where $ r^{(t)} = 1 $ if $ \tau_1^{(t)} $ is preferred, and $ 0 $ otherwise.  

To ensure robust elicitation:  
- **Diverse Trajectories**: Generate $ \tau_1^{(t)} $ and $ \tau_2^{(t)} $ using stochastic policies (e.g., epsilon-greedy) from an initial reward-agnostic model and simulate outcomes via a pharmacokinetic/disease model.  
- **Clinician Engagement**: Conduct iterative feedback rounds, refining trajectory pairs based on earlier choices to target uncertainty regions [4].  
- **Offline Data Integration**: Augment preference data with historical EHR (Electronic Health Record) sequences from chronic disease patients to improve reward function generalization [3, 10].  

### **2.3 Preference-Based Reward Function Learning**  
We infer the weight vector $ \mathbf{w} $ by maximizing the likelihood of observed preferences. Using the **Bradley-Terry** model, preferences are encoded as:  
$$
p\left( \tau_1 \succ \tau_2 \right) = \sigma\left( R(\tau_1) - R(\tau_2) \right),
$$  
where $ \sigma(\cdot) $ is the logistic function and $ R(\tau) = \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) $ is the cumulative reward for trajectory $ \tau $.  

**Algorithmic Steps**:  
1. **Initialize Reward Model**: Train a neural network $ \hat{R}(\cdot; \mathbf{w}) $ to parameterize the reward function as a linear combination of basis functions $ f_i $.  
2. **Preference Likelihood Estimation**:  
   - For each trajectory pair $ (\tau_1, \tau_2) $, compute $ R(\tau_1) $ and $ R(\tau_2) $ using the current $ \mathbf{w} $.  
   - Update $ \mathbf{w} $ via gradient ascent to minimize the cross-entropy loss:  
     $$
     \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}) = -\sum_{t=1}^{N} r^{(t)} \log \sigma\left( \hat{R}(\tau_1^{(t)}; \mathbf{w}) - \hat{R}(\tau_2^{(t)}; \mathbf{w}) \right) + (1 - r^{(t)}) \log \sigma\left( \hat{R}(\tau_2^{(t)}; \mathbf{w}) - \hat{R}(\tau_1^{(t)}; \mathbf{w}) \right).
     $$  
3. **Bayesian Weight Inference**: Model $ \mathbf{w} $ as a distribution using **maximum entropy inverse RL**, where clinicians are assumed to choose $ \tau_1 \succ \tau_2 $ with probability proportional to $ \exp(\lambda R(\tau_1)) $, with $ \lambda > 0 $ controlling decision entropy [4]. This allows uncertainty quantification in weight estimates.  

### **2.4 Multi-Objective Policy Optimization**  
The learned reward function enables multi-objective policy search via a **Pareto front** approach, where each policy corresponds to a unique $ \mathbf{w} $ prioritization.  

**Framework**:  
- **Population-Based Training**: Maintain a population of policies $ \boldsymbol{\pi}_j $, each parameterized by distinct weights $ \mathbf{w}_j $.  
- **Pareto-Frontier Construction**: Use **Genetic Algorithms (GAs)** in the weight space to evolve $ \mathbf{w}_j $, ensuring diversity. For each $ \mathbf{w}_j $, train a policy $ \boldsymbol{\pi}_j $ via **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** [1], balancing exploration/exploitation trade-offs.  
- **Interactive Refinement**: Clinicians select subsets of $ \boldsymbol{\pi}_j $ they find most effective. This feedback updates the posterior over $ \mathbf{w} $, refining the Pareto front iteratively with **Bayesian Active Learning**.  

This approach builds on the **Max-Min MO-RL** philosophy [7] but introduces dynamic weight learning through comparative feedback rather than static fairness constraints.  

### **2.5 Personalization with Patient Data**  
While the clinician-derived Pareto front provides a menu of trade-offs, patient-specific preferences (e.g., prioritizing quality of life over aggressive treatment) are incorporated via meta-learning.  

**Implementation**:  
1. Pretrain $ \boldsymbol{\pi}_j $ on aggregated clinician data.  
2. Introduce a **contextual preference encoder**: For patient features $ c \in \mathbb{R}^d $ (e.g., age, adherence history), output $ \mathbf{w}_{\text{patient}} = \text{MLP}(c) $.  
3. Fine-tune the base policy using the patient’s $ \mathbf{w}_{\text{patient}} $ as starting weights, adapting the treatment plan to individual priorities.  

This mirrors the **Adaptive Alignment** framework [5], which adjusts policies dynamically, but integrates patient data directly through the reward function.  

### **2.6 Experimental Design and Metrics**  

#### **Datasets**:  
- **Simulated Diabetes Management**: Use a diabetes progression model (e.g., UVa/Padova simulator) with actions (insulin doses) and states (blood glucose, time-of-day, meal intake).  
- **Real-World Hypertension Data**: Extract longitudinal EHR data from electronic databases (e.g., MIMIC-III) for patients on antihypertensive medications.  

#### **Baselines**:  
- **Single-Objective RL (SOTA-RL)**: Train a conventional RL agent with handcrafted weights for objectives.  
- **Traditional Multi-Objective RL (MO-RL)**: Use scalarization with fixed weights from [7].  
- **Offline Preference Aggregation (OPA)**: Apply [3] to learn a reward from offline data without clinician feedback.  

#### **Evaluation Metrics**:  
1. **Hypervolume (HV)**: Measures the volume of the objective space dominated by the Pareto front.  
   $$  
   \text{HV} = \text{Volume} \left( \bigcup_{\boldsymbol{\pi} \in \text{Pareto Front}} [0, \text{Efficacy}(\boldsymbol{\pi})] \times [0, \text{Cost}(\boldsymbol{\pi})]^\complement \right),
   $$  
   where the complement ensures lower cost translates to higher HV.  

2. **Average Reward for Clinically Aligned Trajectories**: Compare performance across objectives (e.g., mean glucose control, number of side effects).  

3. **Fairness Index (FI)**: Adapt the fairness measure from [2] to quantify equity between objectives:  
   $$  
   \text{FI} = \log\left( \Delta \right) \quad \text{where} \quad \Delta = \min_i \max_j \left( \frac{f_j(s, a)}{f_i(s, a)} \right).  
   $$  

4. **Clinician Satisfaction**: Conduct a survey where healthcare professionals rate the interpretability and alignment of generated policies with standard practices.  

5. **Patient-Specific Adaptation**: For each patient in a test cohort, measure:  
   - **Personalized Efficacy (PE)**: Deviation from clinician’s general Pareto front when adapting to patient preferences.  
   - **Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (CER)**: Ratio of efficacy improvement to associated cost.  

#### **Hyperparameter Tuning**:  
- Use **cross-validation** with 80% train, 20% test splits.  
- For offline data integration, experiment with confidence intervals $ \delta \in [0.1, 0.9] $ in [3] to balance bias-variance trade-offs.  

#### **Computational Resources**:  
- Deploy policies using **PPO** with a batch size of 512, $ \gamma = 0.95 $ (discount factor), and 100 training episodes.  
- Preference Transformer-like models utilize **5-layer Transformers** with multi-head attention to capture temporal dependency in clinician feedback.  

#### **Ethical Considerations**:  
- Clinician preferences are collected with IRB approval, ensuring anonymized and voluntary participation.  
- Patient data abides by HIPAA/GDPR regulations during pretraining.  

## **3. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

### **Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Framework Validity**: Demonstrate that clinicians can iteratively shape a robust Pareto front of policies using only pairwise comparisons, even with heterogeneous patient cohorts.  
2. **Improved Multi-Objective Trade-Offs**: Achieve higher hypervolume scores than fixed-scalarization baselines by 15–20% on simulated diabetes data.  
3. **Patient Personalization**: Show statistically significant improvements in adherence and satisfaction metrics (via CER and PE) when integrating patient context.  
4. **Efficient Preference Elicitation**: Prove that 20–30 clinicians can converge to a stable $ \mathbf{w} $-distribution within 5–10 feedback rounds, reducing elicitation burden.  

### **Long-Term Impact**  
1. **Clinical Decision Support Tools**: Enable systems that balance multiple objectives transparently via Pareto-efficient policies, increasing clinician trust and adoption.  
2. **Multi-Objective Preference Modeling**: Advance PBRL theory by extending fairness-aware [2] and data-pooling [10] methods to high-dimensional, sequential decision-making tasks.  
3. **Personalized Treatment Optimization**: Provide a template for integrating patient preferences into RL frameworks, critical for domains like oncology or chronic pain management.  
4. **Broader AI Alignment**: Show how PBRL can address multi-stakeholder trade-offs in healthcare, where clinicians, patients, and payers have competing priorities.  

This proposal directly tackles challenges outlined in the literature: balancing multiple objectives [1], ensuring fairness [2], mitigating data scarcity [3], increasing interpretability [4], and generalizing across patients [5]. By merging these dimensions into a unified MOPBRL framework, we aim to set a benchmark for preference-driven healthcare AI.
