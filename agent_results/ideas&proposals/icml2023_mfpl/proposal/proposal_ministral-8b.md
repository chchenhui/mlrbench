Multi-Objective Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning for Healthcare: A Framework for Personalized Clinical Decision Support

## 2. Introduction

### Background

Healthcare decisions often involve multiple conflicting objectives, such as efficacy, side effects, cost, and quality of life. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches struggle in healthcare because numerical reward functions are difficult to define precisely and often fail to capture the complex trade-offs made by physicians. Preference-based learning offers a more intuitive approach for capturing clinician expertise, but most current methods assume a single underlying objective, limiting their applicability to healthcare's inherently multi-objective nature.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a novel framework that combines multi-objective optimization with preference-based reinforcement learning (MOPBRL) for clinical decision support. This framework aims to maintain a Pareto front of policies representing different trade-offs between competing healthcare objectives. By presenting clinicians with pairs of treatment trajectories and asking for their preferences, we can learn a distribution over the weights of different objectives that best explains clinical decision-making. The resulting system will recommend personalized treatment policies aligned with both individual patient priorities and physician expertise.

### Significance

This research has the potential to create more transparent, personalized clinical decision support systems that align with how physicians actually reason about complex healthcare decisions. By leveraging preference-based learning, we can address the challenges of defining and balancing multiple objectives, eliciting accurate preferences, and ensuring data scarcity and quality. Moreover, our approach aims to enhance interpretability and trust in clinical decision support systems, facilitating their adoption by healthcare professionals.

## 3. Methodology

### Research Design

Our research design involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect preference data from clinicians and patients regarding treatment trajectories for chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. This data will be used to train and evaluate our MOPBRL framework.

2. **Preference Modeling**: Develop a preference model that can learn a distribution over the weights of different objectives from the collected preference data. This model will be based on the Preference Transformer architecture, which captures temporal dependencies in human decision-making.

3. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Implement a multi-objective optimization algorithm that maintains a Pareto front of policies representing different trade-offs between competing healthcare objectives. The algorithm will use the learned preference distribution to optimize the objectives.

4. **Policy Recommendation**: Generate personalized treatment policies aligned with individual patient priorities and physician expertise by selecting the most suitable policy from the Pareto front.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of our MOPBRL framework using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We will also assess the interpretability and trustworthiness of the recommended policies through user studies with healthcare professionals.

### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Preference Data Collection**:
   - Collect preference data from clinicians and patients using pairwise comparisons of treatment trajectories.
   - Represent each treatment trajectory as a vector of features, such as efficacy, side effects, cost, and quality of life.

2. **Preference Modeling**:
   - Train a Preference Transformer model on the collected preference data to learn a distribution over the weights of different objectives.
   - Use the learned distribution to model the preferences of clinicians and patients.

3. **Multi-Objective Optimization**:
   - Define a set of competing objectives, such as efficacy, side effects, cost, and quality of life.
   - Implement a multi-objective optimization algorithm, such as the NSGA-II algorithm, to maintain a Pareto front of policies.
   - Use the learned preference distribution to weight the objectives and optimize the Pareto front.

4. **Policy Recommendation**:
   - Select the most suitable policy from the Pareto front based on the preferences of the individual patient.
   - Generate a personalized treatment policy aligned with both individual patient priorities and physician expertise.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the performance of the MOPBRL framework using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Assess the interpretability and trustworthiness of the recommended policies through user studies with healthcare professionals.

### Mathematical Formulations

#### Preference Modeling

Let $\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]$ be a treatment trajectory with $n$ features representing efficacy, side effects, cost, and quality of life. Let $\mathbf{w} = [w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n]$ be the weight vector for the objectives. The preference model learns a distribution $P(\mathbf{w} \mid \mathbf{x})$ over the weights of different objectives from the collected preference data.

#### Multi-Objective Optimization

Let $\mathbf{y} = [y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_m]$ be the vector of objective values for a treatment trajectory $\mathbf{x}$. The multi-objective optimization algorithm aims to find a Pareto front of policies that optimizes the weighted sum of objectives:

$$
\max_{\mathbf{y}} \sum_{i=1}^{m} w_i y_i
$$

where $w_i$ is the weight of the $i$-th objective, and $y_i$ is the value of the $i$-th objective for the treatment trajectory $\mathbf{x}$.

### Experimental Design

We will evaluate our MOPBRL framework on medication dosing for chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. The experimental design will include the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare a dataset of treatment trajectories for diabetes and hypertension, including features such as efficacy, side effects, cost, and quality of life.

2. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare the performance of our MOPBRL framework with baseline methods, such as single-objective RL and preference-based RL without multi-objective optimization.

3. **User Studies**: Conduct user studies with healthcare professionals to assess the interpretability and trustworthiness of the recommended policies.

4. **Generalization**: Evaluate the generalization of our MOPBRL framework across diverse patient populations by testing it on different datasets.
