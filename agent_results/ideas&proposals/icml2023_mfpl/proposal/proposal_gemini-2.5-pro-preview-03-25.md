## **Research Proposal**

**1. Title:** **MOPBRL-H: Multi-Objective Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning for Personalized Clinical Decision Support in Chronic Disease Management**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1. Background**
Artificial intelligence (AI) holds immense promise for transforming healthcare, particularly in clinical decision support (CDS). Reinforcement learning (RL), a paradigm focused on learning optimal sequential decisions through interaction, is a natural fit for managing chronic conditions where treatment strategies evolve over time based on patient responses. However, standard RL approaches face significant hurdles in healthcare. Defining a precise numerical reward function that encapsulates the complex, often conflicting, objectives inherent in clinical practice – such as maximizing treatment efficacy, minimizing side effects, controlling costs, and optimizing patient quality of life – is notoriously difficult and subjective (Sutton & Barto, 2018; Gottesman et al., 2019). Assigning fixed weights to these objectives often fails to capture the nuanced, patient-specific trade-offs that clinicians make daily.

Preference-based learning (PbL) has emerged as a powerful alternative, leveraging the observation that humans are often better at expressing relative preferences between outcomes than assigning absolute numerical scores (Fürnkranz & Hüllermeier, 2010). This approach has shown remarkable success, most notably in aligning large language models using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Christiano et al., 2017) and has found applications in diverse fields (Wirth et al., 2017). In healthcare, PbL offers the potential to directly learn from clinician expertise by asking them to compare treatment scenarios or outcomes, thereby implicitly capturing their underlying judgment criteria.

However, existing preference-based RL (PBRL) methods often assume a single, latent utility function is being optimized (Christiano et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2023). This assumption is incongruent with the reality of healthcare, which is fundamentally multi-objective. Clinicians constantly navigate trade-offs: aggressively treating a condition might improve a primary outcome but induce severe side effects; a less effective but cheaper medication might be preferred for resource-constrained settings. Ignoring this multi-objective nature limits the applicability and realism of current PBRL techniques in clinical settings. Recent work has started exploring multi-objective RL (MORL) combined with preferences (Li & Guo, 2024; Zhou et al., 2023; Siddique et al., 2023; Park et al., 2024), but a comprehensive framework tailored specifically to the complexities and demands of healthcare, particularly chronic disease management, is still lacking. Challenges remain in effectively eliciting and modeling multi-objective preferences, ensuring fairness and robustness, and learning efficiently from potentially limited and noisy clinical data (Lit Review Challenges #1, #2, #3).

**2.2. Research Objectives**
This research aims to bridge the gap between the multi-objective reality of clinical decision-making and the potential of preference-based learning. We propose to develop and evaluate a novel framework, **M**ulti-**O**bjective **P**reference-**B**ased **R**einforcement **L**earning for **H**ealthcare (MOPBRL-H).

The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop a Novel MOPBRL Framework for Healthcare:** Design an integrated framework that combines MORL techniques for handling multiple conflicting objectives with PBRL for learning from clinician preferences over treatment trajectories.
2.  **Learn Clinician Preference Distributions:** Develop methods to infer not a single reward function, but a *distribution* over the weights of different clinical objectives, reflecting the uncertainty and variability in clinician preferences and the trade-offs they implicitly make.
3.  **Generate Pareto-Optimal Policy Sets:** Utilize the learned preference distribution to guide the MORL algorithm towards finding a diverse set of Pareto-optimal treatment policies, representing clinically relevant trade-offs between objectives.
4.  **Personalize Policy Recommendations:** Design mechanisms within the framework to recommend policies from the Pareto set that align with the learned clinician preference model, potentially allowing for further personalization based on specific patient contexts or stated priorities.
5.  **Validate the Framework in Simulated Clinical Environments:** Implement and evaluate the MOPBRL-H framework on simulated chronic disease management tasks (e.g., Type 1 Diabetes glucose control, hypertension management), demonstrating its ability to learn meaningful trade-offs and generate clinically plausible policies compared to baseline methods.

**2.3. Significance**
This research holds significant potential for advancing both AI in healthcare and the field of preference-based learning.

*   **Clinically Aligned CDS:** By learning directly from clinician preferences over realistic scenarios, MOPBRL-H aims to produce CDS systems whose recommendations are better aligned with actual clinical reasoning and practice, potentially increasing trust and adoption (Lit Review Challenge #4).
*   **Personalized Medicine:** The framework's ability to represent multiple objectives and learn preference distributions facilitates the generation of treatment strategies tailored to individual patient needs and clinician judgment, moving beyond one-size-fits-all approaches (Chen et al., 2022; Harland et al., 2024).
*   **Addressing Multi-Objective Complexity:** It tackles the inherent multi-objective nature of healthcare decisions head-on, providing a principled way to manage trade-offs without requiring explicit, and often unobtainable, numerical reward specifications.
*   **Methodological Advancements:** This work will contribute novel algorithms at the intersection of MORL and PBRL, particularly in learning distributions over objective weights from preferences and using these distributions for policy optimization. This addresses an important gap identified in recent literature (e.g., adapting single-objective preference models like Kim et al., 2023 or Zhou et al., 2023 for multi-objective weight inference).
*   **Bridging Theory and Practice:** Directly addressing the call of the workshop, this research connects theoretical advances in PBRL and MORL to the practical, high-impact domain of clinical decision support, tackling real-world system needs.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1. Problem Formulation: Multi-Objective MDP (MOMDP)**
We model the clinical decision-making process for chronic disease management as a Multi-Objective Markov Decision Process (MOMDP). An MOMDP is defined by the tuple $\mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, P, \mathbf{R}, \gamma)$, where:
*   $\mathcal{S}$ is the state space, representing patient physiological status, treatment history, relevant biomarkers, etc. (e.g., blood glucose levels, HbA1c, blood pressure, current medication doses, time since last dose).
*   $\mathcal{A}$ is the action space, representing clinical interventions (e.g., adjust insulin dose, change medication type, recommend lifestyle modification).
*   $P: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{S} \rightarrow [0, 1]$ is the transition probability function, describing the patient's state dynamics under different actions. This may be learned from data or based on physiological models.
*   $\mathbf{R}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ is the vector-valued reward function, where $d$ is the number of objectives (e.g., $R_1$ for glucose control, $R_2$ for hypoglycemia avoidance, $R_3$ for minimizing medication burden). Crucially, the components $R_i$ are assumed to be known or estimable objectively (e.g., based on glucose values), but the relative importance (weights) assigned to them by clinicians is unknown.
*   $\gamma \in [0, 1)$ is the discount factor.

A policy $\pi: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ maps states to actions. The goal in MORL is typically to find the set of Pareto-optimal policies. A policy $\pi$ dominates $\pi'$ if its expected discounted vector return $\mathbf{V}^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_\pi [\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t \mathbf{R}(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) | s_0=s]$ is better or equal in all objectives and strictly better in at least one objective. The Pareto front consists of the value vectors of non-dominated policies.

Standard MORL often finds the Pareto front by optimizing scalarized value functions $V_w^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_\pi [\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t w^T \mathbf{R}(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) | s_0=s]$ for different weight vectors $w \in \Delta^d = \{ w \in \mathbb{R}^d | w_i \ge 0, \sum w_i = 1 \}$. Our key challenge is that $w$ is unknown and represents the clinician's subjective preferences.

**3.2. Proposed MOPBRL-H Framework**
Our framework iteratively learns a distribution over clinician preference weights $w$ and uses this distribution to guide the search for relevant Pareto-optimal policies.

**Step 1: Initialization**
*   Initialize a set of candidate policies, potentially covering a range of initial weight vectors (e.g., corners of the weight simplex $\Delta^d$).
*   Initialize a prior distribution over the weight vector $w$, $P_0(w)$. This could be uniform over $\Delta^d$ or informed by preliminary domain knowledge.

**Step 2: Trajectory Generation and Preference Elicitation**
*   Select a set of diverse policies $\{\pi_k\}$ from the current estimated Pareto set (or policies exploring specific regions of the weight space).
*   For representative patient states $s$, simulate treatment trajectories $\tau = (s_0, a_0, \mathbf{r}_0, s_1, a_1, \mathbf{r}_1, ...)$ by executing these policies, where $\mathbf{r}_t = \mathbf{R}(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$.
*   Present pairs of trajectories $(\tau_i, \tau_j)$ to a (simulated or real) clinician and query for their preference: $\tau_i \succ \tau_j$ (prefer $\tau_i$), $\tau_j \succ \tau_i$ (prefer $\tau_j$), or $\tau_i \sim \tau_j$ (indifferent/equal preference). Trajectory pairs should be chosen strategically to be maximally informative about the underlying weights, potentially focusing on pairs where policies yield significantly different outcomes across objectives. We can incorporate techniques for efficient preference elicitation (e.g., active querying). We can also leverage recent work allowing for equal preferences (Liu et al., 2024).

**Step 3: Preference Modeling and Weight Distribution Update**
*   **Preference Model:** We model the probability of preferring trajectory $\tau_i$ over $\tau_j$ given a weight vector $w$ using a suitable preference model, such as the Bradley-Terry model extended to trajectory values. The value of a trajectory $\tau$ under weights $w$ is $V_w(\tau) = \sum_{t=0}^{|\tau|-1} \gamma^t w^T \mathbf{r}_t$. Then, the probability of preference can be modeled as:
    $$ P(\tau_i \succ \tau_j | w) = \sigma(V_w(\tau_i) - V_w(\tau_j)) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-(V_w(\tau_i) - V_w(\tau_j)))} $$
    More complex preference models, potentially capturing non-linearities or temporal dependencies using architectures like the Preference Transformer (Kim et al., 2023), can also be incorporated here to model $P(\tau_i \succ \tau_j | \theta)$, where $\theta$ implicitly depends on $w$.
*   **Weight Distribution Update:** Let $\mathcal{D} = \{(\tau_i^{(k)}, \tau_j^{(k)}, p^{(k)})\}_{k=1}^N$ be the accumulated preference dataset, where $p^{(k)}$ indicates the preference outcome for the $k$-th pair. We update the distribution over weights $P(w)$ using Bayesian inference:
    $$ P(w | \mathcal{D}) \propto P(\mathcal{D} | w) P_0(w) $$
    where $P(\mathcal{D} | w) = \prod_{k=1}^N P(\text{preference}^{(k)} | \tau_i^{(k)}, \tau_j^{(k)}, w)$. The posterior $P(w | \mathcal{D})$ captures the distribution of weights consistent with the observed clinician preferences. We can use sampling methods (e.g., MCMC) or variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution.

**Step 4: Multi-Objective Policy Optimization**
*   The learned weight distribution $P(w|\mathcal{D})$ guides the MORL algorithm to focus on relevant parts of the Pareto front. We can employ several strategies:
    *   **Expected Scalarization:** Optimize policies based on the expected scalarized return: $\mathbb{E}_{w \sim P(w|\mathcal{D})} [V_w^\pi(s)]$.
    *   **Sampling-based MORL:** Sample multiple weight vectors $w^{(m)} \sim P(w|\mathcal{D})$ and run parallel MORL updates (e.g., using Multi-Objective Q-learning or policy gradient methods like Multi-Policy Trust Region Optimization) for each sampled $w^{(m)}$ to update the set of Pareto-optimal policies. This naturally generates a diverse set reflecting the uncertainty in $w$.
    *   **Distributionally Robust Optimization:** Adapt methods like Zhan et al. (2023) to find policies robust to the uncertainty in $w$ as represented by $P(w|\mathcal{D})$.
*   The policy optimization can be performed in an online fashion (if interaction is possible) or offline using existing datasets (leveraging techniques from Zhan et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022 requires adapting them to the multi-objective preference setting). Fairness considerations (Siddique et al., 2023; Park et al., 2024) and risk awareness (Zhao et al., 2024) can be integrated into the optimization objective.

**Step 5: Iteration and Recommendation**
*   Repeat Steps 2-4, iteratively refining the weight distribution and the Pareto set of policies. The human-in-the-loop nature allows for adaptive alignment (Li & Guo, 2024; Harland et al., 2024).
*   For recommendation, present the clinician with a selection of policies from the final Pareto set, highlighting their trade-offs across objectives. The system can suggest policies whose associated weight vectors have high probability under the learned posterior $P(w|\mathcal{D})$, or allow the clinician to explore the Pareto front interactively.

**3.3. Data Collection and Simulation Environment**
*   **Simulation:** We will utilize or adapt existing physiological simulators for chronic diseases:
    *   **Type 1 Diabetes:** The UVA/Padova T1D simulator (Man et al., 2014) or simglucose (github) provides a validated environment for testing glucose control strategies. State: glucose levels, insulin-on-board, meal intake. Actions: insulin bolus/basal adjustments. Objectives: maximize time-in-range (e.g., 70-180 mg/dL), minimize hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL), minimize hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dL), minimize total daily insulin dose.
    *   **Hypertension:** Develop or adapt a simpler cardiovascular model. State: blood pressure (systolic/diastolic), heart rate, current medications/doses. Actions: adjust medication dose, switch medication class. Objectives: maintain target blood pressure range, minimize side effects score (e.g., dizziness, fatigue - potentially modeled stochastically based on dose/class), minimize medication cost.
*   **Preference Simulation:** Clinician preferences will be simulated using a ground-truth weight vector $w^*$ (or a distribution) unknown to the MOPBRL-H agent. Preferences between trajectory pairs $(\tau_i, \tau_j)$ will be generated based on $P(\tau_i \succ \tau_j | w^*) = \sigma(V_{w^*}(\tau_i) - V_{w^*}(\tau_j))$, potentially adding noise to simulate human inconsistency.
*   **Offline Data (Potential Extension):** We may explore using retrospective Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data. This requires addressing challenges of real-world data (missingness, noise, confounding) and adapting MOPBRL-H for offline learning (Zhan et al., 2023). This would likely involve learning dynamics models and deriving objective vector rewards from the available data.

**3.4. Experimental Design and Validation**
We will conduct experiments to evaluate MOPBRL-H against relevant baselines:

*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **Single-Objective PBRL (SO-PBRL):** Standard PBRL assuming a single reward function (e.g., Christiano et al., 2017), implicitly averaging objectives or using a fixed, predefined weight vector.
    2.  **Standard MORL (Fixed Weights):** MORL algorithms (e.g., MO-Q-learning) using several fixed, pre-defined weight vectors (e.g., uniform, corners of the simplex) without learning from preferences.
    3.  **Average Reward RL:** Single-objective RL optimizing a simple average of the normalized objective rewards.
    4.  **Direct Preference Optimization (MODPO):** Adapt RL-free methods like Zhou et al. (2023) if applicable to the stateful RL setting.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Preference Prediction Accuracy:** On a held-out set of preference queries, measure how accurately the model learned from MOPBRL-H predicts clinician preferences compared to baselines.
    2.  **Weight Distribution Recovery (Simulation):** In simulation with a known $w^*$, measure the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or Wasserstein distance between the learned posterior $P(w|\mathcal{D})$ and the ground-truth $w^*$ (or distribution).
    3.  **Pareto Front Quality:**
        *   **Hypervolume Indicator:** Measure the volume of the objective space dominated by the obtained Pareto front approximation relative to a reference point.
        *   **Coverage and Spacing:** Assess how well the generated set of policies covers the true Pareto front and how evenly spaced they are.
        *   **Alignment with True Weights:** Evaluate if the generated Pareto front includes policies close to the optimal policy for the true (simulated) weight vector $w^*$.
    4.  **Simulated Clinical Outcomes:** Execute the policies learned by MOPBRL-H (e.g., the policy corresponding to the mean/mode of $P(w|\mathcal{D})$ or a diverse set from the Pareto front) in the simulator over extended periods and evaluate their performance based on the defined objectives (e.g., average time-in-range, frequency of adverse events, average medication cost/burden). Compare these outcomes against baselines.
    5.  **Sample Efficiency:** Measure how quickly (in terms of preference queries or environment interactions) MOPBRL-H converges to high-quality policies compared to baselines.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1. Expected Outcomes**
*   **A Novel MOPBRL-H Framework:** A well-defined and implemented framework integrating MORL and PBRL specifically designed for healthcare decision support.

*   **Open-Source Contribution (Potential):** Release of the MOPBRL-H codebase and potentially the simulation environments to facilitate further research.
*   **Insights into Clinical Trade-offs:** The learned weight distributions may offer insights into how clinicians implicitly value different outcomes in specific contexts.

**4.2. Impact**
This research is expected to have a significant impact:

This could lead to improved management of chronic diseases, better patient outcomes, and reduced healthcare costs.
*   **Machine Learning Methodology:** Contribute novel techniques at the intersection of MORL, PBRL, Bayesian inference, and healthcare AI. The methods for learning weight distributions and guiding MORL via preferences could be applicable in other domains with multi-objective decision-making and subjective human feedback (e.g., robotics, finance, personalized recommendations).
*   **Addressing Key Challenges:** Directly tackle identified challenges in the field, including balancing multiple objectives (#1), effective preference elicitation (#2), interpretability/trust (#4), and personalization (#5) in healthcare AI.
*   **Workshop Contribution:** Align strongly with the workshop's goals by bringing together MORL, PBRL, and healthcare communities, and connecting theoretical advancements (preference learning, multi-objective optimization) to a critical real-world application.

In conclusion, the proposed MOPBRL-H framework offers a principled and promising approach to developing next-generation clinical decision support systems that are data-driven, preference-aware, multi-objective, and ultimately, better aligned with the goals of effective and personalized patient care.
