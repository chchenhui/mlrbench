Title: Active Preference-Guided Multi-Objective Optimization

Motivation:  
Real-world systems—robotic manipulators, autonomous vehicles, design engines—must balance conflicting objectives, yet traditional Pareto-front methods overwhelm users with options and ignore individual priorities. Integrating human preference feedback directly into the optimization loop can focus search on solutions that matter.

Main Idea:  
We introduce AP-MOO, an Active Preference-Guided Multi-Objective Optimizer that couples an evolutionary Pareto-based search with a Gaussian‐process surrogate over the objective-weight simplex. At each generation, AP-MOO (1) samples candidate solutions on the Pareto front; (2) selects the most informative pair to present to a user via active learning (maximizing expected information gain about their latent utility); (3) updates the GP model with the binary comparison; and (4) biases the next generation toward high-utility regions. We will evaluate AP-MOO on benchmark functions and a robotic grasp‐planning task balancing stability, speed, and energy. Expected outcomes include faster convergence to user‐preferred optima with fewer queries, leading to personalized, efficient decision‐support in design, robotics, and beyond.
