# Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Graph Networks for Unified Scene Representation in Autonomous Driving

## 1. Introduction

Autonomous driving technology stands at a critical juncture where modular perception, prediction, and planning systems have demonstrated significant advancements but continue to face challenges in seamlessly integrating these components. Current approaches typically segment the autonomous driving pipeline into distinct modules, each with specialized representations: perception systems generate 3D bounding boxes or segmentation maps, prediction modules forecast trajectories, and planning systems convert these inputs into executable actions. This modularity, while offering engineering advantages, creates bottlenecks where errors propagate through the system and contextual information is lost at module boundaries.

The fragmentation of scene representation across these modules presents a fundamental limitation. Static elements (roads, buildings, traffic signs) and dynamic actors (vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists) are often processed through separate pipelines with different representation formats, limiting the system's ability to reason about their interdependencies. This separation artificially constrains the autonomous vehicle's understanding of the environment, particularly in complex urban scenarios where the interactions between infrastructure and agents critically influence driving decisions.

Recent research has explored various approaches to address these limitations. Occupancy-based unified scene representations (Li et al., 2024; Min et al., 2023) offer volumetric understanding but often lack explicit relational modeling. Vectorized approaches (Jiang et al., 2023) efficiently represent map elements and agent trajectories but may struggle to capture the full spectrum of interactions. Graph-based methods (Jia et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2019) have shown promise in modeling interactions among traffic participants but typically focus exclusively on dynamic agents without incorporating static elements.

This research proposes a novel Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Graph (HSG) framework that serves as a unified representation bridging perception, prediction, and planning. The HSG integrates both static infrastructure and dynamic agents within a shared geometric space while explicitly modeling their spatiotemporal relationships and interactions. By leveraging the expressive power of graph neural networks and temporal modeling techniques, the HSG representation aims to enable joint optimization across traditionally separate autonomous driving tasks.

The objectives of this research are to:
1. Develop a hierarchical graph structure that unifies static and dynamic elements of driving scenes
2. Design specialized neural network architectures that operate on this representation for joint perception-prediction tasks
3. Implement learning strategies that enhance generalization to unseen environments and interaction scenarios
4. Evaluate the proposed approach on multiple autonomous driving benchmarks to demonstrate its efficacy compared to modular systems

The significance of this research extends beyond technical improvements in prediction accuracy. A unified scene representation has the potential to fundamentally change how autonomous driving systems are designed, moving away from rigid modular architectures toward more integrated approaches that better reflect the interconnected nature of driving tasks. Additionally, by explicitly modeling the relationships between scene elements, the proposed approach offers improved interpretability and the potential for safer decision-making in critical scenarios.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Graph Structure

The proposed Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Graph (HSG) representation consists of a multi-layered graph structure that captures both the physical composition of the driving scene and the evolving dynamics of agents within it. The graph $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{A})$ comprises:

- A node set $\mathcal{V} = \{v_i\}_{i=1}^N$ representing distinct elements in the scene
- An edge set $\mathcal{E} = \{e_{ij}\}$ capturing relationships between nodes
- An adjacency tensor $\mathcal{A}$ encoding the connection strengths across time

Nodes are organized in a hierarchical structure with three primary levels:
1. **Infrastructure level**: Represents static elements including road segments, lane markings, traffic signals, and permanent structures
2. **Agent level**: Represents dynamic participants including vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists
3. **Interaction level**: Represents higher-order interactions between agents and infrastructure

Each node $v_i$ is associated with a feature vector $\mathbf{h}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ that encodes relevant attributes. For infrastructure nodes, these features include geometric properties, semantic type, and regulatory information. For agent nodes, features include position, velocity, acceleration, orientation, and object type. The interaction nodes aggregate information from connected infrastructure and agent nodes to represent complex relationships.

The edges $e_{ij}$ establish connections between nodes based on spatial proximity, functional relationships, and interaction potential. We define multiple edge types:
- Physical connectivity (e.g., lane adjacency)
- Spatial proximity (distance-based connections)
- Functional relationships (e.g., vehicle-to-lane assignments)
- Temporal connections (linking nodes across time steps)

The adjacency tensor $\mathcal{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N \times T}$ encodes the strength of connections between nodes across $T$ time steps, with elements $a_{ij}^t$ representing the connection strength between nodes $i$ and $j$ at time $t$.

### 2.2 Multi-Modal Data Integration

The HSG framework integrates data from multiple sensor modalities, including LiDAR, cameras, and historical motion data. The sensor data processing pipeline consists of:

1. **Initial Perception**: Raw sensor data is processed to extract preliminary object detections, road features, and scene elements
2. **Feature Extraction**: For each detected element, a feature extractor network computes a rich feature representation
3. **Graph Construction**: Detected elements are mapped to graph nodes with corresponding features
4. **Feature Fusion**: For elements detected across multiple modalities, feature fusion is performed via:

$$\mathbf{h}_i = \sum_{m=1}^M w_m \mathbf{h}_i^m$$

where $\mathbf{h}_i^m$ is the feature vector from modality $m$ and $w_m$ are learnable fusion weights.

The spatial alignment between modalities is maintained through a shared coordinate system, ensuring consistent positioning of graph nodes regardless of the detection source.

### 2.3 Dynamic Graph Neural Network Architecture

To process the HSG representation, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) architecture that captures evolving spatiotemporal relationships. The DGNN consists of:

1. **Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Layers**: Process information within each level of the hierarchy

$$\mathbf{h}_i^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)} + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \frac{1}{c_{ij}}\mathbf{U}^{(l)}\mathbf{h}_j^{(l)}\right)$$

where $\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}$ is the feature of node $i$ at layer $l$, $\mathcal{N}(i)$ is the neighborhood of node $i$, $c_{ij}$ is a normalization constant, and $\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$ and $\mathbf{U}^{(l)}$ are learnable parameters.

2. **Cross-hierarchy Attention Mechanisms**: Enable information flow between hierarchy levels

$$\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp\left(\text{LeakyReLU}\left(\mathbf{a}^T[\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i \| \mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_j]\right)\right)}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \exp\left(\text{LeakyReLU}\left(\mathbf{a}^T[\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i \| \mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_k]\right)\right)}$$

$$\mathbf{h}_i^{\prime} = \sigma\left(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \alpha_{ij}\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_j\right)$$

where $\alpha_{ij}$ are attention coefficients between nodes $i$ and $j$, and $\mathbf{a}$ is a learnable attention vector.

3. **Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)**: Model the evolution of node features over time

$$\mathbf{h}_i^{t+1} = \text{TCN}([\mathbf{h}_i^{t-k}, \mathbf{h}_i^{t-k+1}, ..., \mathbf{h}_i^t])$$

where $\mathbf{h}_i^t$ represents the features of node $i$ at time $t$, and $k$ is the temporal receptive field.

4. **Edge Update Module**: Dynamically updates edge weights based on node interactions

$$a_{ij}^{t+1} = \sigma\left(\mathbf{W}_e[\mathbf{h}_i^t \| \mathbf{h}_j^t \| a_{ij}^t]\right)$$

where $a_{ij}^t$ is the edge weight between nodes $i$ and $j$ at time $t$.

The complete DGNN processes the input HSG through multiple layers, updating node features, edge weights, and temporal connections to capture the evolving scene dynamics.

### 2.4 Joint Task Learning

The HSG representation enables joint learning of multiple autonomous driving tasks. The primary tasks addressed include:

1. **Object Detection and Tracking**: Identifying and tracking dynamic agents in the scene
2. **Scene Flow Estimation**: Computing the 3D motion field of the environment
3. **Trajectory Prediction**: Forecasting future positions of dynamic agents
4. **Interaction Modeling**: Predicting how agents will interact with each other and the infrastructure

These tasks share the HSG representation and DGNN backbone but employ task-specific decoder heads. The multi-task learning objective is:

$$\mathcal{L} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{det} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{flow} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{traj} + \lambda_4 \mathcal{L}_{inter} + \lambda_5 \mathcal{L}_{reg}$$

where $\lambda_i$ are task weighting coefficients, and the individual loss components are:

- Detection loss: $\mathcal{L}_{det} = \mathcal{L}_{cls} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{box}$
- Flow estimation loss: $\mathcal{L}_{flow} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \|\hat{\mathbf{f}}_i - \mathbf{f}_i\|_2$
- Trajectory prediction loss: $\mathcal{L}_{traj} = \frac{1}{N_a T_f} \sum_{i=1}^{N_a} \sum_{t=1}^{T_f} \|\hat{\mathbf{p}}_i^{t+t_0} - \mathbf{p}_i^{t+t_0}\|_2$
- Interaction loss: $\mathcal{L}_{inter} = -\frac{1}{|\mathcal{E}|} \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{E}} y_{ij} \log(\hat{y}_{ij}) + (1-y_{ij})\log(1-\hat{y}_{ij})$
- Regularization loss: $\mathcal{L}_{reg} = \|\Theta\|_2^2$

where $\hat{\mathbf{f}}_i$ and $\mathbf{f}_i$ are predicted and ground truth flow vectors, $\hat{\mathbf{p}}_i^{t+t_0}$ and $\mathbf{p}_i^{t+t_0}$ are predicted and ground truth positions, $\hat{y}_{ij}$ and $y_{ij}$ are predicted and ground truth interaction labels, and $\Theta$ represents the model parameters.

### 2.5 Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning

To enhance generalization to unseen scenarios and reduce dependency on labeled data, we incorporate self-supervised contrastive learning. The approach consists of:

1. **Data Augmentation**: Creating augmented versions of the input graph
   - Spatial perturbations of node positions
   - Feature masking and noise addition
   - Subgraph sampling
   - Temporal shuffling within constrained windows

2. **Contrastive Objective**: Maximizing similarity between augmented versions of the same scene while minimizing similarity between different scenes

$$\mathcal{L}_{contrastive} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{z}_i, \mathbf{z}_i^+)/\tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{z}_i, \mathbf{z}_i^+)/\tau) + \sum_{j \neq i}\exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{z}_i, \mathbf{z}_j)/\tau)}$$

where $\mathbf{z}_i$ and $\mathbf{z}_i^+$ are embeddings of two augmented versions of the same scene, $\text{sim}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is a similarity function (cosine similarity), and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.

3. **Pre-training and Fine-tuning**: The model is first pre-trained with the contrastive objective and then fine-tuned on the joint task learning objective.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

The proposed Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Graph representation and accompanying Dynamic Graph Neural Network architecture are expected to yield several significant outcomes:

1. **Improved Perception-Prediction Performance**: By jointly modeling static and dynamic elements and their interactions, we anticipate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, particularly in complex urban environments with multiple interacting agents. Specifically, we expect:
   - 10-15% reduction in trajectory prediction error (ADE/FDE) compared to modular baselines
   - 5-8% improvement in detection and tracking metrics (AP, MOTA) through context-aware processing
   - Enhanced performance in challenging scenarios involving multiple interacting agents and complex infrastructure

2. **Efficient Representation Learning**: The unified representation is expected to achieve better performance with fewer parameters compared to separate modules for each task. This efficiency stems from:
   - Shared feature extraction across multiple tasks
   - Knowledge transfer between related tasks
   - Elimination of redundant computations at module boundaries
   - Reduced information loss between processing stages

3. **Enhanced Generalization**: The hierarchical structure and self-supervised learning components should enable better generalization to unseen environments and interaction scenarios. We expect:
   - Robust performance on out-of-distribution test sets
   - Improved handling of rare event types
   - Better adaptation to new geographic regions with limited training data

4. **Interpretable Scene Understanding**: The explicit modeling of relationships between scene elements offers improved interpretability compared to end-to-end black-box approaches:
   - Graph structure provides visibility into which elements influence predictions
   - Attention weights reveal the importance of different interactions
   - Hierarchical organization aligns with human understanding of driving scenes

Beyond these technical outcomes, the research has broader implications for autonomous driving technology:

1. **Architectural Evolution**: This work promotes a shift from rigid modular architectures toward more integrated approaches that better reflect the interconnected nature of driving tasks. This architectural evolution could inspire new system designs that balance the benefits of modularity with the advantages of joint optimization.

2. **Safety Advancements**: By explicitly modeling interactions and their evolution over time, the approach provides a foundation for safety-critical decision making that considers the interdependencies between agents and infrastructure. This explicit consideration of relationships could lead to more cautious behavior in ambiguous situations.

3. **Computational Efficiency**: The unified representation potentially reduces the overall computational footprint compared to running multiple specialized neural networks, making it more feasible to deploy sophisticated AI systems in vehicles with limited computing resources.

4. **Dataset Utilization**: The self-supervised learning component enables more efficient use of unlabeled data, potentially reducing the amount of expensive annotation required for developing autonomous driving systems.

This research addresses several key challenges in autonomous driving research, including the integration of heterogeneous scene elements, efficient modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics, and the development of representations that support both accuracy and interpretability. By advancing unified scene representations, this work contributes to the long-term goal of developing autonomous vehicles that can safely navigate complex environments through a comprehensive understanding of their surroundings.
