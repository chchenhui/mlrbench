Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Graphs for Unified Scene Representation in Autonomous Driving

## 2. Introduction

### Background
Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sophisticated perception and prediction systems to navigate complex urban environments. However, the current modular approach often leads to fragmented representations for static objects and moving entities, hindering the system's ability to generalize across complex interactions. Existing methods typically silo representations, resulting in error propagation and inefficiency. This research aims to address these challenges by proposing a hierarchical spatiotemporal graph as a unified scene representation.

### Research Objectives
The primary objectives of this research are:
1. Develop a hierarchical spatiotemporal graph that integrates static physical elements (roads, infrastructure) and dynamic actors (vehicles, pedestrians).
2. Use adaptive edge weights to encode interactions, enabling joint perception-prediction-learning via dynamic graph neural networks.
3. Model trajectory evolution using temporal convolutional networks.
4. Employ self-supervised contrastive learning to enhance generalization across unseen scenarios.
5. Integrate 3D LiDAR, camera, and motion data into this structure to jointly optimize object detection, scene flow estimation, and multi-horizon trajectory prediction.

### Significance
The proposed hierarchical spatiotemporal graph offers several significant advantages:
- Improved accuracy in complex urban scenes.
- Reduced dependency on labeled datasets.
- Better robustness to edge cases.
- Enhanced safety-critical planning by explicitly modeling actor interactions.
- Advancement of end-to-end driving systems.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Collection
The dataset will consist of 3D LiDAR, camera, and motion data collected from real-world driving scenarios. The data will be annotated with ground truth labels for objects, their trajectories, and interactions. The dataset will cover a variety of urban environments, including different weather conditions and traffic densities.

### 3.2 Representation Learning
#### 3.2.1 Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Graph
The hierarchical spatiotemporal graph will be constructed as follows:
- **Nodes**: Represent static objects (roads, buildings) and dynamic agents (vehicles, pedestrians).
- **Edges**: Connect nodes based on spatial and temporal interactions. The edge weights will be adaptive and updated based on the interaction strength.
- **Layers**: The graph will have multiple layers to capture different levels of abstraction. The top layer will represent high-level interactions, while lower layers will capture fine-grained details.

#### 3.2.2 Dynamic Graph Neural Networks
The dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) will be used to learn the graph structure and node features. The DGNNs will update the graph topology and node features iteratively based on the adaptive edge weights. The DGNNs will be trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning objectives.

#### 3.2.3 Temporal Convolutional Networks
The temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) will be used to model the trajectory evolution of dynamic agents. The TCNs will capture both spatial and temporal dependencies, enabling accurate trajectory prediction.

#### 3.2.4 Self-supervised Contrastive Learning
Self-supervised contrastive learning will be employed to enhance the model's generalization capabilities. The model will be trained to predict future states based on past observations, with the goal of minimizing the contrastive loss between positive and negative samples.

### 3.3 Integration of Multi-modal Data
The 3D LiDAR, camera, and motion data will be integrated into the hierarchical spatiotemporal graph as follows:
- **3D LiDAR**: Used to create a 3D point cloud representation of the environment, serving as the foundation for the graph structure.
- **Camera**: Used to provide RGB information for object detection and segmentation.
- **Motion**: Used to track the trajectories of dynamic agents, updating the graph topology and node features.

### 3.4 Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the proposed method will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Object Detection Accuracy**: Measured using Intersection over Union (IoU).
- **Scene Flow Estimation Accuracy**: Measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Trajectory Prediction Accuracy**: Measured using Mean Average Precision (mAP).

### 3.5 Experimental Design
The experiment will be conducted as follows:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The raw data will be preprocessed to extract relevant features and remove noise.
2. **Model Training**: The hierarchical spatiotemporal graph will be trained using the DGNNs, TCNs, and contrastive learning objectives.
3. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model will be evaluated on a held-out test set using the aforementioned metrics.
4. **Model Comparison**: The proposed method will be compared with state-of-the-art baselines using the same evaluation metrics.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### 4.1 Improved Accuracy in Complex Urban Scenes
The hierarchical spatiotemporal graph is expected to improve the accuracy of object detection, scene flow estimation, and trajectory prediction in complex urban scenes. The unified representation will enable the model to capture interactions between static and dynamic elements more effectively, leading to better performance.

### 4.2 Reduced Dependency on Labeled Datasets
The self-supervised contrastive learning approach will reduce the model's dependency on labeled datasets. By learning from unlabeled data, the model will be able to generalize to unseen scenarios more effectively.

### 4.3 Better Robustness to Edge Cases
The proposed method will be robust to edge cases, such as rare or unexpected driving situations. The hierarchical spatiotemporal graph will enable the model to adapt to new scenarios by updating the graph topology and node features based on the adaptive edge weights.

### 4.4 Enhanced Safety-Critical Planning
The explicit modeling of actor interactions in the hierarchical spatiotemporal graph will enhance safety-critical planning. The model will be able to make more informed decisions by considering the interactions between agents, leading to safer and more reliable planning.

### 4.5 Advancement of End-to-End Driving Systems
The proposed method will contribute to the advancement of end-to-end driving systems. By integrating perception, prediction, and planning into a unified framework, the system will be able to make more accurate and efficient decisions, improving overall performance.

## Conclusion
This research aims to address the challenges of integrating fragmented perception and prediction systems in autonomous driving by proposing a hierarchical spatiotemporal graph as a unified scene representation.
