**Key Challenges**:

1. **Integration of Static and Dynamic Elements**: Developing a unified representation that effectively combines static infrastructure and dynamic agents remains complex, as it requires capturing diverse interactions and dependencies.

2. **Scalability and Computational Efficiency**: Hierarchical spatiotemporal graphs can become computationally intensive, especially in dense urban environments with numerous interacting entities, posing challenges for real-time processing.

3. **Data Fusion from Multiple Sensors**: Integrating data from 3D LiDAR, cameras, and motion sensors into a cohesive graph structure is challenging due to differences in data modalities, resolutions, and potential sensor noise.

4. **Generalization to Unseen Scenarios**: Ensuring that the model generalizes well to novel and complex driving situations, including rare or edge cases, is difficult and requires robust training strategies.

5. **Safety-Critical Decision Making**: Accurately modeling interactions among multiple agents to inform safe and reliable planning decisions is crucial, yet challenging due to the unpredictable nature of human behavior and the need for precise predictions.
