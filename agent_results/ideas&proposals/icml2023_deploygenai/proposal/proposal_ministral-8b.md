# SAFEGEN: Interpretable Safety Checks for Generative Medical Imaging

## Introduction

### Background

Generative models have shown remarkable success in various domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. However, their deployment in high-stakes areas such as healthcare and biology presents significant challenges. One of the primary concerns is the generation of unrealistic or artifact-ridden images that could mislead diagnostic AI or clinicians, posing safety hazards. Current quality checks often rely on manual inspections or lack fine-grained interpretability regarding the reasons behind an image's unsuitability.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop SAFEGEN, a framework for automatically assessing the safety and realism of generated medical images (e.g., CT, MRI) with interpretable feedback. Specifically, SAFEGEN aims to:

1. **Integrate Anomaly Detection**: Utilize an anomaly detection module trained on real medical images to flag potentially unsafe or artifact-prone regions.
2. **Provide Interpretability**: Incorporate an interpretability component (e.g., Grad-CAM, SHAP) to provide visual heatmaps highlighting the features contributing to the anomaly score.
3. **Enhance Trust and Safety**: Allow developers and clinicians to understand failure modes and verify generated data quality before use, thereby enhancing trust and safety in deployment.

### Significance

The development of SAFEGEN addresses critical gaps in the current state of generative AI deployment in medical imaging. By providing fine-grained, interpretable feedback, SAFEGEN helps in identifying and mitigating potential safety hazards, thereby improving the reliability and trustworthiness of generated medical images. This research contributes to the broader goal of advancing the safe and effective deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains.

## Methodology

### Research Design

SAFEGEN consists of three main components: an anomaly detection module, an interpretability module, and a feedback mechanism. The following sections detail each component and the overall experimental design.

### Anomaly Detection Module

The anomaly detection module is designed to identify potentially unsafe or artifact-prone regions in generated medical images. This module leverages a pre-trained model on real medical images to detect deviations from normal patterns.

#### Training and Architecture

The anomaly detection module is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a U-Net architecture, which is well-suited for medical image segmentation tasks. The model is trained on a large dataset of real medical images to learn the normal patterns and variations in these images.

#### Mathematical Formulation

The loss function for training the anomaly detection module can be formulated as follows:

\[ L_{\text{anomaly}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{M} (y_{ij} - \hat{y}_{ij})^2 \]

where \( y_{ij} \) represents the ground truth pixel value at position \( (i, j) \) and \( \hat{y}_{ij} \) represents the predicted pixel value by the model.

### Interpretability Module

The interpretability module provides visual explanations for the anomaly detection results. This module uses techniques such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to highlight the features contributing to the anomaly score.

#### Grad-CAM

Grad-CAM is a technique that generates a class activation map by computing the gradients of the target class with respect to the feature maps of the last convolutional layer.

\[ \text{Grad-CAM}(x) = \sum_{i} \alpha_i \cdot \phi_i(x) \]

where \( \alpha_i \) are the gradients of the target class with respect to the feature maps \( \phi_i(x) \).

#### SHAP

SHAP values provide a way to explain the prediction of a machine learning model by attributing the output to the input features. For the anomaly detection module, SHAP values can be used to explain the anomaly score by attributing it to specific regions or features in the image.

### Feedback Mechanism

The feedback mechanism combines the outputs of the anomaly detection and interpretability modules to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the generated images. This mechanism generates visual heatmaps highlighting the regions contributing to the anomaly score and provides a confidence score for each region.

#### Visualization

The feedback mechanism visualizes the anomaly detection results using heatmaps generated by Grad-CAM and SHAP. These heatmaps are overlaid on the generated images to provide a clear indication of the unsafe or artifact-prone regions.

### Experimental Design

The evaluation of SAFEGEN involves assessing its ability to detect known artifacts and correlating its interpretations with radiologist assessments. The experimental design includes the following steps:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Collect a dataset of real medical images containing known artifacts and anomalies. This dataset will be used to train and evaluate the anomaly detection module.
2. **Model Training**: Train the anomaly detection module on the real medical images dataset.
3. **Image Generation**: Generate medical images using a generative model and apply the anomaly detection module to these images.
4. **Interpretability Evaluation**: Use the interpretability module to generate heatmaps for the detected anomalies and compare these heatmaps with radiologist assessments.
5. **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the performance of SAFEGEN using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for anomaly detection, and interpretability metrics such as SHAP values and Grad-CAM overlap.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

1. **SAFEGEN Framework**: A comprehensive framework for automatically assessing the safety and realism of generated medical images with interpretable feedback.
2. **Interpretable Anomaly Detection**: Fine-grained explanations for the reasons behind the detection of unsafe or artifact-prone regions in generated images.
3. **Enhanced Trust and Safety**: Improved trust and safety in the deployment of generative models in medical imaging by providing clear and understandable feedback to developers and clinicians.

### Impact

The development of SAFEGEN has the potential to significantly impact the field of medical imaging by addressing the challenges associated with the deployment of generative models. By providing interpretable safety checks, SAFEGEN enhances the reliability and trustworthiness of generated medical images, leading to better diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. Furthermore, the framework contributes to the broader goal of advancing the safe and effective deployment of generative AI in high-stakes domains, including healthcare and biology.

This proposal outlines a detailed plan for developing SAFEGEN, a framework for interpretable safety checks in generative medical imaging. By addressing the challenges of deploying generative models in medical imaging, SAFEGEN aims to enhance trust and safety in the deployment of these models, ultimately improving patient outcomes and advancing the field of medical imaging.
