# Generative AI Safety Monitoring Framework (GAISMOF)

## Motivation
As generative AI systems become increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains like healthcare and biology, their safety becomes paramount. Current approaches to safety monitoring are often reactive rather than proactive, implemented as afterthoughts rather than core system components. This research addresses the critical need for continuous, adaptive safety monitoring systems that can identify emergent risks in generative AI applications as they evolve in production environments, particularly when serving diverse user populations with varying needs and vulnerabilities.

## Main Idea
GAISMOF is a comprehensive framework for continuous safety monitoring of deployed generative AI systems. It integrates three novel components: (1) A stratified sampling mechanism that ensures adequate monitoring across diverse user demographics and usage patterns; (2) A dual-mode monitoring system combining automated detectors with human oversight, featuring specialized adversarial probing teams; and (3) A feedback integration pipeline that enables rapid response to detected safety issues. The system maintains a taxonomic risk registry that evolves with discovered vulnerabilities. Unlike static evaluation benchmarks, GAISMOF adapts to emerging threats and changing contexts. The framework would be validated across multiple domains, starting with controlled healthcare applications, to demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying safety risks missed by pre-deployment testing. GAISMOF aims to establish safety monitoring as a continuous process rather than a one-time certification event.
