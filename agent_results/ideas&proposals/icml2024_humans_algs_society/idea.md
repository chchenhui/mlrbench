**Title:** Dynamic Causal Modeling of Algorithm-Human Feedback Loops for Equitable Societal Outcomes  

**Motivation:**  
Algorithmic decision-making systems often exacerbate societal harms (e.g., polarization, discrimination) through feedback loops where algorithmic outputs shape human behavior, which in turn retrain algorithms. Existing approaches focus on static datasets and short-term metrics, neglecting the dynamic interactions that drive long-term inequities. Addressing this requires modeling how feedback loops recursively influence both individual welfare and societal outcomes.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a dynamic causal framework to simulate and mitigate feedback loops between algorithmic systems (e.g., recommendation engines, credit scoring) and human behavior. Using structural causal models, we formalize interactions between algorithmic design (e.g., reward functions, data collection) and user responses (e.g., preference shifts, strategic adaptation). We integrate reinforcement learning with equilibrium analysis to identify conditions under which harmful feedback emerges (e.g., filter bubbles, gaming of algorithms) and empirically validate these dynamics using synthetic and real-world datasets. To ensure equity, we introduce "intervention modules" that regularize algorithms against amplifying disparities over time, balancing utility maximization with societal impact. Expected outcomes include (1) a toolkit for auditing feedback risks in deployed systems, (2) policy-aware training schemes that stabilize positive-sum interactions, and (3) benchmarks for long-term fairness in adaptive environments. This work bridges theory (causal modeling) and practice (system design), enabling algorithms to foster sustainable, equitable outcomes in evolving societal contexts.
