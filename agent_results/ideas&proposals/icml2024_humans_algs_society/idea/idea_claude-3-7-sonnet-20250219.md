# Strategic Behavior Modeling in Multi-Agent Recommender Systems

## Motivation
As algorithmic recommender systems become ubiquitous, we increasingly observe strategic adaptation by users seeking to manipulate these systems for personal gain. For example, content creators may deliberately optimize their content to match recommendation algorithms, while consumers may strategically interact with content to influence future recommendations. These strategic behaviors can lead to feedback loops that distort content quality, reduce diversity, and ultimately diminish platform value. Current recommender systems are not designed to account for or mitigate such strategic manipulation, creating an urgent need for models that can understand and address these complex multi-agent dynamics.

## Main Idea
I propose developing a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework specifically designed to model strategic behavior in recommender systems. The approach treats both content creators and consumers as strategic agents with evolving utility functions that respond to algorithmic decisions. By explicitly modeling how agents adapt their behavior based on their understanding of the recommendation algorithm, we can simulate the emergence of manipulation strategies and feedback loops. The framework will incorporate: (1) differentiable utility models that capture agent incentives and learning over time, (2) counterfactual reasoning tools that predict strategic responses to algorithmic changes, and (3) robust optimization methods that design recommendation policies resilient to manipulation. This research will enable platform designers to anticipate strategic adaptation, quantify its societal impact, and develop recommender systems that maintain quality and diversity even in the presence of strategic behavior.
