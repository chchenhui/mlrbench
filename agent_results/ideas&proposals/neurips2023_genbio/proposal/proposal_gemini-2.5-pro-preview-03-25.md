## 1. Title: Context-Aware Drug Design via Dual-Graph Variational Autoencoders Conditioned on Protein Interaction Networks

## 2. Introduction

**2.1 Background**
The intersection of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and biology is rapidly transforming biomedical research, particularly in the field of drug discovery and design (GenBio Workshop Scope). Generative models, including large language models adapted for biological sequences and graph-based methods for molecular structures, have demonstrated significant potential in generating novel biomolecules with desired properties (Ngo & Hy, 2023; Ünlü et al., 2023). These models can explore vast chemical spaces, predict molecular properties (Doe & Smith, 2023), and design candidates targeting specific proteins, promising to accelerate the traditionally slow and costly drug development pipeline.

However, a critical limitation of many current generative approaches is their tendency to optimize molecular properties, such as binding affinity to a specific target protein, in isolation. While achieving high target affinity *in vitro* is crucial, this narrow focus often neglects the intricate biological context in which drugs operate *in vivo*. Drugs function within complex cellular systems represented by protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and signaling pathways. Ignoring this network context can lead to molecules with unforeseen off-target interactions, pathway disruptions, or downstream toxicities, contributing to the high attrition rates observed in clinical trials (Green & Black, 2023). This gap highlights a pressing need, identified as an open challenge (GenBio Workshop Scope), to develop generative models that incorporate systems-level biological knowledge for more holistic and clinically relevant therapeutic design.

Integrating biological network information into the generative process offers a promising avenue to address this limitation (Karimi et al., 2020; Johnson & Williams, 2023). By considering the target protein within its relevant PPI subgraph, generative models could learn to design molecules that not only bind strongly to the intended target but also exhibit desirable network interaction profiles, such as minimizing interactions with proteins known to cause adverse effects or maximizing synergy within a specific pathway. Recent work has begun exploring network integration (Lee & Kim, 2023) and pathway constraints (Martinez & White, 2023), confirming the potential of this direction.

**2.2 Research Objectives**
This research aims to develop and validate a novel graph-based generative model for context-aware drug design, explicitly integrating molecular structure generation with PPI network topology. Our central hypothesis is that conditioning molecule generation on the local network context of the target protein will lead to candidates with improved target specificity and reduced potential for off-target effects compared to context-agnostic methods.

The specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Dual-Graph Context-Aware Variational Autoencoder (DGC-VGAE):** Design and implement a generative model based on the Variational Autoencoder framework that simultaneously processes molecular graphs and PPI subgraphs. This involves creating specialized graph neural network (GNN) encoders for each modality.
2.  **Implement Context Conditioning via Cross-Attention:** Integrate a cross-attention mechanism to allow the PPI network context representation to dynamically influence the generation of the molecular graph, ensuring that generated molecules are structurally appropriate for the given biological context.
3.  **Formulate a Context-Aware Objective Function:** Define a composite loss function for model training that simultaneously optimizes for accurate molecular graph reconstruction, desirable latent space properties (KL divergence), high predicted binding affinity to the target protein, and minimized predicted interactions with non-target proteins within the relevant PPI subgraph.
4.  **In Silico Validation and Benchmarking:** Rigorously evaluate the DGC-VGAE model's ability to generate valid, novel, and drug-like molecules. Compare its performance against state-of-the-art target-aware generative models that do not explicitly use PPI network context, focusing on metrics related to target affinity and predicted off-target profiles.
5.  **Analysis of Network-Conditioned Generation:** Investigate how varying the PPI network context for the same target protein influences the properties of the generated molecules, providing insights into the model's learned relationship between network topology and molecular structure.

**2.3 Significance**
This research directly addresses a critical bottleneck in computational drug discovery: the translation gap between *in vitro* predictions and *in vivo* efficacy/safety. By pioneering a principled approach to integrate systems-level biological context (PPI networks) into *de novo* molecular generation, this work promises several significant contributions:

*   **Methodological Advancement:** Introduces a novel dual-graph generative architecture (DGC-VGAE) with cross-attention conditioning specifically tailored for context-aware drug design, advancing the state-of-the-art in generative models for biology (GenBio Workshop Topics: Graph-based methods, Geometric deep learning potentially for future refinements).
*   **Improved Therapeutic Candidates:** Expected to generate drug candidates with a higher probability of success in later preclinical and clinical stages by optimizing for both target engagement and network compatibility early in the discovery process. This aligns with the GenBio goal of designing novel and useful biomolecules.
*   **Reduced Drug Development Costs and Timelines:** By improving the quality of computationally generated leads and reducing reliance on extensive experimental screening for off-target effects, the proposed approach can potentially streamline the drug discovery pipeline, making it more efficient and cost-effective.
*   **Addressing Key Challenges:** Directly tackles the challenges of integrating multimodal data (molecular graphs, PPI networks) and enhancing the relevance of *in silico* predictions for biological experiments (GenBio Workshop Topics: Open challenges, Identifying the right problems).
*   **Enhanced Understanding:** Provides a computational framework to systematically study the relationship between local network topology and the chemical structures best suited to modulate it, furthering our understanding of systems pharmacology.

Successfully achieving the objectives will provide a powerful new tool for rational drug design, contributing significantly to the fields of generative AI, computational biology, and pharmaceutical sciences.

## 3. Methodology

**3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing**

1.  **Small Molecule Data:** We will source known bioactive molecules and their target proteins primarily from databases like ChEMBL and DrugBank. Molecules will be standardized and represented as molecular graphs using libraries like RDKit, where nodes represent atoms (featurized by type, charge, chirality, etc.) and edges represent bonds (featurized by type, aromaticity, etc.). Non-drug-like molecules will be filtered based on criteria like Lipinski's Rule of Five and PAINS filters.
2.  **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Network Data:** A comprehensive human PPI network will be constructed by integrating data from established databases such as STRING, BioGRID, and IntAct. Interactions will be filtered based on confidence scores to retain high-quality interactions. The network will be represented as a graph $G_{PPI} = (V_{P}, E_{P})$, where $V_{P}$ is the set of proteins and $E_{P}$ is the set of interactions.
3.  **Target Protein Information:** For each bioactive molecule selected in step 1, its primary target protein(s) will be identified from the source databases.
4.  **PPI Subgraph Extraction:** For a given molecule-target pair $(M, P_{target})$, we will extract a relevant PPI subgraph $G_{ppi} \subset G_{PPI}$ representing the local biological context of $P_{target}$. The subgraph extraction strategy will initially involve selecting the $k$-hop neighbourhood around $P_{target}$ (e.g., $k=1$ or $2$). Alternatively, we will explore using pathway definitions from databases like KEGG or Reactome to define $G_{ppi}$ based on pathways involving $P_{target}$. The nodes (proteins) in $G_{ppi}$ can be featurized using pre-trained protein embeddings (e.g., from ESMFold or ProtT5) or simpler graph-based features (e.g., node degree).
5.  **Dataset Construction:** The final training dataset $\mathcal{D}$ will consist of triplets $(G_{mol}, P_{target}, G_{ppi})$, where $G_{mol}$ is the molecular graph of a known drug/bioactive molecule, $P_{target}$ is its primary target protein identifier, and $G_{ppi}$ is the corresponding extracted PPI subgraph context.

**3.2 Model Architecture: Dual-Graph Context-Aware Variational Autoencoder (DGC-VGAE)**

The proposed DGC-VGAE model adapts the Graph Variational Autoencoder framework (Kipf & Welling, 2016; Liu et al., 2018) to handle dual graph inputs and incorporate context conditioning.

1.  **Molecular Graph Encoder ($E_{mol}$):** This module encodes the input molecular graph $G_{mol}$ into a latent representation. We will employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN), such as a Graph Attention Network (GAT) or Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), known for their strong performance on molecular graphs (Doe & Smith, 2023).
    Let $H^{(0)}_{mol}$ be the initial node features of $G_{mol}$. The GNN layers compute node embeddings iteratively:
    $$ H^{(l+1)}_{mol} = \text{GNN}_{mol\_layer}^{(l)}(H^{(l)}_{mol}, A_{mol}) $$
    where $A_{mol}$ is the adjacency matrix of $G_{mol}$. After $L_{mol}$ layers, a graph pooling operation (e.g., sum or mean pooling) aggregates node embeddings into a graph-level representation $h_{mol} = \text{Pool}(H^{(L_{mol})}_{mol})$. This $h_{mol}$ is then mapped to the parameters of the latent distribution:
    $$ \mu_{mol}, \log \sigma^2_{mol} = \text{MLP}_{\mu}(h_{mol}), \text{MLP}_{\sigma}(h_{mol}) $$
    The molecular latent code $z_{mol}$ is sampled from $\mathcal{N}(\mu_{mol}, \text{diag}(\sigma^2_{mol}))$.

2.  **PPI Subgraph Encoder ($E_{ppi}$):** This module encodes the input PPI subgraph $G_{ppi}$ into a context vector $c_{ppi}$. Similarly, we will use a GNN (e.g., GCN or GAT) operating on $G_{ppi}$.
    Let $H^{(0)}_{ppi}$ be the initial protein node features (e.g., embeddings or graph features).
    $$ H^{(l+1)}_{ppi} = \text{GNN}_{ppi\_layer}^{(l)}(H^{(l)}_{ppi}, A_{ppi}) $$
    where $A_{ppi}$ is the adjacency matrix of $G_{ppi}$. After $L_{ppi}$ layers, graph pooling yields the context representation:
    $$ c_{ppi} = \text{Pool}(H^{(L_{ppi})}_{ppi}) $$

3.  **Cross-Attention Mechanism:** To enable context-aware generation, we introduce a cross-attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017; Davis & Brown, 2023) that allows the PPI context $c_{ppi}$ to modulate the molecular decoding process. Specifically, during the sequential decoding of the molecule, the hidden state of the decoder at each step will attend to the context vector $c_{ppi}$. Let $s_t$ be the decoder state at step $t$. An attended context $c'_{ppi, t}$ is computed:
    $$ \alpha_t = \text{softmax}(\frac{(W_q s_t)(W_k c_{ppi})^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}) $$
    $$ c'_{ppi, t} = \alpha_t (W_v c_{ppi}) $$
    where $W_q, W_k, W_v$ are learnable weight matrices and $d_k$ is the dimension of the keys. This attended context $c'_{ppi, t}$ will be integrated into the decoder's decision-making process at step $t$.

4.  **Molecular Graph Decoder ($D_{mol}$):** The decoder reconstructs the molecular graph $G_{mol}$ from the latent code $z_{mol}$, conditioned by the PPI context $c_{ppi}$ via the cross-attention mechanism. We will adapt a sequential generation process similar to Liu et al. (2018). The decoder iteratively decides whether to add a node, what type of atom to add, whether to add an edge between the new node and existing nodes, and what type of bond, finally deciding when to stop generation. At each step $t$, the decision is based on the current decoder state $s_t$, the latent code $z_{mol}$, and the attended context $c'_{ppi, t}$. For example, the probability of adding atom type $a$ might be modeled as:
    $$ p(\text{atom}_t = a | s_t, z_{mol}, c'_{ppi, t}) = \text{softmax}(\text{MLP}_{atom}(s_t, z_{mol}, c'_{ppi, t})) $$
    Similar probabilistic decisions are made for adding edges and stopping generation.

**3.3 Objective Function**

The DGC-VGAE model will be trained end-to-end by minimizing a composite loss function $L$:
$$ L = L_{recon} + \beta L_{KL} + \gamma L_{bind} + \delta L_{interf} $$

*   **Reconstruction Loss ($L_{recon}$):** The negative log-likelihood of reconstructing the input molecular graph $G_{mol}$ given $z_{mol}$ and $c_{ppi}$. This ensures the VAE learns meaningful latent representations.
    $$ L_{recon} = - \mathbb{E}_{q(z_{mol}|G_{mol}, G_{ppi})} [\log p(G_{mol} | z_{mol}, c_{ppi})] $$
*   **KL Divergence ($L_{KL}$):** The Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned latent distribution $q(z_{mol}|G_{mol}, G_{ppi})$ and a prior distribution $p(z_{mol})$ (typically $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$). This acts as a regularization term.
    $$ L_{KL} = D_{KL}(q(z_{mol}|G_{mol}, G_{ppi}) || p(z_{mol})) $$
*   **Binding Affinity Loss ($L_{bind}$):** Encourages the generation of molecules with high predicted binding affinity to the target protein $P_{target}$. We will use a pre-trained or concurrently trained predictor $f_{bind}(G_{gen}, P_{target})$ that estimates binding affinity (e.g., pIC50 or docking scorSe). The loss aims to maximize affinity (minimize negative affinity).
    $$ L_{bind} = - \mathbb{E}_{G_{gen} \sim p(G|z_{mol}, c_{ppi})} [f_{bind}(G_{gen}, P_{target})] $$
    Alternatively, during training on known pairs, we can use the known activity value as a target for a regression loss. For generation, maximizing the predicted score is relevant.
*   **Network Interference Loss ($L_{interf}$):** Penalizes generated molecules $G_{gen}$ predicted to interact strongly with non-target proteins $\{P_i\}$ within the context subgraph $G_{ppi}$. We need a predictor $f_{interact}(G_{gen}, P_i)$ for off-target interactions (this could be the same architecture as $f_{bind}$ or a simpler binary classifier).
    $$ L_{interf} = \mathbb{E}_{G_{gen} \sim p(G|z_{mol}, c_{ppi})} \left[ \sum_{P_i \in V(G_{ppi}), P_i \neq P_{target}} f_{interact}(G_{gen}, P_i) \right] $$
*   **Hyperparameters:** $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\delta$ are scalar weights that balance the contribution of each term. Their values will be determined empirically via cross-validation.

**3.4 Training**
The model will be trained using stochastic gradient descent with the Adam optimizer. We will use standard practices like mini-batch training, gradient clipping, and learning rate scheduling. Training will be performed on high-performance computing clusters equipped with GPUs. We will split the dataset $\mathcal{D}$ into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets. Hyperparameter tuning (GNN architectures, embedding dimensions, latent space dimension, loss weights $\beta, \gamma, \delta$) will be guided by performance on the validation set, particularly focusing on a combination of reconstruction accuracy and desirable generated molecule properties.

**3.5 Experimental Design and Validation**

1.  **Baseline Models:** We will compare DGC-VGAE against:
    *   A standard Molecular VAE/GAN (e.g., based on Liu et al., 2018) without target or context information.
    *   A Target-aware VAE (similar to Ngo & Hy, 2023) that uses target information but not PPI context.
    *   A simple context integration baseline (e.g., concatenating $z_{mol}$ and $c_{ppi}$ before decoding, without cross-attention).
    *   Perhaps a model similar to Lee & Kim (2023) if implementation details are available, for direct comparison.

2.  **Evaluation Metrics:** Generated molecules will be evaluated on:
    *   **Generation Quality:**
        *   *Validity:* Percentage of chemically valid molecules generated (checked using RDKit).
        *   *Uniqueness:* Percentage of unique molecules among the valid generated ones.
        *   *Novelty:* Percentage of valid, unique molecules not present in the training set (measured by Tanimoto similarity to nearest neighbors in the training data).
        *   *Drug-likeness:* Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED) scores and Synthetic Accessibility (SA) scores.
    *   **Target Performance:**
        *   *Predicted Binding Affinity:* Distribution of predicted binding scores ($f_{bind}$ or docking scores using AutoDock Vina/Glide) for generated molecules against their intended target $P_{target}$.
        *   *Enrichment:* Ability to generate molecules predicted to be highly active for the target.
    *   **Context-Awareness / Selectivity:**
        *   *Predicted Off-Target Interactions:* Distribution of predicted interaction scores ($f_{interact}$ or docking scores) against known off-target proteins present in the input $G_{ppi}$. We expect DGC-VGAE to show lower predicted off-target interactions compared to baselines.
        *   *Pathway Analysis:* Perform pathway enrichment analysis (e.g., using DAVID, Metascape) on the set of predicted high-confidence off-targets for molecules generated by DGC-VGAE vs. baselines. DGC-VGAE should ideally show off-targets enriched in fewer unrelated pathways.
        *   *Selectivity Score:* A metric comparing predicted affinity for the target vs. predicted affinities for off-targets.

3.  **Ablation Studies:** To assess the contribution of key components, we will conduct ablation studies by systematically removing:
    *   The PPI context encoder ($E_{ppi}$) and cross-attention (reducing to a target-aware VAE).
    *   The cross-attention mechanism (using simple concatenation of $z_{mol}$ and $c_{ppi}$).
    *   The context-related loss terms ($L_{interf}$) from the objective function.

4.  **Case Studies:** We will select specific targets (e.g., kinases involved in cancer pathways) and their associated PPI contexts to perform deeper analysis of the generated molecules, comparing their structures and predicted properties relative to known inhibitors and baseline model outputs.

**3.6 Addressing Challenges**
*   **Data Integration:** The dual-graph architecture explicitly handles heterogeneous data. Feature engineering for nodes (atoms, proteins) will be crucial.
*   **Scalability:** We will use efficient GNN implementations and distributed training if necessary. Subgraph sampling strategies will manage the size of PPI context.
*   **Interpretability:** While complex, attention weights from the cross-attention mechanism might offer some insight into which parts of the PPI context influence specific structural features. Post-hoc analysis of generated molecules linking structure to context will be performed.
*   **Data Quality:** We rely on curated databases but acknowledge noise is inherent. Filtering and potentially using interaction confidence scores as edge weights in $G_{ppi}$ can mitigate this.
*   **Validation:** *In silico* validation is the primary scope. We acknowledge the need for future experimental validation but will use established computational methods (docking, property prediction) and compare against known drugs.

It will bridge the gap between molecular-level optimization and systems-level considerations in drug design, fostering a new generation of context-aware generative models potentially applicable to other biomolecules (peptides, antibodies) where network interactions are crucial. It directly contributes to the GenBio workshop themes of designing novel biomolecules, graph-based generative methods, and addressing open challenges in bridging AI with biological needs.
*   **Translational and Economic Impact:** By generating lead compounds that are intrinsically designed to be more selective and less prone to causing unwanted side effects due to network perturbations, this research has the potential to increase the success rate of drug candidates entering clinical trials. This could lead to a substantial reduction in the time and cost associated with drug development (estimated at over $1 billion per drug). The ability to rapidly generate context-optimized candidates could accelerate the delivery of safer and more effective treatments for various diseases.
*   **Broader Impact:** This work underscores the power of integrating domain knowledge (systems biology) with advanced AI techniques. The principles developed here could inspire similar context-aware generative approaches in other scientific domains where network structures play a critical role (e.g., materials science, social network analysis). It will also contribute trained personnel skilled in interdisciplinary research at the interface of AI, chemistry, and biology.

In conclusion, the proposed research offers a novel and principled approach to tackle a fundamental challenge in drug discovery. By leveraging the power of dual-graph neural networks and context conditioning, we aim to develop a next-generation generative model that designs not just potent molecules, but contextually appropriate therapeutics with a higher likelihood of *in vivo* success.
