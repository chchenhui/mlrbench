# BioCONTEXT: Graph-Based Generative Modeling for Context-Aware Therapeutic Design Using Protein Interaction Networks

## Introduction

Drug discovery remains a challenging, time-consuming, and expensive process, with only a small fraction of candidate molecules successfully reaching clinical approval. A key factor contributing to this high attrition rate is the disconnect between promising in vitro performance and disappointing in vivo outcomes. Many drug candidates that show excellent binding affinity to their intended targets often fail in clinical trials due to unforeseen off-target effects or unintended disruptions in biological pathways leading to toxicity, limited efficacy, or adverse side effects (Karimi et al., 2020).

Traditional computational approaches to drug design have primarily focused on optimizing molecular properties such as binding affinity, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profiles, and physicochemical characteristics. While these properties are crucial, they often neglect the broader biological context in which these molecules operate. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly graph-based generative models, have shown promising results in de novo molecular design (Liu et al., 2018). However, even these sophisticated approaches typically focus on the molecule in isolation rather than considering its effects within complex biological systems.

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks represent the intricate web of molecular interactions that underpin cellular function. These networks capture the context in which drug targets exist and operate, providing crucial information about pathway connections, potential off-target effects, and system-wide consequences of target modulation. Integrating PPI networks into the drug design process could significantly enhance the contextual understanding of drug action, potentially leading to candidates with improved efficacy and reduced side effects (Green & Black, 2023).

The emergence of generative AI models that can process and learn from graph-structured data presents a unique opportunity to bridge this gap. By simultaneously modeling both molecular structures and biological networks, we can develop a more holistic approach to drug discovery that considers not just the target protein but its entire biological context.

**Research Objectives:**

1. Develop a dual-graph generative model that integrates molecular graphs and protein-protein interaction networks to enable context-aware therapeutic design.
   
2. Create a cross-attention mechanism that aligns molecular and biological network embeddings to condition molecule generation on pathway-specific constraints.
   
3. Validate the approach through comprehensive in silico evaluation including docking studies, pathway enrichment analysis, and comparison with existing drug design methods.
   
4. Demonstrate the model's ability to generate novel therapeutic candidates that balance target specificity with minimal off-pathway interference.

**Significance:**

This research addresses a critical gap in current generative AI approaches to drug discovery by explicitly incorporating biological context into the design process. By considering the wider implications of drug-target interactions within PPI networks, the proposed model could significantly improve the success rate of drug candidates in clinical trials, reduce development costs, and accelerate the discovery of novel therapeutics for challenging targets. Furthermore, the dual-graph architecture represents a methodological advancement that could be extended to other domains where context-aware generation is beneficial, such as materials science or chemical engineering.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

**1. Dataset Construction:**

We will construct a comprehensive dataset consisting of:

- **Drug-target pairs**: Curated from ChEMBL, BindingDB, and PubChem, including small molecules with experimentally validated binding data against specific protein targets (approximately 500,000 pairs).
  
- **Protein-protein interaction networks**: Sourced from STRING, BioGRID, and IntAct databases, focusing on high-confidence interactions (confidence score > 0.7).
  
- **Pathway information**: Obtained from KEGG and Reactome databases to provide functional context to the PPI networks.

**2. Data Processing:**

- **Molecular representations**: Each small molecule will be converted into a graph representation where nodes represent atoms and edges represent bonds. Node features will include atom type, charge, and hybridization, while edge features will include bond type and stereochemistry.
  
- **PPI subnetwork extraction**: For each target protein, we will extract a subnetwork from the global PPI network, including first and second-order neighbors. These subnetworks will represent the biological context of the target.
  
- **Data augmentation**: We will employ techniques such as random masking of nodes/edges and subgraph sampling to increase data diversity and improve model generalization.

### Model Architecture

We propose a dual-graph variational autoencoder (DG-VAE) architecture with cross-attention mechanisms to integrate molecular and biological context information. The model consists of several key components:

**1. Molecular Graph Encoder ($E_{mol}$):**

We will use a Graph Transformer architecture to encode molecular graphs into a latent representation. For a molecular graph $G_{mol} = (V_{mol}, E_{mol})$:

$$h_v^{(0)} = \text{Embed}(v), \quad v \in V_{mol}$$

For $l = 1, 2, ..., L$ layers:

$$h_v^{(l)} = \text{GraphTransformerLayer}(h_v^{(l-1)}, \{h_u^{(l-1)} | u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\}, \{e_{uv} | u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\})$$

Where $\mathcal{N}(v)$ represents the neighbors of node $v$, and $e_{uv}$ is the feature vector of the edge connecting nodes $u$ and $v$.

The final molecular representation is given by:

$$z_{mol} = \text{Pool}(\{h_v^{(L)} | v \in V_{mol}\})$$

This embedding is then projected to form the parameters of a Gaussian distribution:

$$\mu_{mol}, \log \sigma_{mol} = \text{MLP}(z_{mol})$$

**2. PPI Network Encoder ($E_{ppi}$):**

Similarly, for a PPI subnetwork $G_{ppi} = (V_{ppi}, E_{ppi})$:

$$h_p^{(0)} = \text{Embed}(p), \quad p \in V_{ppi}$$

For $l = 1, 2, ..., L$ layers:

$$h_p^{(l)} = \text{GATLayer}(h_p^{(l-1)}, \{h_q^{(l-1)} | q \in \mathcal{N}(p)\})$$

Where GAT refers to Graph Attention Network layers, which allow for differentially weighting the importance of neighboring proteins based on their features.

The final PPI representation is:

$$z_{ppi} = \text{Pool}(\{h_p^{(L)} | p \in V_{ppi}\})$$

This is also projected to form a Gaussian distribution:

$$\mu_{ppi}, \log \sigma_{ppi} = \text{MLP}(z_{ppi})$$

**3. Cross-Attention Module:**

To align the molecular and PPI latent spaces, we employ a cross-attention mechanism:

$$A = \text{softmax}(\frac{Q_{mol}K_{ppi}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})$$

$$z_{context} = A \cdot V_{ppi}$$

Where $Q_{mol}$ is derived from $z_{mol}$, while $K_{ppi}$ and $V_{ppi}$ are derived from $z_{ppi}$. $d_k$ is the dimension of the keys.

**4. Context-Conditioned Latent Representation:**

We combine the molecular and context information to form the final latent representation:

$$z_{combined} = \text{Concatenate}(z_{mol}, z_{context})$$

This is then refined through a gating mechanism:

$$z_{final} = g \odot z_{mol} + (1-g) \odot z_{context}$$

Where $g = \sigma(W[z_{mol}, z_{context}] + b)$ and $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.

**5. Molecular Graph Decoder:**

The decoder reconstructs molecular graphs from the latent representation using an autoregressive approach:

$$p(G_{mol}|z_{final}) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} p(a_t|a_{<t}, z_{final})$$

Where $a_t$ represents the action at step $t$ (adding a node, adding an edge, or terminating).

For each step, we compute:

$$h_{dec}^{(t)} = \text{GRU}(h_{dec}^{(t-1)}, [a_{t-1}, z_{final}])$$

$$p(a_t|a_{<t}, z_{final}) = \text{MLP}(h_{dec}^{(t)})$$

**6. Loss Function:**

The overall loss function combines several terms:

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{recon} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{KL} + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{prop} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{path}$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{recon}$ is the reconstruction loss for the molecular graph
- $\mathcal{L}_{KL}$ is the KL divergence between the latent distribution and a standard normal
- $\mathcal{L}_{prop}$ is a property prediction loss to ensure the generated molecules have desired properties
- $\mathcal{L}_{path}$ is a pathway interference loss that penalizes predicted disruptions to off-target pathways

### Training Procedure

**1. Pretraining Phase:**

- Each encoder ($E_{mol}$ and $E_{ppi}$) will be pretrained separately to learn meaningful representations of molecular graphs and PPI networks.
- The molecular encoder will be pretrained on a reconstruction task using the entire dataset of drug-like molecules.
- The PPI encoder will be pretrained on a link prediction task to capture the structure of protein interaction networks.

**2. Joint Training Phase:**

- After pretraining, the entire model will be jointly trained end-to-end using the paired data of drugs and their corresponding PPI subnetworks.
- We will employ a curriculum learning strategy, gradually increasing the complexity of the generation task.
- Training will use a batch size of 64 and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4 and a cosine annealing schedule.

**3. Fine-tuning Phase:**

- The model will be fine-tuned for specific therapeutic areas or target classes using smaller, focused datasets.
- During this phase, we will increase the weight of the pathway interference loss to emphasize context awareness.

### Molecule Generation and Evaluation
