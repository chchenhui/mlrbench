# **Graph-Based Generative Modeling for Context-Aware Therapeutic Design Using Protein Interaction Networks**

## **Introduction**

The application of generative artificial intelligence in drug discovery has transformed molecular design, enabling efficient screening and optimization of novel therapeutics. Traditional approaches often rely on isolated molecular property optimization, such as binding affinity or pharmacokinetic profiles, neglecting the broader biological context in which drug actions occur. This simplification leads to high attrition rates during clinical trials due to unforeseen pathway-level effects or off-target interactions. Recent advances in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and systems biology offer a compelling opportunity to address this gap by embedding drug candidates into a biological framework that maps how proteins dynamically regulate cellular states. By leveraging this network-level knowledge, generative AI can prioritize molecules that modulate specific therapeutic pathways while minimizing unintended network perturbations, which is critical for improving in vivo efficacy and safety.

Current generative models like TargetVAE and DrugGEN demonstrate the power of integrating protein representations or target-specific constraints into molecular design (Ngo et al., 2023; Ünlü et al., 2023). However, these approaches focus on localized interactions and do not fully exploit the interconnected nature of cellular systems. Pathway-constrained methods (Martinez et al., 2023) and dual-graph frameworks (Lee & Kim, 2023) have begun incorporating network principles, but limitations in multimodal alignment and pathway-specific regularization persist. This proposal introduces a dual-graph generative model combining molecular and PPI network representations to enable context-aware design, directly addressing these challenges.

The research problem centers on the disconnect between molecular design and systemic biological function. Despite improvements in binding affinity prediction alone, existing models fail to guarantee therapeutic candidates operate within biological networks without harmful secondary effects. This is a pressing need in drug discovery, where ~90% of small molecules fail in clinical trials due to off-target toxicity or poor efficacy (Waring et al., 2020). The proposed solution introduces cross-attention mechanisms to align heterogeneous graph modalities and integrates PPI-derived pathway constraints into the generative loss function (Davis & Brown, 2023). This methodology extends work on generative adversarial networks (GANs) in drug design (Ünlü et al., 2023) and builds upon constrained variational autoencoders (Liu et al., 2018), enhancing biological relevance without sacrificing molecular feasibility.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to redefine therapeutic design as a network-aware optimization problem. By encoding both molecular graphs and PPI networks simultaneously, the model could reduce reliance on iterative experimental trial-and-error validation (Green & Black, 2023), accelerating development timelines and lowering discovery costs. Specifically, this work targets applications in complex diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration, where pathway cross-talk significantly impacts treatment outcomes (Hasanzadeh et al., 2020). The resulting framework will bridge a critical gap in current computational pipelines—aligning generative molecular design with systems-level pharmacology principles.

## **Methodology**

This section outlines the detailed methodology for developing a dual-graph generative model that integrates molecular graphs and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. The approach leverages graph variational autoencoders (VGAEs) with cross-attention mechanisms, following advances in multimodal representation learning (Ünlü et al., 2023; Davis & Brown, 2023) and constrained molecular generation (Liu et al., 2018). The framework enables simultaneous encoding of molecular and biological network properties, conditioning molecule synthesis on therapeutic pathway constraints.

### **Data Collection and Preprocessing**

The model training utilizes curated datasets of known small molecule-protein interactions with associated network context. ChEMBL (version 30) and BindingDB provide standardized molecular-target binding affinities, while the STRING database maps PPI networks. For each drug-target pair, the corresponding PPI subnetwork is extracted using k-neighbor expansion around the primary target, forming a biologically relevant context. This includes both direct protein binding partners and second-degree interactions within core regulatory pathways. 

Preprocessing converts molecules into graph representations $G_m = (V_m, E_m)$, where nodes $v_i \in V_m$ represent atoms and edges $e_{ij} \in E_m$ encode bond types. Node features $x_i$ include atomic number, hybridization state, and aromaticity, while edge features $e_{ij}$ capture bond lengths and angles. PPI networks are modeled as graphs $G_p = (V_p, E_p)$, with nodes representing proteins and edges reflecting interaction confidence scores (Košinov et al., 2023). Protein features $x_p \in \mathbb{R}^d$ encode evolutionary conservation, interaction hubness, and functional annotations. The dataset is partitioned using a stratified split to ensure balanced target pathway distribution during cross-validation.

### **Model Architecture**

The architecture combines two VGAEs—one for molecules and one for PPI networks—with cross-attention integration. Both encoders use graph convolutional networks (GCNs), while the molecular decoder implements a sequential graph extension (SGE) to maintain synthesizability (Liu et al., 2018).  

**Molecular Encoder** extracts latent representations $z_m \in \mathbb{R}^{d_m}$ by processing graph-structured molecules:
$$
z_m = \text{GCN}_m(G_m)
$$
**PPI Encoder** embeds subnetworks $G_p$ via:
$$
z_p = \text{GCN}_p(G_p)
$$
**Cross-Attention Mechanism** aligns latent spaces by attending molecular features $Q_m$ to PPI keys $K_p$ and vice versa:
$$
\text{Attention}(Q_m, K_p, V_p) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_mK_p^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V_p
$$
$$
\text{Attention}(Q_p, K_m, V_m) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_pK_m^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V_m
$$
The final embedding $z_{\text{merged}}$ fuses $z_m, z_p, Q_mK_p, Q_pK_m$ via dense layers for multi-head attention.  

**Decoding** reconstructs molecular graphs using a GCN-based generative module conditioned on $z_{\text{merged}}$. The objective function $L_{\text{total}}$ combines VGAE reconstruction loss $L_{\text{rec}}$, pathway-aware regularization $L_{\text{pathway}}$, and KL divergence $L_{\text{KL}}$:
$$
L_{\text{total}} = L_{\text{rec}} + \beta_1 L_{\text{KL}} + \beta_2 L_{\text{pathway}}
$$
where $L_{\text{pathway}}$ penalizes activation of unintended pathways quantified through functional enrichment analysis (Green & Black, 2023).

### **Training and Validation**

The model is trained in two phases: (1) pretraining molecular and PPI encoders using contrastive loss for representation learning, followed by (2) joint training via stochastic gradient descent with AdamW optimizer. Hyperparameters are tuned using Bayesian optimization over validation sets. 

Quantitative evaluation includes:

1. **Molecular Validity**: \% valid graphs generated using RDKit’s molecular validity checks.
2. **Novelty**: Tanimoto similarity against training molecules (<0.5 considered novel) (Ünlü et al., 2023).
3. **Binding Affinity**: Docking scores with target proteins using AutoDock Vina (Trott & Olson, 2010).
4. **Pathway Specificity**: Enrichment analysis with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005).

These metrics assess both chemical realism and biological context awareness, ensuring the generative model synthesizes molecules that align with intended pathways while avoiding disruptive off-pathway interactions. This structured workflow directly addresses challenges in data heterogeneity and biological relevance raised in prior literature (Lee & Kim, 2023; Martinez et al., 2023), establishing a foundation for precise, network-informed de novo drug discovery.

## **Experimental Design and Comparative Validation**

To rigorously evaluate the proposed dual-graph variational autoencoder (VGAE) framework, we design a multi-stage experimental protocol that compares its performance against established generative models while assessing its unique pathway-aware capabilities. The validation pipeline includes in silico docking, pathway enrichment analysis, and molecular property prediction benchmarks.

### **Evaluation Metrics**

We define three distinct metric categories:  
1. **Chemical Feasibility**: Measures molecular validity, novelty (as Tanimoto similarity to training data), and synthesizability via Synthetic Accessibility Scores (SA-score). Valid molecules adhering to Lipinski’s Rule of Five are prioritized.  
2. **Binding Precision**: Quantifies target-specific interactions using AutoDock Vina docking scores (Trott & Olson, 2010), root mean square deviation (RMSD) between predicted and known ligand conformations, and ligand-target interaction fingerprints (LIFt).  
3. **System-Level Selectivity**: Implements multi-scale analysis via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) quantifying unintended pathway activations, and perturbation analysis measuring network-level effects using differential expression modeling (Subramanian et al., 2005).

### **Baseline Models**

Comparative testing involves four established frameworks spanning molecular- and network-level strategies:  
1. **TargetVAE** (Ngo et al., 2023): Single-graph molecular VAE conditioned on protein pocket embeddings.  
2. **DrugGEN** (Ünlü et al., 2023): GraphTransformer-based GAN for target-specific de novo design.  
3. **MolGNet** (Green & Black, 2023): Multimodal VAE combining SMILES and pharmacophore representations.  
4. **PathDNN** (Martinez et al., 2023): Pathway constraint model using feed-forward neural networks rather than graph structures.

### **Statistical Methods**

All quantitative comparisons use paired t-tests ($p < 0.05, 95\% CI$), with hierarchical false discovery rate (FDR) correction for pathway enrichment analysis. Docking comparisons utilize the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for score distributions across targets. For synthetic data evaluation against experimental baselines (e.g., AKT1-focused DrugGEN), we replicate target-specific validation with 10-fold cross-target validation. Model stability across training sessions is quantified through reproducibility experiments, analyzing variance in novelty and pathway scores over five random seeds. These methods align with recent reproducibility standards in computational drug discovery (Hasanzadeh et al., 2020; Lee & Kim, 2023), ensuring robustness in assessing improvements over prior work.

## **Expected Outcomes**  

This research aims to produce a dual-graph generative model capable of designing small molecules that simultaneously achieve strong target binding while being optimized for minimal unintended pathway interference. Central outcomes include:  

1. **Molecular Graph Generation**: The model will synthesize bioactive ligands with validated docking scores (AutoDock Vina $<$ -8.0 kcal/mol) against target proteins, with $>$80\% of candidates satisfying Lipinski’s Rule of Five for drug-likeness. Novelty will exceed 50\% as measured by Tanimoto similarity against existing compound databases (ChEMBL, PubChem).  
2. **Pathway-aware Optimization**: Through integrated cross-attention and pathway enrichment losses, the framework will prioritize molecules inducing significant activation (GSEA FDR $<$ 0.05) only in treatment-relevant pathways, while avoiding unintended network perturbations. This will address a key limitation in prior AI-guided design strategies, which often lack network-level specificity (Martinez et al., 2023; Green & Black, 2023).  
3. **Generative Precision Trade-off**: We expect a balanced model where pathway constraints enhance functional selectivity without compromising molecular realism, with $<$15\% deviation in SA-scores compared to unconstrained baselines (Liu et al., 2018; Ünlü et al., 2023).  

These contributions will provide a scalable, interpretable framework for therapeutic design, where deep generative models encode both molecular and biological constraints—a critical gap identified in prior literature (Hasanzadeh et al., 2020; Lee & Kim, 2023). The ability to simultaneously optimize for target binding and systemic interactions will overcome the inefficiencies of current pipelines that often require post-hoc toxicity screening (Waring et al., 2020). By demonstrating these capabilities, the model will offer a principled approach to systematically prioritize molecules with dual chemical and biological viability.

## **Anticipated Impact on Drug Discovery**  

The proposed dual-graph generative model stands to significantly improve the efficiency and efficacy of the drug discovery pipeline by integrating molecular and biological constraints into a unified representation. Current discovery platforms often rely on separate optimization stages—first for molecular binding, then for pathway-level toxicity—which increases development time and cost (Waring et al., 2020). Our framework shifts this paradigm by enabling simultaneous molecular and network-level optimization, potentially reducing preclinical attrition rates by preemptively selecting therapeutics that align with biological context. With the average cost of developing a novel therapeutic exceeding $2.6 billion (DiMasi et al., 2016), this innovation could substantially mitigate financial risks in drug discovery.

Clinically, pathway-aware generation holds promise for advancing precision medicine by designing compounds tailored to disease-specific interaction networks. Oncology applications, where drug resistance emerges through compensatory pathway activation, could particularly benefit (Ünlü et al., 2023). Similarly, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, driven by multifactorial protein interactions, may see progress through therapeutics that modulate interconnected pathways while avoiding deleterious effects (Hasanzadeh et al., 2020). The model’s capacity to align molecular generation with biological networks also supports broader applications beyond small molecules, including targeted degrader design and gene therapy platforms—key frontiers in the GenBio Workshop’s scope. By directly addressing current limitations in multimodal integration (Lee & Kim, 2023) and off-target prediction (Martinez et al., 2023), the research will provide a scalable, interpretable foundation for next-generation therapeutics, accelerating translation from computational models to validated clinical candidates.
