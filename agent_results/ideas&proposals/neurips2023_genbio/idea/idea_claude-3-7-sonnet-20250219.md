# FoldForge: A Geometric-Semantic Protein Design Framework

## Motivation
Current protein design approaches often struggle to balance structural precision with functional requirements. While geometric deep learning methods excel at modeling 3D structures and language models capture evolutionary patterns in sequences, they typically operate independently. This disconnect limits our ability to design proteins with both stable folds and specific biochemical functions. A unified framework that simultaneously optimizes for geometric constraints and semantic properties would significantly advance our capability to create novel proteins with targeted therapeutic functions.

## Main Idea
FoldForge integrates geometric deep learning with language model embeddings in a joint optimization framework for protein design. The core architecture consists of two parallel pipelines: (1) a geometric encoder-decoder that models protein structure as a 3D point cloud with physical constraints, and (2) a protein language model that captures functional domains and biochemical properties. These components are connected through a novel cross-attention mechanism that aligns structural features with sequence embeddings. During generation, the framework enables explicit conditioning on both target structural motifs (binding pockets, active sites) and functional specifications (enzyme activity, binding affinity). This allows for targeted exploration of the protein design space with biologically relevant constraints. The system will be validated on therapeutic protein design tasks, potentially accelerating the development of novel biologics for conditions currently lacking effective treatments.
