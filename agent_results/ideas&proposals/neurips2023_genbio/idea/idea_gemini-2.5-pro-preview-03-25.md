**Title:** Active Bayesian Experimental Design for Biomolecule Optimization using Generative Surrogates

**Motivation:** Designing novel biomolecules with generative AI is promising, but validating designs requires costly, time-consuming wet-lab experiments. Current approaches often rely on large virtual screens followed by bulk testing, which is inefficient. An adaptive experimental strategy driven by AI could significantly accelerate the discovery of functional biomolecules by intelligently prioritizing experiments.

**Main Idea:** We propose an active learning framework integrating generative models with Bayesian Optimization for efficient experimental design. A generative model (e.g., VAE or Flow-based) will serve as a differentiable surrogate mapping biomolecule design space (sequences/structures) to predicted function. In each cycle, Bayesian Optimization, guided by the surrogate's predictions and uncertainty estimates, identifies a small batch of candidate designs expected to yield maximal information gain or functional improvement. These candidates are experimentally synthesized and tested. The wet-lab results are used to refine the generative surrogate model's posterior distribution, improving its accuracy for the next design cycle. This "GenerativeAI-in-the-loop" approach aims to significantly reduce the number of required experiments and accelerate convergence to optimized biomolecules compared to standard screening methods.
