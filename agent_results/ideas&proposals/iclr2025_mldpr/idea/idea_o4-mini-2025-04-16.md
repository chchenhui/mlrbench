Title: AutoDoc: Automated Data Documentation for Foundation Model Datasets

Motivation:  
Manual documentation of massive, unstructured corpora used to train foundation models is prohibitively time-consuming, leading to hidden biases, ethical oversights, and poor dataset reuse. Automating this process is essential to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and responsible data practices at scale.

Main Idea:  
Develop an end-to-end pipeline that (1) ingests raw dataset files, (2) automatically extracts metadata (language distributions, token statistics), (3) runs bias/fairness detectors and PII/privacy scanners, (4) checks licensing compliance, and (5) uses a large language model, guided by a “Datasheets for Datasets” template, to generate both human-readable documentation and machine-readable JSON. A web UI enables collaborative human review, feedback, and iterative refinement of outputs. We will benchmark this system on large public corpora (e.g., C4, LAION) to evaluate documentation completeness, accuracy, and reductions in manual effort. Expected outcomes include an 80%+ cut in documentation time, improved dataset transparency, and streamlined deprecation decisions—advancing FAIR, ethical ML data practices.
