**Title:** Context-Aware Dynamic Benchmarking Mechanisms in ML Repositories  

**Motivation:**  
Traditional benchmarking in ML often relies on static datasets and narrow metrics, leading to overfitting, dataset misuse, and poor real-world generalization. This approach neglects critical contextual factors—such as ethical considerations, domain-specific requirements, and evolving data distributions—that influence model performance. Addressing these challenges requires a paradigm shift toward adaptive, holistic evaluation frameworks that align with the lifecycle and documentation of datasets.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a dynamic benchmarking framework embedded within ML repositories (e.g., HuggingFace, OpenML), where datasets are linked to granular contextual metadata (e.g., provenance, bias profiles, deployment conditions). When a model is evaluated, the system automatically generates adaptive test protocols tailored to the dataset’s context, incorporating:  
1. **Synthetic perturbations** (e.g., noise, distribution shifts) to assess robustness.  
2. **Context-specific metrics** (e.g., fairness, environmental impact, uncertainty calibration).  
3. **Cross-dataset validation** to flag out-of-context use.  
        
Repositories would host versioned benchmarks that evolve with new research insights, deprecating outdated tests while integrating community feedback. Models would receive multi-dimensional “benchmark scores,” visualizing trade-offs between metrics. This approach encourages responsible innovation by penalizing overfitting, rewarding contextual adaptability, and tying model evaluation directly to FAIR documentation standards. Expected impacts include improved model reliability, reduced dataset overuse, and fostering repository-driven culture shifts toward lifecycle-aware ML practices.
