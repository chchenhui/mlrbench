**1. Title:**

Explainable Mathematical Reasoning via Dynamically Integrated Knowledge Graphs in Large Language Models

**2. Introduction**

*   **Background:** Mathematical reasoning, the cornerstone of scientific discovery, engineering innovation, and logical thought, involves structured manipulation of concepts, axioms, and procedures to derive conclusions. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a significant milestone in artificial intelligence, showcasing remarkable abilities in natural language processing and, increasingly, in quantitative reasoning tasks (OpenAI, 2023; Google DeepMind, 2023). LLMs can solve mathematical word problems, generate code for computations, and even assist in formulating conjectures (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022). However, their application in high-stakes domains like scientific research, financial modeling, and education is hampered by their inherent opacity. LLMs often operate as "black boxes," providing answers without transparent, verifiable reasoning steps. This lack of interpretability makes it difficult to trust their outputs, debug errors, or understand the underlying logic, particularly for complex, multi-step problems where maintaining logical coherence is paramount (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Furthermore, LLMs are susceptible to "hallucinations," generating plausible but factually incorrect statements or calculation errors, which can be especially detrimental in mathematics (Ji et al., 2023).

*   **Research Gap and Motivation:** While LLMs demonstrate potential, there is a critical need for AI systems that not only achieve high accuracy in mathematical reasoning but also provide transparent, step-by-step explanations for their conclusions. Existing approaches often rely on techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022), which elicits intermediate reasoning steps as natural language text. While helpful, CoT does not guarantee logical soundness or provide a structured, verifiable trace of the reasoning process. Recent works have explored integrating LLMs with external knowledge sources, including knowledge graphs (KGs), primarily for factual question answering or static knowledge retrieval (Luo et al., 2023a; Kim et al., 2023). However, applying this synergy specifically to the *dynamic* process of mathematical problem-solving, where the reasoning structure itself evolves step-by-step, remains an underexplored area. The challenge lies in creating a system where the LLM's reasoning process is explicitly grounded in and structured by a formal representation that captures mathematical entities, relationships, and logical dependencies as they are employed.

*   **Proposed Solution:** We propose a novel framework, "Explainable MathemaGraph-LLM" (EMG-LLM), that integrates LLMs with dynamically constructed mathematical knowledge graphs to achieve explainable and robust mathematical reasoning. In this hybrid architecture, the LLM interacts with a dedicated module that manages a problem-specific Knowledge Graph (KG). As the LLM reasons through a mathematical problem, it proposes steps (e.g., applying a theorem, performing a calculation, defining a variable). These proposed steps are translated into operations on the KGâ€”adding nodes representing concepts, intermediate results, or mathematical entities, and edges representing logical deductions, dependencies, or transformations. Critically, the KG provides a structured representation of the reasoning state, allowing for validation checks at each step (e.g., confirming theorem applicability, variable definitions) before updating the graph. The final KG serves as a formal, verifiable, and visualizable trace of the entire reasoning process. This approach aims to leverage the generative power of LLMs for proposing reasoning steps while using the structured nature of KGs to enforce logical consistency, mitigate hallucinations, and provide inherent explainability.

*   **Research Objectives:** This research aims to:
    1.  **Design and Develop the EMG-LLM Architecture:** Define the specific components of the hybrid system, including the LLM core, the dynamic KG representation suitable for mathematical reasoning, the KG interaction module responsible for parsing LLM outputs and updating the graph, and the explainability interface.
    2.  **Implement Dynamic KG Construction and Interaction:** Develop algorithms for the KG interaction module to interpret LLM-generated reasoning steps, validate them against the current graph state and mathematical rules, and update the KG accordingly in real-time during the problem-solving process.
    3.  **Evaluate System Performance:** Empirically assess the EMG-LLM's effectiveness on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Evaluation will focus on:
        *   **Accuracy:** The rate of correctly solving mathematical problems compared to baseline LLMs and potentially other LLM+KG approaches.
        *   **Explainability:** The quality, faithfulness, and interpretability of the generated reasoning graphs as explanations.
        *   **Robustness:** The system's ability to handle complex multi-step problems and its reduced tendency for logical errors and hallucinations compared to standard LLMs.
    4.  **Analyze Reasoning Capabilities:** Investigate how the dynamic KG influences the LLM's reasoning, particularly its ability to maintain long-range coherence and perform structured, multi-step deductions.

*   **Significance:** This research directly addresses the critical challenge of explainability and trustworthiness in AI-driven mathematical reasoning. By producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces, EMG-LLM has the potential to significantly enhance the reliability of LLMs in:
    *   **Education:** Providing students with step-by-step, verifiable solutions and tutoring assistance, especially in resource-limited settings.
    *   **Scientific Research & Engineering:** Assisting researchers in complex derivations, proof verification, and model building by providing auditable reasoning steps.
    *   **Finance:** Enabling more transparent and verifiable quantitative modeling and analysis.
    *   **AI Development:** Contributing to a deeper understanding of how to instill robust, explainable reasoning capabilities in LLMs, moving beyond current limitations.
    This work aligns directly with the workshop's guiding theme by exploring the extent to which ML models can "comprehend" mathematics through structured reasoning, and by proposing concrete applications arising from enhanced explainability and reliability. It also contributes to addressing key challenges highlighted in the literature, such as explainability, handling complex reasoning, and reducing hallucinations (Luo et al., 2023b; Azerbayev et al., 2023).

**3. Methodology**

*   **Research Design:** We propose a hybrid architecture, EMG-LLM, comprising the following key components:
    1.  **LLM Core:** A state-of-the-art pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-3, Gemini) potentially fine-tuned on mathematical texts and problem-solving dialogues. This LLM will serve as the primary reasoning engine, generating hypotheses and proposing steps.
    2.  **Dynamic Mathematical Knowledge Graph (DMKG):** A graph $G = (V, E)$ constructed specifically for each problem instance.
        *   **Nodes ($V$):** Represent mathematical entities (numbers, variables, constants), concepts (functions, sets, geometric shapes), operators (+, -, $\int$, $\frac{d}{dx}$), theorems/axioms (Pythagorean theorem, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus), intermediate results, and problem statements/goals.
        *   **Edges ($E$):** Represent relationships between nodes, such as `is_a` (variable 'x' `is_a` real number), `defined_as` (function 'f(x)' `defined_as` $x^2$), `depends_on` (result 'y' `depends_on` intermediate 'z'), `derived_using` (conclusion 'C' `derived_using` theorem 'T'), `equivalent_to` (expression 'A' `equivalent_to` expression 'B'). Edges capture the logical flow and dependencies.
    3.  **KG Interaction Module (KIM):** This module acts as the bridge between the LLM Core and the DMKG. Its functions include:
        *   *Parsing:* Interpreting the LLM's natural language or structured output representing a proposed reasoning step.
        *   *Validation:* Checking the proposed step's consistency and validity against the current state of the DMKG and potentially a background mathematical ontology. For example, ensuring variables are defined before use, theorem preconditions are met, or arithmetic operations are sound.
        *   *Graph Update:* Modifying the DMKG by adding/updating nodes and edges based on validated LLM steps.
        *   *Contextualization:* Querying the DMKG to extract relevant context (e.g., definitions, previous results) to feed back into the LLM prompt for subsequent steps.
    4.  **Explainability Interface:** A module responsible for translating the final DMKG $G_{final}$ into a human-understandable format. This could be a textual step-by-step derivation, a visual graph representation, or a combination thereof.

*   **Data Collection and Preparation:**
    *   **Datasets:** We will utilize a diverse set of publicly available mathematical reasoning benchmarks to train (if fine-tuning is employed) and evaluate the EMG-LLM system. These will span different difficulty levels and mathematical areas:
        *   *Arithmetic & Algebra:* GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021).
        *   *High School & Competition Math:* MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021), potentially subsets of competition benchmarks like PutnamBench (Tsoukalas et al., 2024) or Omni-MATH (Gao et al., 2024).
        *   *University Level Math / Formal Math:* Relevant subsets from U-MATH (Chernyshev et al., 2024), MathBench (Liu et al., 2024), FrontierMath (Glazer et al., 2024), or potentially ProofNet (Azerbayev et al., 2023) if adapted for step-by-step reasoning traces. We will prioritize datasets that either include intermediate steps/solutions or where they can be reasonably inferred or annotated.
    *   **KG Schema:** We will define a flexible schema for the DMKG, specifying node types and edge types relevant to broad mathematical reasoning. This might involve leveraging existing mathematical ontologies (e.g., OMDoc) or developing a tailored schema.
    *   **Base Knowledge:** We may initialize the system with a small, static background KG containing fundamental mathematical axioms, definitions, and common theorems relevant to the target domain(s).

*   **Algorithmic Steps:** The core problem-solving process for a given mathematical problem $P$ proceeds as follows:
    1.  **Initialization:**
        *   Input: Mathematical problem $P$.
        *   Initialize an empty or minimally-seeded DMKG, $G_0$. Nodes representing initial entities and conditions from $P$ are added.
    2.  **Iterative Reasoning Loop (for step $i = 1, 2, ...$):**
        a.  **Contextual Prompting:** Construct a prompt for the LLM Core. The prompt includes the original problem $P$, a summary or relevant subgraph of the current DMKG $G_{i-1}$, and a task instruction (e.g., "Based on the current reasoning state, propose the next logical step towards solving the problem.").
        b.  **LLM Step Proposal:** The LLM Core generates a candidate reasoning step $s_i$. This step might be expressed in natural language (e.g., "Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle ABC") or a more structured format.
        c.  **Parsing and Validation (KIM):**
            *   The KIM parses $s_i$ to identify the intended operation (e.g., applying a theorem, performing a calculation, algebraic manipulation, defining a term) and its arguments (e.g., specific nodes/entities in $G_{i-1}$).
            *   The KIM validates $s_i$ against $G_{i-1}$ and mathematical rules. Validation checks might include:
                *   Are all referenced entities (variables, theorems) defined in $G_{i-1}$?
                *   Are the preconditions for applying a theorem met by the entities in $G_{i-1}$?
                *   Is the proposed calculation arithmetically/algebraically sound based on inputs from $G_{i-1}$? (Potentially using a symbolic math engine like SymPy for verification).
                *   Does the step introduce contradictions with existing information in $G_{i-1}$?
            *   Let $v_i = \text{Validate}(s_i, G_{i-1}) \in \{\text{Valid}, \text{Invalid}, \text{Uncertain}\}$. This validation step directly leverages the structured information in the KG, drawing on approaches like graph-constrained decoding (Luo et al., 2024) or faithfulness checks used in KG reasoning (Luo et al., 2023a).
        d.  **Graph Update or Re-prompting (KIM):**
            *   If $v_i = \text{Valid}$: The KIM updates the graph: $G_i = \text{Update}(G_{i-1}, s_i)$. New nodes (e.g., for the result of the calculation) and edges (e.g., `derived_using`, `depends_on`) are added to reflect step $s_i$.
            *   If $v_i = \text{Invalid}$: Feedback is provided to the LLM Core (e.g., "Invalid step: Theorem preconditions not met. Please propose a different step."). Return to step 2a with updated context including the error feedback. This loop helps correct reasoning paths and reduce hallucinations.
            *   If $v_i = \text{Uncertain}$: The system might proceed but flag the step, or request clarification from the LLM or potentially a human supervisor.
        e.  **Termination Check:** Examine $G_i$. Has a node representing the final solution/proof been reached? Has a maximum step count been exceeded? Is the LLM unable to propose further valid steps? If a termination condition is met, exit the loop.
    3.  **Output Generation:**
        *   Solution: Extract the final answer/conclusion from $G_{final}$.
        *   Explanation: Use the Explainability Interface to render $G_{final}$ into a human-readable explanation (e.g., sequence of steps derived from graph traversal, graph visualization).

*   **Experimental Design:**
    *   **Baselines:** We will compare EMG-LLM against:
        1.  **Base LLM (Zero-shot):** The same LLM core without KG integration, prompted directly to solve the problem.
        2.  **Base LLM (Few-shot / CoT):** The LLM core prompted with few-shot examples or Chain-of-Thought instructions (e.g., "Think step-by-step").
        3.  **Relevant LLM+KG Methods:** If feasible, adapt and evaluate existing frameworks like RoG (Luo et al., 2023b) or GCR (Luo et al., 2024) on the mathematical reasoning tasks, acknowledging they might require modification from their original KGQA focus. Compare against proof-generation systems where applicable (Li et al., 2025).
    *   **Setup:** Experiments will be run on the selected datasets. We will perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components (e.g., validation strictness, KG schema design).

*   **Evaluation Metrics:** We will use a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics:
    1.  **Accuracy:** Percentage of problems solved correctly (final answer accuracy).
    2.  **Explainability Metrics:**
        *   *Faithfulness:* Assess whether the generated explanation (DMKG) accurately reflects the process that led to the solution. This can be measured partially by checking if intermediate results in the graph match ground truth steps (if available) or via human evaluation scoring the logical consistency between steps in the explanation. Define a metric $\mathcal{F}$ based on alignment score or human rating.
        *   *Interpretability/Clarity:* Human evaluation via user studies. Raters assess the clarity and understandability of the generated explanations (e.g., using Likert scales). Metric $\mathcal{I}$.
        *   *Completeness:* Evaluate if the explanation includes all necessary steps or identifies gaps. Metric $\mathcal{C}$.
    3.  **Robustness Metrics:**
        *   *Error Analysis:* Qualitative analysis of error types made by EMG-LLM vs. baselines (e.g., factual errors, logical fallacies, calculation mistakes, hallucinations). Measure the reduction in hallucination rate $\mathcal{H}$.
        *   *Performance on complex problems:* Evaluate accuracy specifically on problems requiring multiple reasoning steps (> N steps).
    4.  **Efficiency:** Measure the computational overhead (time, memory usage) introduced by the KG interaction compared to baseline LLMs.
