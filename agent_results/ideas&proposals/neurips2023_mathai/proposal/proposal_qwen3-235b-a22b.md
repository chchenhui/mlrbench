# **Explainable Mathematical Reasoning through Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Large Language Models**

---

## **1. Introduction**

### **Background**
Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of human intelligence, enabling the synthesis of abstract concepts, logical inference, and problem-solving across disciplines such as science, engineering, and finance. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling mathematical problems, from algebraic manipulations to theorem proving. However, these models often operate as **black-box systems**, making their decision-making processes opaque to users. This lack of interpretability limits their applicability in high-stakes domains like education and autonomous systems, where explaining errors or verifying intermediate steps is critical. Additionally, LLMs frequently struggle with **multi-step mathematical reasoning**, as small errors in intermediate steps propagate and corrupt final results—a challenge known as **hallucination** or **reasoning collapse** (Zhang et al., 2023).  

Recent efforts, such as **ProofNet** (Azerbayev et al., 2023) and **KG-GPT** (Kim et al., 2023), have sought to integrate **knowledge graphs (KGs)** into LLMs to constrain decoding steps and align outputs with formal mathematical knowledge. While these frameworks achieve fidelity improvements by grounding reasoning in structured representations, they either limit dynamic exploration of reasoning paths or do not explicitly model explainability. Our work advances this direction by proposing a **hybrid system that dynamically constructs mathematical reasoning graphs** during problem-solving, where nodes represent concepts, theorems, or intermediate computations, and edges encode logical dependencies. This design ensures that every inference is both **auditable** (i.e., the chain of reasoning can be visualized) and **manageable** (i.e., specific steps can be manually corrected or iterated).  

### **Research Objectives**  
1. **Design a hybrid architecture** that integrates KG-based reasoning graphs with LLMs to enable explainable mathematical reasoning.  
2. **Develop and evaluate a dynamic graph construction mechanism** that tracks the evolution of reasoning steps in real-time.  
3. **Quantify the trade-off between explainability and accuracy**, comparing our approach to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on diverse mathematical benchmarks.  
4. **Deploy the system in educational and scientific applications** to validate its practical utility.  

### **Significance**  
This work addresses critical gaps in AI-driven mathematical reasoning:  
- **Trustworthiness**: Visible reasoning graphs empower educators, researchers, and auditors to validate outputs, reducing risks of incorrect or misleading solutions in critical domains.  
- **Error Mitigation**: Structured reasoning reduces error propagation in multi-step problems.  
- **Horizon Applications**: The framework enables real-time collaboration between humans and LLMs in proof verification, curriculum design, and theorem discovery.

## **2. Methodology**

### **2.1 Mathematical Reasoning Graph Construction**  
The core innovation is a **dynamic knowledge graph $G_t = (\mathcal{N}_t, \mathcal{E}_t)$** that maps problem-solving steps over time $t$.  

#### **Graph Nodes**  
- **Concept Nodes**: Represent foundational mathematical entities (e.g., "quadratic equation", "Cauchy-Schwarz inequality"). These are pre-extracted from formal libraries like **MathWiki** (Zhang et al., 2022) or **Lean** (Buzzard et al., 2022).  
- **Theorem Nodes**: Store proprieties (e.g., "Pythagorean Theorem" with assumptions $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$). Theorems are formalized in **HOList** (Bansal et al., 2019) for logical compatibility.  
- **Computational Nodes**: Encode transient values (e.g., numerical results, symbolic expansions).  

#### **Graph Edges**  
Edges $e_{ij} \in \mathcal{E}_t$ represent:  
1. **Logical Dependencies**: $A \rightarrow B$ implies that concept $A$ is required to derive $B$.  
2. **Causal Relationships**: $x_3 = f(x_1, x_2)$ ($x_1, x_2, x_3$ are computational nodes).  
3. **Temporal Order**: Chronological progression of reasoning steps.  

#### **Graph Initialization**  
For a problem input $P$, $G_0$ is populated with all relevant nodes $n_i$ whose embeddings $v_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ (computed via **Sentence-BERT** (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019)) are within cosine similarity $\tau=0.85$ of $P$.  

### **2.2 Integration with LLMs**  
#### **Step 1: Prompt Engineering**  
The LLM receives two inputs:  
1. **Problem Statement**: $P = \text{"Solve } \int x^2 \sin(x) dx$."  
2. **Graph Context**: Structured representation of $G_t$ (nodes, edges, metadata) in JSON.  

To align the LLM with the graph-based workflow, we prepend a prefix:  
```
You are solving a mathematical problem using a reasoning graph. At each step:
1. Select a node/project a step using graph relationships.  
2. Update the graph with new hypotheses/train of thought.  
3. Generate the final answer grounded in the graph.
```  

#### **Step 2: Attention over Graph Relationships**  
We modify the LLM's attention mechanism to prioritize graph-aware tokens. Let $\mathcal{A}_t \subseteq \mathcal{N}_t$ be the active nodes at time $t$. For token $s_j$ in the LLM's context, the attention weight $\alpha_j$ is computed as:  
$$
\alpha_j = \text{Softmax}\left(\frac{v_{\text{LLM}}(s_j)^\top V_{\mathcal{A}_t}}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right),
$$  
where $V_{\mathcal{A}_t}$ is the set of node embeddings in $\mathcal{A}_t$.  

#### **Step 3: Graph Refinement**  
During LLM decoding, the model outputs a **reasoning step** and a **graph update command**. For example:  
- *Step*: "Apply integration by parts with $u = x^2, dv = \sin{x} dx$."  
- *Update*: {"add_node": "Integration by Parts Formula", "edges": ["x^2 → Integration by Parts", "sin(x) → Integration by Parts"]}.  

The graph expands dynamically, ensuring that each new node links to at least one predecessor (unless it is a base premise).  

### **2.3 Training Protocol**  
#### **Dataset Curation**  
We combine:  
1. **U-MATH** (Chernyshev et al., 2024): University-level calculus, linear algebra, and discrete math problems.  
2. **ProofNet**: Formalized undergrad proofs (500+ theorems).  
3. **Custom Problems** from textbooks like *Art of Problem Solving* (AOPS) and **Gowers' Mathematics Texts**.  

#### **Fine-tuning**  
A 3B-parameters LLM is fine-tuned (learning rate $10^{-5}$, batch size 32, AdamW optimizer) with the following losses:  
1. **Language Modeling Loss $L_{\text{LM}}$**: Standard cross-entropy over ground-truth outputs.  
2. **Graph Consistency Loss $L_{\text{GC}}$**: Encourages adherence to logical relationships. For each edge $(a, b)$, the LLM's reasoning must meet $a \vdash b$ (i.e., $a$ entails $b$) under a theorem prover like **Coq** (The Coq Team, 2023).  
3. **Explainability Loss $L_{\text{EX}}$**: Maximizes mutual information between the reasoning graph and the LLM's final answer. Let $G$ be the graph and $A$ the answer. Then:  
$$
L_{\text{EX}} = -I(G; A) \approx -\mathbb{E}_{G,A}\left[\log \frac{p(G|A)}{p(G)}\right].
$$  
This ensures answers depend directly on the reasoning chain.  

### **2.4 Evaluation Protocol**  

#### **Benchmarks**  
- **Primary**: U-MATH (Calculus, Abstract Algebra), MathBench (Multi-step problems), FrontierMath (Advanced topics).  
- **Secondary**: ProofNet (Formal proofs) and PutnamBench (Competition math).  

#### **Metrics**  
1. **Accuracy (Acc)**: Fraction of problems solved correctly.  
2. **Hallucination Rate (HR)**: Proportion of false statements in intermediate steps (detected via formal verification).  
3. **Explainability Scores**:  
   - **Coverage ($\mathcal{C}$)**: Average number of nodes referenced in the final answer.  
   - **Consistency ($\mathcal{S}$)**: Pearson correlation between manually valid reasoning paths and the LLM's generated graph.  
   - **Modularity ($\mathcal{M}$)**: SGX score (Kumar et al., 2022), measuring semantic coherence in subgraphs.  

#### **Baselines**  
- **KG-GPT** (Kim et al., 2023): Static graph+LLM pipeline.  
- **RoG** (Luo et al., 2023): Requires predefined relation paths.  
- **Vanilla LLM**: No graph integration.  

#### **Ablation Studies**  
We test variants:  
1. **Static vs. Dynamic Graphs**: Pre-built graphs vs. on-the-fly construction.  
2. **LLM-Driven vs. Theorem Prover-Driven**: Solely LLM updates vs. automated theorem prover (e.g., LEAN) guiding node additions.
