Title: Dynamic Neuro-Symbolic Benchmark for Mathematical Reasoning

Motivation:  
Static math‐reasoning benchmarks saturate quickly, offer limited domain coverage, and fail to distinguish genuine logical generalization from pattern memorization. A continually evolving, difficulty‐calibrated testbed would more accurately assess AI systems’ deep mathematical capabilities and drive sustained progress.

Main Idea:  
We propose a closed‐loop pipeline that integrates a proof assistant (Lean) with a large language model to generate, prove, and verify new theorems across algebra, analysis, and combinatorics. The system (1) samples formal libraries to propose candidate statements, (2) uses the LLM to draft proof sketches, and (3) checks and refines proofs in Lean. Each task is tagged by domain, proof‐length, dependency‐graph complexity, and novelty score to calibrate difficulty. New challenges are released incrementally, creating a living benchmark suite. Expected outcomes include a robust evaluation of zero‐ and few‐shot reasoning, resistance to overfitting, and a transparent progress tracker. By fostering community contributions of domains and proof techniques, this framework will guide architecture innovations, deepen AI mathematical reasoning, and set a new standard for rigorous, adaptive benchmarking.
