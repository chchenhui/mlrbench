**Title:** Holistic Evaluation of Mathematical Reasoning in AI: A Benchmark for Depth and Generalization  

**Motivation:** Existing benchmarks for evaluating mathematical reasoning in AI (e.g., MATH, GSM8K) focus on answer correctness but often fail to assess *how* models arrive at solutions. This limits insights into whether models genuinely reason or rely on surface-level patterns. A robust benchmark is critical to guide model development, especially as AI systems are increasingly applied in education, science, and safety-critical domains.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a benchmark that evaluates both **problem-solving steps** and **generalization across mathematical domains**. The benchmark will include:  
1. **Context-rich problems** requiring multi-step reasoning with real-world applicability (e.g., optimizing energy grids using calculus).  
2. **Dynamic difficulty tiers** that test incremental skill mastery, from algebraic manipulation to abstract theorem proving.  
3. **Distractor tasks** with plausible incorrect reasoning paths, forcing models to justify solutions logically.  
4. **Cross-disciplinary prompts** (e.g., physics-informed geometry) to assess transfer learning.  

The benchmark will leverage human expert annotations for step-by-step validity and collaborate with educators to align with pedagogical principles. By testing state-of-the-art LLMs, the study will quantify gaps in compositional reasoning and propose training strategies (e.g., curriculum learning, neurosymbolic integration) to address them. Expected outcomes include a public benchmark suite and actionable insights for improving reasoning depth in AI, advancing toward models capable of trustworthy, human-like mathematical understanding.
