**Title:** Neuro-Symbolic Proof Sketching for Automated Theorem Proving

**Motivation:** Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) systems often struggle with the vast search space inherent in finding complex proofs. Providing high-level guidance or a "proof sketch" can drastically prune this space, but generating such sketches automatically remains challenging. This research aims to bridge the gap between intuitive, human-like proof strategies and rigorous formal deduction.

**Main Idea:** We propose training a graph neural network (GNN) or a transformer model on a dataset pairing theorems with corresponding high-level proof sketches (represented as sequences of key lemmas/definitions or dependency graphs). The model learns to predict a plausible proof sketch given a new theorem statement. This neural-generated sketch would then guide a symbolic ATP system (like Lean or Coq) by prioritizing proof steps, lemmas, or tactics suggested by the sketch. This neuro-symbolic approach combines the pattern recognition strengths of neural networks for strategic guidance with the logical rigor of symbolic provers for final verification, potentially solving proofs intractable for either method alone.
