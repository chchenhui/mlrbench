**Key Challenges:**

1. **Ensuring Logical Validity**: Generating theorems that are both novel and logically valid remains a significant challenge, as neural models may produce syntactically correct but semantically incorrect statements.

2. **Balancing Creativity and Correctness**: Achieving a balance between generating innovative theorems and maintaining formal correctness is difficult, often requiring sophisticated mechanisms to guide the generation process.

3. **Integration of Symbolic and Neural Methods**: Effectively combining symbolic reasoning with neural networks to leverage the strengths of both approaches poses technical and conceptual challenges.

4. **Scalability of Reinforcement Learning**: Applying reinforcement learning to theorem generation involves managing large and complex search spaces, which can lead to scalability issues and computational inefficiencies.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Developing robust metrics to assess the quality, originality, and applicability of generated theorems is essential but challenging, as traditional evaluation methods may not capture all relevant aspects.
