**Title:** Neural-Symbolic Theorem Generation with Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Mathematical Discovery  

---

### 1. Introduction  

#### Background  
Automated theorem generation stands at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and mathematical reasoning, aiming to develop systems capable of synthesizing novel, logically valid theorems. Recent advances in neural models, such as transformers, have demonstrated promise in processing formal mathematical languages (e.g., Lean, Coq) and generating plausible conjectures. However, these models often produce outputs that lack formal validity or novelty, limiting their utility in collaborative mathematical discovery.  

Key challenges include:  
1. **Logical Validity**: Neural models may generate syntactically correct but semantically invalid statements.  
2. **Novelty-Correctness Trade-off**: Balancing creativity with adherence to formal rules remains unresolved.  
3. **Integration Challenges**: Combining neural flexibility with symbolic rigor demands innovative hybrid architectures.  

Prior work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for theorem proving (e.g., FGeo-DRL, QEDCartographer) and transformer-based conjecture generation (e.g., Johnson & Lee, 2023). While these approaches address aspects of theorem generation and validation, none fully integrate neural creativity with symbolic verification in a unified framework.  

#### Research Objectives  
This research proposes a neural-symbolic framework enhanced by RL to generate theorems that are both novel and formally valid. The objectives are:  
1. Develop a hybrid architecture combining transformer-based generation, RL-driven validation, and symbolic constraints.  
2. Design a reward mechanism using automated theorem provers (ATPs) to ensure logical correctness.  
3. Integrate a knowledge graph of mathematical concepts to guide novelty and contextual relevance.  
4. Establish evaluation metrics for theorem quality, originality, and downstream applicability.  

#### Significance  
This work aims to:  
- **Advance Collaborative Mathematics**: Enable AI to assist mathematicians by generating high-quality hypotheses for exploration.  
- **Bridge Neural and Symbolic AI**: Demonstrate how hybrid systems can leverage the creativity of neural networks and the rigor of symbolic logic.  
- **Accelerate Discovery**: Provide a scalable tool for generating and validating theorems in formal systems, reducing the time between conjecture and proof.

### 2. Methodology  

#### System Overview  
The framework comprises three core components:  
1. **Neural Generator**: A transformer-based model pre-trained on formal mathematical corpora to generate theorem candidates.  
2. **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: Uses ATP-derived rewards to refine the generator’s outputs.  
3. **Symbolic Knowledge Graph**: Encodes relationships between mathematical concepts to steer novelty.  

**Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
- **Training Data**: Curated theorem databases (e.g., Lean Mathlib, CoqGym) comprising formal statements and proofs.  
- **Knowledge Graph**: Constructed from theorem dependencies and concept co-occurrences. Nodes represent concepts (e.g., "group theory"), edges denote logical relationships (e.g., "implies").  
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenize formal statements into ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees) to capture syntactic-semantic structure.  

#### Algorithmic Steps  
1. **Pre-training**  
   - Train the transformer on formal theorem-proof pairs using a masked language modeling objective:  
     \[
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{MLM}} = -\sum_{i=1}^N \log P(t_i | t_{\setminus i}; \theta)
     \]
     where \( t_i \) is the \(i\)-th token in the theorem, and \( \theta \) are model parameters.  

2. **Candidate Generation**  
   - For input concept \( c \), sample a theorem \( t \) from the generator:  
     \[
     t \sim P(t | c; \theta)
     \]  

3. **Validation & RL Reward**  
   - Validate \( t \) using an ATP (e.g., Lean4). Define reward \( R(t) \):  
     \[
     R(t) = \underbrace{\alpha \cdot \text{Valid}(t)}_{\text{Correctness}} + \underbrace{\beta \cdot \text{Sim}(t, \mathcal{K})^{-1}}_{\text{Novelty}} + \underbrace{\gamma \cdot \text{Utility}(t)}_{\text{Applicability}}
     \]  
     where:  
     - \( \text{Valid}(t) \in \{0,1\} \) via ATP verification.  
     - \( \text{Sim}(t, \mathcal{K}) = \max_{t’ \in \mathcal{K}} \text{BLEU}(t, t’) \) measures similarity to existing theorems in knowledge base \( \mathcal{K} \).  
     - \( \text{Utility}(t) \) quantifies usage frequency of \( t \) in subsequent proofs (simulated via synthetic benchmarks).  
     - \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) are tunable weights.  

4. **Policy Optimization**  
   - Fine-tune the generator using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO):  
     \[
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}}(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}_{t \sim \pi_\theta} \left[ R(t) \right] + \lambda \cdot \text{KL}(\pi_\theta || \pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})
     \]
     where \( \text{KL} \) divergence ensures stable training.  

5. **Symbolic Constraint Enforcement**  
   - Apply type-checking and syntax validation via domain-specific grammars to ensure output adheres to formal language rules.  

#### Experimental Design  
- **Baselines**: Compare against TacticZero (RL-based prover), FGeo-DRL (neuro-symbolic reasoner), and transformer-only models.  
- **Datasets**:  
  - **Formalgeo7K**: Geometric theorems for domain-specific evaluation.  
  - **CoqGym**: Broad coverage of formal proofs for generalizability.  
- **Metrics**:  
  1. **Validity**: Percentage of generated theorems verified by ATPs.  
  2. **Novelty**: Jaccard similarity between generated theorems and training data.  
  3. **Applicability**: Success rate in downstream proof tasks (simulated via automated provers).  
  4. **Human Evaluation**: Expert mathematicians rate theorem usefulness on a 5-point scale.  
- **Ablation Studies**: Remove RL, knowledge graph, or symbolic constraints to assess individual contributions.
