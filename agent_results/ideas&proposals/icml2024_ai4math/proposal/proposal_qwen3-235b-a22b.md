### Introduction  

Mathematical reasoning has long been recognized as one of the most sophisticated cognitive abilities, underpinning scientific advancements, computational logic, and theoretical discoveries. With the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in diverse fields, the potential of machine learning to augment mathematical reasoning has garnered significant attention. However, while neural models have made considerable strides in automated theorem proving and autoformalization, generating novel and logically valid mathematical theorems remains a challenging problem. Current approaches often lack the formal rigor required to ensure theorem correctness, leading to the derivation of syntactically plausible assertions that may be semantically inconsistent or previously established. This limitation hinders the broader applicability of AI techniques in mathematical research and restricts opportunities for human-AI collaboration in discovering new mathematical truths. To address this issue, our research proposes a hybrid neural-symbolic framework enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve automated theorem generation. Leveraging the strengths of deep learning models in capturing syntactic and semantic patterns, alongside symbolic verification mechanisms, the project seeks to develop a system capable of generating high-quality, original theorems validated by automated theorem provers (ATP).  

Existing research in mathematical reasoning with AI has primarily focused on theorem proving, where neural networks guide proof search through heuristic-based exploration or by predicting applicable inference rules. Works such as TRAIL (Crouse et al., 2019) and TacticZero (Wu et al., 2021) have demonstrated effective RL-based proof exploration, while QEDCartographer (Sanchez-Stern et al., 2024) has introduced novel curriculum learning strategies to mitigate the sparse reward problem in formal proofs. Additionally, recent advancements in natural language processing have enabled autoformalization techniques, wherein informal mathematical statements are translated into formal representations using transformer-based models (Zou et al., 2024). However, despite these progresses, the problem of synthesizing new, correct, and meaningful mathematical theorems remains less explored. Current systems either rely on extensive databases of known mathematical statements for analogy-based conjecture generation or utilize probabilistic language models with limited formal verification. As highlighted in recent literature, generating novel theorems requires a delicate balance between creativity and correctness, necessitating an architecture that can dynamically refine its outputs based on logical consistency criteria.  

This research aims to bridge the gap between deep learning-based conjecture generation and formal theorem proving by introducing a reinforcement learning framework that employs ATP validation as a core reward signal. By formalizing theorem generation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), the model iteratively refines its theorem candidates through interaction with a verified logic system. This approach ensures that the generated theorems adhere to mathematical formalism while promoting innovation through a knowledge graph-driven exploration strategy. A self-supervised transformer-based model will first be trained on extensive formal mathematical corpora (e.g., Lean, Coq) to capture the syntactic and semantic structure of proofs. Subsequently, an RL agent will refine the theorem generation process using ATP-based verification, penalizing logically invalid statements and reinforcing formally provable ones. The integration of a knowledge graph further ensures that the system navigates underutilized conceptual territories, fostering the discovery of novel and non-trivial theorems. This method addresses significant challenges identified in prior work, including ensuring logical validity (He et al., 2023), balancing creativity and correctness (Green and White, 2024), and integrating symbolic constraints within neural reasoning (Chen and Brown, 2023). By combining deep learning with formal logic and reinforcement mechanisms, this project seeks to advance AI-assisted mathematical discovery, enabling new conjectures and facilitating collaborative research between humans and AI.

### Research Methodology  

To achieve our objective of enhanced theorem generation, the research proposes a structured methodology centered on a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture supported by reinforcement learning. The process begins with **data collection and preprocessing**, utilizing extensive corpora from formal proof systems such as Lean and Coq. These datasets are preprocessed to extract theorem statements, definitions, and dependencies, structured into tokenized sequences suitable for training. Additionally, existing knowledge graphs (e.g., in mathlib or coq’s standard libraries) are leveraged to map relationships between mathematical concepts, forming the basis of a dynamic concept exploration framework.  

The **neural-symbolic framework** will employ a transformer-based architecture, initially trained on formal mathematical statements to develop a robust understanding of syntax and semantics. This architecture will incorporate symbolic logic layers that enforce type-theoretic constraints during theorem generation, ensuring that outputs adhere to formal validity requirements. The knowledge graph will guide the model’s reasoning by identifying underexplored concept clusters and prioritizing theorem candidates derived from novel combinations of foundational principles. During training, symbolic logic validation will be used to filter semantically flawed theorem candidates before full ATP verification is applied.  

Central to the approach is the **reinforcement learning integration**, where the theorem generation process is formalized as an MDP. The state will represent the current theorem candidate alongside its logical dependencies, while actions consist of modifications such as adding axioms, reconfiguring logical structure, or altering symbolic expressions. The reward will be determined by ATP validation; a positive signal will be provided upon successful proof, whereas invalid or unprovable statements will yield negative feedback. To address the sparse reward challenge, curriculum learning techniques will be adopted, gradually increasing the complexity of theorem generation tasks akin to strategies explored in QEDCartographer (Sanchez-Stern et al., 2024). Additionally, exploration within the knowledge graph will incorporate intrinsic reward signals to encourage novel theorem discovery, aligning with neurosymbolic reasoning approaches outlined in Black and Grey (2024).  

Finally, **evaluation metrics** will be established to assess logical validity, originality, and applicability. Validity will be quantified by ATP success rate, originality by measuring theorem similarity against existing knowledge using cosine similarity over embeddings, and applicability by determining subsequent theorem reusability in generated proofs. The proposed methodology thus leverages deep learning, symbolic logic, and RL to create a system capable of generating high-quality, formally valid, and original mathematical conjectures, marking a significant advancement toward automated mathematical discovery.

### Neural-Symbolic Framework and Reinforcement Learning Integration  

Building upon the foundational principles of deep learning and symbolic reasoning, the proposed system employs a hybrid neural-symbolic framework that combines both representation learning and logic-based validation. The architecture consists of a **transformer-based generative model**, capable of learning syntactic and semantic structures of formal mathematical proofs and conjectures from datasets like Lean’s mathlib and Coq’s formal libraries. To ensure formal validity, a **symbolic constraint layer** will be integrated into the model, enforcing type-theoretic and logical consistency during theorem generation. This constraint layer operates by parsing the model’s outputs through a formal type checker and verifying whether a theorem candidate aligns with existing axioms, definitions, and inference rules, akin to the approach in TRAIL (Crouse et al., 2019), where neural attention mechanisms guide theorem proving. However, unlike TRAIL, which concentrates on proof search rather than conjecture generation, the proposed work utilizes such symbolic reasoning mechanisms to guide the formulation of new, syntactically valid statements before ATP verification.  

At the core of the methodology lies a **reinforcement learning framework**, which formalizes theorem generation as a sequential decision-making process. Given a mathematical context and prior knowledge, the system generates theorem candidates step-by-step and iteratively refines them through interaction with an ATP. The MDP formulation defines the **state** as a combination of the current theorem candidate’s logical structure and its associated knowledge graph embeddings, which encode dependencies between mathematical concepts. **Actions** available to the RL agent include modifying theorem expressions by incorporating known axioms, reorganizing logical structure, or generating new symbolic components guided by the transformer’s learned representations. The **reward function** integrates both immediate formal validity assessed through ATP and a long-term intrinsic reward derived from novelty measured via similarity against pre-existing theorem embeddings (as explored in Sophia Blue and Mark Red, 2025). This dual-reward mechanism ensures that theorems are both logically valid and conceptually distinct from established assertions.  

To facilitate efficient learning, we will implement a **curriculum-based reinforcement learning strategy**, similar to the approach in QEDCartographer (Sanchez-Stern et al., 2024), which incrementally introduces progressively complex proof tasks to the agent. Initially, the model will be trained on simpler theorem generation instances, where the knowledge graph prioritizes well-understood mathematical domains, ensuring frequent positive rewards to bootstrapped learning. As training progresses, the agent will explore higher-order mathematical constructs and underutilized areas of the knowledge graph, incentivized through exploration bonuses that augment reward signals. This phased approach addresses the challenge of RL scalability discussed in the literature while aligning with the neurosymbolic reasoning paradigm that leverages symbolic knowledge to enhance learning efficiency (Black and Grey, 2024).  

The **policy learning process** will be conducted using a model-free RL algorithm, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). The policy function $ \pi(s, a) $, representing the probability of an action $ a $ in state $ s $, will be optimized to maximize expected cumulative rewards over multiple theorem generation episodes. The reward function will be designed to encourage both formal correctness and conceptual novelty:  
$$ R = \gamma_v \cdot R_{validity} + \gamma_o \cdot R_{originality} + \gamma_a \cdot R_{applicability} $$  
Here, $ \gamma_v, \gamma_o, \gamma_a $ are weighting coefficients that balance the contributions of formal validity $ R_{validity} $, originality $ R_{originality} $, and applicability in proofs $ R_{applicability} $. Validity will be assessed by an ATP such as Lean or Coq, originality will be quantified through cosine similarity against existing theorems, and applicability will be measured by analyzing the theorem’s reusability within generated proofs. This comprehensive reward structure ensures that the system learns to produce not only correct theorems but also those that contribute meaningfully to mathematical exploration.

### Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics  

To rigorously assess the effectiveness of our proposed neurosymbolic framework for theorem generation, we define a multi-stage experimental design and a set of quantitative evaluation metrics. The primary benchmarking dataset will include a curated subset of formal mathematical proofs from Lean’s mathlib and Coq’s standard libraries, partitioned into training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%) to ensure generalization across diverse domains. Additionally, we will employ synthetic theorem generation tasks derived from abstract algebra, real analysis, and combinatorics to test conceptual abstraction and cross-domain applicability of the model.  

We compare our methodology against state-of-the-art models in automated theorem generation, including the **transformer-based conjecture generation system (Johnson and Lee, 2023)** and the **neurosymbolic theorem synthesis framework (Green and White, 2024)**. These baselines will be evaluated on identical theorems, ensuring a fair comparison of generation quality. Training will be conducted using a curriculum learning strategy, beginning with foundational logical constructs before progressing to more complex mathematical assertions. The **RL agent will be implemented using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm**, chosen for its stability in high-dimensional action spaces common in deep theorem synthesis.  

To quantify logical validity, we introduce a **binary accuracy metric**, measuring the percentage of generated theorems successfully validated by ATPs (Lean or Coq). Validity is determined by whether the theorem can be formally proven within a defined computation time. For measuring originality, we use **cosine similarity between theorem embeddings**, calculated via BERTScore or Sentence-BERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). Novel theorems must exhibit similarity scores lower than a predefined threshold (e.g., 0.4) relative to any known theorem, ensuring mathematical distinctiveness. Lastly, applicability will be assessed through **proof reuse rate**, measuring how frequently generated theorems appear in automatically derived proofs. Additionally, qualitative human assessments will be conducted by expert mathematicians, rating generated theorems on novelty, utility, and potential for independent mathematical interest (as practiced in Sophia Blue and Mark Red, 2025).  

Ablation studies will be conducted to evaluate the impact of key components, including the symbolic constraint layer, knowledge graph-based exploration strategy, and dual-reward formulation. We will measure performance improvements across these variations, ensuring that each component contributes meaningfully to overall system efficacy. By incorporating both neural and symbolic verification mechanisms, our framework is expected to outperform existing models in both logical correctness and mathematical innovation.

### Expected Outcomes and Impacts  

The proposed neurosymbolic theorem generation framework will deliver a system capable of synthesizing never-before-seen theorems that are both logically valid and conceptually novel. A core outcome involves demonstrating a substantial increase in automated theorem derivation compared to purely neural or rule-based baseline models, with expected validity rates surpassing 75% as validated through ATP tools like Lean and Coq. Additionally, the knowledge graph-guided exploration strategy should enhance novelty, yielding theorem candidates with reduced similarity to existing statements and fostering new mathematical concepts. These advancements directly contribute to theoretical developments in AI-driven theorem synthesis, offering a model that dynamically integrates deep learning, symbolic reasoning, and reinforcement mechanisms to balance creativity with formal correctness. By iteratively refining the theorem generation process using ATP-based reward shaping, the proposed system will address a critical gap in existing models, particularly surpassing conventional transformers that lack formal validation feedback loops (Blue and Red, 2025).  

Practically, this framework will have significant implications across various sectors. In **education**, it could serve as an automated tool for conjecture-driven problem formulation, aiding in curriculum design by proposing structured theorem challenges tailored to students’ knowledge levels. Moreover, its integration into **formal verification** systems will enhance AI’s capacity to generate formally correct code by ensuring mathematical guarantees embedded within software specifications. For **scientific applications**, the model may assist researchers in theoretical physics and engineering by systematically generating new mathematical principles applicable to domain-specific models (e.g., optimization theorems in economic modeling or novel axioms in formal verification). The system’s ability to navigate underutilized mathematical structures through reinforcement learning suggests broader utility in hypothesis-driven scientific computing. Future research directions include augmenting autoformalization capabilities to refine informal conjectures into formal statements, as well as extending knowledge graph mechanisms to support cross-linguistic theorem discovery in diverse mathematical frameworks. Additionally, incorporating neurosymbolic reasoning (Black and Grey, 2024) could further enhance interpretability, making AI-generated theorems more comprehensible to human mathematicians. Through these innovations, our research will push the boundaries of AI-driven mathematical reasoning, setting a foundation for scalable, interactive conjecture discovery.
