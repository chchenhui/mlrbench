# Neural-Symbolic Theorem Generation with Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Mathematical Discovery

## Introduction

Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of human intelligence, enabling the formulation of rigorous, logically valid statements and theories. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into mathematical discovery has the potential to revolutionize research by automating and augmenting human capabilities. However, the challenge of generating novel, logically valid theorems remains a significant hurdle. This research proposal outlines a hybrid neural-symbolic framework enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL) to generate formally valid theorems, aiming to bridge the gap between computational reasoning and theoretical advancements in mathematics.

### Background

The development of AI-driven mathematical reasoning systems has seen significant progress in recent years, with advancements in neural networks and symbolic reasoning. However, automating the generation of new and valid theorems is still a critical challenge. Current approaches often struggle to balance creativity and correctness, leading to syntactically correct but semantically incorrect statements. The integration of reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to address these challenges by providing a mechanism for learning and improving theorem generation strategies.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. **Develop a hybrid neural-symbolic framework**: Combine neural network models with symbolic logic to generate theorem candidates.
2. **Enhance theorem generation with reinforcement learning**: Utilize RL to refine and improve the quality of generated theorems.
3. **Ensure logical validity and novelty**: Develop mechanisms to validate the logical correctness and novelty of generated theorems.
4. **Evaluate and benchmark the system**: Establish robust evaluation metrics to assess the quality, originality, and applicability of generated theorems.

### Significance

The successful development of a system capable of generating high-quality, formally valid theorems could significantly accelerate mathematical discovery. By automating hypothesis generation, the system can help researchers explore new mathematical territories and collaborate more effectively with AI tools. Moreover, the insights gained from this research can contribute to the broader field of AI-driven mathematical discovery, offering novel perspectives on the interplay between machine creativity and formal rigor.

## Methodology

### Research Design

#### Data Collection

The research will utilize formal mathematics corpora, such as Lean and Coq, to train the neural-symbolic model. These corpora contain a wealth of mathematical theorems and proofs, providing a rich dataset for learning syntactic-semantic patterns. Additionally, a knowledge graph of mathematical concepts will be constructed to steer the generation of novel and relevant theorems.

#### Model Architecture

The proposed model consists of three main components: a neural network, an automated theorem prover (ATP), and a reinforcement learning agent.

1. **Neural Network**: A transformer-based model will be employed to learn syntactic-semantic patterns from the formal mathematics corpora. The model will generate theorem candidates based on these patterns.
2. **Automated Theorem Prover (ATP)**: The ATP will act as a reward signal in the RL framework, validating the logical correctness of generated theorem candidates. It will provide feedback to the RL agent, guiding the learning process.
3. **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: The RL agent will refine the generation process based on the feedback from the ATP. It will use the knowledge graph to ensure the novelty and relevance of generated theorems.

#### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Preprocessing**: The formal mathematics corpora are preprocessed to extract relevant features and construct the knowledge graph.
2. **Model Training**: The neural network is trained on the preprocessed data using a self-supervised learning approach. The RL agent is initialized with a random policy.
3. **Theorem Generation**: The neural network generates theorem candidates based on the learned patterns.
4. **Validation**: The ATP validates the logical correctness of the generated theorem candidates.
5. **Reward Assignment**: The RL agent receives a reward signal based on the validation results, guiding the learning process.
6. **Policy Update**: The RL agent updates its policy based on the received reward signal, refining the theorem generation process.
7. **Iteration**: Steps 3-6 are repeated, with the RL agent continually improving its policy and the neural network generating more accurate theorem candidates.

#### Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the system, the following metrics will be employed:

1. **Logical Validity**: The proportion of generated theorems that are logically valid, as determined by the ATP.
2. **Originality**: The originality of generated theorems, measured by their distance from existing theorems in the knowledge graph.
3. **Applicability**: The applicability of generated theorems to real-world mathematical problems, assessed by human experts.
4. **Computational Efficiency**: The time and computational resources required to generate and validate theorems.

### Experimental Design

To validate the method, the following experimental design will be employed:

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare the performance of the proposed hybrid neural-symbolic framework with existing methods for automated theorem generation.
2. **Human Expert Evaluation**: Assess the quality, originality, and applicability of generated theorems using human experts in mathematics.
3. **Scalability Analysis**: Evaluate the scalability of the RL-based approach by testing it on larger and more complex datasets.
4. **Robustness Testing**: Test the system's robustness by introducing variations in the input data and evaluating its ability to generate valid theorems under these conditions.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

1. **High-Quality Theorem Generation**: The development of a system capable of generating high-quality, formally valid theorems, validated for correctness and utility.
