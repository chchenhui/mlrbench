1. Title  
Multi-Level Contrastive Learning for Hallucination Reduction in Retrieval-Augmented Foundation Models  

2. Introduction  
2.1 Background and Motivation  
Foundation models (FMs), such as large‐scale pretrained language and vision models, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generation, reasoning, and few-shot adaptation. When deployed in real-world scenarios—particularly high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal advice, and finance—these models sometimes produce “hallucinations”: fluent but factually incorrect or unsupported statements. Hallucinations can erode user trust, propagate misinformation, and even lead to harmful decisions. Existing approaches to mitigate hallucinations largely fall into two categories: post-hoc detection (e.g., REFIND (Lee & Yu, 2025), ReDeEP (Sun et al., 2024)) and retrieval-augmented calibration (e.g., RAG-HAT (Song et al., 2024), Reducing Hallucination via RAG (Béchard & Ayala, 2024)). While effective to some extent, these methods either add significant inference overhead or treat hallucinations after they arise rather than preventing them during training.  

2.2 Research Objectives  
Our primary objective is to develop a unified, multi-level contrastive learning framework that fundamentally embeds factuality awareness into FMs during fine-tuning. Specifically, we will:  
• Design token-level contrastive objectives that sharpen the model’s discrimination between factual tokens and hallucinated tokens;  
• Introduce statement-level contrastive learning to push representations of true statements closer and push plausible-but-false statements apart;  
• Incorporate source-reliability contrastive losses that align generated outputs with high-quality retrieved evidence;  
• Integrate these levels into a retrieval-augmented training pipeline, enabling real-time verification and reducing hallucinations without sacrificing fluency or scalability.  

2.3 Significance  
A successful multi-level framework will  
• Reduce hallucination rates fundamentally rather than detect them post-hoc;  
• Enhance model reliability in critical applications (e.g., clinical QA, financial reporting);  
• Retain or improve expressive power and computational efficiency;  
• Offer a general recipe for safe, responsible deployment of FMs “in the wild,” addressing Workshop questions on reliability, responsibility, and practical limitations.  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Overview  
We propose to fine-tune a pretrained transformer-based FM with three complementary contrastive objectives, integrated with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Figure 1 (omitted) illustrates the pipeline: given an input query, a retriever fetches evidence passages; the FM encoder processes both query and evidence; the generator produces an output sequence; and three contrastive losses are computed at token, statement, and source levels.  

3.2 Data Collection and Preparation  
3.2.1 Hallucination Detection Dataset  
We will construct a multi-domain hallucination dataset with paired examples $(x, y^+, y^-)$ where $x$ is input context or query, $y^+$ is a verified factual output, and $y^-$ is a corresponding hallucinated output. Sources include:  
• Synthetic hallucinations generated by prompting GPT-4 with counterfactual constraints;  
• Annotated errors from public benchmarks (TruthfulQA, FEVER, FEVEROUS);  
• Domain-specific data (drug discovery QA using PubMed abstracts, legal opinion generation).  

3.2.2 Retrieval Corpus  
For RAG we will index large, high-quality corpora such as Wikipedia, PubMed, and specialized law and finance documents. We employ a dense retriever (e.g., DPR) to fetch top-$k$ passages $R(x) = \{r_1, \dots, r_k\}$ for each input $x$.  

3.2.3 Preprocessing  
All texts are tokenized with the FM’s tokenizer. We annotate factual spans in $y^+$ and hallucinated spans in $y^-$ at token level. We also label statement-level veracity for full sentences.  

3.3 Model Architecture and Base Loss  
We adopt a sequence-to-sequence transformer model (e.g., T5, LLaMA-variant). Given input $x$ and retrieved passages $R(x)$, the encoder produces contextual embeddings. The generator produces distribution $P_\theta(y\mid x,R(x))$ over the output vocabulary. The standard fine-tuning loss is the cross-entropy (CE) loss:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CE}} = -\sum_{t=1}^{T} \log P_\theta(y_t^+ \mid y_{<t}^+,\,x,\,R(x)).  
$$  

3.4 Multi-Level Contrastive Objectives  
3.4.1 Token-Level Contrastive Loss  
We mark factual tokens in $y^+$ as positives and hallucinated tokens in $y^-$ as negatives. Let $h_t$ be the hidden state of token $t$ in the generator. We sample positive examples $h_t^+$ and a set of negatives $\{h_t^-\}$. We define a standard InfoNCE loss:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{token}} = -\sum_{t\in\mathrm{pos}} \log\frac{\exp\bigl(\mathrm{sim}(h_t, h_t^+)/\tau\bigr)}  
{\exp\bigl(\mathrm{sim}(h_t, h_t^+)/\tau\bigr) + \sum_{j=1}^M \exp\bigl(\mathrm{sim}(h_t, h_j^-)/\tau\bigr)},  
$$  
where $\mathrm{sim}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is cosine similarity and $\tau$ a temperature hyperparameter. This encourages factual tokens to cluster in representation space, separated from hallucinated tokens.  

3.4.2 Statement-Level Contrastive Loss  
We treat each full statement (e.g., sentence) in $y^+$ as a positive example and its plausible-but-false counterpart in $y^-$ as negative. Let $s^+$ and $s^-$ be their pooled sentence embeddings (e.g., average of token embeddings). We use a margin ranking loss:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{stmt}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \max\bigl(0,\, \Delta - \mathrm{sim}(s_i, s_i^+) + \mathrm{sim}(s_i, s_i^-)\bigr),  
$$  
with margin $\Delta>0$. This pushes true statements closer to model predictions than false statements.  

3.4.3 Source-Reliability Contrastive Loss  
For each generated span $y^+$, we retrieve the best matching evidence passage $r^+$ from $R(x)$. We obtain passage embedding $e_{r^+}$ and output embedding $e_{y^+}$. We also sample unrelated passages $\{r^-_j\}$. We apply another InfoNCE loss:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{src}} = -\sum_{i=1}^B \log\frac{\exp(\mathrm{sim}(e_{y^+_i}, e_{r^+_i})/\tau)}  
{\sum_{j=0}^K \exp(\mathrm{sim}(e_{y^+_i}, e_{r^-_j})/\tau)},  
$$  
encouraging alignment between outputs and their supporting evidence.  

3.5 Joint Training Objective  
We combine all losses with weighting coefficients $\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta$:  
$$  
\mathcal{L} = \delta\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CE}} \;+\;\alpha\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{token}}  
\;+\;\beta\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{stmt}} \;+\;\gamma\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{src}}.  
$$  
Hyperparameters $\{\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,\tau,\Delta\}$ will be tuned on a held-out validation set.  

3.6 Algorithmic Steps  
Algorithm 1: Multi-Level Contrastive Fine-Tuning  
1.  Initialize FM parameters $\theta$ from pretrained checkpoint.  
2.  For each minibatch of input queries $\{x_i\}$:  
3.    Retrieve $R(x_i)$ for each $x_i$; preprocess to obtain $(y_i^+, y_i^-)$ pairs and evidence matches.  
4.    Forward pass to compute CE loss and all contrastive losses.  
5.    Compute joint loss $\mathcal{L}$ and backpropagate to update $\theta$.  
6.  End for  
7.  Save best model according to validation hallucination rate.  

3.7 Experimental Design  
3.7.1 Datasets and Domains  
We will evaluate on both open-domain and domain-specific benchmarks:  
• TruthfulQA (measuring factual QA accuracy and hallucination rate);  
• FEVER (fact verification);  
• Biomedical QA (BioASQ) using PubMed;  
• Legal opinion generation tasks from CaseLawQA.  

3.7.2 Baselines  
• Vanilla fine-tuned FM;  
• Retrieval-augmented FM without contrastive losses;  
• Iter-AHMCL (Wu et al., 2024) – model-level contrastive learning;  
• RAG-HAT (Song et al., 2024);  
• Hallucination Augmented Contrastive Learning (Jiang et al., 2023).  

3.7.3 Evaluation Metrics  
• Hallucination Rate: fraction of generated statements marked as hallucinated by human annotators or QA‐based automatic checkers;  
• Factual Accuracy: exact match / F1 on QA tasks;  
• Fluency & Perplexity: automatic measures to ensure language quality;  
• Retrieval Alignment: Context Sensitivity Ratio (CSR) (Lee & Yu, 2025).  

3.7.4 Ablation Studies  
We will disable each contrastive component (token, statement, source) in turn to measure its individual contribution. We will also vary retrieval quality (top-k, reranking) to assess robustness under resource constraints.  

3.7.5 Human Evaluation  
A crowd-sourced annotation on a subset of outputs will rate responses for factuality, coherence, and helpfulness.  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
4.1 Reduced Hallucination Rates  
We anticipate a substantial drop (≥ 20%) in hallucination rates relative to strong RAG baselines, particularly on domain-specific tasks where hallucination risk is highest.  

4.2 Improved Factual Accuracy  
By aligning model outputs with external evidence at source level and enforcing statement-level veracity, we expect ≥ 10% gains in QA accuracy on TruthfulQA and BioASQ.  

4.3 Maintained Fluency and Efficiency  
The additional contrastive objectives introduce minimal overhead during inference. We plan to demonstrate that perplexity remains on par with standard fine-tuning, preserving language quality.  

4.4 Broader Impacts  
Our framework addresses core challenges in deploying FMs in the wild:  
• Reliability & Responsibility: embedding factuality during learning reduces downstream harm;  
• Adaptivity: the multi-level design can be extended to new domains with domain-specific retrieval corpora;  
• Practicality: our approach integrates seamlessly with existing RAG pipelines and scales to large models.  

5. Conclusion & Future Work  
We have outlined a comprehensive research plan to mitigate hallucinations in foundation models using multi-level contrastive learning. By operating at token, statement, and source levels, our approach fundamentally shapes model representations to favor factual outputs and verifiable evidence. Future extensions include:  
• Incorporating user feedback loops for continual learning in deployment;  
• Adapting the framework to multimodal FMs, aligning images with text;  
• Extending to detect and mitigate subtle biases beyond factual errors.  

This work promises a significant step toward trustworthy AI systems “in the wild,” meeting the pressing needs of stakeholders across science, medicine, and society.
