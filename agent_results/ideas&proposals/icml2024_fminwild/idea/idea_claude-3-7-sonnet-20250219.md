# Multi-Level Contrastive Learning for Reducing Foundation Model Hallucinations

## Motivation
Hallucinations in foundation models (FMs) represent a critical reliability issue when deployed in real-world applications, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal advice, or financial services. These fabricated outputs, presented as factual information, can lead to misinformation, eroded trust, and potential harm. While techniques like fact-checking and model calibration exist, they typically address hallucinations after generation rather than preventing them fundamentally during the learning process, making this a pressing research challenge for reliable FM deployment.

## Main Idea
I propose a multi-level contrastive learning framework specifically designed to reduce hallucination tendencies during model training and fine-tuning. The approach operates at three levels: (1) Token-level contrastive learning to differentiate between factual and non-factual patterns in language generation; (2) Statement-level contrastive learning where models are trained to distinguish between verified facts and plausible-but-false statements; and (3) Source-reliability contrastive learning that helps models develop sensitivity to information provenance. This methodology would incorporate a specialized hallucination detection dataset comprising paired examples of factual outputs and corresponding hallucinations. The framework would integrate with retrieval-augmented generation to provide real-time verification capabilities during deployment. Expected outcomes include measurably reduced hallucination rates, particularly in domain-specific applications, with minimal impact on model expressiveness or computational efficiency.
