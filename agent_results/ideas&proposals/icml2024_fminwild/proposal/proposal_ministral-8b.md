# Title: Multi-Level Contrastive Learning for Reducing Foundation Model Hallucinations

## Introduction

Foundation models (FMs), such as large-scale language and vision models, have revolutionized various applications, from natural language processing to computer vision. However, their deployment in real-world scenarios presents significant challenges, particularly regarding hallucinationsâ€”fabricated outputs presented as factual information. Hallucinations can lead to misinformation, eroded trust, and potential harm, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal advice, and financial services. While post-generation techniques like fact-checking and model calibration exist, they often address hallucinations after generation, making prevention during the learning process a pressing research challenge.

This research aims to develop a multi-level contrastive learning framework to reduce hallucinations in foundation models. The proposed approach operates at three levels: token-level, statement-level, and source-reliability contrastive learning. These levels will differentiate between factual and non-factual patterns in language generation, distinguish verified facts from plausible-but-false statements, and develop sensitivity to information provenance, respectively. The framework will integrate with retrieval-augmented generation to provide real-time verification capabilities during deployment. This research is expected to yield measurably reduced hallucination rates, particularly in domain-specific applications, with minimal impact on model expressiveness or computational efficiency.

### Significance

The successful integration of foundation models into real-world applications necessitates a careful consideration of adaptivity, reliability, and efficiency. Reducing hallucinations is crucial for building trustworthy AI systems, especially in high-stakes domains. This research addresses the urgent need for reliable FM deployments, contributing to the broader goal of making AI useful and beneficial in society.
