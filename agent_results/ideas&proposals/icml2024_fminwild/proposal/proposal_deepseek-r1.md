# Multi-Level Contrastive Learning for Reducing Foundation Model Hallucinations in Real-World Deployments  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Foundation models (FMs), such as large language models (LLMs), have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling generalized reasoning across diverse tasks. However, their deployment in real-world applications—particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and legal services—is hindered by hallucination, where models generate factually incorrect or fabricated outputs. Hallucinations not only undermine trust in AI systems but also pose risks of misinformation and ethical harm. Current mitigation strategies, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and post-hoc fact-checking, often address symptoms rather than root causes. Recent studies (e.g., **ReDeEP** [1], **RAG-HAT** [8]) highlight that overreliance on parametric knowledge or insufficient alignment with external evidence exacerbates this issue. While contrastive learning has shown promise in reducing hallucinations (e.g., **Iter-AHMCL** [1], **Hallucination Augmented Contrastive Learning** [4]), existing methods focus on single-level representations or lack integration with real-time verification mechanisms.  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal seeks to develop a **multi-level contrastive learning framework** to reduce hallucinations in FMs during both training and inference. The approach targets three granularities:  
1. **Token-level**: Differentiating factual from non-factual token patterns in generated text.  
2. **Statement-level**: Distinguishing verified facts from plausible-but-false statements.  
3. **Source-reliability**: Encouraging sensitivity to information provenance via retrieval-augmented contrast.  
The framework will integrate with RAG systems to enable real-time verification, ensuring minimal computational overhead.  

### Significance  
By addressing hallucinations at multiple representation levels, this work aims to enhance FM reliability in critical applications while preserving their generative diversity. Successful outcomes will directly support ethical AI deployment in domains requiring high factual fidelity, such as medical diagnostics and legal document analysis.

## 2. Methodology  

### Data Collection  
A hybrid dataset combining synthetic and real-world hallucination examples will be constructed:  
- **Base Data**: Leverage existing benchmarks like **Bi'an** [6] (bilingual hallucination detection) and **ReEval** [10] (adversarial examples).  
- **Domain-Specific Augmentation**: Collaborate with domain experts to annotate hallucinations in healthcare (e.g., clinical notes) and finance (e.g., earnings reports).  
- **Retrieval Corpus**: Integrate domain-specific knowledge bases (e.g., PubMed for healthcare) to support RAG-based verification.  

Each sample will include:  
- A **query** (e.g., "Summarize the side effects of Drug X").  
- A **factual output** (human-verified).  
- A **hallucinated output** (generated by perturbing facts or omitting evidence).  
- **Retrieved evidence** from trusted sources.  

### Multi-Level Contrastive Learning Framework  
#### Token-Level Contrastive Learning  
For each token $t_i$ in the generated sequence, contrast its embedding $f_{t_i}$ against factual ($f^+_{t_i}$) and hallucinated ($f^-_{t_i}$) variants using an NT-Xent loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{token}} = -\log \frac{\exp(s(f_{t_i}, f^+_{t_i}) / \tau)}{\sum_{j=1}^N \exp(s(f_{t_i}, f^-_{t_j}) / \tau)}
$$  
where $s(\cdot)$ is a similarity metric (e.g., cosine), $\tau$ is a temperature parameter, and $N$ is the number of negative samples.  

#### Statement-Level Contrastive Learning  
Given a generated statement $s$ and its paired factual ($s^+$) and hallucinated ($s^-$) counterparts, compute sentence embeddings ($e_s, e_{s^+}, e_{s^-}$) via a pretrained encoder. Optimize:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{stmt}} = \mathbb{E}_{(s, s^+, s^-)} \left[ -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(e_s, e_{s^+}) / \tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(e_s, e_{s^+}) / \tau) + \exp(\text{sim}(e_s, e_{s^-}) / \tau)} \right]
$$  

#### Source-Reliability Contrastive Learning  
Train the model to prefer retrieved evidence over parametric knowledge using a margin-based loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{source}} = \max(0, \alpha + s_{\text{parametric}} - s_{\text{retrieval}})
$$  
where $s_{\text{parametric}}$ and $s_{\text{retrieval}}$ are confidence scores for outputs generated from parametric memory vs. retrieved evidence, and $\alpha$ is a margin.  

#### Total Loss  
The combined training objective is:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{token}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{stmt}} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{source}}
$$  
Hyperparameters $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ balance the contributions of each loss component.  

### Integration with Retrieval-Augmented Generation  
During inference, the framework dynamically retrieves relevant evidence using a vector database (e.g., FAISS) and computes a **reliability score** $r$ for each generated token:  
$$
r(t_i) = \frac{\exp(s(f_{t_i}, f_{\text{retrieved}}))}{\exp(s(f_{t_i}, f_{\text{retrieved}})) + \exp(s(f_{t_i}, f_{\text{parametric}}))}
$$  
Tokens with $r(t_i) < \beta$ trigger a revision process using the retrieved context.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Expected Outcomes  
1. A **10–20% reduction in hallucination rates** compared to baselines, as measured on the **Bi'an** benchmark.  
2. Minimal degradation in generative diversity (e.g., <5% drop in perplexity on the WikiText-103 benchmark).  
3. **Latency <500ms per query** in RAG-integrated deployment, making the framework suitable for real-time applications.  

### Broader Impact  
- **Ethical AI Deployment**: Reduced hallucinations will enhance trust in AI systems for medical advice, legal documentation, and financial forecasting.  
- **Resource Efficiency**: The contrastive framework’s modular design allows deployment on edge devices, addressing computational constraints in low-resource settings.  
- **Benchmark Advancement**: The hybrid hallucination dataset will support standardized evaluation across domains.  

By preemptively addressing hallucinations at multiple granularities, this work will enable safer, more reliable integration of FMs into societal frameworks—directly aligning with the Workshop on FMs in the Wild’s mission.
