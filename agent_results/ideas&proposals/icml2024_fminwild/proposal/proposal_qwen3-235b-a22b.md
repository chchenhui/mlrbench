### Introduction: Addressing Hallucinations in Foundation Models  

Foundation models (FMs), particularly large-scale language models (LLMs), have revolutionized modern artificial intelligence by demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning across various domains. Their applications extend to healthcare, education, finance, and scientific research, where their ability to synthesize information from vast datasets enables powerful decision-making and knowledge dissemination. However, despite their transformative potential, a fundamental challenge persists in real-world deployments—hallucinations, where models generate outputs that appear coherent and factual but are, in reality, incorrect or entirely fabricated. These hallucinations pose significant reliability concerns, especially in high-stakes industries such as medical diagnostics, legal document processing, and financial forecasting, where errors can directly impact human well-being, legal accountability, and economic stability. As underscored in the Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild, ensuring adaptability, responsibility, and efficiency in FM deployment is essential for their real-world utility, and addressing hallucinations is a crucial step toward achieving these goals.  

Existing approaches to hallucination mitigation primarily fall into two categories: post-hoc detection and generative modifications. Post-hoc techniques, such as those proposed by ReDeEP and REFIND, focus on identifying hallucinations after generation by analyzing how models utilize external knowledge relative to their parametric knowledge. These methods often rely on interpretability tools to distinguish between reliable and unreliable model behaviors. On the other hand, generative approaches seek to improve factual consistency at the model level. RAG-HAT, for example, fine-tunes LLMs using hallucination-corrected responses, while Iter-AHMCL modifies internal representations through model-level contrastive learning. Additionally, recent efforts like Hallucination Augmented Contrastive Learning (HACL) have explored contrastive strategies to align multimodal representations and reduce hallucations in multimodal settings. Nevertheless, a major limitation of these approaches is their reliance on detecting hallucinations after generation rather than fundamentally preventing them within the learning process itself. This reactive stance limits their effectiveness in mission-critical applications, where even a single factual inaccuracy can compromise trust and real-world impact.  

Reducing hallucination tendencies during training and fine-tuning is crucial for enhancing model reliability. While contrastive learning has demonstrated success in representation refinement, current methods often lack a multi-level approach that simultaneously addresses token-level discrepancies, factual consistency, and source credibility. The proposed research fills this gap by introducing a framework that integrates contrastive learning at multiple levels—token, statement, and source—to enable FMs to better distinguish between factual and hallucinatory information. By doing so, the methodology aims to fundamentally reshape model learning, moving beyond reactive fact-checking to a proactive approach that minimizes the generation of erroneous content. This aligns with the workshop's call for responsible AI deployment, as it addresses adaptivity in domain-specific use cases while maintaining the model’s expressiveness and computational efficiency. Given the increasing prevalence of FMs in real-world systems, ensuring their factual reliability is essential for their trustworthiness and long-term viability, making this proposal a timely and critical addition to the field of foundation models in the wild.

### Methodology: Multi-Level Contrastive Learning Framework for Hallucination Reduction  

The core of this proposal is a multi-level contrastive learning framework designed to reduce hallucinations in foundation models (FMs) during training and fine-tuning. This methodology incorporates three key levels of contrastive learning: **token-level**, **statement-level**, and **source-reliability**, each addressing different facets of hallucinatory generation while ensuring factual consistency. A specialized hallucination detection dataset containing paired factual and hallucinated outputs will be used, and the framework will integrate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further enhance factual grounding.  

#### **Token-Level Contrastive Learning**  

Token-level contrastive learning focuses on refining the internal representations of language units within FMs to differentiate between factual and inconsistent outputs. In pre-trained language models, hallucinations often manifest through subtle token-level discrepancies, where seemingly valid yet incorrect combinations are generated. To counter this, the token-level contrastive approach will train the FM to distinguish between factual and hallucinated tokens by contrasting outputs against a dataset of verified knowledge. This dataset will be augmented with negative samples—token sequences that deviate from factual consistency through semantic manipulation or knowledge scrambling—and contrastive learning will be applied to minimize the distance between factual token embeddings while maximizing the distance to hallucinated ones.  

The training process will involve a contrastive loss function, such as InfoNCE loss, adapted for token-level alignment:  

$$
\mathcal{L}_{token} = -\log \frac{\exp(f(\mathbf{x}_f) \cdot f(\mathbf{x}’_n)/\tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^N \exp(f(\mathbf{x}_f) \cdot f(\mathbf{x}_k)/\tau)}
$$  

where $ \mathbf{x}_f $ is a factual token sequence, $ \mathbf{x}_k $ are negative samples from hallucinated sequences, $ f(\cdot) $ represents the model’s encoder or decoder state, and $ \tau $ is the temperature parameter controlling the similarity distribution sharpness. This loss function will encourage the model to internalize fine-grained factual consistency at the token level, reducing the likelihood of generating incoherent or misleading language.  

#### **Statement-Level Contrastive Learning**  

Beyond individual tokens, hallucinations often emerge at the statement level, where the model generates a sentence that syntactically appears correct but semantically misaligns with verified truth. To address this, we propose a structured statement-level contrastive training mechanism. This will require a dataset of factual statements with well-vetted knowledge (e.g., from biomedical publications, legal codes, or historical records) and a complementary set of plausible-yet-false statements generated through adversarial prompting or LLM-based hallucination augmentation.  

Statement-level contrastive learning will leverage a similarity-based loss, such as contrastive hinge loss, to penalize incorrect generalizations:  

$$
\mathcal{L}_{statement} = \max(0, \Delta - \|f(\mathbf{x}_f) - f(\mathbf{x}_{ver})\|_2 + \|f(\mathbf{x}_{f}) - f(\mathbf{x}_{hall})\|_2 )
$$  

where $ \mathbf{x}_{ver} $ is a verified statement, $ \mathbf{x}_{hall} $ is a hallucinated statement, and $ \Delta $ is the margin defining the acceptable similarity distance. By learning to differentiate between semantically similar yet factually distinct statements, the model will develop a stronger internal representation of truthful content.  

The framework will also incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) at this stage, ensuring that statement-level knowledge grounding is performed in conjunction with an external knowledge base. This will enable real-time verification of generated statements against authoritative sources, reducing hallucination while maintaining the model’s linguistic fluency and adaptability across domains.  

#### **Source-Reliability Contrastive Learning**  

A primary issue with hallucinations stems from an overreliance on parametric knowledge that is not externally verified. To rectify this, the proposed method will implement source-reliability contrastive learning to train FMs to assess the credibility of knowledge sources. This will necessitate a dataset containing not only factual and hallucinated statements but also their corresponding verifiable provenance, such as academic publications, trusted news articles, or scientific databases.  

The source-reliability contrastive approach will modify the model’s attention mechanisms to emphasize credible sources. Similar to Iter-AHMCL, which refines LLM layers using contrastive alignment, this framework will refine the model’s dependency on verified knowledge by contrasting outputs generated with and without source-aware context. A contrastive loss will be formulated using verified and hallucinated responses paired with their source contexts:  

$$
\mathcal{L}_{source} = \max(0, \Delta - \|f(\mathbf{c}_{ver}) - f(\mathbf{x}_{hall})\|_2 + \|f(\mathbf{c}_{ver}) - f(\mathbf{x}_f)\|_2 )
$$  

where $ \mathbf{c}_{ver} $ denotes a verified source context, $ \mathbf{x}_{hall} $ is a hallucinated output, and $ \mathbf{x}_f $ is the factual counterpart. This loss function will reinforce the model’s dependency on authoritative sources while diminishing its tendency to propagate information derived solely from internal knowledge stores prone to inaccuracies.  

#### **Dataset Curation and Integration with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  

To support the proposed framework, a specialized dataset will be curated from established benchmarks such as TruthfulQA, FactCheckQA, and the REFIND hallucination detection database. Additionally, hallucinated counterparts will be synthesized using techniques like LLM-based adversarial augmentation, knowledge inconsistency injection (e.g., through sentence reordering or entity substitution), and prompt engineering that encourages deviations from verified facts. The dataset will be structured to include triples of factual statements, hallucinated variants, and source provenance labels, ensuring the contrastive approach learns to associate reliable knowledge with accurate responses.  

To further reinforce factual grounding, retrieval-augmented generation will be seamlessly integrated into the framework. External retrieval mechanisms, such as dense passage retrieval (DPR) over curated knowledge bases, will provide real-time verification during training and inference. The FM will be trained to dynamically align its output with retrieval-based evidence, ensuring that hallucination reduction is not merely based on contrastive learning but also reinforced by external validation at the statement and knowledge source levels. This dual pathway—contrastive learning for internal representation refinement and RAG for knowledge grounding—will enable a robust hallucination mitigation framework capable of real-world deployment.

### Expected Outcomes and Advancements  

The proposed multi-level contrastive learning framework aims to significantly reduce hallucination rates in foundation models (FMs) while preserving their linguistic capabilities and domain adaptability. Key evaluation metrics will include **hallucination detection performance** (measured using F1 score relative to annotated benchmarks), **truthfulness metrics** (such as the percentage of factually correct responses on TruthfulQA and FactCheckQA), and **model coherence and fluency assessments** (evaluated via perplexity on benchmark datasets and human-rated fluency scores). Given that prior contrastive learning approaches like Iter-AHMCL have demonstrated hallucination reduction of up to 20-30% compared to standard LLMs, the multi-level framework introduced here is expected to yield even greater improvements, particularly in domain-specific settings where factual grounding is crucial.  

By simultaneously addressing hallucinations through **token-level**, **statement-level**, and **source-reliability** mechanisms, the framework is likely to surpass conventional post-hoc fact-checking and hallucination detection methods in terms of **model confidence calibration**. The contrastive learning approach, as highlighted in Heterogeneous Contrastive Learning for Foundation Models and Beyond, emphasizes multi-view alignment and task heterogeneity, which directly enhances a model’s ability to differentiate reliable knowledge from parametric biases. This should lead to improved **reliability of structured generation**, particularly in high-stakes domains like legal documentation, clinical health decision-making, and financial forecasting, where even a single hallucination can lead to severe consequences.  

Real-world impact-wise, this research provides a practical solution for deploying FMs in domains requiring high factual accuracy without compromising **computational efficiency**. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, including REFIND and Bi’an, suggest that source grounding can reduce hallucinations without requiring extensive retraining. By integrating contrastive learning with RAG, as proposed in RAG-HAT and ReDeEP, we can further enhance efficiency gains. This aligns with the Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild’s emphasis on **adaptivity**, **reliability**, and **computational efficiency** in FM deployment. The expected outcome—more robust and trustworthy AI systems—would allow FMs to be widely adopted in critical industries where hallucination errors are currently prohibitive.

### Impact and Societal Implications  

Reducing hallucinations in foundation models (FMs) is critical for building trust in AI-driven decision-making systems. In domains where factual accuracy is paramount—such as healthcare, legal services, and education—reliable language understanding and knowledge grounding determine whether AI-generated information can be accepted as authoritative. The proposed framework, by integrating multi-level contrastive learning, enhances the model's ability to distinguish between factual and fabricated content, ensuring greater confidence in its outputs. This aligns with the workshop’s objectives of improving **reliability and responsibility**, particularly in domains where errors can have tangible societal consequences. For instance, a reduction in hallucination rates would directly benefit applications like **diagnostic assistance in medicine**, where models must synthesize information from clinical trials, or **legal drafting**, where misinformation could lead to misinterpretations with legal ramifications. Additionally, as emphasized by Bi’an, hallucination detection in multilingual applications remains a pressing challenge, particularly in cross-cultural information retrieval and translation systems. The framework’s ability to integrate knowledge grounding through a source-reliability contrastive mechanism enables broader applicability across languages and domains, directly supporting the **safety, ethics, and fairness** criteria outlined in the workshop.  

Beyond factual accuracy, the proposed methodology also advances practical deployment by improving **computational efficiency** while maintaining model expressiveness. As highlighted in REFIND and ReDeEP, existing hallucination detection techniques often introduce computational overhead due to the need for secondary verification pipelines. The multi-level contrastive approach, however, refines the model internally, allowing hallucinated content to be discouraged at the generation stage. This minimizes the dependence on post-hoc corrections and reduces inference delays. Furthermore, as outlined in Heterogeneous Contrastive Learning for Foundation Models and Beyond, contrastive learning enhances multi-view training dynamics, improving generalization while mitigating redundancy. By implementing contrastive learning at the token, statement, and source levels, this research directly addresses the workshop’s challenge of balancing **adaptivity with efficiency**, ensuring that foundation models can be effectively deployed in real-world applications without incurring prohibitive computational costs. This advancement would enable scalable and accurate AI systems compliant with the highest standards of **trustworthiness and real-world usability**, particularly in high-stakes and socially impactful domains.
