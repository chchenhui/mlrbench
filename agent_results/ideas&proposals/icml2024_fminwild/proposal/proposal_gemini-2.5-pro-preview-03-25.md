## 1. Title:

**Mitigating Foundation Model Hallucinations through Multi-Level Contrastive Learning for Enhanced Real-World Reliability**

## 2. Introduction

**2.1 Background**
Foundation models (FMs), such as large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Llama, and vision models like CLIP, represent a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence. Pre-trained on vast datasets, they exhibit remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, images, and code, driving innovation across numerous fields including scientific research, communication, education, and creative arts (Bommasani et al., 2021). Their potential to transform industries and societal functions is immense.

However, the transition of these powerful models from controlled research environments to "in-the-wild" deployments reveals significant challenges, as highlighted by the Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild. One of the most critical issues undermining their reliability is the phenomenon of **hallucination** – the generation of plausible-sounding but factually incorrect, irrelevant, or nonsensical content (Ji et al., 2023). These fabricated outputs, often presented with high confidence, pose serious risks, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare (generating incorrect medical advice), finance (providing flawed market analysis), legal services (misstating legal precedents), and news generation (spreading misinformation). The occurrence of hallucinations erodes user trust, limits safe deployment, and presents a fundamental barrier to realizing the full potential of FMs in practical, real-world scenarios. Addressing hallucinations is paramount for ensuring adaptivity, reliability, safety, and ethical deployment – key concerns for developers, end-users, and society at large.

**2.2 Problem Statement**
Existing approaches to mitigate hallucinations often rely on post-hoc mechanisms. These include retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) which grounds responses in external knowledge (Lewis et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2023), fact-checking pipelines that verify generated claims against knowledge bases, and model calibration techniques aiming to align output confidence with actual likelihood. While beneficial, these methods primarily act *after* a potential hallucination has been generated or focus on *detecting* rather than *preventing* their formation during the core generation process. RAG systems themselves can still hallucinate if the retrieval is poor or if the model overly relies on its parametric knowledge despite contradictory retrieved evidence (ReDeEP, Sun et al., 2024; Chang et al., 2024). Detection methods (REFIND, Lee & Yu, 2025; Bi'an, Jiang et al., 2025) are crucial for evaluation but don't inherently fix the underlying generative tendency. Furthermore, some mitigation strategies might inadvertently constrain the model's creativity or fluency. There is a pressing need for methods that intrinsically discourage hallucination generation *during* the model's training or fine-tuning phase, fostering a deeper internal representation of factuality and source reliability.

**2.3 Proposed Research: Multi-Level Contrastive Learning**
This research proposes a novel **Multi-Level Contrastive Learning (MLCL)** framework designed to reduce the propensity of foundation models to hallucinate by embedding factuality awareness directly into their representations during the learning process. Unlike approaches that focus solely on post-hoc correction or detection, MLCL aims to fundamentally alter the model's internal knowledge representation and generative pathways. The core idea is to train the model to distinguish between factual/reliable information and plausible-but-false (hallucinated) information at multiple granularities:

1.  **Token-Level Contrastive Learning:** Encourages the model to differentiate between likely continuations that align with factual context versus those that deviate into hallucination, improving local sequence coherence and factuality.
2.  **Statement-Level Contrastive Learning:** Trains the model to distinguish the representation of a complete, verified factual statement from a corresponding plausible-but-false (hallucinated) counterpart, promoting global factual consistency.
3.  **Source-Reliability Contrastive Learning:** Aims to make the model's representations sensitive to the provenance or reliability of the underlying information source used during training or retrieval, associating higher reliability with factual outputs.

This multi-pronged approach, integrated into the training or fine-tuning objectives, seeks to instill a preference for factuality deep within the model's parameters. We hypothesize that by contrasting factual and hallucinated examples across these levels, the model will learn representations that are inherently more robust against generating fabricated content.

**2.4 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop the MLCL Framework:** Formulate and implement the multi-level contrastive learning objectives (token, statement, source) suitable for integration into the training or fine-tuning of large foundation models.
2.  **Curate Hallucination-Contrastive Datasets:** Construct or adapt datasets containing paired examples of factual information and corresponding plausible hallucinations, potentially annotated with source reliability information, suitable for training the MLCL framework across different domains.
3.  **Evaluate MLCL Effectiveness:** Empirically assess the impact of the MLCL framework on reducing hallucination rates in FMs using established benchmarks (e.g., TruthfulQA, HaluEval) and potentially domain-specific test sets (e.g., medical QA, legal summaries).
4.  **Analyze Trade-offs:** Investigate the effects of MLCL on other crucial model properties, including generative quality (fluency, coherence), performance on standard NLP tasks, and computational efficiency (training time, inference speed).
5.  **Explore Integration with RAG:** Investigate synergies between MLCL-trained models and RAG systems, assessing whether intrinsic factuality improvements enhance the overall reliability of retrieval-augmented responses.

**2.5 Significance**
This research directly addresses the critical challenge of reliability in foundation models, a central theme of the Workshop on FMs in the Wild. By focusing on *preventing* hallucinations through intrinsic model training, MLCL offers a potentially more fundamental solution than post-hoc methods. Success in this research would lead to:

*   **Enhanced Trustworthiness:** More reliable FMs that generate factually accurate information, fostering greater user trust and enabling safer deployment in sensitive applications.
*   **Improved Real-World Adaptability:** Models better equipped to handle domain-specific knowledge accurately during fine-tuning and deployment.
*   **Contribution to Responsible AI:** Development of techniques promoting ethical AI deployment by reducing the risk of disseminating misinformation.
*   **Scientific Understanding:** Deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying hallucination and how contrastive learning can shape FM representations for factuality.

This work aims to make a significant contribution towards making FMs more dependable tools for real-world societal benefit.

## 3. Methodology

**3.1 Conceptual Framework**
The MLCL framework introduces supplementary contrastive objectives during the training or fine-tuning of a foundation model. Contrastive learning aims to pull representations of similar (positive) items together in the embedding space while pushing dissimilar (negative) items apart (Hadsell et al., 2006; Oord et al., 2018). In our context, "similarity" is defined by factuality and reliability. The framework operates concurrently at three levels:

*   **Token-Level:** Focuses on local predictions. Given a context sequence $C = \{t_1, ..., t_{k-1}\}$, the model predicts the next token $t_k$. We contrast the representation associated with predicting a factually consistent next token $t_k^{fact}$ against representations associated with predicting plausible but incorrect (hallucinated) tokens $t_k^{hallu}$.
*   **Statement-Level:** Focuses on global representations of complete assertions. We contrast the representation of a full, verified factual statement $S^{fact}$ against the representation of a generated or curated plausible-but-false counterpart $S^{hallu}$.
*   **Source-Reliability Level:** Incorporates metadata about information origin. We contrast the representation of a statement $S$ generated or derived from a reliable source $Src^{high}$ against the representation of the same or similar statement $S'$ associated with an unreliable source $Src^{low}$ or generated without reliable grounding.

**3.2 Data Collection and Preparation**
A key component is the curation of suitable training data. We will need datasets containing triplets or pairs tailored for each contrastive level:

1.  **Token-Level Data:** Requires contexts $C$ and multiple possible next tokens, labeled as factual ($t_k^{fact}$) or hallucinated ($t_k^{hallu}$) with respect to $C$ and potentially external knowledge. This can be generated by:
    *   Using existing fact-checking datasets (e.g., FEVER, VitaminC) to identify factual claims and context.
    *   Employing a high-capacity FM (e.g., GPT-4) prompted to generate both factual and plausible-but-false continuations for given contexts, followed by verification using external knowledge sources (search engines, knowledge bases) and potentially human annotation for quality control.
    *   Leveraging datasets designed for hallucination detection (e.g., parts of HaluEval, Bi'an benchmark data).

2.  **Statement-Level Data:** Requires pairs of ($S^{fact}$, $S^{hallu}$). These can be sourced from:
    *   Existing hallucination benchmarks providing sentence-level labels.
    *   Generating variations: Taking a known factual statement $S^{fact}$ and using an FM to generate paraphrased but factually incorrect versions ($S^{hallu}$). Verification is crucial.
    *   Mining question-answering datasets: Pairing correct answers ($S^{fact}$) with incorrect answers generated by baseline FMs ($S^{hallu}$) for the same question.

3.  **Source-Reliability Data:** Requires statements associated with source information, rated for reliability. This could involve:
    *   Using news datasets or scientific literature datasets where sources (e.g., reputable journals vs. preprints vs. blogs) can be heuristically categorized.
    *   In an RAG context, labeling retrieved documents based on domain/authority and contrasting representations based on whether the generated statement aligns more with high-reliability vs. low-reliability retrieved evidence.
    *   Synthetically generating data: Prompting FMs to produce statements reflecting information from specified high-reliability (e.g., textbook knowledge) vs. low-reliability (e.g., fictional narrative) sources.

We will prioritize creating datasets relevant to specific domains identified as high-stakes (e.g., medical information, financial news) in addition to general domain data. Data quality control through automated checks and human verification will be essential.

**3.3 Algorithmic Details: MLCL Formulation**
Let $f_\theta(\cdot)$ be the foundation model parameterized by $\theta$. We aim to optimize $\theta$ using a combined loss function:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{original} + \lambda_{tok} \mathcal{L}_{CL}^{tok} + \lambda_{stmt} \mathcal{L}_{CL}^{stmt} + \lambda_{src} \mathcal{L}_{CL}^{src}
$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{original}$ is the model's standard training objective (e.g., next-token prediction loss for LLMs), and $\lambda_{tok}, \lambda_{stmt}, \lambda_{src}$ are hyperparameters weighting the contribution of each contrastive loss term.

The contrastive losses will typically follow the InfoNCE (Information Noise Contrastive Estimation) structure (Oord et al., 2018):

$$
\mathcal{L}_{CL} = - \mathbb{E} \left[ \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(h_{query}, h_{pos}) / \tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(h_{query}, h_{pos}) / \tau) + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \exp(\text{sim}(h_{query}, h_{neg, i}) / \tau)} \right]
$$

where $h_{query}$ is the representation of the anchor sample, $h_{pos}$ is the representation of the positive sample, $h_{neg, i}$ are representations of $N$ negative samples, $\text{sim}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity), and $\tau$ is a temperature hyperparameter.

*   **Token-Level Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{CL}^{tok}$):**
    *   **Anchor ($h_{query}$):** Representation of the context $C$ just before predicting $t_k$ (e.g., hidden state of the last token $t_{k-1}$).
    *   **Positive ($h_{pos}$):** Representation derived from the target factual token $t_k^{fact}$ (e.g., hidden state after processing $t_k^{fact}$, or its embedding).
    *   **Negatives ($h_{neg, i}$):** Representations derived from hallucinated tokens $t_k^{hallu}$. These can be sampled from the model's own predicted distribution (filtered for incorrectness) or drawn from the curated dataset.

*   **Statement-Level Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{CL}^{stmt}$):**
    *   **Anchor ($h_{query}$):** Representation of the factual statement $S^{fact}$ (e.g., sentence embedding obtained by pooling token representations, perhaps from the `[CLS]` token or average pooling).
    *   **Positive ($h_{pos}$):** Could be another representation of the same factual statement $S^{fact}$ obtained through data augmentation (e.g., paraphrase) or simply using $S^{fact}$ itself depending on the setup (then $h_{query} = h_{pos}$). More typically, the anchor is the factual statement, and the positive might be a representation derived from its verified supporting evidence if available. A simpler approach contrasts factual vs. hallucinated directly.
    *   **Anchor/Positive setup 1:** $h_{query} = \text{rep}(S^{fact})$, $h_{pos} = \text{rep}(S^{fact, \text{augmented}})$, $h_{neg, i} = \text{rep}(S^{hallu}_i)$.
    *   **Anchor/Positive setup 2 (Simpler):** $h_{query} = \text{rep}(S^{fact})$, $h_{pos} = \text{rep}(S^{fact})$, $h_{neg, i} = \text{rep}(S^{hallu}_i)$. The pair $(S^{fact}, S^{hallu})$ forms the core contrast. We might need variations of the InfoNCE loss here, potentially focusing on maximizing distance between $S^{fact}$ and $S^{hallu}$ representations.

*   **Source-Reliability Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{CL}^{src}$):**
    *   **Anchor ($h_{query}$):** Representation of a statement $S$. This might potentially incorporate source metadata directly $h_{query} = \text{rep}(S, Src)$.
    *   **Positive ($h_{pos}$):** Representation of the same/similar statement $S$ associated with a high-reliability source $Src^{high}$. E.g., $h_{pos} = \text{rep}(S, Src^{high})$.
    *   **Negatives ($h_{neg, i}$):** Representations of $S$ associated with low-reliability sources $Src^{low}$ or representations of unrelated statements. E.g., $h_{neg, i} = \text{rep}(S, Src^{low}_i)$. This requires careful design of how source information influences the representation.

**3.4 Model Training/Fine-tuning**
We will implement the MLCL framework primarily during the fine-tuning stage of pre-trained foundation models (e.g., Llama-3, Mistral, or domain-specific models if available). Fine-tuning offers a practical way to adapt large models without the prohibitive cost of pre-training from scratch. The MLCL loss terms will be added to the standard fine-tuning objective (e.g., causal language modeling loss). We will explore different strategies for integrating the levels, such as joint optimization or staged training. Hyperparameter tuning ($\lambda$s, $\tau$, learning rate, batch size) will be performed using a validation set.

**3.5 Experimental Design**

*   **Base Models:** Select widely used FMs (e.g., Llama-3 8B/70B, Mistral 7B) to ensure reproducibility and relevance.
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **Standard Fine-tuning:** Base FM fine-tuned on the target domain data without MLCL.
    2.  **RAG Baseline:** Base FM integrated with a standard RAG system (e.g., using DPR/ColBERT for retrieval) without MLCL fine-tuning.
    3.  **Existing CL Methods:** If applicable and implementation permits, compare against methods like Iter-AHMCL (Wu et al., 2024) or Hallucination Augmented Contrastive Learning (Jiang et al., 2023), adapting them to our datasets/setup.
    4.  **Detection/Correction Baselines:** Compare against systems like RAG-HAT (Song et al., 2024) which use detection and correction post-generation.

*   **Datasets for Evaluation:**
    *   **General Hallucination:** TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022), HaluEval (Li et al., 2023).
    *   **Factuality in QA:** Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017).
    *   **Domain-Specific Evaluation:** Use or create datasets for targeted domains (e.g., MedQA for medical, BillSum for legal, finance news datasets). Evaluate factual accuracy and hallucination rates within these domains.
    *   **RAG-Specific Benchmarks:** Utilize benchmarks like RGB (Relevance-Grounded Benchmarks) or potentially Bi'an (Jiang et al., 2025) if applicable to RAG evaluation.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Hallucination Rate:**
        *   Automated metrics: Use LLM-based evaluation (e.g., GPT-4 as judge), specialized detectors (e.g., SelfCheckGPT, REFIND-style checks), NLI-based metrics comparing output against ground truth/retrieved documents (FActScore, DAE).
        *   Human Evaluation: Assess factuality, coherence, and hallucination presence on a sample of outputs. Essential for nuanced assessment.
    *   **Factual Accuracy:** Standard metrics for QA/Summarization tasks (Exact Match, F1 score, ROUGE, BLEU against factual references).
    *   **Generative Quality:** Perplexity on hold-out data, BLEU/ROUGE scores on general text generation tasks, human evaluation of fluency, coherence, and helpfulness.
    *   **Source Attribution:** (If source-level CL is effective) Evaluate the model's ability to cite sources correctly or indicate confidence based on source reliability.
    *   **Efficiency:** Measure training time overhead, increase in model parameters (if any), and inference latency compared to baselines.

*   **Ablation Studies:** Systematically evaluate the contribution of each contrastive learning level ($\mathcal{L}_{CL}^{tok}$, $\mathcal{L}_{CL}^{stmt}$, $\mathcal{L}_{CL}^{src}$) by training models with different combinations of these losses enabled. This will help understand the synergy and individual impact of each component. We will also analyze the sensitivity to key hyperparameters ($\lambda$s, $\tau$).

*   **Integration with RAG:** Evaluate two scenarios:
    1.  MLCL-fine-tuned model used directly for generation.
    2.  MLCL-fine-tuned model integrated within an RAG framework. Compare this against the RAG Baseline to see if MLCL pre-conditioning improves the RAG system's handling of retrieved information and reduces residual hallucinations.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact

**4.1 Expected Outcomes:**
*   **Quantifiable Reduction in Hallucinations:** We expect models trained with the MLCL framework to exhibit a statistically significant reduction in hallucination rates (e.g., measured by automated metrics on TruthfulQA/HaluEval and human evaluations) compared to baseline fine-tuned models, without substantial degradation in fluency or coherence.
*   **Improved Factual Consistency:** An increase in factual accuracy scores (EM, F1, RAG-based factuality scores) on relevant QA and summarization benchmarks.
*   **Enhanced Domain Adaptation:** MLCL fine-tuning on domain-specific data (e.g., medical) is expected to yield models that are more factually reliable within that domain compared to standard domain fine-tuning.
*   **Demonstrable Source Sensitivity (Potential):** If the source-reliability CL is successful, we anticipate the model might implicitly or explicitly show sensitivity to information provenance, potentially improving performance in RAG settings by better weighing evidence from reliable sources.
*   **Validated MLCL Framework:** A well-documented and empirically validated framework (code and potentially curated datasets) that can be adopted by other researchers and practitioners.
*   **Insights into Hallucination Mitigation:** Analysis from ablation studies will clarify the relative importance and interplay of token, statement, and source-level contrasts in combating hallucinations.
*   **Characterization of Trade-offs:** A clear understanding of the trade-offs between hallucination reduction, computational cost, and potential impacts on model expressiveness or performance on unrelated tasks.

**4.2 Impact:**
*   **Increased Reliability of FMs:** This research directly contributes to making FMs significantly more reliable and trustworthy, addressing a key bottleneck for their widespread adoption in real-world applications, especially critical domains. This aligns directly with the "Reliability and Responsibility" theme of the workshop.
*   **Safer AI Deployment:** By reducing the likelihood of FMs generating harmful misinformation, this work promotes safer and more ethical AI deployment, contributing to the "Safety, Ethics, and Fairness" goals.
*   **Enabling Practical Applications:** Improved reliability can unlock the use of FMs in areas where factual accuracy is non-negotiable (e.g., clinical decision support, financial reporting, educational tools), facilitating effective "Real-world Adaptation".
*   **Advancing FM Research:** Provides a novel approach to intrinsic factuality conditioning in FMs, potentially inspiring further research into representation learning for controllable generation and reasoning.
*   **Informing Best Practices:** Findings could inform best practices for training and fine-tuning FMs intended for high-reliability deployment scenarios, potentially influencing how developers mitigate risks associated with hallucinations.
*   **Addressing Practical Limitations:** While potentially adding some training overhead, by embedding reliability intrinsically, MLCL might offer a more efficient long-term solution than complex, multi-stage detection and correction pipelines, thus touching upon the "Practical Limitations" theme concerning computational costs at inference time.

In summary, this research promises to deliver both a practical framework for reducing FM hallucinations and valuable scientific insights, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust, reliable, and beneficial foundation models for society.
