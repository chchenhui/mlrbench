### Title: Bounded Rationality in Human Decision-Making: A Mechanistic Approach

### Motivation:
Current AI systems often assume human decision-making is rational and unbiased, which is a significant oversimplification. Understanding human decision-making's inherent bounded rationality can improve AI alignment and safety. This research aims to bridge the gap between AI and human cognition by developing mechanistic models that incorporate cognitive biases and limitations.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research will focus on developing a mechanistic interpretability framework for human decision-making, specifically addressing bounded rationality. This framework will employ techniques from cognitive science and behavioral economics to model cognitive biases such as anchoring, framing, and loss aversion. The methodology will involve:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from human decision-making experiments to capture cognitive biases and limitations.
2. **Model Development**: Creating a mechanistic model that simulates human decision-making under bounded rationality, incorporating cognitive biases.
3. **Evaluation**: Validating the model through comparison with human behavior in controlled experiments and real-world scenarios.
4. **Application**: Integrating the model into AI systems to improve alignment and safety by providing more accurate human feedback interpretations.

Expected outcomes include a more nuanced understanding of human decision-making and the development of AI systems that better align with human preferences and values. This research has the potential to significantly advance the field of Human-AI Alignment, making AI systems more ethical and user-centric.
