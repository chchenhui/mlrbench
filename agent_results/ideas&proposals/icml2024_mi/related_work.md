**Key Challenges:**

1. **Modeling Cognitive Effort**: Accurately quantifying the trade-off between human decision-making accuracy and mental effort remains complex, as existing models often overlook the variability in human cognitive processes.

2. **Data Collection Under Varying Conditions**: Gathering behavioral datasets that capture human feedback under diverse task complexities and constraints is challenging, yet essential for validating effort-aware models.

3. **Integrating Bounded Rationality Frameworks**: Incorporating concepts from cognitive science, such as bounded rationality, into machine learning models requires interdisciplinary expertise and careful methodological design.

4. **Addressing Systematic Biases**: Identifying and mitigating biases introduced by cognitive shortcuts in human feedback is critical to prevent misalignment in AI systems.

5. **Scalability and Generalization**: Developing models that generalize across different domains and scale effectively while accounting for cognitive effort poses significant technical challenges.
