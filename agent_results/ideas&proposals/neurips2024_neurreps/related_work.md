   - **Authors**: Jingyun Yang, Congyue Deng, Jimmy Wu, Rika Antonova, Leonidas Guibas, Jeannette Bohg
   - **Summary**: EquivAct introduces SIM(3)-equivariant network structures to guarantee generalization across object translations, 3D rotations, and scales. The method involves pre-training a SIM(3)-equivariant visual representation and learning a visuomotor policy, enabling zero-shot transfer to objects differing in scale, position, and orientation.

   - **Authors**: Tyler Ga Wei Lum, Martin Matak, Viktor Makoviychuk, Ankur Handa, Arthur Allshire, Tucker Hermans, Nathan D. Ratliff, Karl Van Wyk
   - **Summary**: DextrAH-G presents a depth-based dexterous grasping policy trained entirely in simulation, combining reinforcement learning, geometric fabrics, and teacher-student distillation. The approach addresses challenges in joint arm-hand policy learning, enabling a 23-motor arm-hand robot to safely and efficiently grasp and transport a variety of objects.

**Key Challenges**:

1. **Incorporating Non-Euclidean Data**: Effectively integrating non-Euclidean data, such as orientations and stiffness, into learning frameworks remains complex and requires advanced geometric understanding.

2. **Generalization Across Variations**: Ensuring that learned policies generalize across different object scales, positions, and orientations without extensive retraining is a significant hurdle.

3. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Bridging the gap between simulation-trained models and real-world applications poses challenges due to discrepancies between simulated and actual environments.

4. **High-Dimensional Control Spaces**: Managing the complexity of high-dimensional observation and action spaces in robotic systems complicates the learning process and policy optimization.

5. **Safety and Robustness**: Developing policies that ensure safe and robust operation of robots, especially in unstructured or dynamic environments, is critical yet challenging.
