**1. Title:** **Leveraging SE(3) Equivariance in World Models for Sample-Efficient Robotic Manipulation and Enhanced Generalization**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Robotic systems capable of operating autonomously and adapting robustly in complex, unstructured environments represent a grand challenge in artificial intelligence and robotics. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for acquiring sophisticated behaviors through interaction. However, standard RL methods, particularly when applied to high-dimensional problems like robotic manipulation from pixels, often suffer from prohibitive sample complexity, requiring millions or even billions of interactions to learn effective policies (Hafner et al., 2019; Schrittwieser et al., 2020). Furthermore, policies learned in simulation often struggle to generalize to novel scenarios or transfer effectively to the real world, especially when encountering geometric variations (e.g., different object poses, camera viewpoints) not extensively covered during training (Tobin et al., 2017).

Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) aims to mitigate sample complexity by learning a world model – a predictive model of the environment's dynamics and reward function. This model can then be used for planning or generating synthetic data, significantly reducing the need for real-world interactions (Moerland et al., 2023). However, conventional world models, often implemented using standard neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), typically do not explicitly account for the inherent geometric structure and symmetries present in the physical world. Tasks like object manipulation fundamentally involve transformations such as rotations and translations, governed by groups like the Special Euclidean group SE(3). Ignoring this structure forces the model to learn these symmetries implicitly from vast amounts of data, contributing to sample inefficiency and poor generalization to unseen geometric configurations.

Concurrently, the field of Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) has emerged, focusing on developing neural network architectures that incorporate geometric priors and symmetries (Bronstein et al., 2021). By designing networks that are *equivariant* to relevant transformation groups (e.g., rotation, translation), GDL models guarantee that the representations transform predictably under input transformations. This inductive bias leads to significant improvements in data efficiency, robustness, and generalization performance across various domains, including computer vision, molecular science, and physics (Cohen & Welling, 2016; Weiler et al., 2018; Fuchs et al., 2020). Applying these principles to world models for robotics holds immense potential.

Intriguingly, as highlighted by the NeurReps workshop theme, similar principles of geometric representation appear fundamental in biological neural systems. Evidence from head direction cells, grid cells, and motor cortex suggests that the brain leverages geometric structures to represent and process information efficiently (Kim et al., 2017; Gardner et al., 2022; Gallego et al., 2017). This convergence between neuroscience and GDL motivates the exploration of geometric priors, specifically equivariance, as a foundational principle for building more effective artificial intelligence systems, particularly in embodied domains like robotics. Recent works have started exploring geometric principles in RL and robotics (Alhousani et al., 2022; Yan et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023), demonstrating benefits in policy learning. Our work focuses specifically on incorporating these principles into the *world model* component of MBRL, which we hypothesize is critical for sample-efficient learning of dynamics critical for planning.

**2.2 Research Objectives**
This research proposes to develop and evaluate **Equivariant World Models (EWMs)** specifically designed for robotic manipulation tasks, leveraging SE(3) equivariance to improve sample efficiency and generalization. The primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop an SE(3)-Equivariant World Model Framework:** Design a neural network architecture for predicting environment dynamics ($s_{t+1}$) and rewards ($r_t$) given the current state ($s_t$) and action ($a_t$), such that the predictions transform predictably under SE(3) transformations applied to the state and action.
2.  **Implement EWM using Group-Equivariant Layers:** Instantiate the framework using appropriate SE(3)-equivariant neural network components (e.g., steerable CNNs for visual input, equivariant MLPs for integrating pose and proprioceptive information).
3.  **Integrate EWM with Model-Based Reinforcement Learning:** Employ the learned EWM within an MBRL framework for planning and policy optimization, enabling efficient learning of manipulation tasks.
4.  **Evaluate Sample Efficiency and Generalization:** Quantitatively compare the performance of the EWM-based MBRL agent against non-equivariant baselines in simulated robotic manipulation tasks, focusing on learning speed (sample efficiency) and robustness to geometric variations (generalization).
5.  **Investigate Sim-to-Real Transfer Potential:** Conduct preliminary assessments of the EWM's capability to facilitate sim-to-real transfer by testing generalization on geometrically transformed real-world scenarios or more realistic simulations.

**2.3 Significance**
This research lies at the intersection of geometric deep learning, model-based reinforcement learning, and robotics. Its significance stems from several factors:

1.  **Addressing Key Robotic Challenges:** It directly tackles the critical bottlenecks of sample inefficiency and limited generalization in robotic learning, which currently hinder the deployment of robots in complex, dynamic environments. The work aims to address challenges highlighted in recent geometric robotics literature (e.g., generalization across variations identified by Yang et al., 2023 and sim-to-real transfer).
2.  **Advancing Geometric Deep Learning:** It provides a concrete application of GDL principles to the challenging domain of world modeling for embodied agents operating in 3D space, pushing the boundaries of equivariant model design for sequential decision-making problems.
3.  **Bridging GDL and Embodied AI:** This research aims to demonstrate that incorporating fundamental geometric priors, inspired by both mathematical principles and observations in neuroscience, can lead to more efficient and robust embodied intelligence. It directly aligns with the NeurReps workshop's goals of exploring symmetry and geometry in neural representations, particularly the themes of "Theory and methods for learning invariant and equivariant representations," "Learning and leveraging group structure in data," and "Equivariant world models."
4.  **Potential for Real-World Impact:** By enabling robots to learn complex manipulation skills with less data and generalize better to novel situations, this research could accelerate progress in areas like logistics, manufacturing, assistive robotics, and domestic service robots.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework**
We propose an MBRL framework centered around an SE(3)-Equivariant World Model (EWM). The EWM, denoted by $M_{\theta}$ with parameters $\theta$, takes the current state $s_t$ and action $a_t$ as input and predicts the next state $\hat{s}_{t+1}$ and the expected reward $\hat{r}_t$:
$$(\hat{s}_{t+1}, \hat{r}_t) = M_{\theta}(s_t, a_t)$$
The core characteristic of the EWM is its SE(3) equivariance. Let $G = SE(3)$ be the group of 3D rigid body motions (rotations and translations). Let $T_g$ denote the action of a group element $g \in G$ on the state space $\mathcal{S}$, and $U_g$ denote its action on the action space $\mathcal{A}$. The EWM $M_{\theta}$ is designed to be equivariant if the following condition holds for all $g \in G$, $s_t \in \mathcal{S}$, $a_t \in \mathcal{A}$:
$$M_{\theta}(T_g s_t, U_g a_t) = (T_g \hat{s}_{t+1}, \hat{r}_t)$$
Here, we assume the reward $r_t$ is invariant under the group action ($V_g \hat{r}_t = \hat{r}_t$), which is common in goal-reaching tasks where the goal configuration might transform with the environment but the scalar reward value structure remains the same relative to the transformed goal. The state prediction $\hat{s}_{t+1}$ transforms covariantly with the group action $T_g$.

**3.2 Data Collection and Representation**
*   **Simulation Environment:** We will utilize realistic physics simulators like Isaac Gym or PyBullet, which provide efficient parallel simulation capabilities and support for common robotic platforms (e.g., Franka Emika Panda arm).
*   **Robotic Tasks:** We will focus on 6-DOF robotic manipulation tasks involving SE(3) symmetry, such as:
    *   **Object Pushing/Sliding:** Pushing an object from a random initial pose to a target pose.
    *   **Block Stacking:** Stacking blocks where initial and target configurations can be rotated and translated.
    *   **Peg-in-Hole Insertion:** Inserting a peg into a hole with varying relative poses.
*   **State Representation ($s_t$):** The state will encapsulate the robot's configuration and the relevant aspects of the environment. This may include:
    *   Robot proprioception (joint angles, velocities).
    *   Object poses (position and orientation, represented e.g., as $(p, q) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \times SO(3)$).
    *   Visual observations (e.g., point clouds from depth cameras, potentially voxelized or processed into geometric features). $T_g$ will act appropriately on each component (e.g., rotate/translate points/poses, identity on joint angles if base frame is fixed relative to the world transformation).
*   **Action Representation ($a_t$):** Actions will typically be low-dimensional control commands, such as target end-effector delta-poses (position and orientation changes) or joint velocity commands. $U_g$ will transform action components specified in a world or object frame (e.g., delta-translation vectors rotate with $g$). Actions specified purely in the robot's internal joint space might be invariant under $U_g$. The exact definition of $U_g$ depends on the chosen action space and task frame.
*   **Data Generation:** Data tuples $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$ will be collected by executing policies (initially random, later optimized) within the simulation environment and storing the transitions in a replay buffer $\mathcal{D}$.

**3.3 Equivariant Network Architecture ($M_{\theta}$)**
The EWM $M_{\theta}$ will be constructed using SE(3)-equivariant neural network layers. The specific architecture will depend on the state representation:

*   **Processing Geometric State (Poses, Point Clouds):** If the state includes object poses or point clouds, we will employ SE(3)-equivariant networks like Tensor Field Networks (Thomas et al., 2018), SE(3)-Transformers (Fuchs et al., 2020), or Steerable CNNs defined on $\mathbb{R}^3$ (Weiler et al., 2018; Geiger et al., 2022, using libraries like `e3nn`). These layers process geometric data while respecting SE(3) symmetries. Input features (e.g., point coordinates, associated features) will be represented as SE(3) steerable feature fields.
*   **Processing Visual Input (Images/Voxels):** If using voxelized visual input, 3D Steerable CNNs can ensure SE(3) equivariance. For 2D images, if the primary symmetry is SE(2) (e.g., top-down view), SE(2)-equivariant CNNs (Cohen & Welling, 2016; Weiler & Cesa, 2019, using libraries like `e2cnn`) can be used. Projecting 3D equivariance onto 2D views is complex; using 3D representations like point clouds or voxels simplifies enforcing SE(3) structure.
*   **Fusing Modalities and Prediction:** Equivariant Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) will fuse features from different modalities (geometric, proprioceptive) and predict the change in state ($\Delta s = s_{t+1} - s_t$ or using geodesic distances for rotations) and the reward $r_t$. Action $a_t$ will be incorporated as conditional input, potentially represented as steerable features if it transforms non-trivially under $U_g$.

The network will be designed such that the output state representation $\hat{s}_{t+1}$ transforms according to $T_g$ when the input state $s_t$ is transformed by $T_g$ and action $a_t$ by $U_g$. This is achieved by ensuring all intermediate feature representations within the network are SE(3) steerable features (vectors, tensors, etc., that transform according to specific irreducible representations of SE(3)).

**3.4 World Model Training**
The EWM parameters $\theta$ are learned by minimizing a supervised loss function on transitions sampled from the replay buffer $\mathcal{D}$:
$$L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1}) \sim \mathcal{D}} [L_{state}(s_{t+1}, \hat{s}_{t+1}) + \lambda L_{reward}(r_t, \hat{r}_t)]$$
where $(\hat{s}_{t+1}, \hat{r}_t) = M_{\theta}(s_t, a_t)$.
*   **State Loss ($L_{state}$):** For Euclidean components of the state (e.g., positions, joint angles), Mean Squared Error (MSE) is suitable. For orientations (e.g., SO(3) components), a geodesic distance or quaternion distance metric is more appropriate:
    $$L_{SO(3)}(q, \hat{q}) = \min(||q - \hat{q}||_2^2, ||q + \hat{q}||_2^2)$$ or $$L_{SO(3)}(R, \hat{R}) = ||\log(\hat{R}^T R)||_F^2$$
*   **Reward Loss ($L_{reward}$):** Typically MSE for continuous rewards or Cross-Entropy loss for discrete/categorical reward structures.
*   **Optimization:** Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or variants (Adam) will be used to minimize $L(\theta)$. The inherent equivariance of the architecture serves as a strong inductive bias, potentially reducing the need for explicit data augmentation related to SE(3) transformations, although symmetry-aware augmentation could be explored as a complementary technique.

**3.5 Integration with Model-Based RL and Planning**
Once the EWM $M_{\theta}$ is trained (either offline from an initial dataset or continuously online), it will be used for planning to select actions that maximize expected future rewards. We will employ a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach, specifically leveraging sampling-based trajectory optimization methods like the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) or Model Predictive Path Integral control (MPPI).

The planning process at each time step $t$:
1.  Observe the current state $s_t$.
2.  Generate $N$ candidate action sequences $A_k = (a_{t:t+H-1})_k$ for a planning horizon $H$.
3.  Use the learned EWM $M_{\theta}$ to predict the sequence of future states and rewards $(\hat{s}_{t+1:t+H}, \hat{r}_{t:t+H-1})_k$ resulting from each action sequence $A_k$, starting from $s_t$.
    $$\hat{s}_{\tau+1}, \hat{r}_{\tau} = M_{\theta}(\hat{s}_{\tau}, a_{\tau})$$ for $\tau = t, ..., t+H-1$.
4.  Evaluate each sequence by summing the predicted rewards: $J_k = \sum_{\tau=t}^{t+H-1} \gamma^{\tau-t} \hat{r}_{\tau}$.
5.  Select the optimal action sequence $A^*$ based on the predicted returns (e.g., using CEM's iterative refinement of the action distribution).
6.  Execute the first action $a^*_t$ from the optimal sequence $A^*$.
7.  Observe the actual next state $s_{t+1}$ and reward $r_t$, add the transition $(s_t, a^*_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$ to the replay buffer $\mathcal{D}$.
8.  Optionally, update the EWM parameters $\theta$ using data from $\mathcal{D}$.
9.  Repeat from step 1 for the next time step $t+1$.

This constitutes an online MBRL loop where the agent continually collects data, refines its world model, and uses it for planning.

**3.6 Experimental Design and Validation**
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **Non-Equivariant World Model (Std-WM):** An equivalent capacity world model using standard CNNs (if visual input) and MLPs, without explicit equivariance constraints. Trained with the same MBRL framework.
    2.  **Std-WM + Data Augmentation (Std-WM+Aug):** The non-equivariant WM trained with extensive SE(3) data augmentation applied to the training transitions. This isolates the benefit of *built-in* equivariance versus learning from augmented data.
    3.  **Model-Free RL:** A state-of-the-art model-free algorithm (e.g., SAC, PPO) applied directly to the task, serving as a reference for sample complexity.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Sample Efficiency:** Plot learning curves (task success rate or cumulative reward vs. number of environment interactions/steps). We expect EWM-MBRL to learn significantly faster.
    2.  **Generalization:** Train all models on a canonical set of task configurations. Evaluate performance on a test set containing SE(3) transformations (rotations, translations) of the training configurations that were *not* seen during training. Measure success rate and reward on this test set. We expect EWM-MBRL to generalize much better.
    3.  **Planning Performance:** Analyze the prediction accuracy of the learned world models ($L_{state}$ and $L_{reward}$ on a hold-out set).
    4.  **Computational Cost:** Measure training time and planning time per step. Equivariant layers can sometimes be computationally more expensive, which needs assessment.
*   **Sim-to-Real Validation (Preliminary):** Assess zero-shot or few-shot transfer performance. Train policies in simulation using the EWM-MBRL framework. Test the learned policy on a real robot (if available) or a more photo-realistic simulator with domain randomization, focusing on scenarios involving geometric variations of the training setup. Measure task success rate with minimal or no fine-tuning. This addresses the sim-to-real challenge noted in the literature (Lum et al., 2024).

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**
We anticipate the following outcomes from this research:

1.  **Demonstration of Enhanced Sample Efficiency:** The EWM-MBRL agent is expected to achieve higher performance (success rate, reward) significantly faster (using fewer environment samples) compared to both the Std-WM baseline and the model-free baseline on the selected robotic manipulation tasks.
2.  **Superior Generalization to Geometric Variations:** The EWM-MBRL agent will exhibit substantially better zero-shot generalization performance on test scenarios involving unseen SE(3) transformations (e.g., rotated objects, shifted goal locations) compared to the Std-WM and Std-WM+Aug baselines. This will validate the benefit of built-in equivariance.
3.  **Quantifiable Benefits of Equivariance:** The comparative analysis against baselines will provide quantitative evidence on the degree to which SE(3) equivariance improves world model learning and downstream control performance in robotics.
4.  **A Flexible EWM Framework:** Development of a modular EWM architecture applicable to various robotic manipulation tasks involving SE(3) symmetries, along with insights into designing appropriate equivariant representations for state and action spaces.
5.  **Insights into Sim-to-Real Transfer:** Preliminary results indicating whether the enhanced geometric generalization provided by EWMs translates into improved robustness during sim-to-real transfer.

**4.2 Impact**
The successful completion of this research will have several significant impacts:

1.  **Practical Robotics:** It will contribute a practical method for significantly reducing the data requirements and improving the robustness of robotic learning systems. This could enable robots to learn complex manipulation skills more rapidly and operate reliably in less structured human environments (homes, warehouses, hospitals), addressing a key barrier to widespread adoption.
2.  **Geometric Deep Learning & RL:** It will provide a compelling demonstration of GDL principles successfully applied to world modeling in MBRL for complex, high-dimensional robotic control. This strengthens the case for incorporating geometric priors into learning systems for embodied AI and potentially inspire further research into equivariant models for dynamics prediction, planning, and control.
3.  **Contribution to NeurReps Themes:** This work directly contributes to the NeurReps workshop's core themes by exploring equivariant representations, leveraging group structure (SE(3)) in data, building equivariant world models, and investigating the dynamics of these structured representations within an RL context. It showcases the power of symmetry principles, bridging theoretical GDL concepts with practical applications in intelligent systems.
4.  **Theoretical Understanding:** The project may offer insights into the fundamental principles of how intelligent agents, both biological and artificial, can build efficient and generalizable internal models of the world by exploiting its inherent geometric structure, echoing the convergent findings in neuroscience and machine learning highlighted by the workshop.

By demonstrating the power of SE(3) equivariance in world models, this research aims to pave the way for more data-efficient, robust, and adaptable robotic systems capable of navigating and interacting with the geometric complexities of the real world.
