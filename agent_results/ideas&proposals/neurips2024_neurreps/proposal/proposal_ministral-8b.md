# Equivariant World Models for Sample-Efficient Robotic Learning

## Introduction

### Background

The convergence of geometric deep learning (GDL) and neuroscience reveals a profound computational strategy that preserves the geometric and topological structure of data throughout processing stages. This strategy has been observed in various neural circuits, such as those representing head direction in the fly, grid cells, and motor cortex, suggesting a substrate-agnostic principle for forming useful representations. Independently, GDL has emerged in the field of deep learning, incorporating geometric priors into neural networks to enhance computational efficiency, robustness, and generalization performance. This convergence underscores the potential for symmetry and geometry to unify models across disciplines, from neuroscience to artificial intelligence.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a framework for building equivariant world models that explicitly respect environmental symmetries, such as rotational and translational symmetries, to improve sample efficiency and generalization in robotic learning. Specifically, we aim to:

1. **Design Group-Equivariant Neural Networks**: Develop neural network architectures that preserve equivariance to transformations, such as rotations and translations, ensuring that the model's predictions remain invariant under these transformations.
2. **Integrate Symmetry-Aware Data Augmentation**: Enhance the training process by incorporating symmetry-aware data augmentation techniques to improve the model's robustness and generalization to symmetric variations.
3. **Validate in Simulation and Real-World Settings**: Train and validate the proposed equivariant world models using reinforcement learning in simulation and evaluate their performance on real robots performing tasks like object manipulation and navigation.
4. **Benchmark Against Non-Equivariant Baselines**: Compare the performance of the equivariant world models against traditional non-equivariant baselines to quantify gains in sample efficiency and robustness.

### Significance

The successful implementation of equivariant world models could lead to significant advancements in robotic systems' adaptability and efficiency. By leveraging geometric priors, these models would enable robots to rapidly adapt to geometric variations in unstructured environments, such as homes or warehouses. This research aligns with the broader goals of the NeurReps Workshop, which seeks to bridge geometric deep learning with embodied AI and understanding the role of symmetry in neural representations.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed research involves the following key steps:

1. **Network Architecture Design**: Develop group-equivariant neural network architectures, such as equivariant convolutional layers or steerable kernels, to enforce symmetry constraints in visual inputs and physical dynamics.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Implement symmetry-aware data augmentation techniques to generate training data that respects the environmental symmetries.
3. **Reinforcement Learning Training**: Train the equivariant world models using reinforcement learning in simulation, leveraging the symmetry-aware data augmentation.
4. **Real-World Validation**: Validate the trained models on real robots performing tasks like object manipulation or navigation.
5. **Benchmarking and Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the equivariant world models against non-equivariant baselines using appropriate evaluation metrics.

### Algorithmic Steps

#### Step 1: Network Architecture Design

We propose using group-equivariant neural networks to ensure that the model's predictions are invariant under transformations. For instance, we can use equivariant convolutional layers that preserve rotational and translational symmetries. The architecture can be represented as follows:

\[
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{W} \cdot \mathbf{x}
\]

where \(\mathbf{W}\) is the equivariant weight matrix, and \(\mathbf{x}\) is the input feature map. The equivariant weight matrix can be constructed using group theory principles, ensuring that the transformations are preserved.

#### Step 2: Symmetry-Aware Data Augmentation

To enhance the training process, we incorporate symmetry-aware data augmentation techniques. This can be achieved by applying random transformations, such as rotations and translations, to the training data. The augmented data can be represented as:

\[
\mathbf{x}' = \mathbf{R} \cdot \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{t}
\]

where \(\mathbf{R}\) is a rotation matrix, \(\mathbf{t}\) is a translation vector, and \(\mathbf{x}'\) is the augmented input.

#### Step 3: Reinforcement Learning Training

We train the equivariant world models using reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation. The RL algorithm can be represented as:

\[
\pi \leftarrow \arg\max_\pi \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) \right]
\]

where \(\pi\) is the policy, \(\gamma\) is the discount factor, \(R\) is the reward function, and \(s_t\) and \(a_t\) are the state and action at time \(t\).

#### Step 4: Real-World Validation

We validate the trained models on real robots performing tasks like object manipulation or navigation. The performance can be evaluated using metrics such as success rate, time to completion, and robustness to variations in the environment.

#### Step 5: Benchmarking and Evaluation

We compare the performance of the equivariant world models against non-equivariant baselines using metrics such as sample efficiency, generalization performance, and robustness to variations.

### Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the proposed equivariant world models, we use the following metrics:

1. **Sample Efficiency**: Measure the amount of training data required to achieve a certain level of performance.
2. **Generalization Performance**: Evaluate the model's ability to generalize to unseen variations in the environment.
3. **Robustness**: Assess the model's robustness to variations in the environment, such as rotations or translations.
4. **Success Rate**: Measure the proportion of successful task completions.
5. **Time to Completion**: Evaluate the time taken to complete the task.
