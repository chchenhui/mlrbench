**Equivariant World Models: Bridging Geometric Deep Learning and Robotic Sample Efficiency**

## 2. Introduction  

### Background  
The brain’s ability to encode geometric and topological structures in sensory and motor tasks—evident in grid cell activity, head direction circuits, and motor cortex dynamics—reveals a fundamental principle of neural computation: *symmetry preservation*. Similarly, geometric deep learning (GDL) leverages symmetry priors (e.g., translation, rotation) to build neural networks that generalize robustly across transformations. Recent advances in robotics, such as geometric reinforcement learning (G-RL) and equivariant control policies, demonstrate promising results by embedding geometric constraints. However, state-of-the-art world models—critical for planning and control in robots—often ignore these structural symmetries, leading to high sample complexity and poor generalization in tasks like manipulation and navigation.  

### Research Objectives  
This work aims to design **equivariant world models** that preserve the symmetry structure of robotic environments, thereby improving sample efficiency and generalization. Key objectives include:  
1. Developing group-equivariant neural network architectures for modeling environment dynamics and rewards under symmetries like SE(2) or SE(3).  
2. Integrating symmetry-aware data augmentation and loss functions to enforce equivariance during training.  
3. Validating the framework on simulated and real robotic tasks, quantifying gains in sample efficiency and robustness.  

### Significance  
By aligning world models with the intrinsic geometry of robotic tasks, this work bridges three critical gaps:  
- **Neuroscience-GDL Intersection**: Testing whether symmetry preservation—a neural coding strategy—enhances artificial systems.  
- **Robotic Learning**: Addressing high sample complexity, a key bottleneck in real-world robotic deployment.  
- **Generalization**: Enabling robots to adapt to unseen spatial configurations (e.g., rotated objects, shifted goals) without retraining.

## 3. Methodology  

### 3.1 Data Collection and Symmetry Augmentation  
**Simulation Environments**: Tasks include (1) **object manipulation** (grasping, pushing) with SE(3)-equivariant object poses and (2) **navigation** in 2D/3D grid worlds with SE(2)/SE(3) symmetries. Data will be generated using PyBullet and Isaac Sim.  

**Symmetry Augmentation**: For each transition tuple $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$, apply group transformations $g \in G$ (e.g., rotations, translations) to generate augmented data:  
$$(g \cdot s_t, g \cdot a_t, r_t, g \cdot s_{t+1}),$$  
where $G$ is the symmetry group (e.g., SO(3) for 3D rotations).  

**Real-World Data**: Depth-based sensors (as in DextrAH-G) will capture object poses and workspace geometry for sim-to-real transfer.  

### 3.2 Equivariant World Model Architecture  
The world model comprises two modules: a **dynamics model** $f_\theta$ and a **reward predictor** $h_\phi$, both equivariant to $G$.  

#### Dynamics Model  
Using steerable CNNs or group-equivariant layers, $f_\theta$ predicts the next state $s_{t+1}$ from $(s_t, a_t)$. For a group $G$ with representation $\rho$, layer $l$ is defined as:  
$$
f^{(l)}(x) = \sigma\left( \sum_{k} w_k *_{\rho} x \right),
$$  
where $*_{\rho}$ is the group-equivariant convolution and $\sigma$ an equivariant nonlinearity.  

#### Reward Predictor  
$h_\phi$ is an invariant function under $G$, yielding rewards $r_t$ invariant to transformations (e.g., goal distance is SE(3)-invariant).  

#### Loss Function  
The model minimizes:  
$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})} \left[ \|f_\theta(s_t, a_t) - s_{t+1}\|^2 + \alpha \cdot (h_\phi(s_t, a_t) - r_t)^2 \right],
$$  
where $\alpha$ weights the reward prediction loss.  

### 3.3 Reinforcement Learning Framework  
We train a policy $\pi_\psi$ using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with the equivariant world model as a simulator:  
1. **Model-Based Rollouts**: After training $f_\theta$ and $h_\phi$, generate synthetic transitions $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$ for policy updates.  
2. **Equivariant Policy**: $\pi_\psi$ uses equivariant layers to map states $s_t$ to actions $a_t$, constrained by group symmetries (e.g., rotational equivariance for gripper orientation).  

### 3.4 Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics  
**Tasks**:  
- **Simulation**: Object manipulation (MetaWorld), navigation (Habitat), and continuous control (RoboSuite).  
- **Real-World**: Dexterous grasping with a 23-DoF robotic arm (DextrAH-G setup).  

**Baselines**:  
1. Non-equivariant world models (e.g., Dreamer).  
2. Geometric RL (G-RL) without world models.  
3. Data-augmented variants (e.g., RAD).  

**Metrics**:  
1. **Sample Efficiency**: Episodes/steps to reach 80% success rate.  
2. **Generalization Accuracy**: Success rate on transformed environments (e.g., rotated objects).  
3. **Robustness**: Performance under sensor noise and dynamics perturbations.  

**Statistical Analysis**: Compare mean performance across 10 seeds using ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Expected Outcomes  
1. **Sample Efficiency**: Equivariant world models will reduce training samples by 30–50% compared to non-equivariant baselines.  
2. **Generalization**: Policies will achieve ≥80% success rates on transformed tasks without fine-tuning.  
3. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Depth-based equivariant models will show ≤15% performance drop in real-world trials.  

### Impact  
This work will advance robotic learning in three ways:  
1. **Theoretical**: Formalize the role of symmetry preservation in world models, aligning with neuroscience principles.  
2. **Methodological**: Introduce scalable equivariant architectures for high-dimensional control tasks.  
3. **Practical**: Enable rapid deployment of robots in homes, warehouses, and hospitals, where geometric variations are ubiquitous.  

By uniting geometric deep learning with robotic embodiment, this research directly addresses the NeurReps Workshop’s goal of exploring symmetry-aware neural representations across biological and artificial systems.
