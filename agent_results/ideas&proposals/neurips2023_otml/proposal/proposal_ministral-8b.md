Adaptive Unbalanced Optimal Transport for Robust Domain Adaptation under Label Shift

## 2. Introduction

### Background

Optimal Transport (OT) has emerged as a powerful tool in machine learning, particularly in domain adaptation tasks. Standard OT methods assume balanced class distributions between source and target domains, which is often not the case in real-world scenarios. Label shifts or varying class proportions can degrade the performance of these methods, necessitating the development of more robust techniques. Unbalanced OT (UOT) partially addresses this by allowing mass variation, but typically requires predefined marginal relaxation parameters. This research aims to develop an Adaptive Unbalanced Optimal Transport (A-UOT) framework integrated within a deep domain adaptation model. Instead of fixed relaxation parameters, A-UOT learns the optimal degree of mass variation between source and target feature distributions directly from the data during training. This is achieved by optimizing the UOT cost jointly with learnable parameters controlling marginal constraints, potentially guided by target domain statistics or pseudo-label estimates. This allows the model to implicitly estimate and compensate for label shifts.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. **Development of an Adaptive Unbalanced Optimal Transport (A-UOT) Framework**: Create a novel method that learns the optimal degree of mass variation between source and target feature distributions.
2. **Integration with Deep Domain Adaptation Models**: Incorporate the A-UOT framework into existing deep learning models to enhance their robustness to label shifts.
3. **Evaluation of Performance**: Assess the performance of the A-UOT framework on benchmarks with significant class imbalance or label shifts compared to standard OT and fixed UOT methods.
4. **Impact on Practical Applications**: Demonstrate the practical applicability and robustness of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.

### Significance

The proposed A-UOT framework addresses the limitations of existing OT-based domain adaptation methods, particularly their sensitivity to label shifts and the need for predefined marginal relaxation parameters. By learning the optimal degree of mass variation directly from the data, the method can adapt to unknown label shifts, thereby improving the robustness and performance of domain adaptation tasks. This research has the potential to significantly impact various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and computational biology, where domain adaptation is crucial.

## 3. Methodology

### Research Design

The research design involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preparation**: Collect and preprocess datasets with significant class imbalance or label shifts.
2. **Model Architecture**: Develop a deep domain adaptation model incorporating the A-UOT framework.
3. **Training Procedure**: Optimize the UOT cost jointly with learnable parameters controlling marginal constraints.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the model on various benchmarks and real-world datasets.
5. **Analysis**: Analyze the results to understand the effectiveness and robustness of the A-UOT framework.

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

We will use publicly available datasets that exhibit significant class imbalance or label shifts. These datasets will be preprocessed to ensure consistency and remove any noise that could affect the results. The preprocessing steps may include normalization, feature scaling, and data augmentation techniques to enhance the robustness of the model.

### Model Architecture

The proposed model architecture consists of two main components:
1. **Feature Extractor**: A deep neural network that extracts feature representations from the input data.
2. **Adaptive Unbalanced Optimal Transport (A-UOT) Module**: A module that learns the optimal degree of mass variation between source and target feature distributions.

The A-UOT module will take the feature representations from the source and target domains as inputs and optimize the UOT cost function. The UOT cost function will be defined as:

\[ \mathcal{L}_{\text{UOT}} = \sum_{i,j} \left| f_i(x_i) - f_j(y_j) \right| \cdot \left| \frac{\pi_{ij}}{\sum_{k,l} \pi_{kl}} - \frac{\mu_i}{\sum_{k} \mu_k} \right| \]

where \( f_i(x_i) \) and \( f_j(y_j) \) are the feature representations of the source and target samples, respectively, \( \pi_{ij} \) is the transport plan, and \( \mu_i \) is the marginal distribution of the source domain.

### Training Procedure

The training procedure will involve the following steps:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize the learnable parameters of the A-UOT module.
2. **Forward Pass**: Pass the source and target feature representations through the A-UOT module to compute the UOT cost.
3. **Backward Pass**: Compute the gradients of the UOT cost with respect to the learnable parameters and update them using an optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam).
4. **Iteration**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence.

### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the A-UOT framework will be evaluated using the following metrics:
1. **Accuracy**: Measure the accuracy of the model on the target domain.
2. **F1 Score**: Measure the F1 score of the model on the target domain.
3. **Wasserstein Distance**: Measure the Wasserstein distance between the source and target feature distributions.
4. **Label Shift Compensation**: Measure the degree to which the model compensates for label shifts.

### Experimental Design

The experimental design will involve the following steps:
1. **Dataset Selection**: Select a set of benchmark datasets with significant class imbalance or label shifts.
2. **Model Training**: Train the A-UOT framework on the selected datasets using the proposed training procedure.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model on the selected datasets using the proposed evaluation metrics.
4. **Comparison**: Compare the performance of the A-UOT framework with standard OT and fixed UOT methods.
