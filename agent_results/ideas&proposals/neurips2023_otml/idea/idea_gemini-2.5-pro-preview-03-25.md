**Title:** Adaptive Unbalanced Optimal Transport for Robust Domain Adaptation under Label Shift

**Motivation:** Standard Optimal Transport (OT) methods for domain adaptation often assume balanced class distributions between source and target domains. However, real-world scenarios frequently exhibit label shifts or varying class proportions, violating this assumption and degrading performance. Unbalanced OT (UOT) partially addresses this by allowing mass variation, but typically requires predefined marginal relaxation parameters. This research aims to develop a more robust domain adaptation technique that automatically adapts to unknown label shifts.

**Main Idea:** We propose an Adaptive Unbalanced Optimal Transport (A-UOT) framework integrated within a deep domain adaptation model. Instead of fixed relaxation parameters, A-UOT learns the optimal degree of mass variation between source and target feature distributions directly from the data during training. This is achieved by optimizing the UOT cost jointly with learnable parameters controlling marginal constraints, potentially guided by target domain statistics or pseudo-label estimates. This allows the model to implicitly estimate and compensate for label shifts. Expected outcomes include improved adaptation performance on benchmarks with significant class imbalance or label shifts compared to standard OT and fixed UOT methods, enhancing robustness in practical applications.
