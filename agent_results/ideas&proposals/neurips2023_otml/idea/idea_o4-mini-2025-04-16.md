Title: Unbalanced Multi-Marginal Optimal Transport for Single-Cell Multi-Omics Integration

Motivation:  
Integrating heterogeneous single-cell modalities (e.g., transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, surface proteins) is crucial for comprehensive cellular characterization. Existing alignment methods struggle with missing modalities, varying cell counts, and nonmatching mass across datasets. An unbalanced multi-marginal OT approach can flexibly reconcile these differences and recover biologically meaningful correspondences.

Main Idea:  
We propose an unbalanced multi-marginal optimal transport framework that simultaneously aligns k single-cell modalities with relaxed mass constraints. Each modality is treated as a marginal, and we introduce entropic and Kullback–Leibler regularizations to promote smooth couplings while allowing for unmatched or spurious cells. A composite cost function encodes modality-specific dissimilarities (e.g., gene expression distances, chromatin peak divergences) and cross-modality affinities (e.g., shared cell‐type labels). We develop a scalable Sinkhorn-type solver with stochastic mini-batch updates and low‐rank approximations of the multi-way coupling, yielding near‐linear complexity in cell number. Empirical results on public scRNA+scATAC+ADT datasets demonstrate improved joint clustering, imputation of missing modalities, and recovery of developmental trajectories. This method provides a practical, theoretically grounded tool for robust single-cell data fusion.
