Title: Cycle-Consistent Instruction Alignment for Robust LLMs

Motivation:  
Instruction-tuned LLMs often misinterpret or hallucinate when faced with ambiguous or adversarial prompts, undermining reliability and safety. Enforcing a two-way “understand-then-reproduce” check can tighten alignment between user intent and model behavior, reduce hallucinations, and improve interpretability.

Main Idea:  
We propose co-training an Instruction-to-Output (I2O) module alongside an Output-to-Instruction (O2I) module that attempts to recover the original prompt from the generated response. The joint training objective combines:  
1. Standard instruction following loss (e.g., cross-entropy or RLHF reward) on I2O.  
2. Cycle-consistency loss between original instructions and O2I reconstructions.  
3. Adversarial-prompt robustness by injecting paraphrases or malicious perturbations into instructions and enforcing consistent cycle reconstructions.  

Methodology:  
• Initialize I2O with pre-trained instruction-tuned weights; randomly initialize O2I.  
• Alternate gradient steps: update I2O on instruction-following tasks; update both modules on cycle loss.  
• Evaluate robustness on adversarial bench­marks and measure reduction in hallucinations.  

Expected Outcomes & Impact:  
This dual-module approach yields LLMs that better preserve user intent, detect misalignment via reconstruction errors, and resist prompt-based attacks—advancing both safety and trustworthiness in instruction following.
