# Dynamic Context Windows for Effective Long-Text Instruction Following

## Motivation
While current instruction-tuned LLMs can handle increasingly longer contexts, they often struggle with efficiently managing attention over very long texts, leading to degraded performance in tasks requiring comprehensive understanding of extensive documents. This limitation hinders applications in fields like legal document analysis, literature review, and comprehensive research tasks where maintaining context over long spans is crucial.

## Main Idea
I propose a novel approach called "Dynamic Context Windows" (DCW) that adaptively adjusts attention mechanisms based on instruction-specific requirements. Rather than processing the entire context with uniform attention, DCW strategically segments long texts into hierarchical importance zones based on instruction semantics. The system employs a two-phase architecture: first, a lightweight classifier identifies critical segments based on relevance to the instruction; second, these segments receive enhanced computational resources during processing while maintaining connections to less relevant portions through sparse attention patterns. This approach would significantly reduce computational costs while improving performance on long-text tasks. DCW could be implemented through fine-tuning existing models with specialized datasets containing varying-length documents paired with instructions requiring different attention patterns. Evaluation would focus on both effectiveness (accuracy on information retrieval, summarization, and analysis tasks) and efficiency (computational resources used relative to full-context processing).
