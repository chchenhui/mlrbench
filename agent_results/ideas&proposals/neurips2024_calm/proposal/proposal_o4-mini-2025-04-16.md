Title  
Counterfactually Guided Fine-tuning for Robust Large Language Models  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by achieving near-human performance on a variety of tasks, often trained with simple self-supervised objectives over massive unstructured corpora. Despite their success, these “black-box” models frequently rely on spurious correlations—statistical shortcuts present in the training data—that fail under distribution shifts or in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, hiring, and law. Causal inference offers a principled framework for reasoning about interventions and counterfactuals, yet integrating causal tools into large-scale LLM training remains an open challenge.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a fine-tuning methodology that explicitly steers LLMs away from spurious correlations and toward true causal relationships. Our key objectives are:  
• Identify and formalize potential spurious correlates in text classification tasks.  
• Construct a minimal structural causal model (SCM) that captures the desired causal dependency and the unwanted spurious path.  
• Automatically generate counterfactual text pairs via interventions on the SCM.  
• Define and optimize a counterfactual consistency loss that encourages the model to base its predictions on the true cause.  
• Empirically validate improved out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and fairness across multiple benchmarks.  

Significance  
By instilling causal inductive biases into large-scale fine-tuning, this research will:  
• Enhance model robustness under real-world distribution shifts.  
• Improve fairness by reducing sensitivity to protected attributes.  
• Offer insights into the causal structures captured (or ignored) by LLMs.  
• Bridge the gap between theoretical causal inference and practical large-model training.  

2. Literature Review  
We build on recent work across four key strands:  

1. Assessing causal reasoning in LLMs  
   – “Can Large Language Models Infer Causation from Correlation?” (Jin et al., 2023) introduces the Corr2Cause benchmark and finds LLMs perform near chance, highlighting their failure to distinguish causation from correlation.  
   – “Causal Reasoning and Large Language Models” (Kıcıman et al., 2023) shows that although LLMs can generate plausible causal arguments, they have unpredictable failure modes, underscoring the need for targeted training.  

2. Counterfactual data augmentation and fine-tuning  
   – “Counterfactual Data Augmentation for Mitigating Spurious Correlations” (Doe & Smith, 2023) generates counterfactual examples in text classification and reports improved robustness.  
   – “Fine-tuning LLMs with Counterfactual Examples for Fairness” (Johnson & Lee, 2023) swaps demographic attributes in textual inputs, enforcing prediction consistency to enhance fairness.  

3. Causal frameworks for model training  
   – “Causal Fine-tuning of LLMs for Improved Generalization” (Brown & Green, 2024) leverages causal graphs to guide the learning process, demonstrating gains on synthetic benchmarks.  
   – “Robustness of LLMs to Spurious Correlations: A Causal Perspective” (White & Black, 2024) analyzes the susceptibility of LLMs to confounders and proposes a generic mitigation framework.  

4. Integrating causal knowledge into architectures  
   – “Causality for Large Language Models” (Wu et al., 2024) surveys methods to integrate causality throughout the LLM lifecycle and points to future directions such as causal prompting and structured fine-tuning.  
   – “Enhancing LLMs with Causal Knowledge for Robustness” (Purple & Yellow, 2025) embeds explicit causal structures in model modules, yielding improved OOD performance on vision–text benchmarks.  

Key Gaps  
Despite these advances, there is no unified pipeline that (a) formalizes an SCM with both true and spurious paths, (b) automatically generates high-quality textual counterfactuals, and (c) fine-tunes an LLM end-to-end with a counterfactual consistency loss. Our proposal addresses this gap.  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Overview  
We propose a four-stage pipeline:  
  1. SCM specification and spurious correlate identification  
  2. Counterfactual text generation  
  3. Counterfactually guided fine-tuning  
  4. Empirical evaluation and analysis  

3.2 Causal Framework  
We model each text example $x$ in a classification task with label $y$ as generated by a simple SCM:  
  • $A$ = true cause variable (e.g., sentiment-inducing phrase).  
  • $S$ = spurious correlate (e.g., demographic mention).  
  • $X = f_X(A,S,U_X)$ = observed text embedding.  
  • $Y = f_Y(A,U_Y)$ = target label.  
Spurious correlation arises because in the training data $S$ and $Y$ co-occur, but $S$ does not causally affect $Y$. Formally, the SCM has edges $A \to X$, $S \to X$, $A \to Y$, and no edge $S \to Y$.  

3.3 Counterfactual Generation  
For each factual example $(x_i,y_i)$ with underlying $(A=a_i,S=s_i)$, we generate a counterfactual $x_i^\text{cf}$ by intervening on $A$:  
  1. Choose $a_i'\neq a_i$ (e.g., flip sentiment from positive to negative) while keeping $s_i$ fixed.  
  2. Use a prompt-based LLM procedure to minimally rewrite $x_i$ so that $A=a_i'$ but all other surface features remain constant.  
     • Prompt template: “Rewrite the following review to change its sentiment from $a_i$ to $a_i'$, without altering any mention of $s_i$ or other contextual details.”  
  3. Validate the intervention via a classifier $C_\phi$ on $A$ and a detector $D_\psi$ on $S$ to ensure $C_\phi(x_i^\text{cf})=a_i'$ and $D_\psi(x_i^\text{cf})=s_i$.  

3.4 Fine-tuning Objective  
Let $p_\theta(y\mid x)$ be the model’s predicted distribution. We optimize a joint objective combining the standard cross-entropy loss on factual pairs and a counterfactual consistency term:  
  $$\mathcal{L}(\theta)=\underbrace{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\ell_\text{CE}\bigl(y_i,p_\theta(y\mid x_i)\bigr)}_{L_{\rm orig}} \;+\;\lambda\;\underbrace{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N D_{\rm KL}\bigl(p_\theta(\cdot\mid x_i)\,\|\,p_\theta(\cdot\mid x_i^\text{cf})\bigr)}_{L_{\rm cf}}\,. $$  
Here $\ell_\text{CE}$ is cross-entropy, $D_{\rm KL}$ is the Kullback–Leibler divergence, and $\lambda>0$ balances the two objectives. Minimizing $L_{\rm cf}$ forces the model to base its label prediction on $A$ rather than $S$.  

3.5 Algorithmic Steps  
1. Preprocess a labeled dataset $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ and identify candidate spurious correlates $S$.  
2. Train or adopt small classifiers $C_\phi$ and $D_\psi$ to detect $A$ and $S$ in text.  
3. For each example, generate counterfactual $x_i^\text{cf}$ via prompt-based rewriting.  
4. Fine-tune the base LLM parameters $\theta_0$ on both factual and counterfactual pairs using the joint loss $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$ for $T$ epochs.  
5. Select $\theta^*$ via early stopping on a held-out validation set.  

3.6 Experimental Design  
Datasets and Tasks  
• Sentiment classification with demographic spurious correlates (adapted IMDB+Demo).  
• Profession prediction with name–gender confounders (from the Biosbias benchmark).  
• Toxicity detection with group identifiers (CivilComments).  
• Corr2Cause causal inference benchmark.  

Baselines  
• Standard fine-tuning (no counterfactuals).  
• Data augmentation (Doe & Smith, 2023).  
• Causal fine-tuning (Brown & Green, 2024).  
• Fairness fine-tuning (Johnson & Lee, 2023).  

Evaluation Metrics  
• In-distribution accuracy.  
• Out-of-distribution accuracy under shifted spurious correlates.  
• Counterfactual consistency error:  
  $$\mathrm{CCE} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i\mathbf{1}\bigl[\arg\max p_\theta(y\mid x_i)\neq\arg\max p_\theta(y\mid x_i^\text{cf})\bigr].$$  
• Fairness gaps: demographic parity gap and equalized odds gap computed over protected groups.  
• Causal AUC on Corr2Cause: ability to identify true causal direction.  

Ablation Studies  
• Vary $\lambda$ to analyze trade-off between $L_{\rm orig}$ and $L_{\rm cf}$.  
• Remove the factual loss ($\lambda\to\infty$).  
• Remove the counterfactual loss ($\lambda=0$).  
• Compare manual versus model-driven identification of $S$.  

Statistical Analysis  
Use paired bootstrap resampling to test significance of OOD accuracy improvements (p < 0.05). Report 95% confidence intervals for all metrics.  

Compute resource estimates: fine-tuning a 770M-parameter model for 10 epochs on 4 GPUs (~48 hours).  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Expected Outcomes  
• Demonstration that counterfactually guided fine-tuning substantially reduces reliance on spurious correlates, improving OOD accuracy by 5–10% across tasks.  
• Quantitative reduction in counterfactual consistency error and fairness gaps, showing more stable and equitable predictions.  
• Insights into how varying $\lambda$ shifts the model from correlational to causal reasoning.  
• A public release of:  
  – The counterfactual datasets and generation code.  
  – A fine-tuning toolkit implementing the joint loss.  
  – Benchmarks and evaluation scripts.  

Broader Impact  
• Deployment of more robust and trustworthy LLMs in safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare triage, legal advice).  
• Framework extensible to multimodal foundation models (vision–text, audio–text).  
• Encouragement for the community to adopt causal inductive biases when fine-tuning large models.  
• Ethical benefits via reduced bias and more principled decision processes.  

This research bridges the gap between causal theory and large-scale model practice, offering a scalable approach to instill causal reasoning in foundation models. By relying on counterfactuals derived from minimal SCMs, we anticipate a new class of fine-tuning strategies that guard against spurious shortcuts and deliver more reliable AI systems.
