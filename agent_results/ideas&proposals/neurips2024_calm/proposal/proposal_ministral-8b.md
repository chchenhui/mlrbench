### Title: Counterfactually Guided Fine-tuning for Robust Large Language Models

### 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, often outperforming human experts across various benchmarks. However, their impressive performance is often due to the capture of spurious correlations present in the training data, which can lead to brittle behavior under distribution shifts and unreliable predictions in real-world applications. This raises concerns about the trustworthiness and reliability of these models, especially in safety-critical domains such as healthcare and policy-making.

The integration of causal inference techniques can help address these challenges by ensuring that LLMs rely on stable causal relationships rather than spurious statistical correlations. Causal inference provides a systematic framework to understand and reason about the effects of interventions, enabling performance guarantees beyond the training distribution. However, translating the rigorous theoretical tools of causality into practical methods for large-scale, heterogeneous data is a significant challenge.

This research proposal outlines a counterfactually guided fine-tuning strategy for LLMs to enhance their robustness and generalization capabilities. The proposed method involves identifying potential spurious correlations, generating counterfactual textual pairs, and fine-tuning the model to learn causal mechanisms rather than spurious associations. This approach aims to improve out-of-distribution generalization and fairness in LLMs.

### 2. Methodology

#### 2.1 Data Collection

The data collection process involves gathering a diverse set of text data from various sources, ensuring the presence of both genuine causal relationships and spurious correlations. The dataset will be split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The dataset will also include demographic and other relevant features to facilitate the identification of spurious correlations.

#### 2.2 Identifying Spurious Correlations

To identify spurious correlations, we will employ a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we will use:

1. **Correlation Analysis**: Calculate the correlation coefficients between different features in the dataset to identify potential spurious correlations.
2. **Feature Importance**: Use feature importance measures such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to rank the importance of features in predicting the target variable.
3. **Causal Discovery Algorithms**: Apply algorithms such as PC (Peter and Clark) and FCI (Fast Causal Inference) to discover causal structures in the dataset.

#### 2.3 Generating Counterfactual Examples

Once spurious correlations are identified, we will generate counterfactual textual pairs to guide the fine-tuning process. The counterfactual examples will be generated by minimally altering the "cause" variable while keeping the spurious correlate constant. For instance, if a spurious correlation exists between age and income, we will generate pairs where the age is changed minimally while keeping the income constant.

The counterfactual textual pairs will be created using a simplified causal graph that represents the desired invariant relationship versus the spurious one. The causal graph will be used to generate textual examples that reflect the true cause-and-effect relationships.

#### 2.4 Fine-tuning the LLM

The fine-tuning process will involve training the LLM on the original dataset and the generated counterfactual pairs. The loss function will be designed to encourage consistent predictions across the counterfactual pairs, steering the model towards learning causal mechanisms rather than spurious associations.

The fine-tuning process can be mathematically formulated as follows:

\[ L = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{Loss}(y_i, \hat{y}_i) + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{Loss}(y_j, \hat{y}_j) \]

where \( N \) is the number of original training examples, \( M \) is the number of counterfactual examples, \( y \) is the true label, \( \hat{y} \) is the predicted label, and \( \lambda \) is a hyperparameter that controls the weight of the counterfactual examples in the loss function.

#### 2.5 Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness of the counterfactually guided fine-tuning strategy, we will use the following metrics:

1. **Out-of-Distribution Generalization**: Measure the model's performance on out-of-distribution test sets to assess its ability to generalize to unseen data.
2. **Fairness Metrics**: Evaluate the model's fairness by measuring the difference in performance across different demographic groups.
3. **Causal Inference Accuracy**: Assess the model's ability to make accurate causal inferences by comparing its predictions with ground truth causal relationships.

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

The expected outcomes of this research proposal include:

1. **Improved Robustness**: The counterfactually guided fine-tuning strategy will enhance the robustness of LLMs by reducing their reliance on spurious correlations, leading to better performance under distribution shifts.
2. **Enhanced Generalization**: The method will improve the out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to perform well on unseen data and different contexts.
3. **Increased Fairness**: By focusing on causal relationships rather than spurious correlations, the proposed method will help mitigate biases and improve fairness in LLMs.
4. **Interpretability**: The integration of causal inference techniques will make LLMs more interpretable, providing insights into the underlying causal mechanisms that drive their predictions.
5. **Contributions to the Field**: The research will contribute to the broader field of causal inference and large-scale machine learning, providing new tools and methods for enhancing the robustness and reliability of LLMs.
