**Title:** Counterfactually Guided Fine-tuning for Robust Large Language Models

**Motivation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) often capture spurious correlations present in training data, leading to brittleness under distribution shifts and unreliable behavior in real-world scenarios. Enhancing their robustness by ensuring they rely on causal rather than correlational patterns is crucial for trustworthy deployment.

**Main Idea:** We propose a fine-tuning strategy guided by causal counterfactuals to improve LLM robustness. First, identify potential spurious correlations (e.g., associating specific demographics with certain outcomes unrelatedly). Then, using a simplified causal graph representing the desired invariant relationship versus the spurious one, automatically generate counterfactual textual pairs. One text represents the factual observation, while the counterfactual minimally changes the "cause" variable but keeps the spurious correlate, forcing the model to predict the outcome based on the true cause. Fine-tuning the LLM with a loss function that encourages consistent predictions across these counterfactual pairs will steer it towards learning causal mechanisms over spurious associations, leading to improved out-of-distribution generalization and fairness.
