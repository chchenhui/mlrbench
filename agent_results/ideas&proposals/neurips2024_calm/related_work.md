**2. Key Challenges**

1. **Identifying Spurious Correlations**: Detecting and distinguishing spurious correlations from genuine causal relationships in large datasets is complex, as models may inadvertently learn and reinforce these correlations.

2. **Generating Counterfactual Examples**: Creating meaningful counterfactual examples that accurately reflect causal interventions without introducing biases or inaccuracies is challenging.

3. **Model Generalization**: Ensuring that models fine-tuned with counterfactuals generalize well to unseen data and different contexts remains a significant hurdle.

4. **Computational Complexity**: Implementing counterfactual-guided fine-tuning strategies can be computationally intensive, requiring substantial resources and time.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Developing reliable metrics to assess the effectiveness of counterfactual fine-tuning in improving robustness and fairness is essential but challenging.
