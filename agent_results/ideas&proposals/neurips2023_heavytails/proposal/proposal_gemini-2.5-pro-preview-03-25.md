## 1. Title: Leveraging Heavy Tails for Enhanced Generalization: An Adaptive Stochastic Gradient Amplification Framework

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Background
Heavy-tailed distributions, characterized by a higher probability of observing extreme values compared to distributions like the Gaussian, are ubiquitous in natural and complex systems. In machine learning (ML), their presence has often been viewed with apprehension, primarily associated with numerical instability, outlier sensitivity, and challenges in theoretical analysis that traditionally relies on finite variance assumptions. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the cornerstone of training deep neural networks, frequently generates stochastic gradients whose distributions exhibit heavy tails, particularly in large models or complex loss landscapes (Simsekli et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). This deviation from classical assumptions has spurred research into robust optimization techniques, often focusing on mitigating the perceived negative effects of heavy tails, such as gradient clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013) or normalization (Hübler et al., 2024; You et al., 2017).

However, a paradigm shift is emerging. Recent studies suggest that heavy-tailed phenomena, including heavy-tailed gradient noise and dynamics near the "edge of stability," might not be mere artifacts or nuisances, but could play a fundamental, even beneficial, role in the training process and generalization capabilities of deep learning models (Cohen et al., 2021; Raj et al., 2023; Dupuis & Viallard, 2023). The heavy tails might facilitate exploration of the loss landscape, helping the optimizer escape sharp local minima and find flatter minima, which are often associated with better generalization (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017). This perspective aligns with the goals of the "Heavy Tails in Machine Learning" workshop, which seeks to move beyond viewing heavy tails as a surprising 'phenomenon' and establish them as an expected behavior, repositioning theory and methodology accordingly.

Despite this growing recognition, current optimization strategies largely remain focused on *controlling* or *suppressing* heavy tails rather than *harnessing* them. Methods like gradient clipping arbitrarily truncate large gradients, while normalization rescales them, potentially discarding valuable information encoded in the tail structure. While shown to improve stability (Hübler et al., 2024; Armacki et al., 2024), these approaches might inadvertently hinder the exploration capabilities that heavy tails potentially offer.

### 2.2 Problem Statement and Research Gap
The core problem lies in the disconnect between the potential benefits of heavy-tailed gradients for exploration and generalization, and the prevailing optimization strategies designed to mitigate their effects. There is a lack of frameworks that actively and adaptively *leverage* the information contained within the tail structure of stochastic gradients to improve training dynamics and model performance. While recent theoretical works have made significant strides in analyzing SGD under heavy-tailed noise (Raj et al., 2023; Armacki et al., 2023, 2024; Liu & Zhou, 2023) and developing robust methods (Hübler et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2025; Yan et al., 2024), they primarily focus on ensuring convergence or stability *despite* heavy tails, or uniformly transforming gradients (e.g., normalization). The idea of dynamically *amplifying* or *moderating* the tail heaviness based on the training state to explicitly enhance generalization remains largely unexplored.

### 2.3 Research Objectives
This research proposes to bridge this gap by developing and evaluating a novel optimization framework, termed **Heavy-Tail Gradient Amplification (HTGA)**. The primary aim is to investigate whether controlled modulation of the gradient distribution's tail heaviness during training can lead to improved generalization performance. Our specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop an Online Tail Index Estimator:** Design and implement a computationally efficient algorithm to estimate the tail index (specifically, the $\alpha$ parameter of an $\alpha$-stable or Pareto-like distribution) of the stochastic gradient norm distribution in an online manner during training.
2.  **Design the HTGA Optimization Algorithm:** Formulate an adaptive optimization algorithm that utilizes the estimated tail index $\hat{\alpha}_t$ at each step $t$ to dynamically modulate the effective stochastic gradient used for parameter updates. This modulation aims to strategically amplify heavy-tailed characteristics (e.g., when exploration is needed) and potentially moderate them (e.g., during fine-tuning phases).
3.  **Empirically Validate HTGA:** Conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark image classification and language modeling tasks to compare the generalization performance and training dynamics of HTGA against standard optimizers (SGD, Adam) and heavy-tail robust methods (gradient clipping, normalization). We will particularly investigate performance in low-data regimes and explore the relationship between adaptive tail modulation and escaping poor local minima.
4.  **Analyze HTGA Dynamics:** Investigate the behavior of HTGA during training, focusing on the evolution of the estimated tail index $\hat{\alpha}_t$, the effective step sizes, the loss landscape traversal, and the correlation between these dynamics and final model generalization. Provide theoretical motivation and, if possible, preliminary analysis regarding the stability and convergence properties of HTGA.

### 2.4 Significance and Contribution
This research holds significant potential for both practical and theoretical advancements in machine learning.

*   **Practical Significance:** If successful, HTGA could offer a new optimization strategy that directly harnesses a naturally occurring phenomenon in deep learning training to improve model generalization, potentially leading to more robust and accurate models, especially when training data is limited.
*   **Theoretical Significance:** This work aims to shift the perspective on heavy tails in SGD from a problem to be managed to a potential resource to be leveraged. By directly linking the tail index of gradients to optimization strategy, we can gain deeper insights into the complex interplay between optimization dynamics, landscape geometry, heavy tails, and generalization. This directly contributes to the workshop's goal of repositioning theory around the expected nature of heavy-tailed behavior.
*   **Novelty:** Unlike existing methods that focus on clipping, normalization, or simply ensuring convergence under heavy tails, HTGA proposes a fundamentally different approach: adaptive *amplification* and *modulation* based on real-time tail index estimation. This offers a novel mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation in stochastic optimization.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Conceptual Framework
The core idea of HTGA is to dynamically adjust the optimization process based on the measured "heaviness" of the stochastic gradient distribution's tail. We hypothesize that:
*   A heavier tail (smaller tail index $\alpha$) correlates with larger, potentially more informative gradients that drive exploration. Amplifying this behavior might be beneficial when the optimizer is stuck or exploring a complex landscape.
*   A lighter tail (larger $\alpha$) might indicate convergence towards a flatter region or simply smaller gradients. Moderating amplification or even attenuating extreme gradients might be preferable for fine-tuning.

HTGA operates in a closed loop:
1.  Compute stochastic gradient $g_t$.
2.  Update the online estimate of the tail index $\hat{\alpha}_t$ using recent gradient norms $\|g_t\|$.
3.  Modulate the current gradient $g_t$ based on $\hat{\alpha}_t$ to produce an effective gradient $g'_t$.
4.  Update model parameters using $g'_t$.

### 3.2 Online Tail Index Estimation
Estimating the tail index $\alpha$ of a distribution from a stream of data presents challenges, requiring a balance between responsiveness to changes and statistical stability. We define the tail index $\alpha$ such that the probability density function $p(x)$ behaves like $p(x) \sim x^{-(\alpha+1)}$ for large $x$, or the complementary cumulative distribution function $P(X > x) \sim x^{-\alpha}$. Smaller $\alpha$ implies heavier tails.

We propose using a windowed or exponentially weighted version of a standard tail index estimator suitable for positive random variables (applied to gradient norms $\|g_t\|$). A potential candidate is the Hill estimator (Hill, 1975), adapted for online use. Given a sliding window of the $W$ most recent gradient norms $\{\|g_{t-W+1}\|, ..., \|g_t\|\}$, let $\|g\|_{(1)} \ge \|g\|_{(2)} \ge ... \ge \|g\|_{(W)}$ be the sorted norms in descending order. Using the top $k < W$ order statistics, the Hill estimator is:
$$
\hat{\alpha}_t^{(k)} = \left( \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \log \frac{\|g\|_{(i)}}{\|g\|_{(k+1)}} \right)^{-1}
$$
To make this computationally feasible online, we can maintain an approximate set of top-$k$ statistics within the window $W$ or use exponentially decaying weights. For instance, an exponentially weighted moment-based estimator related to Pickands estimator or adaptations of the Hill estimator for streaming data could be employed (e.g., using quantile estimation techniques on the stream). The choice of window size $W$ and the number of order statistics $k$ are hyperparameters that control the bias-variance trade-off of the estimate. We will investigate computationally cheaper approximations, possibly using running moments or specific quantile trackers.

### 3.3 Heavy-Tail Gradient Amplification (HTGA) Algorithm
The HTGA algorithm modifies the standard SGD update rule $\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta_t g_t$. Instead, it uses a modulated gradient $g'_t$:
$$
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta_t g'_t
$$
where $g'_t$ is derived from $g_t$ and the estimated tail index $\hat{\alpha}_t$. We propose the following modulation function:
$$
g'_t = M(g_t, \hat{\alpha}_t) = \left( \frac{\|g_t\|}{\tau_t} \right)^{\gamma(\hat{\alpha}_t)} \frac{g_t}{\|g_t\|} \cdot \tau_t = \|g_t\|^{\gamma(\hat{\alpha}_t)} \tau_t^{1-\gamma(\hat{\alpha}_t)} \frac{g_t}{\|g_t\|}
$$
Here:
*   $\|g_t\|$ is the norm of the stochastic gradient $g_t$.
*   $\hat{\alpha}_t$ is the online estimate of the tail index.
*   $\gamma(\hat{\alpha}_t)$ is the **adaptive amplification exponent**, a function of the estimated tail index. A simple choice could be a sigmoid-like function centered around a target tail index $\alpha_{target}$:
    $$
    \gamma(\hat{\alpha}_t) = \gamma_{max} \cdot \sigma(\beta (\alpha_{target} - \hat{\alpha}_t)) + \gamma_{min} \cdot (1 - \sigma(\beta (\alpha_{target} - \hat{\alpha}_t)))
    $$
    where $\sigma(x) = 1 / (1 + e^{-x})$ is the sigmoid function, $\beta > 0$ controls the transition sharpness, $\alpha_{target}$ is the desired tail index (e.g., $\alpha_{target}=2$ for borderline heavy tails), $\gamma_{max} > 1$ represents the maximum amplification exponent (applied when tails are lighter than target, i.e., $\hat{\alpha}_t > \alpha_{target}$), and $\gamma_{min} \le 1$ represents the minimum exponent (potentially attenuating, $\gamma_{min} < 1$, or neutral, $\gamma_{min}=1$, when tails are heavier than target). If $\gamma(\hat{\alpha}_t)=1$, we recover standard SGD scaling. If $\gamma(\hat{\alpha}_t)=0$, it resembles normalized SGD.
*   $\tau_t$ is a scaling factor introduced to maintain reasonable gradient magnitudes and potentially stabilize the process. It could be a running average of gradient norms, or a fixed hyperparameter. Its role is crucial to prevent divergence when $\gamma > 1$.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  Initialize parameters $\theta_0$, learning rate schedule $\eta_t$, HTGA hyperparameters ($\alpha_{target}, \beta, \gamma_{max}, \gamma_{min}, \tau_t$ update rule), tail estimator parameters ($W, k$). Initialize tail estimator state (e.g., empty window).
2.  For $t = 0, 1, 2, ...$ do:
    a.  Compute stochastic gradient $g_t = \nabla \mathcal{L}(f(\theta_t; x_t), y_t)$ for a mini-batch $(x_t, y_t)$.
    b.  Compute gradient norm $\|g_t\|$.
    c.  Update the online tail index estimator using $\|g_t\|$ to get $\hat{\alpha}_t$.
    d.  Update the scaling factor $\tau_t$ (if dynamic).
    e.  Calculate the amplification exponent $\gamma(\hat{\alpha}_t)$ based on $\hat{\alpha}_t$ and $\alpha_{target}$.
    f.  Compute the modulated gradient $g'_t = \|g_t\|^{\gamma(\hat{\alpha}_t)} \tau_t^{1-\gamma(\hat{\alpha}_t)} \frac{g_t}{\|g_t\|}$. Handle the case $\|g_t\|=0$.
    g.  Update parameters: $\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta_t g'_t$.
3.  End For

This adaptive modulation differs fundamentally from clipping (which only truncates large values) and normalization (which removes magnitude information). HTGA selectively amplifies or dampens gradient norms based on the *statistical properties* of recent gradients.

### 3.4 Theoretical Analysis (Preliminary)
While a full convergence proof is complex due to the adaptive, state-dependent nature of $\gamma(\hat{\alpha}_t)$, we aim to provide theoretical motivation. We can draw parallels with analyses of SGD under heavy-tailed noise (Raj et al., 2023; Armacki et al., 2024). Key points to explore:
*   **Stability:** How does the modulation affect stability? The $\tau_t$ term and the bounds on $\gamma$ ($\gamma_{min}, \gamma_{max}$) are crucial. We can analyze the expected squared norm of the update step and relate it to existing stability conditions.
*   **Convergence:** Under what assumptions on the loss function, noise, and adaptation dynamics can we show convergence (e.g., to a stationary point for non-convex objectives)? This might require bounding the adaptation speed or assuming the tail index stabilizes.
*   **Generalization:** Can we connect the adaptive amplification to concepts like escaping sharp minima or finding flatter minima, potentially linking $\alpha_t$ dynamics to generalization bounds like those explored by Dupuis & Viallard (2023)?

### 3.5 Experimental Design

*   **Datasets:**
    *   Image Classification: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100. Potentially Tiny ImageNet or a subset of ImageNet for scalability assessment. We will test both standard data regimes and low-data regimes (e.g., using only 10-20% of training data) where generalization is more challenging.
    *   Language Modeling: WikiText-2 or Penn Treebank.
*   **Models:**
    *   Images: Standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like ResNet-18, potentially VGG.
    *   Language: Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs) or small Transformer models.
*   **Baselines:** We will compare HTGA against:
    *   Standard SGD with momentum.
    *   Adam / AdamW (Kingma & Ba, 2014; Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019).
    *   SGD with Gradient Clipping.
    *   Normalized SGD (NSGD) / Adam variants with normalization (e.g., LARS, LAMB, if applicable).
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   Use standard deep learning libraries (PyTorch/TensorFlow).
    *   Implement the online tail estimator and the HTGA update rule carefully.
    *   Perform hyperparameter tuning for all methods (including baselines) using a validation set or cross-validation. Key hyperparameters for HTGA include $\eta_t$ schedule, momentum (if used), $\alpha_{target}, \beta, \gamma_{max}, \gamma_{min}$, estimator parameters ($W, k$), and the $\tau_t$ strategy.
    *   Run multiple trials with different random seeds for statistical significance.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Primary:** Test accuracy (classification) / perplexity (language modeling). Generalization Gap (difference between final training and test performance).
    *   **Secondary (Dynamics):**
        *   Training/Validation loss curves over epochs/iterations.
        *   Evolution of the estimated tail index $\hat{\alpha}_t$ over time.
        *   Distribution of gradient norms $\|g_t\|$ and modulated gradient norms $\|g'_t\|$ at different training stages.
        *   Effective learning rate or step size analysis.
        *   (Optional) Loss landscape visualization techniques (e.g., filter normalization, plotting loss along specific directions) to qualitatively assess exploration and convergence to flat/sharp minima.
