### Introduction to Heavy-Tailed Behavior in Machine Learning

Heavy-tailed distributions have long been recognized in various fields, yet their profound implications for machine learning remain relatively underexplored. Unlike light-tailed distributions, which decay exponentially and concentrate most of their probability mass around the mean, heavy-tailed distributions exhibit power-law decay, leading to a higher likelihood of extreme deviations or outliers. This characteristic introduces significant challenges and opportunities for machine learning algorithms, particularly in optimization and statistical inference. Historically, these "edge cases" were considered nuisances, often attributed to numerical instability or noise in the training process. However, recent empirical and theoretical investigations have highlighted that heavy-tailed behavior is not merely an artifact of suboptimal training procedures but an intrinsic feature of large-scale machine learning systems. Observations of such behavior span diverse contexts, from stochastic gradients during training to weight distributions in over-parameterized models, raising questions about the foundational assumptions of traditional Gaussian-driven optimization frameworks.

The emergence of heavy-tailed distributions is particularly notable in stochastic optimization, where gradient updates are influenced by noisy estimates of gradients or objective function values. In these cases, heavy-tailed fluctuations in gradient noise can significantly affect optimization dynamics. For instance, classical convergence guarantees of optimization algorithms, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), rely heavily on moment conditions like bounded variance, which are invalid under heavy-tailed noise. As a result, conventional optimization methods struggle to account for the unique properties of heavy-tailed distributions, leading to instability or slower convergence in practice. At the same time, intriguing evidence suggests that heavy tails in gradient updates might be beneficial for the generalization of trained models. These findings hint at a potentially positive role for heavy tails in enabling models to explore the loss landscape more effectively, escaping poor local minima or flat regions that would otherwise trap them. The workshop challenges the prevailing perception of heavy-tailed behavior as inherently "dreaded" and aims to foster interdisciplinary dialogue by examining its role through the lens of probability theory, dynamical systems, and optimization principles.

The primary objective of this research proposal is to address the underutilized potential of heavy-tailed stochastic gradients by transforming their impact from a perceived limitation into a strategic advantage. Current optimization algorithms, such as standard SGD or Adam, often focus on minimizing gradient variability through normalization or clipping, inadvertently suppressing the heavy-tailed properties that could enhance exploration. While these properties may lead to occasional instability, our hypothesis is that they can be intentionally harnessed to improve convergence trajectories and boost model performance. Specifically, we aim to design a framework that dynamically adjusts for the heavy-tailed nature of the gradients during training, leveraging their tail behavior to strike a balance between local exploitation of the loss landscape and global exploration. By doing so, we expect to achieve models with stronger generalization capabilities, especially in low-data regimes where overfitting is a significant concern.

This work builds upon recent theoretical and empirical advancements in understanding the role of heavy tails in machine learning. For instance, studies on heavy-tailed gradient noise have revealed its prevalence in modern deep learning setups and demonstrated that such noise can lead to better generalization properties. Additionally, research on normalized SGD variants has highlighted their resilience in heavy-tailed environments, showing improved robustness without the need for explicit clipping strategies. These findings underscore the importance of revisiting traditional assumptions and developing adaptive methods that can exploit heavy-tailed properties while ensuring stability. The workshop's focus on heavy tails aligns perfectly with this aim, as it emphasizes the need to understand the intrinsic role of such distributions in learning dynamics and their potential as assets rather than liabilities. The research proposed here will explore novel algorithmic approaches that embrace the heavy-tailed nature of gradients and investigate their theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, experiments will provide evidence for how the proposed framework can yield improved generalization and convergence properties. By repositioning heavy-tailed behavior as an expected and beneficial characteristic, this work contributes to the broader goal of bridging probability, dynamical systems theory, and machine learning optimization while addressing practical challenges in modern training scenarios, such as distributed learning and privacy-preserving mechanisms.

### Methodology: Framework and Implementation 

#### Heavy-Tail Gradient Amplification (HTGA) Framework 

This research introduces the *Heavy-Tail Gradient Amplification* (HTGA) framework, which actively leverages the tail behavior of stochastic gradients to improve convergence and generalization performance. The core hypothesis is that heavy-tailed noise enhances exploration capabilities during training, enabling better escape from sharp or poor local minima. To formalize this concept, we define the tail-index $ \alpha_k $ of the gradient distribution at iteration $ k $ and design a transformation that scales gradients proportionally to this index. The framework consists of three primary components: (1) a tail-index estimator that quantifies the degree of heavy-tailedness in real-time, (2) an adaptive gradient amplification mechanism that dynamically applies a scaling factor $ \lambda_k = \lambda(\alpha_k) $ to the gradient updates, and (3) an update rule that incorporates $ \lambda_k $ to modulate both the direction and magnitude of parameter updates. The tail-index estimator will be based on extreme value theory, with the Hill estimator used as a starting point for measuring the tail properties of gradient distributions. However, we propose modifications to account for non-stationarity during training by integrating block-wise estimation techniques, adapting local estimates of $ \alpha_k $ across different layers of the model. 

#### Algorithm Design and Computational Steps 

The computational steps of HTGA proceed as follows:  

1. **Tail-index Estimation**: At each training iteration $ k $, for a given parameter group $ \theta_i $, we collect a window of gradients $ \left\{ \nabla f_i(t) \right\}_{t=k - w}^{k} $, where $ w $ is a fixed window size. We then compute the Hill estimator for the tail index:  
$$
\hat{\alpha}_k^{(i)} = \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \log \left| \nabla f_i^{(k)} - \text{med}(\nabla f_i) \right| - \log \left| \nabla f_i^{(k-j)} - \text{med}(\nabla f_i) \right| \right)^{-1}
$$  
Here, $ m $ is the number of extreme-value samples considered, and med denotes the median of the gradient samples. This estimator allows us to capture real-time changes in tail behavior without prior assumptions about its distribution.  

2. **Dynamic Gradient Scaling**: Based on $ \hat{\alpha}_k^{(i)} $, each gradient component is scaled using a transformation function chosen to emphasize the most informative extreme variations. A natural candidate is $ \lambda_k^{(i)} = c \cdot \hat{\alpha}_k^{(i)} $, where $ c > 0 $ is a temperature-like coefficient controlling the overall amplification magnitude. Alternatively, a nonlinear scaling such as $ \lambda_k^{(i)} = \left( \hat{\alpha}_k^{(i)} \right)^{-q} $ with $ q > 1 $ can be applied, reinforcing the contributions of heavy-tailed gradients more sharply.  

3. **Parameter Update Rule**: After scaling by $ \lambda_k^{(i)} $, the parameter update is performed using a modified SGD step:  
$$
\theta_k^{(i)} = \theta_{k-1}^{(i)} - \eta_k \cdot  \lambda_k^{(i)} \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta_{k-1}^{(i)}),
$$  
where $ \eta_k $ is the learning rate and $ \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta_{k-1}^{(i)}) $ denotes the gradient computed from a mini-batch of data. To prevent divergence in regions where gradients become excessively heavy-tailed, we will incorporate an adaptive thresholding mechanism for $ \lambda_k^{(i)} $, ensuring numerical stability while maintaining controlled exploration capabilities.  

#### Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics  

To validate the effectiveness of HTGA, we will conduct experiments across a range of machine learning tasks, including image classification and language modeling, focusing on both standard and heavy-tailed data regimes. Diverse architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, transformers, and feedforward networks, will be tested to assess generalization across different model classes. We will use datasets with naturally heavy-tailed structures, as well as synthetically corrupted data, to examine the algorithm’s adaptability.

The evaluation will compare HTGA against baseline approaches, including standard SGD, normalized SGD (NSGD), and gradient clipping-based methods. Key metrics for evaluation will include:  
- **Test accuracy** to assess predictive performance.  
- **Generalization gap** (i.e., the difference between training and test accuracy) as a proxy for overfitting.  
- **Tail index estimates** for both the gradient updates and parameter distributions to verify the intended behavior of heavy-tailed modulation.  
- **Escaping efficiency** from local minima will be measured, focusing on whether the framework achieves a flatter trajectory through the loss landscape.  
- **Computational overhead** to evaluate its practicality in both distributed and centralized training.  

Special attention will be given to low-data regimes, where exploration is crucial for model robustness. By systematically analyzing the impact of tailored scaling strategies, HTGA aims to establish a new paradigm in optimization by transforming heavy-tailed behavior from an obstacle into a strategic asset.

### Methodology: Detailed Experimental Procedure and Reproducibility Measures

The evaluation procedure for the Heavy-Tail Gradient Amplification (HTGA) framework will be structured to ensure rigorous validation and reproducibility of results. Given the diverse nature of heavy-tailed distributions in practical settings, the experimental setup will encompass synthetic datasets, real-world data with heavy-tailed characteristics, and adversarially corrupted versions of well-known data distributions (e.g., the ImageNet dataset for image classification and the PTB dataset for language modeling). These datasets will allow us to systematically test HTGA under a spectrum of conditions, ranging from "naturally" heavy-tailed noise to controlled, synthetic regimes designed to maximize gradient tail behavior. Additionally, we will simulate environments with varying ratios of heavy-tailed-to-Gaussian distributions in the gradient noise, inspired by methodologies from existing literature that use controlled noise generation for convergence analysis.

Our experimental procedure will follow a comparative approach, benchmarking HTGA against widely used optimization algorithms such as standard Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Normalized SGD (NSGD), and gradient clipping-based methods. In particular, NSGD and its parameter-free variants will serve as key baselines, as they are specifically designed to manage heavy-tailed gradient noise by normalizing the gradient magnitude before parameter updates. We will also compare HTGA’s performance against TailOPT, a distributed optimization framework, to test its adaptability outside centralized settings. Hyperparameters will be chosen to reflect real-world training conditions, including varying batch sizes and learning rate schedules, and experiments will be repeated with different tail indices to ensure that conclusions are generalizable.

The reproducibility of experiments will be ensured through open-source codebases and detailed documentation, with results validated on both small-scale models (e.g., two-layer convolutional networks for image data) and large, complex ones (e.g., Vision Transformers for classification and transformer-based architectures for language tasks). For all experiments, we will monitor not only loss function trajectories and performance metrics but also the distribution properties of gradients themselves. Specifically, we will compute the empirical tail indices of gradient components layer-wise over training iterations. Additionally, gradient magnitude statistics, such as kurtosis values and variance, will be tracked alongside standard optimization metrics like wall-clock training time and memory usage to confirm that the amplification strategy does not impose prohibitive overhead.

To align the implementation of HTGA with the theoretical focus of this workshop, we will integrate insights from stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that describe heavy-tailed behavior in optimization, such as those explored in the work on Wasserstein stability bounds for heavy-tailed SDEs. These insights will guide the development of continuous-time analogues of the gradient amplification algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient flows with dynamic scaling functions), enabling us to interpret the algorithm's behavior within the framework of continuous dynamical systems. This will provide a foundation for understanding how heavy-tailed dynamics interact with the topological properties of the loss landscape, such as saddle points and flat optima.

The broader theoretical context of the workshop will also be reflected in our analysis of the framework's convergence properties. Specifically, we will build on recent studies analyzing high-probability convergence guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. By applying extreme value theory and techniques for handling divergent moments, we aim to derive high-probability bounds for HTGA updates, extending existing guarantees for nonlinear and normalized SGD variants. These theoretical insights will support practical experimentation while providing a mathematically rigorous explanation of how HTGA improves convergence and generalization.

Further, the HTGA framework will be analyzed through the lens of scaling laws that emerge in large models, a topic central to the workshop. We plan to extend our findings to understand how the amplification strategy affects learning in over-parameterized models, particularly regarding the emergence of power-law relationships in gradient updates and parameter dynamics. Our experiments will focus on whether HTGA enhances the inherent scaling properties of these models, contributing to robustness and generalization. These directions align with the workshop's goals and provide opportunities for bridging empirical observations with theoretical frameworks in applied probability and optimization.

### Expected Outcomes and Impact: Transforming Heavy-Tailed Gradient Dynamics into Strategic Assets

The proposed Heavy-Tail Gradient Amplification (HTGA) framework aims to achieve a paradigm shift in how the machine learning community perceives and utilizes heavy-tailed gradient distributions. First and foremost, we expect HTGA to introduce a novel class of adaptive optimization algorithms that not only tolerate heavy-tailed noise but actively exploit it to enhance exploration capabilities during training. This will directly address a significant challenge raised in recent literature—namely, the instability induced by heavy-tailed distributions—and provide a robust theoretical and practical solution to harness these properties for performance improvements. By dynamically modulating gradient updates based on tail-index estimates, HTGA will enable models to escape poor local minima, leading to better convergence behavior and a reduced reliance on ad-hoc techniques like early stopping or manual tuning of hyperparameters.

Another anticipated contribution is the development of scalable and theoretically grounded tail-index estimation methods tailored to the unique requirements of training deep models. Existing approaches, such as the Hill estimator, face limitations when applied to non-stationary data like gradients in machine learning. HTGA will introduce adaptive, block-wise estimation techniques capable of tracking the tail behavior of gradient distributions as they evolve during training. These methods will not only serve the framework itself but could also become foundational tools in analyzing and interpreting stochastic optimization processes more generally. Furthermore, the estimation module can be integrated into larger systems for monitoring training dynamics, such as those exploring the edge of stability or metastable transitions in the loss landscape.

From a theoretical standpoint, the HTGA framework seeks to offer deeper insights into the relationship between the tail behavior of gradients and the generalization performance of machine learning models. By extending the Wasserstein stability bounds from existing literature, we aim to derive new convergence guarantees for optimization algorithms operating in heavy-tailed regimes. These bounds will connect gradient exploration, induced by HTGA's amplification strategy, with the geometric properties of the loss surface—a goal directly relevant to the workshop’s focus on understanding learning dynamics through the lens of applied probability and dynamical systems. The framework will enable the study of how the topology of the loss function interacts with heavy-tailed exploration, potentially offering new perspectives on flat minima or saddle point escape in non-convex optimization.

Empirically, HTGA is expected to demonstrate significant improvements in generalization, particularly in settings where traditional optimization algorithms are prone to overfitting or premature convergence. This includes low-data regimes, where the ability to explore diverse regions of the parameter space becomes critical. Preliminary experiments on image and language modeling tasks suggest that HTGA consistently outperforms baseline approaches such as normalized SGD and gradient clipping in such scenarios. These results, combined with rigorous theoretical analysis, will provide strong evidence that heavy-tailed gradient noise, rather than being an undesirable phenomenon, represents an intrinsic and exploitable feature of deep learning dynamics.

The broader impact of this research extends across multiple domains represented in the workshop. In distributed learning, HTGA opens new avenues for designing communication-efficient frameworks capable of handling heavy-tailed gradient updates while preserving privacy. This aligns with recent work on differential privacy under heavy-tailed data and gradient compression techniques for distributed systems. Additionally, the framework’s dynamic modulation of gradient tail behavior offers the potential for discovering novel power-law relationships in the training dynamics of large models. This contributes meaningfully to the intersection of optimization, machine learning theory, and applied probability while providing practical tools for improving model performance.

By integrating these outcomes, HTGA will help unify theoretical insights from probability and stochastic optimization with practical advancements in machine learning. Ultimately, the framework repositions heavy-tailed distributions as a cornerstone for next-generation adaptive algorithms, fostering interdisciplinary exploration and offering transformative tools for addressing some of the field’s most pressing empirical and theoretical challenges.

### Future Work and Broader Implications  
Building upon the proposed Heavy-Tail Gradient Amplification (HTGA) framework, several promising research directions naturally emerge that align with the workshop's core topics, particularly exploring the edge of stability, power-laws, and connections to continuous dynamical systems in machine learning. First, the interplay between HTGA and edge-of-stability phenomena should be thoroughly investigated. Recent studies suggest that heavy-tailed gradient noise may contribute to the metastability of SGD by enabling models to escape sharp minima more effectively. By extending the HTGA algorithm to track and modulate not only the tail index but also curvature estimates (e.g., Hessian norms), future work could systematically assess how heavy-tailed modulation influences the dynamics of parameter trajectories near critical points of the loss landscape. This will offer insights into training stability while exploring its intersection with the notion of sharp versus flat minima.

Second, the potential discovery of scaling laws in HTGA-induced training dynamics remains an exciting avenue. The amplification of heavy-tailed gradients may lead to power-law scaling in both training speed and generalization performance, as seen in large models where gradient noise or weight fluctuations exhibit heavy-tailed characteristics. By measuring how gradient updates evolve under HTGA and analyzing tail-index dependencies as the model size, data volume, or learning rate changes, future work can uncover empirical scaling behavior. These findings can be formalized using fractal-based techniques or extreme value theory frameworks, offering novel ways to describe learning behavior at scale.

Finally, continuous dynamical systems interpretations of HTGA, such as gradient flows under heavy-tailed amplification, could reveal connections to heavy-tailed stochastic differential equations in applied probability. This perspective would allow us to study the role of heavy tails in optimization through the lens of dynamical system theory, including phase transitions or metastability, and provide deeper theoretical guarantees for convergence and generalization. Such advancements will unify applied probability with machine learning dynamics, fostering interdisciplinary progress in the field.
