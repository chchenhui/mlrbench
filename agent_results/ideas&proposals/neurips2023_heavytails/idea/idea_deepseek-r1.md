**Title:** Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Feature Learning for Improved Generalization in Deep Neural Networks  

**Motivation:** Heavy-tailed distributions are pervasive in neural network activations and gradients, often dismissed as problematic due to their association with instability. However, recent evidence suggests they may encode critical information about feature learning dynamics. Understanding the relationship between heavy-tailed representations and generalization could reshape training paradigms to exploit, rather than suppress, such behavior, unlocking new avenues for model robustness.  

**Main Idea:** This research will establish a theoretical link between heavy-tailed layer activations and generalization bounds, hypothesizing that fatter tails correlate with richer feature hierarchies. We will analyze tail indices (via extremal statistics) of activations in vision transformers and CNNs across tasks, correlating them with empirical generalization gaps. A novel regularization term encouraging "structured" heavy-tailed representations (e.g., promoting power laws in attention maps) will be developed, validated on ImageNet and out-of-distribution benchmarks. Expected outcomes include (1) quantitative evidence tying controlled heavy-tailedness to generalization, and (2) a practical method to guide networks toward beneficial tail behaviors, potentially improving robustness without sacrificing stability.
