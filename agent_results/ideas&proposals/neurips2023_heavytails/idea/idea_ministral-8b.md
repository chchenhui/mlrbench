### Title: Leveraging Heavy Tails for Improved Generalization in Machine Learning

### Motivation:
Heavy-tailed distributions are prevalent in various real-world phenomena and can significantly impact the performance of machine learning algorithms. While traditionally viewed as problematic due to their potential to create outliers and numerical instability, recent research has shown that these distributions can be beneficial. This research aims to harness heavy-tailed behaviors to enhance the generalization capabilities of machine learning models.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research will focus on developing a novel framework that incorporates heavy-tailed distributions to improve the generalization of machine learning models. The methodology involves:

1. **Data Transformation**: Transforming input data to have heavy-tailed distributions, particularly focusing on power-law distributions, which are common in many natural systems.
2. **Model Adaptation**: Designing machine learning models that are robust to heavy-tailed data, such as using robust optimization techniques and regularization methods that handle outliers effectively.
3. **Empirical Validation**: Evaluating the performance of these models on real-world datasets with known heavy-tailed properties and comparing them with traditional models.

Expected outcomes include:

- Improved generalization performance on datasets with heavy-tailed distributions.
- Development of theoretical insights into the role of heavy tails in machine learning.
- Practical guidelines for incorporating heavy-tailed behaviors into machine learning pipelines.

Potential impact:

- Enhanced performance of machine learning models in domains where heavy-tailed data is prevalent, such as finance, network science, and natural language processing.
- Advancements in the understanding of the relationship between heavy-tailed distributions and model generalization.
- Contribution to the broader field of applied probability and theoretical machine learning, challenging the conventional view of heavy tails as purely negative phenomena.
