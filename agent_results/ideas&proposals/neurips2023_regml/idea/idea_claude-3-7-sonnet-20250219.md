# RegulationGPT: A Framework for Automated Regulatory Compliance Evaluation of ML Models

## Motivation
The rapid deployment of machine learning technologies has outpaced the development of regulatory frameworks to govern them. While various regulations exist, evaluating ML models for compliance remains largely manual, inconsistent, and resource-intensive. This research addresses the critical need for automated tools that can systematically evaluate ML models against diverse regulatory requirements across jurisdictions. Without such tools, companies struggle to maintain compliance, regulators face challenges in enforcement, and individuals may be exposed to harmful algorithmic outcomes.

## Main Idea
RegulationGPT is a novel framework that translates regulatory requirements into quantifiable metrics and automated evaluation processes for ML models. The system will utilize a knowledge base of global ML regulations (GDPR, CCPA, AI Act, etc.) and decompose complex regulatory text into specific testable criteria using NLP techniques. For each model under evaluation, RegulationGPT will run a comprehensive suite of tests covering privacy, fairness, explainability, and data management requirements. The framework will generate detailed compliance reports highlighting areas of concern and suggesting remediation strategies. By providing a standardized approach to regulatory compliance evaluation, RegulationGPT will reduce compliance costs, improve regulatory consistency, and enable ML practitioners to build compliance considerations into their development process from the start.
