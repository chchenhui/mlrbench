**Title:** Quantifying and Mitigating Regulatory Tensions in Machine Learning: A Multi-Objective Optimization Framework  

**Motivation:** Regulatory frameworks often impose multiple, sometimes conflicting requirements (e.g., fairness, privacy, explainability) on ML models. Current research lacks systematic methodologies to address these tensions, potentially leading to suboptimal compliance or performance trade-offs. Understanding and quantifying these interactions is critical to designing models that holistically satisfy regulatory standards without sacrificing utility.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a multi-objective optimization framework to quantify trade-offs between regulatory principles and identify Pareto-optimal solutions. The framework will integrate metrics for fairness (e.g., demographic parity), privacy (e.g., differential privacy budgets), explainability (e.g., model complexity), and robustness (e.g., adversarial accuracy). By analyzing these metrics across diverse datasets and model architectures, the study will map conflict patterns and propose adaptive algorithms that adjust optimization priorities based on contextual regulatory demands (e.g., stricter privacy laws). Expected outcomes include: (1) a toolkit for visualizing and evaluating regulatory trade-offs, (2) guidelines for balancing conflicting requirements under specific constraints, and (3) open-source implementations of adaptive training algorithms. This work would enable practitioners to make informed decisions when navigating regulatory landscapes, fostering compliant and performant ML systems.
