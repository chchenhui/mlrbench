**Title:** "Regulatable Machine Learning: Bridging the Gap with Explanation-aware Models"

**Motivation:** The increasing deployment of machine learning (ML) systems necessitates robust regulatory frameworks to ensure fairness, privacy, and explainability. However, the operationalization of these regulations in ML models remains a significant challenge. This research aims to bridge this gap by developing explanation-aware models that align with regulatory principles.

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a novel framework for regulatable ML that focuses on embedding regulatory desiderata directly into model training. By integrating explainability, fairness, and privacy constraints into the model architecture, we aim to create models that are not only accurate but also compliant with regulatory guidelines. The methodology involves:

1. **Explainability-aware Training:** Incorporating explainability metrics, such as LIME or SHAP, into the training process to ensure models provide interpretable outputs.

2. **Fairness Constraints:** Using fairness-aware loss functions, such as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) or the Fairness through Unawareness (FU) approach, to enforce fairness in model predictions.

3. **Privacy Preservation:** Employing differential privacy techniques, such as adding noise to model outputs, to protect sensitive user data without compromising model performance.

The expected outcomes include:

- Development of a comprehensive framework for regulatable ML that integrates multiple regulatory principles.
- Empirical validation of the framework's effectiveness in ensuring fairness, explainability, and privacy in real-world datasets.
- Identification of potential challenges and limitations in operationalizing regulatory policies in ML models.

The potential impact of this research is significant. It provides a practical approach to aligning ML research with regulatory policies, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and ethical deployment of ML systems. Additionally, it contributes to the broader understanding of the operational challenges in ML regulation, fostering more effective regulatory practices.
