### Title: Policy2Constraint: Automated Translation of Regulatory Text into Constrained ML Training

### Introduction

The increasing deployment of machine learning (ML) in diverse applications has brought ethical and legal implications to the forefront. Governments worldwide have responded by implementing regulatory policies to safeguard algorithmic decisions and data usage practices. However, there is a considerable gap between current ML research and these regulatory policies. Translating these policies into algorithmic implementations is highly non-trivial, and there may be inherent tensions between different regulatory principles. This research aims to bridge this gap by automating the end-to-end pipeline from policy text to compliant model training.

#### Background

Machine learning models are increasingly being used in critical applications such as credit scoring, healthcare, and autonomous vehicles. However, these applications are subject to various legal and ethical regulations. For instance, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States impose strict rules on data usage and processing. Similarly, fair-housing laws in the United States require ML models to avoid discriminatory practices. Manually encoding these legal requirements into algorithmic constraints is labor-intensive, error-prone, and doesn't scale across evolving policies. This research aims to close this gap by automating the process of translating regulatory text into constrained ML training.

#### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:

1. **Automated Regulatory NLP**: Develop a domain-tuned semantic parser and named-entity recognition (NER) system to accurately extract rights, obligations, and prohibitions from legal documents.
2. **Formalization of Legal Norms**: Map extracted norms into first-order logic predicates and translate these into differentiable penalty functions.
3. **Constrained Optimization**: Integrate these penalties as soft constraints in the ML loss and solve via multi-objective optimizers.
4. **Validation and Benchmarking**: Validate the approach on case studies—ensuring anti-discrimination in credit scoring and GDPR-compliant data usage—measuring both task performance and regulatory adherence.

#### Significance

The significance of this research lies in its potential to automate the process of translating regulatory text into algorithmic constraints, thereby bridging the gap between ML research and regulatory policies. This can lead to more compliant and ethical ML systems, reducing the risk of legal and ethical breaches. Additionally, the proposed framework can help ML practitioners and policymakers better understand the trade-offs between compliance and performance, facilitating more informed decision-making.

### Methodology

#### Regulatory NLP

The first stage of the proposed framework involves applying domain-tuned semantic parsers and named-entity recognition (NER) to extract rights, obligations, and prohibitions from legal documents. This stage will utilize pre-trained language models fine-tuned on legal text datasets, such as the one used in the LegiLM paper (Zhu et al., 2024). The semantic parser will convert natural language regulations into structured representations, while the NER system will identify key entities such as data subjects, data controllers, and data processors.

#### Formalization

The second stage involves mapping the extracted norms into first-order logic predicates and translating these into differentiable penalty functions. This stage will involve developing a set of rules to convert legal language into logical statements and then into penalty functions that can be integrated into the ML loss. For example, a regulation stating that "data subjects have the right to be forgotten" can be translated into a penalty function that imposes a cost on the model if it retains data longer than the specified period.

#### Constrained Optimization

The third stage involves integrating these penalties as soft constraints in the ML loss and solving via multi-objective optimizers. This stage will utilize optimization techniques such as gradient descent with Lagrangian multipliers to balance the task performance and compliance objectives. The multi-objective optimizer will ensure that the model not only performs well on the task but also adheres to the regulatory constraints.

#### Experimental Design

To validate the proposed framework, we will conduct case studies on anti-discrimination in credit scoring and GDPR-compliant data usage. For the anti-discrimination case study, we will use a dataset of credit applications and apply the proposed framework to ensure that the ML model does not discriminate based on protected characteristics such as race or gender. For the GDPR-compliant data usage case study, we will use a dataset of customer data and apply the proposed framework to ensure that the ML model complies with GDPR requirements such as data minimization and consent.

#### Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation metrics for this research will include both task performance and regulatory adherence. Task performance will be measured using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Regulatory adherence will be measured using custom metrics that assess compliance with the extracted norms, such as the proportion of data subjects that have their data forgotten, the proportion of data that is anonymized, and the proportion of protected characteristics that are not used to make decisions.

### Expected Outcomes & Impact

#### Open-Source Toolkit

The expected outcome of this research is an open-source toolkit for auto-embedding policy constraints into ML training. This toolkit will include the domain-tuned NLP models, the formalization rules, and the constrained optimization framework. The toolkit will be made available to the research community, enabling other researchers and practitioners to build compliant ML systems.

#### Empirical Benchmarks

The research will also generate empirical benchmarks on compliance trade-offs. These benchmarks will provide insights into the trade-offs between compliance and performance, helping ML practitioners and policymakers make more informed decisions. The benchmarks will be published in a peer-reviewed journal or conference proceedings.

#### Guidelines for Scalable, Regulation-Aligned ML Development

Finally, the research will provide guidelines for scalable, regulation-aligned ML development. These guidelines will include best practices for automating regulatory compliance, recommendations for integrating compliance into the ML development lifecycle, and strategies for adapting to evolving regulations. The guidelines will be published in a white paper or technical report, making them accessible to the broader ML community.

### Conclusion

This research aims to automate the process of translating regulatory text into constrained ML training, thereby bridging the gap between ML research and regulatory policies. The proposed framework includes a three-stage process involving regulatory NLP, formalization of legal norms, and constrained optimization. The research will be validated on case studies of anti-discrimination in credit scoring and GDPR-compliant data usage, with evaluation metrics including task performance and regulatory adherence. The expected outcomes include an open-source toolkit, empirical benchmarks on compliance trade-offs, and guidelines for scalable, regulation-aligned ML development. This research has the potential to significantly impact the field of ML by making it more compliant and ethical, thereby reducing the risk of legal and ethical breaches.
