**Research Proposal: Causality-Aware World Models via Counterfactual Latent State Prediction**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
World models are critical frameworks for enabling intelligent agents to understand, predict, and interact with dynamic environments. While traditional approaches, such as RNNs and state-space models (SSMs), excel at capturing temporal correlations, they often lack explicit causal reasoning [1]. This limitation reduces their ability to generalize under novel interventions or respond robustly to unexpected scenarios, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare and robotics [2]. Recent advances in generative AI, such as diffusion models and transformer architectures, have improved predictive accuracy but still struggle with causal interpretability [3]. For example, models like Sora and Genie simulate complex environments effectively but fail to isolate the causal impact of specific actions on outcomes, limiting their adaptability [4].  

**Research Objectives**  
This project aims to bridge the gap between correlation-based prediction and causal reasoning in world models by:  
1. **Designing a causality-aware world model** that predicts both factual and counterfactual latent states under hypothetical interventions.  
2. **Developing a training framework** that integrates counterfactual queries and interventional signals to disentangle causal relationships.  
3. **Validating the model’s generalization** through zero-shot evaluation in simulated environments and analysis of learned latent structures.  

**Significance**  
By encoding causal relationships into latent states, the proposed model will enhance decision-making robustness in dynamic environments, such as autonomous systems and personalized medicine. This work aligns with the workshop’s focus on scaling world models through interpretable architectures and addresses key challenges in causality-aware AI [5].

### 2. **Methodology**  
**Research Design**  

#### **2.1 Data Collection**  
- **Synthetic Environments**: Generate datasets with ground-truth causal graphs (e.g., object dynamics, robotic manipulation tasks) to enable explicit evaluation of causal structure recovery.  
- **Real-World Benchmarks**: Utilize existing datasets like the CoPhy benchmark [6] (counterfactual physical interactions) and RoboNet [7] (robotic control sequences).  
- **Intervention Generation**: For each trajectory, apply synthetic interventions (e.g., perturbing actions, modifying object properties) to create paired factual and counterfactual sequences.  

#### **2.2 Model Architecture**  
The model comprises two interconnected components:  
1. **Temporal Dynamics Module**:  
   - A hybrid architecture combining a transformer encoder (for long-range dependencies) and SSM layers (for local smoothness) processes sequences of observations $o_{1:T}$ and actions $a_{1:T}$.  
   - **Latent State Encoding**: For time step $t$, the latent state $s_t$ is derived as:  
     $$
     s_t = \text{SSM}(\text{Transformer}(o_{1:t}, a_{1:t}))
     $$  
2. **Intervention-Aware Prediction Head**:  
   - Accepts perturbed actions $a'_t$ or states $s'_t$ and computes counterfactual latents $s^{cf}_t$ via a modified attention mechanism. The key, query, and value matrices in the transformer are conditioned on intervention signals, enabling dynamic reweighting of causal factors.  

#### **2.3 Training Objective**  
The model optimizes a dual-objective loss:  
1. **Factual Prediction Loss** $\mathcal{L}_{\text{fact}}$:  
   Standard autoregressive prediction of future latents:  
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{fact}} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \|s_{t+1} - f_{\theta}(s_t, a_t)\|^2
   $$  
2. **Counterfactual Prediction Loss** $\mathcal{L}_{\text{cf}}$:  
   Minimize divergence between predicted and ground-truth counterfactuals under interventions $do(a'_t)$:  
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{cf}} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} D_{\text{KL}}\left( p(s^{cf}_{t+1} | s_t, a'_t) \| q_{\phi}(s^{cf}_{t+1} | s_t, a'_t) \right)
   $$  
   where $D_{\text{KL}}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence.  
3. **Total Loss**:  
   $$  
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{fact}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{cf}} + \beta \cdot \text{Sparsity}(G)  
   $$  
   Here, $\lambda$ balances losses, and $\beta$ penalizes sparsity in the learned causal graph $G$ (encoded via attention weights).  

#### **2.4 Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against diffusion-based DCM [1], Causal Transformer [2], and standard world models (DreamerV3 [8]).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  1. **Intervention Generalization Accuracy**: Success rate in predicting outcomes of unseen interventions.  
  2. **Causal Structure Recovery**: Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) between learned and ground-truth causal graphs.  
  3. **Zero-Shot Transfer**: Performance in novel environments (e.g., robotics tasks with altered physics).  
  4. **Task-Specific Metrics**: Reward curves for downstream control tasks (e.g., robotic manipulation success rate).  
- **Ablation Studies**: Test contributions of the counterfactual loss and intervention-aware attention.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Generalization**: The model will outperform baselines in zero-shot intervention scenarios, measured by at least 25% higher accuracy in CoPhy tasks.  
2. **Causal Interpretability**: SHD scores will demonstrate alignment between learned and true causal graphs (target: SHD < 5 for synthetic benchmarks).  
3. **Robust Decision-Making**: In robotic control tasks, the model will achieve ≥90% success rates under dynamic perturbations.  

**Impact**  
By integrating causal reasoning into world models, this work will advance AI safety and adaptability in critical applications:  
- **Healthcare**: Simulating patient responses to treatments under comorbidities.  
- **Robotics**: Enabling robust manipulation in unstructured environments.  
- **Scientific Discovery**: Accelerating hypothesis testing via counterfactual simulations in physics/biology.  

The proposed framework will also provide a foundation for future research in causality-aware generative AI, addressing the workshop’s focus on modeling, scaling, and understanding world dynamics.
