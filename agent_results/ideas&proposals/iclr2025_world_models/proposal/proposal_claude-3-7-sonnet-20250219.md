# Causality-Aware World Models via Counterfactual Latent State Prediction for Robust Generalization

## 1. Introduction

The development of world models—computational frameworks that enable intelligent agents to understand, predict, and simulate their environments—represents a cornerstone in the pursuit of advanced artificial intelligence. These models aim to capture the underlying dynamics of complex systems, facilitating decision-making and planning across diverse domains. Traditional world models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in predicting future observations based on historical data. However, they predominantly leverage correlational patterns rather than true causal understanding, limiting their ability to generalize to novel situations or accurately predict the outcomes of interventions.

This limitation becomes particularly problematic in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, autonomous driving, and robotic control, where accurate anticipation of intervention outcomes is critical. For instance, a healthcare AI system might correlate certain symptoms with specific conditions but fail to understand how treatments causally affect patient outcomes. Similarly, autonomous vehicles trained on correlational patterns may struggle to navigate unfamiliar scenarios that require causal reasoning about how specific actions influence the environment.

The fundamental challenge lies in the distinction between prediction and intervention. While prediction relies on observational data to forecast future states based on past patterns, intervention requires understanding causal mechanisms to anticipate how specific actions will alter the natural progression of events. This distinction, formalized in Pearl's causal hierarchy (Pearl, 2009), highlights the limitations of purely correlational approaches.

Recent advances in causal inference and representation learning offer promising directions for addressing these challenges. Works like CoPhy (Baradel et al., 2019) demonstrate the potential of counterfactual learning for physical dynamics, while approaches such as DCM (Chao et al., 2023) leverage diffusion models for causal queries. However, a comprehensive framework that integrates causal reasoning directly into the latent representations of world models remains an open research area.

Our research aims to bridge this gap by developing causality-aware world models via counterfactual latent state prediction. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that training models to predict not only future states but also counterfactual states resulting from hypothetical interventions will induce the formation of causally structured latent representations. These representations should implicitly encode causal relationships, enabling more accurate predictions under novel interventions and improving generalization to unseen scenarios.

The significance of this research extends beyond technical advances in predictive modeling. By enhancing the causal understanding of world models, we aim to improve their reliability, interpretability, and applicability across domains where robust decision-making under uncertainty is paramount. This represents a step toward more trustworthy AI systems that can reason about the consequences of actions in complex, dynamic environments.

## 2. Methodology

Our methodology centers on developing a novel training framework that induces world models to learn causally structured latent representations through counterfactual state prediction. The approach consists of several key components: model architecture, data preprocessing, training procedure, and evaluation metrics.

### 2.1 Model Architecture

We propose a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of Transformer models for capturing long-range dependencies with State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. The core of our model consists of:

1. **Encoder Network**: A neural network $E$ that maps observations $o_t$ to latent states $z_t$:
   $$z_t = E(o_t)$$

2. **Dynamics Model**: A hybrid Transformer-SSM network that predicts future latent states given past states and actions:
   $$\hat{z}_{t+1:t+H} = D(z_{t-K:t}, a_{t:t+H-1})$$
   
   where $H$ is the prediction horizon and $K$ is the history length.

3. **Decoder Network**: A neural network $G$ that reconstructs observations from latent states:
   $$\hat{o}_t = G(z_t)$$

4. **Causal Intervention Module (CIM)**: A novel component that processes intervention signals and modulates the dynamics model to predict counterfactual outcomes:
   $$\hat{z}^{cf}_{t+1:t+H} = D_{CIM}(z_{t-K:t}, a_{t:t+H-1}, i_{t:t+H-1})$$
   
   where $i_{t:t+H-1}$ represents intervention signals specifying which variables are being manipulated and their new values.

The CIM implements a causal attention mechanism that selectively modulates how past states influence future predictions based on the intervention. Mathematically, standard self-attention in transformers computes:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

Our causal attention mechanism extends this by incorporating intervention information:

$$\text{CausalAttention}(Q, K, V, I) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \odot M_I\right)V$$

where $M_I$ is an attention mask derived from the intervention $I$ that modulates the attention weights to respect the causal structure implied by the intervention.

### 2.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing

Our method requires datasets with interventional samples. We will utilize:

1. **Simulated Environments**: Physics-based environments (MuJoCo, PyBullet) and game environments (Atari, ProcGen) where we can systematically intervene on state variables and observe outcomes.

2. **Causal Dataset Generation**: For each environment, we generate:
   - Standard trajectories following the natural dynamics
   - Interventional trajectories where we intervene on specific variables
   - Paired samples (pre-intervention, post-intervention) for counterfactual learning

3. **Data Augmentation**: We employ techniques to enrich the intervention space:
   - Random intervention generation
   - Gradual intervention strength variation
   - Combinatorial interventions on multiple variables

### 2.3 Training Procedure

Our training procedure consists of multiple phases and objectives:

#### Phase 1: World Model Pretraining
The model is first trained to predict future observations without interventions:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{wm}} = \mathbb{E}_{(o_{t-K:t+H}, a_{t:t+H-1})} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{H} \| \hat{o}_{t+i} - o_{t+i} \|^2 \right]$$

#### Phase 2: Intervention-Aware Training
We then introduce interventional data and train the model to predict counterfactual outcomes:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{cf}} = \mathbb{E}_{(o_{t-K:t+H}, a_{t:t+H-1}, i_{t:t+H-1}, o^{cf}_{t+1:t+H})} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{H} \| \hat{o}^{cf}_{t+i} - o^{cf}_{t+i} \|^2 \right]$$

where $o^{cf}_{t+1:t+H}$ are the observed outcomes after intervention $i_{t:t+H-1}$.

#### Phase 3: Causal Representation Learning
To explicitly encourage causally structured representations, we introduce a contrastive learning objective:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z^{cf}, z^{cf}_{\text{true}}) / \tau)}{\sum_{z' \in Z_{\text{neg}}} \exp(\text{sim}(z^{cf}, z') / \tau)}$$

where $z^{cf}$ is the predicted counterfactual state, $z^{cf}_{\text{true}}$ is the encoded true counterfactual observation, $Z_{\text{neg}}$ is a set of negative examples (including states from different interventions), and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.

#### Final Objective
The complete training objective combines these components:

$$\mathcal{L} = \lambda_{\text{wm}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{wm}} + \lambda_{\text{cf}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{cf}} + \lambda_{\text{causal}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}} + \lambda_{\text{reg}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}$ is a regularization term (e.g., KL divergence to enforce structured latent spaces) and $\lambda$ terms are weighting hyperparameters.

### 2.4 Algorithm

The complete training algorithm is as follows:

1. **Initialize** encoder E, dynamics model D, decoder G, and causal intervention module CIM
2. **For** each epoch:
   a. Sample batch of standard trajectories $(o_{t-K:t+H}, a_{t:t+H-1})$
   b. Sample batch of interventional trajectories $(o_{t-K:t}, a_{t:t+H-1}, i_{t:t+H-1}, o^{cf}_{t+1:t+H})$
   c. Encode observations: $z_{t-K:t} = E(o_{t-K:t})$
   d. Predict standard future states: $\hat{z}_{t+1:t+H} = D(z_{t-K:t}, a_{t:t+H-1})$
   e. Predict counterfactual states: $\hat{z}^{cf}_{t+1:t+H} = D_{CIM}(z_{t-K:t}, a_{t:t+H-1}, i_{t:t+H-1})$
   f. Decode predicted states: $\hat{o}_{t+1:t+H} = G(\hat{z}_{t+1:t+H})$, $\hat{o}^{cf}_{t+1:t+H} = G(\hat{z}^{cf}_{t+1:t+H})$
   g. Compute losses $\mathcal{L}_{\text{wm}}$, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{cf}}$, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}$
   h. Update parameters using gradient descent on combined loss $\mathcal{L}$
