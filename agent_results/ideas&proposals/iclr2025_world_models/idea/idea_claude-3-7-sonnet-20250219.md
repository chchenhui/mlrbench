# Causality-Guided World Models for Interpretable Reinforcement Learning

## Motivation
Current world models often function as black boxes, capturing correlations without explaining the causal mechanisms underlying environment dynamics. This limitation hinders interpretability, generalization to novel scenarios, and effective decision-making in complex domains. By explicitly modeling causal relationships within world models, we can create more robust and explainable AI systems that better understand environment rules and dynamics. This research addresses fundamental challenges in understanding world rules while improving model-based reinforcement learning applications.

## Main Idea
We propose a framework that integrates causal discovery algorithms with world model architectures to learn explicit causal structures from agent interactions. The approach consists of three components: (1) a causal discovery module that identifies potential causal relations from observational and interventional data; (2) a causal world model encoder that represents these relationships as a structured latent space; and (3) a planning algorithm that leverages the causal representation for more efficient exploration and policy learning. The model will be trained using a hybrid loss function combining reconstruction accuracy, causal structure validity, and downstream task performance. We will evaluate this approach in environments requiring understanding of physical dynamics and multi-agent interactions, measuring both performance and interpretability metrics. The expected outcome is a world model that not only predicts future states accurately but also provides causal explanations for its predictions.
