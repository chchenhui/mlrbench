Title: Graph-Driven Active Learning for Multi-modal Perturbation in Single-Cell Genomics

Motivation:  
High-throughput perturbation screens (e.g., CRISPR) paired with single-cell multi-omics generate vast, complex datasets, but exhaustive exploration of perturbation space is infeasible. Efficiently selecting the next experiments to perform is critical for uncovering causal gene networks, accelerating target identification, and reducing costly wet-lab iterations.

Main Idea:  
We propose a Graph-Driven Active Learning framework that models cells, genes, and perturbations as heterogeneous nodes in a graph neural network (GNN). Edges encode relationships derived from single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and proteomics. At each iteration, the model estimates uncertainty and expected information gain for untested perturbations using Bayesian GNNs combined with optimal‐transport-based modality alignment. An acquisition function ranks candidate perturbations by their potential to reduce network uncertainty. Selected experiments are performed in silico (via generative latent models) and in vitro (CRISPR screens), and their results update the graph.  
Expected outcomes include a 40–60% reduction in experimental burden, discovery of high-confidence causal gene modules, and a generalizable pipeline for active, multi-modal experimental design in drug discovery.
