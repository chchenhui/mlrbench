# Foundation Models for Genomic Regulatory Circuits: Decoding Long-Range Dependencies for Drug Target Discovery

## Introduction

The intricate mechanisms governing gene expression and regulation remain one of the most challenging areas in modern biology, with profound implications for both understanding disease pathogenesis and advancing therapeutic development. Despite remarkable advances in genomic technologies and the rapid accumulation of multi-omics data, our ability to interpret the complex regulatory relationships that determine cellular function and response to perturbations is still limited. This gap in understanding represents a critical bottleneck in drug discovery, where approximately 90% of drug candidates fail in clinical trials, often due to inadequate understanding of disease mechanisms and target biology (Dowden & Munro, 2019).

Recent years have witnessed the transformative impact of foundation models in natural language processing, computer vision, and protein structure prediction. These models, trained on vast amounts of data to capture underlying patterns and relationships, are capable of representing complex dependencies that can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. However, the field of genomic regulation has yet to fully benefit from similar approaches that can effectively model the "language" of gene regulation across diverse cellular contexts and conditions.

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are inherently complex systems characterized by multiple layers of control, including transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, and non-coding RNAs that operate across varying genomic distances to regulate gene expression. Current computational approaches often struggle to capture the full complexity of these networks, particularly long-range dependencies that span tens or hundreds of kilobases in the genome. Furthermore, the highly context-specific nature of gene regulation—with dramatic differences across cell types, developmental stages, and disease states—adds another layer of complexity that requires sophisticated modeling approaches.

This research proposal addresses these challenges by developing a novel foundation model for genomic regulatory circuits that specifically targets the modeling of complex regulatory relationships and long-range dependencies. We aim to create a versatile framework capable of learning the grammar of gene regulation from diverse datasets and predicting cellular responses to genetic or chemical perturbations. By combining advances in attention-based architectures, graph neural networks, and representation learning, our approach will enable more accurate in silico screening of potential drug targets by simulating downstream effects of specific genomic interventions.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize target identification for novel therapeutics and provide deeper insights into disease mechanisms. By developing a model that can accurately capture regulatory relationships and predict the consequences of genomic perturbations, we will provide researchers with a powerful tool for prioritizing drug targets, understanding off-target effects, and identifying novel therapeutic strategies for complex diseases.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

Our model will be trained on a comprehensive collection of genomic datasets that capture various aspects of gene regulation across different cell types and conditions:

1. **Gene Expression Data**:
   - RNA-seq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project covering 54 tissue types
   - Single-cell RNA-seq data from the Human Cell Atlas spanning major cell types
   - Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) expression data

2. **Regulatory Element Annotations**:
   - ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics chromatin accessibility data (ATAC-seq, DNase-seq)
   - ChIP-seq data for key transcription factors and histone modifications
   - Enhancer-promoter interactions from Hi-C and ChIA-PET experiments

3. **Perturbation Data**:
   - CRISPR knockout/knockdown experiments from the Connectivity Map (CMap)
   - Drug treatment gene expression profiles from LINCS L1000
   - Disease-associated genetic variants from GWAS and disease databases

Data preprocessing will include:
- Normalization of expression data using quantile normalization and log-transformation
- Integration of genomic coordinates across different assays using reference genome mapping
- Quality control filtering based on coverage, reproducibility, and technical variability
- Construction of baseline regulatory networks using existing methods (e.g., GENIE3, GRNBoost2) to serve as initialization for our model

### Model Architecture

Our proposed model, which we name **RegNetTrans** (Regulatory Network Transformer), combines elements of transformer-based architectures with graph neural networks to capture both sequence-level features and network-level dependencies. The model consists of three main components:

#### 1. Multi-scale Attention Module

This module captures regulatory information at different genomic scales using a hierarchical attention mechanism:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

where $Q$, $K$, and $V$ represent query, key, and value matrices derived from input embeddings, and $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors.

To capture multi-scale interactions, we implement a hierarchical attention scheme:

$$\text{MultiScaleAttn}(X) = \text{Concat}(\text{Attn}_1(X), \text{Attn}_2(X_p), ..., \text{Attn}_L(X_g))$$

where $X$ represents sequence-level features, $X_p$ represents promoter-level features, and $X_g$ represents gene-level features aggregated at different scales. $L$ is the number of genomic scales considered.

#### 2. Regulatory Graph Induction Network

This component explicitly models gene-gene and enhancer-gene interactions as a graph structure:

$$Z = \text{GNN}(X, A)$$

where $X$ represents node features (genes and regulatory elements), $A$ is the adjacency matrix representing regulatory interactions, and $Z$ is the updated node representation.

We employ a Graph Attention Network v2 (GATv2) architecture to learn edge weights in the regulatory network:

$$e_{ij} = \text{LeakyReLU}(W_a^T [W_h h_i || W_h h_j])$$
$$\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp(e_{ij})}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}_i} \exp(e_{ik})}$$
$$h_i' = \sigma\left(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} \alpha_{ij} W_h h_j\right)$$

where $h_i$ and $h_j$ are node features, $W_a$ and $W_h$ are learnable weight matrices, $\alpha_{ij}$ is the attention coefficient, and $\mathcal{N}_i$ denotes the neighborhood of node $i$.

To enhance robustness against noise in gene expression data, we integrate quadratic neurons inspired by Zhang et al. (2023):

$$y = \sigma(x^T W x + b)$$

where $W$ is a weight matrix, $x$ is the input vector, $b$ is a bias term, and $\sigma$ is an activation function.

#### 3. Perturbation Prediction Module

This module predicts gene expression changes in response to genetic or chemical perturbations:

$$\Delta E = f_{\theta}(G, P)$$

where $G$ is the learned regulatory graph, $P$ is a perturbation vector (e.g., gene knockout or drug treatment), and $\Delta E$ is the predicted change in gene expression. The function $f_{\theta}$ is implemented as a message-passing neural network that propagates perturbation effects through the regulatory graph.

The complete RegNetTrans architecture integrates these components through a joint training process:

1. Encode gene expression and regulatory data into initial embeddings
2. Process embeddings through the multi-scale attention module
3. Induce a regulatory graph structure using the graph induction network
4. Predict perturbation effects using the perturbation prediction module
5. Update model parameters using a composite loss function

### Training Procedure

We employ a multi-stage training strategy:

1. **Pretraining**: The model is pretrained on large-scale genomic data to learn general regulatory patterns:
   - Masked gene expression prediction (similar to masked language modeling)
   - Regulatory element prediction from sequence and expression data
   - Self-supervised contrastive learning to differentiate between related cell types

2. **Fine-tuning**: The pretrained model is fine-tuned on specific tasks:
   - Predicting gene expression changes in response to perturbations
   - Identifying key regulatory elements for specific genes
   - Constructing cell type-specific regulatory networks

The training objective combines multiple loss functions:

$$\mathcal{L} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{exp}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{pert}} + \lambda_4 \mathcal{L}_{\text{prior}}$$

where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{exp}}$ is the expression prediction loss (mean squared error)
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}$ is the regulatory network reconstruction loss
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{pert}}$ is the perturbation prediction loss
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{prior}}$ is a prior knowledge integration loss based on known regulatory interactions
- $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3, \lambda_4$ are hyperparameters balancing the contribution of each loss component

To address computational efficiency challenges with large genomic datasets, we implement:
- Gradient accumulation for handling large batch sizes
- Mixed-precision training to reduce memory requirements
- Distributed training across multiple GPUs

### Evaluation Framework

We will evaluate our model through a comprehensive set of experiments:

1. **Regulatory Network Reconstruction**:
   - Comparison with gold-standard GRNs from model organisms (E. coli, yeast)

2. **Perturbation Response Prediction**:
   - Prediction of gene expression changes following CRISPR perturbations
   - Evaluation using held-out CRISPR screens and drug treatment datasets
   - Metrics: Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and RMSE between predicted and actual expression changes

3. **Target Prioritization Evaluation**:
   - Identification of known essential genes in cancer cell lines
   - Recovery of established drug targets for specific diseases
   - Enrichment analysis of predicted targets in relevant pathways

4. **Ablation Studies**:
   - Contribution of each model component to overall performance
   - Effect of different data types on model accuracy
   - Impact of model size and training data volume

5. **Case Studies**:
   - Application to specific disease contexts (cancer, neurodegeneration, autoimmune)
   - Analysis of disease-associated regulatory circuits
   - Identification of novel therapeutic targets

For experimental validation, we will collaborate with experimental labs to test selected predictions:
