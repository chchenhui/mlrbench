# Foundation Model for Genomic Circuits: Understanding Regulatory Dependencies

## Motivation
Understanding gene regulatory networks is crucial for drug discovery and disease mechanism elucidation. Traditional methods often fail to capture complex, long-range dependencies in genomic sequences that control gene expression across cellular contexts. These regulatory circuits are fundamental to cellular function, yet remain poorly modeled due to the high-dimensionality of genomic data and context-specific regulation. Improving our ability to model these regulatory relationships would dramatically enhance target identification for novel therapeutics and provide insights into disease mechanisms.

## Main Idea
We propose developing a foundation model that specifically captures genomic regulatory circuits through a novel architecture combining attention mechanisms with graph neural networks. The model would be pre-trained on diverse genomic datasets (ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx) to learn the grammar of gene regulation across cell types and conditions. Unlike existing approaches, our model incorporates three key innovations: (1) a multi-scale attention mechanism that captures both local sequence features and global regulatory patterns; (2) a regulatory graph induction component that explicitly learns gene-gene and enhancer-gene interactions; and (3) a perturbation prediction module that forecasts cellular responses to genetic or chemical interventions. The model would enable in silico screening of potential drug targets by simulating the downstream effects of perturbing specific genomic elements, potentially revolutionizing how we identify therapeutic targets and understand disease mechanisms.
