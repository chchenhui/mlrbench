    - **Year**: 2024

**Key Challenges**

1. **Perpetuation of Biases**: AI systems trained on biased data can reinforce existing disparities, leading to unfair treatment outcomes.

2. **Dynamic Feedback Loops**: The continuous interaction between AI recommendations and patient behaviors can create complex feedback loops that are difficult to predict and control.

3. **Explainability and Trust**: Lack of transparency in AI decision-making processes can erode patient trust and hinder the adoption of AI-driven interventions.

4. **Longitudinal Impact Assessment**: Measuring the long-term effects of AI interventions on diverse patient populations is challenging due to variability in individual responses and external factors.

5. **Integration of Causal Analysis**: Incorporating causal mediation analysis into AI systems to identify and mitigate bias requires sophisticated modeling and computational resources.
