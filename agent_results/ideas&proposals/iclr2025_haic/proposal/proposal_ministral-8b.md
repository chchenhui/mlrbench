# Unraveling Long-Term Coevolution: A Framework for Mitigating Bias in Dynamic Human-AI Feedback Loops in Healthcare

## Introduction

The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare has the potential to revolutionize patient care and outcomes. AI systems can provide personalized treatment plans, predict disease progression, and optimize resource allocation. However, the dynamic and bidirectional nature of human-AI interactions presents unique challenges, particularly in terms of bias and fairness. As AI systems adapt to human behavior and vice versa, feedback loops can emerge that perpetuate or amplify existing socio-technical biases, leading to inequitable healthcare outcomes. This research proposal aims to address these challenges by developing a framework to model and mitigate bias in dynamic human-AI feedback loops within healthcare.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to design and validate a hybrid methodology that models and mitigates bias in dynamic human-AI feedback loops in healthcare. Specifically, the research aims to:

1. Develop a simulation framework to model the coevolution of AI agents and patients over time.
2. Implement a **bias-aware co-correction** mechanism that dynamically tracks and addresses shifts in health disparities.
3. Validate the framework through a case study in diabetes management, assessing its impact on health equity outcomes.
4. Introduce a new metric, *looping inequity*, to measure the divergence in health equity outcomes between scenarios with and without sustained AI-patient interaction.

### Significance

The significance of this research lies in its potential to bridge algorithmic fairness with participatory AI design, offering actionable insights for deploying equitable long-term AI systems in healthcare. By addressing the challenges of bias perpetuation and dynamic feedback loops, this framework can help ensure that AI systems maintain fairness and efficacy as both humans and algorithms coevolve over time. This work is particularly relevant in high-risk populations where health disparities are prevalent, and where the impact of AI-driven interventions can be most significant.

## Methodology

### Simulation Framework

The simulation framework will model the coevolution of AI agents and patients over time. The framework will consist of two main components: the AI agent and the patient model.

#### AI Agent Model

The AI agent will be trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from human feedback (RLHF). The agent will receive feedback from patients based on their adherence to AI-driven treatment plans and other relevant factors. The agent's policy will be updated iteratively to maximize patient adherence and clinical outcomes.

The RL algorithm will be based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which is known for its stability and sample efficiency. The agent's policy $\pi_{\theta}(a|s)$ will be parameterized by a neural network, and the objective function will be defined as follows:

$$
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \left[R(s_t, a_t) - c \hat{V}_{\theta}(s_{t+1})\right]\right]
$$

where $R(s_t, a_t)$ is the reward function, $c$ is a coefficient, and $\hat{V}_{\theta}(s_{t+1})$ is the estimated value function.

#### Patient Model

The patient model will simulate the behavior of patients in response to AI-driven interventions. The model will take into account factors such as treatment adherence, environmental stressors, and patient demographics. The patient's behavior will be modeled using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a reward function that reflects clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction.

### Bias-Aware Co-Correction Mechanism

The bias-aware co-correction mechanism will dynamically track shifts in health disparities and identify how patient behaviors mediate algorithmic bias. The mechanism will consist of two main components: causal mediation analysis and patient explanations.

#### Causal Mediation Analysis

Causal mediation analysis will be used to identify the mechanisms by which patient behaviors mediate algorithmic bias. The analysis will be based on the following causal model:

$$
Y = c + \alpha X + \beta M + \epsilon
$$

where $Y$ is the outcome variable (e.g., glycemic control), $X$ is the treatment variable (AI-driven intervention), $M$ is the mediator variable (patient behavior), and $\epsilon$ is the error term. The causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ through $M$ will be estimated using the following formula:

$$
\text{mediation effect} = \alpha \beta
$$

#### Patient Explanations

Patient explanations will be generated to inform patients about the tradeoffs associated with AI-driven interventions. The explanations will be designed to enhance patient trust and promote adherence to treatment plans. The explanations will be based on the causal mediation analysis results and will be delivered through a user-friendly interface.

### Experimental Design

The framework will be validated through a case study in diabetes management. The case study will involve a simulated population of patients with diverse demographics and health conditions. The AI agent will be trained to provide personalized treatment plans based on patient data, and the patient model will simulate patient behavior in response to these plans.

The case study will be conducted in two scenarios: one with the bias-aware co-correction mechanism and one without. The primary outcome measures will be:

1. **Health Equity Outcomes**: Measured using the looping inequity metric, which will compare health equity outcomes between the two scenarios.
2. **Patient Empowerment**: Assessed through patient surveys and interviews.
3. **Clinical Effectiveness**: Evaluated using clinical outcome measures such as glycemic control and treatment adherence.

### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the framework will be evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Looping Inequity**: The divergence in health equity outcomes between the two scenarios.
2. **Reduction in Health Disparities**: The percentage reduction in health disparities between the two scenarios.
3. **Patient Empowerment**: Measured using patient surveys and interviews.
4. **Clinical Effectiveness**: Evaluated using clinical outcome measures such as glycemic control and treatment adherence.

4. A new metric, looping inequity, to measure the divergence in health equity outcomes between scenarios with and without sustained AI-patient interaction.

### Long-Term Impact

1. **Improved Health Equity**: By modeling and mitigating bias in dynamic human-AI feedback loops, the framework has the potential to reduce health disparities and improve health equity outcomes.
