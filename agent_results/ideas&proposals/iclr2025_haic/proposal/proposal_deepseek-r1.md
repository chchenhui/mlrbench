**Research Proposal: Unraveling Long-Term Coevolution: A Framework for Mitigating Bias in Dynamic Human-AI Feedback Loops in Healthcare**  

---

### 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in healthcare are increasingly embedded in decision-making processes, from diagnosis to personalized treatment recommendations. However, these systems often operate within dynamic feedback loops: AI recommendations influence patient behavior, which in turn retrains the AI, creating a cycle that risks amplifying socio-technical biases. For instance, biased predictions in diabetes management may lead to suboptimal interventions for marginalized groups, perpetuating health disparities. Current fairness interventions, such as static bias correction in training data, fail to account for the *coevolution* of human behavior and AI models over time. This gap is critical in healthcare, where long-term patient-AI interactions can reshape clinical outcomes and trust.  

The First Workshop on Human-AI Coevolution (HAIC 2025) emphasizes understanding these bidirectional adaptations. Prior work (Smith & Johnson, 2023; Brown & Davis, 2023) highlights the risks of unmitigated feedback loops, while recent studies (Chen & Park, 2024; Zhang & Patel, 2025) stress the need for longitudinal metrics to assess equity. However, no framework exists to dynamically model, measure, and mitigate bias in such loops while preserving clinical efficacy.  

**Research Objectives**  
1. **Model** bidirectional feedback loops between AI systems and patients in healthcare using reinforcement learning (RL) and causal mediation analysis.  
2. **Develop** a bias-aware co-correction mechanism to dynamically adjust AI recommendations and patient trust.  
3. **Validate** the framework through a longitudinal case study in diabetes management, measuring disparities in glycemic control and patient empowerment.  
4. **Introduce** a novel metric, *looping inequity*, to quantify divergence in health equity outcomes under sustained AI-patient interaction.  

**Significance**  
This work bridges algorithmic fairness and participatory AI design, offering a scalable solution to mitigate bias in high-stakes healthcare applications. By addressing the coevolutionary nature of human-AI systems, it advances HAIC research and provides actionable insights for policymakers and clinicians to deploy equitable AI tools.

### 2. Methodology  

**Research Design**  
The study combines computational modeling, causal inference, and empirical validation across three phases:  

#### **Phase 1: Simulation Framework for Human-AI Feedback Loops**  
*Data Collection*:  
- **Real-World Data**: De-identified electronic health records (EHRs) from a diverse patient cohort (N=10,000) with type 2 diabetes, including demographics, treatment histories, and outcomes.  
- **Synthetic Data**: Augment EHRs using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to simulate underrepresented populations and rare scenarios.  
- **Patient Surveys**: Collect longitudinal data on trust, adherence, and perceived fairness via validated questionnaires.  

*Algorithmic Design*:  
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Setup**:  
  - **State Space**: Patient health metrics (e.g., HbA1c, BMI), socio-economic factors, and adherence history.  
  - **Action Space**: AI recommendations (e.g., medication adjustments, lifestyle interventions).  
  - **Reward Function**:  
    $$ R_t = \alpha \cdot \text{Clinical Efficacy}(s_t, a_t) + \beta \cdot \text{Fairness Penalty}(s_t, a_t) $$  
    where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ balance clinical outcomes (e.g., HbA1c reduction) and fairness (e.g., disparity in recommendations across subgroups).  
  - **Policy Optimization**: Use proximal policy optimization (PPO) to train the AI agent, incorporating periodic updates from patient feedback.  

- **Patient Behavior Model**:  
  Patients adapt to AI recommendations via a Bayesian belief update mechanism:  
  $$ P(\text{Trust}_{t+1}) = P(\text{Trust}_t) \cdot \frac{P(\text{AI Advice}_t | \text{Trust}_t)}{P(\text{AI Advice}_t)} $$  
  Trust influences adherence rates, which are fed back into the AI’s training data.  

#### **Phase 2: Bias-Aware Co-Correction Mechanism**  
- **Causal Mediation Analysis**:  
  Identify bias pathways using structural equation modeling:  
  $$ Y = \tau A + \beta M + \epsilon $$  
  where $Y$ is the health outcome, $A$ is the AI recommendation, and $M$ represents mediating variables (e.g., patient adherence, access to care). The direct effect $\tau$ and indirect effect $\beta$ quantify how biases propagate through patient behavior.  

- **Dynamic Adjustment**:  
  The AI agent adjusts its policy using a fairness-regularized loss:  
  $$ \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_\text{RL} + \lambda \cdot \text{KL}(P_\text{current} || P_\text{fair}) $$  
  where $P_\text{fair}$ is a target distribution minimizing subgroup disparities.  

- **Explainable Interventions**:  
  Patients receive personalized explanations via SHAP values, highlighting how their behavior and AI recommendations interact. Trust is recalibrated using a logistic model:  
  $$ \text{Trust}_t = \sigma\left(\gamma \cdot \text{Explanation Quality}_t + \delta \cdot \text{Outcome Satisfaction}_t\right) $$  

#### **Phase 3: Experimental Validation**  
*Case Study: Diabetes Management*  
- **Design**: 18-month longitudinal study with two arms:  
  - **Control**: Static fairness-aware AI (e.g., reweighted training data).  
  - **Intervention**: Proposed coevolution framework.  

- **Metrics**:  
  1. **Clinical Efficacy**: HbA1c reduction, hospitalization rates.  
  2. **Fairness**: Disparities in outcomes across race, income, and gender.  
  3. **Looping Inequity (LI)**:  
     $$ \text{LI} = D_{KL}(P_\text{intervention} || P_\text{counterfactual}) $$  
     where $P_\text{counterfactual}$ represents outcomes without AI-patient interaction.  
  4. **Patient Empowerment**: Survey scores on trust, autonomy, and understanding.  

*Statistical Analysis*:  
- Mixed-effects models to account for individual variability.  
- Causal forest analysis to identify heterogeneous treatment effects.

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Reduction in Health Disparities**: The co-correction framework is anticipated to reduce outcome disparities by 25–40% compared to static methods, as measured by the looping inequity metric.  
2. **Improved Patient Trust**: Explainable interventions are expected to increase patient trust scores by 30%, correlating with higher adherence rates.  
3. **Validation of Simulation Framework**: The RL-based simulator will demonstrate predictive validity in modeling long-term feedback loops, with <10% deviation from real-world observational data.  
4. **Generalizable Insights**: The framework will reveal context-specific bias pathways (e.g., socio-economic factors mediating glycemic control) applicable to other chronic diseases.  

**Impact**  
- **Clinical Practice**: Enable healthcare providers to deploy AI systems that adapt equitably to patient diversity.  
- **Policy**: Inform regulatory guidelines for evaluating AI systems in dynamic, high-stakes environments.  
- **Research**: Advance HAIC methodologies by integrating causal inference, RL, and participatory design.
