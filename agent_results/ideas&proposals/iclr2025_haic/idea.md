**Title**: **Unraveling Long-Term Coevolution: A Framework for Mitigating Bias in Dynamic Human-AI Feedback Loops in Healthcare**

**Motivation**: AI systems in healthcare increasingly shape and adapt to human behavior, creating feedback loops where AI recommendations alter patient decisions, which in turn retrain the AI. This dynamic can perpetuate or introduce socio-technical biases, particularly in high-risk populations. Current approaches focus on static fairness interventions, neglecting long-term interactions that may amplify inequities. Understanding these loops is critical to ensuring AI systems maintain fairness and efficacy as both humans and algorithms coevolve over time.

**Main Idea**: We propose a hybrid methodology (1) to model and mitigate bias in bidirectional human-AI feedback loops within healthcare. First, we design a simulation framework where AI agents trained via reinforcement learning adapt to longitudinal patient data (e.g., treatment adherence, environmental stressors) while patients adapt to AI-driven interventions (e.g., personalized treatment plans). Second, we develop a **bias-aware co-correction** mechanism: the AI dynamically tracks shifts in health disparities using causal mediation analysis to identify how patient behaviors mediate algorithmic bias, and patients receive explanations of AI-driven tradeoffs to recalibrate trust. Third, we validate the framework through a case study in diabetes management, measuring longitudinal disparities in predicted glycemic control and patient empowerment across diverse demographics. Our framework introduces a new metric, *looping inequity*, defined as the divergence in health equity outcomes between counterfactual scenarios with and without sustained AI-patient interaction. We anticipate findings showing that explicit modeling of feedback loops can reduce disparities by 25â€“40% compared to static fairness approaches, while maintaining clinical effectiveness. This work bridges algorithmic fairness with participatory AI design, offering actionable insights for deploying equitable long-term AI systems in healthcare.
