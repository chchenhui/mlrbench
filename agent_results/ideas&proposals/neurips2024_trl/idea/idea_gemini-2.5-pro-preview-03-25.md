**Title:** Dynamic Schema Graph Embeddings for Relational Database Representation

**Motivation:** Representing entire relational databases effectively remains challenging. Most methods focus on single tables or simplified schemas. Capturing complex inter-table relationships (joins, foreign keys) and attribute semantics dynamically is crucial for tasks like cross-table question answering, query optimization, and automated data integration, which current models struggle with.

**Main Idea:** Propose a novel architecture based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn dynamic representations of relational databases. We model the database schema as a graph where nodes represent tables and attributes, and edges represent primary-foreign key relationships and within-table attribute co-occurrence. Crucially, node and edge features will incorporate pre-trained embeddings (e.g., from LLMs for text attributes, specialized encoders for numerical/categorical data) representing the *content* distribution of columns/tables. The GNN will learn context-aware embeddings by propagating information across the schema graph. This approach allows representing the interaction between schema structure and data content dynamically. Expected outcomes include superior performance on cross-table reasoning tasks and improved generalization for database-level applications like automated schema matching and data discovery.
