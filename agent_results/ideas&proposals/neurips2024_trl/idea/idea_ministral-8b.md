### Title: Enhancing Tabular Data Representation Learning with Multi-Modal Fusion

### Motivation:
Tabular data, despite its ubiquity, remains under-explored in the realm of representation learning. Existing methods often fail to capture the intricate relationships and semantics present in structured data. By integrating tabular data with other modalities such as text and code, we can significantly enhance the performance of models in tasks like semantic parsing, question answering, and data preparation. This research aims to bridge the gap by developing a multi-modal fusion approach that leverages the strengths of different data types to improve the overall representation learning for tabular data.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research idea involves developing a novel multi-modal fusion architecture that combines tabular data with text and code. The architecture will consist of three main components: a tabular data encoder, a text encoder, and a code encoder. Each encoder will be trained to capture the unique characteristics of its respective data type. The encoders will then be integrated using a multi-head attention mechanism to fuse the representations. This fused representation will be used to train a joint model that can perform various tasks, such as semantic parsing and question answering, with improved accuracy and efficiency.

The methodology will include the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the tabular, textual, and code data to ensure compatibility with the encoder models.
2. **Encoder Training**: Train separate encoders for tabular data, text, and code using pre-training techniques.
3. **Multi-Modal Fusion**: Integrate the encoders using a multi-head attention mechanism to create a unified representation.
4. **Joint Model Training**: Train a joint model using the fused representation for downstream tasks.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the joint model on various tasks using benchmark datasets and metrics.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved performance in tasks that involve tabular data, such as semantic parsing and question answering.
- Enhanced ability to handle complex and heterogeneous data types.
- Development of a robust and scalable multi-modal fusion framework for tabular data representation learning.

Potential impact:
This research has the potential to revolutionize how we process and derive insights from structured data. By integrating tabular data with other modalities, we can unlock new applications and improve the efficiency of data analysis pipelines. The proposed methodology can also serve as a foundation for future research in multimodal learning and representation learning for structured data.
