**1. Title:**  
*Structure-Aware Hierarchical Transformers for Multimodal Table Representation Learning*  

**2. Motivation:**  
Tables contain complex relational hierarchies (headers, rows, columns) and heterogeneous data types, but existing models struggle to capture their nested structure and dependencies. This leads to suboptimal performance in tasks requiring deep semantic understanding (e.g., text-to-SQL, table QA). Current methods often flatten tables or use simplistic tokenization, losing critical structural context. Addressing this gap could improve applications like automated data analysis, enhance LLM capabilities for structured data, and bridge the disconnect between tabular data and multimodal systems (e.g., combining tables with text/code).  

**3. Main Idea:**  
We propose a hierarchical Transformer architecture that explicitly models table structure through:  
1. **Schema Encoder**: Captures header hierarchies and column relationships using relational embeddings.  
2. **Cell Encoder**: Integrates positional encodings for row-major/column-major order and handles mixed data types via modality-specific adapters (e.g., numeric, categorical, text).  
3. **Structure-Aware Attention**: Constrains attention to model local dependencies (e.g., row-wise coherence) and global context (cross-column relations).  

The model is pre-trained on multimodal tasks (e.g., table-text alignment, SQL generation) using contrastive learning and fine-tuned on downstream tasks. We aim to achieve state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like WikiSQL and TabMWP by explicitly modeling structural inductive biases, with potential to generalize to heterogeneous data sources (enterprise databases, scientific tables) and improve robustness to noisy tables.
