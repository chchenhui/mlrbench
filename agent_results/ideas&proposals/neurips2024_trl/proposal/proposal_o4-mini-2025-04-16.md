1. Title  
SynthTab: A Multi-Agent, Constraint-Aware LLM Framework for High-Fidelity Synthetic Tabular Data with Differential Privacy  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Tabular data remains one of the most ubiquitous and critical data modalities in enterprise, finance, healthcare, and scientific domains. Yet many real-world ML tasks face two key obstacles: (1) data scarcity due to privacy or contractual restrictions, and (2) the need to strictly respect schema constraints (data types, uniqueness, referential integrity, business rules). Traditional synthetic data generators (GAN-based or statistical estimators) often fail to capture complex dependencies or enforce rich schema constraints, leading to unrealistic or invalid samples. Meanwhile, recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation have shown promise for text and code tasks, but their full potential for tabular data synthesis remains underexplored.

Research Objectives  
This proposal presents SynthTab, a multi-agent pipeline that:  
• Leverages a fine-tuned LLM with retrieval‐augmented prompting to generate candidate rows reflecting real distributions and domain vocabularies.  
• Enforces schema compliance, referential integrity, and custom business rules via a dedicated Schema Validator agent.  
• Employs a Quality Assessor agent to compare synthetic to real data distributions and downstream model performance, providing corrective feedback.  
• Integrates differential privacy guarantees to bound information leakage.  
Our objectives are:  
1. Design an end-to-end framework for constraint-aware synthetic table generation.  
2. Quantify the trade-off between data utility, privacy, and constraint compliance.  
3. Demonstrate synthetic data effectiveness in low-data regimes across multiple domains (finance, healthcare, e-commerce).

Significance  
SynthTab addresses critical gaps in tabular data synthesis: it unifies LLM-driven generation with rigorous schema enforcement and privacy guarantees. If successful, it will enable:  
• Data augmentation for low-resource ML tasks.  
• Safe data sharing and collaboration across privacy-sensitive domains.  
• A blueprint for integrating multi-agent LLM pipelines with structured data constraints.

3. Related Work  
Several recent threads inform our design:  
• HARMONIC [Wang et al., 2024] fine-tunes LLMs with instruction data to reduce privacy risks, but does not fully enforce referential integrity.  
• TabuLa [Zhao et al., 2023] compresses token sequences for LLM training on tables, improving efficiency but omitting schema-specific rule checking.  
• Nguyen et al. [2024] introduce feature-conditional sampling and permutation strategies to capture complex correlations.  
• Xu et al. [2024] identify the need for LLMs to be permutation-aware to respect functional dependencies in tables.  
• Johnson & Williams [2023] embed schema constraints into generative models but do not leverage LLM reasoning or iterative feedback.  
• Brown & Green [2024], Lee & Kim [2024] apply GAN and constraint-aware augmentation methods to tabular data but often lack retrieval-augmented or multi-agent architectures.  
• White & Black [2024] propose multi-agent synthetic data systems, highlighting the potential of dividing generation, validation, and assessment tasks across specialized agents.  
• Adams & Brown [2024] demonstrate that retrieval-augmented generation enhances realism by consulting example rows during generation.  

SynthTab synthesizes the strengths of these approaches: retrieval-augmented LLM generation, multi-agent validation/assessment, and differential privacy.

4. Methodology  

4.1 Overview  
SynthTab consists of three interacting agents and a privacy module (Figure 1). The pipeline proceeds in rounds $t=1,\dots,T$:  
1. Row Generator Agent ($G$) proposes a batch of candidate rows given schema $\mathcal{S}$, column statistics $\Theta$, and retrieved exemplars $\mathcal{E}$.  
2. Schema Validator Agent ($V$) enforces integrity constraints by rejecting or repairing rows.  
3. Quality Assessor Agent ($Q$) measures data utility and distributional fidelity, generating corrective signals for $G$.  
4. Privacy Module applies a differential privacy mechanism ensuring the final dataset is $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP.  

4.2 Preprocessing & Retrieval Index  
• Input: Original dataset $D=\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with schema $\mathcal{S}=(C_1,\dots,C_m)$, statistics $\Theta=\{\mu_j,\sigma_j,\text{hist}_j\}$ for each column $C_j$, and a set of integrity rules $\mathcal{R}$ (data types, uniqueness, referential mappings, business logic).  
• We build a vector index of row embeddings (via a small encoder network) to support retrieval of $k$ nearest neighbor exemplars $\mathcal{E}_b$ for each generation batch $b$.  

4.3 Row Generator Agent  
We fine-tune an LLM on prompts of the form:  
“Schema: $(C_1:\text{type}_1,\dots,C_m:\text{type}_m)$; Stats: $\Theta$; Examples: \{\mathcal{E}_b\}$; Generate $b$ new rows.”  
At round $t$, $G$ outputs raw batch $\tilde{X}^{(t)}=\{\tilde{x}^{(t)}_i\}_{i=1}^b$.  

4.4 Schema Validator Agent  
For each candidate $\tilde{x}$, validate:  
• Data type conformity: value domain checks.  
• Uniqueness constraints: if $C_u$ must be unique, ensure $\tilde{x}_{C_u}\notin$ existing values.  
• Referential integrity: if $C_r$ references table $T$, ensure $\tilde{x}_{C_r}\in\pi_{key}(T)$.  
• Business rules (e.g. $C_a + C_b < 100$).  
If $\tilde{x}$ fails, $V$ attempts minimal repairs via local search (e.g. re-sampling that field with LLM prompt conditioned on other fields). If irreparable after $k_{\max}$ attempts, discard the row. Output validated $X^{(t)}$.  

4.5 Quality Assessor Agent  
Metrics:  
1. Distributional similarity: for each column $j$, compute a distance $d_j$ between empirical distributions of real $D$ and synthetic $D_s$:  
$$d_j = | \mu_j - \mu_j^s| + \lambda\, \text{Wasserstein}_1(\text{hist}_j,\text{hist}_j^s)\,$$  
2. Correlation fidelity: let $\rho_{jk}$ be Pearson correlation in $D$, and $\rho_{jk}^s$ in $D_s$. Define  
$$C_{\text{corr}} = \sum_{j<k} |\rho_{jk} - \rho_{jk}^s|.$$  
3. Downstream utility: train a classifier/regressor $f$ on $D_s$ and test on held-out real data. Compute relative performance gap $\Delta_{\text{perf}}$.  
4. Constraint-violation rate $v = \frac{\#\{\text{violations}\}}{|D_s|}$.  

The assessor computes a loss  
$$\mathcal{L}_Q = \alpha\sum_j d_j + \beta\,C_{\text{corr}} + \gamma\,\Delta_{\text{perf}} + \eta\,v$$  
and generates a corrective signal (e.g. prompt tweaks or fine-tuning gradients) to guide $G$ in next round.

4.6 Differential Privacy Mechanism  
After $T$ rounds, synthesize $D_s=\bigcup_{t=1}^T X^{(t)}$. We apply output perturbation by adding noise to numerical columns or using the exponential mechanism for categorical ones. For numerical column $j$:  
$$\tilde{C}_j = C_j + \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_j^2),\quad \sigma_j = \frac{\Delta_j\sqrt{2\ln(1.25/\delta)}}{\epsilon},$$  
where $\Delta_j$ is the sensitivity. This ensures $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP. We also adjust categorical distributions via the randomized response or the exponential mechanism, preserving $\epsilon$-DP overall.

for t in 1..T:
  E ← retrieve k exemplars for round t
  Prompt ← build_prompt(S, Θ, E)
  X̃ ← G.generate(prompt, b)
  X ← ∅
  for each row x̃ in X̃:
    if V.validate_and_repair(x̃, S, R) → x:
      X ← X ∪ {x}
  Compute metrics with Q on X ∪ previous rounds
  Compute corrective signal → update G (fine-tune or prompt adjust)

```

4.8 Experimental Design  
Datasets & Domains:  
• Public benchmarks: UCI Adult, California Housing, Kaggle Credit Fraud.  
• Domain-specific: medical prescriptions (ICD codes), financial transactions, e-commerce logs.  

Baselines: HARMONIC, TabuLa, GAN-DP [Brown & Green, 2024], Schema-Constrained GM [Johnson & Williams, 2023].  

Evaluation Protocol:  
1. Constraint compliance: measure violation rate $v$.  
2. Statistical fidelity: average $d_j$ and $C_{\text{corr}}$.  
3. Downstream task: train logistic regression or XGBoost on synthetic vs. real; compare AUC/regression RMSE.  
4. Privacy audit: membership inference attack success rate.  

We will sweep privacy budgets $\epsilon\in\{0.1,1,10\}$, rounds $T\in\{1,5,10\}$, batch sizes $b\in\{100,500\}$, and report means ± std over 5 seeds. Statistical significance will be assessed via paired t-tests at $p<0.05$.

SynthTab’s DP guarantees will facilitate cross-organizational collaboration (e.g. between hospitals or financial institutions) without exposing sensitive records.

Regulatory Compliance & Trust  
Explicit schema enforcement and privacy bounds align with GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations, promoting trust and auditability of synthetic data pipelines.

Future Research Directions  
SynthTab’s multi-agent architecture can be extended to incorporate:  
• Continual learning for evolving schemas.  
• Domain adaptation via meta-learning agents.  
• Integration with knowledge graphs to enforce richer semantic constraints.

In summary, SynthTab promises a principled, practical, and privacy-aware solution for the next generation of tabular data representation learning and synthetic data generation.
