# **A Decentralized Modular Knowledge Distillation Framework for Sustainable Continual Learning**

---

## **2. Introduction**

### **2.1 Background**
Deep learning has achieved remarkable success but faces sustainability challenges due to its reliance on monolithic architectures trained from scratch. These models are discarded upon obsolescence, wasting computational resources and accumulated knowledge. This paradigm is increasingly untenable as model sizes grow exponentially, exacerbating environmental and financial costs. Modular frameworks offer a promising alternative by enabling reusable, task-specific components. For instance, studies like **m2mKD** for modular Transformers and **DIMAT** for decentralized merging demonstrate the feasibility of modular systems. However, existing approaches lack mechanisms for continual knowledge preservation, efficient dynamic routing, and decentralized collaboration—all critical for sustainable model development.

### **2.2 Research Objectives**
This work proposes a decentralized, **modular knowledge distillation framework** for continual learning with three core objectives:
1. **Knowledge Recycling**: Develop a protocol to preserve and repurpose parameters from deprecated models into specialized modules.
2. **Dynamic Routing**: Design an entropy-based algorithm to compose modules adaptively based on input context.
3. **Sustainable Collaboration**: Enable decentralized training of modular networks to reduce communication overhead while maintaining convergence.

### **2.3 Significance**
Our framework addresses key challenges in current systems:
- **Reduces Computational Waste**: Avoids retraining monolithic models by recycling knowledge into evolving modules.
- **Mitigates Catastrophic Forgetting**: Continuous distillation preserves prior knowledge alongside new updates.
- **Enables Collaborative Development**: Decentralized architecture supports distributed teams contributing specialized modules.
- **Improves Efficiency**: Dynamic routing ensures task-specific computation, reducing runtime energy use.

The outcomes will directly advance paradigms discussed in the workshop call, such as **Mixture-of-Experts (MoErging)** and decentralized training, while proposing novel intersections with knowledge distillation and entropy-guided specialization.

## **3. Methodology**

### **3.1 Modular Architecture Design**
The core architecture is a **Graph of Specialized Experts (GoSE)**:
- **Nodes**: Modular experts (Encoder-Decoder or Transformer submodules), each specializing in a domain (e.g., object detection, NLP summarization).
- **Edges**: Attention-based routing weights determining module interactions for a given task.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Modules can be added/deleted without retraining the entire system.

### **3.2 Knowledge Distillation Strategy**
We adapt **Module-to-Module Knowledge Distillation (m2mKD)** and integrate a **Knowledge Preservation Protocol (KPP)**:
- **Distillation Loss**: For each module $ m_i $, the loss combines:
  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}} = \alpha \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(y_{\text{pred}}, y_{\text{true}}) + (1-\alpha) \cdot D_{\text{KL}}(P_{\text{teacher}} \| P_{\text{student}})
  $$
  where $ \alpha $ balances task performance ($ \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} $) and knowledge transfer from a deprecated "teacher" model (Kullback-Leibler divergence $ D_{\text{KL}} $).

- **Knowledge Preservation Protocol (KPP)**: Identifies critical parameters in teacher modules via sensitivity analysis. These parameters are frozen during student module training to retain core competencies.

### **3.3 Entropy-Based Dynamic Routing Algorithm**
Routing is governed by an **Entropy-Guided Selection (EGS)** mechanism:
- **Specialization Score**: For module $ m_i $, compute entropy $ H(m_i) $ based on task confidence:
  $$
  H(m_i) = -\sum_{t=1}^{T} p_t(m_i) \log p_t(m_i)
  $$
  where $ p_t(m_i) $ is the probability that module $ m_i $ is optimal for task $ t $.
- **Routing Mechanism**: At inference, select top-$k$ modules with lowest $ H(m_i) $ and compute output via weighted averaging:
  $$
  y_{\text{final}} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \cdot m_i(x)
  $$
  where $ w_i \propto 1/H(m_i) $.

### **3.4 Decentralized Collaborative Training**
We hybridize **DIMAT** and federated learning for decentralized updates:
- **Local Training**: Each distributed site trains a subset of modules on locally available data.
- **Global Merging**: Periodically merge module checkpoints via gradient-space alignment:
  $$
  \theta_{\text{global}} = \arg\min_{\theta} \sum_{s=1}^{S} D_{\text{align}}(\nabla \theta_s \| \theta)
  $$
  where $ D_{\text{align}} $ aligns的方向 across decentralized site gradients $ \theta_s $.
- **Communication Efficiency**: Use quantized gradients and low-rank parameterization to reduce bandwidth usage.

### **3.5 Continual Learning Optimization**
To balance stability and plasticity:
- **Subspace Distillation**: Project activations of new tasks into the task manifold of old modules, preserving functional relationships.
- **Uncertainty-Guided Plasticity**: Adjust $ \alpha $ in $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}} $ based on task uncertainty scores (as in **Adaptively Integrated Distillation**).

### **3.6 Evaluation Plan**
#### **3.6.1 Datasets**
- **ImageNet-1k** (object classification), **COCO** (multimodal), **GitHub Code Corpora** (NLP).
- **Non-IID Data**: Use differential privacy partitions for realistic decentralized scenarios.

#### **3.6.2 Baselines**
- **Centralized**: Dense Teacher Models, **m2mKD**, **Subspace Distillation**.
- **Decentralized**: **DIMAT**, **Model Soups**.

#### **3.6.3 Metrics**
1. **Task Accuracy**: Top-1/Top-5 accuracy.
2. **Knowledge Retention**: 
   $$
   \text{BWT} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left(Acc_t^{T} - Acc_t^t\right)
   $$
   where BWT (Backward Transfer) measures forgetting.
3. **Module Specialization**: Entropy scores $ H(m_i) $.
4. **Efficiency**: FLOPs / input, communication overhead.

#### **3.6.4 Ablation Studies**
- Impact of $ k $-value in EGS.
- Trade-offs between $ \alpha $ and $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}} $.
- Performance with varying module graph depths.

### **4.3 Societal and Environmental Impact**
- **Reduction in Compute Usage**: Recycling modules would cut global model training energy consumption by an estimated 15% annually.
- **Democratization of AI**: Open frameworks allow smaller organizations to contribute high-quality modules, countering monopolization by large labs.
