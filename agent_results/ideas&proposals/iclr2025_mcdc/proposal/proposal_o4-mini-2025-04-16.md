1. Title  
Decentralized Modular Knowledge Distillation for Sustainable Continual Learning  

2. Introduction  
2.1 Background  
The deep learning community has largely followed a “bigger is better” paradigm, driving success through ever-larger monolithic models. While this scaling trend delivers state-of-the-art performance in many domains, it comes with mounting costs: enormous computational and storage requirements, high energy consumption, and a lack of flexibility for incremental updates. Moreover, monolithic models discard earlier checkpoints and learned knowledge when new models are trained from scratch, leading to wasted resources and hindering continual improvement.

In contrast, software engineering and biological systems exhibit modularity: reusable components that can be independently maintained, updated, or recombined. In software, modules encapsulate functionality and ease maintenance; in biology, specialized subsystems adapt to changing environments. Bringing this principle to deep learning promises multiple benefits: resource reuse, mitigation of catastrophic forgetting, efficient collaboration across teams, and sustainable model evolution.

2.2 Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to design, implement, and evaluate a decentralized framework—Decentralized Modular Knowledge Distillation (DMKD)—that:  
  • Distills knowledge from large, deprecated monolithic models into a library of smaller, specialized modules (“experts”).  
  • Employs a knowledge preservation protocol to extract and transfer valuable parameters from legacy checkpoints into new modules.  
  • Utilizes an entropy-based metric to quantify module specialization and drive a dynamic routing mechanism for inference.  
  • Enables continual learning in a decentralized setting, where modules are collaboratively trained, merged, and updated without central coordination.

2.3 Significance  
Achieving these objectives will:  
  • Drastically reduce training cost and carbon footprint by reusing modules.  
  • Mitigate catastrophic forgetting through modular specialization.  
  • Allow multiple parties to contribute expert modules in a communication-efficient manner.  
  • Lay the groundwork for sustainable, extendable deep learning ecosystems, and expedite domain-specific applications (e.g., vision, NLP).  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Framework Overview  
Our DMKD framework consists of three interacting components:  
  1. Module Library: A repository of expert modules, each trained or distilled on a specific domain or subtask.  
  2. Knowledge Preservation Protocol: A set of procedures to mine parameters from deprecated large models and map them into existing or new modules.  
  3. Dynamic Routing & Decentralized Training: A gating network that selects and composes modules at inference and supports collaborative, communication-efficient updates.

3.2 Module Construction and Knowledge Preservation  
Given a deprecated monolithic model $M_{\text{old}}$ with parameters $W_{\text{old}}$, we identify sub-networks or parameter subsets that encode distinct capabilities. Our protocol uses three steps:  
  1. Importance Scoring: Compute, for each layer parameter matrix $W_{\text{old}}^{(l)}$, an importance score $s_{i,j} = |W_{\text{old},i,j}^{(l)}|\cdot \|\nabla_{i,j}\mathcal{L}\|$ averaged over a small calibration dataset.  
  2. Module Assignment: Partition $W_{\text{old}}^{(l)}$ into $K$ clusters via spectral clustering on the importance-weighted adjacency matrix, creating candidate modules $\{M_k\}$.  
  3. Transfer & Fine-Tuning: For each cluster $k$, initialize a new expert module with parameters  
     $$W_k^{(0)} = \alpha\,W_{\text{old},k} + (1-\alpha)\,W_{\text{rand},k},$$  
     where $W_{\text{rand},k}$ is random initialization, and $\alpha\in[0,1]$ controls reliance on legacy weights. Fine-tune each $W_k$ on module-specific data via knowledge distillation (KD) loss:  
     $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{KD}} = \sum_{x\in \mathcal{D}_k} D_{\mathrm{KL}}\big(p_{\text{old}}(x)\,\|\,p_{k}(x)\big)\,. $$  

3.3 Entropy-Based Specialization Metric and Routing  
We quantify each module’s specialization via an entropy measure. Let $p_{k}(y\mid x)$ be the softmax output of module $M_k$ on input $x$, and assume a calibration set $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$. Define  
  $$H_k = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{y} p_{k}(y\mid x_i)\log p_{k}(y\mid x_i)\,. $$  
Lower entropy $H_k$ indicates that $M_k$ is confident (specialized) on its domain, while higher $H_k$ suggests generality. We then maintain a gating network $G_\theta$ that, for a new input $x$, computes routing logits  
  $$z_k(x) = G_\theta(M_k,\,x)\,,\quad p_k(x)=\mathrm{softmax}_k\big(\beta\,(-H_k)+z_k(x)\big),$$  
where $\beta$ balances static specialization ($-H_k$) and dynamic relevance ($z_k(x)$). We choose top-$R$ modules by $p_k(x)$ and aggregate their outputs via weighted sum:  
  $$y_{\mathrm{pred}} = \sum_{k\in \mathcal{S}_R(x)} p_k(x)\,M_k(x)\,. $$

3.4 Decentralized Training and Module Merging  
To enable collaborative module updates across $N$ nodes with non-IID data, we adopt a variant of DIMAT (Saadati et al., 2024). Each node $n$ holds a local subset of modules and training data. Training proceeds in rounds $t=1,\dots,T$:  
  1. Local Update: Node $n$ fine-tunes its assigned modules $\{M_k\}$ via local data, minimizing  
     $$\mathcal{L}_n = \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{task}} + \lambda\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{KD}}\,. $$  
  2. Communication & Merge: Periodically (every $\tau$ rounds), nodes share module parameters. For module $k$, the global update is  
     $$W_k^{(t+1)} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}_k|}\sum_{n\in \mathcal{N}_k} W_{k,n}^{(t)},$$  
     where $\mathcal{N}_k$ is the set of nodes holding $M_k$.  

To reduce communication, we compress updates via low-rank approximation. For each update $\Delta W_{k,n}$, we compute a rank-$r$ SVD:  
  $$\Delta W_{k,n}\approx U_r\Sigma_rV_r^\top$$  
and transmit only $(U_r,\Sigma_r,V_r)$.
