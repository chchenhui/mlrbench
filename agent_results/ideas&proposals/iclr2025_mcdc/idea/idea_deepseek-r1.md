**Title:** Decentralized Federated Mixture-of-Experts for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Learning  

**Motivation:** Current federated learning (FL) frameworks rely on monolithic models, which suffer from high communication costs and struggle with heterogeneous client data. Modular, decentralized training of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) could address these issues by enabling clients to specialize in distinct sub-tasks while sharing only critical components, reducing overhead and improving adaptability.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a federated MoE framework where clients locally train sparse, specialized experts on their private data. A global gating router dynamically selects and aggregates relevant experts during inference. Key innovations include:  
1. **Sparse Expert Updates:** Clients transmit only active expert parameters (not the full model) to a central server, minimizing communication.  
2. **Router Consensus:** The global router is updated via secure aggregation of client-specific gating preferences, ensuring compatibility with diverse data distributions.  
3. **Expert Recycling:** Pre-trained models from clients are reused as "frozen" experts, reducing redundant training.  

Expected outcomes include a 50-70% reduction in communication costs compared to standard FL, improved performance on non-IID data, and seamless integration of new experts for continual learning. This approach could democratize collaborative AI by enabling institutions to pool modular capabilities without sharing raw data, accelerating sustainable model development.
