# Deep Learning Landscape Topology: Understanding the Edge of Stability Phenomenon

## Motivation
The Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon challenges classical optimization theory as deep neural networks continue training with large learning rates despite negative curvature and instability. This disconnect between theory and practice creates a significant barrier to developing principled approaches for efficiently training large models. Understanding the landscape topology around EoS regions could help develop optimization algorithms that safely navigate these boundaries, potentially reducing computational costs for large model training by orders of magnitude.

## Main Idea
I propose a geometric analysis framework that characterizes the topological properties of loss landscapes in the Edge of Stability regime. By combining differential geometry and stochastic process theory, we can model how gradient trajectories navigate saddle-point-rich regions while maintaining progress toward generalization. The approach involves developing metrics to quantify the "escape velocity" from high-curvature regions and the "stability radius" around training trajectories. Using these metrics, we can derive modified optimizer dynamics that explicitly account for landscape curvature transitions, allowing models to safely navigate EoS boundaries while maintaining convergence guarantees. This research would yield both theoretical insights about why large learning rates work in practice and practical algorithms that automatically adapt to landscape topology, potentially reducing training time for large models by 30-50%.
