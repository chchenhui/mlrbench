# Dynamical Insights into Edge of Stability Optimization for Large-Scale Deep Learning

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various domains, but the process remains largely empirical, requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning and trial-and-error methods. The classical machine learning theory often fails to explain the phenomena observed in deep learning, particularly the success of optimization methods despite large learning rates and gradient noise. The Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon, where training hovers near an unstable regime while minimizing loss, is a crucial aspect of modern deep learning practice. However, this phenomenon is not well understood, leading to inefficient training processes for large-scale models.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a theoretical framework that characterizes the EoS regime via continuous approximations of gradient dynamics, such as stochastic differential equations (SDEs). By analyzing how oscillations and stability boundaries interact with non-convex landscapes, we aim to design an adaptive optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts learning rates and noise schedules to operate at EoS without diverging. This algorithm will incorporate curvature estimates from low-cost Hessian approximations to modulate updates, enabling stable convergence with accelerated training.

### Significance

This research is significant because it bridges the gap between deep learning theory and practice. By providing a principled approach to training large-scale models, it can drastically reduce computational costs, energy consumption, and time requirements. The expected outcomes include improved convergence guarantees for modern architectures and practical implementations that demonstrate significant speedups in training large-scale models.

## 2. Methodology

### Research Design

#### Data Collection

The data collection phase will involve training various deep learning models, such as vision and language models, using different optimization algorithms and learning rates. The collected data will include training loss trajectories, gradient noise, and model parameters over time.

#### Algorithmic Steps

The research will involve the following algorithmic steps:

1. **Gradient Dynamics Approximation**:
   - Use continuous approximations of gradient dynamics, such as SDEs, to model the training process.
   - Approximate the discrete-time gradient dynamics with a continuous counterpart, e.g., gradient flow or SDE.

2. **EoS Analysis**:
   - Analyze how oscillations and stability boundaries interact with non-convex landscapes.
   - Characterize the EoS regime by studying the behavior of the maximum eigenvalue of the training loss Hessian.

3. **Adaptive Optimization Algorithm**:
   - Design an adaptive optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts learning rates and noise schedules to operate at EoS.
   - Incorporate curvature estimates from low-cost Hessian approximations to modulate updates.

4. **Validation and Evaluation**:
   - Validate the algorithm using various datasets and model architectures.
   - Evaluate the performance using convergence metrics and computational efficiency.

#### Mathematical Formulations

The continuous-time approximation of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) process can be modeled using SDEs. Let $\theta(t)$ denote the model parameters at time $t$, and let $L(\theta)$ be the loss function. The SDE for the SGD process can be written as:

\[ d\theta(t) = -\eta \nabla L(\theta(t)) \, dt + \sigma \, dW(t), \]

where $\eta$ is the learning rate, $\sigma$ is the noise level, and $W(t)$ is a standard Wiener process.

The maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix, $\lambda_{\max}(\nabla^2 L(\theta))$, is a critical factor in the EoS analysis. The EoS regime is characterized by $\lambda_{\max} \approx \frac{2}{\eta}$, where $\eta$ is the learning rate.

#### Experimental Design

The experimental design will involve the following steps:

1. **Baseline Algorithms**:
   - Train models using standard optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD, Adam) with various learning rates and noise levels.

2. **Proposed Algorithm**:
   - Implement and train models using the proposed adaptive optimization algorithm.

3. **Comparison Metrics**:
   - Evaluate the performance using convergence metrics (e.g., training loss, validation accuracy) and computational efficiency (e.g., training time, wall-clock time).

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Perform statistical analysis to compare the performance of the baseline and proposed algorithms.
