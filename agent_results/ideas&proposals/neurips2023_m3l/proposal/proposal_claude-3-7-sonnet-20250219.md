# Dynamical Insights into Edge of Stability Optimization for Large-Scale Deep Learning

## 1. Introduction

Deep learning has revolutionized artificial intelligence with remarkable success across domains ranging from computer vision to natural language processing. Despite these achievements, the practice of training deep neural networks remains largely empirical, with researchers and practitioners relying on heuristics, rules of thumb, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. This disconnect between theory and practice becomes increasingly problematic in the era of foundation models with billions or trillions of parameters, where trial-and-error approaches incur enormous computational and environmental costs.

A particularly intriguing phenomenon observed in modern deep learning is the "Edge of Stability" (EoS), first formally characterized by Cohen et al. (2021). This phenomenon describes how gradient-based optimization often operates in a regime where the maximum eigenvalue of the training loss Hessian hovers just above $2/\eta$, where $\eta$ is the learning rate. In this regime, the training exhibits a non-monotonic behavior in the short term while consistently decreasing over longer timescales. This contradicts classical optimization theory, which typically assumes convexity and strict stability conditions.

The EoS phenomenon represents a significant gap between theoretical understanding and practical deep learning. Traditional convergence analyses assume that the learning rate is small enough to ensure monotonic loss decrease, yet practitioners routinely use large learning rates that violate these assumptions and still achieve excellent performance. Understanding the dynamics of optimization at the EoS could potentially lead to more efficient training algorithms, reducing the computational burden of training large-scale models.

This research proposes to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding and leveraging the EoS phenomenon in deep learning optimization. We aim to bridge the gap between optimization theory and practice by deriving continuous-time approximations of the discrete optimization dynamics that explicitly account for curvature and noise characteristics unique to deep neural networks. Building on this theoretical foundation, we will design a novel adaptive optimization algorithm that dynamically operates at the EoS without diverging, enabling faster and more efficient training of large-scale models.

The significance of this research is threefold. First, it addresses a fundamental theoretical question in deep learning optimization, potentially resolving a key disconnect between theory and practice. Second, it offers practical benefits in the form of more efficient training algorithms, which could substantially reduce the computational resources required for training large models. Third, the insights gained may inform better architectural choices and initialization strategies that are intrinsically more amenable to efficient optimization.

## 2. Methodology

Our methodology combines theoretical analysis, algorithm development, and empirical validation to understand and leverage the Edge of Stability phenomenon in deep learning optimization.

### 2.1 Continuous-Time Approximation of Training Dynamics

We begin by developing continuous-time approximations of the discrete optimization process used in deep learning. While previous work has explored gradient flow and stochastic differential equations (SDEs) as approximations, these approaches often fail to capture the complex dynamics observed at the EoS.

We propose to model the dynamics of parameter updates $\theta_t$ during training using the following SDE framework:

$$d\theta_t = -\nabla f(\theta_t)dt + g(\theta_t, \lambda(t))dt + \sigma(\theta_t)dW_t$$

where:
- $f(\theta_t)$ is the loss function
- $g(\theta_t, \lambda(t))$ is a curvature-dependent correction term
- $\lambda(t)$ represents the spectral properties of the Hessian (particularly the maximum eigenvalue)
- $\sigma(\theta_t)$ characterizes the gradient noise covariance
- $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process

The crucial innovation in our approach is the explicit modeling of the interaction between curvature (through $\lambda(t)$) and the parameter updates. We hypothesize that the EoS phenomenon emerges from a dynamic equilibrium between gradient-driven optimization and curvature-induced instability.

To capture the spectral dynamics at EoS, we further propose to model the evolution of the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian:

$$d\lambda(t) = h(\theta_t, \lambda(t))dt + \xi(\theta_t)dB_t$$

where $h$ describes the deterministic evolution of the maximum eigenvalue and $\xi$ captures the stochastic fluctuations in the spectrum, with $B_t$ being another Wiener process.

### 2.2 Analysis of Stability Boundaries and Oscillatory Behavior

Building on the continuous-time model, we will analyze the stability boundaries of the system. At the EoS, we expect to find:

$$\lambda(t) \approx \frac{2}{\eta} + \epsilon(t)$$

where $\eta$ is the learning rate and $\epsilon(t)$ is a small fluctuation term.

We will characterize the oscillatory behavior around this boundary by examining the local dynamics:

$$d\theta_t^i \approx -\left(1 - \frac{\eta\lambda(t)}{2}\right)\nabla_i f(\theta_t)dt + \text{higher-order terms} + \text{noise terms}$$

where $\theta_t^i$ represents the component of $\theta_t$ along the eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue.

This analysis will provide insights into:
1. The conditions under which training remains stable despite operating at the edge of the theoretical stability boundary
2. The mechanism by which oscillations around the EoS contribute to escaping poor local minima
3. The implicit regularization effect of these oscillations on the learned parameters

### 2.3 Development of EoS-Aware Optimization Algorithm

Based on our theoretical insights, we will develop an EoS-aware optimization algorithm called Edge-Adaptive Gradient Descent (EAGD). The algorithm will dynamically adjust learning rates and momentum parameters based on estimates of the local curvature to maintain operation at the EoS while preventing divergence.

The update rule for EAGD will take the form:

$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta_t \left(m_t + \beta_t c_t \right)$$

where:
- $m_t$ is a momentum-corrected gradient estimate
- $c_t$ is a curvature-based correction term
- $\eta_t$ is an adaptive learning rate
- $\beta_t$ is an adaptive coefficient controlling the influence of curvature

The curvature term $c_t$ will be computed using efficient Hessian-vector product approximations:

$$c_t = \mathcal{H}_t v_t$$

where $\mathcal{H}_t$ is the Hessian (or an approximation) at step $t$, and $v_t$ is the principal eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue.

To maintain efficiency, we will use the Lanczos algorithm to estimate the maximum eigenvalue $\lambda_{\text{max}}(\mathcal{H}_t)$ and its corresponding eigenvector without explicitly forming the full Hessian. The adaptive learning rate $\eta_t$ will be adjusted according to:

$$\eta_t = \frac{\alpha}{1 + \delta \max(0, \lambda_{\text{max}}(\mathcal{H}_t) - \lambda_{\text{target}})}$$

where $\alpha$ is a base learning rate, $\delta$ is a damping factor, and $\lambda_{\text{target}}$ is slightly below $2/\alpha$ to maintain operation near the EoS while preventing instability.

### 2.4 Implementation Details and Computational Efficiency

The practical implementation of EAGD will focus on computational efficiency to ensure applicability to large-scale models. We will:

1. Use randomized algorithms for Hessian-vector products
2. Perform curvature estimation at a reduced frequency (e.g., every k steps)
3. Implement adaptive precision for curvature computations based on the current stage of training
4. Employ distributed computation strategies for Lanczos iterations in large models

The computational overhead of our method will be controlled to ensure that the benefits of faster convergence outweigh the additional cost of curvature estimation.

### 2.5 Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics
