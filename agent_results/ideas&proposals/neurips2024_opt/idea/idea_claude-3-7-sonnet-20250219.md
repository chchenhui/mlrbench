# Adaptive Learning Rate Scaling Laws for Large Language Models

## Motivation
Training large language models is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and has significant environmental impacts. Current approaches often rely on heuristic learning rate schedules that don't systematically account for model size, leading to inefficient training processes when scaling to larger models. This research addresses the critical need to establish principled relationships between model size and optimal learning rate schedules, potentially saving millions in compute costs and reducing carbon emissions from AI training.

## Main Idea
We propose developing theoretical and empirical scaling laws that precisely determine optimal learning rate schedules as functions of model parameters (N) and dataset size. Our approach combines three key innovations: (1) A mathematical framework that establishes model size-dependent learning rate functions of the form lr(N) = α·N^β, where α and β are derived from model architecture characteristics; (2) A transfer learning methodology that extrapolates optimal learning dynamics from smaller models to larger ones with minimal additional computation; and (3) An adaptive algorithm that automatically adjusts learning rates during training based on observed convergence patterns. By implementing these scaling laws in popular optimization frameworks, we expect to reduce training time of billion-parameter models by 30-40% while maintaining or improving final model performance, effectively democratizing access to large-scale AI by making it more computationally efficient.
