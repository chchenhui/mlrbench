### Title: "Model Size-Dependent Learning Rates for Efficient Large Language Model Fine-Tuning"

### Motivation
The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant advancements in AI but also presents challenges in optimization. Fine-tuning LLMs for specific tasks is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This research aims to address the inefficiency of current fine-tuning methods by proposing model size-dependent learning rates that enable extrapolation from smaller models to large ones. This approach can save substantial time and resources, reducing the environmental impact of AI training.

### Main Idea
The proposed research focuses on developing a novel adaptive learning rate strategy that scales with the size of the model. The main idea is to identify natural model size-dependent learning rates that facilitate efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. The methodology involves:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a diverse dataset of LLMs of varying sizes and their corresponding training dynamics.
2. **Model Analysis**: Analyzing the relationship between model size and learning rates using statistical and machine learning techniques.
3. **Algorithm Development**: Designing an adaptive learning rate algorithm that adjusts dynamically based on the model size.
4. **Empirical Validation**: Evaluating the proposed method through extensive experiments on various LLM architectures and tasks.

Expected outcomes include a significant reduction in fine-tuning time and computational resources, enabling faster and more efficient LLM training. The potential impact includes substantial savings in both time and monetary costs, as well as reduced environmental impact due to decreased energy consumption. This research will also contribute to the broader understanding of scaling laws in optimization relevant to machine learning.
