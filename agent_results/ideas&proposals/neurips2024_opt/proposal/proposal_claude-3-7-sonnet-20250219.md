# Optimization-Aware Scaling Laws for Efficient Hyperparameter Transfer in Large Model Training

## 1. Introduction

The rapid advancement of machine learning, particularly with the emergence of large language models (LLMs), has created unprecedented challenges in optimization strategies. While these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, their training requires enormous computational resources, with associated financial costs reaching millions of dollars and significant environmental impact due to energy consumption. Current approaches to scaling models often rely on trial-and-error methods for hyperparameter tuning, resulting in inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal model performance.

Recent research has established scaling laws that describe how model performance relates to model size and dataset size (Kaplan et al., 2023). However, these laws typically neglect a critical factor: the dynamics of the optimization process itself. The choice of optimization algorithm and its hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, momentum, etc.) significantly influences training efficiency and model performance, yet how these parameters should scale with model size remains poorly understood.

This research proposal addresses this critical gap by introducing the concept of "optimization-aware scaling laws" â€“ a framework that explicitly models the relationships between optimizer hyperparameters, model architecture, and optimization algorithm characteristics. The fundamental research question we seek to answer is: How do optimal hyperparameters scale with model dimensions and optimizer properties, and can we derive predictive laws to guide hyperparameter selection for large-scale models?

The significance of this research is multifaceted. First, it aims to reduce the computational burden of hyperparameter tuning for large models by enabling efficient transfer of optimal configurations from smaller, less resource-intensive models. Second, it promotes more environmentally sustainable AI development by minimizing wasteful computational experiments. Third, it advances our theoretical understanding of optimization dynamics in deep learning, potentially leading to new optimization methods specifically designed for large-scale models. Finally, it democratizes access to large model training by reducing the resources needed for effective hyperparameter optimization, enabling broader participation in cutting-edge AI research.

## 2. Methodology

Our research methodology comprises four main phases: (1) systematic experimentation across model scales, (2) derivation of optimization-aware scaling laws, (3) development of a hyperparameter recommendation framework, and (4) validation on large language model training and fine-tuning tasks.

### 2.1 Systematic Experimentation

We will conduct controlled experiments across a spectrum of model sizes, architectures, and optimization algorithms to collect empirical data on how optimal hyperparameters vary with scale.

**Model Architectures and Scales**:
- Transformer-based models with parameter counts ranging from 10M to 10B
- Varying widths (hidden dimension sizes) and depths (number of layers)
- Different attention mechanisms (standard, multi-query, grouped-query, etc.)

**Optimization Algorithms**:
- First-order methods: SGD, Adam, AdamW, Lion, Adafactor
- Second-order approximations: Shampoo, K-FAC
- Decoupled methods: AdaBelief, AdaMomentum

**Hyperparameters to Study**:
- Learning rate ($\eta$)
- Batch size ($B$)
- Momentum coefficients ($\beta_1, \beta_2$)
- Weight decay ($\lambda$)
- Learning rate schedule parameters (warmup steps, decay rates)

For each combination of model architecture and optimizer, we will identify the optimal hyperparameter configuration through controlled grid searches, using validation loss as the primary metric. To manage computational costs, we will employ a multi-fidelity approach, conducting more exhaustive searches on smaller models and progressively more selective searches on larger models, guided by emerging patterns.

### 2.2 Derivation of Scaling Laws

Based on the experimental data, we will derive mathematical relationships that describe how optimal hyperparameters scale with model dimensions. We hypothesize that these relationships follow power-law scaling similar to those observed in performance scaling laws.

For learning rates, we propose a general scaling law of the form:

$$\eta_{\text{opt}}(n, d, o) = C_\eta \cdot n^{\alpha_n} \cdot d^{\alpha_d} \cdot f_o(o)$$

where:
- $n$ is the number of parameters in the model
- $d$ is the dimensionality of the model (e.g., hidden size)
- $o$ represents optimizer-specific parameters
- $C_\eta$ is a constant
- $\alpha_n, \alpha_d$ are scaling exponents
- $f_o(o)$ is an optimizer-specific scaling function

Similarly, for batch size:

$$B_{\text{opt}}(n, d, o) = C_B \cdot n^{\beta_n} \cdot d^{\beta_d} \cdot g_o(o)$$

For momentum parameters:

$$\beta_{1,\text{opt}}(n, d, o) = 1 - C_{\beta_1} \cdot n^{\gamma_n} \cdot d^{\gamma_d} \cdot h_o(o)$$

We will employ regression techniques to estimate the scaling exponents and coefficients from our experimental data. Additionally, we will develop theoretical justifications for the observed scaling relationships by analyzing the dynamics of optimization algorithms in high-dimensional spaces.

### 2.3 Hyperparameter Recommendation Framework

Based on the derived scaling laws, we will develop a lightweight hyperparameter recommendation framework that:

1. Takes as input:
   - Target model architecture specifications (parameter count, dimensions)
   - Chosen optimization algorithm
   - Optional: Performance data from smaller model training runs

2. Outputs recommended hyperparameter configurations for the target model, including:
   - Initial learning rate
   - Learning rate schedule
   - Batch size
   - Momentum parameters
   - Weight decay

The framework will incorporate both the derived scaling laws and uncertainty quantification to provide confidence intervals for the recommendations. It will be implemented as an open-source Python library with integrations for popular deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, JAX).

The recommendation algorithm will work as follows:

1. **Baseline Establishment**: Given a small model ($M_s$) with known optimal hyperparameters ($H_s$), and a target larger model ($M_t$):

2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from both models:
   ```
   F_s = extract_features(M_s)  # e.g., parameter count, dimensionality, depth
   F_t = extract_features(M_t)
   ```

3. **Scaling Prediction**: Apply scaling laws to predict target hyperparameters:
   ```
   H_t = scale_hyperparameters(H_s, F_s, F_t, optimizer_type)
   ```

4. **Uncertainty Estimation**: Provide confidence intervals based on prediction uncertainty:
   ```
   H_t_ranges = compute_confidence_intervals(H_t, prediction_uncertainty)
   ```

### 2.4 Validation Experiments

We will validate the effectiveness of our hyperparameter recommendation framework through comprehensive experiments on model training and fine-tuning tasks.

**Validation Tasks**:
1. **Pretraining**: Language modeling on a corpus of diverse text data
2. **Fine-tuning**: Instruction tuning and alignment of pretrained models
3. **Transfer Learning**: Adaptation to domain-specific tasks

**Evaluation Metrics**:
1. **Effectiveness Metrics**:
   - Final validation loss/perplexity
   - Task-specific performance metrics (accuracy, F1, etc.)
   - Convergence speed (number of iterations to reach target performance)

2. **Efficiency Metrics**:
   - Computational cost relative to baseline methods (FLOPs)
   - Wall-clock time savings
   - Energy consumption reduction

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Performance vs. Bayesian optimization baseline
   - Performance vs. manual hyperparameter tuning
   - Performance vs. fixed hyperparameter schedules

For each validation task, we will compare our approach against several baselines:
1. **Random Search**: Traditional random hyperparameter search
2. **Bayesian Optimization**: Using BoTorch/Ax
3. **LLM-guided Optimization**: Using LLMs to suggest hyperparameters
4. **Manual Tuning**: Expert-designed hyperparameter schedules
5. **Constant Transfer**: Direct transfer of hyperparameters without scaling

**Experimental Protocol**:
1. For each model size (Small: 100M, Medium: 1B, Large: 10B parameters):
   a. Perform exhaustive hyperparameter search on the smallest model
   b. Use our scaling laws to predict optimal hyperparameters for larger models
   c. Compare predicted hyperparameters against baselines
   d. Measure performance and computational efficiency

2. For fine-tuning experiments:
   a. Start with pretrained models of varying sizes
   b. Apply our scaling laws to determine fine-tuning hyperparameters
   c. Compare against standard fine-tuning approaches
   d. Evaluate both performance and computational cost

### 2.5 Implementation Details

We will implement our experiments using PyTorch and JAX, with distributed training supported by frameworks such as DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and JAX's pmap/pjit. For hyperparameter optimization baselines, we will use Ray Tune and Ax.

The mathematical modeling and regression analysis will be implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn. For uncertainty quantification, we will employ Bayesian regression techniques implemented in PyMC3 or Stan.

Our validation experiments will be conducted on a cluster equipped with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, with smaller-scale experiments performed on V100 GPUs. To ensure reproducibility, we will fix random seeds, standardize evaluation protocols, and open-source all code and experimental configurations.
