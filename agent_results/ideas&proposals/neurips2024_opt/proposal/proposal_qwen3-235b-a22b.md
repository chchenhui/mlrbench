# Optimization-Aware Scaling Laws for Efficient Hyperparameter Transfer in Large Model Training  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has fundamentally transformed the landscape of machine learning optimization. Traditional scaling laws—empirical or theoretical relationships that predict model performance as a function of model size, dataset size, and compute resources—have primarily focused on architectural and data-driven factors. However, these laws often neglect the critical role of optimization algorithms and their hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, momentum terms). This omission creates a significant gap: hyperparameter tuning for large models remains a costly, trial-and-error process, with suboptimal configurations leading to wasted computational resources, prolonged training times, and increased environmental impact.  

Recent studies have begun to address hyperparameter scaling. For instance, Opt-Laws (Xie et al., 2024) model hyperparameter dynamics using stochastic differential equations, while Li et al. (2025) identify power-law relationships between learning rates and model parameters. However, these works focus on isolated aspects (e.g., learning rate schedules) and lack a unified framework that integrates optimizer choice, hyperparameter interactions, and model scaling. This proposal aims to bridge this gap by deriving *optimization-aware scaling laws*—generalizable rules that explicitly model how optimizer hyperparameters should adapt as models scale.  

### Research Objectives  
This research seeks to:  
1. **Derive scaling laws** that quantify how optimal optimizer hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, momentum) vary with model size, architecture, and optimizer class (e.g., Adam vs. SGD).  
2. **Develop a lightweight framework** for hyperparameter transfer, enabling practitioners to extrapolate configurations from small-scale experiments to large models.  
3. **Validate the framework** on LLM fine-tuning tasks, demonstrating reduced compute costs and improved convergence compared to baseline methods.  

### Significance  
By integrating optimization dynamics into scaling laws, this work will:  
- **Reduce hyperparameter search costs** by orders of magnitude, enabling compute-optimal model scaling.  
- **Democratize access to LLM training** by lowering barriers for resource-constrained researchers.  
- **Mitigate environmental impact** through energy-efficient training protocols.  
- **Advance theoretical understanding** of optimization-algorithm interactions in nonconvex, high-dimensional spaces.

## 2. Methodology  

### Research Design  
The methodology consists of four phases: (1) systematic experimentation to map hyperparameter sensitivity across model sizes, (2) regression analysis to derive scaling laws, (3) framework development for hyperparameter extrapolation, and (4) validation on LLM fine-tuning tasks.

### Data Collection & Experimental Setup  

#### Models and Datasets  
- **Model Architectures**: Transformers with varying depths ($d \in [12, 24, 48]$) and widths ($w \in [768, 1024, 1536]$), CNNs (ResNet variants), and MLPs.  
- **Datasets**: C4 (for LLM experiments), ImageNet (vision tasks), and synthetic datasets for controlled studies.  
- **Optimizers**: AdamW, SGD with momentum, and LAMB, with hyperparameter ranges:  
  - Learning rate ($\eta$): $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2}$  
  - Batch size ($B$): $32$ to $4096$  
  - Momentum ($\beta$): $0.0$ to $0.99$  

#### Training Protocol  
1. **Small-Scale Baseline**: For each model size $L_0$ (e.g., 125M parameters), perform grid search to identify optimal hyperparameters $(\eta^*, B^*, \beta^*)$ that minimize validation loss within a fixed compute budget.  
2. **Scaling Analysis**: Train larger models ($L_1 = 1.3B$, $L_2 = 10B$) with hyperparameters extrapolated via candidate scaling laws.

### Algorithmic Steps  

#### Deriving Scaling Laws  
Assume optimal hyperparameters follow power-law relationships with model size:  
$$
\eta(L) = \eta_0 \cdot \left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)^\alpha, \quad 
B(L) = B_0 \cdot \left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)^\gamma, \quad 
\beta(L) = \beta_0 + \delta \cdot \log\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)
$$  
where $L$ is model size (number of parameters), and $\alpha, \gamma, \delta$ are exponents learned via regression.  

**Regression Procedure**:  
1. Collect $(\eta^*, B^*, \beta^*, L)$ tuples from small-scale experiments.  
2. Fit exponents using nonlinear least squares:  
   $$
   \min_{\alpha, \gamma, \delta} \sum_{i=1}^N \left\| \begin{bmatrix} \eta_i - \eta_0 (L_i/L_0)^\alpha \\ B_i - B_0 (L_i/L_0)^\gamma \\ \beta_i - \beta_0 - \delta \log(L_i/L_0) \end{bmatrix} \right\|_2^2
   $$  
3. Regularize with Bayesian priors to prevent overfitting (e.g., $\alpha \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$).  

#### Hyperparameter Transfer Framework  
Given target model size $L_T$ and baseline $(\eta_0, B_0, \beta_0)$ at $L_0$:  
1. Predict optimal hyperparameters:  
   $$
   \eta_T = \eta_0 \cdot (L_T/L_0)^{\hat{\alpha}}, \quad 
   B_T = B_0 \cdot (L_T/L_0)^{\hat{\gamma}}, \quad 
   \beta_T = \beta_0 + \hat{\delta} \cdot \log(L_T/L_0)
   $$  
2. Adjust batch size to fit GPU memory constraints via linear scaling rule: $B_T \leftarrow \min(B_T, B_{\text{max}})$.

### Experimental Validation  

#### Baselines  
- **Grid Search**: Exhaustive search on large models (prohibitively expensive but optimal).  
- **Naïve Scaling**: Heuristics like constant learning rate or linear batch size scaling.  
- **CARBS** (Fetterman et al., 2023): Cost-aware Bayesian optimization.  

#### Evaluation Metrics  
1. **Loss Prediction Accuracy**: Mean squared error between predicted and actual validation loss.  
2. **Compute Efficiency**: Compute (in PFLOPs) required to reach a target loss threshold.  
3. **Hyperparameter Transfer Gap**: $\|\eta_T - \eta^*_{\text{grid}}\| / \|\eta^*_{\text{grid}}\|$.  
4. **Generalization**: Fine-tuning performance on downstream tasks (e.g., GLUE benchmarks).  

#### Ablation Studies  
- Impact of optimizer class (AdamW vs. SGD) on scaling exponents.  
- Sensitivity to initial model size $L_0$.  
- Scaling behavior for width vs. depth increases.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Scientific Contributions  
1. **Optimization-Aware Scaling Laws**: First formal framework linking optimizer hyperparameters to model scaling, generalizing prior work (e.g., Li et al., 2025) to include momentum and optimizer choice.  
2. **Empirical Insights**:  
   - Discovery of optimizer-specific scaling exponents (e.g., AdamW’s $\alpha$ differs from SGD’s).  
   - Quantification of batch size saturation effects under memory constraints.  
3. **Theoretical Bridges**: Connections between hyperparameter scaling and nonconvex optimization theory (e.g., flat vs. sharp minima tradeoffs).  

### Practical Benefits  
1. **Framework Deployment**: Lightweight tool for hyperparameter extrapolation, integrated with HuggingFace Transformers and PyTorch.  
2. **Compute Savings**:  
   - Reduce hyperparameter search cost by 10–100× compared to CARBS (Fetterman et al., 2023).  
   - Achieve 15–20% faster convergence during LLM fine-tuning via optimized learning rate schedules.  
3. **Environmental Impact**: Cut carbon emissions by avoiding wasteful grid searches; extrapolate configurations for 10B+ models using 125M-scale experiments.  

### Validation on LLM Tasks

## 4. Conclusion  

This proposal addresses a critical bottleneck in large-scale machine learning: the absence of optimization-aware scaling laws for hyperparameter transfer. By systematically characterizing how learning rates, batch sizes, and momentum terms scale with model size and optimizer choice, we will deliver both theoretical insights and a practical framework to reduce training costs. The outcomes align with the OPT 2024 workshop’s focus on “scaling up optimization” and directly advance topics including adaptive stochastic methods, nonconvex optimization, and compute-efficient training. Ultimately, this work will empower researchers to train large models with fewer resources while deepening our understanding of optimization dynamics in high-dimensional spaces.
