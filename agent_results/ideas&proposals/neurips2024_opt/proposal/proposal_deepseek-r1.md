**Optimization-Aware Scaling Laws: Bridging Hyperparameter Dynamics and Model Scaling for Efficient Large-Scale Training**

### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Optimization is the backbone of modern machine learning (ML), driving advancements in tasks ranging from image classification to large language model (LLM) training. A critical challenge in scaling ML models is the interplay between model size, data, and optimization dynamics. While scaling laws (e.g., Kaplan et al., 2023) have established relationships between model size, dataset size, and performance, they often neglect the role of optimization algorithms and their hyperparameters. Current practices rely on costly trial-and-error tuning when scaling models, leading to prohibitive computational and environmental costs. For instance, training a single LLM can emit over 500 tons of CO₂ (Strubell et al., 2019), underscoring the urgency of efficient hyperparameter transfer strategies.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research aims to derive **optimization-aware scaling laws** that explicitly model how optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, momentum) scale with model size and optimizer choice. Key objectives include:  
1. **Empirical Characterization**: Systematically quantify how optimal hyperparameters for optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD) vary with model size.  
2. **Theoretical Formulation**: Develop mathematical scaling laws that generalize across architectures and optimizers.  
3. **Framework Development**: Create a lightweight tool to recommend hyperparameters for target model sizes, validated on LLM fine-tuning tasks.  
4. **Environmental Impact**: Reduce hyperparameter search costs by >50%, enabling compute-optimal training.  

**Significance**  
By integrating optimization dynamics into scaling laws, this work will:  
- Enable efficient hyperparameter transfer across model sizes, reducing tuning time and energy consumption.  
- Provide theoretical insights into the interaction between optimization algorithms and scaling.  
- Directly address the OPT 2024 focus on "scaling up optimization" by bridging classical optimization theory with modern large-scale ML challenges.

### 3. **Methodology**  
**Research Design**  
The study combines empirical analysis, theoretical modeling, and validation across diverse architectures.  

#### **Data Collection**  
- **Models**: Transformer-based architectures (e.g., GPT-2, LLaMA variants) scaled across sizes (10M to 1B parameters).  
- **Datasets**: C4, The Pile, and task-specific datasets (e.g., GLUE for fine-tuning).  
- **Optimizers**: Adam, SGD, and variants (e.g., AdamW, NAdam).  
- **Hyperparameters**: Learning rate ($\eta$), batch size ($B$), momentum ($\beta$), weight decay ($\lambda$).  

#### **Algorithmic Steps**  
1. **Empirical Hyperparameter Sweeps**:  
   For each model size $N \in \{N_1, N_2, ..., N_k\}$:  
   - Perform grid/Randomized search over $\eta$, $B$, $\beta$, and $\lambda$.  
   - Record training loss $\mathcal{L}$, validation accuracy, and computational cost (FLOPs).  

2. **Scaling Law Derivation**:  
   - **Power-Law Modeling**: Fit relationships between optimal hyperparameters and model size. For example:  
     $$
     \eta^*(N) = \alpha_\eta \cdot N^{\beta_\eta}, \quad B^*(N) = \alpha_B \cdot N^{\beta_B}
     $$
     where $\alpha, \beta$ are optimizer-specific constants.  
   - **Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)**: Extend Opt-Laws (Xie et al., 2024) to model optimizer dynamics. For Adam:  
     $$
     d\theta_t = -\eta \cdot \frac{m_t}{\sqrt{v_t + \epsilon}} dt + \sigma dW_t,
     $$
     where $m_t$ (first moment) and $v_t$ (second moment) are tracked to derive $\eta$ decay schedules.  

3. **Framework Development**:  
   - **Hyperparameter Recommender**: A regression model trained on empirical data predicts $\eta^*, B^*$ for a target model size $N$.  
   - **Integration with CARBS**: Leverage Bayesian optimization to refine predictions under compute constraints.  

#### **Experimental Validation**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against:  
  - Naive scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2023).  
  - CARBS (Fetterman et al., 2023) and Opt-Laws (Xie et al., 2024).  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Search Efficiency**: Number of trials to reach 95% of optimal validation accuracy.  
  - **Performance**: Final validation loss, training time (hours).  
  - **Generalization**: Transferability to unseen architectures (e.g., Vision Transformers).

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Optimization-Aware Scaling Laws**: Mathematical relationships quantifying how $\eta^*, B^*$, and $\beta$ scale with $N$ and optimizer choice.  
   - Example: For Adam, $\eta^*(N) \propto N^{-0.25}$, aligning with gradient noise theory.  
2. **Open-Source Framework**: A tool that reduces hyperparameter search costs by 50–70% for models >100M parameters.  
3. **LLM Fine-Tuning Validation**: Demonstrated success on LLaMA-2 7B fine-tuning, achieving comparable performance to hand-tuned setups with 3× fewer trials.  

**Impact**  
- **Computational Savings**: Reducing hyperparameter search iterations could save ~1.2 GWh/year per major AI lab (assuming 10 large models trained annually).  
- **Democratization of Large Models**: Lower tuning barriers for resource-constrained researchers.  
- **Theoretical Advancements**: New insights into the coupling of optimization dynamics and scaling, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.
