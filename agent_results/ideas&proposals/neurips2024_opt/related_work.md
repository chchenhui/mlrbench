By prompting LLMs with dataset and model descriptions, the authors develop a methodology where LLMs suggest hyperparameter configurations, iteratively refined based on model performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that, within constrained search budgets, LLMs can match or outperform traditional hyperparameter optimization methods like Bayesian optimization across different models on standard benchmarks.
