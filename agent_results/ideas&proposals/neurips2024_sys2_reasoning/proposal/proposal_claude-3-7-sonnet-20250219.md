# ReasonNet: A Self-Supervised Meta-Learning Framework for Emergent System-2 Reasoning in Transformer Models

## 1. Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, exhibiting human-like performance across various tasks. However, these models predominantly excel at what cognitive scientists term "System-1" thinking—fast, intuitive, pattern-recognition processes that rely heavily on memorization and association. In contrast, they struggle with "System-2" reasoning—the deliberate, rule-based, logical thinking that humans employ when solving complex problems requiring multi-step reasoning.

This limitation represents a significant barrier to the development of truly intelligent AI systems. While System-1 capabilities allow models to generate fluent text and recognize patterns, the lack of robust System-2 reasoning leads to logical inconsistencies, mathematical errors, and failures in tasks requiring step-by-step deduction. As highlighted in recent work by Weston and Sukhbaatar (2023), these limitations persist despite dramatic increases in model scale and training data, suggesting that new approaches beyond simple scaling are needed.

Current approaches to enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs typically fall into two categories: (1) external frameworks that guide model reasoning through prompting techniques like chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022) or search algorithms, and (2) specialized architectures or fine-tuning methods that attempt to improve internal reasoning capabilities. While external frameworks have shown promise, they ultimately rely on the base model's inherent reasoning abilities and add computational overhead. Meanwhile, specialized architectures often sacrifice generality for task-specific performance.

In this research, we propose ReasonNet, a novel self-supervised framework designed to foster emergent System-2 reasoning capabilities within transformer architectures. Unlike approaches that add external reasoning frameworks, ReasonNet aims to develop inherent reasoning abilities through targeted architectural modifications and training methodologies. Our approach introduces a meta-learning component called "Reflection Layers" that enables the model to evaluate its own reasoning steps, identify logical inconsistencies, and iteratively refine its problem-solving approach.

The key research objectives of this proposal are:

1. To develop architectural modifications to transformer models that enable self-reflection and iterative refinement of reasoning processes
2. To create a self-supervised learning framework that explicitly rewards logical consistency and step-by-step reasoning
3. To design novel procedural benchmarks for evaluating genuine System-2 reasoning capabilities
4. To investigate the emergence of systematic generalization in models trained with our approach

The significance of this research extends beyond academic interest. Reliable System-2 reasoning is crucial for AI safety, as it reduces unpredictable behavior and allows for more rigorous verification of model decisions. It also addresses a fundamental limitation in current AI systems, potentially enabling applications that require complex reasoning like advanced medical diagnosis, scientific discovery, and robust decision support systems. By developing models with genuine reasoning capabilities, we move closer to artificial general intelligence while enhancing the trustworthiness and utility of AI systems.

## 2. Methodology

Our methodology comprises three main components: (1) the ReasonNet architecture with Reflection Layers, (2) a multi-faceted self-supervised training framework, and (3) rigorous evaluation procedures to assess genuine System-2 reasoning capabilities.

### 2.1 ReasonNet Architecture

ReasonNet extends the standard transformer architecture by incorporating dedicated Reflection Layers that enable the model to evaluate and refine its own reasoning processes. The architecture consists of:

1. **Base Transformer Layers**: Standard transformer encoder-decoder layers that process input sequences and generate initial outputs.

2. **Reflection Layers**: Specialized transformer layers that take both the original input and the model's intermediate outputs to evaluate reasoning quality and logical consistency.

3. **Refinement Mechanism**: A gating mechanism that allows refined reasoning to be integrated back into the model's processing pipeline.

Formally, given an input sequence $X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$, the base transformer layers generate an initial output sequence $Y^{(0)} = [y_1^{(0)}, y_2^{(0)}, ..., y_m^{(0)}]$ through standard self-attention and feed-forward operations:

$$H = \text{BaseTransformer}(X)$$
$$Y^{(0)} = \text{OutputLayer}(H)$$

The Reflection Layers then evaluate the quality of this initial output by analyzing the logical structure and consistency:

$$R = \text{ReflectionLayers}([X; Y^{(0)}])$$

where $R$ represents a reflection score vector that quantifies the logical consistency of each reasoning step.

Based on these reflection scores, the model generates a refined output $Y^{(1)}$ through the refinement mechanism:

$$Y^{(1)} = Y^{(0)} + G \odot \text{RefinementLayer}([X; Y^{(0)}; R])$$

where $G$ is a gating vector determined by the reflection scores that controls how much refinement is applied to each token, and $\odot$ represents element-wise multiplication.

This process can be iterated multiple times, with each iteration $t$ producing an increasingly refined output $Y^{(t)}$:

$$R^{(t)} = \text{ReflectionLayers}([X; Y^{(t-1)}])$$
$$Y^{(t)} = Y^{(t-1)} + G^{(t)} \odot \text{RefinementLayer}([X; Y^{(t-1)}; R^{(t)}])$$

The number of refinement iterations can be either fixed or determined dynamically based on a convergence criterion.

### 2.2 Self-Supervised Training Framework

Our training framework combines three complementary approaches to develop System-2 reasoning capabilities:

#### 2.2.1 Curriculum Learning on Reasoning Tasks

We design a curriculum of increasingly complex reasoning tasks, beginning with simple logical deductions and progressing to multi-step mathematical problem-solving, complex causal reasoning, and abstract logical puzzles. The curriculum structure is as follows:

1. **Level 1**: Basic logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) and simple syllogisms
2. **Level 2**: Multi-step deductive reasoning and basic mathematical operations
3. **Level 3**: Complex mathematical problem-solving requiring multiple operations
4. **Level 4**: Abstract reasoning tasks with novel rule systems

The model progresses to the next level only after achieving a predefined performance threshold on the current level.

#### 2.2.2 Contrastive Learning between Sound and Flawed Reasoning

We employ contrastive learning to help the model distinguish between logically sound and flawed reasoning processes. For each reasoning task, we generate:

1. **Positive examples**: Logically sound reasoning paths that lead to correct conclusions
2. **Negative examples**: Flawed reasoning paths containing logical errors, irrelevant steps, or invalid inferences

The contrastive loss function is defined as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} = -\log \frac{\exp(s(Y^+, \hat{Y}^+) / \tau)}{\exp(s(Y^+, \hat{Y}^+) / \tau) + \sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(s(Y^-, \hat{Y}^-_j) / \tau)}$$

where $s(Y, \hat{Y})$ is a similarity function between the ground truth reasoning path $Y$ and the model's output $\hat{Y}$, $\tau$ is a temperature parameter, and $N$ is the number of negative examples.

#### 2.2.3 Meta-Reasoning Objectives

We introduce novel meta-reasoning objectives that explicitly reward the model for detecting and correcting logical inconsistencies in its own reasoning:

1. **Reflection Loss**: Encourages accurate assessment of reasoning quality in the Reflection Layers:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{reflection}} = \text{BCE}(R, Q)$$

where $\text{BCE}$ is binary cross-entropy loss, $R$ is the model's reflection scores, and $Q$ is a vector of ground-truth quality labels for each reasoning step.

2. **Refinement Loss**: Rewards effective refinement of reasoning paths:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{refinement}} = \text{CE}(Y^{(t)}, Y^*)$$

where $\text{CE}$ is cross-entropy loss, $Y^{(t)}$ is the refined output after $t$ iterations, and $Y^*$ is the ground-truth reasoning path.

3. **Logical Consistency Loss**: Penalizes logical contradictions and inconsistencies:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}} = \sum_{i,j} \text{Contradiction}(Y^{(t)}_i, Y^{(t)}_j)$$

where $\text{Contradiction}(Y^{(t)}_i, Y^{(t)}_j)$ measures logical contradiction between statements $i$ and $j$ in the reasoning path.

The total loss is a weighted combination of these components:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{reflection}} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{refinement}} + \lambda_4 \mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}}$$

where $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3, \lambda_4$ are hyperparameters controlling the relative importance of each loss component.

### 2.3 Evaluation Methodology

To rigorously evaluate the System-2 reasoning capabilities of our model, we propose the following evaluation methodology:

#### 2.3.1 Procedural Benchmarks

We will develop procedural benchmarks specifically designed to test genuine reasoning capabilities rather than pattern recognition. These benchmarks will:

1. Generate test cases according to logical rules that can be systematically varied
2. Include compositional problems requiring the application of multiple rules
3. Test for systematic generalization by evaluating performance on rule combinations not seen during training

Examples include procedurally generated mathematical problems, logical puzzles with parameterized rule systems, and novel reasoning tasks constructed by combining basic logical operations in ways not encountered during training.

#### 2.3.2 Data Contamination Prevention

To prevent data contamination and ensure genuine evaluation of reasoning capabilities, we will:

1. Use cryptographically secure hashing to verify that test examples are not seen during training
2. Generate evaluation examples using a different random seed and parameter range than training examples
3. Employ structural variations in test problems that preserve logical structure while changing surface features

#### 2.3.3 Evaluation Metrics

We will employ the following metrics to evaluate reasoning capabilities:

1. **Accuracy**: Percentage of problems solved correctly
2. **Logical Consistency Score**: Measure of internal consistency in reasoning steps
3. **Systematic Generalization Score**: Performance on problems requiring novel combinations of known rules
4. **Reasoning Depth Score**: Performance as a function of required reasoning steps
5. **Refinement Efficiency**: Improvement in reasoning quality across refinement iterations

#### 2.3.4 Comparative Evaluation

We will compare ReasonNet against:

1. Base transformer models of equivalent size
2. Models augmented with external reasoning frameworks (e.g., chain-of-thought, system 2 attention)
3. Recent approaches like Dualformer (Su et al., 2024) and other specialized reasoning architectures
