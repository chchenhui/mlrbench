# Learning to Reason: A Self-Supervised Framework for Emergent System-2 Capabilities

## Introduction

Current large language models (LLMs) excel in pattern recognition and memorization (System-1 thinking) but struggle with systematic, rule-based reasoning (System-2 thinking). This limitation creates barriers to reliable logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, and consistent decision-making, which are critical abilities for AI safety and trustworthiness. While scaling has improved performance, it hasn't systematically enhanced reasoning capabilities, suggesting we need novel approaches beyond simple parameter scaling to develop genuinely reasoning-capable AI systems.

This research proposal aims to address these challenges by introducing a self-supervised framework that explicitly promotes emergent System-2 reasoning within transformer architectures. Our approach introduces a meta-learning component called "Reflection Layers" that enables the model to evaluate its own reasoning steps, identify logical inconsistencies, and iteratively refine its problem-solving approach. The training process incorporates curriculum learning on increasingly complex reasoning tasks, contrastive learning between sound and flawed reasoning paths, and explicit rewards for stepwise reasoning that follows logical rules. Unlike external reasoning frameworks that augment base models, our approach aims to develop inherent reasoning capabilities within the model's architecture. We evaluate generalization using novel procedural benchmarks specifically designed to assess rule application rather than pattern matching, with rigorous protocols to prevent data contamination.

## Methodology

### Research Design

We propose a self-supervised framework for enhancing System-2 reasoning in transformer models. The framework consists of three main components: Reflection Layers, Curriculum Learning, and Contrastive Learning. These components work together to promote logical reasoning and systematic generalization in the model.

#### Reflection Layers

Reflection Layers are meta-learning components that enable the model to evaluate its own reasoning steps. They are inserted into the transformer architecture to allow the model to introspect its reasoning process and identify logical inconsistencies. The Reflection Layer operates as follows:

1. **Reasoning Step Evaluation**: After each reasoning step, the Reflection Layer evaluates the output to determine if it is logically consistent with the previous steps.
2. **Inconsistency Detection**: If an inconsistency is detected, the Reflection Layer identifies the faulty reasoning step and marks it for correction.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: The model iterates over the reasoning process, correcting identified inconsistencies and refining its problem-solving approach.

Mathematically, the Reflection Layer can be represented as follows:

$$
R(x) = \begin{cases}
x & \text{if } \text{IsLogicallyConsistent}(x) \\
\text{Corrected}(x) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where $R(x)$ is the output of the Reflection Layer, $x$ is the input reasoning step, and $\text{IsLogicallyConsistent}(x)$ is a function that checks for logical consistency.

#### Curriculum Learning

Curriculum learning involves progressively increasing the complexity of reasoning tasks during training. By starting with simple tasks and gradually introducing more complex ones, the model can learn to reason at different levels of abstraction. The curriculum learning process is as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Start with a set of simple reasoning tasks, such as basic arithmetic or logical inferences.
2. **Incremental Complexity**: Gradually introduce more complex tasks, such as multi-step reasoning or reasoning with multiple variables.
3. **Adaptive Learning**: Adjust the learning rate and other hyperparameters based on the model's performance on the current task.

The complexity of the reasoning tasks can be represented as a function of the number of steps required to solve the task:

$$
C(n) = \begin{cases}
n & \text{if } n \leq T \\
T & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where $C(n)$ is the complexity of the task with $n$ steps, and $T$ is a threshold value.

#### Contrastive Learning

Contrastive learning involves training the model on data with sound and flawed reasoning paths. By contrasting these paths, the model learns to prioritize valid reasoning steps and avoid logical inconsistencies. The contrastive learning process is as follows:

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare datasets with sound and flawed reasoning paths for each reasoning task.
2. **Contrastive Training**: Train the model to distinguish between sound and flawed reasoning paths using contrastive loss functions.
3. **Reward for Valid Reasoning**: Explicitly reward the model for following valid reasoning paths and penalize it for flawed reasoning paths.

The contrastive loss function can be represented as follows:

$$
L_{contrastive} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ y_i \cdot \log(\sigma(z_i)) + (1 - y_i) \cdot \log(1 - \sigma(z_i)) \right]
$$

where $N$ is the number of reasoning paths, $y_i$ is the label indicating whether the reasoning path is sound or flawed, $z_i$ is the model's prediction for the reasoning path, and $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.

### Experimental Design

To validate our approach, we will conduct experiments on a set of reasoning tasks with varying levels of complexity. The experimental design consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect a dataset of reasoning tasks with varying levels of complexity, including simple arithmetic, logical inferences, and multi-step reasoning.
2. **Model Training**: Train the model using the self-supervised framework described above, with curriculum learning, contrastive learning, and Reflection Layers.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on a set of procedural benchmarks designed to assess rule application and logical consistency.
4. **Comparison**: Compare the model's performance with baseline models that do not incorporate the self-supervised framework.

The evaluation metrics will include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for each reasoning task, as well as the overall performance on the procedural benchmarks.

### Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation metrics for this research include:

1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct reasoning steps out of the total number of reasoning steps.
2. **Precision**: The proportion of correct reasoning steps out of the total number of reasoning steps predicted by the model.
3. **Recall**: The proportion of correct reasoning steps out of the total number of correct reasoning steps in the ground truth.
4. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
5. **Procedural Benchmark Score**: The overall performance on the procedural benchmarks, which assess rule application and logical consistency.
