# Learning to Reason: A Self-Supervised Framework for Emergent System-2 Capabilities

## Motivation
Current large language models excel at pattern recognition and memorization (System-1 thinking) but struggle with systematic, rule-based reasoning (System-2 thinking). This limitation creates barriers to reliable logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, and consistent decision-making - critical abilities for AI safety and trustworthiness. While scaling has improved performance, it hasn't systematically enhanced reasoning capabilities, suggesting we need novel approaches beyond simple parameter scaling to develop genuinely reasoning-capable AI systems.

## Main Idea
We propose a self-supervised framework that explicitly promotes emergent System-2 reasoning within transformer architectures through targeted architectural modifications and training methodologies. Our approach introduces a meta-learning component called "Reflection Layers" that enable the model to evaluate its own reasoning steps, identify logical inconsistencies, and iteratively refine its problem-solving approach. The training process incorporates (1) curriculum learning on increasingly complex reasoning tasks, (2) contrastive learning between sound and flawed reasoning paths, and (3) explicit rewards for stepwise reasoning that follows logical rules. Unlike external reasoning frameworks that augment base models, our approach aims to develop inherent reasoning capabilities within the model's architecture. We evaluate generalization using novel procedural benchmarks specifically designed to assess rule application rather than pattern matching, with rigorous protocols to prevent data contamination.
