### Title: Enhancing System-2 Reasoning in Transformers through Hybrid Symbolic-Augmented Learning

### Motivation
The integration of System-2 reasoning capabilities in neural networks is crucial for developing AI systems that can handle complex, abstract reasoning tasks. Current transformer models often struggle with these tasks due to their reliance on memorization and lack of true understanding. By enhancing these models with hybrid symbolic-augmented learning, we can address the challenges of distinguishing memorization from rule-based learning, improving syntactic generalization, and fostering compositionality.

### Main Idea
The proposed research aims to imbue transformer models with System-2 reasoning capabilities by combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning systems. This hybrid approach involves:

1. **Symbolic Reasoning Augmentation**: Integrate symbolic reasoning modules within the transformer architecture. These modules can handle rule-based learning and provide explicit reasoning paths.

2. **Training Methodology**: Develop a novel training method that encourages the model to utilize symbolic reasoning when appropriate. This can be achieved through a combination of supervised learning on symbolic reasoning tasks and reinforcement learning to optimize the model's decision-making process.

3. **Implementation Strategy**: Implement the hybrid system explicitly within the model, allowing for dynamic switching between neural and symbolic reasoning modes based on the complexity and type of the task.

4. **Benchmarking**: Establish benchmarks to assess System-2-like generalization, ensuring that the model can handle a variety of reasoning tasks without data contamination. This includes tasks that require understanding, syntactic generalization, and compositionality.

5. **Expected Outcomes**: The expected outcomes include a transformer model that can effectively distinguish between memorization and rule-based learning, demonstrate improved syntactic generalization, and exhibit enhanced compositionality. This will significantly advance AI safety and robustness.

6. **Potential Impact**: This research has the potential to revolutionize AI by enabling systems that can perform complex, abstract reasoning tasks, enhancing their decision-making capabilities and safety. It also paves the way for more interpretable and explainable AI models.
