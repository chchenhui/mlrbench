**1. Title: A Theoretical and Empirical Investigation of Sample Complexity in Contrastive vs. Non-Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning**

---

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation learning, enabling models to extract meaningful features from vast amounts of unlabeled data across diverse modalities, including vision (Chen et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2021), language (Devlin et al., 2019), and time-series (Franceschi et al., 2019). By designing pretext tasks that leverage inherent structures within the data itself (e.g., predicting context, ensuring view invariance), SSL methods learn representations that often rival or even surpass those learned with supervised methods, especially when labeled data is scarce. Prominent SSL approaches broadly fall into two categories: contrastive methods (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo), which learn representations by pulling augmented views of the same instance closer while pushing apart views from different instances, and non-contrastive methods (e.g., BYOL, DINO, VICReg), which avoid explicit negative sampling, often relying on architectural mechanisms like momentum encoders, stop-gradients, or explicit regularization terms to prevent representation collapse (Grill et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2021; Bardes et al., 2022).

Despite the remarkable empirical success of SSL, a deep theoretical understanding of *why* and *when* these methods work well remains elusive. As highlighted by the workshop theme, there is a significant gap between the empirical advancements and the theoretical foundations of SSL. Key questions persist: How much unlabeled data is truly necessary to learn effective representations? How do architectural choices, data augmentation strategies, and specific loss functions impact the data requirements? Crucially, under what conditions should practitioners prefer contrastive over non-contrastive approaches, or vice versa, particularly when data availability is limited? Addressing these questions requires a rigorous analysis of the *sample complexity* of different SSL paradigms â€“ the relationship between the amount of training data and the quality of the learned representation for downstream tasks. While recent theoretical works have begun to explore generalization bounds (Hieu et al., 2024) and the theoretical links between SSL paradigms (Garrido et al., 2022; Balestriero & LeCun, 2022), a direct, comparative analysis of sample complexity bounds tailored to the contrastive vs. non-contrastive distinction is largely missing.

**2.2 Research Objectives**
This research aims to bridge the gap between SSL theory and practice by providing a formal understanding of the sample complexity associated with contrastive and non-contrastive learning paradigms. Our primary objectives are:

1.  **To develop a unified theoretical framework for analyzing the sample complexity of both contrastive and non-contrastive SSL methods.** This involves leveraging tools from statistical learning theory to derive bounds on the downstream generalization error as a function of the number of unlabeled pre-training samples.
2.  **To derive explicit sample complexity bounds for representative contrastive (e.g., SimCLR-like) and non-contrastive (e.g., BYOL/DINO-like) algorithms.** These bounds will aim to quantify the dependence on key factors, including the number of unlabeled samples ($n$), data augmentation properties ($\mathcal{A}$), network architecture complexity (e.g., depth, width, norms), and latent representation dimensionality ($d$).
3.  **To investigate theoretically how specific design choices influence sample efficiency.** This includes analyzing the impact of negative sampling strategies (or lack thereof), predictor networks, momentum encoders, stop-gradients, and regularization terms (e.g., variance-covariance regularization) on the derived bounds.
4.  **To empirically validate the theoretical findings through controlled experiments.** We will systematically vary the amount of unlabeled data and other key factors across different data modalities (vision, language, time-series) and measure the downstream performance of representations learned by contrastive and non-contrastive methods.
5.  **To provide practical guidelines for selecting SSL methods based on data availability and task constraints.** Based on the theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we aim to offer insights into when one paradigm might be more sample-efficient than the other.

**2.3 Significance**
Understanding the sample complexity of SSL methods offers significant benefits. Theoretically, it deepens our fundamental grasp of how unsupervised representation learning works and provides a quantitative basis for comparing different algorithmic paradigms. It addresses critical open questions identified in the SSL community and contributes to the theoretical foundations called for by the workshop. Practically, derived sample complexity bounds can guide practitioners in resource-constrained settings. Knowing the approximate data requirements for achieving a certain level of performance allows for:

*   **Efficient Resource Allocation:** Optimizing the use of computational resources and data collection efforts.
*   **Informed Model Selection:** Choosing between contrastive and non-contrastive methods based on the available unlabeled data budget and specific task requirements.
*   **Principled Algorithm Design:** Inspiring the development of novel SSL algorithms with improved sample efficiency by highlighting the factors that most critically influence data requirements.

By bridging the theory-practice gap in this crucial area, our research will provide valuable knowledge for both theoreticians seeking to understand SSL mechanisms and practitioners aiming to deploy these powerful techniques effectively.

**3. Methodology**

Our methodology integrates theoretical analysis based on statistical learning theory with comprehensive empirical validation across multiple data modalities.

**3.1 Theoretical Framework**

We consider a standard SSL setting where we are given an unlabeled dataset $S = \{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$ drawn i.i.d. from an unknown data distribution $\mathcal{D}$. An SSL algorithm uses $S$ to learn an encoder function $f_\theta: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Z}$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is the input space and $\mathcal{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is the latent representation space, parameterized by $\theta$. The quality of the learned representation $z = f_\theta(x)$ is typically evaluated by its performance on downstream tasks using a labeled dataset $S_{labeled} = \{(x'_j, y'_j)\}_{j=1}^m$, often by training a simple linear classifier $h_w: \mathcal{Z} \to \mathcal{Y}$ on top of the frozen representations $z'_j = f_\theta(x'_j)$.

Our goal is to bound the *excess generalization error* of the downstream classifier, $\mathbb{E}_{(x', y') \sim \mathcal{D}_{XY}} [L(h_w(f_\theta(x')), y')] - \min_{h'} \mathbb{E}_{(x', y') \sim \mathcal{D}_{XY}} [L(h'(f_\theta(x')), y')]$, or a related measure of representation quality, as a function of the size $n$ of the unlabeled dataset $S$. We hypothesize that this downstream error depends critically on how well the SSL pre-training objective is optimized using $S$.

**3.1.1 Formalizing SSL Objectives:**
We will formalize the objectives of representative algorithms:

*   **Contrastive (SimCLR-like):** The InfoNCE loss aims to minimize:
    $$
    \mathcal{L}_{InfoNCE}(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}, t, t' \sim \mathcal{A}} \left[ \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(f_\theta(t(x)), f_\theta(t'(x))) / \tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(f_\theta(t(x)), f_\theta(t'(x))) / \tau) + \sum_{x_j \neq x} \exp(\text{sim}(f_\theta(t(x)), f_\theta(t(x_j))) / \tau)} \right]
    $$
    where $t, t'$ are augmentation functions drawn from a family $\mathcal{A}$, $\text{sim}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity), and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter. The expectation is often estimated using mini-batches.

*   **Non-Contrastive (BYOL/DINO-like):** These methods often involve two networks (online $f_\theta$ and target $f_\xi$, where $\xi$ is often a momentum-updated version of $\theta$ or fixed) and potentially a predictor $p_\phi$. The objective aims to minimize the difference between projections of augmented views, e.g.:
    $$
    \mathcal{L}_{NonCon}(\theta, \phi) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}, t, t' \sim \mathcal{A}} \left[ L_{pred}(p_\phi(f_\theta(t(x))), \text{sg}(f_\xi(t'(x)))) \right]
    $$
    where $L_{pred}$ is a prediction loss (e.g., MSE), and $\text{sg}(\cdot)$ denotes the stop-gradient operation. Variants like DINO use cross-entropy between student ($f_\theta$) and teacher ($f_\xi$) outputs with centering and sharpening. VICReg uses variance, invariance, and covariance terms. We will focus on a representative formulation capturing the core idea of minimizing distance between positive pairs without explicit negatives, possibly incorporating regularization terms.

**3.1.2 Deriving Sample Complexity Bounds:**
We will adapt techniques from statistical learning theory, potentially building upon frameworks used for supervised learning generalization and recent SSL theory works (e.g., Hieu et al., 2024). Potential tools include:

*   **Rademacher Complexity / VC Dimension:** Bounding the complexity of the function class learned by the encoder $f_\theta$ and the downstream classifier $h_w$. This often involves relating the SSL objective to the downstream task objective.
*   **Algorithmic Stability:** Analyzing how sensitive the learned parameters $\theta$ (and thus the representation $f_\theta$) are to changes in the input dataset $S$. Uniformly stable algorithms often generalize well. We might investigate how contrastive vs. non-contrastive objectives influence stability.
*   **Information-Theoretic Measures:** Exploring bounds based on mutual information between the input data and the learned representations, potentially linking pre-training objectives to downstream task information (as explored in the Information Bottleneck principle).

Our derived bounds will take a general form like:
$$
(\text{Downstream Error}) \le (\text{SSL Training Error}) + \mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\text{Complexity}(f_\theta, h_w, \mathcal{A})}{n}}\right) + (\text{Approximation Error})
$$
The key challenge is to precisely characterize the "Complexity" term and show how it differs between contrastive and non-contrastive formulations, depending on factors like the augmentation family $\mathcal{A}$, network architecture (parameterized by depth $L$, width $W$, or norms $\| \theta \|$), latent dimension $d$, batch size $B$, temperature $\tau$, momentum $\mu$, etc. We will pay close attention to how the presence or absence of negative samples affects the complexity term and convergence rates. We will analyze how non-contrastive mechanisms (stop-gradient, predictor, momentum encoder, regularization like in VICReg) contribute to preventing collapse and influence the required sample size $n$.

**3.2 Data Collection and Datasets**
To ensure the generality of our findings, we will perform experiments across three distinct data modalities using standard benchmarks:

1.  **Computer Vision:** ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012) dataset (using the unlabeled training set for SSL pre-training). Smaller datasets like CIFAR-10/100 and STL-10 (with its unlabeled split) will also be used for controlled experiments and faster prototyping.
2.  **Natural Language Processing:** Large text corpora like Wikipedia and BookCorpus for pre-training. Downstream evaluation will use subsets of the GLUE benchmark.
3.  **Time-Series Analysis:** Large-scale datasets from the UCR Time Series Archive or larger, real-world datasets (e.g., HAR - Human Activity Recognition, ETT - Electricity Transformer Temperature) for pre-training. Downstream tasks will include classification and forecasting from the respective archives.

For each dataset, we will create subsets of varying sizes ($n$) for pre-training to empirically measure performance as a function of data availability.

**3.3 Algorithms for Comparison**
We will implement and analyze representative algorithms from each paradigm:

*   **Contrastive:** SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020), potentially MoCo v2/v3 (addressing the memory bank aspect).
*   **Non-Contrastive:** BYOL (Grill et al., 2020), DINO (Caron et al., 2021), possibly VICReg (Bardes et al., 2022) to capture regularization-based approaches.

We will use standard architectures suitable for each modality (e.g., ResNets for vision, Transformers for NLP, potentially specialized CNNs or Transformers for time-series).

**3.4 Experimental Design**

Our experiments are designed to directly test the theoretical predictions and compare the paradigms.

1.  **Sample Complexity Validation:**
    *   For each selected algorithm and dataset, we will pre-train models using varying numbers of unlabeled samples $n$ (e.g., 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 100% of the available unlabeled data).
    *   After pre-training, we will freeze the encoder $f_\theta$ and train a linear classifier $h_w$ on a fixed downstream labeled dataset.
    *   We will plot the downstream performance (e.g., linear evaluation accuracy) as a function of $n$.
    *   We will analyze the empirical convergence rates and compare them qualitatively and quantitatively (if possible) with the predictions from our theoretical bounds. We will specifically look for differences in the slopes and saturation points between contrastive and non-contrastive methods.

2.  **Ablation Studies:**
    *   **Augmentation Strength:** Vary the complexity and strength of data augmentations ($\mathcal{A}$) during pre-training and observe the impact on the required $n$ for reaching a target performance level. Compare this effect between SimCLR and BYOL/DINO.
    *   **Network Architecture:** Train models with different network capacities (e.g., ResNet-18 vs. ResNet-50; varying Transformer layers/hidden dimensions) and analyze how sample efficiency changes.
    *   **Latent Dimension:** Vary the output dimension $d$ of the encoder and study its effect on sample complexity for both types of methods.
    *   **Method-Specific Parameters:** Investigate the sensitivity to parameters like temperature $\tau$ (SimCLR), momentum $\mu$ (BYOL), or regularization weights (VICReg) in terms of sample efficiency.

3.  **Direct Comparison:**
    *   Under strictly controlled settings (identical data subsets, identical architectures where feasible, same augmentation policies, same evaluation protocol), directly compare the downstream performance curves (performance vs. $n$) for the best-tuned versions of SimCLR, BYOL, and DINO. Identify regimes of $n$ where one paradigm consistently outperforms the other.

**3.5 Evaluation Metrics**

*   **Pre-training:** Monitor SSL loss curves during training (primarily for convergence diagnostics, not direct comparison).
*   **Downstream Performance:**
    *   *Primary Metric:* Linear Evaluation Accuracy/Score. This measures the quality of the frozen features.
    *   *Secondary Metric:* Fine-tuning Performance. Evaluate performance after fine-tuning the entire pre-trained encoder on the downstream task.
    *   *Modality-Specific Metrics:* Top-1/Top-5 Accuracy (ImageNet), Average GLUE score (NLP), Classification Accuracy / MSE (Time-Series).
*   **Representation Quality:** K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classification accuracy using the frozen representations on the downstream validation set. This provides another perspective on representation quality without training a linear layer.

*   **Guiding Practical Applications:** The findings will offer concrete guidance to ML practitioners, data scientists, and engineers on selecting the most appropriate SSL method for their specific constraints, particularly in domains where unlabeled data might be abundant but not infinite, or where labeling is prohibitively expensive. This leads to more efficient model development and deployment.
*   **Informing Future Algorithm Design:** By identifying the key factors influencing sample complexity, our work may inspire the development of novel SSL algorithms that are explicitly designed for sample efficiency, potentially combining beneficial aspects of both contrastive and non-contrastive approaches or proposing new regularization techniques.

*   **Facilitating Cross-Modal Understanding:** By conducting experiments across vision, NLP, and time-series, the research will contribute to a more unified understanding of SSL principles beyond single modalities.

Ultimately, this research aims to make self-supervised learning more accessible, understandable, and efficient, enabling its broader adoption and maximizing its potential across scientific and industrial applications.
