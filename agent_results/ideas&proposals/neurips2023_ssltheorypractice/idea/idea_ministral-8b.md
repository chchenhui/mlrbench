### Title: "Theoretical Analysis of Auxiliary Task Design in Self-Supervised Learning"

### Motivation
The success of self-supervised learning (SSL) in various domains is evident, but the underlying theoretical foundations remain unclear. Understanding why certain auxiliary tasks perform better than others is crucial for designing more effective SSL models. This research aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice by providing a theoretical framework for analyzing the effectiveness of auxiliary tasks in SSL.

### Main Idea
This research will develop a theoretical model to analyze the performance of different auxiliary tasks in SSL. The methodology involves:

1. **Formulation of Auxiliary Tasks**: We will formalize various auxiliary tasks used in SSL, such as contrastive learning, masked language modeling, and prediction-based tasks.
2. **Theoretical Analysis**: Using information theory and statistical learning theory, we will derive conditions under which each auxiliary task is effective. This includes analyzing the sample complexity and the impact of neural architectures.
3. **Empirical Validation**: We will empirically validate our theoretical findings by comparing the performance of SSL models trained on different auxiliary tasks across various datasets and tasks.

Expected outcomes include:

- A theoretical framework for understanding the effectiveness of auxiliary tasks in SSL.
- Insights into the sample complexity requirements for different tasks.
- Practical guidelines for designing effective SSL models.

Potential impact:

- Improved SSL models with better theoretical foundations.
- Enhanced understanding of when and why SSL outperforms supervised learning.
- Practical applications in diverse domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare.
