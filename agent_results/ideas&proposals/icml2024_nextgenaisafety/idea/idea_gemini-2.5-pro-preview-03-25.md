**Title:** Proactive Harm Recognition: Embedding Safety Constraints within Agentic AI Decision Processes

**Motivation:** As AI agents gain autonomy (Agentic AI), ensuring they operate within ethical and safety boundaries becomes paramount. Current approaches often rely on post-hoc checks or pre-defined rules, which may fail against novel situations or adversarial exploitation. This research aims to create agents that proactively recognize and avoid potentially harmful actions *during* their decision-making process.

**Main Idea:** We propose integrating a "Harm Potential Predictor" module directly into the agent's planning or policy network. This module, trained using reinforcement learning with simulated environments and curated datasets of potential harms (privacy violations, safety protocol breaches, unethical actions), would predict a multi-dimensional harm score for potential future states resulting from the agent's considered actions. This score would act as a negative reward signal or a constraint within the agent's decision-making optimization (e.g., added to a Q-value estimate or used in Monte Carlo Tree Search pruning). The expected outcome is an agent that intrinsically avoids paths leading to predictable harm, exhibiting safer behavior even in unforeseen circumstances, thereby enhancing trustworthiness.
