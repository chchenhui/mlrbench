1. **Title**: Knowledge Filtering Frameworks: Balancing Harmful Content Mitigation and Scientific Progress in Multimodal AI  

2. **Motivation**: As AI systems gain expertise in complex domains like chemistry, biology, and cybersecurity, they risk disseminating actionable information for bioweapons, cyberattacks, or toxic synthetic compounds. Existing safeguards struggle to distinguish between legitimate research (e.g., pandemic preparedness) and misuse (e.g., weaponizing pathogens). This research addresses the urgent need to protect public safety without stifling beneficial innovation.  

3. **Main Idea**: Propose a hybrid filtering framework combining **intent detection** (via multimodal natural language understanding of query context), **content sensitivity analysis** (using domain-specific knowledge graphs to assess potential harm), and **ethical justification layers** (e.g., public health impact vs. misuse likelihood). Train models on adversarially generated datasets pairing legitimate and malicious intent cases, annotated by interdisciplinary experts (bioethicists, cybersecurity researchers). Deploy a tiered review system: harmful outputs trigger human-AI collaborative audits, while non-threatening queries (e.g., academic research) proceed unimpeded. Expected outcomes include reducing harmful knowledge dissemination by â‰¥85% ($\textit{evaluated via red-team challenges}$) while maintaining accessibility for 90%+ of benign scientific queries, ensuring AI remains a tool for societal progress.
