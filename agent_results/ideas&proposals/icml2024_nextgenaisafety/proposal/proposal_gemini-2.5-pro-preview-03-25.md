## 1. Title: Dynamic Risk-Adaptive Filtering for Mitigating Dangerous Capabilities in Large Language Models

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Background
The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has ushered in an era of unprecedented capabilities across diverse applications. These general-purpose AI systems demonstrate remarkable proficiency in understanding, generating, and interacting with human language and knowledge. However, this progress is accompanied by significant safety challenges, as highlighted in the call for research on the "Next Generation of AI Safety." One critical concern, categorized under "Dangerous Capabilities," is the potential for these powerful models to be misused, either intentionally or inadvertently, to generate or disseminate harmful information. This includes detailed instructions or sensitive knowledge related to illicit activities such as designing bioweapons, executing sophisticated cyber-attacks, or synthesizing dangerous materials.

Current safety mechanisms often rely on static blocklists or overly rigid refusal policies. While simple to implement, these approaches face limitations. Static blocklists are easily circumvented by adversaries using creative phrasing or re-contextualization and struggle to keep pace with evolving misuse tactics. Overly broad refusal policies, conversely, can significantly hinder the legitimate use of AI for beneficial research, education, and innovation by blocking harmless queries that may contain superficially sensitive terms (false positives). This creates a critical dilemma: how can we effectively prevent the malicious exploitation of AI's knowledge capabilities without unduly restricting its positive potential?

Addressing this challenge requires a more nuanced, context-aware, and adaptive approach. The system must differentiate between genuinely harmful requests and legitimate inquiries that might touch upon sensitive topics. It needs to adapt to the specific risk posed by a query and respond proportionally, moving beyond a binary allow/deny paradigm. The increasing sophistication of AI necessitates safety mechanisms that are equally sophisticated, capable of dynamic risk assessment and adaptive response generation.

### 2.2 Research Objectives
This research proposes the development and evaluation of a **Dynamic Risk-Adaptive Filtering (DRAF)** system designed to intercept and manage user queries posed to powerful AI models, specifically targeting the mitigation of dangerous capability disclosures. The primary goal is to create a robust safety layer that accurately assesses the potential harm associated with a query and applies a corresponding, contextually appropriate mitigation strategy, thereby balancing safety and utility.

The specific objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop a High-Fidelity Risk Classifier:** To design and train a machine learning model capable of accurately assigning a continuous risk score to user queries based on their potential to elicit dangerous information. This involves curating a comprehensive threat taxonomy and corresponding dataset, incorporating adversarial examples to enhance robustness.
2.  **Design a Dynamic Policy Enforcement Mechanism:** To formulate and implement a multi-level policy framework that translates the continuous risk score into specific actions, ranging from allowing the query, providing a safely templated response, to refusing the request with appropriate guidance.
3.  **Integrate Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for Policy Refinement:** To leverage human judgment to fine-tune the risk thresholds and response strategies (especially for medium-risk queries and borderline cases), optimizing the trade-off between safety (harmlessness) and utility (helpfulness), drawing inspiration from frameworks like Safe RLHF.
4.  **Evaluate the DRAF System Comprehensively:** To rigorously assess the effectiveness of the proposed system using a diverse benchmark dataset of simulated dangerous and benign queries, measuring key performance indicators such as false negative rates (dangerous content leakage), false positive rates (unnecessary blocking), utility preservation, and system robustness against adversarial inputs.

### 2.3 Significance
This research directly addresses a critical and escalating AI safety concern â€“ the prevention of misuse related to dangerous capabilities. The successful development of the DRAF system would represent a significant advancement over existing static filtering methods. Its potential impact includes:

*   **Enhanced AI Safety:** By providing a more effective mechanism for identifying and mitigating potentially harmful queries, the DRAF system can significantly reduce the risk of AI models being used to generate dangerous content, contributing to safer AI deployment.
*   **Preservation of Utility:** The dynamic, risk-adaptive nature of the filter aims to minimize the blocking of legitimate, harmless queries, thereby preserving the utility of powerful AI models for research, education, and innovation.
*   **Contribution to Responsible AI Development:** This work contributes to the broader field of trustworthy and responsible AI by offering a practical, adaptable methodology for managing specific safety risks associated with highly capable models.
*   **Advancement in AI Safety Techniques:** The research explores the integration of risk classification, dynamic policy execution, and RLHF for safety applications, potentially informing the development of safety mechanisms for other AI risks (e.g., bias, misinformation).
*   **Building Public Trust:** Demonstrating effective safeguards against the misuse of AI for dangerous purposes can help build public trust and confidence in the deployment of advanced AI technologies.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Overall Architecture
The proposed Dynamic Risk-Adaptive Filtering (DRAF) system operates as an intermediary layer between the user and the target LLM. It intercepts each user query ($q$) before it reaches the LLM for response generation. The system comprises two main stages, followed by continuous refinement using RLHF:

1.  **Stage 1: Risk Classification:** Assigns a continuous risk score $s \in [0, 1]$ to the input query $q$.
2.  **Stage 2: Dynamic Policy Enforcement:** Based on the score $s$ and predefined, adaptable thresholds, determines the appropriate action: allow generation, provide a templated safe response, or refuse the query.

The entire process can be visualized as:
User Query ($q$) -> [Stage 1: Risk Classifier -> Risk Score ($s$)] -> [Stage 2: Policy Enforcement -> Action (Allow/Template/Refuse)] -> (LLM Interaction or Direct Response)

### 3.2 Stage 1: Risk Classification

#### 3.2.1 Data Collection and Curation
A crucial component is the creation of a high-quality dataset for training the risk classifier. This dataset will comprise:
*   **Dangerous Queries:** Examples of prompts aimed at eliciting information related to predefined dangerous capabilities (e.g., step-by-step instructions for building weapons, synthesizing illegal substances, planning cyberattacks). This will be based on a carefully curated **Threat Taxonomy** covering areas like biosecurity, cybersecurity, chemical threats, etc. These examples will be generated through expert consultation, red teaming efforts, and potentially synthetic data generation using powerful assisting models (with careful oversight).
*   **Benign but Sensitive Queries:** Examples of queries that might touch upon sensitive topics or keywords but are intended for legitimate purposes (e.g., scientific research on pathogens, cybersecurity education, historical inquiries about warfare).
*   **Benign Queries:** A broad collection of harmless, everyday queries to ensure the classifier doesn't flag innocuous requests.
*   **Adversarial Examples:** Queries specifically designed to bypass simple filters, using techniques like obfuscation, rephrasing, context injection, role-playing instructions, or breaking down requests into smaller parts. These will be generated using automated techniques (e.g., gradient-based attacks on a preliminary classifier) and manual crafting.

Each query in the dataset will be labeled with a risk category (e.g., High, Medium, Low/Benign) and potentially fine-grained annotations related to the specific threat type. For training the continuous score predictor, these categorical labels can be mapped to target score ranges (e.g., High: [0.8, 1.0], Medium: [0.4, 0.6], Low: [0, 0.2]), or a regression approach can be used if continuous risk labels can be reliably estimated.

#### 3.2.2 Model Architecture and Training
We propose using a transformer-based model (e.g., fine-tuning a RoBERTa or DeBERTa variant) as the core risk classifier, $f_\theta$. These models excel at capturing semantic nuances and context within the input query.

*   **Input:** User query $q$.
*   **Output:** A continuous risk score $s = f_\theta(q)$, where $s \in [0, 1]$. A higher score indicates a higher perceived risk of the query leading to dangerous content generation.
*   **Training:** The model $f_\theta$ will be trained using the curated dataset described above. We will employ a suitable loss function, likely a combination of cross-entropy loss (if using target categories initially) and potentially a regression loss (like Mean Squared Error) if aiming directly for continuous scores mapped from categorical labels or expert ratings. Techniques like focal loss might be employed to handle potential class imbalance (many more benign queries than dangerous ones). Training will incorporate the adversarial examples to improve robustness.

The classifier's output $s$ captures the assessed probability and severity of potential harm associated with the query.

### 3.3 Stage 2: Dynamic Policy Enforcement

Based on the risk score $s$ obtained from Stage 1, a dynamic policy $\Pi(s)$ determines the system's action. This policy relies on two learnable or configurable thresholds, $\tau_{low}$ and $\tau_{high}$ ($0 < \tau_{low} < \tau_{high} < 1$):

*   **If $s < \tau_{low}$ (Low Risk):** The query $q$ is deemed safe and is passed directly to the target LLM for a standard response generation. Action: `Allow`.
*   **If $\tau_{low} \le s < \tau_{high}$ (Medium Risk):** The query is considered potentially problematic or borderline. Instead of outright refusal or direct generation, the system triggers a **Safe Completion Template**. This involves generating a response that acknowledges the user's area of interest but deliberately omits sensitive details, provides high-level context, or focuses on safety considerations and ethical implications. Examples:
    *   Responding to "How to synthesize compound X?" with "Synthesizing chemical compounds requires specialized knowledge, equipment, and adherence to strict safety protocols. Information on hazardous materials is regulated. For legitimate research, consult peer-reviewed scientific literature and institutional safety guidelines."
    *   Responding to "Steps to secure a network?" with "Network security is a complex field involving firewalls, intrusion detection systems, access control, and regular audits. Specific implementations depend heavily on the network architecture and threat model. Consulting cybersecurity professionals is recommended for critical infrastructure."
    These templates can be pre-defined or dynamically generated by a constrained LLM call focused on informing without instructing harmfully. The selection or generation might be conditioned on the specific threat category identified by the classifier. Action: `Template`.
*   **If $s \ge \tau_{high}$ (High Risk):** The query is assessed as highly likely to be aimed at eliciting dangerous information. The system refuses to process the query directly. The refusal message will be carefully crafted to be informative but firm, avoiding lecturing tones. It may optionally include redirection pointers to verified, legitimate resources or authorities relevant to the user's *apparent* (but potentially misrepresented) area of interest, if deemed safe and appropriate. Action: `Refuse`.

The initial values for $\tau_{low}$ and $\tau_{high}$ will be set based on preliminary analysis of the classifier's score distribution on a validation set, balancing initial estimates of acceptable false negatives and false positives.

### 3.4 Fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

While the initial classifier and thresholds provide a baseline, optimizing the subtle trade-offs, especially for medium-risk queries and threshold boundaries, requires human judgment. We will employ RLHF to fine-tune the policy $\Pi$, potentially adjusting the thresholds $\tau_{low}, \tau_{high}$ or even refining the behavior of the risk classifier $f_\theta$ and the templating mechanism.

1.  **Preference Data Collection:** Human evaluators will be presented with queries (especially those near the initial thresholds or classified as medium-risk) and pairs of possible system responses (e.g., allow vs. template, template vs. refuse, different template variations). Evaluators will indicate their preference based on maximizing helpfulness while ensuring harmlessness, similar to the approach in Safe RLHF [1]. We will collect a dataset $D_{pref} = \{(q, y_1, y_0)\}$ where $y_1$ is the preferred response/action over $y_0$ for query $q$.
2.  **Reward Model Training:** A reward model $R_\phi(q, a)$ will be trained to predict human preferences, where $a$ represents the action (Allow, Template, Refuse) taken by the policy $\Pi$ for query $q$. The reward model learns to assign higher scores to actions that align with human judgments on safety and utility. Following Dai et al. [1], we might train separate reward (helpfulness) and cost (harmlessness) models or a single model incorporating safety constraints. The reward model aims to satisfy: $P(y_1 \succ y_0 | q) = \sigma(R_\phi(q, y_1) - R_\phi(q, y_0))$.
3.  **Policy Optimization:** A reinforcement learning algorithm, likely Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), will be used to fine-tune the policy $\Pi$. The policy could involve adjusting the parameters of the classifier $f_\theta$ indirectly, or directly optimizing the thresholds $\tau_{low}$ and $\tau_{high}$. The RL agent's objective is to maximize the expected reward from the learned reward model $R_\phi$, while staying close to the original policy to maintain stability, potentially incorporating risk-aware objectives like CVaR as explored by Chen et al. [3] or RA-PbRL concepts [2] to explicitly manage downside risk (allowing dangerous content). The optimization objective can be formulated as:
    $$ \max_{\psi} \mathbb{E}_{q \sim D_{query}, a \sim \pi_\psi(\cdot|q)} [R_\phi(q, a) - \beta D_{KL}(\pi_\psi(\cdot|q) || \pi_{ref}(\cdot|q))] $$
    where $\pi_\psi$ is the policy being optimized (which determines $a$ based on $s = f_\theta(q)$ and thresholds), $\pi_{ref}$ is the reference policy (e.g., the policy before RLHF), $R_\phi$ is the reward model, and $\beta$ is a KL divergence penalty coefficient. If using risk-aware objectives, the expectation $\mathbb{E}$ might be replaced or augmented with a risk measure like CVaR applied to a cost function derived from $R_\phi$.

This RLHF loop allows the system to adapt to nuanced human preferences regarding the safety-utility trade-off, improving the calibration of the risk assessment and the appropriateness of the policy responses.

### 3.5 Continuous Adaptation
The threat landscape is not static. New methods for misuse will emerge. The DRAF system must be adaptable. We plan for:
*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitoring queries flagged as medium/high risk and periodically sampling allowed queries for manual review or analysis.
*   **Dataset Augmentation:** Regularly updating the training dataset with new examples of dangerous queries, adversarial attacks, and challenging benign queries identified through monitoring and red teaming.
*   **Model Retraining:** Periodically retraining the risk classifier $f_\theta$ and potentially re-running the RLHF fine-tuning process to incorporate new data and adapt to evolving threats and changing notions of acceptable risk/utility balance.

### 3.6 Experimental Design

#### 3.6.1 Datasets
*   **Training/Validation:** The curated dataset described in Section 3.2.1.
*   **Evaluation:** A held-out test set constructed similarly to the training set, ensuring no overlap. This test set will include:
    *   A diverse range of simulated dangerous queries across the defined Threat Taxonomy.
    *   Benign queries designed to be similar to dangerous ones (edge cases).
    *   Standard benign queries.
    *   A set of adversarial queries generated using techniques potentially unseen during training.
    *   Potentially leverage existing (if available) or newly created benchmarks for evaluating safety filters (e.g., based on datasets like Anthropic's Red Team Attempts or Safety-Prompts).

#### 3.6.2 Baselines
The performance of the DRAF system will be compared against:
1.  **No Filter:** The target LLM without any safety filtering layer (to establish maximum potential harm).
2.  **Static Keyword/Regex Blocking:** A baseline using a manually compiled list of high-risk keywords and patterns.
3.  **Simple Classifier + Hard Refusal:** A system using the trained risk classifier $f_\theta$ but with only two actions (Allow if $s < \tau_{fixed}$, Refuse otherwise), without templating or RLHF.
4.  **DRAF without RLHF:** The proposed two-stage system with initial thresholds, before RLHF fine-tuning.

#### 3.6.3 Evaluation Metrics
*   **Safety Metrics:**
    *   **False Negative Rate (FNR):** The proportion of truly dangerous queries that are incorrectly allowed or receive an insufficiently protective template. This is the primary safety metric. $FNR = \frac{FN}{FN + TP}$ (where TP are correctly identified dangerous queries, FN are missed dangerous queries). We will aim for near-zero FNR on high-severity threats.
    *   **Risk Score Accuracy:** Metrics like AUC-ROC or Precision-Recall curves for the risk classifier $f_\theta$.
*   **Utility Metrics:**
    *   **False Positive Rate (FPR):** The proportion of benign queries that are incorrectly templated or refused. $FPR = \frac{FP}{FP + TN}$ (where FP are incorrectly blocked benign queries, TN are correctly allowed benign queries).
    *   **Benign Query Success Rate:** Percentage of benign queries that receive a full, accurate response from the LLM (i.e., are correctly classified as low-risk and allowed).
    *   **Templated Response Quality (Qualitative/User Study):** Assess the usefulness and clarity of the safe completion templates provided for medium-risk queries via human rating or user satisfaction surveys.
*   **Robustness Metrics:** FNR measured specifically on the adversarial query set.
*   **Computational Overhead:** Latency introduced by the DRAF system per query.

#### 3.6.4 Evaluation Protocol
*   Conduct evaluations on the held-out test set.
*   Perform cross-validation during model development phases.
*   Run ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components (e.g., adversarial training, RLHF, templating mechanism).
*   Analyze performance across different threat categories and query complexities.
*   Include qualitative analysis of failure cases (both false negatives and false positives) to identify areas for improvement.

### 4.2 Potential Impact
The successful completion of this research holds significant potential for positive impact:

*   **Scientific Impact:** This work will advance the state-of-the-art in AI safety mechanisms, particularly for mitigating risks associated with dangerous capabilities. It provides a novel framework integrating risk modeling, dynamic policies, and human feedback. The methodology and findings could inspire similar approaches for other AI safety challenges like bias or toxicity filtering. The curated dataset will be a valuable contribution to the research community.

### 4.3 Limitations and Future Work
We acknowledge potential limitations and avenues for future research:
*   **Data Scarcity and Quality:** Creating a truly comprehensive dataset covering all potential dangerous capabilities and adversarial attacks is challenging. The performance will depend heavily on data quality.
*   **Adversarial Robustness:** The "cat-and-mouse" game between safety measures and adversarial attacks is ongoing. Continuous effort will be needed to maintain robustness against novel circumvention techniques.
*   **Scalability and Latency:** The filter adds computational overhead. Ensuring low latency for real-time interaction might require optimization.
*   **Subjectivity of Risk and Ethics:** Defining "dangerous" and determining appropriate responses involves ethical judgments that may vary. The RLHF process helps align with specific human values, but these may need broader societal input.

Future work could explore extensions to multimodal contexts (handling dangerous images or instructions embedded in mixed media), improving the sophistication of safe templating, developing theoretical guarantees for risk bounds (potentially building on work like [2, 3]), and exploring federated learning approaches to update the system using data from diverse deployments without centralizing sensitive query information.
