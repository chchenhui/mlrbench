**Title:** Topology-Aware Latent Space Embedding for Deep Generative Models  

---

### 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Deep generative models (DGMs), such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing high-dimensional data. However, their latent spaces often fail to capture the intrinsic topological structure of the data manifold, leading to poor interpolation, unstable out-of-distribution (OOD) generation, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This misalignment arises because standard DGMs prioritize statistical similarity (e.g., pixel-level fidelity) over geometric and topological consistency.  

Recent advances in topological data analysis (TDA) have demonstrated that data manifolds possess complex topological features—such as clusters, loops, and voids—that are critical for structured understanding. Persistent homology, a TDA tool for quantifying multiscale topological features, offers a principled way to characterize these properties. Integrating TDA into DGMs has the potential to align latent spaces with data topology, improving expressivity and robustness.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research aims to:  
1. Develop a *topology-aware latent space embedding framework* that preserves the intrinsic topological properties of data manifolds in deep generative models.  
2. Formulate a differentiable topological regularization term using persistent homology to guide latent space learning.  
3. Validate the framework’s efficacy through experimental studies on tasks including interpolation, OOD generation, and adversarial robustness.  

**Significance**  
By encoding topological priors into latent space design, this work addresses foundational challenges in DGMs, such as manifold mismatch and poor generalization. The proposed framework promotes robust, interpretable, and data-efficient generative modeling, with applications in scientific discovery (e.g., molecular design) and computer vision.  

**Related Work**  
Current approaches to topology-aware generative modeling focus on integrating TDA into specific components of DGMs. For instance:  
- **TopoDiffusionNet** (Gupta et al., 2024) uses persistent homology to guide diffusion processes.  
- **GTNs** (Levy-Jurgenson and Yakhini, 2024) employ low-dimensional latent spaces for topology preservation.  
- **GAGA** (Sun et al., 2024) combines Riemannian geometry with autoencoders for metric learning.  

While these works highlight the potential of TDA in generative tasks, they primarily focus on modifying generation processes or output spaces rather than explicitly regularizing latent structures. This project bridges this gap by introducing a latent space regularization mechanism based on persistent homology.

### 2. Methodology  

#### 2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
- **Datasets**: Experiments will use:  
  - **Standard benchmarks** (MNIST, CIFAR-10) for baseline comparisons.  
  - **Scientific datasets** (e.g., molecular graphs from QM9, protein structures) to evaluate domain-specific efficacy.  
  - **Synthetic manifolds** with known topology (e.g., tori, spheres) for controlled validation.  
- **Preprocessing**: Normalize data, apply standard augmentations, and extract latent representations using pretrained models (e.g., ResNet-50) for high-dimensional datasets.  

#### 2.2 Topological Feature Extraction via Persistent Homology  
For each input batch $X = \{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$:  
1. Compute **persistence diagrams** $P_{\text{data}}$ using Vietoris-Rips filtration:  
   - Construct a distance matrix $D_{ij} = \|x_i - x_j\|$.  
   - Track topological features (connected components, loops) across scales.  
2. For latent codes $Z = \{z_1, \dots, z_n\}$ generated by the encoder $E_\theta$, compute $P_{\text{latent}}$ similarly.  

#### 2.3 Latent Space Regularization Design  
The topology-aware regularization term minimizes the Wasserstein distance between $P_{\text{data}}$ and $P_{\text{latent}}$:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{topo}} = W_2(P_{\text{data}}, P_{\text{latent}}),
$$  
where $W_2$ is the 2-Wasserstein distance. For computational efficiency, we approximate the distance using sliced Wasserstein kernels and employ mini-batch approximations.  

#### 2.4 Model Architecture and Training  
- **Base Architecture**: A VAE with encoder $E_\theta$ and decoder $D_\phi$.  
- **Loss Function**:  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{q_\theta(z|x)}[-\log D_\phi(x|z)]}_{\text{Reconstruction}} + \beta \cdot \underbrace{D_{\text{KL}}(q_\theta(z|x) \| p(z))}_{\text{KL Divergence}} + \lambda \cdot \underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\text{topo}}}_{\text{Topology Regularization}},
  $$  
  where $\beta$ and $\lambda$ are tunable hyperparameters.  

- **Differentiable TDA**: Use the **Perslay** framework (Carrière et al., 2020) for end-to-end differentiation of persistence diagram computations.  

#### 2.5 Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics  
1. **Baselines**: Compare against:  
   - Standard VAEs and GANs.  
   - Topology-aware models (TopoDiffusionNet, GAGA).  
2. **Evaluation Metrics**:  
   - **Topological Fidelity**: Bottleneck/Wasserstein distances between real and generated data persistence diagrams.  
   - **Generation Quality**: Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS).  
   - **Interpolation**: Geodesic consistency via Procrustes analysis.  
   - **Robustness**: Success rates under Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) adversarial attacks.  
   - **Computational Cost**: Training time and memory usage.  

3. **Tasks**:  
   - Conditional generation of molecules with desired topological properties.  
   - Cross-domain interpolation (e.g., transforming a chair into a table while preserving structural integrity).

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Topological Alignment**: The proposed model will exhibit latent spaces with persistence diagrams closely matching those of the data manifold (validated via statistical tests).  
2. **Enhanced Interpolation and OOD Generation**: By preserving manifold structure, interpolations will follow geodesic paths, and OOD samples will maintain plausible topology.  
3. **Increased Robustness**: Topology regularization will reduce sensitivity to adversarial perturbations, as measured by a >20% decrease in attack success rates compared to vanilla VAEs.  

**Impact**  
- **Scientific Applications**: Enable precise generation of molecules or materials with targeted topological properties (e.g., porous structures for catalysis).  
- **Theoretical Contributions**: Provide insights into the role of topology in latent space design, advancing the understanding of DGM expressivity.  
- **Broader Implications**: The framework’s modularity allows integration with other generative architectures (e.g., diffusion models), fostering cross-domain adoption.
