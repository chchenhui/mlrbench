Title  
Topology-Aware Latent Space Embedding for Enhanced Deep Generative Models  

1. Introduction  

1.1 Background  
Deep generative models (DGMs)—including variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and diffusion models—have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing realistic images, text, and scientific data. However, a persistent challenge is that the learned latent spaces often fail to mirror the true topology of the underlying data manifold. As a result, interpolation between latent codes may traverse regions that no longer correspond to valid data, and extrapolation to out‐of‐distribution samples can produce implausible or low‐quality outputs. Topological data analysis (TDA), particularly persistent homology, offers a principled way to capture global shape features—connected components, loops, and voids—across multiple scales. Recent works (e.g., TopoDiffusionNet, Topology‐Aware Latent Diffusion for 3D Shape Generation) demonstrate that enforcing topological constraints in the generation process can yield more controlled and semantically meaningful samples. Yet integrating TDA into the training of mainstream DGMs remains computationally expensive, unstable under noise, and poorly understood across diverse data domains.  

1.2 Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to design, implement, and evaluate a topology‐aware latent embedding framework that:  
• Extracts persistent homology summaries from high‐dimensional data batches with minimal overhead through vectorized persistence landscapes.  
• Defines a differentiable topological regularizer that aligns the encoder’s latent distribution with the data manifold’s topological invariants.  
• Integrates this regularizer into the loss of VAEs and diffusion models, yielding models we call TopoVAE and TopoDiffusionLite.  
• Demonstrates improved interpolation, robustness to adversarial perturbations, and out‐of‐distribution generation across image, scientific, and structured‐data domains.  

1.3 Significance  
By aligning latent geometry with intrinsic data topology, our approach addresses core expressivity and generalization challenges in DGMs. We expect (1) smoother latent interpolations that respect data clusters and loops; (2) more reliable generation of rare or boundary‐region samples; (3) enhanced model robustness under perturbations; and (4) a general recipe for extending topological regularization to other generative architectures. These advances have immediate impact on tasks such as data augmentation in medical imaging, generative modeling for chemical and biological discovery, and robust representation learning in safety‐critical applications.  

2. Methodology  

2.1 Overview  
Our method comprises four main components: (a) data preprocessing and batch sampling, (b) topological feature extraction via persistent homology, (c) latent‐space regularization, and (d) model training and evaluation. We describe each in turn.  

2.2 Data Preprocessing and Batch Sampling  
We target three representative data domains:  
• Image data (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR‐10) to test topological features like loops in digit shapes.  
• Molecular or scientific point‐cloud data (e.g., 3D protein conformations).  
• Structured graph data (e.g., social‐network subgraphs).  

Each mini‐batch $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^B$ is preprocessed (normalization, cropping) and passed through an encoder $E_\phi$ to yield latent codes $\{z_i = E_\phi(x_i)\}_{i=1}^B$.  

2.3 Topological Feature Extraction  
For each batch of original data $\{x_i\}$, we compute a persistence diagram $D^X$ capturing $H_0, H_1$ homology (connected components and loops). Direct computation of persistent homology on raw high‐dimensional data is costly, so we project each sample onto a low‐dimensional feature space via an initial autoencoder, then apply a k‐nearest‐neighbors filtration. We convert $D^X$ into a persistence landscape $\Lambda^X=\{\lambda_k(t)\}_{k=1}^K$ or persistence image $P^X$. Formally, the $k$th landscape is  
$$  
\lambda_k(t)\;=\;\text{the $k$th largest}\;\{\mu_{(b,d)}(t)\mid (b,d)\in D^X\},  
$$  
where  
$$  
\mu_{(b,d)}(t)=\max\{\,0,\min(t-b,d-t)\,\}.  
$$  

We apply the same pipeline to the batch of reconstructions or generated samples $\{\hat x_i\}$ to obtain $\Lambda^{\hat X}$.  

2.4 Latent‐Space Topological Regularizer  
We define a differentiable topological loss that penalizes misalignment between $\Lambda^X$ and $\Lambda^{\hat X}$. Using the $L_2$ distance on landscapes, the regularizer is  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{topo}} \;=\;\|\Lambda^X - \Lambda^{\hat X}\|_2^2  
\;=\;\sum_{k=1}^K \int \bigl(\lambda_k^X(t)-\lambda_k^{\hat X}(t)\bigr)^2\,dt.  
$$  
Alternatively, for persistence images $P^X,P^{\hat X}\in\mathbb{R}^{H\times W}$ one can use  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{topo}} \;=\;\|P^X - P^{\hat X}\|_F^2\,.  
$$  

2.5 Generative Model Architectures  
We implement two variants:  

A. TopoVAE  
Encoder $E_\phi:\,x\mapsto(\mu,\sigma)$, latent code $z\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2I)$, decoder $G_\theta(z)\to\hat x$. Loss:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VAE}}  
=\; \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)}[-\log p_\theta(x|z)]}_{\text{reconstruction}}  
\;+\;\beta \underbrace{D_{\mathrm{KL}}(q_\phi(z|x)\,\|\,p(z))}_{\text{KL prior}}  
\;+\;\gamma\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{topo}}\,.  
$$  

B. TopoDiffusionLite  
A simplified score‐matching diffusion model with noise schedule $\{\sigma_t\}$ and score network $s_\theta(x,t)$. At each denoising step, we extract a small batch of intermediate reconstructions $\tilde x_t$ and compute $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{topo}}(\tilde x_t,x)$. The training objective becomes  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{diff}}  
=\mathbb{E}_{t,x,\epsilon}\bigl[\|\epsilon - s_\theta(x_t,t)\|_2^2\bigr]  
+\;\gamma\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{topo}},  
$$  
where $x_t = x + \sigma_t\,\epsilon$.  

2.6 Training Algorithm  
Pseudo‐code for TopoVAE:  
1. Initialize $\phi,\theta$.  
2. For each epoch:  
   a. Sample batch $\{x_i\}$.  
   b. Compute latent codes $(\mu_i,\sigma_i)=E_\phi(x_i)$ and $z_i$.  
   c. Generate reconstructions $\hat x_i=G_\theta(z_i)$.  
   d. Extract $\Lambda^X,\Lambda^{\hat X}$ via TDA pipeline.  
   e. Compute $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VAE}}$ and backpropagate.  
3. Tune hyperparameters $\beta,\gamma,K$ via grid search.  

2.7 Experimental Design and Evaluation  
We design experiments to answer: (i) Does topology regularization improve interpolation? (ii) Does it enhance OOD detection? (iii) Does it increase adversarial robustness?  

Datasets and Baselines  
• MNIST, Fashion‐MNIST, CIFAR‐10 for image topology.  
• QM9 molecule datasets for chemical graph topology.  
• Synthetic torus and Swiss‐roll datasets for controlled topologies.  
• Baselines: standard VAE, $\beta$‐VAE, TopoDiffusionNet.  

Evaluation Metrics  
– Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) for image quality.  
– Interpolation Quality Index: average reconstruction error along linear and geodesic paths in latent space.  
– Bottleneck distance between persistence diagrams of data and generated samples.  
– Out‐of‐Distribution detection AUC using latent‐space thresholds.  
– Adversarial robustness: success rate of PGD attacks on latent codes.  

Ablation Studies  
• Vary $\gamma$ from 0 (no topo‐loss) to large values.  
• Compare landscape‐based vs. image‐based topological losses.  
• Evaluate computational overhead: runtime per epoch.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

3.1 Predicted Outcomes  
We anticipate that models trained with our topology‐aware regularizer will:  
• Exhibit latent interpolations that preserve cluster structure and loops, as measured by lower topological loss along interpolation paths.  
• Achieve comparable or improved FID scores—demonstrating that enforcing topology does not degrade sample quality.  
• Reduce the Bottleneck and Wasserstein distances between data and generation manifolds.  
• Attain higher OOD detection AUCs by virtue of a more semantically coherent latent embedding.  
• Resist adversarial latent perturbations more effectively, lowering attack success rates by up to 20 % relative to baselines.  

3.2 Scientific and Practical Impact  
Our framework provides a general mechanism to inject global manifold information into DGMs, bridging the gap between data topology and generative performance. Practically, this enables:  
• More reliable data augmentation pipelines for medical and scientific imaging where preserving topology (e.g., vessel loops, cellular structures) is critical.  
• Generative modeling for molecular and materials discovery with faithfulness to chemical graph topology.  
• Foundations for robust generative modeling in safety‐critical systems (autonomous vehicles, robotics), where adversarial resilience is essential.  

3.3 Future Extensions  
Beyond VAEs and diffusion, our approach can be adapted to GANs via a topological penalty on discriminator‐latent couplings. We also foresee applications in multimodal generation (text‐to‐image) by jointly regularizing the topology of cross‐modal latent alignments. Finally, we will release an open‐source library integrating persistence landscapes into PyTorch training loops, lowering the barrier to topology‐aware deep learning.  

In summary, by embedding topological invariants directly into the training of deep generative models, we chart a novel pathway toward more expressive, robust, and interpretable generative learning systems.
