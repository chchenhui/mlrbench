### Title: "Adversarial Robustness Enhancement in Deep Generative Models via Adversarial Training"

### Motivation:
The current state of deep generative models (DGMs) is hindered by their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, which can lead to the generation of low-quality or even harmful outputs. Enhancing the robustness of DGMs against adversarial inputs is crucial for their practical deployment in real-world applications, such as AI-assisted healthcare, autonomous systems, and content creation.

### Main Idea:
This research proposes a novel framework for enhancing the adversarial robustness of deep generative models through adversarial training. The methodology involves two key components:

1. **Adversarial Training**: Incorporate adversarial samples generated from a pre-trained model into the training process. These samples are created by adding small perturbations to the input data, thereby simulating potential adversarial attacks. This approach helps the model learn to generate robust outputs even in the presence of adversarial inputs.

2. **Robustness Metric Optimization**: Develop and optimize a novel robustness metric that evaluates the model's ability to generate high-quality outputs under adversarial conditions. This metric will guide the training process and ensure that the generated samples are not only realistic but also resilient to adversarial perturbations.

Expected outcomes include a more robust deep generative model that can handle adversarial inputs effectively, leading to improved sample quality and reliability. The potential impact is significant, as it will enhance the trustworthiness and practicality of DGMs in various application domains, including AI4Science and autonomous systems.
