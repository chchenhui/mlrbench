**Title:** Harmonizing Latent Manifolds for Robust and Interpretable Generative Modeling  

**Motivation:** Deep generative models often struggle to capture complex data distributions, leading to suboptimal sample quality, mode collapse, and instability. These issues arise partly due to mismatches between the latent space geometry and the true data manifold. Understanding and optimizing this alignment could improve both theoretical insights and practical deployment of generative models in critical areas like scientific discovery.  

**Main Idea:** This work proposes a novel manifold-aware regularization framework for training deep generative models (e.g., VAEs, GANs, or diffusion models). By incorporating differential geometric constraints (e.g., Ricci curvature bounds via optimal transport) during training, the latent space is encouraged to preserve structural properties of the data manifold, such as local distances and global topology. Specifically, we introduce a differentiable loss term that minimizes distortion between the latent prior and the learned data-induced metric. This regularizer leverages geometric operators (e.g., Laplace-Beltrami) to penalize deviations from the target manifoldâ€™s curvature, fostering smoother interpolations and robustness to adversarial perturbations. Supported by theoretical analysis of generalization bounds under geometric constraints, we demonstrate this framework enhances sample fidelity (via metrics like FID/SLIC) and interpretability (via visualization) on datasets like CIFAR-10, CelebA, and scientific data (e.g., molecular conformations). The approach bridges latent space theory with practical efficacy, directly addressing ICLR workshop themes of advancing DGM foundations and AI4Science applications.
