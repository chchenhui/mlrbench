# Manifold-Constrained Neural Motion Planning: A Geometric Approach to Robot Trajectory Generation

## Introduction

Motion planning is one of the foundational challenges in robotics, requiring robots to generate efficient, collision-free trajectories through complex environments while respecting kinematic and dynamic constraints. Traditional approaches to motion planning have generally fallen into two categories: sampling-based planners that explore configuration spaces through random sampling (e.g., RRT, PRM), and optimization-based approaches that formulate motion planning as a constrained optimization problem. While these methods have achieved considerable success, they often struggle with the computational complexity of high-dimensional configuration spaces and generalization to novel environments.

Recent advances in machine learning have opened new avenues for addressing these challenges. Learning-based motion planning approaches leverage data to improve sample efficiency and generalization capabilities. However, many of these approaches either ignore the geometric structure inherent in robotics or handle it through ad-hoc regularization, leading to physically implausible trajectories or poor sample efficiency.

The key insight driving this research is that robot configuration spaces are inherently structured geometric objects—manifolds with specific properties determined by the robot's kinematics and physical constraints. For instance, the configuration space of a mobile robot typically belongs to the Special Euclidean group SE(2), while a rigid body in 3D space belongs to SE(3). By explicitly incorporating this geometric structure as a prior into learning-based motion planning, we can significantly improve both the efficiency and quality of generated trajectories.

This research aims to develop a novel framework for motion planning that combines the strengths of geometric reasoning and deep learning, which we call Manifold-Constrained Neural Motion Planning (MCNMP). Our approach explicitly models the robot's configuration space as a Riemannian manifold and constrains trajectory generation to respect the intrinsic geometry of this manifold. By embedding geometric priors directly into neural network architectures and optimization processes, MCNMP ensures generated trajectories are physically plausible while maintaining computational efficiency.

The significance of this research is threefold. First, it addresses a fundamental challenge in robotics—the efficient generation of feasible motion plans in complex environments. Second, it bridges the gap between geometric approaches to robotics and modern deep learning techniques, potentially opening new directions for both fields. Finally, by improving the efficiency and reliability of motion planning, this research could enable more capable and autonomous robotic systems across various domains, from industrial automation to healthcare and service robotics.

## Methodology

Our proposed Manifold-Constrained Neural Motion Planning (MCNMP) framework consists of three main components: (1) a geometric encoder that maps workspace obstacles onto the robot's configuration space manifold, (2) a manifold-aware trajectory generator that produces paths constrained to geodesics on this manifold, and (3) a Riemannian optimization process that ensures physical feasibility. We detail each component below.

### 3.1 Problem Formulation

Let $\mathcal{M}$ denote the manifold representing the robot's configuration space (e.g., SE(2) for planar mobile robots, SE(3) for rigid bodies in 3D space). A motion planning problem is defined by:
- Initial configuration $q_{\text{init}} \in \mathcal{M}$
- Goal configuration $q_{\text{goal}} \in \mathcal{M}$
- Obstacle set $\mathcal{O} \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ representing regions to avoid
- Kinematic constraints $f(q, \dot{q}, \ddot{q}) \leq 0$

Our objective is to find a trajectory $\tau: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathcal{M}$ such that:
- $\tau(0) = q_{\text{init}}$ and $\tau(1) = q_{\text{goal}}$
- $\tau(t)$ is collision-free with respect to $\mathcal{O}$ for all $t \in [0,1]$
- $f(\tau(t), \dot{\tau}(t), \ddot{\tau}(t)) \leq 0$ for all $t \in [0,1]$
- $\tau$ minimizes a cost functional $J[\tau]$ that represents efficiency criteria (e.g., path length, energy, smoothness)

### 3.2 Geometric Encoder

The geometric encoder maps workspace obstacles $\mathcal{O}$ onto a latent representation in the robot's configuration space $\mathcal{M}$. This mapping is crucial as it transforms obstacle avoidance from a complex collision-checking problem to a geodesic finding problem on a manifold.

We implement the geometric encoder as an SE(3)-equivariant neural network $\mathcal{E}_{\theta}$ with parameters $\theta$. The equivariance property ensures that the encoding respects the symmetries of the physical space:

$$\mathcal{E}_{\theta}(g \cdot \mathcal{O}) = g \cdot \mathcal{E}_{\theta}(\mathcal{O}) \quad \forall g \in \text{SE}(3)$$

where $g \cdot$ represents the group action of SE(3) on the respective space.

The architecture of $\mathcal{E}_{\theta}$ consists of:
1. A voxel grid representation of the workspace
2. SE(3)-equivariant convolutional layers that extract geometric features
3. A manifold projection layer that maps these features to a metric on $\mathcal{M}$

The output of $\mathcal{E}_{\theta}$ is a Riemannian metric tensor field $G: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ (where $d$ is the dimension of $\mathcal{M}$) that encodes the "cost" of traversing different regions of the configuration space:

$$G(q) = \mathcal{E}_{\theta}(\mathcal{O})(q)$$

This metric tensor is designed such that regions in configuration space that would lead to collisions have high metric values, effectively making geodesics avoid these regions.

### 3.3 Manifold-Aware Trajectory Generator

Given the Riemannian metric tensor field $G$ produced by the geometric encoder, the trajectory generator computes a geodesic connecting $q_{\text{init}}$ and $q_{\text{goal}}$. We implement this as a neural network $\mathcal{G}_{\phi}$ with parameters $\phi$ that outputs a trajectory $\tau$ parameterized as a sequence of waypoints on $\mathcal{M}$.

To ensure that $\mathcal{G}_{\phi}$ produces trajectories that respect the manifold structure, we use a manifold-aware architecture that operates directly on $\mathcal{M}$ rather than in a Euclidean embedding space. Specifically, for a trajectory represented as $n$ waypoints, we have:

$$\tau = \mathcal{G}_{\phi}(q_{\text{init}}, q_{\text{goal}}, G) = \{q_0, q_1, \ldots, q_n\}$$

where $q_0 = q_{\text{init}}$, $q_n = q_{\text{goal}}$, and $q_i \in \mathcal{M}$ for all $i$.

To implement this, we use a recurrent neural network with manifold-constrained state transitions:

$$h_{i+1} = \text{RNN}_{\phi}(h_i, g_i)$$
$$q_{i+1} = \exp_{q_i}(V_i)$$

where $h_i$ is the hidden state, $g_i$ is a feature vector derived from the metric tensor $G$ at $q_i$, $V_i \in T_{q_i}\mathcal{M}$ is a tangent vector predicted from $h_{i+1}$, and $\exp_{q_i}$ is the exponential map at $q_i$ that ensures $q_{i+1}$ remains on the manifold $\mathcal{M}$.

### 3.4 Riemannian Optimization

To refine the trajectory produced by the trajectory generator, we employ Riemannian optimization directly on the manifold $\mathcal{M}$. This ensures that the trajectory satisfies all constraints while minimizing the cost functional.

We formulate the optimization problem as:

$$\min_{\tau} J[\tau] = \int_0^1 \left( \langle \dot{\tau}(t), G(\tau(t)) \dot{\tau}(t) \rangle + \lambda R[\tau(t)] \right) dt$$

subject to:
- $\tau(0) = q_{\text{init}}$ and $\tau(1) = q_{\text{goal}}$
- $f(\tau(t), \dot{\tau}(t), \ddot{\tau}(t)) \leq 0$ for all $t \in [0,1]$

where $R[\tau(t)]$ is a regularization term that encourages smoothness, and $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter.

To solve this optimization problem on the manifold, we use Riemannian gradient descent:

$$\tau_{k+1} = \exp_{\tau_k}(-\alpha \nabla_R J[\tau_k])$$

where $\nabla_R J[\tau_k]$ is the Riemannian gradient of $J$ at $\tau_k$, $\alpha$ is the learning rate, and $\exp_{\tau_k}$ is the exponential map along the entire trajectory.

For computational efficiency, we discretize the trajectory and implement the Riemannian optimization using automatic differentiation through the exponential and logarithmic maps of the specific manifold $\mathcal{M}$.

### 3.5 Training Procedure

We train our model end-to-end using a dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(q_{\text{init}}^{(i)}, q_{\text{goal}}^{(i)}, \mathcal{O}^{(i)}, \tau^{(i)*})\}_{i=1}^N$ of motion planning problems and their optimal solutions. The loss function combines several terms:

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{path}} + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{collision}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{kinematics}} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{regularization}}$$

where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{path}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N d_{\mathcal{M}}(\tau^{(i)}, \tau^{(i)*})$ measures the discrepancy between generated and optimal trajectories using an appropriate distance metric $d_{\mathcal{M}}$ on the manifold
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{collision}}$ penalizes collisions with obstacles
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{kinematics}}$ enforces kinematic constraints
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{regularization}}$ encourages smoothness and efficiency

To handle the manifold constraints during training, we utilize Riemannian optimization techniques and ensure all operations (such as gradient updates) respect the manifold structure.

### 3.6 Experimental Design

We will evaluate MCNMP on a variety of motion planning scenarios, comparing it against both traditional and learning-based approaches. Our experiments will include:

1. **Planar Navigation**: A mobile robot navigating through cluttered 2D environments (SE(2) manifold)

3. **Path Quality**: Measured by path length, smoothness, and clearance from obstacles
4. **Generalization**: Performance on novel environments not seen during training
5. **Geometric Consistency**: Adherence to manifold constraints and kinematic feasibility

We will also conduct ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each component of our framework:
- Geometric encoder without equivariance
- Trajectory generator without manifold constraints
- Traditional optimization without Riemannian structure
