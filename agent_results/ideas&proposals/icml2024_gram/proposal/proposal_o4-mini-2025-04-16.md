1. Title  
“Manifold-Constrained Trajectory Generation via SE(3)-Equivariant Geometric Priors for Learning-Based Motion Planning”

2. Introduction  
Background  
Motion planning for robotic systems requires finding collision-free, feasible trajectories in high-dimensional configuration spaces (e.g., SE(2), SE(3), or SO(3) manifolds). Classical sampling-based planners (RRT*, PRM) explore these spaces exhaustively, incurring high computational cost and often failing to generalize to novel environments. Recently, learning-based planners have emerged that leverage generative models (e.g., diffusion priors, variational Gaussian processes, Stein variational inference) to accelerate planning. However, many of these methods neglect the underlying geometric structure of configuration spaces, relying on Euclidean parameterizations or ad‐hoc regularization to enforce feasibility.

Motivation & Significance  
All configuration spaces of rigid‐body systems carry natural manifold structures and symmetry groups (e.g., SE(3) for 6-DOF manipulators). Embedding these geometric priors directly into neural architectures can:  
• Preserve symmetry and equivariance under group operations, improving sample efficiency and generalization.  
• Guarantee that learned trajectories remain on the manifold, reducing the need for expensive post-processing or constraint-handling.  
• Provide physically plausible paths by construction, respecting kinematic and workspace geometry.

Research Objectives  
1. Design a two-stage, geometry-grounded neural framework that:  
   a. Encodes workspace obstacles into a manifold latent representation using SE(3)-equivariant layers.  
   b. Generates collision‐free trajectories as geodesics on the robot’s configuration manifold via Riemannian optimization.  
2. Formulate loss functions that integrate obstacle avoidance, smoothness, and manifold constraints in a fully differentiable manner.  
3. Evaluate the planner on a variety of simulated and real‐robot benchmarks, comparing against state-of-the‐art sampling-based and learning-based methods.  

3. Methodology  

3.1 Problem Formulation  
We consider a robot whose configuration space is a smooth Riemannian manifold $(\mathcal M,g)$, e.g.  
• SE(2) for planar mobile robots  
• SE(3) for full rigid‐body poses  
Let $q \in \mathcal M$ denote a configuration. A trajectory is a time-parameterized curve $\gamma:[0,1]\to\mathcal M$ with $\gamma(0)=q_{\rm start}$ and $\gamma(1)=q_{\rm goal}$. The workspace contains obstacles $\mathcal O\subset\mathbb R^3$, represented as point clouds or signed‐distance fields.

We aim to learn a mapping  
$$
\Phi:\bigl(q_{\rm start},q_{\rm goal},\,\mathcal O\bigr)\;\mapsto\;\gamma(t)
$$  
such that $\gamma(t)\in\mathcal M$ is smooth, collision‐free, and close to the manifold geodesic between $q_{\rm start}$ and $q_{\rm goal}$.

3.2 Geometric Encoder  
Input Representation  
• Workspace obstacles $\mathcal O$ are downsampled to point-cloud $P=\{x_i\in\mathbb R^3\}_{i=1}^N$.  
• Start/goal configurations $q_{\rm start},q_{\rm goal}$ are represented by elements of SE(3).

SE(3)-Equivariant Graph Neural Network  
1. Construct a graph $G=(V,E)$ over $P$ using k-nearest neighbors.  
2. At each layer $\ell$, compute features $h_i^{(\ell)}\in\mathbb R^d$ and $v_i^{(\ell)}\in\mathbb R^3$ that transform under SE(3) group actions:  
   $$h_i^{(\ell+1)} = \sum_{j\in\mathcal N(i)} W_h\,h_j^{(\ell)} + b_h,$$  
   $$v_i^{(\ell+1)} = R\,v_j^{(\ell)} + (t+W_v\,h_j^{(\ell)})$$  
   where $(R,t)\in$ SE(3) acts on vectors and scalars as prescribed by steerable‐CNN theory.  
3. After $L$ layers, aggregate node features into a global descriptor $z\in\mathbb R^D$ via an invariant pooling operator (e.g., sum or Fréchet mean on the manifold).  
4. Form latent code  
   $$\mathbf z = \mathrm{MLP}([z;\,q_{\rm start};\,q_{\rm goal}])$$  
   which seeds the trajectory generator.

3.3 Geodesic Trajectory Generator  
Parameterization  
We represent $\gamma(t)$ by a control‐point parameterization on the manifold: choose $K$ points $\{p_k\}_{k=0}^K\subset\mathcal M$ with $p_0=q_{\rm start},\,p_K=q_{\rm goal}$. Intermediate points $p_k$ are initialized along the manifold‐logarithmic path:  
$$
v = \log_{q_{\rm start}}(q_{\rm goal}),\quad
p_k = \exp_{q_{\rm start}}\bigl(\tfrac{k}{K}v\bigr).
$$  

Neural Update  
A recurrent neural unit updates each $p_k$ as  
$$
p_k^{(t+1)} = \exp_{p_k^{(t)}}\Bigl(\mathrm{ResNet}\bigl([\log_{p_k^{(t)}}(p_{k-1}^{(t)}),\,\log_{p_k^{(t)}}(p_{k+1}^{(t)}),\,\mathbf z]\bigr)\Bigr).
$$  
Here $\exp$/$\log$ denote the Riemannian exponential and logarithm maps on $\mathcal M$.

Loss Functions  
We jointly optimize the following terms:  
1. Obstacle‐Avoidance Loss  
   $$L_{\rm obs} = \sum_{k=0}^K \max\bigl(0,\,d_{\mathcal O}(p_k) - \delta_{\rm safe}\bigr)^2,$$  
   where $d_{\mathcal O}(p)=\min_{x\in P}\|T(p)\ominus x\|_2$ is the distance from configuration $p$ to obstacles in workspace and $\delta_{\rm safe}$ is a safety margin.  
2. Smoothness Loss  
   $$L_{\rm smooth} = \sum_{k=1}^K \bigl\|\log_{p_{k-1}}(p_{k})\bigr\|^2_g$$  
   enforces curve regularity under Riemannian metric $g$.  
3. Geodesic Deviation Loss  
   $$L_{\rm geo} = \sum_{k=0}^K \bigl\|\log_{p_k}(p_{k+1}) - \tfrac{1}{K}v\bigr\|^2_g,$$  
   encouraging the learned path to stay near the geodesic.  
Total loss  
$$
L = \alpha\,L_{\rm obs} + \beta\,L_{\rm smooth} + \gamma\,L_{\rm geo},
$$  
with weights $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ chosen by cross‐validation.

3.4 Data Collection and Training  
• Synthetic Environments: Randomly generate obstacle fields in 2D and 3D workspaces (boxes, cylinders, walls). For each, sample $(q_{\rm start},q_{\rm goal})$ pairs and compute ground‐truth shortest‐path geodesics and collision‐free trajectories via RRT* or CHOMP as demonstration data.  
• Real‐Robot Scenes: Capture obstacle point clouds using an RGB-D sensor around a UR5 manipulator; sample tasks such as pick-and-place in clutter.  
• Dataset Size: 100k trajectories in simulation (split 80/10/10 for train/val/test), 5k real-robot demonstrations.  

Training Protocol  
• Optimizer: Riemannian Adam with manifold‐aware gradient updates.  
• Learning Rate: $1e^{-3}$, decayed on plateau.  
• Batch Size: 32 trajectories.  
• Training Epochs: 200 with early stopping on validation loss.

• Real-robot trials on a UR5 and a differential-drive mobile base in a cluttered lab. Each trial comprises 50 unique start/goal pairs over 10 obstacle layouts.  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate that our geometry-grounded framework will:  
• Reduce planning time by 50–60% relative to classical sampling methods, and by 30% relative to recent diffusion and GP planners.  
• Achieve success rates above 95% on both seen and unseen environments, outperforming baselines by 10–15%.  
• Produce trajectories whose average clearance and smoothness metrics exceed those of learned baselines by 20%.  
• Demonstrate strong generalization to new obstacle types (e.g., moving obstacles) without retraining.  

Scientific Impact  
• Unification of equivariant representation learning and Riemannian trajectory optimization in a single, end-to-end trainable framework.  
• New insights into embedding manifold priors via neural architectures, applicable to other robotics tasks (e.g., control, state estimation).  
• Publicly released code, models, and benchmarks to drive further research in geometry-grounded motion planning.

Broader Impacts  
• Enhanced autonomy for service robots in homes, warehouses, and healthcare settings, where fast and reliable planning is critical.  
• Reduced computational resources, enabling deployment on low-power embedded platforms.  
• Foundation for safety‐critical applications (e.g., surgical robotics, autonomous vehicles) through built-in geometric guarantees.

5. Conclusion & Future Work  
We have proposed a novel, geometry-grounded approach to robotic motion planning that directly leverages manifold structure and symmetry through SE(3)-equivariant encoding and Riemannian trajectory generation. By formulating loss functions that encode obstacle avoidance, smoothness, and geodesic adherence, our method learns to produce high-quality, collision-free trajectories faster and with stronger generalization than existing approaches.  

Future directions include:  
• Dynamic and multi-agent environments: Extend obstacle‐avoidance losses to time-varying scenes and group planning.  
• Integration with diffusion priors: Combine manifold optimization with stochastic samplers for multimodal trajectory distributions.  
• Physics-informed constraints: Incorporate dynamics (e.g., torque limits, friction models) via PINN-style losses.  
• Real-time online replanning: Adapt the framework for fully incremental, streaming inputs.  

Through this work, we aim to set a new standard for geometry-grounded representation learning in robotics and catalyze further advances at the intersection of differential geometry and machine learning.
