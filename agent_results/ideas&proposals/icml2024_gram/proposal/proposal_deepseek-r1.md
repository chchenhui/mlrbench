### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Motion planning in robotics involves computing collision-free, efficient trajectories in high-dimensional configuration spaces while respecting physical constraints. Traditional sampling-based methods (e.g., RRT*, PRM) suffer from computational inefficiency in complex environments, while learning-based approaches often lack generalization to novel scenarios or fail to encode geometric/physical constraints. Recent advances in geometric deep learning (e.g., equivariant networks, Riemannian optimization) offer a promising direction to address these challenges by embedding domain-specific priors directly into model architectures. By leveraging the inherent geometric structure of robot configuration spaces (e.g., SE(3) for rigid-body motion), we can induce physically plausible trajectories while improving sample efficiency and generalization.

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal aims to:  
1. Develop a **manifold-aware motion planning framework** that encodes geometric priors through SE(3)-equivariant operations and Riemannian optimization.  
2. Formulate motion planning as **constrained optimization on manifolds**, ensuring trajectories follow geodesics in the robot’s configuration space.  
3. Validate the framework’s ability to generalize across environments and robot morphologies while reducing planning time by 60% compared to sampling-based baselines.  

**Significance**  
The integration of geometric priors bridges the gap between classical geometric motion planning and modern learning-based methods. By preserving physical constraints at the architectural level, the proposed approach will:  
- Improve robustness in novel environments.  
- Enable real-time planning for high-degree-of-freedom robots.  
- Provide theoretical insights into structure-inducing learning for robotics.

### 3. **Methodology**  
**Research Design**  
The framework comprises two stages: a **geometric encoder** and a **manifold-constrained trajectory generator** (Fig. 1).

*Fig. 1: Two-stage architecture mapping workspace obstacles to geodesic trajectories on the robot’s configuration manifold.*

#### **Stage 1: Geometric Encoder**  
**Data Collection**  
- **Input**: Point clouds of workspace obstacles (from LiDAR/RGB-D sensors) and robot kinematics.  
- **Training Data**: Synthetic datasets generated in PyBullet and MuJoCo for diverse environments (cluttered scenes, dynamic obstacles) and robot morphologies (mobile bases, manipulators).  

**SE(3)-Equivariant Obstacle Encoding**  
The encoder maps obstacles to the robot’s configuration space manifold $\mathcal{M} \subseteq \text{SE}(3)$ using equivariant layers. For a point cloud $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 3}$, the encoder applies:  
1. **Steerable CNN**: Processes $\mathbf{X}$ with SE(3)-equivariant convolutions:  
   $$
   f_{\text{enc}}(\mathbf{X}) = \sigma\left(\mathbf{W} \star_{\text{SE(3)}} \mathbf{X} + \mathbf{b}\right),
   $$  
   where $\star_{\text{SE(3)}}$ denotes group-equivariant convolution.  
2. **Manifold Projection**: Outputs a latent representation $\mathbf{z} \in \mathcal{M}$ using the Fréchet mean:  
   $$
   \mathbf{z} = \arg\min_{\mathbf{z}' \in \mathcal{M}} \sum_{i=1}^N d_{\mathcal{M}}^2(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{z}'),
   $$  
   where $d_{\mathcal{M}}$ is the geodesic distance on $\mathcal{M}$.  

#### **Stage 2: Trajectory Generator**  
**Riemannian Optimization for Geodesic Paths**  
Given start and goal configurations $\mathbf{q}_s, \mathbf{q}_g \in \mathcal{M}$, the generator solves:  
$$
\min_{\mathbf{q}(t)} \int_0^T \left\lVert \nabla_{\dot{\mathbf{q}}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} \right\rVert^2 dt \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \mathbf{q}(0) = \mathbf{q}_s, \mathbf{q}(T) = \mathbf{q}_g,
$$  
where $\nabla_{\dot{\mathbf{q}}}$ is the covariant derivative. This is discretized into $K$ waypoints $\{\mathbf{q}_k\}_{k=1}^K$ and optimized via:  
1. **Geodesic Loss**:  
   $$
   L_{\text{geo}} = \sum_{k=1}^{K-1} d_{\mathcal{M}}(\mathbf{q}_k, \mathbf{q}_{k+1}).
   $$  
2. **Collision Avoidance**: Penalize penetration into obstacles using signed distance fields (SDFs):  
   $$
   L_{\text{obs}} = \sum_{k=1}^K \max\left(0, -\text{SDF}(\mathbf{q}_k)\right).
   $$  
3. **Kinematic Feasibility**: Enforce joint limits and velocity constraints via Lagrangian multipliers.  

**Differentiable Optimization**  
The trajectory generator employs a differentiable Riemannian optimizer based on [8], using retractions and parallel transport to update waypoints on $\mathcal{M}$:  
$$
\mathbf{q}_{k+1} = \text{Retr}_{\mathbf{q}_k}\left(-\eta \, \text{PT}_{\mathbf{q}_k \to \mathbf{q}_{k+1}}(\nabla L)\right),
$$  
where $\text{Retr}$ is the retraction operator and $\text{PT}$ denotes parallel transport.  

#### **Experimental Design**  
**Baselines**  
- **Sampling-Based**: RRT*, PRM.  
- **Learning-Based**: Motion Planning Diffusion [1], RMPflow [4], Stein Variational PRM [3].  

**Evaluation Metrics**  
1. **Planning Time**: Wall-clock time to generate a feasible trajectory.  
2. **Success Rate**: Percentage of collision-free trajectories in novel environments.  
3. **Path Length**: Geodesic distance normalized by optimal path.  
4. **Constraint Satisfaction**: Joint limit violations, obstacle clearance.  

**Datasets**  
- **Training**: 10,000 synthetic environments with varying obstacle densities.  
- **Testing**: 1,000 unseen environments, including dynamic obstacles.  

**Implementation**  
- **Framework**: PyTorch with GeoOpt [8] for Riemannian optimization.  
- **Robots**: 7-DOF manipulator (SE(3)), differential-drive mobile base (SE(2)).

**Broader Implications**  
By embedding geometric structure into learning architectures, this work will advance the design of **physically grounded AI systems** capable of reasoning about the 3D world—a critical step toward robust, generalizable robotic intelligence.
