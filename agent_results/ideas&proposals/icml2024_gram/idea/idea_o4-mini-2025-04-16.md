Title: Equivariant Score-Based Generative Modeling on Lie Groups

Motivation:  
Many applications—molecular conformer generation, 3D shape synthesis, robotics pose planning—require sampling from distributions that live on non-Euclidean manifolds with intrinsic symmetries. Standard generative models ignore these geometric constraints and produce invalid or non-equivariant samples. A symmetry-aware diffusion framework can ensure both validity and data efficiency.

Main Idea:  
We propose a score-based diffusion model defined directly on Lie groups (e.g., SO(3), SE(3)).  
• Forward process: simulate Brownian motion on the group via its exponential map and intrinsic Riemannian metric.  
• Score estimation: train a neural network that takes noisy group elements and outputs the Riemannian gradient of log-density (the “score”), enforcing equivariance by construction through group convolutional layers.  
• Sampling: perform denoising via Riemannian Langevin dynamics, iteratively applying exponential-map updates guided by the learned score.  
Expected outcomes include high-fidelity, symmetry-respecting samples of molecular rotamers and articulated shapes, with fewer training samples and improved generalization across group actions. This framework unifies manifold diffusion and equivariant architectures, offering a principled path to geometry-grounded generative modeling.
