### Title: Equivariant Convolutional Networks for Geometry-grounded Representation Learning in Medical Imaging

### Motivation
Medical imaging data, such as MRI and CT scans, inherently possess geometric structures that can be leveraged to improve representation learning and generative modeling. Current methods often fail to capture these structures, leading to suboptimal performance and limited generalization. By preserving geometric symmetries and transformation invariances, equivariant convolutional networks can enhance the interpretability and robustness of medical image analysis models.

### Main Idea
The primary research idea is to develop equivariant convolutional neural networks (ECNNs) tailored for medical imaging data. These networks will utilize geometric symmetries, such as rotations and translations, to learn invariant features. The methodology involves designing equivariant layers that maintain these symmetries, ensuring that the learned representations are robust to geometric transformations. We will explore the application of ECNNs in various medical imaging tasks, including segmentation, classification, and reconstruction.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved performance and robustness of medical image analysis models.
- Enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.
- Potential to reduce data requirements and computational costs.

Potential impact:
- Advancements in diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning in medical imaging.
- Enabling more efficient and effective use of medical imaging data in research and clinical settings.
- Contributing to the broader field of geometry-grounded representation learning by demonstrating the practical benefits of equivariant architectures in real-world applications.
