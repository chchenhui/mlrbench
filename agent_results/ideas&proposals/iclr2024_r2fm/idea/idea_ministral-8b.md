### Title: Enhancing Foundation Model Reliability via Multi-Modal Data Augmentation

### Motivation
Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized various domains, yet their reliability and responsibility remain significant challenges. Ensuring FMs are reliable and responsible is crucial for their effective deployment in critical applications like healthcare and finance. Current methods often overlook the potential of multi-modal data augmentation to improve FM reliability, which can mitigate issues such as hallucinations and prompt sensitivity.

### Main Idea
This research proposes a novel approach to enhance the reliability of FMs by leveraging multi-modal data augmentation. The methodology involves integrating diverse data modalities (e.g., text, images, audio) to create a more robust training dataset. This approach aims to address the following:

1. **Methodology**:
   - Collect and preprocess multi-modal datasets that are relevant to the target application.
   - Develop a data augmentation technique that combines and transforms data from different modalities.
   - Fine-tune the FM using the augmented multi-modal dataset.
   - Evaluate the FM's performance on reliability benchmarks, including prompt sensitivity and non-factuality tests.

2. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - Improved reliability and reduced hallucinations in FMs.
   - Enhanced self-consistency and better handling of spurious features.
   - Increased robustness to diverse input types and contexts.

3. **Potential Impact**:
   - Increased trust and adoption of FMs in critical applications.
   - Better alignment of FMs with human values and societal norms.
   - Contribution to the development of more reliable and responsible next-generation FMs.

By focusing on multi-modal data augmentation, this research offers a practical and innovative solution to enhance the reliability of foundation models, addressing a critical need in the current AI landscape.
