**Title:** Domain-Guided Fine-Tuning for Enhancing Factuality and Reducing Hallucinations in Foundation Models  

**Motivation:** Foundation models (FMs) in high-stakes domains like healthcare and drug discovery require stringent reliability to prevent harmful outcomes from factual inaccuracies or hallucinations. Current fine-tuning methods often fail to systematically integrate domain-specific knowledge, leading to outputs that violate established scientific principles or safety constraints. Addressing this gap is critical to enable trustworthy AI adoption in specialized fields.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a fine-tuning framework that embeds domain knowledge (e.g., biomedical databases, molecular interaction rules) directly into FMs via constrained optimization and knowledge-aware loss functions. For instance, in drug discovery, the modelâ€™s outputs would be penalized for generating molecules with unsafe functional groups or unverified binding properties. The methodology includes:  
1. **Knowledge integration:** Encoding domain rules as differentiable constraints or attention biases during training.  
2. **Validation loops:** Iteratively verifying outputs against domain-specific databases to refine model behavior.  
3. **Adaptive regularization:** Balancing generality and specificity to avoid overfitting to narrow rules.  

Expected outcomes include measurable reductions in hallucinations (e.g., via factuality benchmarks) and improved alignment with domain standards. The impact would be safer, more reliable FMs for critical applications, bridging the gap between broad pretraining and specialized, responsible deployment.
