# Detecting Hallucinations in Foundation Models: A Self-Consistency Framework

## Motivation
Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly used in critical domains like healthcare and legal applications, yet they can produce "hallucinations" - generating false information presented as factual. These hallucinations threaten reliability, potentially leading to harmful outcomes when users trust incorrect information. Existing detection methods often rely on external knowledge bases, which may be incomplete or outdated, especially for specialized domains. A self-contained approach that doesn't depend on external verification is urgently needed to enhance FM trustworthiness.

## Main Idea
I propose a novel self-consistency framework for hallucination detection that leverages the inherent capabilities of foundation models themselves. The approach introduces multi-perspective querying: reframing a single information request in diverse ways (e.g., factual, counterfactual, temporal variations) and analyzing consistency across responses. The framework employs a specialized verification model trained on agreement patterns in validated information versus hallucinated content. By examining both semantic consistency and logical coherence across responses, the system generates a "confidence score" reflecting hallucination probability. This method is domain-adaptive, requiring minimal specialized data, and can operate as a preprocessing layer before content delivery. Implementation would significantly reduce misinformation propagation while maintaining model utility, making FMs more reliable for high-stakes applications.
