# Intervention-Based Causal Pruning for Enhancing Reliability in Foundation Models

## 1. Introduction

Foundation Models (FMs) have emerged as transformative forces in artificial intelligence, enabling unprecedented capabilities across domains from natural language processing to computer vision. These large-scale models, trained on vast corpora of data, have demonstrated remarkable performance on diverse tasks. However, their reliance on massive, noisy training data often leads to the internalization of spurious correlations—relationships that appear valid in training data but fail to generalize to new contexts. This phenomenon manifests as hallucinations, biased outputs, and poor out-of-distribution generalization, undermining the reliability and responsibility of these powerful systems.

As FMs increasingly influence critical decisions in healthcare, finance, education, and other domains, ensuring their reliability becomes paramount. Current approaches to improving FM reliability often focus on architectural innovations or dataset curation but rarely address the causal mechanisms through which spurious features influence model predictions. The challenge is particularly acute because these spurious correlations are often deeply embedded within model parameters and difficult to isolate using conventional techniques.

This research proposes a novel framework—Intervention-Based Causal Pruning (ICP)—that leverages causal inference principles to identify and mitigate spurious features in foundation models. By systematically intervening on internal model representations and observing the resulting changes in output distributions, we can quantify the causal influence of specific features on model behaviors and selectively prune or reweight those that contribute to unreliable predictions.

Our research objectives are threefold:
1. Develop a scalable methodology for causal feature attribution in foundation models through targeted interventions
2. Design an intervention-guided pruning and reweighting mechanism to attenuate spurious correlations
3. Evaluate the impact of our approach on model reliability, fairness, and generalization across diverse tasks

The significance of this research lies in its potential to address a fundamental challenge in AI safety and alignment. By providing a principled approach to identifying and mitigating spurious correlations, we can enhance the reliability of foundation models in real-world applications, improve their generalization capabilities, and reduce harmful biases. Furthermore, the causal perspective offers interpretability benefits, allowing stakeholders to better understand model behaviors and limitations.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed Intervention-Based Causal Pruning (ICP) framework consists of two primary components: (1) causal attribution through targeted interventions and (2) intervention-guided pruning and reweighting. The approach is model-agnostic and can be applied to various foundation model architectures, including transformer-based language models and vision-language models.

### 2.1 Causal Attribution through Targeted Interventions

To identify spurious features in foundation models, we employ a causal intervention approach inspired by Pearl's do-calculus. Unlike traditional feature attribution methods that measure correlational relationships, our approach quantifies the causal effect of internal representations on model outputs.

Let $M$ represent a foundation model with parameters $\theta$, input $x$, and output $y = M_\theta(x)$. We denote the set of internal activations at layer $l$ as $h_l = [h_{l,1}, h_{l,2}, ..., h_{l,n}]$, where $n$ is the dimensionality of the layer. Our goal is to measure the causal effect of each activation $h_{l,i}$ on the model's output.

For each activation $h_{l,i}$, we perform three types of interventions:

1. **Masking**: Replace $h_{l,i}$ with zeros:
   $$do(h_{l,i} = 0)$$

2. **Scaling**: Multiply $h_{l,i}$ by a factor $\alpha$:
   $$do(h_{l,i} = \alpha \cdot h_{l,i})$$

3. **Swapping**: Replace $h_{l,i}$ with the corresponding activation from a different input $x'$:
   $$do(h_{l,i} = h'_{l,i})$$

For each intervention, we compute the model output and measure the effect on target metrics such as factual correctness, consistency, or fairness. Formally, we define the causal effect of feature $h_{l,i}$ on output metric $m$ as:

$$CE(h_{l,i}, m) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim X} [m(M_\theta(x)) - m(M_\theta(x | do(h_{l,i} = v)))]$$

where $v$ is the intervention value (0, $\alpha \cdot h_{l,i}$, or $h'_{l,i}$), and $X$ is a diverse dataset sampled from the target distribution.

To identify spurious features, we compute a "spuriousness score" for each activation based on its causal effects across different intervention types and datasets:

$$S(h_{l,i}) = \frac{1}{|I| \cdot |M| \cdot |X|} \sum_{I} \sum_{m \in M} \sum_{x \in X} w_I \cdot w_m \cdot |CE(h_{l,i}, m)|$$

where $I$ is the set of intervention types, $M$ is the set of metrics, and $w_I$ and $w_m$ are weights assigned to different intervention types and metrics, respectively.

We calculate these scores across multiple datasets, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples, to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential spurious correlations.

### 2.2 Intervention-Guided Pruning and Reweighting

Once we have identified and scored spurious features, we employ a two-step approach to mitigate their influence on model outputs:

1. **Structural Pruning**: For features with high spuriousness scores exceeding a threshold $\tau$, we prune the corresponding weights in the model. Specifically, for feature $h_{l,i}$ with $S(h_{l,i}) > \tau$, we modify the weights connecting this feature to the next layer:

   $$\theta_{l+1,j,i} = 0 \quad \forall j \text{ if } S(h_{l,i}) > \tau$$

2. **Contrastive Fine-tuning**: We fine-tune the pruned model using a contrastive objective that encourages invariance to spurious features. For each training example $(x, y)$, we generate a counterfactual example $(x', y)$ by intervening on the identified spurious features:

   $$x' = M^{-1}(M(x | do(h_{l,i} = v))) \quad \forall i \text{ with } S(h_{l,i}) > \tau_c$$

   where $M^{-1}$ is an approximate inverse of the model mapping outputs back to inputs (e.g., using gradient-based optimization or learned inversion models), and $\tau_c$ is a threshold for contrastive example generation.

   We then fine-tune the model using the following contrastive loss:

   $$\mathcal{L}_{contrastive} = \mathcal{L}_{task}(M_\theta(x), y) + \lambda \cdot D_{KL}(M_\theta(x) || M_\theta(x'))$$

   where $\mathcal{L}_{task}$ is the task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification), $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter controlling the strength of the contrastive term.

To further enhance the effectiveness of our approach, we implement an iterative process where feature attribution and pruning/reweighting are performed multiple times, with each iteration refining the identification of spurious features and improving the model's reliability.

### 2.3 Experimental Design and Evaluation

To validate the effectiveness of our Intervention-Based Causal Pruning approach, we design a comprehensive evaluation framework across three different settings:

1. **Open-domain Question Answering (Factual Reliability)**
   - **Datasets**: Natural Questions, TruthfulQA, and HotpotQA
   - **Base models**: GPT-3.5, LLaMA-2 (7B and 13B), and T5-Large
   - **Metrics**: 
     - Accuracy on factual questions
     - Hallucination rate (measured using expert-annotated datasets)
     - Calibration (expected vs. actual accuracy)
     - Out-of-distribution generalization (temporal splits and domain shifts)
   - **Baselines**: Fine-tuning without pruning, RLHF, Chain-of-Thought prompting, and Self-consistency ensembling

2. **Sentiment Analysis under Domain Shift (Robustness)**
   - **Datasets**: Amazon Reviews, Yelp Reviews, and IMDb, with cross-domain evaluations
   - **Base models**: RoBERTa-Large, BERT-Large, and domain-adapted variants
   - **Metrics**:
     - Cross-domain accuracy
     - Area under domain-shift curve
     - Feature reliance metrics (measuring dependence on spurious features)
   - **Baselines**: Domain adaptation methods, adversarial training, and data augmentation techniques

3. **Bias and Fairness Evaluation (Responsibility)**
   - **Datasets**: CrowS-Pairs, StereoSet, and BOLD
   - **Base models**: All models from previous experiments
   - **Metrics**:
     - Demographic parity
     - Equal opportunity
     - Bias amplification
     - Sensitivity to protected attributes
   - **Baselines**: Bias mitigation techniques, counterfactual data augmentation, and fairness-aware fine-tuning

For each task, we implement the following experimental procedure:
1. Perform causal attribution on the pre-trained model to identify spurious features
2. Apply pruning and reweighting according to the identified features
3. Fine-tune the pruned model on task-specific data with the contrastive objective
4. Evaluate the resulting model on in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets

To ensure statistical robustness, we repeat each experiment with five different random seeds and report mean and standard deviation for all metrics. We also conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component of our approach:
1. Intervention types (masking, scaling, swapping)
2. Pruning vs. reweighting
3. Contrastive fine-tuning with and without pruning
4. Effect of thresholds $\tau$ and $\tau_c$
5. Layer-wise analysis of pruned features

Furthermore, we analyze the computational efficiency of our approach compared to baselines, measuring the additional training time, memory requirements, and inference latency introduced by our method.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### 3.3 Potential Limitations and Mitigations

We acknowledge several potential limitations of our approach and propose corresponding mitigation strategies:

1. **Computational Complexity**: Performing interventions on all activations across layers could be computationally expensive. We will address this by developing efficient sampling strategies and leveraging sparsity in the intervention space.

2. **Model-Specific Calibration**: The effectiveness of interventions may vary across architectures. We will develop adaptive techniques that calibrate intervention strategies based on model architecture and pre-training objectives.

3. **Incomplete Spurious Feature Identification**: Some spurious correlations might be distributed across multiple features in complex ways. We will extend our framework to consider feature interactions and higher-order effects.

4. **Potential Performance Trade-offs**: Aggressively pruning spurious features might impact model performance on in-distribution data. We will carefully balance reliability gains against potential performance losses through hyperparameter tuning.

5. **Human Evaluation Biases**: Evaluating "factuality" or "bias" inherently involves human judgments that may themselves contain biases. We will employ diverse evaluation panels and leverage multiple complementary metrics to mitigate this concern.

By addressing these limitations, we aim to develop a robust and practical framework that significantly advances the reliability and responsibility of foundation models, contributing to the broader goal of aligning powerful AI systems with human values.
