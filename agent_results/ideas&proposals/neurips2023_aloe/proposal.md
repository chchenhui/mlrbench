## **1. Title: LLM-Guided Adaptive Curriculum Generation for Sustained Agent Learning in Open-Ended Environments**

## **2. Introduction**

**2.1. Background**
The fields of deep reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) have independently achieved remarkable success in enabling artificial agents to master complex sequential decision-making tasks (Sutton & Barto, 2018; Brown et al., 2020). RL agents can learn sophisticated control policies in simulated and real-world environments, while LLMs exhibit impressive capabilities in natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning, increasingly taking direct actions in digital and physical spaces (OpenAI, 2023). However, a fundamental limitation persists: traditional training paradigms typically focus on agents mastering a predefined, fixed set of tasks. Once mastery is achieved, the learning process often stagnates, falling short of the continuous adaptation and skill acquisition observed in natural intelligence (Stanley & Lehman, 2015).

The natural world presents an effectively unbounded stream of novel challenges, driving an open-ended evolutionary and developmental process. Organisms must continually adapt and acquire new skills to survive and thrive. This inherently open-ended dynamic is believed to be crucial for the emergence of general intelligence (Stanley et al., 2019). Mimicking this process in artificial systems, known as open-ended learning (OEL), holds the potential to develop agents with significantly broader capabilities, enhanced robustness, and improved generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios, including the critical sim2real transfer challenge (Jiang, 2023). The Agent Learning in Open-Endedness (ALOE) workshop highlights the urgent need to understand and develop systems that can kickstart and sustain such open-ended learning dynamics, especially in the era of large generative models which themselves participate in and shape complex, evolving ecosystems like the web.

A key challenge in OEL is the generation of appropriate challenges â€“ tasks that are neither too easy (leading to boredom) nor too hard (leading to stagnation), but lie at the "edge" of an agent's current competence, thereby driving meaningful learning (Wang et al., 2019). Manually designing such curricula is extremely labor-intensive, requires domain expertise, and often fails to anticipate the emergent complexities and failure modes that truly push an agent's capabilities (Portelas et al., 2020). Recent work has explored automated curriculum generation, including Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) which aims to automatically generate environments matched to agent capabilities (Jiang, 2023), and Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques (Dennis et al., 2020). Concurrently, LLMs are demonstrating potential in structuring complex processes, including curriculum design for RL in specific domains like robotics (Ryu et al., 2024) and mobile networks (Erak et al., 2024). However, leveraging LLMs to dynamically generate *adaptive* curricula based *specifically on an agent's ongoing failures and successes* within a broader OEL framework remains a promising yet underexplored direction.

**2.2. Research Objectives**
This research proposes a novel framework, **L**LM-driven **A**daptive **C**urriculum for **O**pen-ended **L**earning (**LACOL**), where an LLM acts as a meta-controller, dynamically generating task curricula for an RL agent to promote open-ended skill acquisition. The primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop the LACOL Framework:** Design and implement a closed-loop system where an RL agent interacts with procedurally generated environments, its performance data (especially failures) is analyzed to identify "skill gaps," an LLM proposes new tasks to address these gaps, these tasks are filtered for quality and diversity, instantiated in the environment, and added to the agent's training curriculum.
2.  **Investigate LLM Capabilities for Adaptive Task Generation:** Evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in interpreting agent performance data and generating novel, meaningful, and progressively complex task specifications (ranging from parameter variations to compositional challenges) based on identified skill gaps. Explore different prompting strategies and LLM architectures.
3.  **Demonstrate Sustained, Open-Ended Learning:** Empirically validate that the LACOL framework can sustain learning over extended periods, enabling the agent to continually acquire new skills and master an increasing repertoire of tasks, preventing stagnation observed in fixed-task training.
4.  **Enhance Generalization and Robustness:** Assess whether agents trained with LACOL exhibit improved zero-shot generalization to unseen, out-of-distribution tasks compared to baseline methods, attributing this to the diverse and adaptive nature of the generated curriculum.
5.  **Evaluate Curriculum Quality and Efficiency:** Quantify the diversity, complexity, and learning potential of the generated tasks using appropriate metrics, including quality-diversity measures and a proposed "Out-of-Distribution Difficulty" (ODD) score. Analyze the computational overhead of the framework.

**2.3. Significance**
This research directly addresses key challenges highlighted by the ALOE workshop, particularly concerning the development of scalable, open-ended environments, adaptive curricula, and understanding the role of large generative models in learning dynamics.

*   **Automating Curriculum Design for OEL:** LACOL offers a principled approach to automating the challenging process of curriculum design, moving beyond fixed or randomly generated tasks towards adaptive generation informed by the agent's learning progress. This contrasts with prior LLM work (Ryu et al., 2024; Erak et al., 2024) by explicitly focusing on open-endedness and using agent failures as the primary driver for task generation.
*   **Promoting Generalization:** By continually exposing the agent to novel challenges targeted at its weaknesses, LACOL aims to produce agents with more robust and generalizable skills, crucial for real-world deployment and sim2real transfer.
*   **Harnessing LLMs for OEL:** This work explores a novel synergy between LLMs and RL within the OEL paradigm. Instead of using LLMs solely for policy guidance (Ma et al., 2024) or fixed curriculum specification (Ryu et al., 2024), we position the LLM as a dynamic component *within* the OEL loop, generating the learning challenges themselves.
*   **Understanding Adaptive Learning Dynamics:** The framework provides a testbed for studying how self-generated curricula influence agent development, potentially leading to emergent complexity and capabilities not explicitly programmed, contributing to a deeper understanding of OEL systems.
*   **Contribution to Benchmarking:** The proposed methodology, including the ODD score and the analysis of generated task diversity, can contribute towards developing better benchmarks and metrics for evaluating open-endedness in RL agents.

## **3. Methodology**

**3.1. System Overview: The LACOL Loop**
The proposed LACOL framework operates as a closed-loop system dynamically coupling an RL agent, a performance analyzer, an LLM-based task generator, and a quality-diversity task filter. The process iterates as follows (See Figure 1 conceptual diagram - *Conceptual diagram to be included in a full visual proposal*):

1.  **Agent Training & Interaction:** An RL agent interacts with environments defined by a set of tasks currently in the active curriculum $\mathcal{C}_{active}$. The agent's policy $\pi_\theta$ is updated using a standard RL algorithm (e.g., PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) or SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018)). Trajectories $\tau = (s_0, a_0, r_0, ..., s_T, a_T, r_T)$ are collected.
2.  **Performance Analysis & Skill Gap Identification:** Trajectories are analyzed to assess performance on current tasks and identify "skill gaps." This involves:
    *   Calculating success rates and return statistics for each task $T_i \in \mathcal{C}_{active}$.
    *   Identifying failure modes: Analyzing trajectories ending in failure states or exhibiting suboptimal behavior (e.g., low reward sequences, repetitive actions in non-goal states, failure to interact with specific objects/regions). This may involve heuristic checks or potentially clustering embeddings of failure states/sub-trajectories.
    *   Summarizing Skill Gaps: Compiling a structured summary $G$ of unresolved tasks and identified failure patterns, potentially annotated with natural language descriptions or key state/action features.
3.  **LLM-based Task Generation:** The skill gap summary $G$, along with contextual information (e.g., history of generated tasks, current agent capabilities summary), is provided as input (prompt) to a large language model (LLM).
    *   **Prompting:** We will explore few-shot prompting strategies, providing the LLM with examples of successful task generation iterations. The prompt will instruct the LLM to propose a set of *new* task specifications $T_{prop} = \{t_1, t_2, ..., t_k\}$ designed to address the identified gaps $G$. Task specifications can be generated in a structured format (e.g., JSON defining parameters, objectives, constraints) or potentially as executable code snippets modifying environment parameters or reward functions, building on ideas from Ryu et al. (2024). The LLM will be encouraged to generate variations of existing tasks (e.g., different object placements, increased difficulty) and potentially novel compositional tasks combining existing skills.
    *   **LLM Choice:** We will initially experiment with readily available powerful LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3) and potentially fine-tune smaller, more efficient models if needed.
4.  **Task Filtering & Curriculum Update:** The proposed tasks $T_{prop}$ are filtered to maintain a high-quality, diverse, and appropriately challenging curriculum $\mathcal{C}_{active}$.
    *   **Instantiation & Validity Check:** Proposed task specifications are parsed and instantiated within the simulation environment. Tasks that are syntactically invalid or physically impossible are discarded.
    *   **Quality-Diversity (QD) Filtering:** We employ a QD approach (Pugh et al., 2016; Cully et al., 2015) to manage the task pool. We maintain an archive $\mathcal{A}$ of tasks, potentially structured as a MAP-Elites grid (Mouret & Clune, 2015).
        *   *Behavior Descriptors (BDs):* Define features characterizing a task's nature (e.g., required object interaction types, navigation complexity, compositional elements). These could be derived from the task specification or estimated from agent rollouts.
        *   *Quality Metric (Fitness):* Define a measure of task "interestingness" or learning potential. This could be related to the agent's uncertainty (e.g., variance in returns), novelty compared to existing archive tasks, or an estimate of the learning progress it induces (related to UED objectives, Jiang, 2023). We will also investigate using a proxy for the proposed **Out-of-Distribution Difficulty (ODD) score**: estimating how challenging the task is likely to be for the *current* policy $\pi_\theta$ (e.g., based on initial rollout performance or policy entropy on the task).
        *   *Archive Update:* Newly proposed and validated tasks $t \in T_{prop}$ compete for inclusion in the archive $\mathcal{A}$ based on their BDs and fitness. Tasks that populate new cells in the BD space or improve fitness in existing cells are added.
    *   **Active Curriculum Selection:** The active curriculum $\mathcal{C}_{active}$ for the next agent training iteration is sampled from the archive $\mathcal{A}$, potentially prioritizing tasks near the agent's current performance frontier (challenging but not impossible).
5.  **Loop:** The process repeats from Step 1 with the updated $\mathcal{C}_{active}$.

**3.2. Data Collection and Representation**
*   **Agent Trajectories:** Standard RL trajectory data $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1}, d_t)$ where $s$ is state, $a$ is action, $r$ is reward, $d$ is termination signal. State representations will depend on the environment (feature vectors, pixel observations).
*   **Performance Data:** Task success rates, episode lengths, cumulative rewards, specific failure flags (e.g., timeout, constraint violation, wrong goal).
*   **Skill Gap Representation:** Structured representation $G$ containing identifiers of failed tasks, quantitative performance metrics, and potentially natural language descriptions or feature vectors characterizing failure modes (e.g., "Agent failed to navigate around obstacle type X", "Low reward when target object is occluded").
*   **Task Specification Format:** A structured format (e.g., JSON, XML) defining environment parameters (e.g., `object_positions`, `goal_location`, `obstacle_density`), reward function modifications, termination conditions, and potentially natural language descriptions for LLM processing.

**3.3. Algorithmic Details**
*   **RL Algorithm:** We will primarily use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) due to its stability and widespread use, but the framework is agnostic to the specific RL algorithm. The policy $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ and value function $V_\phi(s)$ will be parameterized by neural networks. The PPO objective is approximately:
    $$L^{CLIP+VF+S}(\theta) = \mathbb{\hat{E}}_t [ L_t^{CLIP}(\theta) - c_1 L_t^{VF}(\theta) + c_2 S[\pi_\theta](s_t) ]$$
    where $L_t^{CLIP}$ is the clipped surrogate objective, $L_t^{VF}$ is the squared-error value function loss, and $S$ is an entropy bonus.
*   **Skill Gap Analysis:** Failure analysis will start with heuristics (e.g., identifying states frequently preceding termination without success) and may incorporate trajectory embedding methods (e.g., using autoencoders or transformers on state-action sequences) to cluster failure types for more nuanced input to the LLM.
*   **LLM Prompt Design:** We will use few-shot prompting with input-output examples of skill gaps leading to appropriate new tasks. The prompt structure will be refined iteratively:
    ```
    # Context: RL agent learning task X in environment Y.
    # Current Active Tasks & Performance: {Task_A: 95% success, Task_B: 40% success, ...}
    # Recent Skill Gaps / Failure Modes:
    # - Failure on Task_B: Agent gets stuck in region Z when goal is near obstacle type P.
    # - Low reward on Task_C: Agent navigates inefficiently around concave structures.
    # - New Task Requirement: Generate 3 new task specifications (JSON format) addressing these gaps, aiming for slightly increased difficulty or novelty. Maintain constraints [constraints...].

    # Examples:
    # [Example 1 Input -> Example 1 Output JSON]
    # [Example 2 Input -> Example 2 Output JSON]

    # Current Input:
    # [Current Skill Gap Summary G]

    # LLM Generated Output:
    # [LLM generates JSON task specifications t_1, t_2, t_3]
    ```
*   **QD Algorithm:** We will likely start with MAP-Elites. The archive $\mathcal{A}$ is a grid where each cell corresponds to a range of BD values. Each cell stores the task specification $t$ that achieved the highest fitness $f(t)$ within that BD range. When a new task $t'$ is generated, its BD $b(t')$ and fitness $f(t')$ are computed. If the corresponding cell $\mathcal{A}[b(t')]$ is empty or $f(t') > f(\mathcal{A}[b(t')].task)$, then $t'$ replaces the task in that cell. $$ \mathcal{A}[b(t')] \leftarrow t' \quad \text{if} \quad \mathcal{A}[b(t')] \text{ is empty or } f(t') > f(\mathcal{A}[b(t')].task) $$
*   **ODD Score:** The Out-of-Distribution Difficulty score for a task $t$ will be estimated based on the current policy $\pi_\theta$'s performance degradation on $t$ compared to its performance on tasks it was recently trained on, or based on policy uncertainty metrics (e.g., entropy, variance of value estimates) when encountering states in $t$. A simple version could be $ODD(t | \pi_\theta) = 1 - \text{SuccessRate}(\pi_\theta, t)$. The QD fitness could prioritize tasks with moderate ODD scores.

**3.4. Experimental Design**
*   **Environments:**
    1.  *Procedural Gridworld:* A simple 2D environment with controllable complexity (map size, obstacle density, goal locations, item collection) to facilitate rapid prototyping and analysis. Task space involves navigation, collection, and sequencing.
    2.  *Robotic Manipulation Suite:* Utilize existing benchmarks like FetchReach/Push/PickPlace from OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al., 2016) or environments like Meta-World (Yu et al., 2019), allowing procedural variation of object types, positions, goal configurations, and potentially distractions.
    3.  *ProcGen Benchmark (Optional):* Explore applying LACOL to environments from the ProcGen benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2020) known for requiring generalization, although defining structured task generation might be more challenging here.
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  *Fixed Curriculum:* Agent trained on a static set of tasks representative of the environment's capabilities, potentially hand-designed.
    2.  *Random Task Generation:* Agent trained on tasks where parameters are randomly sampled within predefined ranges at each iteration, without adaptation based on performance.
    3.  *UED Baseline:* Implement a simpler UED method like Protagonist-Antagonist Induced Regret (PAIR) (Dennis et al., 2020) or Adaptive Mismatch Curriculum (ACCEL) (Jiang et al., 2021) for comparison, which automates curriculum but without explicit LLM reasoning about failure modes.
    4.  *Ablation Studies:* Evaluate LACOL variants (e.g., without QD filter, different LLM prompting strategies, simpler skill gap analysis).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  *Learning Speed & Final Performance:* Track success rate/return on the *entire archive* of generated tasks over training time.
    2.  *Generalization Score:* Evaluate the final trained policy $\pi_\theta$ zero-shot on a held-out set of manually designed, challenging tasks $T_{test}$ representing OOD scenarios. Compare performance against baselines.
    3.  *Curriculum Analysis:*
        *   *Archive Size/Coverage:* Number of populated cells in the QD archive over time.
        *   *Task Complexity:* Measure complexity of tasks in the archive (e.g., required steps, number of sub-goals, parameter ranges).
        *   *ODD Score Distribution:* Analyze the distribution of ODD scores of tasks in the active curriculum and the archive over time.
    4.  *Sample Efficiency:* Total environment steps required to reach performance thresholds.
    5.  *Computational Cost:* Measure wall-clock time, LLM API calls/cost, and computational resources used.

**4.2. Impact**
This research aims to make significant contributions to the field of artificial intelligence, particularly within the context of open-ended learning and reinforcement learning:

*   **Advancing OEL Methodologies:** LACOL provides a novel, practical approach to generating adaptive curricula, a cornerstone challenge in OEL. It integrates the strengths of modern generative models (LLMs) with principled RL and curriculum learning techniques (QD, UED concepts).
*   **Bridging LLMs and RL for Deeper Integration:** This work goes beyond using LLMs for high-level planning or one-off setup, exploring their potential as dynamic components *within* the learning loop, actively shaping the agent's learning trajectory by creating the challenges themselves.
*   **Improving Agent Robustness and Generalization:** By fostering the acquisition of a diverse skill repertoire tailored to the agent's evolving capabilities, the framework directly targets improved generalization and robustness, crucial for deploying agents in complex, unpredictable real-world environments (including sim2real).
*   **Informing Future OEL Benchmarks:** The methodology and metrics developed (like the practical application of QD for tasks and the ODD score) can inform the design of future benchmarks for rigorously evaluating open-endedness in AI systems.
*   **Relevance to ALOE Workshop Themes:** The project directly addresses ALOE's core themes, including scalable OEL simulations, adaptive curricula, leveraging generative models, measuring open-endedness, and emergent complexity, potentially yielding results highly relevant to the workshop community.

Ultimately, by enabling artificial agents to engage in more sustained, self-driven learning processes, this research contributes towards the long-term goal of creating more generally capable and adaptable AI systems.
