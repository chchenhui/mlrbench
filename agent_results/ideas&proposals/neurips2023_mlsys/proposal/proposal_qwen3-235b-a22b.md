# Title  
**GreenSched – Reinforcement Learning–Driven Energy-Carbon-Aware Job Scheduling in Cloud Datacenters**  

---

# 1. Introduction  

## Background  
Cloud datacenters are the backbone of modern digital infrastructure, but they consume **~2% of global electricity** and contribute approximately **1% of total CO₂ emissions**. Current resource schedulers prioritize metrics like throughput and latency but ignore dynamic energy price fluctuations, renewable energy availability, and **spatiotemporal variability in grid carbon intensity**. For instance, a job scheduled in Texas at noon (sunny) might use solar energy, while the same job in Germany at night relies on fossil fuels. This disconnect creates missed opportunities to reduce operational costs and environmental impact.  

## Motivation  
Existing solutions for energy-carbon-aware scheduling suffer from two limitations:  
1. **Static or heuristic policies**: Systems like CarbonClipper [1] and PCAPS [2] use online optimization but lack adaptability to dynamic workloads and environmental conditions.  
2. **Limited control levers**: Tools like CarbonScaler [3] focus on resource allocation but ignore hyperparameters (e.g., CPU/GPU power caps) and mobility (e.g., VM migration).  

## Research Objectives  
GreenSched aims to **bridge these gaps** by developing:  
1. A **deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework** that jointly optimizes energy cost, carbon emissions, and Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance.  
2. A **multi-action control system** combining job scheduling, power capping, and migration in heterogeneous clusters.  
3. A **Kubernetes-integrated testbed** validated through simulations with real workload traces, energy price, and carbon intensity datasets.  

## Significance  
By integrating DRL with hardware-level controls and geospatial carbon data, GreenSched addresses five critical challenges in ML for Systems:  
1. **Unified cost-carbon-SLA optimization** via reinforcement learning.  
2. **Adaptability to dynamic environments** (e.g., renewable generation surges).  
3. **Scalability** through distributed actor-learner architectures.  
4. **Reproducibility** via open-source simulator framework.  
5. **Enterprise deployment readiness** with Kubernetes integration.  

This aligns with the ML for Systems workshop’s call for "unifying benchmarks" and "applying ML to compute sustainability" [Task Description].

# 2. Methodology  

GreenSched's methodology consists of **four phases**:  

## Phase 1: Problem Formalization  
We model the scheduling task as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**:  
- **State Space $S$**: $ \mathcal{S} = \mathcal{W} \times \mathcal{U} \times \mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{C} $  
  - $\mathcal{W}$: Jobs in queue (resource demands, deadlines)  
  - $\mathcal{U}$: Node utilization (CPU/GPU/RAM)  
  - $\mathcal{E}$: Real-time electricity prices (locational marginal pricing)  
  - $\mathcal{C}$: Forecasted carbon intensity (kgCO₂/kWh)  
- **Action Space $\mathcal{A}$**:  
  - **Job assignment**: Map job $j_i$ to machine $m_k$  
  - **Deferral**: Delay scheduling for $t' \in [0, T_{\text{deferral}}]$  
  - **Power capping**: Set GPU frequency (between 0–100%)  
  - **Migration**: Live-migrate VMs between nodes  
- **Reward Function $R(s_t, a_t)$**:  
  $$R = -\alpha \cdot C_{\text{energy}} - \beta \cdot E_{\text{carbon}} - \gamma \cdot S_{\text{SLA}}$$  
  - $C_{\text{energy}}$: Energy cost ($\sum_{m \in M} \text{Power}_m \cdot \text{Price}_{m,\text{now}}$)  
  - $E_{\text{carbon}}$: Carbon emissions ($\sum_{m \in M} \text{Power}_m \cdot \text{Carbon}_{m,\text{now}}$)  
  - $S_{\text{SLA}}$: Penalty for overall deadline miss (≥10%)  
  - Weights $\alpha=1.0,\beta=0.8,\gamma=0.2$ derived via sensitivity analysis.  

## Phase 2: Simulator Design  
We implement a **high-fidelity discrete-event simulator** using CloudSim and Kubernetes observability pipelines:  
1. **Input datasets**:  
   - **Workloads**: Google Cluster Trace (containers), Alibaba Trace (batch jobs)  
   - **Energy prices**: CAISO/PJM historical marginal pricing (15-minute resolution)  
   - **Carbon intensity**: European grid data [1] and Google's carbon-intensity dataset.  
2. **Simulation parameters**:  
   - 1,000 heterogeneous nodes (mixed CPU/GPU) across 5 regions  
   - 24-hour simulation duration with 1-minute timesteps  
3. **Validation**: Calibrate against Kubernetes cluster benchmarks [2].  

## Phase 3: DRL Implementation  
### Architecture  
GreenSched employs **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** with twin networks:  
- **State encoder**: Fully connected layers (ReLU) compress $S$ into 128-d embedding  
- **Policy network $\pi_\theta$**: Outputs actions via actor (probability distribution) and critic (value $V(s)$) heads  
- **Multi-discrete action handling**: Separate policy heads for assignment, power capping, migration  
- **Reward shaping**:  
  $$R_{\text{shaped}} = R + \lambda \cdot \sum_{m \in M} \text{Idle}_m \cdot \text{Carbon}_m^{\text{avg}}$$  
  (Encourage consolidating jobs on low-carbon nodes even without immediate rewards).  

### Training Protocol  
1. **Pre-training**:  
   - Initialize policy with expert-guided rollouts (CarbonClipper [1] + Pacer [3])  
   - Curriculum learning: Stages for cost, carbon, and SLA optimization  
2. **Parallel rollouts**: 512 distributed actors in simulation, batch size 64  
3. **Hyperparameters**:  
   - Learning rate $3 \cdot 10^{-4}$ (actor), $10^{-3}$ (critic)  
   - Discount factor $\gamma=0.99$, GAE $\lambda=0.94$  
   - 200 epochs with GRU-based temporal attention  

## Phase 4: Real-World Deployment  
1. **Kubernetes Integration**:  
   - Replace kube-scheduler extender with GreenSched API [2]  
   - Control power caps via NVIDIA NVML and Intel P-states  
2. **A/B Testing**:  
   - Deploy half of cluster nodes with GreenSched vs. baselines (CarbonScaler, Spice [3])  
   - Monitor for 30 days across seasonal variations  
3. **Evaluation Metrics**:  
   | Metric                     | Formula                                                                 |  
   |---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
   | Energy Cost ($\downarrow$) | $\sum_{m \in M} \text{Power}_m \cdot \text{Price}_{m}$                 |  
   | Carbon Emissions ($\downarrow$) | $\sum_{m \in M} \text{Power}_m \cdot \text{Carbon}_{m}$         |  
   | Mean Job Latency ($\updownarrow$) | $\mathbb{E}[t_{\text{completion}} - t_{\text{submit}}]$       |  
   | Deadline Miss Rate ($\downarrow$) | $\frac{|\{j \in J | SLA_j < 0.9\}|}{|J|}$                    |

# 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

## Technical Outcomes  
1. **Performance Improvements**:  
   - **20–30% lower energy costs** vs. CarbonScaler [3] via dynamic pricing arbitrage  
   - **35–45% reduced carbon emissions** compared to Spice [4] by leveraging renewable surges  
   - **<2% latency overhead** relative to default Kubernetes scheduler  
2. **Scaling Efficiency**:  
   - Linear runtime complexity $O(N)$ via distributed actors, validated for $N \in \{50, 100, 500, 1000\}$ nodes  

## Scientific Contribution  
1. **First open DRL scheduler** integrating **power capping, migration, and spatiotemporal carbon awareness** in unified framework  
2. **Hashed state representations** enabling generalization across workload distributions without retraining  

## Societal & Industry Impact  
1. **Environmental**: Scaling GreenSched to 1,000 AWS EC2 instances could reduce annual CO₂ emissions by **~15,000 metric tons** (equivalent to 3,300 transatlantic flights)  
2. **Economic**: For a hyperscaler with 1M GPU hours/month, 25% energy cost reduction saves **$1.2M/year** (assuming $0.60 kWh−1)  
3. **Open Science**: Release of:  
   - Simulator environment with replicable experiment code  
   - Traces dataset with carbon-annotated workload metadata  

## Broader Implications for ML for Systems  
This work directly addresses the **workshop’s focus** on "unifying benchmarks" and "compute sustainability" by:  
1. Proposing a **reproducible scheduling benchmark** for energy-carbon-SLA trade-offs  
2. Demonstrating how **ML can address systems challenges** emerging from large-scale ML training (aligns with the workshop’s focus on LLM deployment)

# Conclusion  
GreenSched pioneers the application of DRL to energy-carbon-conscious scheduling by combining multi-timescale controls (job assignment, power, and mobility). Through extensive simulation and Kubernetes deployment, we address the scalability, adaptability, and integration challenges highlighted in the literature [1–4], while aligning with the ML for Systems workshop’s mission to advance sustainable AI infrastructure. The project will be released as open-source software to catalyze further research in this critical domain.
