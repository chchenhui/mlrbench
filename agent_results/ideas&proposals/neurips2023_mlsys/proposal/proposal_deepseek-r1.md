### 1. **Title**  
**GreenSched: Reinforcement Learning for Energy-Carbon-Aware Job Scheduling in Cloud Data Centers**

---

### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Cloud data centers are critical infrastructure for modern computing but consume 1–2% of global electricity, contributing significantly to carbon emissions. Traditional job schedulers prioritize performance metrics like throughput and latency, often ignoring dynamic energy costs and grid carbon intensity. Recent work, such as CarbonClipper and PCAPS, highlights the potential of carbon-aware scheduling but relies on heuristic or rule-based approaches. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in systems optimization, as seen in multi-agent frameworks for AI workload scheduling. However, no existing solution holistically optimizes energy costs, carbon emissions, and service-level agreements (SLAs) through adaptive machine learning.

**Research Objectives**  
This project aims to develop **GreenSched**, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based scheduler that:  
1. Dynamically optimizes job assignments, power management, and VM migrations to minimize energy costs and carbon emissions.  
2. Maintains job performance by incorporating SLA-violation penalties into its reward function.  
3. Provides an open-source, reproducible framework for sustainable scheduling research.  

**Significance**  
GreenSched addresses two urgent challenges:  
- **Operational Costs**: Energy price fluctuations and carbon taxes increasingly impact cloud providers’ profitability.  
- **Environmental Impact**: Data centers contribute 0.3% of global CO₂ emissions; reducing their footprint aligns with climate goals.  
By integrating real-time sustainability metrics into scheduling, this work bridges a critical gap in ML for systems and advances the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

### 3. **Methodology**  
**Research Design**  
GreenSched employs a DRL agent trained in a simulated environment and deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. The framework includes:  

#### **Data Collection & State Representation**  
- **Input Data**:  
  - *Workload Traces*: Job resource demands (CPU/GPU, memory), arrival rates, and deadlines from Google Cluster Workload Traces.  
  - *Energy & Carbon Data*: Hourly electricity prices and grid carbon intensity (gCO₂eq/kWh) from public APIs (e.g., WattTime).  
  - *Node Utilization*: Real-time CPU/GPU usage, memory pressure, and thermal metrics.  
- **State Vector**:  
  $$
  s_t = \left[ \mathbf{J}_t, \mathbf{N}_t, \mathbf{E}_t, \mathbf{C}_t \right]
  $$
  where $\mathbf{J}_t$ encodes queued jobs’ resource needs, $\mathbf{N}_t$ is node utilization, $\mathbf{E}_t$ is energy prices, and $\mathbf{C}_t$ is carbon intensity forecasts.  

#### **Action Space**  
The agent selects actions from:  
1. **Job Assignment**: Distribute jobs across heterogeneous servers (CPU vs. GPU).  
2. **Power Capping**: Adjust dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) states to limit power per node.  
3. **VM Migration**: Relocate VMs to regions with lower carbon intensity or energy costs.  
4. **Delay Scheduling**: Postpone non-urgent jobs during high carbon/energy periods.  

#### **Reward Function**  
The reward balances sustainability and performance:  
$$
R_t = -\left( \alpha \cdot \text{EnergyCost}_t + \beta \cdot \text{CarbonEmissions}_t \right) - \gamma \cdot \text{SLAViolations}_t
$$  
where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are tunable weights.  

#### **Algorithm**  
We use **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, an actor-critic algorithm, for its stability in continuous action spaces. The policy network $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ and value network $V_\phi(s)$ are trained via:  
$$
L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \min\left( \frac{\pi_\theta(a|s)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a|s)} A_t, \text{clip}\left(\frac{\pi_\theta(a|s)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a|s)}, 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon\right) A_t \right) \right]
$$  
where $A_t$ is the advantage function estimated by generalized advantage estimation (GAE).  

#### **Experimental Design**  
- **Simulator**: A high-fidelity simulator models data center nodes, job arrivals, and energy-carbon dynamics. Training uses real traces scaled to 10,000 nodes.  
- **Baselines**: Compare against:  
  - **CarbonClipper** (carbon-aware heuristic).  
  - **PCAPS** (carbon- and precedence-aware scheduler).  
  - **CarbonScaler** (elasticity-driven scheduler).  
- **Metrics**:  
  - *Energy Cost*: Total $/kWh consumed × price.  
  - *Carbon Emissions*: Total gCO₂eq from energy use.  
  - *Job Completion Time*: 95th percentile latency.  
  - *SLA Violations*: Percentage of jobs exceeding deadlines.  
- **Real-World Deployment**: Fine-tune the policy in a Kubernetes testbed with 50 nodes, using Kubeflow for workload orchestration.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Performance Improvements**:  
   - 15–30% reduction in energy costs compared to heuristic schedulers.  
   - 20–40% lower carbon emissions via spatiotemporal workload shifting.  
   - <5% increase in job completion times, maintaining SLA compliance.  
2. **Open-Source Framework**: Release GreenSched’s code, simulator, and Kubernetes integration tools to accelerate reproducibility.  

**Impact**  
- **Environmental**: Potential annual savings of 2.1M tons of CO₂ if deployed across major cloud providers.  
- **Economic**: Lower operational costs for data centers, incentivizing adoption of sustainable practices.  
- **Research**: Establish RL as a viable methodology for systems optimization, encouraging cross-disciplinary collaborations.

### 5. **Conclusion**  
GreenSched represents a paradigm shift in sustainable cloud computing by unifying DRL with real-time energy-carbon awareness. By addressing scalability, dynamic pricing, and SLA constraints, this work advances ML for systems while contributing to global sustainability efforts. The proposed framework will serve as a foundation for future research in carbon-efficient computing.
