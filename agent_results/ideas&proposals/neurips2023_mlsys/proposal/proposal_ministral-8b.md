# GreenSched – Reinforcement Learning–Driven Energy-Carbon-Aware Job Scheduling

## Introduction

### Background

Cloud datacenters are critical infrastructure for modern computing, but they also consume vast amounts of energy and contribute significantly to carbon emissions. Traditional scheduling algorithms primarily focus on optimizing throughput and latency, often ignoring the environmental impact. The increasing urgency to mitigate climate change demands more sustainable approaches to managing computing resources. This research proposal presents GreenSched, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) scheduler designed to minimize both energy consumption and carbon emissions while maintaining job performance metrics.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. **Develop an adaptive DRL scheduler** that can dynamically adjust job assignments and resource allocations based on real-time energy costs and carbon intensity forecasts.
2. **Integrate dynamic electricity pricing and grid carbon intensity** into the scheduling decisions to optimize for sustainability without compromising job performance.
3. **Validate the proposed scheduler** through high-fidelity simulations and real-world testing in a Kubernetes testbed.

### Significance

GreenSched addresses a critical gap in the current scheduling paradigms by incorporating sustainability considerations. By doing so, it can:
- Reduce operational expenses for data center operators.
- Lower the carbon footprint of cloud services.
- Contribute to broader sustainability goals in the computing industry.

## Methodology

### Research Design

GreenSched employs a DRL approach to develop a policy that optimizes job scheduling decisions. The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **State Representation**: The state $s_t$ at time $t$ includes:
   - Per-job resource demands (CPU, GPU, memory).
   - Current queue times.
   - Server utilization rates.
   - Short-term renewable generation forecasts.
   - Grid carbon intensity predictions.

2. **Action Space**: The scheduler can perform the following actions:
   - Assign or delay jobs to servers.
   - Adjust CPU/GPU power caps.
   - Trigger VM migrations.

3. **Reward Signal**: The reward function $r_t$ is a weighted combination of:
   - Negative energy cost: $-\alpha \cdot E(t)$ (where $E(t)$ is the energy consumption at time $t$).
   - Negative carbon emissions: $-\beta \cdot C(t)$ (where $C(t)$ is the carbon emissions at time $t$).
   - SLA-violation penalties: $-\gamma \cdot P(t)$ (where $P(t)$ is the penalty for service-level agreement violations).

### Training and Validation

**Training Phase**:
- **Simulator**: Use a high-fidelity simulator seeded with real trace data to train the DRL agent.
- **Algorithm**: Employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn the optimal policy $\pi$.
- **Hyperparameters**: Tune learning rate, discount factor, and exploration noise parameters.

**Validation Phase**:
- **Kubernetes Testbed**: Fine-tune the learned policy in a real-world Kubernetes environment.
- **Metrics**: Evaluate GreenSched using energy consumption, carbon emissions, and job completion time metrics.

### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of GreenSched will be evaluated based on the following metrics:
- **Energy Savings**: Percentage reduction in energy expenditure compared to baseline schedulers.
- **Carbon Emissions Reduction**: Percentage decrease in carbon footprint.
- **Job Completion Time**: Impact on job completion times, ensuring no significant degradation in performance.

### Mathematical Formulation

The DRL problem can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with the following elements:
- **States**: $S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}$.
- **Actions**: $A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m\}$.
- **Transition Function**: $P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$.
- **Reward Function**: $R(s_t, a_t)$.
- **Policy**: $\pi(a_t | s_t)$.

The objective is to find the optimal policy $\pi^*$ that maximizes the expected cumulative reward:
$$
\pi^* = \arg\max_\pi \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{T} R(s_t, a_t)\right].
$$

## Expected Outcomes & Impact
