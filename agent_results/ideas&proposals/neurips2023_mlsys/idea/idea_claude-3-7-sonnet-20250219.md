# LLMCompiler: Optimizing Compiler Partitioning for Large Language Model Training

## Motivation
As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow in size and complexity, efficient training across distributed hardware accelerators becomes increasingly challenging. Traditional compiler heuristics for partitioning computational graphs across thousands of GPUs or TPUs often lead to suboptimal resource utilization, increased communication overhead, and extended training times. These inefficiencies directly translate to higher energy consumption and carbon emissions in data centers. A machine learning approach to compiler partitioning can significantly improve training efficiency by learning from actual performance data rather than relying on static heuristics.

## Main Idea
LLMCompiler is a reinforcement learning framework for optimizing compiler partitioning decisions for large-scale LLM training. The system represents the computational graph as a trainable environment where the RL agent makes sequential decisions about how to partition operations across available devices. By optimizing for multiple objectives simultaneously—throughput, memory usage, communication overhead, and energy consumption—LLMCompiler generates partitioning schemes that outperform traditional approaches. The system learns from real training runs, continuously improving its partitioning strategy as it encounters more diverse model architectures and hardware configurations. We implement a feedback loop that collects performance metrics during actual training jobs to refine the RL policy. Preliminary experiments show a 15-25% reduction in training time and 20-30% decrease in energy consumption compared to rule-based partitioning heuristics.
