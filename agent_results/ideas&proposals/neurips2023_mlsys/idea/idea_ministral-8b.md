### Title: "Efficient LLM Training Scheduling via Reinforcement Learning"

### Motivation
The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to unprecedented computational demands, particularly during their training phases. Current scheduling techniques often rely on heuristics, which may not be optimal for these complex, large-scale workloads. This research aims to address the inefficiencies in LLM training by developing a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize training schedules, thereby reducing training time and resource consumption.

### Main Idea
This research proposes a reinforcement learning framework for optimizing LLM training schedules. The key components include:
- **Environment Design**: The environment is modeled as a multi-agent system where each agent represents a GPU or TPU responsible for training a portion of the LLM. The state includes current training progress, resource availability, and system constraints.
- **Agent Design**: Each agent uses a deep Q-network (DQN) to make scheduling decisions. The actions include assigning different training tasks to available resources, prioritizing tasks based on their impact on the overall training time, and dynamically adjusting resource allocation.
- **Reward Function**: The reward function is designed to maximize the overall training efficiency, considering factors such as task completion time, resource utilization, and energy consumption.
- **Training and Evaluation**: The RL agents are trained using off-policy methods such as DQN to learn optimal scheduling policies. The performance is evaluated using a set of benchmark LLM training tasks, comparing the proposed RL-based scheduling with traditional heuristic-based methods.

The expected outcomes include significant reductions in training time and energy consumption for LLMs, leading to more sustainable and efficient AI development. The potential impact is a standardized, reproducible methodology for LLM training scheduling, contributing to the broader adoption of machine learning in computer systems.
