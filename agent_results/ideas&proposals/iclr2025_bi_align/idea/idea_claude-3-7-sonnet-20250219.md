# Customizable Alignment Profiles: Democratizing Human-AI Alignment

## Motivation
Current AI alignment strategies often adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, assuming universal human values and preferences. This approach fails to account for cultural, individual, and contextual differences in how humans want to interact with AI. As AI systems become more integrated into diverse aspects of life, there's an urgent need for customizable alignment frameworks that respect individual agency while maintaining ethical boundaries. The gap between universal alignment methods and personalized human needs represents a critical challenge in bidirectional human-AI alignment.

## Main Idea
I propose developing an open-source framework for "Alignment Profiles" that users can customize based on their preferences while preserving essential safety parameters. This system would operate on three levels: (1) Core Safety Layer - immutable ethical boundaries; (2) Contextual Layer - domain-specific preferences that adapt to different usage scenarios; and (3) Personal Layer - fully customizable preferences reflecting individual values. The system would utilize interactive preference elicitation techniques that evolve over time, capturing both explicit stated preferences and implicit behavioral signals. A blockchain-based verification system would ensure transparency while protecting privacy. By democratizing alignment customization, this approach advances both AI-to-human and human-to-AI alignment, empowering users to shape their AI interactions while creating feedback loops that help systems better understand diverse human values.
