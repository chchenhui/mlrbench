Title: Adaptive Metacognitive Assistant for Real-Time Bidirectional Alignment

Motivation:  
As AI decisions become more complex and contexts evolve, static alignment fails to capture shifting human preferences, undermining trust and performance. A dynamic, bidirectional mechanism is needed that both adapts AI behavior to users and empowers users to guide AI in real time.

Main Idea:  
We propose a dual-agent framework comprising a primary AI model and a metacognitive assistant that monitors context, user reactions, and alignment confidence. When preference drift or low confidence is detected, the assistant issues concise, active-learning queries via a lightweight interface, soliciting user feedback or corrections. Responses are used to update the primary model through online meta-reinforcement learning, while explanations of key decisions are visualized to bolster transparency. We will evaluate this system on tasks like document summarization and planning, measuring alignment drift, task performance, and user satisfaction. Anticipated outcomes include continuous co-adaptation, reduced misalignment incidents, enhanced user agency, and a scalable blueprint for dynamic human-AI collaboration.
