Title  
Dynamic Human-AI Co-Adaptation via Real-Time Feedback-Driven Alignment  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Traditional AI alignment methods—such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and offline preference learning—treat the alignment problem as a static, one-way process: human preferences are collected a priori, encoded as a reward or loss function, and then used to train or fine-tune an AI system. Yet in real-world applications (e.g., collaborative robots, personalized recommendation, adaptive tutoring), human preferences and contexts evolve continuously. As a result, models trained offline gradually drift away from user needs, leading to reduced trust, suboptimal performance, or even harmful behavior.  

The emerging paradigm of bidirectional human-AI alignment recognizes this dynamic interplay: not only must AI systems learn from humans (the AI-centered direction), but humans must also be able to understand, critique, and steer AI behavior (the human-centered direction). While methods such as online preference-based RL (Tu et al., 2024) and modular frameworks like SHARPIE (Aydın et al., 2025) have advanced interactive RL, two key challenges remain unaddressed:  
  • Continuous adaptation under non-stationary human preferences without catastrophic forgetting.  
  • Interpretable, human-centric explanations that empower users to guide AI.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop and evaluate a unified framework for real-time, bidirectional human-AI co-adaptation by:  
  1. Designing a hybrid online RL–imitation learning (IL) architecture that balances rapid adaptation to evolving feedback with retention of prior alignment objectives.  
  2. Developing a multimodal human feedback interface that integrates explicit corrections (natural language, scalar ratings) and implicit cues (behavioral signals) into a unified reward-shaping mechanism.  
  3. Generating concise, human-interpretable explanations of how specific feedback events influence the AI policy, thereby closing the transparency loop.  
  4. Validating the framework in longitudinal human studies across dynamic task domains, measuring alignment persistence, adaptation speed, user trust, and overall performance.  

Significance  
By harmonizing AI-centered and human-centered alignment, this work will establish the first end-to-end blueprint for resilient, context-aware co-adaptation in human-AI teams. Such a framework has the potential to:  
  • Improve safety and ethical compliance in rapidly changing environments (e.g., healthcare, autonomous driving).  
  • Enhance user satisfaction and trust in personalized AI systems (e.g., recommender systems, educational tutors).  
  • Catalyze new standards for dynamic alignment research, bridging ML, HCI, and social sciences.  

2. Methodology  
2.1 System Overview  
Our system consists of three interconnected modules:  
  A. Feedback Integration Module  
  B. Hybrid Learning Module  
  C. Explanation Generation Module  

Each user interaction at time $t$ yields a state $s_t$, an AI action $a_t$, and a multimodal feedback signal $f_t$. The overall pipeline is as follows:  
  1. The AI takes action $a_t \sim \pi_{\theta_t}(a \mid s_t)$.  
  2. The user provides feedback $f_t$ (explicit and/or implicit).  
  3. The Feedback Integration Module encodes $f_t$ into a scalar reward-shaping term $\Delta r_t$.  
  4. The Hybrid Learning Module updates the policy parameters $\theta_{t+1}$ using both RL and imitation learning signals.  
  5. The Explanation Generation Module produces a short, human-readable rationale for the policy update.  

2.2 Feedback Integration  
We represent the multimodal feedback $f_t$ as a tuple $(r_t^{\text{env}}, \ell_t, c_t)$, where:  
  • $r_t^{\text{env}}$ is the baseline reward from the task environment.  
  • $\ell_t \in \mathbb{R}$ is an explicit scalar rating provided by the user (e.g., “rate from –1 to +1”).  
  • $c_t$ is an optional natural language correction or comment.  

Step 2.2.1 Natural Language Encoding  
Natural language corrections $c_t$ are embedded via a pretrained encoder (e.g., a finetuned transformer) into a vector $e_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$. A learned linear layer then maps $e_t$ to a scalar reward adjustment:  
$$
\Delta r_t^{\text{NL}} = w^\top e_t + b.
$$  

Step 2.2.2 Implicit Feedback  
Implicit cues (e.g., dwell time, cursor movements) are mapped to $\Delta r_t^{\text{imp}}$ via a small supervised model trained on historical data.  

Step 2.2.3 Combined Reward  
The instantaneous shaped reward is  
$$
r_t = r_t^{\text{env}} + \alpha\,\ell_t + \beta\,\Delta r_t^{\text{NL}} + \gamma\,\Delta r_t^{\text{imp}},
$$  
where $\alpha,\beta,\gamma\ge 0$ are hyperparameters controlling the weight of each feedback channel.  

2.3 Hybrid Learning Module  
We propose a two-phase update at each time step: an RL phase and an IL phase.  

2.3.1 RL Phase (Policy Gradient Update)  
We adopt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) as our base RL algorithm. The surrogate objective is:  
$$
L^{\mathrm{PPO}}(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_{t}\Big[\min\big(r_t(\theta)\hat{A}_t,\; \mathrm{clip}(r_t(\theta),1-\epsilon,1+\epsilon)\,\hat{A}_t\big)\Big],
$$  
where $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\mathrm{old}}}(a_t|s_t)}$, $\hat{A}_t$ is the advantage estimate, and $\epsilon$ is the clipping threshold. We compute $\hat{A}_t$ using Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE).  

2.3.2 Imitation Learning Phase  
To prevent catastrophic forgetting of earlier feedback and to stabilize learning under non-stationarity, we maintain a small buffer $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{IL}}$ of tuples $(s_i,a_i)$ from recent “trusted” interactions (e.g., consistent positive feedback). We train the policy on this buffer via a behavioral cloning loss:  
$$
L^{\mathrm{IL}}(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}_{(s,a)\sim \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{IL}}}\big[\log \pi_\theta(a|s)\big].
$$  

2.3.3 Combined Update  
The total loss at each update iteration is a weighted sum:  
$$
L(\theta) \;=\; L^{\mathrm{PPO}}(\theta)\;+\;\lambda\,L^{\mathrm{IL}}(\theta),
$$  
where $\lambda$ controls the trade-off between adaptation and retention. We perform $K$ gradient steps on $L(\theta)$ per interaction batch.  

2.3.4 Algorithm Pseudocode  

```
Initialize policy θ₀, IL buffer 𝒟_IL ← ∅
for t = 0 to T do
  observe state s_t
  sample action a_t ~ π_{θ_t}(·|s_t)
  execute a_t, observe s_{t+1}, r_t^{env}
  obtain explicit ℓ_t, correction c_t, implicit cues
  encode Δr_t via Sec.2.2
  store (s_t, a_t, Δr_t) in RL buffer 𝒟_RL
  if ℓ_t > τ_pos then add (s_t, a_t) to 𝒟_IL
  if size(𝒟_RL) ≥ B or end of episode then
    compute advantages Â_t over 𝒟_RL
    for k = 1 to K do
      θ ← θ − η ∇_θ [L^{PPO}(θ) + λ L^{IL}(θ)]
    end
    clear 𝒟_RL
  end
  generate explanation for user (Sec.2.4)
  θ_{t+1} ← θ
end
```  

2.4 Explanation Generation  
After each policy update, the system generates a short, template-based explanation that highlights the most influential feedback signals. We compute the gradient attribution scores  
$$
g_i = \frac{\partial L^{\mathrm{PPO}}}{\partial w_i}\,\ell_t,  
$$  
for each feedback weight $w_i\in\{\alpha,\beta,\gamma\}$, then select the top contributor and render a sentence such as:  
“Your positive rating increased the robot’s preference for grouping items; the policy has been updated accordingly.”  

2.5 Experimental Design  
Domains  
  • Collaborative robotics: a simulated assembly task where users and a robot pick/place objects under evolving preferences (speed vs. accuracy).  
  • Personalized recommendation: a news recommendation system where user topics interest drift over time.  

Baselines  
  1. Offline RLHF with fixed reward model.  
  2. Online RLHF without IL buffering.  
  3. RLAIF (Lee et al., 2023) using purely AI-generated feedback.  

Participants  
We will recruit $N=60$ participants for each domain in a within-subject design. Each participant uses the dynamic system and one baseline, counterbalanced across sessions.  

Metrics  
  • Alignment Persistence: average deviation between user’s stated preference vector $p_t$ and system’s policy preference $\hat p_t$, measured by cosine similarity.  
  • Adaptation Speed: time or number of interactions to regain ≥90% alignment after a simulated preference shift.  
  • Task Performance: cumulative environment reward.  
  • Trust & Satisfaction: Likert-scale questionnaires administered at regular intervals.  
  • Explanation Utility: user’s self‐reported clarity and perceived control.  

Statistical Analysis  
We will perform repeated measures ANOVA on each metric, with post-hoc tests corrected for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni).
