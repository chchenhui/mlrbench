# Dynamic Human-AI Co-Adaptation via Real-Time Feedback-Driven Alignment  

## Introduction  

### Background  
Traditional AI alignment frameworks treat human-AI interaction as a unidirectional process, where AI systems are trained offline using static human preferences encoded through methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or preference-based learning (Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020). However, real-world deployments reveal critical limitations in this paradigm: human preferences evolve dynamically due to contextual shifts, new information, or changing goals, while AI systems must adapt to maintain alignment without compromising safety or user trust (Shah et al., 2022). The bidirectional human-AI alignment framework (as outlined in the workshop description) reframes this challenge as a *mutual adaptation process*, where both humans and AI systems continuously influence each other. This research addresses the core challenge of enabling **real-time, bidirectional alignment** through a novel integration of online reinforcement learning (RL), interpretable feedback mechanisms, and hybrid learning architectures.  

### Research Objectives  
This work aims to:  
1. **Develop a dynamic alignment framework** that enables real-time co-adaptation between AI systems and humans through multimodal feedback (e.g., natural language, behavioral signals).  
2. **Design a hybrid RL-imitation learning architecture** to balance adaptation to evolving preferences with retention of prior alignment objectives, mitigating non-stationarity.  
3. **Empower human agency** by generating context-specific explanations that clarify how feedback influences AI decisions, fostering user trust and control.  
4. **Validate the framework** through longitudinal studies in dynamic domains (e.g., collaborative robotics, personalized recommendations), measuring alignment persistence, adaptability, and user satisfaction.  

### Significance  
By addressing the limitations of static alignment, this research advances bidirectional human-AI alignment in three key ways:  
- **Technical Innovation**: Combines online RL with interpretable feedback loops to handle non-stationarity while maintaining policy stability.  
- **Human-Centric Design**: Integrates explainability into the adaptation process, ensuring users understand and can steer AI behavior.  
- **Societal Impact**: Enables safer, more adaptable AI systems for high-stakes domains like healthcare (e.g., personalized treatment planning) and education (e.g., adaptive tutoring systems).  

The proposed framework directly responds to the workshop’s call for interdisciplinary solutions that bridge AI, HCI, and ethics, while addressing challenges like scalable feedback (RLAIF; Lee et al., 2023), strategyproof elicitation (Kleine Buening et al., 2025), and over-optimization risks (Shi et al., 2024).

## Methodology  

### Framework Architecture  
The proposed system (Figure 1) consists of four interconnected modules:  
1. **Feedback Acquisition**: Collects multimodal human input (e.g., explicit corrections, implicit behavioral cues).  
2. **Policy Update**: Uses online RL to adapt the AI policy in real time while leveraging imitation learning to retain prior alignment.  
3. **Explanation Generation**: Produces counterfactual explanations linking user feedback to policy changes.  
4. **Evaluation Engine**: Measures alignment quality through technical metrics (e.g., reward stability) and human-centric surveys (e.g., trust, usability).  

### Data Collection & Preprocessing  
**Multimodal Feedback Signals**:  
- **Explicit Feedback**: Natural language corrections (e.g., “Increase the robot’s speed”) or ratings (1–5 scale).  
- **Implicit Feedback**: Behavioral signals like dwell time, gaze tracking, or task completion latency.  
- **Contextual Metadata**: Environmental variables (e.g., time of day, task phase) to contextualize preferences.  

Data is preprocessed using domain-specific encoders:  
- **Language Feedback**: Finetuned LLMs (e.g., Llama-3) to parse intent and map to action-space perturbations.  
- **Behavioral Signals**: Time-series models (e.g., LSTMs) to infer latent preferences from implicit cues.  

### Algorithmic Design  
#### Hybrid RL-Imitation Learning  
The policy $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ is trained using a hybrid objective:  
$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \alpha \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}}(\theta) + (1-\alpha) \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{IL}}(\theta)
$$  
where:  
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}}$: Online RL loss using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO; Schulman et al., 2017):  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}} = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \min \left( r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t \right) \right]
  $$  
  Here, $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t|s_t)}$ is the probability ratio, and $\hat{A}_t$ is the generalized advantage estimate.  
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{IL}}$: Imitation loss penalizing deviations from historically aligned policies:  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{IL}} = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ D_{\text{KL}} \left( \pi_{\theta_{\text{ref}}}(a|s) \parallel \pi_\theta(a|s) \right) \right]
  $$  
  where $\pi_{\theta_{\text{ref}}}$ is a reference policy trained on prior alignment data.  
- $\alpha \in [0,1]$: Dynamic weighting factor adjusted via Bayesian optimization to balance adaptation and stability.  

#### Feedback Interpretation & Explanation  
For each feedback instance $f_t$, the system generates a counterfactual explanation:  
$$
\Delta Q(s_t,a_t) = Q_{\theta}(s_t,a_t^{\text{feedback}}) - Q_{\theta}(s_t,a_t^{\text{original}})
$$  
This quantifies how the feedback alters the expected reward for action $a_t$ in state $s_t$. Explanations are visualized via saliency maps (for vision tasks) or natural language summaries (e.g., “Your feedback increased the priority of speed by 20%”).  

### Experimental Design  
#### Domains & Baselines  
- **Domains**:  
  1. **Collaborative Robotics**: A 2-DoF robotic arm assisting in object sorting under changing user preferences (e.g., prioritizing speed vs. precision).  
  2. **Personalized News Recommendation**: A system adapting article rankings based on real-time user feedback.  
- **Baselines**:  
  - Static RLHF (using PPO with fixed reward model).  
  - RLAIF (AI-generated feedback; Lee et al., 2023).  
  - KTO (direct alignment; Ethayarajh et al., 2024).  

#### Evaluation Metrics  
- **Technical Metrics**:  
  - **Alignment Persistence**: Correlation between AI actions and user preferences over time (Pearson’s $r$).  
  - **Adaptation Speed**: Time to converge to new preferences (measured in feedback iterations).  
  - **Reward Stability**: Variance in episodic reward to detect reward hacking.  
- **Human-Centric Metrics**:  
  - **Trust**: Measured via pre/post surveys using the Trust in AI scale (Hoffman et al., 2018).  
  - **Usability**: System Usability Scale (SUS; Brooke, 1996).  
  - **Subjective Alignment**: User ratings of “How well did the AI understand your feedback?” (1–7 Likert scale).  

#### Protocol  
1. **Simulated Environments**: Initial validation in MuJoCo (robotics) and a synthetic recommendation environment.  
2. **Longitudinal User Studies**: 100 participants interact with the system over 4 weeks, with preferences intentionally shifted mid-study to test adaptation.  
3. **Ablation Studies**: Test variants of the hybrid loss ($\alpha$ values) and explanation modalities.
