## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **Dynamic Human-AI Co-Adaptation via Real-Time Feedback-Driven Bidirectional Alignment**

**2. Introduction**

**Background:**
The rapid proliferation and increasing capability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, particularly general-purpose models, necessitate robust mechanisms for aligning them with human values, intentions, and societal norms (Russell et al., 2015). Traditional AI alignment approaches often treat alignment as a static, unidirectional process: human specifications are gathered offline and used to train or fine-tune AI models, primarily focusing on shaping AI behavior (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022). This "AI-centered" perspective, while foundational, proves insufficient for the complexities of real-world human-AI interaction. As highlighted by the Workshop on Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment, interactions are inherently dynamic, context-dependent, and involve mutual adaptation. Human preferences evolve, task requirements shift, and AI systems themselves learn and change, rendering static alignment brittle and prone to misalignment over time (Gabriel, 2020).

The concept of **bidirectional human-AI alignment** offers a more holistic framework. It encompasses not only aligning AI with human specifications (AI-centered) but also aligning humans with AI systems (human-centered). This latter direction emphasizes preserving human agency, enabling critical evaluation, fostering understanding through interpretability, and supporting effective collaboration (Wang et al., 2021). The inadequacy of unidirectional alignment necessitates a paradigm shift towards systems that can continuously adapt in real-time, engaging in a dynamic co-evolution with their human users. Existing methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), while powerful, often rely on offline preference collection and reward modeling (Ouyang et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2024 [#8]; Feng, 2025 [#9]), struggling with the non-stationarity inherent in live human-AI interaction and the challenge of capturing nuanced, evolving preferences instantaneously. Furthermore, the "black-box" nature of many resulting models hinders the human-centered alignment goal of empowering users to understand and steer the AI. Direct alignment methods like KTO (Ethayarajh et al., 2024 [#5]) attempt to simplify the process but still face challenges like likelihood over-optimization (Shi et al., 2024 [#6]; Rafailov et al., 2024 [#7]).

**Research Objectives:**
This research aims to address the limitations of static, unidirectional alignment by developing and evaluating a novel framework for **Dynamic Human-AI Co-Adaptation**. The core idea is to enable continuous, real-time, bidirectional alignment through the synergistic integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) and interpretable human feedback mechanisms. The specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Real-Time Bidirectional Alignment Framework:** Design and implement a system architecture that combines online RL (specifically, adapting algorithms like PPO) with mechanisms for processing diverse, real-time human feedback (e.g., natural language corrections, preference ratings, implicit signals).
2.  **Enable Dynamic AI Adaptation:** Implement an online RL agent capable of incrementally updating its policy based on continuous user feedback, effectively adapting to changing user preferences and contextual shifts while mitigating catastrophic forgetting of core alignment principles.
3.  **Foster Human Understanding and Agency:** Integrate human-centric interpretability methods that explain *how* specific instances of user feedback influence the AI's policy adjustments in real-time, thereby empowering users to understand, trust, and more effectively guide the AI's behavior.
4.  **Address Non-Stationarity:** Investigate and implement strategies, such as a hybrid RL-imitation learning approach or techniques leveraging meta-learning, to balance rapid adaptation to new feedback with the retention of robust, previously learned alignment objectives.
5.  **Empirically Evaluate Co-Adaptation:** Conduct longitudinal user studies in dynamic task environments to rigorously evaluate the framework's effectiveness in maintaining alignment, enhancing user trust and control, enabling co-adaptation, and improving overall human-AI task performance compared to baseline methods.

**Significance:**
This research directly addresses the core challenges and goals outlined by the Workshop on Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment. By moving beyond static, AI-centric approaches, it contributes to a broader, more nuanced understanding of alignment as a dynamic, interactive process. The proposed framework offers a concrete methodology for achieving bidirectional alignment, where AI systems adapt to humans, and humans are empowered to understand and adapt to AI systems through enhanced transparency and control. This work tackles key challenges identified in the literature, including dynamic preferences, the need for true bidirectional adaptation, non-stationarity, and the demand for interpretability (Literature Review Key Challenges).

Successfully developing such a framework would represent a significant advancement in human-AI interaction, potentially leading to AI systems that are more trustworthy, effective, and safely deployable in complex, real-world settings like collaborative robotics, personalized education, healthcare assistance, and content recommendation. Furthermore, by fostering interdisciplinary synergy between ML (online RL, interpretability) and HCI (interaction design, user evaluation), this research aligns with the workshop's goal of promoting cross-domain collaboration. The findings will provide valuable insights into designing resilient, context-aware, and human-centric AI systems, contributing both theoretically and practically to the future of human-AI alignment.

**3. Methodology**

This research will employ a constructive research methodology, involving the design, implementation, and empirical evaluation of the proposed Dynamic Human-AI Co-Adaptation framework.

**Conceptual Framework:**
The framework operates on the principle of a continuous interactive loop (Figure 1 - *conceptual diagram, not rendered here*).
1.  The AI system (e.g., a robot assistant, a recommender) takes actions within an environment based on its current policy $\pi_\theta$.
2.  The human user observes the AI's actions and the resulting state changes.
3.  The user provides real-time feedback $f_t$ regarding the AI's behavior or the desired outcome. This feedback can be multimodal (e.g., explicit preference statements, corrective instructions via text/voice, ratings, implicit signals like hesitation time or corrective actions).
4.  The feedback $f_t$ is processed and used to update the AI's policy $\pi_\theta$ via an online RL mechanism.
5.  Simultaneously, the system generates a human-centric explanation $e_t$ that communicates how the feedback $f_t$ influenced the policy update $\Delta\theta_t$.
6.  The user receives this explanation, enhancing their understanding and ability to provide more effective future feedback.
7.  The AI acts based on the updated policy $\pi_{\theta + \Delta\theta_{t}}$, continuing the loop.

**Data Collection and Interaction:**
Human interaction data and feedback will be collected through carefully designed user studies. We plan to leverage or adapt frameworks like SHARPIE (AydÄ±n et al., 2025 [#1]) to facilitate the deployment of experiments involving human participants interacting with RL agents.
*   **Feedback Modalities:** We will initially focus on explicit feedback:
    *   Preference comparisons (e.g., "Action A was better than Action B").
    *   Scalar ratings (e.g., "Rate the usefulness of the last action from 1-5").
    *   Corrective natural language instructions (e.g., "Next time, pick up the object more gently").
*   **Interface:** A web-based interface (potentially building on SHARPIE) will allow users to interact with the AI agent in a simulated task environment and provide feedback through dedicated widgets. It will also display the explanations generated by the system.
*   **Logging:** Detailed logs of AI states, actions, received feedback, policy updates, generated explanations, and user interactions will be recorded for analysis.

**Algorithmic Details:**

*   **Online RL Component:** We propose using an online variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017; OpenAI, 2025 [#10]) due to its stability and effectiveness in continuous control tasks and its common use in RLHF (Huang et al., 2024 [#8]; Feng, 2025 [#9]). The environment will be modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to account for potential dynamic changes unknown to the agent, $M = (S, A, T, R, \Omega, O, \gamma)$, where $S$ is the set of states, $A$ actions, $T$ transitions, $R$ the intrinsic task reward (potentially sparse), $\Omega$ observations, $O$ observation probabilities, and $\gamma$ the discount factor. The human feedback $f_t$ will be used to shape an auxiliary reward signal $R_{human}(s, a, f_t)$ or directly influence the value function/advantage estimation used in the PPO update.

    The standard PPO objective is approximately:
    $$L^{CLIP+VF+S}(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t \left[ L_t^{CLIP}(\theta) - c_1 L_t^{VF}(\theta) + c_2 S[\pi_\theta](s_t) \right]$$
    where $L_t^{CLIP}(\theta)$ is the clipped surrogate objective, $L_t^{VF}(\theta)$ is the value function loss $(V_\theta(s_t) - V_t^{targ})^2$, and $S$ is an entropy bonus.

    In our online setting, the target value $V_t^{targ}$ and advantage estimates $\hat{A}_t$ will be influenced by the incoming human feedback $f_t$. For instance, preference feedback ($a_1 \succ a_2$ given $s$) can be modeled using a reward model $R_\phi(s,a)$ trained online (similar to offline RLHF but with incremental updates) or used directly in ranking-based policy updates. Corrective feedback might translate into immediate reward penalties or adjustments to the advantage estimate for the criticized state-action pair:
    $$\hat{A}_t(s_t, a_t | f_t) = (\text{Base Advantage}) + \lambda \cdot \text{FeedbackAdjustment}(f_t)$$
    where $\lambda$ controls the influence of feedback. Updates will be performed frequently based on micro-batches of recent interaction data.

*   **Interpretability Component:** To achieve human-centered alignment, explanations must link specific feedback instances to concrete policy changes. We will explore methods such as:
    *   **Influence Functions:** Approximating the effect of removing a specific feedback instance ($f_t$) on the policy parameters $\theta$.
    *   **Policy Gradient Attribution:** Explaining which parts of the input (state $s_t$, feedback $f_t$) contributed most to the gradient update $\Delta\theta_t$.
    *   **Rule-Based Approximations:** Generating simplified, symbolic rules that approximate the local policy change resulting from feedback (e.g., "Because you said 'faster', I increased the probability of action X in states like Y").
    The explanation $e_t$ = Explain($f_t, \Delta\theta_t, \pi_\theta$) will be presented in natural language or simple visualizations.

*   **Handling Non-Stationarity (Hybrid RL-IL):** Human preferences can drift, and the task context might change (non-stationarity). Relying solely on immediate feedback for online RL can lead to catastrophic forgetting of stable, desirable behaviors or core safety constraints. We propose a hybrid approach:
    *   **Imitation Learning (IL) Foundation:** Pre-train or periodically update a base policy $\pi_{base}$ using a dataset of expert demonstrations or established "safe/aligned" behaviors via techniques like Behavioral Cloning (BC) or GAIL.
    *   **Online RL Adaptation:** Use the online RL component (PPO) to fine-tune this base policy based on real-time human feedback. The RL objective can be regularized to stay close to the base policy, balancing adaptation with stability:
        $$L_{total}(\theta) = L^{PPO}(\theta | f_t) + \beta D_{KL}(\pi_\theta || \pi_{base})$$
        Here, $\beta$ controls the regularization strength. The base policy itself might be slowly updated based on consistent feedback trends over longer timescales, representing a more stable shift in alignment. This addresses the need to retain prior alignment while adapting to new data.

**Experimental Design:**

*   **Task Domains:** We will select two dynamic task domains:
    1.  **Simulated Collaborative Robotics:** A human user guides a simulated robotic arm to perform assembly or manipulation tasks where optimal strategy changes based on implicit user preferences (e.g., speed vs. precision, preferred order) or unexpected environment changes (e.g., object slipping).
    2.  **Personalized News Recommender:** A system recommends articles to a user whose interests may evolve over several sessions. Feedback involves article ratings and potentially natural language instructions about desired topic shifts.
*   **Participants:** We aim to recruit 40-50 participants for longitudinal studies (e.g., 3-5 sessions per participant) to observe adaptation over time. Participants will be screened for basic familiarity with the task domains. Informed consent will be obtained, and ethical guidelines will be strictly followed.
*   **Conditions:** We will compare the proposed **Dynamic Co-Adaptation Framework (DCAF)** against baseline conditions:
    1.  **Static RLHF:** An agent trained offline using batch preferences collected initially, then deployed without further online updates.
    2.  **Online RL (No Explanations):** Our online RL component receiving real-time feedback but without the interpretability module providing explanations to the user.
    3.  **(Optional) RLAIF:** An agent using AI-generated feedback (e.g., based on an LLM like in Lee et al., 2023 [#4]) if resources permit, adapted for online use.
*   **Procedure:** Participants will interact with the AI agent in their assigned condition over multiple sessions. They will perform the task collaboratively with the AI, provide feedback as needed/prompted, and (in the DCAF condition) receive explanations. Data on task performance and user experience will be collected during and after each session.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **AI Alignment & Performance:**
        *   Task Success Rate / Performance Score (domain-specific).
        *   Alignment Score: Measure deviation from inferred ground-truth user preferences (potentially elicited post-hoc or using held-out preferences). Compare this across sessions to track dynamic alignment.
        *   Feedback Efficiency: Task improvement per unit of feedback provided.
    *   **Human Experience & Alignment:**
        *   User Trust: Measured using validated questionnaires (e.g., Scale by Jian et al., 2000).
        *   Perceived Control: User ratings on their ability to influence the AI's behavior.
        *   Perceived Interpretability/Understanding: User ratings on the clarity and usefulness of explanations (for DCAF vs. baselines).
        *   Cognitive Load: Measured using scales like NASA-TLX.
        *   User Satisfaction: Overall satisfaction scores.
    *   **Bidirectional Co-Adaptation:**
        *   AI Policy Change Magnitude: Quantify how much the AI policy adapts over sessions.
        *   User Feedback Strategy Change: Analyze if and how user feedback patterns change over time (e.g., becoming more precise, relying more on explanations), possibly indicating user adaptation to the AI's learning process.
        *   Qualitative Analysis: Thematic analysis of user comments and feedback logs to understand the co-adaptation process narratives.
