### Title: Enhancing Model Interpretability via Lagrange Duality in Deep Learning

### Motivation:
Deep learning models, while powerful, often suffer from a lack of interpretability. Understanding how these models make decisions is crucial for applications in healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. Lagrange duality, a well-established principle in convex optimization, offers a promising approach to measure the sensitivity of model outputs to input perturbations. By leveraging this principle, we can develop robust methods to explain deep learning models, thereby addressing the growing need for transparency in AI.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research aims to apply Lagrange duality to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models. The key idea is to use the duality principle to quantify the sensitivity of model predictions to input perturbations, providing insights into the model's decision-making process. The methodology involves:

1. **Formulation of the Dual Problem**: For a given deep learning model \( f \), formulate the Lagrange dual problem to measure the sensitivity of the model's output to input changes.
2. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Analyze the dual objective function to identify critical features that significantly influence the model's predictions.
3. **Interpretation and Visualization**: Develop visual and quantitative tools to interpret the results, providing clear insights into the model's behavior.

Expected outcomes include:

- Improved model interpretability through sensitivity analysis.
- Enhanced understanding of deep learning models' decision-making processes.
- Development of practical tools for model explanation and debugging.

Potential impact:

- Increased trust in AI systems by providing clear explanations of model predictions.
- Facilitating the adoption of deep learning in critical domains requiring transparency and accountability.
- Advancing the field of explainable AI (XAI) by integrating well-established mathematical principles.
