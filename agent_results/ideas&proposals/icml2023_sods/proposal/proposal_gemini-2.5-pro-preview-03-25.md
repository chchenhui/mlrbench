**1. Title:** **Accelerating Black-Box Discrete Sampling and Optimization via Active Graph Neural Surrogate-Guided Generative Flow Networks**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Sampling from complex distributions and optimizing objective functions over large, discrete spaces are fundamental problems with significant implications across diverse scientific and engineering domains. These challenges arise in physics simulations (e.g., sampling equilibrium states of spin glasses), combinatorial optimization (e.g., finding optimal routes or configurations), compiler optimization (e.g., selecting optimal instruction sequences), and increasingly in modern machine learning, particularly with large language models (LLMs) (e.g., conditional text generation, posterior sampling) and protein models (e.g., designing sequences with desired functions) [Bengio et al., 2023a].

While continuous optimization and sampling have benefited greatly from gradient-based methods like stochastic gradient descent and Langevin dynamics, discrete spaces present unique hurdles. The absence of smooth gradients prevents the direct application of many standard techniques. Furthermore, the combinatorial nature of discrete spaces often leads to vast search spaces ($|\mathcal{X}|$) where exhaustive enumeration is impossible. Dependencies between components can be intricate, involving long-range and high-order correlations that are difficult to model and explore efficiently.

Traditional methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can explore discrete spaces but often suffer from slow mixing times, especially when the energy landscape is rugged or contains isolated modes. Recent advances have sought to improve efficiency. Gradient-based MCMC adapts Langevin dynamics to discrete settings, but requires access to or approximations of gradients [Zhang et al., 2022 - *reference inferred*]. Embedding methods map discrete objects to continuous spaces, perform sampling/optimization there, and map back, but finding effective bidirectional mappings that preserve relevant structures is non-trivial [Grathwohl et al., 2021 - *reference inferred*].

Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a promising paradigm for sampling from discrete distributions proportional to a given reward function $R(x)$ [Bengio et al., 2021 - *reference inferred*, Bengio et al., 2023a]. They learn policies to construct objects $x$ sequentially, aiming to sample $x$ with probability proportional to $R(x)$. GFlowNets excel at generating diverse sets of high-reward candidates and have shown strong performance in molecule generation [Zhu et al., 2023], combinatorial optimization [Zhang et al., 2023], latent variable modeling [Hu et al., 2023], and scientific discovery [Bengio et al., 2023a]. However, standard GFlowNets typically require access to the reward function $R(x)$ during training to guide the learning process. When $R(x)$ is a "black-box" function – meaning it can only be evaluated point-wise, potentially at high computational cost, and provides no gradient information – training GFlowNets becomes sample-inefficient, as numerous costly evaluations are needed. This limitation hinders their application in domains like *de novo* drug design (where $R(x)$ might be a wet-lab experiment or an expensive simulation), protein engineering, or complex conditional sampling from LLMs where the reward incorporates computationally intensive constraints.

**2.2 Research Gap and Proposed Idea**
There is a critical need for methods that can efficiently sample from and optimize black-box reward functions over large, structured discrete spaces characterized by complex dependencies, while minimizing the number of expensive true reward evaluations. Existing methods either require gradient information, struggle with sample efficiency for black-box objectives, or fail to adequately capture intricate correlations.

We propose a novel framework, **Graph Neural Surrogate-Guided GFlowNets (GNS-GFN)**, designed to address this gap. The core idea is an iterative, closed-loop system that couples a Graph Neural Network (GNN) acting as a surrogate model with a GFlowNet sampler. The GNN learns an approximation $\hat{R}(x)$ of the true black-box reward $R(x)$ and potentially its uncertainty $U(x)$, based on a growing dataset of true evaluations. The GFlowNet uses the cheap-to-evaluate surrogate $\hat{R}(x)$ as its primary reward signal to generate diverse candidate objects $x$. Crucially, an active learning strategy selects a small number of informative candidates generated by the GFlowNet for evaluation using the true, expensive $R(x)$. These new, true data points are used to iteratively refine the GNN surrogate, improving its accuracy, especially in promising or uncertain regions. Simultaneously, the GFlowNet's internal reward landscape is recalibrated using these true evaluations to correct for biases introduced by the potentially inaccurate surrogate. This virtuous cycle allows the GFlowNet to explore the discrete space more effectively, guided by an increasingly accurate surrogate, while drastically reducing the reliance on costly true reward queries.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
This research aims to develop and validate the GNS-GFN framework. The specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop the Integrated GNS-GFN Architecture:** Design and implement the core components:
    *   A GNN architecture suitable for learning surrogate reward functions over graph-structured discrete objects, capable of predicting both reward $\hat{R}(x)$ and uncertainty $U(x)$.
    *   A GFlowNet component capable of generating discrete objects (represented as graphs or sequences transformable into graphs) guided by the GNN surrogate's predictions.
    *   An iterative training procedure that orchestrates the interactions between the GNN, GFlowNet, active learning module, and true reward function evaluations.
2.  **Design an Effective Active Learning Strategy:** Develop and evaluate strategies for selecting which GFlowNet-generated candidates should be queried using the true reward function $R(x)$. The strategy should balance exploration (sampling in uncertain regions) and exploitation (sampling high-predicted-reward regions) to maximize the information gain for refining the surrogate model per query.
3.  **Formulate Surrogate Bias Correction Mechanisms:** Implement methods to recalibrate the GFlowNet sampler using the acquired true reward evaluations, mitigating the negative impact of surrogate inaccuracies and ensuring the GFlowNet targets the true reward distribution $P(x) \propto R(x)$ rather than the surrogate distribution $P(x) \propto \hat{R}(x)$.
4.  **Empirically Validate the Framework:** Rigorously evaluate the GNS-GFN framework on a range of benchmark and realistic black-box discrete sampling and optimization tasks. Compare its performance against relevant baselines in terms of sample efficiency (number of true function evaluations) and the quality/diversity of generated samples or optimized solutions.

**2.4 Significance**
This research addresses a fundamental limitation in discrete space exploration, particularly for expensive black-box functions common in scientific discovery and complex ML systems. By significantly reducing the required number of true function evaluations, GNS-GFN has the potential to:
*   **Accelerate Scientific Discovery:** Speed up processes like drug discovery, materials design, and protein engineering where evaluating candidate designs is a major bottleneck.
*   **Improve Generative Model Control:** Enable more efficient and effective conditional sampling from large models like LLMs or protein sequence generators, where constraints define a complex, black-box reward.
*   **Advance Combinatorial Optimization:** Provide a powerful new tool for solving challenging combinatorial optimization problems where the objective function is non-differentiable or expensive to compute.
*   **Contribute Methodologically:** Offer a novel synergetic framework combining generative models (GFlowNets), surrogate modeling (GNNs), and active learning, providing insights applicable to other areas involving expensive function optimization or sampling.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework**
The GNS-GFN framework operates iteratively. Let $R(x)$ be the true black-box reward function for a discrete object $x \in \mathcal{X}$, and let $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_i, R(x_i))\}$ be the dataset of known true evaluations, initially small $\mathcal{D}_0$. Each iteration proceeds as follows:

1.  **Surrogate Model Training:** Train (or fine-tune) the GNN surrogate model $\mathcal{M}_{GNN}(\cdot; \theta)$ on the current dataset $\mathcal{D}$ to approximate $R(x)$ and estimate uncertainty $U(x)$.
    $$ (\hat{R}(x), U(x)) = \mathcal{M}_{GNN}(G_x; \theta) $$
    Minimize a suitable loss, e.g., Mean Squared Error for $\hat{R}(x)$ and potentially a variance prediction loss or using methods like Deep Ensembles for $U(x)$.
    $$ \theta^* = \arg \min_{\theta} \sum_{(x_i, R(x_i)) \in \mathcal{D}} \mathcal{L}_{surrogate}(\mathcal{M}_{GNN}(G_{x_i}; \theta), R(x_i)) $$
2.  **GFlowNet Sampling:** Train (or update) the GFlowNet sampler $\mathcal{M}_{GFN}(\cdot; \phi)$ to generate objects $x$ with probability $P_{\phi}(x) \approx P^*(x) \propto R_{eff}(x)$. The effective reward $R_{eff}(x)$ used for GFlowNet training combines the surrogate prediction $\hat{R}(x)$ with known true values:
    $$ R_{eff}(x) = \begin{cases} R(x) & \text{if } x \in \{x_i | (x_i, R(x_i)) \in \mathcal{D}\} \\ \hat{R}(x; \theta^*) & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$
    GFlowNet training minimizes a loss like Trajectory Balance:
    $$ \phi^* = \arg \min_{\phi} \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim P_F(\tau|s_0; \phi)} \left[ \left( \log Z + \sum_{(s \to s') \in \tau} \log P_F(s'|s; \phi) - \log R_{eff}(x) - \sum_{(s \to s') \in \tau} \log P_B(s|s'; \phi) \right)^2 \right] $$
    where $\tau = (s_0 \to s_1 \to \dots \to s_n=x)$ is a trajectory, $P_F$ and $P_B$ are the forward and backward policies, and $Z$ is the estimated partition function. After training/updating, use the GFlowNet's forward policy $P_F(\cdot; \phi^*)$ to generate a batch of candidate objects $\mathcal{X}_{cand}$.
3.  **Active Learning Selection:** Use the trained GNN surrogate $\mathcal{M}_{GNN}(\cdot; \theta^*)$ to predict $(\hat{R}(x), U(x))$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}_{cand}$. Apply an acquisition function $A(x) = f(\hat{R}(x), U(x))$ to score candidates. Select a small batch $\mathcal{X}_{select} \subset \mathcal{X}_{cand}$ of size $k$ with the highest acquisition scores.
4.  **True Reward Evaluation:** Query the expensive black-box function $R(x)$ for each $x \in \mathcal{X}_{select}$.
5.  **Dataset Augmentation:** Add the newly evaluated pairs $\{(x, R(x)) | x \in \mathcal{X}_{select}\}$ to the dataset $\mathcal{D}$.
6.  **Repeat:** Go back to Step 1 for the next iteration.

**3.2 Data Representation**
We assume discrete objects $x$ can be represented as graphs $G_x = (V_x, E_x)$, where nodes $V_x$ represent components and edges $E_x$ represent relationships. This is natural for molecules, materials, and many combinatorial problems. For sequential data like text or protein sequences, graph representations can be constructed (e.g., k-mer graphs, graphs based on predicted secondary structure, or simply linear graphs). Adapters will be developed based on the specific domain.

**3.3 Graph Neural Network Surrogate Model**
*   **Architecture:** We will primarily use Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) [Gilmer et al., 2017 - *reference inferred*] due to their flexibility and strong performance on graph-structured data. The node embeddings $h_v$ will be updated iteratively:
    $$ m_{uv}^{(l+1)} = \text{MESSAGE}^{(l)}(h_u^{(l)}, h_v^{(l)}, e_{uv}) $$
    $$ h_v^{(l+1)} = \text{UPDATE}^{(l)} \left( h_v^{(l)}, \sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} m_{uv}^{(l+1)} \right) $$
    After $L$ layers, a graph-level readout function (e.g., sum or mean pooling followed by an MLP) will produce the predicted reward $\hat{R}(x)$ and uncertainty $U(x)$.
    $$ \hat{R}(x), \log U(x)^2 = \text{READOUT} \left( \sum_{v \in V_x} h_v^{(L)} \right) $$
*   **Uncertainty Estimation:** We will primarily investigate Deep Ensembles [Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017 - *reference inferred*]. We train $M$ independent GNN models with different initializations on $\mathcal{D}$. The predicted reward is the ensemble mean $\hat{R}(x) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \hat{R}_m(x)$, and the uncertainty $U(x)$ is estimated by the ensemble variance $U(x)^2 \approx \text{Var}(\{\hat{R}_m(x)\}_{m=1}^M)$. This provides a robust measure of model disagreement, often correlating with regions where the surrogate is inaccurate.
*   **Training:** The ensemble models are trained independently by minimizing the negative log-likelihood assuming a Gaussian distribution, which corresponds to minimizing MSE for the mean prediction.

**3.4 GFlowNet Sampler**
*   **State and Action Space:** The state space $\mathcal{S}$ will consist of partially constructed graphs (or sequences). Actions $\mathcal{A}$ will correspond to adding nodes, adding edges, selecting node/edge types, or a special 'terminate' action. The specific design will be task-dependent (e.g., node addition then edge connection for molecules, token appending for sequences).
*   **Policy Parameterization:** The forward $P_F(s'|s; \phi)$ and backward $P_B(s|s'; \phi)$ policies will be parameterized using neural networks (e.g., GNNs if the state $s$ is a graph, or MLPs/Transformers for sequence states) operating on representations of the current state $s$.
*   **Training Objective:** We will primarily use the Trajectory Balance (TB) loss [Malkin et al., 2022 - *reference inferred*] as shown in equation (3), due to its stability and effectiveness. The reward $R_{eff}(x)$ used in equation (3) will be defined as in equation (2), leveraging both true values and surrogate predictions. This adaptively guides the GFlowNet towards the true reward landscape as more data becomes available.

**3.5 Active Learning Strategy**
The acquisition function $A(x)$ guides the selection of points for true evaluation. We will investigate and compare several strategies:
*   **Uncertainty Sampling (US):** Select points with the highest predicted uncertainty $U(x)$. $A(x) = U(x)$.
*   **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** Balance exploration and exploitation. $A(x) = \hat{R}(x) + \beta U(x)$, where $\beta$ is a hyperparameter controlling the trade-off.
*   **Probability of Improvement (PI) / Expected Improvement (EI):** Focus on points likely to improve upon the best currently known reward $R_{best} = \max_{(x_i, R(x_i)) \in \mathcal{D}} R(x_i)$. These require estimating a distribution for $R(x)$ given $\hat{R}(x)$ and $U(x)$ (e.g., Gaussian).
*   **Diversity-Enhanced Selection:** To avoid querying similar points, combine an acquisition function with a diversity metric (e.g., select points maximizing $A(x)$ while maintaining a minimum distance in the object space $\mathcal{X}$ or embedding space to previously selected points).

The choice of $k$ (batch size for active learning) will be studied; smaller $k$ allows for faster feedback loops, while larger $k$ might leverage batch processing capabilities.

**3.6 Experimental Design**
*   **Tasks & Datasets:**
    1.  **Combinatorial Optimization (Graph-based):** Maximum Independent Set (MIS) or Max-Clique on benchmark graph datasets (e.g., DIMACS). $R(x)$ is the size of the valid independent set/clique represented by $x$. This tests handling of graph structures and hard constraints.
    2.  **Molecule Optimization (Sequence/Graph-based):** Generating molecules (represented as SMILES strings or graphs) that maximize a black-box property (e.g., penalized logP from RDKit, or a computationally expensive docking score against a specific protein target using AutoDock Vina). This benchmarks performance on real-world scientific discovery tasks. We will use standard molecule generation benchmarks like GuacaMol [Brown et al., 2019 - *reference inferred*] for evaluating distribution learning aspects and specific optimization objectives.
    3.  **Conditional Text Generation (Sequence-based):** Sampling sentences from a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-2) that satisfy certain constraints (e.g., positive sentiment score from a classifier + presence of specific keywords). $R(x)$ = LM probability * Constraint satisfaction score (where constraint score is black-box or expensive). This tests applicability to large, pre-trained models.
*   **Baselines:** We will compare GNS-GFN against:
    1.  **Standard GFlowNet:** Trained only on the initial seed dataset $\mathcal{D}_0$.
    2.  **GFlowNet + Random Acquisition:** GNS-GFN framework but selecting points randomly instead of via active learning.
    3.  **Bayesian Optimization (BO):** Using standard BO with GNN/GP surrogates and common acquisition functions (e.g., EI, UCB). This requires adapting BO to the discrete/graph domain, possibly via graph kernels or graph representation learning embeddings.
    4.  **Random Sampling:** Evaluating randomly chosen points $x \in \mathcal{X}$.
    5.  **Simulated Annealing / MCMC:** Standard black-box optimization/sampling techniques.
    6.  **Local Search GFlowNet:** [Kim et al., 2023] If applicable, adapting it to the black-box setting potentially using the surrogate.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Sample Efficiency:** Primary metric: Plot of the best reward found (for optimization) or distribution quality metric (for sampling, e.g., KL divergence, diversity scores) as a function of the number of true black-box evaluations $|D|$.
    *   **Optimization Performance:** The maximum reward $R(x)$ found within a fixed budget of true evaluations.
    *   **Sampling Quality:** For sampling tasks: KL divergence to the true distribution (if tractable, e.g., on small synthetic problems), Forward KL ($KL(P_{true}||P_{gen})$), Reverse KL ($KL(P_{gen}||P_{true})$), Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Minimum energy found across samples.
    *   **Diversity:** Metrics like pairwise distance distribution among generated samples, or number of unique modes found. For molecules: Validity, Uniqueness, Novelty.
    *   **Computational Cost:** Wall-clock time (separating true evaluation time from model training time).

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**
*   **A Novel Algorithm (GNS-GFN):** We expect to deliver a robust and well-documented implementation of the GNS-GFN framework, integrating GNN surrogates, GFlowNets, and active learning.
*   **Demonstrated Sample Efficiency:** We anticipate empirical results showing that GNS-GFN significantly outperforms baseline methods (standard GFlowNets, random sampling, standard BO) in terms of the number of true black-box function evaluations required to achieve high-quality solutions or representative samples across all tested domains (combinatorial optimization, molecule design, conditional text generation). We hypothesize achieving similar performance with potentially an order of magnitude fewer true evaluations compared to non-active or standard GFlowNet approaches.
*   **Effectiveness of Active Learning:** We expect to identify which active learning strategies (UCB, Uncertainty Sampling, etc.) are most effective within this framework and quantify their benefit over random selection.
*   **Validation on Diverse Tasks:** Successful application of GNS-GFN to tasks with varying structure (graphs, sequences) and reward landscapes, demonstrating the versatility of the approach.
*   **Analysis of Surrogate-Sampler Interaction:** Insights into how the GNN surrogate's accuracy and uncertainty estimates influence the GFlowNet's exploration strategy and how the recalibration mechanism corrects for surrogate bias over time.

**4.2 Potential Impact**
*   **Advancing Black-Box Optimization/Sampling:** GNS-GFN could become a state-of-the-art method for sample-efficient exploration of complex, discrete, black-box spaces, addressing a key bottleneck in many fields.
*   **Enabling Scientific Discovery:** By drastically reducing the cost associated with evaluating potential candidates, this work can accelerate discovery cycles in drug design, materials science, and synthetic biology, where simulations or experiments are expensive.
*   **Enhancing AI Capabilities:** The framework could improve the controllability and fine-tuning of large generative models (LLMs, protein models) for specific downstream tasks defined by complex, non-differentiable objectives, making them more versatile and useful.
*   **Methodological Contributions:** This research contributes a novel synthesis of ideas from generative modeling (GFlowNets), representation learning (GNNs), and active learning. The insights gained about surrogate-guided generative processes could inspire further developments in AI-driven optimization, experimental design, and reinforcement learning.

In conclusion, the proposed GNS-GFN framework offers a principled and potentially highly effective approach to tackle the challenging problem of black-box discrete sampling and optimization. By intelligently coupling surrogate modeling, generative sampling, and active learning, this research promises to significantly enhance our ability to navigate vast, complex discrete landscapes where function evaluations are a precious resource.
