# Adaptive Spectral Partitioning for Efficient Discrete Space Sampling

## Motivation
Sampling in high-dimensional discrete spaces faces efficiency challenges due to complex correlations and vast search spaces. Current methods like gradient-based MCMC or continuous embedding techniques struggle with black-box objectives or capturing long-range dependencies present in modern language models and protein structures. These limitations hinder progress in crucial applications like protein design, language model conditioning, and combinatorial optimization. A new approach is needed that can dynamically adapt to the underlying structure of discrete spaces without requiring gradient information.

## Main Idea
I propose Adaptive Spectral Partitioning (ASP), a hierarchical sampling framework that recursively partitions the discrete space based on spectral properties of samples. ASP constructs a low-rank approximation of the sampling distribution by monitoring correlations between variables through online spectral decomposition of the covariance matrix. The algorithm adaptively identifies clusters of highly correlated variables and performs block sampling within these clusters while maintaining independence assumptions between blocks. This approach effectively captures long-range dependencies by dynamically adjusting partitioning based on emerging correlation patterns. ASP incorporates a multi-temperature scheme to balance exploration and exploitation, enabling efficient traversal of rugged energy landscapes. The method requires no gradient information and can automatically identify the effective dimensionality of the problem, making it particularly suitable for black-box objectives in language modeling and protein design applications.
