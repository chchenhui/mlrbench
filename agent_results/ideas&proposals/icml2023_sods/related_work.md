**Key Challenges:**

1. **Surrogate Model Accuracy**: Ensuring the graph neural network surrogate accurately approximates the true objective function is critical. Inaccurate surrogates can mislead the GFlowNet sampler, resulting in suboptimal exploration and exploitation.

2. **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation**: Effectively managing the trade-off between exploring new regions of the discrete space and exploiting known high-reward areas remains challenging. Over-exploration can lead to inefficiency, while over-exploitation may cause the model to miss better solutions.

3. **Handling High-Order Correlations**: Capturing and modeling long-range, high-order correlations in discrete spaces, such as those present in language models and protein design, is complex. Existing methods often struggle to represent these intricate dependencies accurately.

4. **Computational Efficiency**: The iterative framework involving surrogate updates and GFlowNet sampling can be computationally intensive. Developing methods to reduce computational overhead without compromising performance is essential.

5. **Active Learning Strategy**: Designing effective active learning strategies to select which proposals to evaluate on the true objective is crucial. Poor selection can lead to inefficient learning and slow convergence.
