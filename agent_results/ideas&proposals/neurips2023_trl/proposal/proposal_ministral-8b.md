# Structure-Aware Dual-Stream Pretraining for Robust Tabular Language Models

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Tabular data, represented in formats like CSV or SQL, is ubiquitous in data management and analysis pipelines. Despite its dominant presence, tabular data has been largely overlooked in the realm of representation learning and generative models. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in tasks like semantic parsing, question answering, and table understanding, but they often struggle with complex table structures, such as nested headers and sparse relations. Existing pretraining methods primarily focus on content, ignoring the explicit structural semantics of tables. This limitation hampers the utility of LLMs in real-world applications involving heterogeneous schemas. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-stream transformer architecture that jointly encodes tabular content and structural metadata, enhancing the robustness and effectiveness of LLMs in tabular data tasks.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. To develop a dual-stream transformer model that explicitly incorporates structural semantics of tabular data.
2. To pretrain the model on tasks that encourage the joint learning of content and structure, enhancing its ability to reason over diverse schemas.
3. To evaluate the proposed model on benchmark datasets and compare its performance with state-of-the-art methods.

### Significance

The proposed method aims to bridge the gap between content-focused and structure-aware approaches in tabular data representation learning. By explicitly modeling table topology, the framework enhances LLMsâ€™ ability to interpret complex table structures, leading to improved performance on tasks like text-to-SQL and data QA. The broader impact includes advancements in data-driven NLP systems requiring precise table comprehension, fostering collaboration across the NLP, ML, IR, and DB communities.

## 2. Methodology

### Detailed Research Design

#### 2.1. Model Architecture

The proposed model, Structure-Aware Dual-Stream Pretraining for Robust Tabular Language Models (SAD-TRL), consists of two streams: a content stream and a structure stream.

**Content Stream:**
- **Tokenization:** Cell values are tokenized using a tokenizer that incorporates structural position embeddings to capture the spatial relationships within the table.
- **Embedding Layer:** Tokenized cell values are passed through an embedding layer that maps tokens to dense vector representations.
- **Positional Encoding:** Structural position embeddings are added to the token embeddings to encode the spatial relationships between cells.

**Structure Stream:**
- **Schema Graph:** A learnable schema graph is constructed to represent the table structure, with nodes corresponding to columns and edges representing relationships between columns.
- **Graph Embedding Layer:** Nodes and edges in the schema graph are embedded using a graph embedding layer that captures the hierarchical relationships between columns.
- **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN):** The schema graph is processed using a GCN to propagate structural information through the graph, emphasizing the importance of key relationships.

**Dual-Stream Integration:**
- **Cross-Stream Alignment:** The outputs of the content and structure streams are aligned using a cross-stream attention mechanism that matches SQL queries to schema subgraphs, facilitating joint learning of content and structure.

#### 2.2. Pretraining Tasks

The model is pretrained on three tasks designed to encourage the joint learning of content and structure:

1. **Masked Cell Recovery:**
    - A fraction of cell values in the table are masked, and the model is trained to predict the masked values based on the surrounding context and structural information.
    - **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy loss on the predicted cell values.

2. **Schema Relation Prediction:**
    - The model is trained to predict the relationships between columns in the schema graph, such as primary and foreign keys.
    - **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy loss on the predicted relationships.

3. **Cross-Stream Alignment:**
    - The model is trained to match SQL queries to subgraphs in the schema graph, facilitating the alignment of content and structure.
    - **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy loss on the matching predictions.

#### 2.3. Experimental Design

**Dataset:**
- The model is trained and evaluated on a combination of public tabular datasets, including Spider (text-to-SQL), WikiTableQuestions, and others. These datasets cover a range of table structures and complexities, ensuring the robustness of the proposed method.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Text-to-SQL Accuracy:** The accuracy of the generated SQL queries on the Spider dataset.
- **WikiTableQuestions Accuracy:** The accuracy of the model's answers on the WikiTableQuestions dataset.
- **Cross-Validation:** The model is evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure the reliability of the results.

**Baseline Models:**
- The proposed model is compared with state-of-the-art methods, including TabTreeFormer, UniTabE, XTab, TableFormer, TURL, TAPAS, and TaBERT.

### Mathematical Formulas

**Content Stream Embedding:**
\[ \mathbf{E}_{\text{content}} = \mathbf{E}_{\text{token}} + \mathbf{E}_{\text{position}} \]

Where:
- \( \mathbf{E}_{\text{token}} \) is the embedding of the tokenized cell value.
- \( \mathbf{E}_{\text{position}} \) is the positional embedding capturing the spatial relationships.

**Graph Embedding Layer:**
\[ \mathbf{E}_{\text{graph}} = \mathbf{W}_{\text{node}} \mathbf{X}_{\text{node}} + \mathbf{W}_{\text{edge}} \mathbf{X}_{\text{edge}} \]

Where:
- \( \mathbf{X}_{\text{node}} \) and \( \mathbf{X}_{\text{edge}} \) are the input node and edge features.
- \( \mathbf{W}_{\text{node}} \) and \( \mathbf{W}_{\text{edge}} \) are the learnable weight matrices.

**Graph Convolutional Network (GCN):**
\[ \mathbf{H} = \sigma(\mathbf{W} \mathbf{X} + \mathbf{b}) \]

Where:
- \( \mathbf{X} \) is the input graph features.
- \( \mathbf{W} \) and \( \mathbf{b} \) are the learnable weight matrix and bias vector.
- \( \sigma \) is the activation function (e.g., ReLU).

**Cross-Stream Attention:**
\[ \mathbf{A} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}_{\text{content}} \mathbf{K}_{\text{structure}}^T + \mathbf{Q}_{\text{structure}} \mathbf{K}_{\text{content}}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) \]

Where:
- \( \mathbf{Q}_{\text{content}} \) and \( \mathbf{Q}_{\text{structure}} \) are the query matrices for content and structure streams.
- \( \mathbf{K}_{\text{content}} \) and \( \mathbf{K}_{\text{structure}} \) are the key matrices for content and structure streams.
- \( d_k \) is the dimensionality of the key vectors.
