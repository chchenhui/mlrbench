**Structure-Aware Dual-Stream Pretraining for Robust Tabular Language Models**  

---

### 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Tabular data is the backbone of enterprise databases, scientific repositories, and decision-making pipelines. Despite its ubiquity, structured data remains understudied in representation learning compared to text or images. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of language models (LMs) in tabular tasks like text-to-SQL parsing, question answering, and data preparation, but their performance remains brittle when handling tables with complex structures—such as nested headers, sparse cross-table relations, or dynamic schemas. Existing approaches (e.g., TAPAS, TaBERT) primarily tokenize tabular content but inadequately encode structural metadata like column hierarchies, data types, or foreign keys. This limitation hinders their utility in real-world applications, where robust schema comprehension is critical.  

**Research Objectives**  
Our work aims to bridge this gap by introducing a **dual-stream pretraining framework** that jointly models tabular content and structural semantics. The objectives are:  
1. Develop a transformer architecture with separate *content* and *structure* streams to capture cell values and schema metadata.  
2. Design pretraining tasks that enforce alignment between content, schema relations, and downstream task objectives (e.g., SQL generation).  
3. Evaluate the model’s ability to generalize across diverse table schemas and improve robustness in tasks like text-to-SQL and table QA.  

**Significance**  
By explicitly modeling table topology, our framework addresses key challenges in real-world data systems, such as handling heterogeneous schemas and enabling precise data retrieval. Success in this area would advance data-centric NLP applications, including automated data analysis, enterprise knowledge bases, and AI-driven database management.

### 2. Methodology  

**Dual-Stream Architecture**  
The proposed model consists of two parallel transformer encoders:  
- **Content Stream**: Processes tokenized cell values with positional embeddings encoding their *structural coordinates* (row, column, hierarchical level).  
- **Structure Stream**: Encodes schema metadata as a **schema graph** (Figure 1), where nodes represent columns with attributes (data type, header name, primary/foreign keys), and edges denote hierarchical or relational dependencies (e.g., foreign-key links). This graph is processed via a graph attention network (GAT).  

The two streams interact through a cross-attention mechanism to align content tokens with their corresponding schema nodes.  

**Tokenization & Embeddings**  
- **Content Tokenization**: Cell values are split into subwords and embedded as $E_c \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, where $n$ is the token count and $d$ the embedding dimension. Structural positions are encoded via additive embeddings:  
  $$E_{\text{content}} = E_c + E_{\text{row}} + E_{\text{col}} + E_{\text{hier}}$$  
  where $E_{\text{row}}, E_{\text{col}}, E_{\text{hier}}$ are learnable embeddings for row, column, and header hierarchy levels.  
- **Structure Tokenization**: Each column is represented as a node in the schema graph, with initial features derived from metadata (e.g., data type embeddings, header name BERT embeddings).  

**Pretraining Tasks**  
1. **Masked Cell Recovery**: Mask 15% of cell tokens and train the content stream to reconstruct them.  
2. **Schema Relation Prediction**: Mask edges in the schema graph (e.g., foreign keys) and train the structure stream to predict missing relations via edge classification.  
3. **Cross-Stream Alignment**: Contrastive learning ensures that content tokens (e.g., a cell value "Paris") align with their schema nodes (e.g., column "Capital City"). For aligned token-node pairs $(t_i, n_j)$, we minimize:  
   $$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{align}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(t_i, n_j))}{\sum_{k=1}^K \exp(\text{sim}(t_i, n_k))} $$  
   where $\text{sim}$ is cosine similarity.  

**Fine-Tuning for Downstream Tasks**  
For text-to-SQL, the model concatenates the question, content stream output, and structure stream output. A decoder generates SQL queries using schema-aware attention over column nodes.  

**Experimental Design**  
- **Datasets**:  
  - **Spider** (text-to-SQL): 10,181 questions across 200+ databases with complex schemas.  
  - **WikiTableQuestions** (QA): 22,033 questions requiring table entailment.  
  - **TABFACT** (fact verification): 118,439 statements testing table comprehension.  
- **Baselines**: TAPAS, TaBERT, TableFormer, XTab, GPT-4 with table-specific prompting.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Text-to-SQL**: Exact match (EM) and execution accuracy.  
  - **QA**: Accuracy (EM for WikiTableQuestions), F1 for TABFACT.  
  - **Pretraining**: Masked cell accuracy, relation prediction AUC.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Pretrain on 1M tables from WikiSQL-7M and proprietary enterprise schemas.  
  - Use DeBERTa-v3 as the base model; schema graphs processed via 3-layer GAT.  
  - Training: 8x A100 GPUs, AdamW optimizer ($\text{lr}=1e-4$), batch size 128.

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Robustness**: The dual-stream model will outperform baselines on Spider (+5% EM) and WikiTableQuestions (+3% EM) by explicitly modeling schema relations.  
2. **Generalization**: Superior zero-shot performance on unseen database schemas due to structured pretraining.  
3. **Interpretability**: Attention maps visualizing cross-stream alignment will provide insights into model decisions, aiding debugging.  

**Broader Impact**  
- **Enterprise Applications**: Enhanced text-to-SQL systems could democratize data access for non-experts.  
- **Data Preparation**: Improved schema understanding enables automated data cleaning and integration.  
- **Research**: The framework establishes a foundation for joint modeling of content and structure, inspiring future work in multimodal table reasoning.
