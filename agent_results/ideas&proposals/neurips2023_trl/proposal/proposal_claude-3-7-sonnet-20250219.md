# Structure-Aware Dual-Stream Pretraining for Robust Tabular Language Models

## Introduction

Tables are ubiquitous data structures that organize information in rows and columns, serving as the backbone of data management systems, spreadsheets, and databases across virtually all domains. Despite their prevalence—with tabular formats representing the majority of datasets in repositories like Google Dataset Search and dominating data storage in relational database management systems—tables have been underrepresented in the rapid advancement of representation learning and language models.

Recent years have witnessed significant progress in applying transformer-based architectures to tabular data, with models like TAPAS, TaBERT, and TURL demonstrating promising capabilities in tasks such as text-to-SQL, question answering, and table understanding. However, these approaches face persistent challenges when dealing with complex table structures, heterogeneous schemas, and cross-modal reasoning that combines tabular information with other modalities like text or code.

The fundamental challenge lies in the inherent tension between content and structure in tabular data. Current approaches predominantly focus on encoding cell values (content) while treating structural information as secondary, often implementing it through simple position embeddings or flattening tables into sequences that lose critical structural semantics. This content-centric approach fails to capture the rich relational information embedded in table structures, such as hierarchical relationships between headers, primary-foreign key connections, and data type constraints.

This research proposes a novel Structure-Aware Dual-Stream Pretraining framework that explicitly models both content and structural metadata of tables through separate but interacting transformer streams. By treating structure as a first-class citizen in the representational space, we aim to enhance the ability of language models to reason over diverse table schemas and perform complex operations that require understanding both the content and the organizational principles of tabular data.

The primary research objectives of this study are:

1. To develop a dual-stream transformer architecture that separately yet jointly encodes tabular content and structural metadata
2. To design effective pretraining objectives that align content understanding with structural comprehension
3. To evaluate the framework's effectiveness on downstream tasks requiring deep table understanding, such as text-to-SQL generation, table-based question answering, and cross-modal reasoning

The significance of this research extends beyond academic contributions to representation learning. By enhancing language models' ability to interpret and reason over structured data, we enable more accurate and reliable automated data analysis, more intuitive natural language interfaces to databases, and more effective integration of tabular information into multimodal reasoning systems. These capabilities are critical for applications in business intelligence, scientific research, healthcare analytics, and numerous other domains where structured data plays a central role.

## Methodology

### Overview

The Structure-Aware Dual-Stream Pretraining framework consists of three core components: (1) a content stream that processes cell values and associated text, (2) a structure stream that encodes the table's schema and relational properties, and (3) cross-stream interaction mechanisms that align and integrate information between the two representational spaces. The architecture is designed to be compatible with existing transformer-based language models while adding the capacity to explicitly model table structures.

### Model Architecture

#### Content Stream

The content stream follows a modified transformer encoder architecture similar to BERT, but with specialized table-aware position embeddings:

$$E_{content} = E_{token} + E_{position} + E_{structural\_position}$$

where:
- $E_{token}$ represents the token embeddings from a standard language model tokenizer
- $E_{position}$ represents the sequential position in the tokenized input
- $E_{structural\_position}$ encodes the cell's position within the table structure

The structural position embedding combines row and column information:

$$E_{structural\_position} = W_r \cdot E_{row} + W_c \cdot E_{column}$$

where $W_r$ and $W_c$ are learnable weight matrices, and $E_{row}$ and $E_{column}$ are learnable embeddings for each row and column position.

The content stream processes the input through $L$ transformer layers:

$$H^l_{content} = \text{TransformerLayer}(H^{l-1}_{content})$$

with $H^0_{content} = E_{content}$.

#### Structure Stream

The structure stream operates on a graph representation of the table schema, where nodes represent columns/headers and edges represent relationships between them:

$$G = (V, E)$$

where:
- $V = \{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\}$ represents the set of columns
- $E = \{e_{ij}\}$ represents the set of edges between columns, including relationships like "primary key → foreign key", "parent header → child header", etc.

Each node $v_i$ has an initial embedding:

$$E_{v_i} = E_{column\_name} + E_{data\_type} + E_{column\_stats}$$

where:
- $E_{column\_name}$ is the embedding of the column name
- $E_{data\_type}$ is an embedding of the column's data type (e.g., numeric, categorical, text)
- $E_{column\_stats}$ captures statistical properties of the column (e.g., cardinality, null percentage)

The structure stream employs a graph attention network (GAT) to process this schema graph:

$$H^l_v = \text{GAT}(H^{l-1}_v, \{H^{l-1}_u | u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\})$$

where $\mathcal{N}(v)$ represents the neighbors of node $v$ in the schema graph, and:

$$\text{GAT}(h_v, \{h_u\}) = \sigma\left(\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} \alpha_{vu}W h_u\right)$$

with attention coefficients:

$$\alpha_{vu} = \frac{\exp(LeakyReLU(a^T[Wh_v \| Wh_u]))}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}(v)}\exp(LeakyReLU(a^T[Wh_v \| Wh_k]))}$$

#### Cross-Stream Interaction

To enable information flow between the content and structure streams, we employ a cross-attention mechanism:

$$H^l_{content\_enhanced} = H^l_{content} + \text{MultiHead}(H^l_{content}, H^l_v, H^l_v)$$

$$H^l_{structure\_enhanced} = H^l_v + \text{MultiHead}(H^l_v, H^l_{content}, H^l_{content})$$

where $\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V)$ represents the standard multi-head attention operation with query $Q$, keys $K$, and values $V$.

### Pretraining Objectives

We employ multiple pretraining objectives to ensure the model learns both content and structural representations:

1. **Masked Cell Recovery (Content Stream)**
   
   Similar to masked language modeling, randomly mask 15% of cell values and train the model to predict them:
   
   $$\mathcal{L}_{MCR} = -\sum_{i \in \mathcal{M}} \log P(x_i | x_{\backslash\mathcal{M}})$$
   
   where $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of masked token indices.

2. **Schema Relation Prediction (Structure Stream)**
   
   Randomly mask 20% of the edges in the schema graph and train the model to predict the relationship type:
   
   $$\mathcal{L}_{SRP} = -\sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{M}_E} \log P(r_{ij} | G_{\backslash\mathcal{M}_E})$$
   
   where $\mathcal{M}_E$ is the set of masked edges and $r_{ij}$ is the relationship type between nodes $i$ and $j$.

3. **Cross-Stream Alignment**
   
   Train the model to align content representations with their corresponding structural representations:
   
   $$\mathcal{L}_{CSA} = -\sum_{i} \log \frac{\exp(sim(h^{content}_i, h^{structure}_i)/\tau)}{\sum_{j} \exp(sim(h^{content}_i, h^{structure}_j)/\tau)}$$
   
   where $sim(a, b) = a^T b / (||a|| \cdot ||b||)$ is the cosine similarity and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.

4. **SQL-Schema Alignment**
   
   For tables with corresponding SQL queries, train the model to match SQL queries with the relevant subgraphs in the schema:
   
   $$\mathcal{L}_{SSA} = -\sum_{q} \log P(S_q | q, G)$$
   
   where $q$ is a SQL query and $S_q$ is the set of schema elements referenced in the query.

The total pretraining loss is a weighted sum of these objectives:

$$\mathcal{L} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{MCR} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{SRP} + \gamma \mathcal{L}_{CSA} + \delta \mathcal{L}_{SSA}$$

where $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\delta$ are hyperparameters controlling the relative importance of each objective.

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

To ensure the model learns from diverse table structures, we will curate a large-scale dataset of tables from multiple sources:

1. **Public Databases**: Wikipedia tables, government open data portals, scientific datasets
2. **Relational Database Dumps**: Public database dumps from open-source projects
3. **Spreadsheets**: Public spreadsheet collections with varied layouts and structures
4. **Synthetic Tables**: Programmatically generated tables with controlled structural complexity

For each table, we extract and represent structural metadata including:
- Column names and data types
- Primary and foreign key relationships
- Header hierarchies and nesting levels
- Table statistics (row/column counts, sparsity, etc.)

Tables are preprocessed to handle common challenges:
- Missing values are marked with special tokens
- Merged cells are expanded with appropriate metadata
- Nested headers are represented in the schema graph with hierarchical relationships

### Training Procedure

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the content stream with pretrained weights from a language model (e.g., RoBERTa), while randomly initializing the structure stream.

2. **Pretraining**: Train the dual-stream model on the pretraining objectives using a curriculum that gradually increases table complexity:
   - Start with simple, flat tables with clear schemas
   - Progress to more complex structures (e.g., nested headers, sparse relationships)
   - Finally incorporate tables with ambiguous or implicit structure

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Batch size: 32 tables per GPU
   - Optimizer: AdamW with learning rate 2e-5
   - Gradient accumulation over 4 steps
   - Training for 500,000 steps
   - Mixed precision training (FP16)
   - Distributed training across 8 GPUs

### Experimental Design

We will evaluate our model on several downstream tasks requiring table understanding:

1. **Text-to-SQL (Spider Dataset)**
   - Task: Generate SQL queries from natural language questions
   - Metrics: Exact match accuracy, execution accuracy
   - Baseline Comparison: TAPAS, TaBERT, and recent LLM-based approaches

2. **Table Question Answering (WikiTableQuestions, TabFact)**
   - Task: Answer questions about table content
   - Metrics: EM, F1 score, accuracy
   - Baseline Comparison: TAPAS, TableFormer, TabTreeFormer

3. **Schema Matching and Table Alignment**
   - Task: Match columns across different tables with similar semantics
   - Metrics: Precision, recall, F1 score
   - Baseline Comparison: Sato, UniTabE

4. **Table Augmentation and Completion**
   - Task: Predict missing values or suggest additional columns
   - Metrics: Prediction accuracy, BLEU score for text generation
   - Baseline Comparison: XTab, TabNet

5. **Robustness Analysis**
   We will specifically evaluate model robustness across:
   - Tables with varying levels of structural complexity
   - Tables with schema inconsistencies or errors
   - Tables from entirely unseen domains
   - Tables with different formatting conventions

### Ablation Studies

To understand the contribution of each component, we will conduct ablation studies by:
1. Removing the structure stream entirely
2. Using only simple positional embeddings instead of the schema graph
3. Eliminating each pretraining objective individually
4. Varying the complexity of the schema graph representation

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

The Structure-Aware Dual-Stream Pretraining framework is expected to deliver several key outcomes:

1. **State-of-the-art performance** on complex table understanding tasks, particularly those requiring structural reasoning, such as text-to-SQL and cross-table alignment. We anticipate at least 5-8% improvement on exact match accuracy for the Spider dataset and similar gains on WikiTableQuestions compared to current best models.

2. **Enhanced robustness** to table structure variations, with significantly smaller performance degradation (at least 40% less) when presented with complex, nested, or sparse table structures compared to existing approaches.

3. **Improved generalization** to unseen schemas and domains, demonstrating the model's ability to adapt to new table structures without extensive fine-tuning.

4. **More accurate structural reasoning** for tasks that require understanding table semantics beyond cell content, such as identifying foreign key relationships or mapping between different schemas.

5. **Better integration** with other modalities, particularly text and code, as demonstrated by performance on cross-modal tasks like text-to-SQL generation.

The impact of this research extends beyond technical improvements, with several broader implications:

1. **Enabling more natural human-data interaction**: By improving language models' understanding of structured data, we make natural language interfaces to databases more reliable and intuitive for non-technical users.

2. **Advancing automated data preparation**: Better table understanding can streamline data cleaning, integration, and feature engineering processes, reducing the most time-consuming aspects of data science workflows.

3. **Enhancing data discovery and integration**: Improved table representation learning can facilitate finding, matching, and integrating related datasets across repositories.

4. **Supporting multimodal reasoning systems**: As AI systems increasingly need to reason across structured and unstructured data, our framework provides a foundation for integrating tabular information into broader reasoning processes.

This research fills a critical gap in representation learning by elevating structural understanding to equal importance with content understanding. While current approaches treat table structure as an afterthought, our dual-stream architecture explicitly models the rich relational information embedded in tables. This paradigm shift could inspire similar approaches in other domains where structure and content are equally important, such as knowledge graphs, scientific papers, and code repositories.
