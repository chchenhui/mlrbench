# TabAlign: A Contrastive Learning Framework for Table Semantic Alignment

## Motivation
Tables are ubiquitous in data ecosystems, yet understanding semantic relationships between tables remains challenging. Current approaches struggle with heterogeneous schemas, format inconsistencies, and domain-specific terminology. This research addresses a critical need in data integration and discovery by developing a robust method for identifying semantically related tables across datasets with minimal supervision. This capability is fundamental for improving data cataloging, enabling efficient data search, and facilitating knowledge discovery across organizational data silos.

## Main Idea
TabAlign introduces a novel contrastive learning framework specifically designed for table representation learning that captures semantic relationships between tables regardless of structural differences. The approach embeds entire tables as vectors in a semantic space where related tables cluster together. Our method employs a dual-encoder architecture with table-specific attention mechanisms that focus on key columns, headers, and data distributions rather than relying solely on textual content. By learning from positive pairs (semantically related tables) and negative pairs (unrelated tables), TabAlign creates robust representations that generalize across domains. We incorporate weak supervision signals from existing metadata and schema matching tools to bootstrap the learning process. The framework will be evaluated on cross-domain table retrieval tasks and demonstrated in practical applications including automated data discovery, schema matching, and dataset recommendation systems.
