**Title:** Graph-Enhanced Cross-Modal Alignment for Multimodal Table-Text Understanding  

**Motivation:** Tabular data and text are frequently co-analyzed in domains like healthcare or finance, yet models often struggle to bridge structured tables with unstructured text. Existing methods flatten tables or use simplistic tokenization, losing relational semantics. This limits progress in tasks like text-to-SQL, table QA, and fact-checking, where accurate cross-modal alignment is critical.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a graph-enhanced framework that jointly represents tables and text in a shared embedding space. Tables are encoded using a heterogeneous graph neural network to capture row-column hierarchies, foreign key relationships, and metadata. Text is processed via a transformer to extract contextual semantics. A cross-modal attention module aligns table subgraphs with textual phrases through contrastive learning, ensuring that related entities (e.g., "patient" in a table and "their medical history" in text) share affinity. The model pre-trains on large-scale table-text pairs (e.g., Wikipedia infoboxes with article text) and fine-tunes on downstream tasks like multi-hop reasoning or retrieval. Expected outcomes include improved state-of-the-art results on benchmarks (WikiTQ, HybridQA) and robustness to heterogeneous table structures. This approach bridges NLP and multimodal structured data understanding, enabling applications like interactive data analysis assistants and context-aware data search.
