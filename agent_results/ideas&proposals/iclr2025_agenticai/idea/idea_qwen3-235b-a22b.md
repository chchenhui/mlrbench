**Title:** Hierarchical Knowledge-Graph-Enhanced Multi-Agent Systems for End-to-End Hypothesis Discovery  

**Motivation:**  
Automating scientific hypothesis generation requires seamless integration of diverse tasks—from literature synthesis to experimental validation—but current AI systems often operate in silos, limiting their collaborative potential. Existing efforts like ChemCrow and Crispr-GPT excel in domain-specific tasks but lack mechanisms to unify hypothesis formulation, testing, and validation in a dynamic framework. This fragmentation hinders reproducibility and scalability. A holistic approach connecting specialized agents via a shared knowledge structure could bridge this gap, enabling real-time feedback loops and cross-disciplinary innovation.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a multi-agent framework where **specialized AI agents** (e.g., hypothesis generation, experimental design, data analysis) operate in a hierarchical workflow, coordinated by a **dynamic scientific knowledge graph (SKG)**. Each agent autonomously performs its task, updates the SKG with structured findings (using graph neural networks), and retrieves prior knowledge during execution. The SKG enforces consistency via physics-informed constraints and probabilistic rules, resolving contradictions between agents. A **human-in-the-loop module** allows domain experts to validate critical nodes in the SKG, reducing hallucinations. Methodologically, agents will integrate prompt-based reasoning with fine-tuned domain-specific models (e.g., chemistry diffusion models, biomedical NER), while the SKG leverages temporal graph embeddings to track hypothesis evolution. Evaluation will use metrics like reproducibility score (alignment with prior literature) and novelty index (cross-domain derivations).  

**Impact:** This system could accelerate discovery cycles, reduce experimental redundancies, and enable cross-domain analogies, setting a standard for robust, human-AI collaborative scientific workflows.
