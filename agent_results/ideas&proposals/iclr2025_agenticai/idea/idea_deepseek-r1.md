**Title:** Dynamic Multi-Agent Frameworks for Cross-Domain Scientific Hypothesis Generation  

**Motivation:** Scientific discovery increasingly relies on interdisciplinary insights, but existing AI systems struggle to integrate expertise across domains. A dynamic, collaborative multi-agent approach can decompose complex problems, leverage specialized knowledge, and enhance hypothesis generation while maintaining interpretability and human oversight.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a framework where specialized AI agents (e.g., for chemistry, biology, or data analysis) collaborate via a shared knowledge graph and adaptive communication protocols. Each agent is fine-tuned on domain-specific tools and data, while a meta-agent orchestrates task decomposition, assigns subtasks based on agent expertise (using reinforcement learning), and synthesizes outputs. Human experts interact through a structured interface to validate intermediate results, resolve conflicts, and guide exploration. The system will be tested on interdisciplinary challenges like drug discovery, where agents propose molecular designs, predict biological interactions, and optimize synthesis pathways. Expected outcomes include measurable improvements in hypothesis quality (via domain benchmarks) and efficiency (time/resources saved) compared to single-agent or static multi-agent systems. Impact: Accelerates cross-domain scientific breakthroughs while ensuring reliability through human-AI synergy.
