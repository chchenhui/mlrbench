1. **Title**: AstroAgents: A Multi-Agent AI for Hypothesis Generation from Mass Spectrometry Data (arXiv:2503.23170)
   - **Authors**: Daniel Saeedi, Denise Buckner, Jose C. Aponte, Amirali Aghazadeh
   - **Summary**: AstroAgents introduces a multi-agent AI system designed to generate hypotheses from mass spectrometry data. The system comprises eight collaborative agents, each assigned specific roles such as data analysis, planning, domain-specific exploration, literature review, and critique. Applied to astrobiology, AstroAgents demonstrated the ability to produce plausible and novel hypotheses, with 36% identified as plausible and 66% of those being novel.
