### 2. Introduction  
**Background**  
Autonomous AI systems for scientific discovery have demonstrated potential in generating hypotheses, analyzing data, and optimizing experiments. However, current approaches often rely on monolithic architectures that lack domain specialization, leading to generic or untestable hypotheses. Recent works such as *AstroAgents* (2025) and *SciAgents* (2024) highlight the value of multi-agent systems (MAS) in decomposing complex tasks, while *VirSci* (2024) emphasizes collaborative reasoning. Despite these advances, key challenges persist in agent coordination, domain adaptation, and validation of outputs.  

**Research Objectives**  
This project aims to design **DecompAI**, a multi-agent framework that decomposes hypothesis generation into modular tasks handled by specialized agents. Key objectives include:  
1. **Architectural Design**: Develop agents for domain exploration, reasoning, validation, and critique, interconnected via a dynamic knowledge graph.  
2. **Game-Theoretic Coordination**: Implement utility functions balancing collaboration and divergence to optimize hypothesis novelty and feasibility.  
3. **Domain-Specialized Fine-Tuning**: Adapt agents to scientific domains (e.g., chemistry, genetics) using task-specific corpora.  
4. **Validation and Benchmarking**: Evaluate hypothesis quality, computational efficiency, and reproducibility against state-of-the-art systems.  

**Significance**  
DecompAI addresses critical gaps in AI-driven scientific discovery by:  
- Enhancing hypothesis **specificity** through domain-adapted agents.  
- Reducing AI **hallucinations** via structured validation chains.  
- Enabling **transparent reasoning** for human-AI collaboration.  
- Serving as a template for cross-disciplinary applications in materials science, medicine, and climate modeling.

### 3. Methodology  
#### 3.1 System Architecture  
The DecompAI framework comprises four specialized agents and a centralized knowledge graph (KG):  

1. **Domain Explorer Agent (DEA)**:  
   - **Role**: Curate domain-specific knowledge from databases (e.g., PubMed, ChEMBL).  
   - **Fine-Tuning**: Pre-trained on domain corpora using masked language modeling:  
     $$\mathcal{L}_\text{MLM} = -\mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}} \log P(x_\text{masked} | x_\text{context})$$  

2. **Inferential Reasoner Agent (IRA)**:  
   - **Role**: Generate candidate hypotheses using abductive reasoning.  
   - **Mechanism**: Combines KG embeddings with logical constraints:  
     $$h_c = \text{argmax}_h \, P(h | \text{KG}, \mathcal{R}) \quad \text{where } \mathcal{R} \text{ is a set of domain rules}.$$  

3. **Validation Agent (VA)**:  
   - **Role**: Predict experimental feasibility using physics-informed models (e.g., quantum chemistry simulations).  
   - **Validation Loss**:  
     $$\mathcal{L}_\text{val} = \sum_{h} \| f_\text{sim}(h) - f_\text{real}(h) \|^2$$  

4. **Critic Agent (CA)**:  
   - **Role**: Refine hypotheses via adversarial evaluation and error correction.  

**Dynamic Knowledge Graph**:  
A graph $\mathcal{G} = (V, E)$ stores entities (e.g., chemical compounds) and relationships (e.g., reaction pathways). Agents update $\mathcal{G}$ via graph neural networks (GNNs):  
$$ \mathbf{h}_v^{(t+1)} = \text{GNN}\left(\mathbf{h}_v^{(t)}, \{\mathbf{h}_u^{(t)}\}_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)}\right) $$  

#### 3.2 Algorithmic Components  
**Game-Theoretic Utility Functions**  
Each agent $i$ optimizes a utility function balancing **cooperation** ($C_i$) and **divergence** ($D_i$):  
$$
U_i(s) = \lambda \cdot \underbrace{\sum_{j \neq i} \text{KL}\left(P_i(s) \| P_j(s)\right)}_{C_i} + (1-\lambda) \cdot \underbrace{\mathbb{E}[ \text{Novelty}(s) ]}_{D_i},
$$  
where $\lambda$ controls exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Agents perform trust region optimization (MATRL, 2021) to ensure monotonic improvement:  
$$
\max_{\theta_i} \mathbb{E}[U_i(s)] \quad \text{s.t. } D_\text{KL}(\pi_{\text{old}} \| \pi_{\text{new}}) \leq \delta.
$$  

**Validation Chains**  
Hypotheses undergo iterative refinement:  
1. DEA retrieves relevant literature and data.  
2. IRA generates hypotheses using transformer-based logical sampling.  
3. VA simulates feasibility using domain-specific tools (e.g., DFT calculations).  
4. CA critiques outputs via pairwise comparison:  
   $$ \text{Preference}(h_1, h_2) = \sigma\left(\beta \cdot (s(h_1) - s(h_2))\right), $$  
   where $s(h)$ is a viability score.  

#### 3.3 Experimental Design  
**Datasets & Baselines**  
- **Benchmarks**:  
  - *Chemical Synthesis Prediction*: USPTO datasets for reaction outcomes.  
  - *Genetic Pathway Discovery*: KEGG pathways with CRISPR perturbation data.  
- **Baselines**: AstroAgents, VirSci, GPT-4 with Chain-of-Thought prompting.  

**Evaluation Metrics**  
1. **Hypothesis Novelty**: Citation-based metric measuring divergence from prior literature.  
2. **Scientific Validity**: Expert ratings (1–5 scale) on testability and coherence.  
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Wall-clock time and compute costs for hypothesis resolution.  
4. **Hallucination Rate**: Percentage of hypotheses invalidated by domain experts.  

**Statistical Analysis**  
Performance differences will be tested for significance using paired $t$-tests ($\alpha=0.05$). Ablation studies will assess contributions of individual agents.

### 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. A 25–40% improvement in hypothesis novelty over AstroAgents and VirSci across chemistry and genetics benchmarks.  
2. A 30% reduction in hallucination rates via iterative validation chains.  
3. Human-AI collaboration protocols enabling rapid hypothesis refinement (≤2 iterations).  

**Impact**  
- **Accelerated Discovery**: Reduced turnaround time for generating testable hypotheses in high-throughput experimentation.  
- **Generalizable Framework**: Extensible to materials design, drug discovery, and climate science.  
- **Ethical AI**: Transparent reasoning chains and human oversight mitigate risks of biased or unsafe proposals.

**Conclusion**  
DecompAI bridges the gap between autonomous AI systems and rigorous scientific methodology by integrating domain-specialized agents, theoretical guarantees, and human-centered design. By addressing critical challenges in coordination, validation, and reproducibility, this framework has the potential to redefine AI’s role in accelerating scientific breakthroughs.
