1. Title  
DecompAI: A Multi-Agent Decomposition Framework for Automated Scientific Hypothesis Generation  

2. Introduction  

Background  
The pace of scientific discovery is increasingly driven by data-intensive methods and complex cross-disciplinary insights. State-of-the-art AI systems—often monolithic large language models (LLMs) or foundation models—can generate hypotheses, but they tend to produce unfocused, generic, or unverifiable suggestions due to their single-agent architectures and lack of explicit domain specialization. Recent multi-agent frameworks such as AstroAgents, VirSci, and SciAgents have demonstrated that collaborating specialized agents can yield more plausible and novel hypotheses by distributing tasks like literature review, domain exploration, and critique. However, these systems typically lack a unified mechanism for balancing cooperation and divergence among agents, suffer from hallucination, and provide limited transparency into their reasoning chains.

Research Objectives  
This proposal presents DecompAI, a modular multi-agent framework designed to automate the full pipeline of hypothesis generation, from domain exploration to experimental validation, while maintaining transparency, controllability, and human-in-the-loop oversight. Our specific objectives are:  
•  To design a set of specialized agents—Domain Explorer, Knowledge Retriever, Reasoning Engine, and Experimental Validator—that communicate via a dynamic knowledge graph.  
•  To develop game-theoretic utility functions and trust-region optimization methods that balance cooperative information sharing and divergent exploration across agents.  
•  To fine-tune each agent on domain-specific corpora (e.g., chemical synthesis and genetic pathway literature) to increase relevance and reduce hallucination.  
•  To integrate human feedback at key junctures, ensuring ethical standards, accountability, and interpretability.  
•  To evaluate DecompAI on chemical synthesis and genetic pathway discovery benchmarks, measuring hypothesis novelty, scientific validity, resource efficiency, and transparency.

Significance  
By decomposing the hypothesis generation task into specialized agents with explicit coordination mechanisms, DecompAI aims to:  
1. Improve the relevance and novelty of generated hypotheses.  
2. Quantify and minimize experimental resource costs.  
3. Provide transparent, inspectable reasoning chains.  
4. Enable rapid, reliable human-AI collaboration in scientific discovery.  

If successful, DecompAI will offer a blueprint for truly agentic AI in science, transforming how researchers formulate, test, and validate new ideas.

3. Methodology  

3.1 System Architecture  
DecompAI consists of five core components:  
•  Dynamic Knowledge Graph (DKG): A shared data structure $G=(V,E)$ capturing entities (e.g., molecules, genes, reactions) and relations (e.g., “activates,” “catalyzes”). Agents read from and write to $G$ in real time.  
•  Domain Explorer Agent ($A_{\text{DE}}$): Proposes candidate concepts or uncharted subdomains by sampling the hypothesis space.  
•  Knowledge Retriever Agent ($A_{\text{KR}}$): Enriches $G$ via retrieval-augmented generation from domain-specific databases (e.g., PubChem, ChEMBL, KEGG, Reactome).  
•  Reasoning Engine Agent ($A_{\text{RE}}$): Synthesizes new hypotheses via inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning over $G$, leveraging LLM chain-of-thought and symbolic reasoning methods.  
•  Experimental Validator Agent ($A_{\text{EV}}$): Simulates resource costs and feasibility, filtering out impractical or overly expensive hypotheses.  
•  Orchestrator: Coordinates agent actions, resolves conflicts, and aggregates proposals for human review.

3.2 Dynamic Knowledge Graph  
We represent the combined scientific knowledge as a labeled graph  
$$G = (V, E, \tau_V, \tau_E)$$  
where $V$ is the set of nodes, $E \subseteq V\times V$ the set of edges, and $\tau_V$, $\tau_E$ type-labeling functions for nodes and edges. At time step $t$, each agent $A_i$ examines a local view $G_t^i\subseteq G_t$ and issues read/write operations:  
•  Node addition: $V_{t+1} \leftarrow V_t \cup \{v_{\text{new}}\}$  
•  Edge addition: $E_{t+1} \leftarrow E_t \cup \{(v_p, v_q)\}$  

Updates are serialized by the Orchestrator to ensure consistency and prevent race conditions.

3.3 Agent Design  

3.3.1 Domain Explorer Agent ($A_{\text{DE}}$)  
•  Input: Current graph $G_t$ and list of unexplored domain regions.  
•  Model: LLM fine-tuned on domain corpora to predict promising concept expansions.  
•  Output: New candidate node proposals $\{v_i\}$ with scores $\sigma_{\text{DE}}(v_i)$.  
•  Formula:  
$$\sigma_{\text{DE}}(v) = \lambda_1 \operatorname{Uncertainty}(v) + \lambda_2 \operatorname{Novelty}(v)$$  
where Uncertainty is the predictive entropy of the LLM and Novelty is the graph-distance from existing nodes.

3.3.2 Knowledge Retriever Agent ($A_{\text{KR}}$)  
•  Input: Node proposals from $A_{\text{DE}}$.  
•  Process: Uses a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline. For each new node $v$, retrieve top-$k$ relevant documents via a vector database ($\text{FAISS}$), then extract entities and relations using named-entity recognition and relation-extraction models.  
•  Output: Expanded subgraph $\Delta G_{\text{KR}}$ with confidence scores $\sigma_{\text{KR}}$ for each edge/node.  

3.3.3 Reasoning Engine Agent ($A_{\text{RE}}$)  
•  Input: Updated graph $G_t \cup \Delta G_{\text{KR}}$.  
•  Process: Combines symbolic reasoning over $G$ with LLM chain-of-thought to propose hypotheses $H = \{h_j\}$. Hypotheses are represented as subgraphs $h_j \subseteq G$.  
•  Scoring: Each hypothesis $h$ is scored by a hybrid function:  
$$S_{\text{RE}}(h) = \alpha\,\operatorname{LogicalCoherence}(h) + \beta\,\operatorname{LLMConfidence}(h)$$  
where LogicalCoherence is derived from path-consistency checks in $G$.

3.3.4 Experimental Validator Agent ($A_{\text{EV}}$)  
•  Input: Candidate hypotheses $\{h_j\}$.  
•  Process: Estimates resource cost $C(h)$ using a domain-specific cost model. For chemistry:  
$$C(h) = \sum_{r\in h} c_r \cdot n_r$$  
where $c_r$ is the unit cost of reagent or procedure $r$ and $n_r$ its stoichiometric coefficient. For genetics: cost is computed from sequencing, reagents, and labor time.  
•  Output: Filtered hypotheses with feasibility flag $f(h)\in\{0,1\}$ and efficiency score $\eta(h)=1/C(h)$.

3.4 Agent Coordination via Game-Theoretic Utility  
To balance cooperation and divergence, each agent $A_i$ maximizes a utility  
$$U_i = \alpha_i\,\text{Novelty}(a_i) + \beta_i\,\text{Relevance}(a_i) - \gamma_i\,\text{Cost}(a_i) + \delta_i\,\sum_{j\neq i}\kappa_{ij}\,\text{Divergence}_{ij}(a_i,a_j)\,. $$  
Here:  
•  $\text{Novelty}(a_i)$ measures how different agent $i$’s output is from prior graph content.  
•  $\text{Relevance}(a_i)$ is a semantic similarity to the research goals.  
•  $\text{Cost}(a_i)$ approximates computational or experimental expense.  
•  $\text{Divergence}_{ij}$ penalizes overly redundant proposals between agents.  
Coefficients $(\alpha_i,\beta_i,\gamma_i,\delta_i)$ are tuned by trust-region optimization methods (e.g., Multi-Agent Trust Region Learning (MATRL)), guaranteeing monotonic improvements in a global welfare objective  
$$W = \sum_i U_i\,. $$

3.5 Human-in-the-Loop Integration  
At each major iteration, the Orchestrator presents the top-$k$ hypotheses, reasoning chains, and resource estimates to domain experts via a GUI. Experts provide feedback signals  
$$r_{\text{feedback}}\in[-1,1]$$  
which are used to fine-tune LLM parameters through reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). This loop ensures alignment with ethical guidelines and accelerates model calibration.

3.6 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
We will curate two domain-specific corpora:  
1. Chemical Synthesis Corpus: Reactions, protocols, and spectral data from Reaxys, PubChem, USPTO reaction datasets.  
2. Genetic Pathway Corpus: Pathway annotations and literature from KEGG, Reactome, and PubMed abstracts.  
Preprocessing steps include:  
•  Tokenization and semantic normalization (e.g., SMILES for molecules).  
•  Entity linking to ontologies (ChEBI, GO terms).  
•  Construction of initial seed knowledge graph $G_0$.

3.7 Experimental Design and Evaluation  

3.7.1 Benchmarks and Baselines  
We evaluate DecompAI on two benchmark tasks:  
•  Novel Reaction Hypothesis Generation (NRHG) dataset from recent ICS challenges.  
•  Genetic Pathway Discovery (GPD) benchmark curated from KEGG test splits.  
Baselines: SciAgents, ChemCrow, Crispr-GPT.

3.7.2 Metrics  
•  Novelty Score: cosine distance in embedding space between new hypothesis and existing graph substructures.  
•  Scientific Validity: percentage of hypotheses passing expert review or simulation validation.  
•  Resource Efficiency: average cost $C(h)$ normalized by baseline cost.  
•  Hallucination Rate: fraction of ungrounded assertions flagged by $A_{\text{KR}}$ or experts.  
•  Interpretability: average length of reasoning chain and percentage of symbolic vs. LLM steps.  
•  Turnaround Time: wall-clock time per iteration.

3.7.3 Statistical Analysis  
Each experimental condition will be run for $n\ge 10$ independent seeds. We will report means, standard deviations, and conduct paired $t$-tests ($p<0.05$) against each baseline.

3.8 Implementation Details  
•  Models: GPT-4 based LLMs, fine-tuned via HuggingFace Transformers and RLHF pipelines.  
•  Multi-Agent Training: Custom PyTorch implementations of MATRL.  
•  Knowledge Graph: Neo4j with APOC procedures for graph analytics.  
•  Retrieval: FAISS vector store with Sentence-Transformer embeddings.  
•  Hardware: Multi-GPU clusters (NVIDIA A100) and CPU nodes for graph operations.

Scientific & Societal Impact  
DecompAI aims to redefine how scientific hypotheses are generated and evaluated by:  
1. Accelerating discovery cycles—reducing the time from problem formulation to testable hypothesis from weeks to hours.  
2. Democratizing AI-driven research—providing transparent, interpretable reasoning chains that scientists can inspect and extend.
