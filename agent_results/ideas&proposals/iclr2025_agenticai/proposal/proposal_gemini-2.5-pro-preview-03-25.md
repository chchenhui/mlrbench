## 1. Title: DecompAI: A Modular Multi-Agent Decomposition Framework for Domain-Specialized Automated Hypothesis Generation

## 2. Introduction

**2.1 Background**
Scientific discovery is fundamentally driven by the formulation and testing of novel hypotheses. Traditionally, this process relies heavily on human intuition, deep domain expertise, and often serendipitous insights gleaned from vast amounts of existing literature and experimental data. However, the exponential growth of scientific information across disciplines presents a significant challenge, potentially burying crucial connections and delaying breakthroughs (Bornmann & Mutz, 2015). The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems, offers a transformative opportunity to augment and accelerate this process (Agrawal et al., 2019).

Agentic AI systems, capable of autonomous goal-setting, planning, tool use, and learning, are emerging as powerful tools for scientific exploration (Xi et al., 2023). Initial efforts like ChemCrow (Bran et al., 2023) for chemistry, Crispr-GPT for genetic engineering, and SciAgents (Ghafarollahi & Buehler, 2024) for materials science demonstrate the potential of AI agents to interact with scientific tools, process complex information, and even suggest research directions. However, many current AI approaches for hypothesis generation often operate as monolithic systems. While powerful, these systems can sometimes lack the deep specialization required for nuanced scientific domains, leading to hypotheses that may be plausible but generic, lacking novelty, or difficult to experimentally validate (Saeedi et al., 2025). Furthermore, mimicking the collaborative and specialized nature of human scientific teams, where different experts contribute distinct skills and perspectives, remains a significant challenge for AI (Su et al., 2024).

The limitations of monolithic approaches motivate the need for more structured, modular, and specialized AI architectures for hypothesis generation. As highlighted in the "Agentic AI for Science" workshop description, designing effective "multi-agent decomposition" frameworks (Thrust 1) and establishing robust methods for validation and interpretation (Thrust 2 & 4) are crucial research directions. Existing work like AstroAgents (Saeedi et al., 2025) and VirSci (Su et al., 2024) explicitly leverages multi-agent architectures to emulate scientific collaboration and improve idea generation, demonstrating the promise of this approach. SciAgents (Ghafarollahi & Buehler, 2024) further emphasizes the power of combining multi-agent systems with large-scale knowledge graphs for discovery. However, challenges remain in coordinating specialized agents effectively, fine-tuning them for deep domain expertise, balancing collaborative synergy with beneficial divergence, and rigorously evaluating the generated hypotheses (Literature Review Key Challenges).

**2.2 Research Idea: DecompAI Framework**
To address these challenges, we propose **DecompAI**, a novel **Multi-Agent Decomposition Framework for Automated Hypothesis Generation**. DecompAI decomposes the complex task of hypothesis formulation into distinct sub-tasks, each managed by a specialized AI agent. These agents, fine-tuned for specific functions and scientific domains (e.g., chemistry, genetics), collaborate within a structured framework. The core components include:
*   **Specialized Agents:** Dedicated agents for distinct roles: Domain Exploration (identifying relevant areas and gaps), Knowledge Retrieval (fetching and synthesizing information from literature and databases), Inferential Reasoning (generating potential causal links or mechanisms), and Experimental Validation/Quantification (assessing feasibility, suggesting experimental designs, and estimating resource needs).
*   **Dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG):** A shared, evolving KG serves as the central hub for information exchange, representing entities, relationships, evidence, and generated hypothesis fragments. Agents read from and write to the KG, ensuring collective awareness and traceability.
*   **Game-Theoretic Coordination:** We will explore game-theoretic principles, inspired by works like MATRL (Wen et al., 2021), to model and guide agent interactions. Utility functions will be designed to encourage both cooperation (building upon shared findings) and constructive divergence (exploring alternative paths or challenging existing assumptions), aiming for a balance that fosters innovation.
*   **Domain Specialization:** Agents will be fine-tuned using domain-specific corpora (e.g., chemical literature/databases, genomics datasets) to embed deep expertise, enhancing the relevance and specificity of generated hypotheses.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop Integration:** The framework will incorporate mechanisms for human oversight, allowing domain experts to guide the process, validate intermediate steps, and assess final hypotheses, ensuring alignment with scientific rigor and ethical considerations (addressing workshop Thrust 1 & 3).

**2.3 Research Objectives**
The primary goal of this research is to design, implement, and evaluate the DecompAI framework. Specific objectives include:

1.  **Develop the Modular Multi-Agent Architecture:** Define the precise roles, capabilities, communication protocols, and interaction mechanisms for the specialized agents (Domain Explorer, Knowledge Retriever, Inferential Reasoner, Experimental Validator).
2.  **Implement the Dynamic Knowledge Graph:** Design and implement the schema and functionalities of the shared KG for storing and updating scientific entities, relationships, evidence trails, and hypothesis components.
3.  **Integrate Game-Theoretic Coordination:** Formulate and implement utility functions and coordination mechanisms based on game theory to manage agent interactions, balancing cooperative synthesis and divergent exploration.
4.  **Develop Domain-Specific Agent Fine-Tuning Protocols:** Create and evaluate methodologies for fine-tuning base LLMs or foundation models for the specialized agent roles within specific scientific domains (initially focusing on chemical synthesis and genetic pathway discovery).
5.  **Evaluate DecompAI Performance:** Rigorously evaluate the framework's effectiveness in generating novel, scientifically valid, and testable hypotheses compared to baseline methods (monolithic LLMs, potentially simpler multi-agent systems) using quantitative metrics and expert evaluation.
6.  **Assess Transparency and Reduce Hallucination:** Analyze the framework's ability to provide traceable reasoning chains via the KG and agent interactions, and quantify its robustness against generating scientifically implausible or unsupported claims (hallucinations).

**2.4 Significance**
This research holds significant potential to advance the field of Agentic AI for Science. By successfully developing DecompAI, we expect to:

*   **Enhance Hypothesis Quality:** Improve the novelty, relevance, specificity, and testability of AI-generated scientific hypotheses compared to existing monolithic approaches.
*   **Accelerate Scientific Discovery:** Provide researchers with a powerful tool to explore complex scientific landscapes, identify promising research avenues more efficiently, and potentially uncover non-obvious connections.
*   **Increase Transparency and Trustworthiness:** Offer clearer insights into the hypothesis generation process through the decomposed agent structure and the traceable knowledge graph, addressing key challenges in AI interpretability (Workshop Thrust 2 & 3).
*   **Address Key Multi-Agent Challenges:** Contribute novel solutions for agent coordination, domain specialization, and balancing cooperation/divergence in scientific AI systems (Workshop Thrust 1 & 4, Literature Review Challenges).
*   **Provide a Flexible Framework:** Create a modular framework adaptable to various scientific domains beyond the initial test cases, promoting broader application of agentic AI in science (Workshop Thrust 3).
*   **Foster Human-AI Collaboration:** Develop a system designed for effective human oversight and interaction, enabling synergistic partnerships between AI and domain experts (Workshop Thrust 1).

This work directly addresses multiple workshop thrusts, including the design of agentic systems (Thrust 1), incorporating theoretical foundations like game theory (Thrust 2), practical application and domain adaptation (Thrust 3), and tackling open challenges in multi-agent collaboration and validation (Thrust 4).

## 3. Methodology

**3.1 Conceptual Framework**
DecompAI operates as a collaborative multi-agent system orchestrated around a dynamic knowledge graph (KG). The workflow for generating a hypothesis typically proceeds as follows:

1.  **Initialization:** A research question or area of interest is provided (potentially by a human user).
2.  **Domain Exploration:** The *Domain Explorer* agent analyzes the input, identifies key concepts, queries the KG for related existing knowledge, and searches external literature (e.g., PubMed, arXiv) to map the domain landscape and identify potential knowledge gaps or inconsistencies. It populates the KG with relevant context.
3.  **Knowledge Retrieval:** Based on identified gaps or promising directions, the *Knowledge Retriever* agent performs targeted searches in specialized databases (e.g., Reaxys for chemistry, STRING/BioGRID for genetics) and literature, extracting structured information (e.g., entities, relationships, experimental evidence) and integrating it into the KG.
4.  **Inferential Reasoning:** The *Inferential Reasoner* agent analyzes the enriched KG, looking for patterns, potential causal links, analogies, or contradictions. It leverages its fine-tuned reasoning capabilities (potentially incorporating logical, statistical, or causal inference models) to propose hypothesis fragments or preliminary connections. These are added to the KG with associated confidence scores and supporting evidence links.
5.  **Hypothesis Assembly & Refinement:** Agents iteratively refine and assemble hypothesis fragments from the KG. The game-theoretic coordination mechanism guides this process, potentially involving critique cycles where one agent proposes a link and another evaluates or challenges it based on feasibility or existing evidence.
6.  **Experimental Validation & Quantification:** The *Experimental Validator* agent assesses the formulated hypotheses for plausibility, novelty (comparing against KG and retrieved literature), and testability. It proposes potential experimental designs, identifies necessary resources (reagents, datasets, computational power), and estimates feasibility, adding this crucial information to the hypothesis representation in the KG.
7.  **Output & Human Interaction:** The framework presents well-formed, validated hypotheses, along with their supporting evidence trails, confidence scores, and feasibility assessments, to a human expert for review, feedback, or modification. Human feedback can refine agent priorities or constraints for subsequent iterations.

**3.2 Agent Design and Implementation**
*   **Base Models:** We will leverage state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3, Llama 3, or domain-specific models like BioBERT/ChemBERT where appropriate) as the core intelligence for each agent.
*   **Specialization:** Each agent's role will be defined through carefully crafted system prompts and fine-tuning.
    *   **Fine-tuning Data:** Domain-specific corpora will be curated. For chemistry: patent databases (USPTO), reaction databases (Reaxys excerpts), chemical literature (e.g., ACS journals). For genetics: pathway databases (KEGG, Reactome), gene interaction databases (STRING, BioGRID), biomedical literature (PubMed Central).
    *   **Fine-tuning Strategy:** We will employ techniques like instruction fine-tuning or parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods (e.g., LoRA) to adapt the base models to their specific roles (retrieval, reasoning, validation) and domains, aiming to enhance expertise without catastrophic forgetting.
*   **Tool Use:** Agents will be equipped with tools to interact with external resources: APIs for accessing scientific databases (PubMed, PubChem, UniProt, domain-specific DBs), code execution environments (for data analysis, simulations, or calculations), and search engines.
*   **Implementation Framework:** Frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, or CrewAI will be considered for managing agent interactions, communication, and tool integration.

**3.3 Knowledge Representation: Dynamic Knowledge Graph**
*   **Technology:** A graph database (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB) will be used to implement the dynamic KG.
*   **Schema:** The KG schema will represent scientific entities (genes, proteins, chemicals, reactions, diseases, concepts), relationships (interacts-with, causes, inhibits, synthesizes, part-of), evidence fragments (linking relationships to source documents or experiments), hypothesis components (premises, conclusions, supporting links), confidence scores, and novelty assessments.
*   **Interaction:** Agents will use structured queries (e.g., Cypher for Neo4j) and API calls to read from and write to the KG. Updates will be timestamped and attributed to the originating agent, enabling traceability. The KG serves as the shared memory and reasoning substrate.

**3.4 Coordination: Game-Theoretic Approach**
Inspired by multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game theory (Wen et al., 2021), we will design a coordination mechanism where agents' actions (e.g., proposing a hypothesis fragment, retrieving specific data, critiquing a proposal) are guided by utility functions.
*   **Utility Function Design:** Each agent $i$ aims to maximize its utility $U_i$. A potential formulation could be:
    $$ U_i(s, a_i, A_{-i}) = w_{coop} R_{coop}(s, a_i) + w_{div} R_{div}(a_i, A_{-i}(s)) + w_{task} R_{task}(s, a_i) - C(a_i) $$
    Where:
    *   $s$ is the current state (represented primarily by the KG).
    *   $a_i$ is the action taken by agent $i$.
    *   $A_{-i}(s)$ represents the recent actions or proposals of other agents relevant in state $s$.
    *   $R_{coop}(s, a_i)$ is a reward for contributing positively to a shared hypothesis goal (e.g., adding consistent evidence, refining a promising fragment proposed by another agent).
    *   $R_{div}(a_i, A_{-i}(s))$ is a reward for introducing novel concepts or challenging existing proposals constructively (e.g., identifying conflicting evidence, suggesting an alternative mechanism). This encourages exploration beyond consensus.
    *   $R_{task}(s, a_i)$ is a reward for successfully completing the agent's specific role-based task (e.g., retrieving relevant documents, performing a valid inference step).
    *   $C(a_i)$ represents the cost of the action (e.g., computational resources, API calls).
    *   $w_{coop}, w_{div}, w_{task}$ are weights balancing cooperation, divergence, and task completion, potentially adaptable based on the stage of hypothesis generation or human guidance.
*   **Mechanism:** We might employ a token-based system or a reputation mechanism influenced by the utility scores to prioritize agent actions or contributions within the shared environment.

**3.5 Experimental Design**
*   **Domains:**
    1.  **Chemical Synthesis Pathway Prediction:** Task: Given a target molecule, propose novel and feasible synthesis pathways. Data: USPTO patent data, Reaxys reaction data, literature.
    2.  **Genetic Pathway Discovery:** Task: Given a biological process or phenotype, identify potential underlying genetic pathways or regulatory networks. Data: STRING, BioGRID, KEGG, Reactome, PubMed abstracts.
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **Monolithic LLM:** A state-of-the-art general-purpose LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3) prompted directly with the research question.
    2.  **Fine-tuned Monolithic LLM:** The same LLM fine-tuned on the domain-specific corpus but without the multi-agent structure.
    3.  **Simplified Multi-Agent System:** A basic multi-agent setup without the game-theoretic coordination or distinct fine-tuning for roles (e.g., using a simple round-robin or blackboard approach).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Hypothesis Quality:**
        *   *Novelty:* Assessed computationally (e.g., semantic distance from known pathways/reactions in databases and literature) and by human domain experts.
        *   *Scientific Validity/Plausibility:* Rated by human domain experts (score 1-5). Automated checks against known scientific constraints (e.g., chemical reaction rules, biological pathway databases).
        *   *Testability/Feasibility:* Assessed by the Experimental Validator agent's output (resource estimation, proposed experiment clarity) and rated by human experts.
    *   **System Performance:**
        *   *Efficiency:* Time and computational resources (e.g., LLM tokens, API calls) required to generate a set of hypotheses.
        *   *Coverage:* Ability to explore different facets of a problem space.
    *   **Robustness & Transparency:**
        *   *Hallucination Rate:* Percentage of generated hypothesis components contradicted by established knowledge (checked against KG and external databases). Measured via automated checks and expert review.
        *   *Traceability Score:* Qualitative assessment of the clarity and completeness of the reasoning chain provided through agent logs and KG trails.
*   **Human Evaluation Protocol:** We will recruit domain experts (chemists, geneticists) unfamiliar with the specific generated hypotheses. They will be presented with anonymized hypotheses from DecompAI and baseline methods, evaluating them based on novelty, validity, potential impact, and testability using a standardized rubric. Inter-rater reliability will be assessed.
