# DecompAI: A Multi-Agent Decomposition Framework for Automated Scientific Hypothesis Generation and Validation

## 1. Introduction

Scientific discovery has traditionally been a human-driven endeavor, relying on researchers' expertise, intuition, and creativity to formulate hypotheses and design experiments. However, the exponential growth in scientific literature, data, and methodological complexity has created an environment where fully leveraging available information exceeds human cognitive capabilities. Artificial intelligence, particularly in the form of agentic systems, presents a transformative opportunity to augment and accelerate the scientific discovery process.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have demonstrated promising capabilities for scientific applications. Systems like AstroAgents (Saeedi et al., 2025), VirSci (Su et al., 2024), and SciAgents (Ghafarollahi & Buehler, 2024) have shown that AI can generate plausible scientific hypotheses across domains. However, these systems often suffer from several limitations that hamper their effectiveness in real scientific settings: they tend to produce unfocused or generic hypotheses, lack domain specialization, struggle with experimental validation planning, and exhibit reasoning that lacks transparency.

The core challenge lies in the inherent complexity of scientific discovery, which encompasses multiple cognitive processes: domain exploration, knowledge retrieval, inferential reasoning, experimental design, and validation. Current monolithic AI architectures attempt to handle all these tasks simultaneously, leading to suboptimal performance across the board.

In this research, we propose DecompAI, a novel multi-agent decomposition framework designed to address these limitations by segmenting the hypothesis generation and validation process into specialized components. By decomposing this complex cognitive task into targeted, domain-specialized agents that collaborate through a dynamic knowledge graph and game-theoretic coordination mechanisms, we aim to significantly improve the quality, testability, and novelty of AI-generated scientific hypotheses.

The research objectives of DecompAI are:

1. To develop a modular multi-agent system architecture where specialized agents handle distinct aspects of scientific hypothesis generation and validation.
2. To establish effective mechanisms for inter-agent communication and knowledge sharing via a dynamic knowledge graph.
3. To implement game-theoretic coordination strategies that balance cooperation and creative divergence.
4. To fine-tune agents on domain-specific scientific corpora to enhance specialized expertise.
5. To validate the system across multiple scientific domains, evaluating hypothesis quality, novelty, testability, and alignment with established scientific knowledge.

The significance of this research extends beyond incremental improvements in AI-driven science. By addressing fundamental limitations in current approaches, DecompAI could substantially accelerate scientific discovery across domains, from drug discovery to materials science to climate research. The transparent, decomposed nature of the system also enhances interpretability and human-AI collaboration, enabling researchers to better understand the reasoning behind generated hypotheses and providing natural intervention points for human guidance.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 System Architecture

DecompAI employs a modular multi-agent architecture where each agent specializes in a specific cognitive function essential to scientific hypothesis generation and validation. The system consists of five core agent types:

1. **Explorer Agent**: Identifies research gaps and potential areas for investigation in a given domain.
2. **Knowledge Agent**: Retrieves and synthesizes relevant information from scientific literature and databases.
3. **Reasoning Agent**: Generates logical inferences and causal relationships between concepts.
4. **Experiment Agent**: Designs validation experiments and predicts outcomes.
5. **Critic Agent**: Evaluates hypotheses for novelty, scientific validity, and testability.

These agents interact through a central coordination module and a shared dynamic knowledge graph (DKG). Figure 1 illustrates the system architecture.

### 2.2 Agent Specialization and Training

Each agent will be initialized from a foundation model (e.g., a large language model like GPT-4 or LLAMA-3) and then fine-tuned using domain-specific scientific corpora. The fine-tuning process will include:

1. **Corpus Preparation**: For each scientific domain (e.g., chemistry, genetics), we will compile a corpus consisting of:
   - Peer-reviewed publications from top journals in the field
   - Textbooks and reference materials
   - Existing hypothesis-experiment pairs
   - Domain-specific terminology and ontologies

2. **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Each agent will undergo supervised fine-tuning using the domain corpus, with training objectives tailored to their specific role:
   - Explorer Agents: Trained to identify research gaps and opportunities
   - Knowledge Agents: Trained for factual recall and synthesis
   - Reasoning Agents: Trained on logical inference and causal reasoning
   - Experiment Agents: Trained on experimental design and validation
   - Critic Agents: Trained to evaluate scientific validity and novelty

3. **Role-Specific Instruction Tuning**: Agents will further undergo instruction tuning using carefully crafted prompts that guide them toward their specialized functions.

The fine-tuning process can be formalized as minimizing the following loss function for each agent $i$:

$$\mathcal{L}_i = \alpha_i \mathcal{L}_{\text{base}} + \beta_i \mathcal{L}_{\text{domain}} + \gamma_i \mathcal{L}_{\text{role}}$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{base}}$ is the base language modeling loss, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{domain}}$ is the domain-specific knowledge loss, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{role}}$ is the role-specific functional loss, and $\alpha_i, \beta_i, \gamma_i$ are weighting hyperparameters specific to each agent type.

### 2.3 Dynamic Knowledge Graph

The Dynamic Knowledge Graph (DKG) serves as the central repository of information and the medium through which agents communicate. The DKG is represented as:

$$G = (V, E, A)$$

where:
- $V$ is the set of vertices (concepts, entities)
- $E$ is the set of edges (relationships between concepts)
- $A$ is a set of attributes that can be attached to vertices or edges

The DKG is initialized with domain-specific knowledge and continuously updated throughout the hypothesis generation process. Each agent can:

1. Query the DKG for relevant information
2. Add new nodes or edges based on retrieved knowledge or inferences
3. Update node and edge attributes based on new findings
4. Annotate the graph with confidence scores and uncertainty estimates

The DKG employs a versioning system to track changes, allowing for rollback and branching exploration of different hypothesis paths.

### 2.4 Game-Theoretic Coordination

To balance cooperation and creative divergence among agents, we implement a game-theoretic coordination mechanism inspired by Multi-Agent Trust Region Learning (Wen et al., 2021). Each agent $i$ has a utility function $U_i$ that guides its decision-making:

$$U_i = \omega_1 U_{\text{individual}} + \omega_2 U_{\text{collective}} + \omega_3 U_{\text{divergence}}$$

where:
- $U_{\text{individual}}$ represents the agent's success in fulfilling its specialized role
- $U_{\text{collective}}$ represents the overall quality of the generated hypothesis
- $U_{\text{divergence}}$ represents the novelty and uniqueness of the agent's contribution
- $\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3$ are weighting parameters that can be adjusted to promote different system behaviors

The coordination mechanism optimizes a joint policy $\pi = (\pi_1, \pi_2, ..., \pi_n)$ where each $\pi_i$ is an agent's policy, using trust region optimization:

$$\max_{\pi} \sum_{i=1}^{n} U_i(\pi)$$

subject to:
$$D_{KL}(\pi_i || \pi_i^{\text{old}}) \leq \delta_i \quad \forall i \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}$$

where $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence and $\delta_i$ is the trust region parameter that limits how much each agent's policy can change in a single update step.

### 2.5 Hypothesis Generation and Validation Pipeline

The hypothesis generation process follows a structured pipeline:

1. **Exploration Phase**: The Explorer Agent identifies a potential research gap or question within the domain.

2. **Knowledge Assembly Phase**: The Knowledge Agent retrieves relevant information from the literature and updates the DKG with this information.

3. **Reasoning Phase**: The Reasoning Agent analyzes the knowledge graph, identifies potential causal relationships, and formulates preliminary hypotheses using abductive reasoning.

4. **Experimental Design Phase**: The Experiment Agent designs validation experiments for each hypothesis, estimating required resources, expected outcomes, and potential confounding factors.

5. **Critique Phase**: The Critic Agent evaluates the hypothesis-experiment pairs for scientific validity, novelty, and feasibility.

6. **Refinement Phase**: Based on the critique, agents collaboratively refine the hypothesis and experimental design through multiple iterations.

7. **Final Hypothesis Generation**: The system outputs the refined hypothesis, supporting evidence, proposed experimental validation, and confidence assessment.

### 2.6 Experimental Design and Evaluation

We will evaluate DecompAI across two scientific domains with readily available benchmarks:

1. **Chemical Synthesis Domain**: Focused on predicting novel synthetic pathways for target compounds.
2. **Genetic Pathway Discovery Domain**: Focused on identifying gene interactions and regulatory mechanisms.

For each domain, we will assess performance using the following metrics:

1. **Hypothesis Quality**:
   - Novelty: Measured by comparing generated hypotheses against existing literature
   - Scientific Validity: Evaluated by domain experts on a 1-5 scale
   - Testability: Assessed based on the concreteness and feasibility of validation experiments

2. **System Performance**:
   - Time Efficiency: Time required to generate hypotheses
   - Resource Efficiency: Computational resources required
   - Knowledge Utilization: Effective incorporation of relevant literature

3. **Comparative Evaluation**:
   - Against baseline monolithic systems
   - Against existing multi-agent approaches (AstroAgents, VirSci, SciAgents)
   - Against human expert performance (where feasible)

The evaluation process will involve:

1. **Benchmark Dataset Construction**: We will compile a test set of 50 research problems per domain, with known outcomes for validation.

2. **Blind Expert Evaluation**: Domain experts will evaluate generated hypotheses in a blinded fashion, without knowing whether they were produced by AI or humans.

3. **Experimental Validation**: For a subset of generated hypotheses, we will conduct actual laboratory experiments to validate predictions.

4. **Ablation Studies**: We will conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each system component:
   - Multi-agent decomposition vs. monolithic approach
   - Game-theoretic coordination vs. fixed roles
   - Domain-specific fine-tuning vs. generic models
   - Dynamic knowledge graph vs. static knowledge representation

### 2.7 Human-AI Collaboration Interface

DecompAI will include a dedicated interface for human-AI collaboration, allowing researchers to:

1. Guide the exploration process
2. Provide feedback on generated hypotheses
3. Inject domain expertise at any stage
4. Visualize the knowledge graph and reasoning chains
5. Adjust the system's creativity-validity tradeoff

The interface will record all human interventions, enabling analysis of how human guidance affects hypothesis quality and system performance.

5. **New Models for Human-AI Scientific Collaboration**: DecompAI establishes a framework for effective human-AI collaboration in science, potentially redefining how researchers interact with AI tools and integrating them more deeply into the scientific workflow.

The modular, transparent nature of DecompAI addresses many ethical concerns associated with AI in scientific discovery. By providing clear reasoning chains and uncertainty quantification, the system enables appropriate human oversight while still leveraging AI's computational advantages. This balanced approach ensures that AI remains a tool that augments human scientific creativity rather than replacing it, while simultaneously expanding the frontiers of what's possible in scientific discovery.

Through DecompAI, we aim to advance not just specific scientific domains but the very process of scientific discovery itself, creating a new paradigm for how hypotheses are generated, refined, and validated in the age of artificial intelligence.
