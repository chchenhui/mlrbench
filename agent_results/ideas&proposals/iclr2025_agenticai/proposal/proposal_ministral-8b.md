# DecompAI: Multi-Agent Decomposition Framework for Automated Hypothesis Generation

## 1. Introduction

### Background

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into scientific discovery has the potential to revolutionize research across various domains. However, existing AI-driven hypothesis generators often produce unfocused or generic suggestions due to monolithic architectures lacking domain specialization. This limitation hinders the relevance, testability, and novelty of proposed scientific hypotheses. To address this challenge, we propose a modular multi-agent system, DecompAI, which decomposes the hypothesis generation process into specialized agents. Each agent is responsible for a specific task, such as domain exploration, knowledge retrieval, inferential reasoning, and experimental validation. This approach aims to improve the quality of generated hypotheses by leveraging domain-specific expertise and fostering collaborative, innovative problem-solving.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. To develop a modular multi-agent system for automated hypothesis generation.
2. To fine-tune agents on domain-specific corpora to enhance expertise and relevance.
3. To employ game-theoretic utility functions to balance cooperation and divergence among agents.
4. To evaluate the framework on chemical synthesis and genetic pathway discovery benchmarks, assessing hypothesis novelty, scientific validity, and resource efficiency.

### Significance

The proposed DecompAI framework addresses several key challenges in AI-driven scientific discovery. By decomposing the hypothesis generation process into specialized agents, DecompAI improves the relevance, testability, and novelty of proposed hypotheses. The framework also promotes transparency in the reasoning process, enabling faster and more reliable scientific discovery with integrated human oversight. Furthermore, DecompAI contributes to the broader goal of developing agentic AI systems for scientific discovery, as outlined in the workshop's research thrusts.

## 2. Methodology

### Research Design

#### 2.1 Multi-Agent Framework

The DecompAI framework consists of four specialized agents: Domain Explorer, Knowledge Retriever, Inferential Reasoner, and Experimental Validator. Each agent is fine-tuned on domain-specific corpora to enhance expertise and relevance. The agents communicate and collaborate through a dynamic knowledge graph, sharing information and insights to generate novel hypotheses.

- **Domain Explorer**: This agent explores the scientific literature and domain-specific data to identify potential research areas and gaps. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text and extract relevant information.
- **Knowledge Retriever**: This agent retrieves domain-specific knowledge from databases, ontologies, and other sources. It employs information retrieval techniques to find relevant information and integrate it into the knowledge graph.
- **Inferential Reasoner**: This agent performs inferential reasoning to generate hypotheses based on the information retrieved by the Knowledge Retriever. It uses logical reasoning and probabilistic programming to draw conclusions and propose novel hypotheses.
- **Experimental Validator**: This agent evaluates the feasibility and validity of generated hypotheses through experimental design and validation. It employs statistical methods and machine learning techniques to assess the hypotheses and provide feedback to the other agents.

#### 2.2 Game-Theoretic Utility Functions

To balance cooperation and divergence among agents, DecompAI employs game-theoretic utility functions. These functions reward agents for contributing to the collective goal while also encouraging innovative and divergent thinking. The utility functions are designed to ensure that agents collaborate effectively while also exploring new ideas and hypotheses.

#### 2.3 Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning

Each agent in the DecompAI framework is fine-tuned on domain-specific corpora to enhance expertise and relevance. The fine-tuning process involves training the agents on relevant datasets and domain-specific knowledge graphs. This approach ensures that the agents possess the necessary domain knowledge to generate relevant and testable hypotheses.

#### 2.4 Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the DecompAI framework, we will use a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. The primary evaluation metrics include:
- **Hypothesis Novelty**: Measures the novelty of generated hypotheses using techniques such as topic modeling and semantic similarity.
- **Scientific Validity**: Assesses the scientific validity of generated hypotheses through expert evaluation and experimental validation.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Evaluates the efficiency of the hypothesis generation process in terms of computational resources and time.

### Experimental Design

The DecompAI framework will be evaluated on chemical synthesis and genetic pathway discovery benchmarks. These benchmarks will provide a standardized assessment of the framework's performance in generating novel, relevant, and testable hypotheses.

#### 2.5 Benchmarks

- **Chemical Synthesis**: The benchmark will involve generating hypotheses for chemical synthesis reactions. The evaluation will assess the novelty, relevance, and testability of the generated hypotheses.
- **Genetic Pathway Discovery**: The benchmark will involve generating hypotheses for genetic pathway discovery. The evaluation will assess the novelty, relevance, and testability of the generated hypotheses.

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Hypothesis Novelty**: Measured using topic modeling and semantic similarity techniques.
- **Scientific Validity**: Assessed through expert evaluation and experimental validation.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Evaluated in terms of computational resources and time.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Improved Hypothesis Quality

The DecompAI framework is expected to improve the quality of generated hypotheses by leveraging domain-specific expertise and fostering collaborative, innovative problem-solving. The modular architecture and specialized agents enable the generation of more relevant, testable, and novel hypotheses.

### Reduced Hallucination

By decomposing the hypothesis generation process into specialized agents, DecompAI reduces the risk of hallucination, where AI systems generate false or misleading information. The dynamic knowledge graph and domain-specific fine-tuning ensure that the generated hypotheses are grounded in relevant and accurate information.

### Transparent Reasoning Chains

The DecompAI framework promotes transparency in the reasoning process by providing clear and understandable chains of reasoning. The collaboration among agents and the use of game-theoretic utility functions ensure that the hypotheses are generated in a logical and coherent manner, enabling human oversight and understanding.

### Faster and More Reliable Scientific Discovery

By improving the quality of generated hypotheses and reducing the risk of hallucination, DecompAI enables faster and more reliable scientific discovery. The integrated human oversight ensures that the hypotheses are ethically sound and aligned with the goals of scientific research.

### Contribution to Agentic AI Systems

The DecompAI framework contributes to the broader goal of developing agentic AI systems for scientific discovery. By addressing key challenges in AI-driven hypothesis generation, DecompAI demonstrates the potential of multi-agent systems in enhancing scientific discovery and innovation.

## Conclusion

The DecompAI framework represents a significant advancement in AI-driven scientific discovery. By decomposing the hypothesis generation process into specialized agents, DecompAI improves the quality of generated hypotheses, reduces the risk of hallucination, and promotes transparency in the reasoning process. The framework demonstrates the potential of multi-agent systems in enhancing scientific discovery and innovation, contributing to the broader goal of developing agentic AI systems for scientific discovery.
