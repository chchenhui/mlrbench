# Socially-Aligned Intrinsic Reward Learning via Multimodal Human Feedback

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Interactive learning systems that can adapt to human feedback are becoming increasingly important in real-world applications. Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted rewards or scalar feedback, which often fail to capture the rich, implicit information that humans naturally provide during interactions. This implicit feedback, including natural language, speech, eye movements, facial expressions, and gestures, can offer a more nuanced understanding of human intent and preferences. However, leveraging this implicit feedback to enhance interactive learning algorithms presents significant challenges, particularly in rapidly changing environments and when dealing with non-stationary human preferences.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a framework that enables agents to learn intrinsic reward functions from multimodal implicit human feedback. Specifically, the research aims to:

1. **Interpret Multimodal Feedback**: Develop a model capable of accurately interpreting and encoding multimodal implicit feedback into a joint latent space.
2. **Infer Rewards from Feedback**: Use inverse reinforcement learning to infer rewards from feedback without predefined semantics.
3. **Adapt to Non-Stationary Preferences**: Employ meta-learning to adapt to non-stationary human preferences and dynamic environments.
4. **Validate and Evaluate**: Conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and evaluate its performance across various metrics.

### Significance

This research has the potential to significantly advance the field of interactive machine learning by enabling agents to better understand and respond to human intent. By reducing reliance on explicit rewards, the proposed framework can lead to more scalable, socially aware AI systems that are better equipped to assist users in real-world, socially complex settings such as healthcare, education, and robotics.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Collection

The first step in the methodology involves collecting multimodal interaction data. This data will include dialogue paired with gaze, gestures, facial expressions, and other relevant modalities. The data collection process will involve:

- **Simulated Environments**: Using virtual environments to simulate interactions between humans and agents.
- **Human Subjects**: Recruiting human participants to interact with the agents, providing implicit feedback during the interaction.
- **Data Annotation**: Annotating the collected data to ensure high-quality and accurate labeling of feedback modalities.

### 2.2 Model Architecture

The core of the proposed methodology is a transformer-based model that encodes multimodal feedback into a joint latent space. This model will consist of the following components:

- **Modal Encoders**: Separate encoders for each modality (e.g., speech, gaze, facial expressions) to convert raw data into embeddings.
- **Joint Encoder**: A transformer-based model that takes the embeddings from the modal encoders and maps them into a joint latent space.
- **Intent Predictor**: A classifier that predicts human intent based on the joint latent space representation.

The architecture can be represented as follows:

```latex
\begin{align*}
\text{Modal Embeddings} &= \text{Modal Encoders}(\text{Modal Data}) \\
\text{Joint Latent Space} &= \text{Transformer}(\text{Modal Embeddings}) \\
\text{Human Intent} &= \text{Intent Predictor}(\text{Joint Latent Space})
\end{align*}
```

### 2.3 Inverse Reinforcement Learning

Using the joint latent space representation, the framework employs inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to infer rewards from feedback. The IRL process involves:

1. **Reward Function Estimation**: Estimating the reward function $R(s, a)$ from observed human feedback.
2. **Policy Optimization**: Optimizing the agent's policy $\pi(a | s)$ to maximize the expected reward.

The IRL process can be formulated as follows:

```latex
\begin{align*}
R(s, a) &= \mathbb{E}_{\text{human feedback}}[r] \\
\pi(a | s) &= \arg\max_{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \sum_{a} \pi(a | s) R(s, a) \right]
\end{align*}
```

### 2.4 Meta-Reinforcement Learning

To adapt to non-stationary human preferences and dynamic environments, the framework incorporates meta-reinforcement learning. Meta-learning allows the agent to quickly adapt to new tasks or environments by leveraging previous learning experiences. The meta-learning process involves:

1. **Meta-Training**: Training the agent on a set of diverse tasks or environments to learn a general reward function.
2. **Meta-Testing**: Applying the learned reward function to new tasks or environments, fine-tuning the agent's policy to maximize the expected reward.

The meta-learning process can be represented as follows:

```latex
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{meta}} &= \sum_{k} \mathbb{E}_{s_k \sim \mathcal{D}_k} \left[ \sum_{a_k} \pi_k(a_k | s_k) R_k(s_k, a_k) \right] \\
\pi_k(a_k | s_k) &= \arg\max_{\pi_k} \mathcal{L}_{\text{meta}}
\end{align*}
```

### 2.5 Experimental Design

To validate the proposed framework, a series of experiments will be conducted. The experimental design will include:

- **Baseline Comparison**: Comparing the performance of the proposed framework with traditional reinforcement learning methods that rely on hand-crafted rewards.
- **Human Evaluation**: Conducting human evaluations to assess the naturalness and effectiveness of the agent's interactions.
- **Generalization Tests**: Testing the agent's ability to generalize across different tasks and environments.

The evaluation metrics will include:

- **Task Performance**: Measuring the agent's success in completing tasks or achieving specific goals.
- **Human Feedback Satisfaction**: Collecting human feedback to assess the agent's ability to understand and respond to implicit feedback.
- **Adaptation Speed**: Evaluating the agent's ability to adapt to new tasks or environments quickly.
