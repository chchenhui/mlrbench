Title  
Adaptive and Personalized UI Generation via Reinforcement Learning from User Preference Signals  

Introduction  
Background  
Modern user interfaces (UIs) are increasingly generated by data-driven and AI-based systems that leverage large language models, computer vision, and rule-based design engines. While such systems can produce functional layouts and component placements, they often lack true personalization: they do not adapt dynamically to an individual user’s evolving preferences or working style. Classical HCI research has shown that personalization can dramatically improve task efficiency, user satisfaction, and accessibility (Shneiderman 2000; Nielsen 1994). At the same time, recent advances in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and human-in-the-loop (HITL) methods demonstrate that combining implicit and explicit user signals can guide complex decision-making systems toward behaviors that align with human values and preferences (Christiano et al. 2017; OpenAI 2022).  

However, most existing UI adaptation frameworks treat learning and generation as separate problems. They pretrain a model on historic interaction logs or physiologically derived labels (Gaspar-Figueiredo 2023), then apply a static policy at runtime (Gaspar-Figueiredo et al. 2024). This approach fails to respond flexibly to new behaviors or changing preferences. Moreover, current reward models often over-rely on synthetic HCI predictions rather than real user feedback, and they lack mechanisms to balance exploration of novel designs with exploitation of learned personal preferences.  

Research Objectives  
1. Develop a unified online framework that continuously generates and adapts UI layouts based on both implicit interaction data (e.g., click paths, dwell times, error rates) and explicit user feedback signals (e.g., ratings, element annotations).  
2. Design and implement a modular preference-learning module that infers user-specific reward models combining heterogeneous signals.  
3. Integrate a generative UI model (e.g., a graph-based layout generator or sequence-to-sequence component) into a reinforcement learning loop, enabling real-time UI modifications.  
4. Propose and evaluate exploration-exploitation strategies (e.g., entropy bonuses or Thompson sampling) to discover improved layouts without degrading user experience.  
5. Validate the framework through user studies and benchmark datasets, demonstrating improvements over static or non-interactive baselines in task efficiency, subjective satisfaction, and personalization accuracy.  

Significance  
By bridging cutting-edge RLHF techniques with HCI design principles, this work will:  
• Provide the first end-to-end pipeline for adaptive UI generation that learns continuously from each individual user.  
• Yield new insights into the design of reward functions that combine implicit and explicit signals in HCI contexts.  
• Offer a practical toolkit and open dataset of user interaction traces, UI layouts, and feedback annotations for the HCI and AI communities.  

Methodology  
Overview  
Our methodology comprises three core components: (1) Data Collection and Environment Design, (2) Preference Learning and Reward Modeling, and (3) Generative RL-Based UI Adaptation. Figure 1 (conceptual) illustrates the system architecture.  

1. Data Collection and Environment Design  
1.1 Initial UI Generation  
• Pretraining Dataset: Assemble a diverse set of UI layouts from public repositories (e.g., RICO dataset, Mobile UI corpus) to train an initial generative model $G_0$.  
• Layout Representation: Encode UIs as graphs $L = (V,E)$, where nodes $v_i\in V$ represent widgets (buttons, text fields, images) with attributes (size, color, position), and edges $e_{ij}\in E$ encode spatial relations (above, below, left, right).  

1.2 User Interaction Instrumentation  
• Implicit Signals: Log the following for each generated UI $L_t$:  
  – Click stream $C = \{(v_i,t_i)\}$ (widget tapped and timestamp)  
  – Dwell time $d_i$ on each widget  
  – Error events (mis-tap counts, timeouts)  
• Explicit Feedback: After each session or key task, prompt the user to rate overall satisfaction $r_s \in [1,5]$ and to highlight problematic elements by selecting or annotating them.  

1.3 Simulation Environment  
Before large-scale user trials, we construct a simulated user model $U_\phi$ that approximates typical interaction patterns and preference drift. This simulator provides fast, scalable experimentation to tune algorithms.  

2. Preference Learning and Reward Modeling  
2.1 Feature Extraction  
From logs and annotations, extract a feature vector $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$ capturing:  
– Task completion time $\tau$  
– Total errors $e$  
– Normalized click count $|C|$  
– Average dwell vector $\bar{d}$  
– Explicit rating $r_s$  
– Frequency of problematic widget tags $p$  

2.2 Reward Function Design  
We define a composite reward  
$$
R_t = w_1\cdot f_{\text{implicit}}(x_t) + w_2\cdot f_{\text{explicit}}(r_s,p) - w_3\cdot \Delta_{\text{novel}}(L_t,L_{t-1})
$$  
where  
• $f_{\text{implicit}}(x_t) = -\alpha\,\tau - \beta\,e + \gamma\,|C|$ measures efficiency and fluency.  
• $f_{\text{explicit}}(r_s,p) = \delta\,r_s - \epsilon\,p$ penalizes flagged elements.  
• $\Delta_{\text{novel}}(L_t,L_{t-1})$ captures layout distance (e.g., graph edit distance) to discourage abrupt, disorienting changes.  
The weights $(w_i,\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,\epsilon)$ are learned through inverse reinforcement learning on a small batch of human-labeled sessions or set by cross-validation in the simulation environment.  

2.3 Personalization via Bayesian Preference Posterior  
For each user $u$, maintain a posterior distribution over reward parameters $\theta_u = (w_i,\alpha,\dots)$, updated via Bayesian inference as new sessions arrive:  
$$
p(\theta_u \mid \mathcal{D}_u) \propto p(\theta_u)\prod_{t=1}^T p(R_t \mid x_t,\theta_u)\,,
$$  
where $p(R_t \mid x_t,\theta_u)$ is assumed Gaussian with mean equal to the reward function above. This posterior guides exploration-exploitation (see Section 3.3).  

3. Generative RL-Based UI Adaptation  
3.1 State, Action, and Policy Representation  
• State $s_t$: current layout embedding $h_t = \operatorname{Enc}(L_t)$ plus user context vector $c_u$ (task type, device).  
• Action $a_t$: a discrete set of layout transformations (e.g., move widget, swap widgets, recolor, resize) or high-level macro actions (e.g., “emphasize call-to-action”). We denote the action space $\mathcal{A}$.  
• Policy $\pi_\phi(a_t\mid s_t)$: parameterized by a neural network (e.g., graph neural network for layout encoding + MLP for action logits).  

3.2 Learning Algorithm  
We adopt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with an entropy bonus to encourage exploration:  
$$
L^{\mathrm{CLIP}}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_t\Big[\min\big(r_t(\phi)\hat{A}_t,\;\text{clip}(r_t(\phi),1-\epsilon,1+\epsilon)\hat{A}_t\big)\Big] - \lambda\,H(\pi_\phi)
$$  
where  
– $r_t(\phi) = \frac{\pi_\phi(a_t\mid s_t)}{\pi_{\phi_{\text{old}}}(a_t\mid s_t)}$  
– $\hat{A}_t$ is the Generalized Advantage Estimate (GAE) computed from rewards $R_t$.  
– $H(\pi_\phi)$ is the entropy of the policy.  

3.3 Exploration-Exploitation Strategy  
At each update, we sample actions not purely greedily but according to Thompson sampling over the posterior $p(\theta_u)$ of reward parameters. This yields a randomized policy tuned to the current uncertainty in the user’s preferences. As $\mathcal{D}_u$ grows, the posterior concentrates, reducing randomness and favoring exploitation.  

3.4 Training Pipeline  
1. Pretrain $\pi_\phi$ in the simulation environment with generic user models.  
2. Deploy for real users, collecting initial $\mathcal{D}_u$ for each user.  
3. Alternate between:  
   a. Posterior update for $\theta_u$ (every $N_{\rm update}$ sessions).  
   b. Policy update via PPO with mini-batches of $(s_t,a_t,R_t)$ drawn from the user’s replay buffer.  

3.5 Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics  
We propose a two-phase study:  

Phase I (Lab Study, $n=20$ participants):  
• Within-subjects design comparing:  
  – Static baseline: UI generated once by $G_0$  
  – Adaptive RLHF system  
• Tasks: Standardized set of navigation and data-entry tasks on a web-app prototype.  
• Metrics:  
  – Objective: Task completion time $\tau$, error rate $e$, number of help requests.  
  – Subjective: SUS (System Usability Scale), NASA-TLX for cognitive load, custom satisfaction survey.  
  – Adaptation curve: Improvement in average reward $R_t$ over sessions.  

Phase II (Field Study, $n=50$, duration=2 weeks):  
• Between-subjects design with control group (static UI) and adaptive group.  
• Daily logging of interaction for two weeks.  
• Longitudinal metrics: Drop-off rate, engagement frequency, personalization accuracy (e.g., correlation between predicted and observed ratings).  

Statistical Analysis  
• Use paired t-tests (Phase I) and mixed-effects models (Phase II) to assess significance.  
• Survival analysis on drop-off rates.  
• Effect sizes (Cohen’s $d$) reported.  

Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Anticipated Results  
1. Demonstrated reduction in task completion time ($\Delta\tau<0$, $p<0.05$) and error rates compared to static UIs.  
2. Sustained improvements in subjective usability (SUS increase $>10$ points) and reduced cognitive load.  
3. A quantitative characterization of how combining implicit and explicit signals yields more accurate preference models (e.g., $R^2$ improvement in predicting ratings).  
4. A trade-off analysis showing that Thompson sampling over reward posterior outperforms naive $\epsilon$-greedy approaches in discovering user-preferred layouts.  

Broader Impact  
• HCI Research: Provides a replicable framework and open-source toolkit for future studies on adaptive interfaces, lowering barriers to entry in space where ML and HCI converge.  
• Industry Applications: Enables UI builders in domains such as e-commerce, educational technology, and accessibility tools to deliver interfaces that adapt seamlessly to individual needs, improving engagement and conversion.  
• Ethics and Fairness: By making the adaptation transparent and allowing users to highlight problematic elements, the system fosters user agency and reduces risks of opaque, biased personalization. The Bayesian posterior also gives interpretable uncertainty estimates guiding cautious adaptation.  

Dissemination and Future Directions  
We will release:  
• Code and pretrained models under an open MIT license.  
• A benchmark dataset of anonymized UI layouts, interaction logs, and feedback annotations.  
• A paper at the AI+HCI workshop with detailed ablations and a live demo.  

Future work may extend to multimodal feedback (eye-tracking, voice), group interfaces where multiple users collaborate, and cross-device adaptation scenarios.
