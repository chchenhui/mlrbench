**Title:** Intuitive User-Driven Model Correction via Natural Language Feedback  

**Motivation:** Current methods for personalizing or correcting machine learning models often require technical expertise (e.g., tuning hyperparameters or labeling data), limiting accessibility for non-experts. This creates a barrier to adapting AI systems to individual needs, particularly in HCI contexts like accessibility tools or creative assistants.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a framework where users correct model behavior through natural language feedback (e.g., "Make the chatbot less formal" or "Prioritize accessibility features"). The system leverages lightweight fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to translate user instructions into model updates. A two-stage approach is proposed: (1) a language parser extracts actionable intent from feedback (e.g., detecting desired traits or errors), and (2) a human-in-the-loop RLHF mechanism updates the model using the parsed feedback as a reward signal. This avoids requiring users to interact with model internals. Expected outcomes include a benchmark for evaluating correction efficacy and open-source tools for integrating the framework into existing systems. The impact lies in democratizing AI customization, enabling users to iteratively refine models for fairness, personal preferences, or domain-specific tasks, thereby fostering trust and broadening real-world applicability.
