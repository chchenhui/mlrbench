# Adaptive UI Generation with User Preference Learning

## Motivation
Current AI-powered UI generation systems often produce interfaces that lack personalization and fail to adapt to individual user preferences over time. This gap prevents truly intuitive human-computer interaction, as interfaces might not align with users' expectations, working styles, or accessibility needs. Additionally, most systems lack mechanisms for users to provide meaningful feedback that influences future UI generations, resulting in static solutions rather than evolving interfaces that learn from user interaction patterns.

## Main Idea
I propose a novel framework for UI generation that continuously learns from implicit and explicit user feedback. The system would initially generate interfaces based on general design principles and task requirements, then adapt through a reinforcement learning approach that incorporates user interactions as reward signals. The framework would include: (1) a preference learning module that captures user interaction patterns (time spent, navigation paths, error rates); (2) an explicit feedback mechanism allowing users to highlight problematic UI elements; and (3) a generative model that evolves UI designs based on accumulated preference data. The system would balance exploration of new design possibilities with exploitation of learned preferences, enabling personalized interfaces that adapt over time. This approach bridges machine learning capabilities with human-centered design principles, leading to more intuitive, efficient, and satisfying user experiences while providing valuable insights for UI design research.
