Title:  
Interpretable Neural Operators for Transparent Scientific Discovery in Differential Equations

1. Introduction  
Background  
Over the last decade, Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) has revolutionized the way we solve and analyze differential equations in domains ranging from climate modeling to materials science. Classical numerical solvers (e.g., finite elements, finite volumes) provide high‐fidelity solutions but are computationally expensive for high‐resolution or real‐time applications. Neural operators such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and DeepONet approximate solution maps of parametric PDEs orders of magnitude faster, enabling rapid forward and inverse analyses. However, these “black‐box” models offer little insight into the underlying physics, impeding trust and adoption in critical scientific workflows.

Motivation & Significance  
Scientific discovery demands not only accurate predictions but also transparent, interpretable explanations of model outputs. Researchers and practitioners need to:  
•	Validate that model behavior aligns with physical laws.  
•	Generate human‐readable hypotheses (e.g., symbolic forms of governing equations).  
•	Understand causal relationships between input conditions and solution features.  

Our proposal addresses these needs by integrating symbolic regression, neural operator learning, attention mechanisms, and counterfactual analysis into a unified framework. The resulting “Interpretable Neural Operator” (INO) provides both high‐performance PDE solvers and mechanistic explanations, bridging the gap between data‐driven efficiency and domain‐level interpretability.

Research Objectives  
1. Design a hybrid symbolic–neural architecture that decomposes a PDE solution map into a sparse, interpretable symbolic component and a neural residual component.  
2. Incorporate attention‐driven feature attribution to highlight spatiotemporal regions or boundary conditions most critical to model predictions.  
3. Develop a counterfactual explanation module to probe causal effects of input perturbations.  
4. Benchmark the INO framework on canonical PDEs (e.g., Burgers’, heat equation, Navier–Stokes) against state‐of‐the‐art neural operators and classical solvers, measuring both predictive accuracy and explanation quality.

2. Methodology  
Overview  
Our framework consists of three core modules (Figure 1):  
A. Symbolic Regression Module (SRM)  
B. Neural Operator with Attention (NOA)  
C. Counterfactual Explanation Engine (CEE)  

We train these modules end‐to‐end on a suite of parametric PDE datasets.  

Data Collection & Preprocessing  
•	Domains: 1D Burgers’ equation, 2D heat equation, 2D incompressible Navier–Stokes in a lid‐driven cavity.  
•	Data Generation: For each PDE, sample initial and boundary conditions from prescribed distributions (e.g., random Fourier modes, spatially varying temperature fields).  
•	Numerical Solver: Generate high‐resolution ground‐truth solutions $u(x,t;\theta)$ using spectral or finite‐difference methods.  
•	Data Splits: 70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing. Add Gaussian noise ($\sigma=1\%$) to a subset for robustness experiments.

A. Symbolic Regression Module (SRM)  
Objective: Extract a sparse, closed‐form approximation to the global PDE operator.  
1. Feature Library Construction  
   Build a feature matrix $\Phi(x,t,u,\nabla u,\ldots)\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times K}$ containing candidate terms:  
   \[
     \Phi = [\,1,\ u,\ u^2,\ \partial_x u,\ \partial_t u,\ u\,\partial_x u,\ \partial_{xx}u,\ \ldots\,].
   \]  
2. Sparse Identification (SINDy‐style)  
   Solve  
   $$
     \min_{\xi\in\mathbb{R}^K}\ \| \Phi \,\xi - \partial_t u\|_2^2 \;+\;\lambda\|\xi\|_1
   $$  
   to obtain sparse coefficients $\xi^*$. Terms with $|\xi_i^*|>\varepsilon$ define the symbolic operator  
   $$
     \mathcal{S}(u) = \sum_{i:|\xi_i^*|>\varepsilon}\xi_i^*\,\phi_i(u).
   $$  
3. Loss & Regularization  
   \[
     \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{symbolic}
       = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \bigl|\partial_t u_j - \mathcal{S}(u_j)\bigr|^2
       + \lambda\,\|\xi\|_1.
   \]

B. Neural Operator with Attention (NOA)  
Objective: Learn the residual fine‐scale corrections that the symbolic model cannot capture.  
1. Base Architecture  
   We adopt a Fourier Neural Operator backbone:  
   $$u_\mathrm{res} = \mathcal{FNO}(f;\theta_F),$$  
   where $f=(x,t,u_0,b)$ contains spatial coordinates, time, initial condition $u_0$, and boundary data $b$.  
2. Attention‐Driven Feature Attribution  
   - Insert multi‐head self‐attention layers in each Fourier block.  
   - Attention weights $\alpha_{ij}$ measure the relevance of mode $i$ to mode $j$.  
   - Regularize by entropic penalty to encourage focus on few critical modes:  
     $$
       \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{attn}
         = \sum_{h}\sum_{i,j}\alpha_{ij}^h\log\alpha_{ij}^h.
     $$  
3. Combined Prediction  
   The final solution is  
   $$
     \hat u(x,t) = \mathrm{Integrate}\bigl(\mathcal{S}(u) + u_\mathrm{res}\bigr),
   $$  
   where “Integrate” is a one‐step time integrator (e.g., RK4) or learned time propagation.  
4. Loss Function  
   \[
     \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{data}
       = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N\|\hat u_j - u_j^\mathrm{true}\|^2,
   \]  
   and the total NOA loss is  
   \[
     \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{NOA}
       = \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{data}
       + \beta\,\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{attn}
       + \gamma\,\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{physics}.
   \]  
   Here $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{physics}$ enforces residual PDE constraints:  
   $$
     \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{physics}
       = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j}\bigl\|\partial_t\hat u_j - \mathcal{S}(\hat u_j) - \mathcal{FNO}(f_j)\bigr\|^2.
   $$

C. Counterfactual Explanation Engine (CEE)  
Objective: Identify how perturbations in inputs affect outputs to reveal causal structure.  
1. Counterfactual Generation  
   For a baseline input $f_0$, define a perturbed input $f_\delta = f_0 + \delta v$ (e.g., change in boundary temperature).  
2. Sensitivity Analysis  
   Compute  
   $$
     \Delta u = \hat u(f_\delta) - \hat u(f_0),
   $$  
   and approximate directional derivatives  
   $$
     \frac{\partial \hat u}{\partial \delta} \approx \frac{\Delta u}{\delta}.
   $$  
3. Visualization & Quantification  
   – Plot sensitivity heatmaps over $(x,t)$.  
   – Compute “causal attribution scores” by integrating absolute sensitivities:  
     $$
       A(v)=\int|\partial_\delta \hat u(x,t)|\,dx\,dt.
     $$  

D. Training Procedure  
1. Pre‐train SRM via sparse regression on training set.  
2. Freeze $\mathcal{S}$ and train NOA end‐to‐end to minimize $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{NOA}$.  
3. Fine‐tune jointly $(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{FNO})$ with a small learning rate.  
4. Validate on held‐out data; early stop based on combined predictive and interpretability metrics.

Evaluation & Experimental Design  
Datasets & Baselines  
•	Datasets: Burgers’ (Re=1000), heat equation with spatially varying conductivity, 2D Navier–Stokes (Re=100).  
•	Baselines: FNO [Li et al. ’21], DeepONet [Lu et al. ’20], LNO [Cao et al. ’23], PROSE [Liu et al. ’23].  

Metrics  
1. Predictive Accuracy: $L^2$ error, relative $L^2$ norm  
   $$\mathrm{RelError} = \frac{\|u^\mathrm{pred}-u^\mathrm{true}\|_2}{\|u^\mathrm{true}\|_2}.$$  
2. Computational Efficiency: inference time per sample on GPU/CPU.  
3. Interpretability:  
   •	Sparsity level of $\xi$ (# nonzero terms).  
   •	Attention concentration: average entropy of $\alpha$.  
   •	Counterfactual fidelity: correlation between attribution scores and ground‐truth sensitivity (when available).  
   •	Expert evaluation: domain scientists rate explanations on a 5‐point Likert scale (clarity, physical plausibility).  

Ablation Studies  
•	Without symbolic module (pure NOA).  
•	Without attention penalty.  
•	Without counterfactual engine.  
•	Varying sparsity weight $\lambda$.  

Robustness Tests  
•	Add noise to inputs (up to 5%).  
•	Missing boundary data (randomly drop 10% sensors).  
•	Extrapolation to higher Reynolds numbers or unseen geometries.

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Anticipated Outcomes  
1. A unified INO framework that delivers prediction accuracy on par with black‐box neural operators while offering transparent, symbolic insights into the learned PDE operators.  
2. Quantifiable interpretability: sparse symbolic expressions, focused attention maps, and causal attributions that align with known physics.  
3. Demonstration of robustness to noise, incomplete data, and extrapolation scenarios.  
4. An open‐source library with modular implementations of SRM, NOA, and CEE, enabling easy adoption by the SciML community.

Broader Impact  
•	Accelerating Scientific Discovery: Researchers in climate science, fluid dynamics, and material design can rapidly test hypotheses and interpret model behavior, reducing reliance on expensive experiments or black‐box solvers.  
•	Trust & Adoption: By providing human‐understandable explanations, our approach fosters confidence in AI‐driven tools for high‐stakes decision‐making (e.g., extreme weather forecasting, biomedical engineering).  
•	Education & Outreach: The modular design and open‐source release will serve as a pedagogical platform for teaching interpretable machine learning in scientific domains.  
•	Future Extensions: The INO framework can be extended to inverse problems (governed equation discovery), optimization (design of experiments), and multimodal data (combining images, sensor readings, and equations).

By validating on canonical equations and engaging domain experts in evaluation, we aim to establish a new standard for transparent, trustworthy scientific machine learning.
