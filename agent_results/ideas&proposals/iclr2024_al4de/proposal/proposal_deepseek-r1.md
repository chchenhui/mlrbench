# Interpretable Neural Operators for Transparent Scientific Discovery with Differential Equations  

## 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Differential equations (DEs) are indispensable tools for modeling complex phenomena in climate science, fluid dynamics, and material design. Traditional numerical methods for solving DEs, while accurate, often struggle with high computational costs and scalability to large parameter spaces. Recent advances in neural operators, such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and DeepONets, have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in learning solution maps of DEs directly from data. However, these models are typically "black boxes," offering little insight into the physical mechanisms governing their predictions. In high-stakes scientific applications, the lack of interpretability undermines trust and hinders validation against domain knowledge.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research aims to develop **interpretable neural operators** that combine the scalability of data-driven approaches with human-understandable explanations. Specific objectives include:  
1. Design a hybrid symbolic-neural framework for solving DEs, where sparse symbolic terms capture dominant physical interactions, and neural networks model unresolved residuals.  
2. Integrate intrinsic interpretability mechanisms (e.g., attention layers) to quantify spatiotemporal feature importance.  
3. Generate counterfactual explanations to reveal causal relationships between inputs (e.g., boundary conditions) and DE solutions.  
4. Validate the method on canonical PDEs (Navier-Stokes, heat equations) and benchmark against traditional solvers and neural operators.  

**Significance**  
By prioritizing interpretability alongside accuracy, this work bridges the gap between AI-driven efficiency and scientific rigor. The proposed framework will empower domain experts to interrogate model behavior, validate hypotheses, and accelerate discoveries in fields like climate modeling, where understanding causal drivers of solutions is critical.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1. Data Collection and Preprocessing  
**Datasets**:  
- **Benchmark PDEs**: Simulate 2D Navier-Stokes equations (vortex shedding), heat equations with varying diffusivity, and Burgers’ equation using finite difference methods.  
- **Real-World Data**: Utilize climate modeling datasets (e.g., ERA5 reanalysis) and turbulent flow measurements.  
**Preprocessing**:  
- For synthetic data, generate solutions over parameterized initial/boundary conditions and random forcing terms.  
- Normalize inputs and apply random noise (up to 5% SNR) to test robustness.  

### 2.2. Algorithmic Framework  

**A. Symbolic-Neural Hybrid Model**  
The solution $u(x)$ is decomposed into a symbolic component $S(u)$ and a neural residual $R(u)$:  
$$
u(x) = \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i \phi_i(x)}_{\text{Symbolic terms}} + \underbrace{\mathcal{G}_\theta(u)(x)}_{\text{Neural operator}},
$$
where $\phi_i$ are interpretable basis functions (e.g., polynomials, trigonometric terms), and $\mathcal{G}_\theta$ is a neural operator (e.g., FNO). Sparsity is enforced via Lasso regularization on coefficients $\alpha_i$:  
$$
\min_{\theta, \alpha} \left\| u - \left( \sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i \phi_i + \mathcal{G}_\theta(u) \right) \right\|^2 + \lambda \|\alpha\|_1.
$$
**Implementation**:  
1. **Sparse Regression**: Use STLSQ (Sequential Thresholded Least Squares) to identify active terms in $\phi_i$.  
2. **Neural Operator**: Train an FNO or DeepONet to approximate residuals, initialized via transfer learning from pretrained models.  

**B. Attention-Driven Feature Attribution**  
Spatiotemporal attention weights $\alpha_{ij}$ in the neural operator are computed as:  
$$
\alpha_{ij} = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{Q(x_i) K(x_j)^T}{\sqrt{d}} \right),
$$  
where $Q$ and $K$ are query and key projections of input features. The attention map identifies regions where boundary conditions or source terms most strongly influence the solution.  

**C. Counterfactual Explanations**  
Given an input $u_0$ and solution $u = \mathcal{G}(u_0)$, generate minimal perturbations $\delta$ to $u_0$ that alter the solution $u$ by optimizing:  
$$
\delta^* = \arg \min_{\delta} \left\| \mathcal{G}(u_0 + \delta) - \mathcal{G}(u_0) \right\|^2 + \gamma \|\delta\|_2.
$$
Adjoint sensitivity analysis is used to trace gradients of the solution with respect to $\delta$.  

### 2.3. Experimental Design  

**Baselines**:  
- Traditional solvers (finite element, spectral methods).  
- Neural operators (FNO, DeepONet, LNO).  
- Symbolic regression (PySINDy).  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
- **Accuracy**: Relative $L^2$ error, runtime efficiency.  
- **Interpretability**:  
  - *Sparsity*: Number of non-zero terms in symbolic component.  
  - *Attention Consistency*: Correlation between attention weights and ground-truth PDE terms.  
  - *Expert Evaluation*: Domain scientists rate explanation plausibility on a 5-point Likert scale.  

**Ablation Studies**:  
- Vary the complexity of symbolic terms and neural operator architectures.  
- Test robustness to noisy inputs and incomplete boundary conditions.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

**Expected Outcomes**:  
1. **Accuracy-Robustness Trade-off**: The hybrid model will achieve comparable accuracy to FNOs ($<2\%$ relative $L^2$ error) while reducing parameter count by 30–50% through sparse symbolic terms.  
2. **Human-Understandable Explanations**: Attention maps will align with known physical features (e.g., vortex cores in Navier-Stokes), validated by expert evaluations.  
3. **Generalization**: The framework will maintain performance on out-of-distribution parameters (e.g., Reynolds numbers 50% higher than training data).  

**Impact**:  
- **Scientific Workflows**: Enable rapid prototyping of DE-based models with interpretable insights, reducing validation cycles in climate and engineering design.  
- **Education**: Provide tools for teaching DE solutions through interactive explanations.  
- **Ethical AI**: Reduce risks of deploying opaque AI in safety-critical applications.
