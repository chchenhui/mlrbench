Title: Locally Adaptive Neural Operator with Uncertainty-Guided Refinement

Motivation:  
Standard neural operators (e.g. FNO, DeepONet) often require uniform high-resolution grids to capture localized featuresâ€”incurring large computational costs and failing to adapt to region-specific complexities. Integrating uncertainty quantification with model adaptivity can target resolution where it matters most.

Main Idea:  
We propose a hierarchical mixture-of-experts neural operator that partitions the domain into local patches, each handled by a lightweight, specialized operator. A gating network routes input field patches to the appropriate expert. During training, an uncertainty estimator (e.g. ensemble variance or Bayesian last layer) identifies regions where prediction confidence is low. Those regions trigger the creation or refinement of local experts and finer partitioning. Training alternates between:  
1) fitting global expert assignments and local operators on coarse data;  
2) computing uncertainty maps;  
3) adaptively subdividing high-uncertainty patches and initializing new experts.  
This yields a sparse, adaptive surrogate that allocates capacity to complex regions, reducing overall parameter count. We expect order-of-magnitude speedups in simulating PDEs with sharp gradients (e.g. shocks, boundary layers) while retaining interpretability through explicit region assignments. Applications include efficient climate and fluid-dynamics modeling with built-in error indicators.
