**Literature Review: Interpretable Neural Operators for Transparent Scientific Discovery with Differential Equations**

1. **Title**: LNO: Laplace Neural Operator for Solving Differential Equations (arXiv:2303.10528)
   - **Authors**: Qianying Cao, Somdatta Goswami, George Em Karniadakis
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces the Laplace Neural Operator (LNO), which leverages the Laplace transform to decompose the input space. Unlike the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), LNO can handle non-periodic signals, account for transient responses, and exhibit exponential convergence. LNO incorporates the pole-residue relationship between the input and the output space, enabling greater interpretability and improved generalization ability.
