# Adaptive Model-Assisted Dataset Construction with Diversity-Aware Feedback Loops

## Introduction

The emergence of foundation models has demonstrated that the quality, diversity, and scale of training data are critical determinants of model performance. While significant advances have been made in model architectures, the process of dataset construction remains labor-intensive, costly, and prone to introducing biases that hinder model generalization. This is particularly problematic in emerging domains such as climate science, healthcare, and robotics, where data collection faces unique challenges and requires domain expertise.

Traditional approaches to dataset construction often prioritize scale over quality and diversity, resulting in datasets that inadequately represent the full distribution of real-world scenarios. Current model-assisted data construction methods typically focus on generating or filtering data based on simple quality metrics but fail to systematically address distributional gaps and biases. This leads to foundation models that perform well on common cases but struggle with rare events, underrepresented groups, or novel scenarios.

The research objective of this proposal is to develop an adaptive model-assisted dataset construction framework that leverages diversity-aware feedback loops to create high-quality, balanced datasets for training foundation models in emerging domains. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Design an iterative framework that continuously identifies and addresses gaps in data distribution through targeted synthetic data generation and strategic human validation.
2. Develop quantitative metrics to assess dataset diversity, quality, and representativeness across multiple dimensions.
3. Implement mechanisms to detect and mitigate bias amplification during the dataset construction process.
4. Validate the framework's effectiveness across multiple domains, demonstrating improvements in downstream model performance, particularly for underrepresented cases.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to transform how datasets are constructed for foundation models. By explicitly focusing on diversity and representativeness during the data creation process, we can address a fundamental limitation in current approaches to model training. This research could substantially reduce annotation costs while improving model robustness, fairness, and generalization capabilities. Moreover, the modular design of our proposed framework would enable adaptation to various domains, advancing ethical data practices by making bias monitoring an integral part of dataset construction.

## Methodology

Our proposed methodology consists of an iterative framework with four main components: (1) initial model training, (2) diversity-aware synthetic data generation, (3) active learning-guided human validation, and (4) continuous quality and diversity assessment. The framework operates as a closed-loop system where each iteration refines the dataset to increase diversity while maintaining quality.

### 3.1 System Architecture

The overall system architecture is illustrated in Figure 1 (not included in this proposal). The framework begins with a seed dataset that provides initial domain knowledge, then enters an iterative cycle of model training, diversity assessment, synthetic data generation, human validation, and dataset updating.

### 3.2 Initial Model Training

The first step involves training a foundation model on a seed dataset for the target domain. This model serves as both a data generator and a representation learner for diversity assessment.

Given a seed dataset $D_{\text{seed}} = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ where $x_i$ represents input features and $y_i$ represents corresponding labels or annotations, we train a foundation model $M_{\theta}$ with parameters $\theta$ to minimize a task-specific loss function:

$$\min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^n L(M_{\theta}(x_i), y_i) + R(\theta)$$

where $L$ is the loss function and $R$ is a regularization term.

The trained model provides:
1. A feature extractor that maps inputs to latent representations: $f_{\theta}: X \rightarrow Z$
2. A generator component that can synthesize new samples: $g_{\theta}: Z \rightarrow X$
3. A classifier/predictor that maps inputs to outputs: $h_{\theta}: X \rightarrow Y$

### 3.3 Diversity Assessment and Gap Identification

To identify underrepresented regions in the data distribution, we employ a combination of unsupervised and supervised techniques:

1. **Latent Space Clustering**: We map all examples in the current dataset to the latent space using $f_{\theta}$, then apply density-based clustering to identify regions of varying density:

$$Z = \{f_{\theta}(x_i) | x_i \in D_{\text{current}}\}$$
$$C = \text{DBSCAN}(Z, \epsilon, \text{min\_samples})$$

where $C$ represents the clusters and potential outliers identified by DBSCAN.

2. **Distribution Density Estimation**: We estimate the probability density function in the latent space using kernel density estimation:

$$p(z) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n K_h(z - f_{\theta}(x_i))$$

where $K_h$ is a kernel function with bandwidth $h$.

3. **Performance-based Gap Detection**: We identify data regions where the model performs poorly, indicating potential gaps:

$$\text{Error}(x) = L(M_{\theta}(x), y)$$
$$\text{GapRegions} = \{x_i | \text{Error}(x_i) > \tau\}$$

where $\tau$ is a threshold parameter.

4. **Diversity Score Calculation**: We compute a diversity score for the current dataset based on the distribution of examples in the latent space:

$$D_{\text{score}} = -\sum_{c \in C} \frac{|c|}{|D_{\text{current}}|} \log\left(\frac{|c|}{|D_{\text{current}}|}\right)$$

This entropy-based measure quantifies how evenly distributed the examples are across identified clusters.

### 3.4 Diversity-Aware Synthetic Data Generation

Based on the identified gaps, we generate synthetic data using a combination of techniques:

1. **Targeted Sampling**: We sample latent vectors $z$ from low-density regions:

$$p_{\text{sample}}(z) \propto \frac{1}{p(z) + \epsilon}$$

where $\epsilon$ is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

2. **Conditional Generation**: We generate diverse examples conditioned on underrepresented attributes or classes:

$$x_{\text{new}} = g_{\theta}(z, c)$$

where $c$ represents conditioning variables determined from diversity assessment.

3. **Data Augmentation with Controlled Variation**: For existing examples in underrepresented regions, we apply targeted augmentations:

$$x_{\text{aug}} = A(x, \delta)$$

where $A$ is an augmentation function and $\delta$ controls the strength of augmentation.

4. **Counter-bias Generation**: To counteract identified biases, we explicitly model and invert bias patterns:

$$B = \text{EstimateBias}(D_{\text{current}})$$
$$x_{\text{counter}} = g_{\theta}(z, -B)$$

### 3.5 Active Learning-Guided Human Validation

Human validation is essential to ensure the quality of synthetic data, but must be applied efficiently:

1. **Uncertainty-based Sample Selection**: We prioritize synthetic examples for human validation based on model uncertainty:

$$U(x) = -\sum_{y \in Y} P(y|x) \log P(y|x)$$

where $P(y|x)$ is the model's predicted probability distribution over outputs.

2. **Diversity-Maximizing Batch Selection**: When selecting batches for human validation, we maximize both uncertainty and diversity:

$$B^* = \arg\max_{B \subset X_{\text{synthetic}}, |B|=k} \sum_{x \in B} U(x) + \lambda \text{Diverse}(B)$$

where $\text{Diverse}(B)$ measures the diversity of batch $B$ and $\lambda$ is a weighting parameter.

3. **Structured Feedback Collection**: Human validators provide several types of feedback:
   - Quality assessment (binary accept/reject)
   - Error correction (modified labels or annotations)
   - Attribute tagging (additional metadata)
   - Bias identification (flagging potential biases)

4. **Feedback Aggregation**: Multiple validators' inputs are aggregated using:

$$q(x) = \frac{1}{V} \sum_{v=1}^V w_v q_v(x)$$

where $q_v(x)$ is validator $v$'s quality score, $w_v$ is the validator's weight, and $V$ is the number of validators.

### 3.6 Dataset Update and Evaluation

After generating and validating synthetic data, we update the dataset and evaluate its quality:

1. **Filtered Integration**: We add validated synthetic examples to the dataset:

$$D_{\text{updated}} = D_{\text{current}} \cup \{x \in X_{\text{synthetic}} | q(x) > q_{\text{min}}\}$$

2. **Distribution Balancing**: We ensure the updated dataset has improved balance across identified clusters:

$$w_c = \frac{1/|c|}{\sum_{c' \in C} 1/|c'|}$$

$$D_{\text{balanced}} = \text{Resample}(D_{\text{updated}}, w_c)$$

3. **Quality Assessment**: We evaluate the quality of the updated dataset using:
   - Cross-model consistency: Agreement between different models on predictions
   - Holdout validation: Performance on a reserved validation set
   - Out-of-distribution testing: Performance on intentionally diverse test cases

4. **Diversity Metrics**: We compute comprehensive diversity metrics including:
   - Coverage: Proportion of the latent space adequately represented
   - Evenness: How balanced the distribution is across classes/clusters
   - Distinctiveness: Average distance between examples in feature space

### 3.7 Iterative Refinement

The entire process repeats for multiple iterations, with the foundation model retrained on the updated dataset:

$$M_{\theta_{t+1}} = \text{Train}(D_{\text{updated}}, M_{\theta_t})$$

At each iteration, we evaluate stopping criteria based on:
- Convergence of diversity metrics
- Diminishing returns in model performance
- Budget constraints on human validation

### 3.8 Experimental Design

To validate our approach, we will conduct experiments across multiple domains:

1. **Domains**:
   - Climate science: Satellite imagery for extreme weather event detection
   - Biomedical imaging: Rare disease identification in medical scans
   - Robotics: Manipulation tasks in diverse environments

2. **Baselines**:
   - Random sampling from available data
   - Standard active learning without diversity awareness
   - Model-assisted curation without feedback loops
   - Human-only curation (limited scale)

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Dataset quality: Coverage, balance, and representativeness
   - Model performance: Accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC
   - Robustness: Performance under distribution shifts
   - Fairness: Equal performance across subgroups
   - Efficiency: Annotation cost reduction

4. **Experimental Protocol**:
   - For each domain, start with a small seed dataset
   - Apply our framework for 5-10 iterations
   - Train foundation models on the resulting dataset
   - Evaluate on diverse test sets, including challenging cases and distribution shifts
   - Compare against baselines in terms of model performance and data efficiency

5. **Ablation Studies**:
   - Importance of each component (diversity assessment, synthetic generation, human validation)
   - Effect of different diversity metrics
   - Impact of human validation strategies
   - Value of counter-bias generation
