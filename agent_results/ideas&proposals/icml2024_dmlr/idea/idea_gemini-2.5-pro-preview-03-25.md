**Title:** Proactive Data Drift Detection and Adaptation for Foundation Models

**Motivation:** Foundation models are often trained on vast, static datasets but deployed in dynamic environments where data distributions shift over time (dataset drift). This drift can significantly degrade model performance and reliability, especially in critical applications. Current methods often detect drift reactively; proactive strategies are needed.

**Main Idea:** We propose a framework for proactively anticipating and adapting to dataset drifts. By analyzing metadata, provenance, and temporal signals associated with incoming data streams (e.g., user interaction logs, sensor readings, timestamps), we aim to predict potential future drifts *before* they significantly impact the model. We will develop lightweight drift prediction models that run alongside the main foundation model. Upon predicting an imminent drift, the system can trigger targeted data acquisition, initiate model fine-tuning on anticipated future data distributions (potentially using synthesized data reflecting the predicted drift), or alert operators. This shifts from reactive monitoring to proactive adaptation, enhancing the robustness and long-term utility of foundation models in real-world scenarios.
