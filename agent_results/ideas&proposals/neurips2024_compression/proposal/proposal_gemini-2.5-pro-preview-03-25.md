**1. Title:** **Neural Distributed Compression of Correlated Continuous Sources via Mutual Information Regularization**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**

The relentless growth of data generated by diverse applications, from multi-sensor Internet of Things (IoT) networks and autonomous vehicle systems to large-scale scientific simulations and federated learning frameworks, necessitates highly efficient data compression techniques. When data sources are distributed and statistically correlated (e.g., multiple cameras capturing overlapping scenes, sensor arrays monitoring environmental conditions, gradients computed across distributed clients), Distributed Source Coding (DSC) offers theoretical foundations for compression gains beyond independent encoding. Classic DSC theory, primarily built upon the Slepian-Wolf theorem for lossless coding and the Wyner-Ziv theorem for lossy coding with side information, provides rate limits based on the joint and conditional entropies of the sources [Slepian & Wolf, 1973; Wyner & Ziv, 1976]. However, practical implementations based on these theorems often rely on explicit quantization and linear codes (e.g., LDPC, Turbo codes), which struggle to capture complex, non-linear, high-dimensional correlations prevalent in real-world data like images, videos, or sensor streams. Furthermore, designing optimal DSC schemes requires precise knowledge of the source statistics, which is often unavailable.

Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of deep learning, particularly neural networks, in data compression [Ball√© et al., 2017; Theis et al., 2017]. These learned compression methods, often based on autoencoder architectures, can automatically discover intricate structures and dependencies within data, achieving state-of-the-art performance for various modalities like images and videos by learning powerful non-linear transforms and entropy models. Leveraging these advancements, several works have explored neural approaches to DSC [Ozyilkan et al., 2023; Mital et al., 2022; Whang et al., 2021]. These methods typically adapt autoencoder structures for the distributed setting, often focusing on the Wyner-Ziv problem (compression with decoder-side information) or learning discrete latent representations amenable to binning strategies inspired by classical theory [Ozyilkan et al., 2023; Whang et al., 2021]. While promising, many existing neural DSC methods either inherit the need for quantization (often vector quantization [Whang et al., 2021]), focus primarily on specific scenarios like decoder-only side information [Mital et al., 2022, 2021], or lack a strong theoretical connection between the learning objective and the underlying information-theoretic limits for *continuous* source correlations exploited via continuous latent spaces.

The intersection of machine learning and information theory offers fertile ground for innovation in compression, as highlighted by the workshop theme. Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental concept quantifying the statistical dependency between random variables. Recent research has explored using MI estimation and optimization within deep learning for various purposes, including representation learning [Hjelm et al., 2019], generative modeling, and even single-source compression [Alemi et al., 2018]. Its potential for explicitly encouraging distributed encoders to learn representations that capture inter-source correlations, without resorting to potentially suboptimal quantization strategies required by classical binning, remains largely untapped for general distributed continuous source compression.

This research proposes a novel framework for distributed lossy compression of correlated *continuous* sources, moving beyond explicit quantization in the latent space. We leverage Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for each source and introduce an explicit Mutual Information (MI) regularization term into the training objective. This regularization encourages the latent representations ($Z_k$) of different sources ($X_k$) to retain maximal information about each other, thereby implicitly coordinating the encoders to exploit source correlations. This approach aims to achieve efficient compression by learning continuous, correlation-aware latent spaces, potentially offering better rate-distortion trade-offs for complex dependencies compared to methods relying solely on decoder-side correlation exploitation or discrete latent codes.

**2.2 Research Objectives**

The primary goal of this research is to develop, analyze, and validate a novel neural framework for distributed lossy compression of correlated continuous sources based on mutual information regularization. The specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop the MI-RegDSC Framework:** Design and implement a neural network architecture based on VAEs for encoding multiple correlated sources ($X_1, ..., X_K$). Formulate a joint training objective that includes:
    *   Reconstruction loss terms for each source $\hat{X}_k$.
    *   Rate constraint terms, implicitly defined by the VAE's KL divergence, controlling the information content of individual latent codes $Z_k$.
    *   A novel Mutual Information (MI) regularization term that explicitly maximizes an estimate of the MI between the latent codes ($Z_k, Z_j$) of correlated sources.
2.  **Analyze Theoretical Properties:** Investigate the theoretical underpinnings of the MI-RegDSC framework. Explore the relationship between the strength of the MI regularization ($\lambda_{MI}$) and the achievable rate-distortion performance. Qualitatively and potentially quantitatively compare the expected performance bounds with classical Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv limits, particularly focusing on scenarios with complex, non-linear correlations where classical methods might falter.
3.  **Experimentally Validate Performance:** Empirically evaluate the proposed MI-RegDSC framework on diverse datasets exhibiting spatial, temporal, or sensor-based correlations.
    *   Conduct experiments on multi-view image datasets (e.g., stereo pairs) and multi-sensor time-series data.
    *   Compare the rate-distortion performance against relevant baselines:
        *   Independent compression using similar VAE-based neural codecs.
        *   Classical DSC algorithms (if applicable and feasible for the data).
        *   Existing state-of-the-art neural DSC methods (e.g., [Whang et al., 2021; Ozyilkan et al., 2023]).
4.  **Investigate System Aspects:** Analyze the impact of hyperparameters (especially the MI regularization weight $\lambda_{MI}$ and the rate constraint weight $\beta$), different MI estimators, and network architectures on the overall compression performance and the nature of the learned latent representations.

**2.3 Significance**

This research sits squarely at the intersection of machine learning, data compression, and information theory, directly addressing the key themes of the workshop. Successful completion will offer several significant contributions:

1.  **Improved Distributed Compression:** By explicitly leveraging inter-source correlations via MI regularization in a continuous latent space, the proposed framework has the potential to achieve superior rate-distortion performance compared to existing methods, especially for data with complex, non-linear dependencies that are poorly modeled by traditional techniques or require very high-dimensional discrete latent spaces.
2.  **Theoretical Advancement:** The theoretical analysis will provide valuable insights into the connection between deep learning objectives (specifically MI regularization) and information-theoretic limits in the context of DSC. This contributes to a deeper understanding of neural compression methods, moving beyond purely empirical results.
3.  **Enabling Technology:** Enhanced distributed compression capabilities can significantly impact various technological domains:
    *   **Federated Learning:** Reduce communication overhead during gradient or model update aggregation from distributed clients by compressing correlated updates more efficiently.
    *   **IoT and Sensor Networks:** Enable efficient transmission of correlated sensor readings (e.g., temperature, humidity, imagery from nearby sensors) in bandwidth-constrained environments, improving monitoring and decision-making.
    *   **Multi-view Imaging/Video:** Improve the compression efficiency of stereo or multi-camera systems used in robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual reality.
    *   **Edge Computing:** Facilitate decentralized data processing and storage by minimizing data transfer costs between edge devices and central servers or among edge devices.
4.  **Addressing Key Challenges:** This work directly tackles several key challenges identified in the literature: modeling complex correlations, providing theoretical grounding for neural DSC, and potentially improving scalability by avoiding the complexity of extremely high-dimensional discrete codebooks.

By bridging the gap between the practical power of neural networks and the theoretical elegance of information theory for distributed systems, this research aims to catalyze progress towards more efficient and scalable information processing systems.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Research Design**

This research employs a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation. We will first formulate the MI-RegDSC framework mathematically and design the neural network architecture. Subsequently, we will analyze its theoretical connection to information-theoretic bounds. The core of the work will involve implementing the framework and conducting extensive experiments on relevant datasets to demonstrate its efficacy compared to baseline methods. Ablation studies will be performed to understand the contribution of key components, particularly the MI regularization.

**3.2 Problem Formulation**

Consider $K$ correlated continuous random sources $X_1, X_2, ..., X_K$, where $X_k \in \mathbb{R}^{d_k}$. In a distributed compression setting, each source $X_k$ is encoded independently by an encoder $f_{e,k}$ into a latent representation $Z_k \in \mathbb{R}^{m_k}$, where typically $m_k \ll d_k$. The latent representations $\{Z_k\}_{k=1}^K$ are transmitted to a central decoder (or potentially multiple decoders in other DSC scenarios, although we focus on the joint reconstruction case initially). The decoder $g_d$ uses all received latent codes $\{Z_k\}_{k=1}^K$ to produce reconstructions $\hat{X}_1, \hat{X}_2, ..., \hat{X}_K$ of the original sources. The goal is to minimize the expected distortion $D_k = E[d(X_k, \hat{X}_k)]$ for each source $k$, subject to a constraint on the total rate $R = \sum_{k=1}^K R_k$, where $R_k$ is the rate required to transmit $Z_k$.

**3.3 Proposed Framework: MI-Regulated Distributed Source Coding (MI-RegDSC)**

We propose using a VAE architecture for each source encoder-decoder path, modified for the distributed setting and incorporating MI regularization.

*   **Encoder:** Each encoder $f_{e,k}$ maps an input $X_k$ to the parameters (mean $\mu_k$ and variance $\sigma_k^2$) of a distribution $q(Z_k | X_k)$, typically assumed to be Gaussian: $q(Z_k | X_k) = \mathcal{N}(Z_k; \mu_k(X_k), \sigma_k^2(X_k)I)$. A sample $Z_k$ is drawn from this distribution using the reparameterization trick for backpropagation. $f_{e,k}$ will be implemented as a neural network (e.g., CNN for images, LSTM/Transformer for sequences).
*   **Decoder:** The joint decoder $g_d$ takes the set of all latent codes $\{Z_j\}_{j=1}^K$ as input and produces reconstructions $\{\hat{X}_k\}_{k=1}^K$. Each $\hat{X}_k = g_{d,k}(\{Z_j\}_{j=1}^K)$. $g_d$ (composed of individual $g_{d,k}$) will also be implemented as a neural network, potentially using mechanisms like cross-attention [Mital et al., 2022] to effectively fuse information from different latent codes.
*   **Prior:** We assume a simple prior distribution for the latents, typically a standard Gaussian $p(Z_k) = \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.

**Loss Function:** The networks are trained end-to-end by minimizing a composite loss function:

$$ L_{total} = \sum_{k=1}^K E_{p(X_k)} E_{q(Z_k|X_k)} [d(X_k, \hat{X}_k)] + \beta \sum_{k=1}^K KL(q(Z_k|X_k) || p(Z_k)) - \lambda_{MI} \sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{j \neq k} \hat{I}(Z_k; Z_j) $$

Where:

1.  **Reconstruction Loss:** $d(X_k, \hat{X}_k)$ is a distortion measure appropriate for the data type (e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for general data, potentially supplemented by perceptual metrics like MS-SSIM for images). $\hat{X}_k = g_{d,k}(\{Z_j\}_{j=1}^K)$. The expectation is approximated via sampling during training.
2.  **Rate Constraint (KL Divergence):** $KL(q(Z_k|X_k) || p(Z_k))$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned posterior $q(Z_k | X_k)$ and the prior $p(Z_k)$. Minimizing this term encourages the posterior to be close to the prior, effectively acting as a rate constraint within the VAE framework, approximating the rate required to encode $Z_k$. The hyperparameter $\beta$ controls the trade-off between rate and distortion. The total rate is approximately $R \approx \sum_k E_{p(X_k)}[KL(q(Z_k|X_k) || p(Z_k))]$.
3.  **Mutual Information Regularization:** $\hat{I}(Z_k; Z_j)$ is an estimate of the mutual information between the latent codes $Z_k$ and $Z_j$ sampled from their respective posteriors $q(Z_k|X_k)$ and $q(Z_j|X_j)$ within a mini-batch. Maximizing this term (by minimizing its negative) encourages the latent codes to retain shared information, thereby exploiting the correlation between the sources $X_k$ and $X_j$. The hyperparameter $\lambda_{MI}$ controls the strength of this regularization.

**Mutual Information Estimation:** Calculating MI between high-dimensional continuous variables $Z_k$ and $Z_j$ is challenging. We will explore and utilize neural MI estimators, such as:
    *   **MINE (Mutual Information Neural Estimator):** Based on the Donsker-Varadhan representation of KL divergence [Belghazi et al., 2018]. It trains a separate neural network to estimate MI.
    *   **InfoNCE:** Popularized in contrastive learning, based on noise-contrastive estimation [Oord et al., 2018; Hjelm et al., 2019]. It often provides stable gradients.
    *   **Variational Bounds:** Lower bounds on MI, such as the Barber-Agakov bound used in Information Bottleneck methods.

The choice of MI estimator will be part of the experimental investigation. The parameters of the MI estimator network (if any) will be trained concurrently with the encoder and decoder networks.

**Training:** The framework will be trained using stochastic gradient descent (e.g., Adam optimizer) on mini-batches of correlated data samples $(x_1^{(i)}, ..., x_K^{(i)})$. We will simulate the distributed encoding process, where each $f_{e,k}$ only sees $x_k^{(i)}$, generates $z_k^{(i)}$, and the decoder $g_d$ receives all $z_k^{(i)}$ for reconstruction.

**3.4 Theoretical Analysis**

We will analyze the proposed framework from an information-theoretic perspective:
*   Relate the components of the loss function to the rate-distortion function for distributed sources. The $KL$ term relates to the individual rates $R_k$, while the reconstruction term relates to distortion $D_k$. The MI term $\hat{I}(Z_k; Z_j)$ explicitly encourages capturing the correlation that allows for rate savings according to Slepian-Wolf theory ($R_1 + R_2 \ge H(X_1, X_2)$ vs. $R_1 \ge H(X_1|X_2), R_2 \ge H(X_2|X_1)$).
*   Analyze how maximizing $I(Z_k; Z_j)$ influences the structure of the latent space and potentially allows the system to approach theoretical DSC bounds, especially for continuous sources where binning is non-trivial.
*   Discuss the trade-offs controlled by $\beta$ and $\lambda_{MI}$. Increasing $\lambda_{MI}$ should, in principle, improve the exploitation of correlation, potentially allowing for lower rates at the same distortion (or lower distortion at the same rate), compared to $\lambda_{MI}=0$ (independent coding) or methods relying solely on decoder fusion.
*   Compare the continuous latent space approach with methods relying on VQ-VAE [Whang et al., 2021] or learned binning [Ozyilkan et al., 2023], discussing potential advantages in handling complex continuous correlations without quantization artifacts or the need for large codebooks.

**3.5 Experimental Design**

*   **Datasets:**
    *   *Synthetic Correlated Data:* Start with multivariate Gaussian sources with controllable correlation strength to precisely study the effect of $\lambda_{MI}$.
    *   *Multi-view Imagery:* Use stereo image datasets like Cityscapes Stereo [Mayer et al., 2016] or KITTI Stereo [Geiger et al., 2012]. $X_1$ and $X_2$ are the left and right images.
    *   *Multi-sensor Data:* Utilize datasets like the Intel Berkeley Research Lab dataset [http://db.lcs.mit.edu/labdata/labdata.html] containing correlated sensor readings (temperature, humidity, light) from distributed motes, or potentially simulated correlated time series data relevant to industrial IoT.
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  *Independent VAE Compression:* Train separate VAEs for each source ($K=1$ model applied independently, or setting $\lambda_{MI}=0$ and training separate decoders $g_{d,k}(Z_k)$). This establishes the upper bound on rate for a given distortion without exploiting correlation.
    2.  *VAE with Decoder Fusion ($\lambda_{MI}=0$):* Train the proposed architecture but set $\lambda_{MI}=0$. This evaluates the benefit gained *only* from the joint decoder using all latent codes (similar to some existing neural Wyner-Ziv approaches if one source is considered primary).
    3.  *Classical DSC:* If feasible for the data complexity (likely only for simpler synthetic data), implement a basic Slepian-Wolf or Wyner-Ziv scheme using standard quantization and coding techniques (e.g., scalar quantization + LDPC codes simulated over a noiseless channel).
    4.  *State-of-the-Art Neural DSC:* Implement or adapt methods like Neural Distributed Source Coding (NDSC) using VQ-VAE [Whang et al., 2021] or the Wyner-Ziv VAE with binning discovery [Ozyilkan et al., 2023] if code is available or reimplementation is feasible. Compare performance on the same datasets.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   *Rate:* Estimated as the sum of average KL divergences $R \approx \frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_k E[KL(q(Z_k|X_k) || p(Z_k))]$ (in bits per sample/dimension). For VQ methods, rate is $\log_2(\text{codebook size})$.
    *   *Distortion:*
        *   Images: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), or Multi-Scale SSIM (MS-SSIM).
        *   Sensor Data/Synthetic: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
    *   *Rate-Distortion (R-D) Curves:* Plot Distortion vs. Rate by varying the $\beta$ hyperparameter for each method. Compare the curves to assess performance across different operating points. The impact of $\lambda_{MI}$ will be shown by plotting R-D curves for different $\lambda_{MI}$ values.
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    *   Vary the MI regularization weight $\lambda_{MI}$ to show its impact on the R-D performance.
    *   Compare different MI estimators (MINE, InfoNCE, etc.) in terms of stability, performance, and computational cost.
    *   Analyze the effect of the latent dimension $m_k$.
    *   Visualize latent spaces (e.g., using t-SNE) to qualitatively assess how MI regularization structures the representations of correlated sources.

Its potential improvements over existing methods and its applicability to numerous real-world scenarios underscore its significance and potential impact.
