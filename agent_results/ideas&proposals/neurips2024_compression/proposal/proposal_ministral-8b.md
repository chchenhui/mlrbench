# Neural Distributed Compression of Correlated Sources via Mutual Information Regularization

## Introduction

The exponential growth of data in various domains necessitates efficient compression techniques to manage storage and transmission costs. Machine learning (ML) and compression have emerged as two complementary fields, with recent advancements in deep learning-based compression methods setting new benchmarks for image, video, and audio data. However, many challenges remain, particularly in distributed settings where data sources are correlated and often located on different nodes or devices. Traditional methods like Slepian-Wolf theorem-based quantization struggle with complex, high-dimensional correlations, while emerging neural compression methods lack theoretical grounding and adaptation to distributed settings.

This research presents a novel approach to address these challenges by proposing a **mutual information (MI)-regularized neural framework** for distributed compression of correlated continuous sources. By leveraging variational autoencoders (VAEs) and maximizing mutual information between latent codes of correlated sources, our method aims to improve efficiency and enable applications like decentralized IoT systems. This proposal outlines the research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes, drawing from recent advancements in neural compression and information theory.

This could lead to more efficient IoT systems, improved federated learning, and better communication protocols in low-bandwidth networks.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed methodology involves developing a MI-regularized neural framework for distributed compression of correlated continuous sources. The framework consists of two main components: an encoder and a decoder, each implemented as a neural network with a VAE structure. The encoder maps the input data to a latent space, while the decoder reconstructs the data from the latent codes. The key innovation lies in the mutual information regularization term, which ensures that the latent codes of correlated sources are maximally informative about each other.

#### Encoder

The encoder takes an input source \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) and maps it to a latent space \( z \in \mathbb{R}^m \) using a neural network \( f_{\theta} \):

\[ z = f_{\theta}(x) \]

where \( \theta \) represents the network parameters.

#### Decoder

The decoder takes the latent code \( z \) and reconstructs the input data \( \hat{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \) using a neural network \( g_{\phi} \):

\[ \hat{x} = g_{\phi}(z) \]

where \( \phi \) represents the network parameters.

#### Mutual Information Regularization

The mutual information (MI) regularization term is added to the loss function to encourage the encoder to produce latent codes that are maximally informative about each other. The MI between the latent codes of two correlated sources \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \) is defined as:

\[ \text{MI}(z_1, z_2) = \mathbb{E}_{z_1, z_2} \left[ \log \frac{p(z_1, z_2)}{p(z_1)p(z_2)} \right] \]

where \( p(z_1, z_2) \) is the joint probability distribution of \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \), and \( p(z_1) \) and \( p(z_2) \) are the marginal probability distributions.

The MI regularization term is incorporated into the loss function as follows:

\[ \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}} + \lambda \text{MI}(z_1, z_2) \]

where \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}} \) is the reconstruction loss, and \( \lambda \) is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the MI regularization.

### Experimental Design

To validate the proposed method, experiments will be conducted on two datasets: multi-view imagery and wireless sensor data. The datasets will be preprocessed to include correlated sources, and the following baseline methods will be compared:

1. **Slepian-Wolf Theorem-Based Quantization**: A classical method for distributed compression of correlated sources.
2. **Neural Compression**: A deep learning-based method that does not incorporate mutual information regularization.
3. **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**: A neural network-based method for data compression that does not consider correlations between sources.

The evaluation metrics will include:

1. **Compression Rate**: The ratio of the original data size to the compressed data size.
2. **Reconstruction Error**: The difference between the original data and the reconstructed data, measured using mean squared error (MSE).
3. **Mutual Information**: The amount of information shared between the latent codes of correlated sources.

### Mathematical Formulation

The objective function for the proposed MI-regularized neural framework can be formulated as:

\[ \min_{\theta, \phi} \mathcal{L} = \min_{\theta, \phi} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{MSE}(x_i, \hat{x}_i) + \lambda \text{MI}(z_1, z_2) \right) \]

where \( \text{MSE}(x_i, \hat{x}_i) \) is the mean squared error between the original data \( x_i \) and the reconstructed data \( \hat{x}_i \).

The optimization problem is solved using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation to update the network parameters \( \theta \) and \( \phi \).

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Improved Compression Rates**: The proposed MI-regularized neural framework is expected to achieve higher compression rates compared to baseline methods, especially when dealing with correlated data sources.
2. **Theoretical Foundations**: Establishing theoretical bounds and analyzing the achievable rate-distortion performance of the proposed method will provide insights into the fundamental limits of neural compression in distributed settings.
3. **Practical Implications**: Successful validation on real-world datasets will demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method for applications such as federated learning, edge computing, and low-bandwidth communication networks.

### Impact

The successful development and validation of the proposed MI-regularized neural framework have the potential to significantly impact the field of machine learning and compression. By enhancing compression techniques and enabling efficient distributed systems with theoretical guarantees, our work could lead to:

1. **Efficient IoT Systems**: Improved compression methods could enable more efficient data transmission and storage in IoT devices, reducing energy consumption and extending battery life.
2. **Enhanced Federated Learning**: Efficient distributed compression could facilitate more scalable and robust federated learning systems, enabling collaborative model training across decentralized nodes.
3. **Better Communication Protocols**: The proposed method could contribute to the development of more efficient communication protocols for low-bandwidth networks, improving data transmission rates and reducing latency.

In conclusion, the proposed research aims to bridge the gap between neural compression methods and theoretical information theory, addressing the challenges of distributed compression of correlated data sources.
