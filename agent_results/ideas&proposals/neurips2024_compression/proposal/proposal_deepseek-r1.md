### 2. Introduction  

#### **Background**  
Distributed compression of correlated data—where multiple sources encode data independently without communication—has traditionally relied on the Slepian-Wolf theorem, which prescribes theoretical rate limits under strict assumptions of known correlation structures. However, modern applications, such as multi-sensor IoT systems or federated learning, involve high-dimensional data with non-linear and complex dependencies that classical methods fail to model efficiently. Recent advances in neural compression, particularly variational autoencoders (VAEs) and vector-quantized models, have demonstrated superior performance in capturing intricate data distributions but often lack theoretical guarantees in distributed settings. Bridging the gap between neural methods and information-theoretic principles is critical to enabling scalable, correlation-aware compression systems for real-world scenarios.

#### **Research Objectives**  
1. Develop a **mutual information (MI)-regularized neural framework** for distributed compression of correlated continuous sources.  
2. Establish theoretical connections between MI regularization and achievable rate-distortion bounds, comparing them to Slepian-Wolf limits.  
3. Validate the framework experimentally on multi-view imagery and wireless sensor data, demonstrating improvements over classical and neural baselines.  

#### **Significance**  
This work aims to unify neural flexibility with information-theoretic rigor, enabling efficient distributed systems where sources share implicit correlations. Successful outcomes could transform applications like edge computing, low-bandwidth communication, and federated learning by providing high compression rates with provable guarantees.

### 3. Methodology  

#### **Research Design**  

**Data Collection**  
- **Multi-view Imagery**: KITTI Stereo dataset, featuring spatially correlated stereo image pairs.  
- **Wireless Sensor Data**: UCI Condition Monitoring of Hydraulic Systems, containing time-series sensor readings with temporal and spatial dependencies.  
- Synthetic datasets with controlled correlation structures for ablation studies.  

**Algorithmic Framework**  
The proposed architecture (Fig. 1) consists of distributed neural encoders and a joint decoder:  
1. **Encoders**: Each source $X_i$ is encoded by a VAE-based network $E_i$ into a continuous latent code $Z_i = E_i(X_i)$.  
2. **Mutual Information Regularization**: Maximize $I(Z_i; Z_j)$ for correlated sources $X_i$ and $X_j$ using a variational lower bound.  
3. **Decoder**: A neural network $D$ reconstructs $\hat{X}_i$ from $Z_i$ and side information (e.g., $Z_j$ for distributed decoding).  

**Loss Function**  
The training objective combines reconstruction error and MI regularization:  
$$
\mathcal{L} = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}\left[\|X_i - \hat{X}_i\|^2\right]}_{\text{Distortion}} - \lambda \sum_{i \neq j} \underbrace{I(Z_i; Z_j)}_{\text{Mutual Information}},  
$$  
where $\lambda$ balances the trade-off.  

**Mutual Information Estimation**  
Using the InfoNCE bound:  
$$
I(Z_i; Z_j) \geq \mathbb{E}\left[\log \frac{e^{f(z_i, z_j)}}{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^N e^{f(z_i, z_j^{(k)})}}\right],  
$$  
where $f(z_i, z_j)$ is a learnable critic network.  

**Theoretical Analysis**  
We derive rate-distortion bounds using the information bottleneck principle:  
$$
\min_{p(z|x)} I(X; Z) - \beta I(Z; Y),
$$  
where $Y$ denotes correlated side information. By incorporating MI regularization between latent codes, we demonstrate that the framework asymptotically approaches Slepian-Wolf limits while accommodating non-linear correlations.  

**Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**:  
  - Classical: Slepian-Wolf-based quantization, distributed JPEG2000.  
  - Neural: VQ-VAE, cross-attention models (arXiv:2207.08489), and conditional VAEs.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Rate-Distortion Curves**: Bits per pixel (bpp) vs. PSNR/SSIM for images; MSE for sensor data.  
  - **Computational Efficiency**: Inference time, model size, and communication cost (bits transmitted).  
  - **Theoretical Validation**: Comparison of empirical rates to derived bounds.  
- **Ablation Studies**: Varying $\lambda$, network depth, and correlation strength.  

**Implementation Details**  
- Encoders/Decoders: Convolutional layers for images; LSTMs for sensor data.  
- Training: Adam optimizer ($\text{lr}=10^{-4}$), batch size 64, $\lambda$ swept from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-1}$.  
- Hardware: NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

#### **Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Rate-Distortion Performance**: The MI-regularized framework is expected to achieve **10–20% lower bit rates** than neural baselines at equivalent distortion levels, particularly in high-correlation regimes.  
2. **Theoretical Guarantees**: Derivation of rate-distortion bounds showing that MI regularization tightens the gap between neural methods and Slepian-Wolf limits.  
3. **Scalability**: Demonstration of efficient compression for up to 10 distributed sources with linear scaling in computation.
