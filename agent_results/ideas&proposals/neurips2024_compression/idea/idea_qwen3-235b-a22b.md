1. **Title**: *Perceptual Rate-Distortion Optimization via Learned Information-Theoretic Metrics*  

2. **Motivation**:  
Data compression, particularly for high-dimensional signals like images or videos, faces a critical challenge: balancing compression efficiency with perceptual fidelity. While classical rate-distortion theory provides theoretical bounds, deep learning-based compressors often ignore or oversimplify perceptual realism metrics. This gap leads to suboptimal designs where models either sacrifice quality or incur unnecessary computational costs. Developing adaptive, learnable distortions grounded in information theory could enable compressors to retain perceptually salient details while approaching theoretical limits, with broad applications in streaming, storage, and privacy-preserving systems.  

3. **Main Idea**:  
This work proposes integrating neural perceptual metrics into rate-distortion optimization (RDO) via a learnable distortion function trained alongside a deep compression model. Instead of relying on fixed metrics (e.g., PSNR or SSIM), we train a neural network to approximate an information-theoretic distortion measure, such as the perceptual similarity metric derived from a pre-trained vision transformer. The compressor is optimized using a modified RDO objective: $ \min \text{Rate} + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{D}_{\text{perceptual}} $, where $ \lambda $ is adaptively adjusted via Lagrange multipliers. We further incorporate a complexity regularizer to enforce computational efficiency. Empirical validation on image/video datasets (e.g., KITTI, Kinetics) will benchmark against traditional codecs (VVC, AV1) and learned methods (HiFiC), focusing on perceptual quality (LPIPS, DISTS) vs. bitrate. Theoretically, this work establishes connections between neural compression, earth moverâ€™s distance, and perceptual manifolds, aiming to tighten bounds on achievable distortion for pre-trained perceptual models. Expected outcomes include both a practical framework for adaptive compression and a foundational understanding of how perceptual metrics reshape rate-distortion boundaries.
