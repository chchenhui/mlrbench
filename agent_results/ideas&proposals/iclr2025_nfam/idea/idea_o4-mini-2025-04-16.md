Title: Hybrid Diffusion-Hopfield Network for Memory-Augmented Generation

Motivation:  
Diffusion models achieve remarkable generative quality but lack mechanisms to leverage past experiences or consolidated concept memories. Integrating associative memory can enable diffusion pipelines to recall and enforce consistency with stored high-level patterns, improving sample coherence, diversity, and controllability.

Main Idea:  
We propose embedding a modern continuous‐valued Hopfield network inside each reverse‐diffusion step. At time t, the noisy latent z_t serves as a “partial key” to query a Hopfield module that stores representative concept vectors (e.g., object classes or styles). The retrieved memory vector modulates the denoising score network via additive bias or gating, steering generation toward memory-consistent manifolds. Training minimizes a joint objective: the standard diffusion ELBO plus an energy-based memory loss that encourages z_t to converge to stored attractors. We evaluate on conditional image and text generation, demonstrating enhanced fidelity to target concepts, reduced mode collapse, and rapid few-shot adaptation. This architecture bridges energy-based associative memories and diffusion models, unlocking memory-driven generative AI.
