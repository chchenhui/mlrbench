**Title:** Concept Bottleneck Models for Discovering Novel Climate Teleconnections

**Motivation:** Understanding large-scale climate patterns (teleconnections) like ENSO is crucial for long-range weather forecasting and climate change projection. While deep learning models show promise in prediction, their black-box nature hinders the discovery of potentially new or subtle atmospheric/oceanic precursor patterns or interactions that drive these teleconnections.

**Main Idea:** We propose using Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for climate teleconnection prediction (e.g., predicting ENSO state 6 months ahead). The model's bottleneck layer will be explicitly trained to represent predefined, physically meaningful climate variables or indices (e.g., sea surface temperature anomalies in specific regions, atmospheric pressure gradients). By analyzing the activations and importance weights of these concept neurons, we can understand which known physical factors the model uses. More importantly, by allowing the model to learn *residual* or combined concepts beyond the predefined ones, and using post-hoc XAI (like SHAP or Integrated Gradients) on these novel concept activations, we aim to identify previously unrecognized precursor patterns or interactions in climate data that contribute significantly to teleconnection predictability, thus potentially discovering new climate science insights.
