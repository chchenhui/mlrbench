### Title: Enhancing Climate Prediction Models with Explainable AI

### Motivation
Climate models are crucial for understanding and predicting climate change, but their complexity often makes it difficult to interpret their behavior and results. This lack of interpretability can hinder trust in these models, leading to skepticism and misinformation. By incorporating explainable AI (XAI) techniques, we can improve the transparency and reliability of climate prediction models, enabling better decision-making and fostering public trust.

### Main Idea
The proposed research focuses on developing and integrating a-posteriori interpretability methods into climate prediction models. This involves using attribution techniques to identify the key factors contributing to specific predictions. By applying these methods, we aim to:

1. **Methodology**: Implement attribution algorithms such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyze the outputs of climate models. These methods will help in understanding how different variables, such as temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric pressure, influence the model's predictions.

2. **Expected Outcomes**: The research will yield interpretable climate models that can clearly show the impact of different factors on predictions. This will enable scientists and policymakers to better understand the underlying mechanisms of climate change and make more informed decisions.

3. **Potential Impact**: Improved interpretability will enhance the credibility of climate models, leading to greater public acceptance and trust. This can facilitate more effective climate policies and actions to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Additionally, the research will contribute to the broader field of explainable AI by demonstrating practical applications in a critical scientific domain.
