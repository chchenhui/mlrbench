# Knowledge-Guided Self-Explainable Models for Biomedical Discovery

## 1. Introduction

Machine learning (ML) models have revolutionized various domains, including healthcare, by providing accurate predictions and insights. However, the opacity of these models often hinders their adoption and trust in clinical settings. The lack of interpretability in black-box models makes it difficult for healthcare professionals to understand the rationale behind predictions, thus impeding their ability to act on the insights provided by these models. Moreover, the absence of transparency can limit the discovery of new scientific knowledge, such as novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

To address these challenges, we propose the development of **knowledge-guided self-explainable models** that integrate biomedical ontologies into graph neural networks (GNNs) and additive models. These models will explicitly encode interpretable entities and relations, enabling end-to-end learning of biological processes. By embedding domain knowledge into the model architecture, we aim to bridge model predictivity with human-understandable insights, fostering trust and advancing precision medicine.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. To develop a novel framework for integrating biomedical ontologies into GNNs and additive models.
2. To design self-explainable models that can uncover subpopulation-specific mechanisms in cancer treatment response.
3. To evaluate the predictive performance and interpretability of the proposed models using a hybrid evaluation framework.
4. To validate the discovered insights through wet-lab experiments or clinical trials.

### Significance

The significance of this research lies in its potential to:
- Enhance the trust and adoption of AI in clinical practice by providing interpretable and actionable insights.
- Foster collaboration between AI researchers and domain experts to uncover new scientific knowledge.
- Advance precision medicine by identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
- Develop a generalizable framework for integrating domain knowledge into ML models, with applications beyond healthcare.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Research Design

#### 2.1.1 Data Collection

We will collect biomedical datasets from public repositories, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). These datasets will include gene expression profiles, clinical information, and relevant ontological data, such as gene interaction networks and pharmacokinetic pathways. We will curate and preprocess the data to ensure its suitability for the proposed models.

#### 2.1.2 Model Architecture

We will design a hybrid model that combines GNNs and additive models to leverage the strengths of both approaches. The architecture will consist of the following components:

1. **Biomedical Ontology Embedding Layer**: This layer will encode biomedical entities (e.g., genes, drugs) and relations (e.g., interactions, pathways) using embedding techniques, such as word2vec or FastText. The embeddings will capture semantic information and facilitate the integration of domain knowledge into the model.
2. **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) Layers**: The GCN layers will process the graph-structured data, capturing the relationships between entities. We will use attention mechanisms to focus on relevant entities and relations, enabling the model to learn subpopulation-specific mechanisms.
3. **Additive Model Layers**: The additive model layers will process the node features and graph-level information, enabling the model to capture complex interactions between entities. We will use techniques such as attention mechanisms or convolutional layers to enhance interpretability.
4. **Explainability Module**: This module will generate explanations for the model's predictions, highlighting the most influential entities and relations. We will use techniques such as LIME or SHAP to compute feature importance and identify key drivers of the model's decisions.

#### 2.1.3 Training Procedure

We will train the proposed models using a supervised learning approach, with the goal of predicting clinical outcomes (e.g., survival) and uncovering subpopulation-specific mechanisms. The training procedure will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Curate and preprocess the biomedical datasets, ensuring they are suitable for the proposed models.
2. **Model Initialization**: Initialize the model parameters using appropriate techniques, such as Xavier initialization.
3. **Training Loop**: Train the model using an optimization algorithm, such as Adam or SGD, with a suitable learning rate. We will use cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability and prevent overfitting.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model's hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using a hybrid evaluation framework that assesses both predictive accuracy and interpretability.

#### 2.1.4 Evaluation Metrics

We will use a hybrid evaluation framework that combines predictive performance and interpretability metrics. The evaluation metrics will include:

1. **Predictive Performance Metrics**: We will use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) to assess the model's predictive accuracy.
2. **Interpretability Metrics**: We will use metrics such as feature importance, model transparency, and alignment with known biology to assess the model's interpretability. For example, we will compute the SHAP values for the model's predictions and compare them with known biological pathways.
3. **Clinical Relevance Metrics**: We will evaluate the clinical relevance of the discovered insights by assessing their alignment with known biological mechanisms and their potential impact on patient outcomes.

### 2.2 Experimental Design

To validate the proposed method, we will conduct a series of experiments using real-world biomedical datasets. The experimental design will involve the following steps:

1. **Baseline Models**: Train and evaluate baseline models, such as traditional GNNs or additive models, to establish a performance benchmark.
2. **Proposed Models**: Train and evaluate the proposed knowledge-guided self-explainable models using the hybrid evaluation framework.
3. **Ablation Studies**: Conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component in the proposed model architecture.
4. **Domain Expert Validation**: Validate the discovered insights with domain experts through wet-lab experiments or clinical trials.
5. **Generalization Analysis**: Evaluate the model's generalization performance across diverse biomedical datasets and scales.
