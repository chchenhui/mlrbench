# Research Proposal: Knowledge-Guided Self-Explainable Models for Biomedical Discovery  

---

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized healthcare applications, yet black-box models hinder clinical trust and scientific discovery. Interpretability is critical in domains like precision medicine, where understanding *why* a model makes a prediction is as important as its accuracy. Current approaches either prioritize performance over transparency (e.g., deep neural networks) or rely on post-hoc explanations (e.g., SHAP, LIME) that may lack fidelity to the model’s inner workings. This gap limits the potential of ML to uncover novel biological mechanisms or therapeutic targets.  

Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) and additive models offer opportunities to embed domain knowledge (e.g., gene ontologies, pharmacokinetic pathways) directly into architectures, enabling *self-explainable* models. Such models balance predictive power with interpretability by design, aligning learned representations with established biomedical principles.  

### Research Objectives  
1. Develop **knowledge-guided self-explainable models** that integrate biomedical ontologies into GNNs and additive models.  
2. Enable end-to-end learning of interpretable biological entities (e.g., genes, drugs) and their mechanistic relationships.  
3. Validate model-derived insights (e.g., biomarkers, drug targets) through expert evaluation and experimental assays.  
4. Create a hybrid evaluation framework assessing both predictive accuracy and scientific utility.  

### Significance  
This work bridges the gap between ML and mechanistic understanding in biomedicine. By prioritizing interpretability *during* model design, it fosters trust among clinicians and accelerates discoveries in precision medicine, such as identifying disease subtypes or synergistic therapies.

## 2. Methodology  

### Research Design  
**2.1 Data Collection**  
- **Datasets**:  
  - *Genomics*: TCGA (cancer genomics), GTEx (gene expression).  
  - *Clinical*: MIMIC-III (critical care), UK Biobank (multi-modal health data).  
  - *Biomedical Ontologies*: Gene Ontology (GO), DrugBank (drug-target interactions), Reactome (pathway databases).  
- **Preprocessing**: Convert ontologies into heterogeneous graphs where nodes represent biological entities (genes, drugs) and edges denote functional relationships (e.g., regulatory interactions).  

**2.2 Model Architecture**  
The framework combines **GNNs** (for graph-structured knowledge) and **additive models** (for tabular clinical data) (Figure 1).  

**A. Knowledge-Guided GNN Module**  
- Input: Patient-specific biomolecular graph (e.g., gene regulatory networks).  
- Architecture:  
  1. **Prior-Enhanced Graph Attention Layer**:  
     Computes attention coefficients by incorporating edge semantics (e.g., interaction type, confidence score) from ontologies:  
     $$
     \alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp\left(\text{LeakyReLU}\left(\mathbf{a}^T [W h_i \| W h_j \| e_{ij}]\right)\right)}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \exp\left(\text{LeakyReLU}\left(\mathbf{a}^T [W h_i \| W h_j \| e_{ik}]\right)\right)}
     $$  
     where $h_i, h_j$ are node embeddings, $e_{ij}$ is the ontology-derived edge feature, and $\mathbf{a}$, $W$ are learnable parameters.  
  2. **Hierarchical Pooling**: Aggregates node features into interpretable subgraphs (e.g., pathways) using attention weights.  

**B. Additive Model Module**  
- Input: Clinical variables (e.g., lab results, demographics).  
- Architecture:  
  $$
  g(E[y]) = \beta_0 + f_1(x_1) + f_2(x_2) + \dots + f_n(x_n)
  $$  
  where $f_i$ are shape-constrained spline functions to ensure monotonicity or smoothness, aligned with clinical intuition.  

**C. Joint Training**  
Optimize a hybrid loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}
$$  
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}}$: Task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy for survival prediction).  
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$: Interpretability regularization (e.g., sparsity in attention weights, alignment with known pathways).  

**2.3 Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against (1) black-box models (e.g., DNNs), (2) post-hoc XAI methods (e.g., GNNExplainer), and (3) interpretable models (e.g., IA-GCN).  
- **Metrics**:  
  - *Predictive Performance*: AUC-ROC, C-index (survival analysis).  
  - *Explainability*:  
    - **Faithfulness**: Perturb explanation-highlighted features and measure prediction shift.  
    - **Consistency**: Compare explanations across similar patients.  
    - **Expert Alignment**: Domain experts score explanations (1–5 Likert scale) for biological plausibility.  
- **Validation Pipeline**:  
  1. *In Silico*: Check if novel biomarkers overlap with pathways in GO/Reactome.  
  2. *In Vitro/In Vivo*: Collaborate with biologists to test therapeutic hypotheses (e.g., CRISPR knockout of predicted gene targets).

### Broader Implications  
1. Enhanced trust in ML systems among clinicians, accelerating adoption in healthcare.  
2. A paradigm shift toward **collaborative AI**, where models serve as hypothesis generators for scientists.
