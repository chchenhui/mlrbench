### Title: Unifying Reasoning and Decision-Making in Open-World Agents through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

### Motivation:
The ability to reason and make decisions in open-world environments is crucial for developing AI agents that can generalize and adapt to novel situations. Current AI systems often specialize in specific tasks and environments, lacking the flexibility and robustness required for open-world scenarios. By unifying reasoning and decision-making, we can create more versatile and intelligent agents capable of handling the dynamic and unpredictable nature of real-world challenges.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research focuses on developing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) frameworks to unify reasoning and decision-making in open-world environments. The methodology involves training a team of agents that can collaborate to perform complex tasks, such as dialogue-based reasoning and planning, while leveraging prior knowledge and continuous learning. The agents will be designed to communicate and coordinate their actions, facilitating the integration of reasoning and decision-making processes.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved generalization and adaptability of AI agents in open-world environments.
- Enhanced performance in tasks that require both reasoning and decision-making, such as dialogue systems and autonomous robots.
- Development of a theoretical framework for open-world reasoning and decision-making, based on the principles of multi-agent systems.

Potential impact:
- The research will contribute to the development of more intelligent and adaptable AI agents, capable of handling real-world challenges.
- The proposed MARL framework can be applied to various domains, including game AI, robotics, and workflow automation, leading to practical applications and innovations.
- The study will foster collaboration among researchers from different fields, promoting a unified approach to open-world reasoning and decision-making.
