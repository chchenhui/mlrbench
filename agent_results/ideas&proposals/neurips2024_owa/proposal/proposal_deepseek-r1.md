### 2. **Introduction**  

#### **Background**  
Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to remarkable progress in specialized tasks such as game playing, language modeling, and robotic manipulation. However, these systems often operate in static, constrained environments and lack the ability to generalize to dynamic, open-world settings. Open-world environments—characterized by infinite tasks, non-stationary dynamics, and unstructured interactions—require agents capable of seamless integration between *reasoning* (e.g., task abstraction, symbolic planning) and *decision-making* (e.g., real-time control, adaptive exploration). While large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and knowledge synthesis, and reinforcement learning (RL) enables adaptive decision-making, combining these paradigms remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often treat reasoning and decision-making as isolated components, leading to inefficiencies in knowledge transfer, poor generalization to unseen scenarios, and high reliance on human supervision.

#### **Research Objectives**  
This research aims to develop a unified architecture that synergizes reasoning (via LLMs) and decision-making (via RL) through a shared, dynamic knowledge repository. The key objectives are:  
1. **Design a hybrid framework** where LLMs generate high-level plans using prior knowledge, while RL policies execute low-level actions guided by environmental feedback.  
2. **Enable continuous knowledge integration** by dynamically updating the repository with task-specific experiences, enhancing cross-task generalization.  
3. **Minimize human supervision** by leveraging self-supervised learning for aligning reasoning and action spaces.  
4. **Validate the framework** in open-world simulations (e.g., Minecraft, robotics environments) to quantify improvements in sample efficiency, adaptability, and task completion.  

#### **Significance**  
By unifying reasoning and decision-making, this work will advance the development of autonomous agents capable of operating in complex, real-world scenarios such as disaster response robotics, personalized AI assistants, and adaptive game AI. The proposed architecture addresses critical gaps in open-world AI, including knowledge reuse, combinatorial task generalization, and reduced dependence on explicit programming or human feedback.

### 3. **Methodology**  

#### **Architecture Overview**  
The proposed framework consists of four core components (Figure 1):  
1. **LLM-Based Reasoning Module**: Generates high-level plans and subgoals using commonsense knowledge.  
2. **RL-Based Decision-Making Module**: Executes low-level actions and adapts to environmental feedback.  
3. **Dynamic Knowledge Repository**: Stores task-specific experiences and updates via self-supervised learning.  
4. **Contrastive Alignment Layer**: Aligns LLM-generated subgoals with RL state representations.  

#### **Data Collection and Pretraining**  
**Data Sources**:  
- **Task Descriptions**: Pretrain the LLM on synthetically generated open-world tasks (e.g., "build a shelter in Minecraft," "navigate a cluttered room").  
- **Commonsense Knowledge**: Integrate structured knowledge bases (e.g., ConceptNet, WikiData) to imbue the LLM with prior knowledge.  
- **Simulated Environments**: Use Minecraft, AI2-THOR, and Habitat-Sim to generate interactive environments with procedurally varied tasks.  

**LLM Pretraining**:  
The LLM is fine-tuned using a masked language modeling objective on task instructions paired with expert demonstration sequences. For a task instruction $I$ and demonstration trajectory $\tau$, the loss is:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{LLM}} = -\mathbb{E}_{(I, \tau)} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^T \log P_\theta(a_t | I, s_t) \right],  
$$  
where $\theta$ represents LLM parameters, $s_t$ is the state at step $t$, and $a_t$ is the expert action.  

#### **RL Training and Contrastive Alignment**  
**Self-Play in Simulated Environments**:  
The RL agent interacts with the environment using a modified Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The policy $\pi_\phi$ is trained to maximize a sparse reward $R$ while guided by LLM-generated subgoals $g$:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}} = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\phi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t \left( R(s_t, a_t) + \lambda \cdot \text{sim}(g_t, s_t) \right) \right],  
$$  
where $\text{sim}(g_t, s_t)$ measures alignment between subgoal $g_t$ and state $s_t$, and $\lambda$ is a weighting factor.  

**Contrastive Learning for Subgoal-State Alignment**:  
A contrastive loss ensures that LLM-generated subgoals $g$ align with RL state embeddings $e(s)$:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{align}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(g, e(s^+)) / \tau)}{\sum_{i=1}^N \exp(\text{sim}(g, e(s_i)) / \tau)},  
$$  
where $s^+$ denotes positive state matches, $s_i$ includes negative samples, and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.  

#### **Dynamic Knowledge Integration**  
**Experience Replay with Priority**:  
The repository stores tuples $(s, a, g, r, s')$ with priority scores based on *novelty* (measured by prediction error) and *uncertainty* (via Bayesian neural networks). High-priority experiences are sampled for retraining the LLM and RL policy.  

**Knowledge Graph Updates**:  
New interactions are structured into a temporal knowledge graph, where nodes represent entities (e.g., objects, locations) and edges encode relationships (e.g., "supports," "prevents"). Graph neural networks propagate updates to the LLM’s reasoning module.  

#### **Experimental Design**  
**Baselines**:  
- **LOOP (Chen et al., 2025)**: RL-driven LLM agent.  
- **LLaMA-Rider (Feng et al., 2023)**: Exploration-focused LLM.  
- **WebRL (Qi et al., 2024)**: Curriculum RL for web agents.  

**Environments**:  
- **Minecraft**: Tasks require multi-step reasoning (e.g., crafting tools, surviving hazards).  
- **AI2-THOR**: Object manipulation in household settings.  
- **ProcTHOR**: Procedurally generated navigation challenges.  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
1. **Success Rate**: Percentage of tasks completed within time limits.  
2. **Sample Efficiency**: Learning curves comparing episodes to task mastery.  
3. **Generalization**: Zero-shot performance on unseen tasks.  
4. **Human Supervision**: Frequency of human interventions needed.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

#### **Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Generalization**: The framework will achieve >20% higher success rates on unseen tasks compared to baselines in Minecraft and AI2-THOR.  
2. **Reduced Sample Complexity**: Knowledge reuse via the dynamic repository will cut training time by 30–50% for new tasks.  
3. **Emergent Multi-Task Completion**: Agents will solve combinatorial tasks (e.g., "gather resources, build a hut, and defend against enemies") without explicit programming.  
4. **Ethical Robustness**: Built-in safeguards (e.g., uncertainty-aware exploration) will minimize harmful behaviors during open-world interactions.  

#### **Broader Impact**  
This work will advance the development of autonomous systems that operate in unstructured environments, with applications in:  
- **Disaster Response Robotics**: Agents capable of adapting to dynamic hazards and novel obstacles.  
- **Personalized AI Assistants**: Systems that infer user intent through contextual reasoning and execute complex workflows.  
- **Game AI**: NPCs that evolve strategies based on player behavior.  
By open-sourcing the framework and simulation benchmarks, we aim to catalyze research into unified reasoning-decision-making paradigms, while fostering discussions on ethical AI in open-world settings.
