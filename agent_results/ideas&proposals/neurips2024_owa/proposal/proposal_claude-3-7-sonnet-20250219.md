# Dynamic Knowledge Integration Framework for Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning in Open-World Agents

## 1. Introduction

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to remarkable achievements in specialized domains, from image recognition to natural language processing. However, the real world presents challenges that transcend the boundaries of single tasks or static environments. Open-world environments—characterized by their diversity, dynamism, and infinite task space—require agents capable of both abstract reasoning and concrete decision-making. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities and reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled adaptive decision-making, these two paradigms have largely developed in isolation from each other.

The disconnect between reasoning and decision-making systems represents a significant barrier to developing truly adaptable open-world agents. Current approaches face several critical limitations: (1) poor generalization to unseen tasks, (2) inefficient knowledge transfer across domains, (3) inability to balance exploration with reasoning-driven planning, and (4) heavy reliance on human supervision. These limitations have hindered the deployment of AI systems in complex real-world scenarios that require both creative problem-solving and precise action execution, such as disaster response robotics, personalized AI assistants, and autonomous vehicles navigating novel environments.

This research proposes a Dynamic Knowledge Integration Framework (DKIF) that unifies language-based reasoning with reinforcement learning-based decision-making through a shared, continuously evolving knowledge repository. The framework enables bidirectional information flow between high-level planning and low-level execution, creating agents that can reason about their experiences and learn from their reasoning processes. This integration addresses a fundamental question in the development of open-world agents: How can systems effectively interleave reasoning and decision-making to handle novel situations with minimal supervision?

The significance of this research lies in its potential to bridge the gap between symbolic reasoning and subsymbolic learning, creating agents that combine the generalization capabilities of LLMs with the adaptive decision-making of RL. By enabling knowledge transfer across tasks and reducing reliance on explicit human guidance, the proposed framework could advance autonomous systems across numerous domains, from robotics and game AI to workflow automation and assistive technologies. Furthermore, it contributes to our understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of integrated reasoning and decision-making systems, potentially informing cognitive science models of human problem-solving.

## 2. Methodology

The Dynamic Knowledge Integration Framework (DKIF) consists of three primary components: (1) a language-based reasoning module powered by a large language model, (2) a reinforcement learning-based decision-making module, and (3) a dynamic knowledge repository that facilitates bidirectional information flow between the two modules. This section details the architecture, training process, and evaluation methodology for the proposed framework.

### 2.1 System Architecture

#### 2.1.1 Language-Based Reasoning Module (LRM)

The LRM utilizes a large language model to perform high-level reasoning, planning, and task decomposition. The module takes as input:
- Environmental observations (textual descriptions or structured representations)
- Task descriptions
- The current state of the knowledge repository

The LRM outputs:
- Abstract plans with hierarchical subgoals
- Reasoning traces explaining the planning process
- Queries to the knowledge repository
- Updates to the knowledge repository based on reasoning

Formally, the LRM function can be represented as:

$$\text{LRM}(O_t, T, K_t) \rightarrow (P_t, R_t, Q_t, \Delta K_t^{LRM})$$

Where:
- $O_t$ represents observations at time $t$
- $T$ represents the task description
- $K_t$ represents the knowledge repository at time $t$
- $P_t$ represents the generated plan with subgoals
- $R_t$ represents reasoning traces
- $Q_t$ represents knowledge queries
- $\Delta K_t^{LRM}$ represents knowledge updates from reasoning

#### 2.1.2 Reinforcement Learning Decision-Making Module (RDM)

The RDM implements a reinforcement learning agent that translates high-level plans into concrete actions and learns from environmental feedback. The module consists of:
- A policy network $\pi_\theta(a|s,g)$ that maps states $s$ and subgoals $g$ to action probabilities
- A value network $V_\phi(s,g)$ that estimates expected returns
- An intrinsic motivation component that rewards exploration and plan adherence

The RDM takes as input:
- Environmental state representations
- Subgoals from the LRM
- The current state of the knowledge repository

The RDM outputs:
- Actions to be executed in the environment
- Experience tuples for policy updating
- Updates to the knowledge repository based on experiences

Formally, the RDM function can be represented as:

$$\text{RDM}(S_t, G_t, K_t) \rightarrow (A_t, E_t, \Delta K_t^{RDM})$$

Where:
- $S_t$ represents the state at time $t$
- $G_t$ represents the current subgoal
- $K_t$ represents the knowledge repository
- $A_t$ represents the selected action
- $E_t$ represents experience tuples $(S_t, A_t, R_t, S_{t+1})$
- $\Delta K_t^{RDM}$ represents knowledge updates from experiences

#### 2.1.3 Dynamic Knowledge Repository (DKR)

The DKR serves as the bridge between reasoning and decision-making, storing and organizing knowledge in a format accessible to both modules. The repository contains:
- Declarative knowledge (facts, rules, concepts)
- Procedural knowledge (action sequences, skills)
- Episodic knowledge (past experiences)
- Meta-knowledge (learning strategies, self-assessment)

The knowledge is represented using a hybrid structure combining:
- Symbolic representations (triplets, rules)
- Distributed representations (embeddings)
- Temporal sequences (episodic traces)

The DKR provides the following functions:
- Knowledge retrieval: $\text{Retrieve}(Q_t, K_t) \rightarrow I_t$
- Knowledge integration: $K_{t+1} = \text{Integrate}(K_t, \Delta K_t^{LRM}, \Delta K_t^{RDM})$
- Knowledge consolidation: $K_t' = \text{Consolidate}(K_t)$

### 2.2 Training Methodology

The training process consists of three main phases: pretraining, joint training, and continuous learning.

#### 2.2.1 Pretraining Phase

**LRM Pretraining:**
1. Fine-tune a large language model on a dataset combining:
   - Task descriptions paired with hierarchical plans
   - Commonsense reasoning datasets
   - Domain-specific knowledge bases
2. Train the model to generate reasoning traces alongside plans
3. Implement Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought prompting to enhance reasoning capabilities

**RDM Pretraining:**
1. Train RL policies using standard algorithms (PPO, SAC) in simulated environments
2. Implement curriculum learning by gradually increasing task complexity
3. Use self-play and environmental diversity to improve generalization
4. Pre-populate the knowledge repository with initial domain knowledge

#### 2.2.2 Joint Training Phase

The joint training phase aligns the LRM and RDM through a contrastive learning approach:

1. **Alignment Training:**
   For each task $T$:
   - Generate plans $P$ and subgoals $G$ using the LRM
   - Execute subgoals using the RDM and collect experiences
   - Compute alignment loss:
     $$\mathcal{L}_{align} = -\mathbb{E}_{G,S}[\log\frac{\exp(f(G) \cdot h(S))/\tau}{\sum_{G'}\exp(f(G') \cdot h(S))/\tau}]$$
     where $f$ and $h$ are embedding functions for subgoals and states, and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter

2. **Policy Optimization:**
   Update the RDM policy using PPO with a composite reward function:
   $$R(s_t, a_t, g_t) = R_{ext}(s_t, a_t) + \lambda_1 R_{plan}(s_t, a_t, g_t) + \lambda_2 R_{int}(s_t, a_t)$$
   where:
   - $R_{ext}$ is the external environment reward
   - $R_{plan}$ measures progress toward subgoal completion
   - $R_{int}$ is an intrinsic motivation reward for exploration
   - $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are weighting coefficients

3. **Knowledge Repository Updates:**
   After each episode:
   - Extract successful action sequences and their contexts
   - Update the knowledge repository with new experiences
   - Perform knowledge consolidation to identify patterns and abstractions
   - Use successful experiences to refine LRM planning capabilities

#### 2.2.3 Continuous Learning Phase

The continuous learning phase enables the agent to adapt to new tasks and environments:

1. **Online Knowledge Acquisition:**
   - Implement an active learning approach where the agent identifies knowledge gaps
   - Prioritize exploration in areas with high uncertainty
   - Update the knowledge repository with new findings

2. **Plan Revision:**
   - Monitor plan execution and detect deviations
   - Trigger replanning when substantial deviations occur
   - Update the LRM based on plan execution outcomes

3. **Knowledge Transfer:**
   - Identify similarities between new tasks and previous experiences
   - Use abstraction to generalize knowledge across related domains
   - Implement a meta-learning approach to improve learning efficiency
