## 1. Title: Dynamic Knowledge-Driven Integration of Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning for Open-World Agents

## 2. Introduction

**2.1 Background**
Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated remarkable success in specialized tasks, often exceeding human capabilities within constrained environments [6]. However, the real world presents a fundamentally different challenge: it is open-ended, dynamic, infinitely diverse in tasks, and demands continuous adaptation and learning. As highlighted by the Workshop on Open-World Agents, the next frontier for AI lies in creating agents that can thrive in such open-world environments. These agents must possess sophisticated cognitive abilities, particularly the seamless integration of high-level reasoning (e.g., planning, abstract thinking, understanding context) and low-level decision-making (e.g., reacting to immediate stimuli, executing motor control). Current AI paradigms often treat reasoning and decision-making as separate processes, leading to systems that are either brittle planners unable to cope with unexpected environmental changes or reactive agents lacking long-term foresight and generalization capabilities. This separation hinders the development of truly autonomous agents capable of navigating the complexities of the open world.

**2.2 Problem Statement**
The core challenge lies in bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning, often embodied by Large Language Models (LLMs), and dynamic decision-making, typically addressed by Reinforcement Learning (RL). LLMs excel at leveraging vast prior knowledge for abstract reasoning and planning [3] but often struggle with grounding these plans in physical or interactive environments and adapting to real-time feedback. Conversely, RL agents learn effective control policies through interaction but often suffer from poor sample efficiency, limited generalization to unseen situations, and difficulty with long-horizon tasks requiring complex reasoning [1, 2]. Attempts to combine these approaches face significant hurdles:

1.  **Integration Complexity:** Designing architectures that allow fluid, bidirectional communication and mutual influence between reasoning and decision-making components is non-trivial [Key Challenge 1].
2.  **Generalization Bottleneck:** Ensuring agents can apply learned knowledge and skills to novel tasks and situations fundamentally different from their training data remains a major obstacle [Key Challenge 2]. Existing methods often require extensive fine-tuning for new domains [3, 4].
3.  **Inefficient Knowledge Management:** Agents need mechanisms to continuously acquire, store, update, and efficiently retrieve relevant knowledge from experience to guide both reasoning and action, facilitating effective knowledge transfer [Key Challenge 3].
4.  **Exploration vs. Reasoning:** Balancing exploration of the environment to discover new information with the exploitation of reasoned plans is crucial, especially in vast open worlds with sparse rewards [Key Challenge 4].
5.  **Supervision Dependency:** Many current approaches rely heavily on curated datasets, human demonstrations, or feedback, limiting scalability and autonomy [Key Challenge 5], although some progress is being made [1, 5].

Addressing these issues is paramount for developing agents that can autonomously operate, learn, and solve problems in the unpredictable open world.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
This research proposes a novel framework, **Dynamic Knowledge-Driven Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning (DKDRL)**, to synergize the strengths of LLMs and RL for open-world agents, explicitly addressing the aforementioned challenges. Our primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Hybrid Architecture:** To design and implement a cohesive system integrating an LLM for high-level reasoning and planning, an RL agent for low-level control and interaction, and a Dynamic Knowledge Repository (DKR) acting as a shared, evolving memory.
2.  **Enable Seamless Interleaving:** To create mechanisms allowing the LLM to generate adaptive, context-aware plans and subgoals that effectively guide the RL agent's exploration and policy execution in real-time.
3.  **Implement Dynamic Knowledge Management:** To develop the DKR module capable of continuously ingesting experiences (observations, actions, outcomes, reasoning traces), structuring this information, and making it accessible to both the LLM (for plan refinement and contextual grounding) and the RL agent (for policy adaptation and knowledge transfer).
4.  **Investigate Representation Alignment:** To explore techniques, specifically contrastive learning, for aligning the semantic representations of LLM-generated subgoals with the state-action representations learned by the RL agent, fostering better mutual understanding and coordination.
5.  **Evaluate Extensively in Open-World Simulations:** To rigorously evaluate the DKDRL agent's capabilities in complex, simulated open-world environments (e.g., Minecraft, robotics simulators) focusing on metrics such as task success rate, generalization to unseen tasks, sample efficiency, adaptation speed, and the ability to perform long-horizon tasks with minimal supervision.

**2.4 Significance**
This research directly addresses the central theme of the Workshop on Open-World Agents: synergizing reasoning and decision-making. By proposing a concrete architecture for unifying LLM-based reasoning and RL-based interaction through a dynamic knowledge core, we aim to provide insights into several key questions posed by the workshop: How can models unify reasoning and decision-making for open-world environments? How does knowledge play a role, and how is it acquired? How can we achieve effective performance with minimal supervision? How can we improve and measure generalization?

Successfully developing the DKDRL framework would represent a significant step towards creating more capable, adaptable, and autonomous AI agents. The potential impact spans multiple domains:

*   **Robotics:** Enabling robots to operate effectively in unstructured and unknown environments, performing complex manipulation or navigation tasks (e.g., disaster response, household assistance).
*   **Game AI:** Creating more believable and adaptive non-player characters (NPCs) capable of complex, long-term behaviors in open-world games.
*   **Autonomous Systems:** Enhancing the capabilities of autonomous vehicles or drones to handle unforeseen circumstances through better planning and adaptation.
*   **Personalized AI Assistants:** Developing assistants that can understand complex user requests involving interaction with digital or physical environments and execute multi-step plans reliably.

Furthermore, this work contributes to the fundamental understanding of how knowledge representation, reasoning, and learning can be integrated within a single agent, potentially offering insights applicable to cognitive science and the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) [6].

## 3. Methodology

Our proposed methodology revolves around the DKDRL framework, detailing its architecture, components, learning mechanisms, and evaluation strategy.

**3.1 Overall Architecture**
The DKDRL framework consists of three core components:
1.  **LLM Reasoner:** A large language model responsible for understanding high-level tasks, leveraging prior knowledge, querying the DKR, and generating structured plans or sequences of subgoals.
2.  **RL Agent:** An reinforcement learning agent responsible for interacting with the environment, executing low-level actions to achieve subgoals provided by the LLM Reasoner, and learning control policies.
3.  **Dynamic Knowledge Repository (DKR):** A structured memory module that stores and continuously updates knowledge derived from both the LLM's reasoning processes and the RL agent's environmental interactions.

The workflow proceeds as follows:
*   A high-level task is provided to the LLM Reasoner.
*   The LLM queries the DKR for relevant prior knowledge (e.g., environmental facts, previously successful strategies) and current world state context (potentially summarized from RL agent's observations).
*   The LLM generates a plan, often decomposed into a sequence of actionable subgoals $\{g_1, g_2, ..., g_N\}$.
*   The current subgoal $g_i$ is passed to the RL Agent.
*   The RL Agent interacts with the environment, taking actions $a_t$ based on its policy $\pi(a_t | s_t, g_i)$ conditioned on the current state $s_t$ and subgoal $g_i$.
*   The environment returns the next state $s_{t+1}$ and reward $r_t$.
*   The RL agent's experiences $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$ and the outcome of attempting subgoal $g_i$ are used to update the RL policy and are logged into the DKR.
*   The DKR processes and integrates this new information.
*   The LLM receives feedback on subgoal achievement (success/failure) and relevant context updates from the DKR, allowing it to dynamically replan or adjust subsequent subgoals ($g_{i+1}, ...$) if necessary. This loop continues until the overall task is completed or deemed impossible.

**3.2 LLM Component (Reasoner)**
*   **Model:** We will leverage a powerful pre-trained foundation model (e.g., LLaMA-3, Mistral-Large, or an open model with strong reasoning capabilities). The choice will depend on API availability, open-source accessibility, and performance on reasoning benchmarks.
*   **Pre-training/Fine-tuning:** The base LLM will possess general knowledge. We may perform lightweight fine-tuning on datasets containing instructional text, task decomposition examples, commonsense reasoning related to physical interaction, and potentially simulated dialogues reflecting planning processes, similar to approaches in [3, 4].
*   **Function:** The LLM functions as a high-level planner. Using techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting or structured planning frameworks (e.g., generating PDDL-like plans or Pythonic function call sequences representing subgoals), it decomposes the main task into manageable subgoals. It interacts with the DKR via structured queries (e.g., "What objects are typically found in a kitchen?", "What was the result of attempting 'open_door_A' previously?"). Its output will be formatted as specific, actionable subgoals understandable by the RL agent's policy.

**3.3 RL Component (Decision-Maker)**
*   **Algorithm:** We will primarily use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [Schulman et al., 2017], potentially incorporating improvements like those presented in LOOP [1] for data efficiency, due to its stability and effectiveness in complex environments. For continuous control tasks in robotics, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [Haarnoja et al., 2018] might be employed. The PPO objective function is generally given by:
    $$L^{CLIP+VF+S}(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t [L_t^{CLIP}(\theta) - c_1 L_t^{VF}(\theta) + c_2 S[\pi_\theta](s_t)]$$
    where $L_t^{CLIP}(\theta) = \min(r_t(\theta)\hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)\hat{A}_t)$ is the clipped surrogate objective, $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}$, $\hat{A}_t$ is the advantage estimate, $L_t^{VF}$ is the value function loss, and $S$ is an entropy bonus.
*   **State/Action Space:** This will be environment-specific. For Minecraft, the state $s_t$ could include visual input (first-person view), inventory status, and potentially recent dialogue history or DKR context summaries. Actions $a_t$ would be discrete game commands (move, jump, mine, place, craft). For robotics, the state might include joint angles, camera images, and tactile sensor readings, while actions could be joint torques or target end-effector poses.
*   **Reward Function:** We will primarily use sparse rewards $R_{ext}$ based on final task completion to encourage goal-directed behavior. To mitigate sparsity, we will incorporate intermediate rewards based on the successful achievement of LLM-generated subgoals $g_i$. Let $I(g_i)$ be an indicator function that is 1 if subgoal $g_i$ is achieved. The total reward can be structured as $R = R_{ext} + \sum_i w_i I(g_i)$, where $w_i$ are weights. We may also explore intrinsic motivation techniques (e.g., curiosity based on prediction error) to encourage exploration, especially in the early stages of learning: $R_{total} = \gamma_{ext}R_{ext} + \gamma_{subgoal}R_{subgoal} + \gamma_{int}R_{int}$.
*   **Training:** Training will occur within the chosen simulation environment via interaction. We will employ distributed training setups where feasible to accelerate learning.

**3.4 Dynamic Knowledge Repository (DKR)**
*   **Structure:** The DKR will be a hybrid system combining:
    *   A vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone) storing embeddings of states, observations, subgoal descriptions, and textual summaries of experiences. This allows for efficient similarity-based retrieval.
    *   A graph database or relational database storing structured knowledge: learned environmental dynamics (e.g., object properties, causal relationships like "mining_wood -> yields_log"), successful/failed action sequences for specific subgoals, task decomposition hierarchies, and semantic maps of explored areas.
*   **Update Mechanism:** The DKR is updated continuously. Successful RL trajectories $(s, a, r, s')$ are processed: embeddings are generated and stored, and structured information (e.g., state transitions, achieved subgoals) is extracted and integrated. Feedback from the LLM (e.g., revised plans based on failed attempts) is also incorporated to refine stored strategies or world models. Techniques like Reservoir Sampling might be used to manage memory size.
*   **Role:** The DKR mediates the LLM-RL interaction. The LLM queries the DKR to ground its reasoning in the agent's actual experience and the learned world model. The RL agent can leverage DKR information, for instance, by incorporating retrieved knowledge into its value function estimation or using it to shape exploration (e.g., prioritizing actions known to be useful for the current subgoal). This facilitates knowledge transfer, as experiences from one task stored in the DKR can inform planning and policy learning for subsequent, related tasks.

**3.5 Integration and Alignment**
*   **LLM-RL Communication:** Subgoals generated by the LLM (e.g., "acquire wooden planks") need to be translated into a form usable by the RL policy. This could involve mapping the natural language subgoal to a specific target state representation or defining a subgoal-specific reward function for the RL agent.
*   **Contrastive Alignment:** To enhance the synergy between the LLM's semantic understanding and the RL agent's grounded representations, we will implement a contrastive learning objective. Let $z_{LLM}$ be the embedding of an LLM-generated subgoal description, $z_{RL}^+$ be the embedding of an RL state representation where that subgoal is considered achieved, and $\{z_{RL, k}^-\}_{k=1}^N$ be embeddings of states where the subgoal is not achieved (negative samples). We use the InfoNCE loss:
    $$L_{CL} = -\mathbb{E}[\log \frac{\exp(sim(z_{LLM}, z_{RL}^+) / \tau)}{ \exp(sim(z_{LLM}, z_{RL}^+) / \tau) + \sum_{k=1}^{N} \exp(sim(z_{LLM}, z_{RL,k}^-) / \tau)}]$$
    Where $sim(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity) and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter. This loss encourages the LLM's subgoal embeddings and the RL agent's corresponding state embeddings to be close in the shared embedding space, improving the RL agent's ability to interpret LLM guidance and potentially allowing the LLM to better anticipate the RL agent's capabilities based on state representations.

**3.6 Data Collection**
*   **Environments:** We will use established open-world simulation platforms:
    *   **Minecraft (using MineDojo or Malmo):** Offers vastness, diverse tasks (crafting, building, exploration, survival), and complex interactions. Ideal for testing long-horizon planning and generalization.
    *   **Robotics Simulator (e.g., Habitat, Isaac Gym, or Gibson):** Provides realistic physics and sensory input (visual, depth, potentially tactile) for tasks like object manipulation, navigation in novel environments, and tool use.
    *   *(Optional)* **Web Environment (e.g., WebArena, AppWorld [1]):** To test reasoning and decision-making in digital interactive environments, aligning with work like WebRL [4].
*   **Logging:** We will log comprehensive data during training and evaluation, including LLM inputs/outputs (prompts, plans, queries), RL trajectories (states, actions, rewards), DKR contents over time, and metrics for subgoal/task success.

**3.7 Experimental Design**
*   **Baselines:** We will compare DKDRL against:
    *   **Pure RL:** Standard PPO/SAC agent trained with sparse task rewards.
    *   **LLM+Prompting:** An LLM agent using advanced prompting techniques (e.g., ReAct, Plan-and-Solve) to directly generate low-level action sequences, without a dedicated RL component or dynamic memory.
    *   **Fixed LLM Guidance:** An LLM provides an initial plan, but the RL agent executes it without ongoing LLM adaptation or a sophisticated DKR (similar to simpler hierarchical RL schemes).
    *   **Ablated DKDRL:** Versions of our model without the DKR or without the contrastive alignment loss to assess the contribution of each component.
    *   *(Optional)* Implementations based on related work like [1, 2, 3] for direct comparison if feasible.
*   **Evaluation Tasks:**
    *   **Training Tasks:** A set of diverse tasks used for initial training (e.g., in Minecraft: craft a wooden pickaxe, build a small shelter, find iron ore).
    *   **Generalization Tasks (Zero-Shot):**
        *   *Novel Goal:* Perform a known skill for a new target (e.g., craft a stone pickaxe after learning wooden).
        *   *Novel Environment:* Execute a known task in an unfamiliar area or configuration.
        *   *Novel Object Interaction:* Interact with objects not seen during training.
    *   **Compositional Tasks:** Combine multiple learned skills sequentially to achieve a complex goal not explicitly trained for (e.g., mine coal, craft torches, explore a dark cave).
    *   **Long-Horizon Tasks:** Tasks requiring extended sequences of coherent actions and potentially dynamic replanning.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Primary:** Task Success Rate, Sample Efficiency (episodes/steps to convergence or target success rate).
    *   **Generalization:** Zero-shot success rate on unseen tasks, performance drop compared to training tasks.
    *   **Efficiency:** Planning time (LLM inference), decision time (RL policy forward pass), training wall-clock time.
    *   **Adaptation:** Speed of recovery/replanning after encountering unexpected environmental changes or plan failures.
    *   **Knowledge Transfer:** Performance on a new task B after training on a related task A, compared to training on B from scratch.
    *   **Ablation Study:** Quantify the performance impact of removing the DKR or the contrastive alignment mechanism.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**
We anticipate that the DKDRL framework will yield the following key outcomes:

1.  **Enhanced Generalization:** The combination of LLM's abstract reasoning, RL's adaptive control, and the DKR's continuously updated knowledge base is expected to significantly improve the agent's ability to generalize to unseen tasks, objects, and environmental configurations compared to baseline methods. The DKR will facilitate transfer of relevant past experiences, while the LLM provides high-level strategies adaptable to novelty.
2.  **Improved Sample Efficiency:** By leveraging the LLM's prior knowledge for planning and guidance, and by reusing learned knowledge stored in the DKR, we expect the RL agent to require substantially fewer environment interactions to learn effective policies for complex tasks, particularly those with sparse rewards, compared to pure RL approaches.
3.  **Effective Long-Horizon Task Completion:** The hierarchical approach, where the LLM sets high-level subgoals and the RL agent executes them, combined with the ability to dynamically replan based on feedback stored in the DKR, should enable the agent to successfully tackle complex, long-horizon tasks that challenge traditional RL or LLM-only methods.
4.  **Demonstrable Knowledge Acquisition and Reuse:** We expect to show quantitatively, through analysis of the DKR and comparative experiments, that the agent effectively acquires new knowledge about the environment and its own capabilities through interaction, and successfully reuses this knowledge to accelerate learning and improve performance on subsequent tasks.
5.  **Validation of Integration Mechanisms:** The experiments, including ablation studies, will provide evidence for the effectiveness of the DKR as a mediating knowledge hub and the contrastive alignment technique in improving the synergy between the LLM and RL components. We expect to observe emergent complex behaviors arising naturally from this integration.

**4.2 Impact**
This research holds significant potential for advancing the field of AI and addressing critical challenges in creating autonomous open-world agents:

*   **Contribution to Workshop Goals:** Our work directly engages with the central themes of the Workshop on Open-World Agents by proposing a unified model for reasoning and decision-making, exploring the role of dynamic knowledge acquisition, aiming to reduce supervision dependency, and providing a framework for evaluating generalization in complex environments. We aim to offer concrete answers and methodologies related to the workshop's key scientific questions.
*   **Scientific Advancement:** This project will contribute a novel, principled architecture for integrating symbolic reasoning (LLMs) and sub-symbolic learning (RL) through a dynamic knowledge interface. Success would provide strong evidence for the viability of such hybrid approaches and offer insights into building more generally capable AI systems. It pushes the boundaries beyond static knowledge bases or simple hierarchical control.
*   **Practical Applications:** The DKDRL framework, if successful, could pave the way for more robust and versatile AI applications. In robotics, it could lead to robots capable of autonomously operating in homes, factories, or disaster zones. In gaming, it could enable truly interactive and emergent NPC behaviors. For digital agents [1, 4], it could mean more capable systems for complex web navigation or workflow automation. Personalized assistants could handle more sophisticated, multi-step real-world tasks.
*   **Economic Implications:** By potentially reducing the need for massive datasets and extensive human supervision [5], approaches like DKDRL could make the development of highly capable AI more accessible and cost-effective.
*   **Future Research Directions:** This work will open avenues for future research, including scaling the DKR, extending the framework to multi-agent systems, incorporating more sophisticated reasoning mechanisms within the LLM (e.g., causal inference), handling partial observability more explicitly, ensuring safety and ethical alignment in open-world exploration, and developing theoretical understandings of the interplay between knowledge, reasoning, and reinforcement learning in lifelong adaptation scenarios.

In summary, the proposed research on the DKDRL framework aims to make substantial contributions to the development of open-world AI agents by effectively synergizing reasoning and decision-making through a dynamic, knowledge-driven approach, with significant potential for both scientific understanding and practical application.
