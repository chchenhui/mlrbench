# Dynamic Knowledge-Driven Integration of Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning for Open-World Agents

## Introduction

### Background
Open-world environments represent the next frontier for AI agents, demanding capabilities that extend far beyond isolated task execution. Unlike static environments with fixed objectives, open-world scenarios require agents to continually adapt to novel tasks, integrate symbolic reasoning with dynamic decision-making, and acquire knowledge through interaction. Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for abstract reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) for sequential decision-making, most systems treat these functions in isolation. This gap limits their ability to generalize across infinite task permutations and environmental shifts, as evidenced by the persistent challenges in robotics, game AI, and autonomous systems [Chen et al., 2025; Qi et al., 2024].

### Research Objectives
This proposal addresses the following objectives:
1. **Architectural Innovation**: Develop a hybrid framework that integrates LLM-based symbolic reasoning with RL-driven decision-making via a dynamic knowledge repository.
2. **Knowledge Evolution Mechanism**: Design a contrastive learning approach to align LLM-generated subgoals with RL-learned state representations, enabling mutual refinement of reasoning and policy execution.
3. **Open-World Validation**: Evaluate the framework in environments with sparse rewards and infinite task diversity (e.g., Minecraft, AppWorld) to measure generalization, sample efficiency, and emergent capability formation.

### Significance
This work directly responds to key workshop questions about the synergistic unification of reasoning and decision-making. By addressing challenges in knowledge transfer, exploration-exploitation balance, and minimal supervision, it aims to:
- Reduce reliance on human-labeled curricula [WebRL, 2024].
- Enable autonomous adaptation to unseen scenarios through learned knowledge composition [LLaMA-Rider, 2023].
- Advance theoretical understanding of hybrid cognitive architectures for open-world agents.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Environment Design
The framework will be evaluated in two complementary environments:
1. **AppWorld**: A stateful, multi-domain environment simulating web workflows (code editing, file management).
2. **Minecraft**: A sandbox world with combinatorial object interactions and spatial reasoning requirements.

Data collection involves:
- **LLM Pretraining**: Curate a corpus of structured tasks, commonsense knowledge (e.g., ConceptNet), and procedural documentation to initialize the symbolic reasoning module.
- **Synthetic Task Generation**: Automatically create infinite task permutations (e.g., "Build a red house using only sandstone, avoiding water sources") to stress-test generalization.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Initialization**: A small dataset of expert demonstrations to bootstrap RL policy training [Feng et al., 2023].

### Algorithmic Architecture

#### 1. Hybrid Reasoning-Planning-Execution Framework
The architecture comprises three core components (Figure 1):

**A. Symbolic Reasoning Module (LLM)**  
- **Architecture**: Fine-tuned LLaMA-3 65B with instruction alignment.  
- **Function**:  
  - Maps task specifications to hierarchical subgoals (e.g., "Build a house" → "Collect resources" → "Mine stone" → "Craft tools").  
  - Incorporates contextual knowledge (e.g., material properties in Minecraft).  
  - Generates counterfactual reasoning during failures ("Why did the bridge collapse?").

**B. Reinforcement Learning Agent (Execution Layer)**  
- **Architecture**: PPO with GNN-based state encoders for object-centric representations.  
- **Policy**:  
  - Learns low-level actions (e.g., move, place, attack) via self-play.  
  - Receives subgoals $g_t \in \mathcal{G}$ from the LLM as temporally extended options.  
  - Maximizes cumulative reward $R(s_t, a_t, g_t)$ through Bellman updates:  
  $$  
  Q(s_t, a_t, g_t) \leftarrow \mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1}} \left[ r(s_t, a_t, g_t) + \gamma \max_{a_{t+1}} Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}, g_t) \right]  
  $$  

**C. Dynamic Knowledge Repository**  
A memory module with three components:
1. **Episodic Buffer**: Stores trajectories $(s_t, a_t, r_t, g_t)$ as tuples.
2. **Semantic Graph**: Updates a knowledge graph $\mathcal{K} = (\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{R})$ with entities $\mathcal{E}$ and relations $\mathcal{R}$ learned from LLM and RL interactions.
3. **Contrastive Aligner**: Minimizes the distance between LLM subgoal embeddings $z^{\text{LLM}}$ and RL state encodings $z^{\text{RL}}$ via InfoNCE loss:  
  $$  
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{align}} = -\log \frac{\exp(z^{\text{LLM}} \cdot z^{\text{RL}} / \tau)}{\sum_{z^-} \exp(z^{\text{LLM}} \cdot z^- / \tau)}  
  $$  
  where $\tau$ is a temperature parameter and $z^-$ are negative samples.

#### 2. Interaction Protocol
1. The LLM generates a subgoal sequence $\{g_1, \dots, g_T\}$ from the high-level task.  
2. The RL agent executes each subgoal until termination criteria are met.  
3. Failed subgoals trigger:  
   - LLM reasoning over the failure causes using $\mathcal{K}$.  
   - RL policy refinement via online fine-tuning.  
4. The dynamic repository updates $\mathcal{K}$ with successful trajectories.  

#### 3. Training Pipeline
- **Stage 1**: Pretrain LLM on structured tasks; train RL policy on simple tasks with dense rewards.  
- **Stage 2**: Joint optimization with alternating updates:  
  - LLM queries $\mathcal{K}$ for task-relevant knowledge.  
  - RL agent optimizes $Q$-function with $\mathcal{L}_{\text{align}}$ regularization.  
  - Repository updates every $k$ episodes.

### Experimental Design

#### Baselines
- **Pure LLM (Zero-Shot)**: GPT-4 with no environment interaction.  
- **Pure RL (PPO)**: Standard policy training without reasoning.  
- **LOLA-RL**: Modular architecture with static knowledge [Chen et al., 2025].  
- **WebRL**: Self-evolving curriculum baseline [Qi et al., 2024].  

#### Metrics
1. **Task Success Rate (TSR)**: Percentage of tasks completed within episode budget.  
2. **Sample Efficiency**: Episodes needed to reach 90% TSR.  
3. **Generalization Index**: TSR on unseen tasks vs. training tasks.  
4. **Emergent Complexity Score**: Count of multi-step tasks solved without explicit programming.  

#### Ablation Studies
1. Impact of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{align}}$ on subgoal alignment.  
2. Knowledge graph sparsity vs. retrieval accuracy.  
3. Trade-offs between episodic and semantic memory.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Technical Contributions
1. **Dynamic Knowledge Framework**: A novel architecture enabling bidirectional refinement between symbolic reasoning and low-level execution.  
2. **Scalable Generalization**: Demonstration of >70% TSR on unseen Minecraft tasks, outperforming WebRL [2024] by 20% in sample efficiency.  
3. **Emergent Capabilities**: Autonomous execution of 5+ step tasks (e.g., "Create a wheat farm with automated harvesting") without hierarchical programming.  

### Theoretical Impact
- **Unification Theory**: Empirical evidence for synergies between model-based reasoning and model-free RL in open worlds.  
- **Knowledge Transfer Mechanisms**: Framework for quantifying abstraction hierarchies in hybrid architectures.  

### Practical Applications
- **Robotics**: Disaster response agents that combine object reasoning with locomotion.  
- **Digital Assistants**: LLMs with self-supervised skill acquisition for workflow automation.  
- **Game AI**: NPCs that adaptively generate goals and execute plans in evolving worlds.  

### Societal Impact
This work aligns with efforts to reduce AI development costs by minimizing human feedback [DeepSeek, 2025]. By enabling systems that learn autonomously from environmental interaction, it addresses ethical challenges in scaling AI deployment while advancing progress toward general-purpose agents.
