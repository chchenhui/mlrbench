1. **Title**: **Dynamic Knowledge-Driven Integration of Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning for Open-World Agents**  
2. **Motivation**:  
   Open-world environments demand agents that seamlessly interleave reasoning (e.g., planning, abstraction) and decision-making (e.g., real-time control), yet most systems treat these in isolation. Existing approaches struggle with adapting to unseen tasks, inefficient knowledge transfer, and balancing exploration with reasoning-driven planning. Unifying these capabilities could enable agents to generalize across infinite tasks while minimizing human supervision, addressing critical gaps in robotics, game AI, and autonomous systems.  

3. **Main Idea**:  
   Propose a hybrid architecture combining **large language models (LLMs)** for symbolic reasoning with **reinforcement learning (RL)** for dynamic decision-making, unified via a shared, evolving knowledge repository. The LLM component generates high-level plans using prior knowledge and contextual reasoning, while the RL agent executes low-level actions, adapting to environmental feedback. A dynamic memory module continuously updates the repository with new experiences, enabling the LLM to refine future reasoning and the RL agent to transfer knowledge across tasks. Methodology includes:  
   - Pretraining the LLM on diverse task descriptions and commonsense knowledge.  
   - Training RL policies via self-play in simulated open-world environments (e.g., Minecraft, robotics simulators) with sparse rewards.  
   - Using contrastive learning to align LLM-generated subgoals with RL-learned state representations.  
   Expected outcomes: Improved generalization in unseen scenarios (e.g., novel object interactions), reduced sample complexity via knowledge reuse, and emergent multi-step task completion without explicit programming. This framework could advance autonomous agents in domains requiring both creativity and precision, such as disaster response robotics or personalized AI assistants.
