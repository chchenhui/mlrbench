# TempoRank: Enhancing Recommender Systems with Temporal Graph Learning

## Motivation
Traditional recommender systems often fail to capture the dynamic nature of user preferences and item popularity over time, leading to outdated or irrelevant recommendations. While static graph-based approaches have improved recommendation quality by modeling user-item interactions as graphs, they neglect the temporal evolution of these interactions. This research addresses this limitation by introducing a temporal graph learning framework specifically designed for recommendation systems that captures how user preferences shift over time, seasonal trends in item popularity, and the emergence of new items or changing user interests.

## Main Idea
TempoRank proposes a dynamic graph attention mechanism that incorporates temporal embeddings alongside structural graph properties. The framework consists of three key components: (1) a temporal encoding layer that transforms timestamps into continuous representations, capturing periodicity and recency effects; (2) a dynamic graph construction module that maintains efficient sliding windows of user-item interactions with varying importance weights based on recency; and (3) a temporal-aware message passing neural network that propagates information through the graph while preserving temporal consistency. Our method explicitly models how influence flows through the recommendation graph over time, allowing for better cold-start recommendations and trend prediction. The framework can detect emerging interest shifts before they become mainstream, providing timely and personalized recommendations that adapt to changing user behaviors in e-commerce, content streaming, and social media platforms.
