**Title:** Hyperbolic Temporal Graph Networks for Evolving Hierarchical Structures  

**Motivation:** Many real-world networks exhibit both hierarchical organization and dynamic evolution over time (e.g., social networks, citation graphs). While hyperbolic geometry effectively captures hierarchical relationships in static graphs, existing methods fail to model their temporal dynamics. This gap limits the ability to analyze and predict phenomena like community evolution or information cascades in time-sensitive applications such as biology, finance, and social science. Addressing this challenge could improve temporal link prediction, anomaly detection, and forecasting in complex systems.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a **Hyperbolic Temporal Graph Network (HTGN)** that jointly learns hierarchical structures and temporal dynamics using Riemannian geometry. The model will: (1) Encode nodes into hyperbolic space using a time-aware embedding module that adapts to structural changes via continuous-time dynamics, and (2) Integrate temporal message-passing to propagate information across evolving edges while preserving geodesic distances. Methodology includes designing Riemannian recurrent units and curvature learning schedules to dynamically adjust hyperbolic metrics. Experiments will benchmark against datasets like dynamic citation graphs and social networks, targeting link forecasting and community detection. Expected outcomes include improved accuracy in temporal prediction tasks and interpretable visualizations of hierarchical evolution. This approach could enable applications like detecting financial fraud through anomalous hierarchy shifts or modeling protein interaction evolution in biology.
