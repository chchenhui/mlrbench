### Title: Temporal Graph Anomaly Detection Using Autoencoders and Graph Convolutional Networks

### Motivation
Anomaly detection in temporal graphs is crucial for identifying fraudulent activities, detecting misinformation, and ensuring network security. Existing methods often struggle with the dynamic nature of temporal graphs, making it challenging to capture temporal dependencies and structural changes effectively. This research aims to address these challenges by integrating autoencoders and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to enhance the detection of anomalies in evolving graphs.

### Main Idea
The proposed research will develop a hybrid model that leverages the temporal modeling capabilities of autoencoders and the structural learning strengths of GCNs. The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Convert temporal graph data into a sequence of static graphs, where each graph represents the state of the network at a specific time step.
2. **Temporal Graph Embedding**: Use a GCN-based encoder to capture the structural and temporal features of each graph in the sequence.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Train an autoencoder to reconstruct the temporal graph embeddings. The reconstruction error serves as an anomaly score, indicating potential anomalies in the network.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train the hybrid model using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score on benchmark datasets.

The expected outcomes include a robust anomaly detection framework capable of handling dynamic networks and a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method against existing state-of-the-art techniques. The potential impact is significant, as it can enhance the reliability and efficiency of anomaly detection systems in various applications, including cybersecurity, fraud detection, and network monitoring.
