**1. Title:** **AutoQC: A Self-Supervised Dual-Network AI for Automated Quality Control and Curation of Molecular Datasets in Life and Material Sciences**

---

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
The fields of biology and chemistry are foundational to human well-being, driving advancements in medicine, materials science, and agriculture. As we face mounting global challenges like climate change, pandemics, and resource scarcity, the need to accelerate the discovery and development cycle in these domains has become paramount. Machine learning (ML) offers transformative potential, promising to expedite hypothesis generation, predict molecular properties, design novel compounds, and optimize experimental processes. However, the translation of ML from theoretical potential to robust industrial applications in life and material sciences lags behind other domains like computer vision and natural language processing.

A significant bottleneck hindering this translation is the quality and reliability of the underlying data [(Workshop Overview)]. Molecular datasets, encompassing diverse representations from small molecule graphs and protein structures to high-throughput screening results and crystal geometries, are often plagued by experimental errors, inconsistencies across measurement techniques, missing values, inherent biases, and annotation inaccuracies. Compiling large-scale, high-quality datasets requires meticulous curation, which is currently dominated by manual or semi-automated processes. These methods are not only labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive but also subjective and struggle to scale with the exponential growth of data generation. Poor data quality directly impacts the reliability, reproducibility, and generalizability of ML models trained on them, often leading to promising results on benchmark datasets that fail to translate into real-world utility [(Key Challenge 1)]. This compromises the trustworthiness of ML-driven discovery and hinders its industrial adoption.

Recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) have shown significant promise for learning meaningful representations from large unlabeled molecular datasets [(1, 2, 3, 4)]. Methods like MoCL [(3)] and GROVER [(4)] leverage contrastive learning or graph transformers to capture intricate structural and chemical information without explicit labels. However, even these powerful SSL techniques are susceptible to noise and inconsistencies present in the training data. As highlighted by MOLGRAPHEVAL [(2)], robust evaluation methodologies are crucial, and these evaluations implicitly depend on the quality of the benchmark data itself [(Key Challenge 4)]. Furthermore, effectively integrating domain-specific physical and chemical principles remains a key challenge [(Key Challenge 5)] but is essential for building truly robust and interpretable models.

**2.2 Research Gap and Proposed Idea**
While existing research focuses heavily on developing sophisticated ML models for prediction tasks (e.g., property prediction, binding affinity), the critical upstream step of ensuring data quality at scale remains largely unaddressed by advanced ML techniques. Current curation relies on rule-based filters or manual inspection, which are insufficient for detecting complex, non-obvious errors or subtle biases. There is a critical need for automated, intelligent systems that can rigorously assess and enhance the quality of molecular datasets.

To bridge this gap, we propose **AutoQC**, a novel self-supervised AI system designed for the dual purpose of **automated quality control and curation** of molecular datasets. AutoQC employs a dual-network architecture inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): a **Curator Network** tasked with identifying potential errors, inconsistencies, or anomalies within molecular data and proposing corrections, and an **Adversary Network** trained to distinguish between high-quality reference data and the data processed (potentially corrected) by the Curator. By training this system in a self-supervised manner on large datasets containing synthetically introduced, realistic errors derived from known experimental artifacts and inconsistencies, AutoQC learns to recognize complex patterns indicative of poor data quality. Crucially, the framework explicitly integrates domain knowledge through physics-based constraints (e.g., valid geometries, energy potentials) and chemical feasibility rules (e.g., valence, bond types) directly into the learning process.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:
1.  **Develop the AutoQC Framework:** Design, implement, and train the dual-network (Curator-Adversary) architecture for simultaneous data curation and quality assessment across diverse molecular representations (e.g., small molecule graphs, protein structures).
2.  **Integrate Domain Knowledge:** Systematically incorporate physics-based and chemical feasibility constraints into the AutoQC learning process to ensure chemically and physically plausible outputs and improve error detection sensitivity.
3.  **Validate Curation Performance:** Quantitatively evaluate AutoQC's ability to identify and correct various types of known/synthetic errors and inconsistencies in benchmark molecular datasets, comparing its performance against baseline methods and manual curation standards.
4.  **Assess Impact on Downstream Tasks:** Demonstrate the practical utility of AutoQC by evaluating the performance improvement of standard downstream ML models (e.g., property prediction, virtual screening) when trained on datasets curated by AutoQC versus uncurated or conventionally filtered data.
5.  **Evaluate Transferability:** Assess the capability of the trained AutoQC quality assessment component (the Adversary network) to evaluate the quality of new, unseen molecular datasets, providing a transferable tool for real-time data quality monitoring.

**2.4 Significance**
This research directly addresses the critical need for reliable, scalable, and automated data quality control in life and material science ML, aligning perfectly with the workshop's focus on **dataset curation, analysis, and benchmarking (Topic 1)** and proposing a **novel algorithm unlocking new capabilities (Topic 2)**. By automating and enhancing data curation, AutoQC offers several significant benefits:
*   **Improved Model Reliability:** Curated datasets will lead to more robust, reproducible, and generalizable ML models, increasing trust in their predictions for drug discovery, materials design, and other applications.
*   **Accelerated Discovery Cycles:** Automating the time-consuming curation process frees up researcher time and enables faster iteration cycles from data generation to model deployment.
*   **Enhanced Benchmarking:** Provides a mechanism for creating higher-quality benchmark datasets and offers a tool to assess the quality of existing ones, leading to more meaningful model comparisons.
*   **Bridging Theory and Practice:** Develops an advanced ML technique (self-supervised adversarial learning with domain knowledge) to solve a practical, industry-relevant problem (data quality).
*   **Transferable Quality Assessment:** The trained quality assessment module can serve as a standalone tool for evaluating new data sources, crucial for industrial pipelines integrating disparate data streams.

Successfully developing AutoQC will represent a significant step towards establishing more robust and industrially viable ML workflows in the life and material sciences, facilitating the translation of theoretical advances into tangible societal impact.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework**
The core of AutoQC is a dual-network system trained adversarially in a self-supervised manner.
*   **Curator Network ($C$)**: Takes a potentially noisy or inconsistent molecular representation ($x'$) as input and aims to output a corrected/cleaned representation ($\hat{x}$) along with potential quality flags or anomaly scores for specific parts of the input.
*   **Adversary Network ($D$)**: Acts as a discriminator, trained to distinguish between samples drawn from a high-quality reference dataset ($x \sim P_{hq}$) and samples processed by the Curator ($\hat{x} = C(x')$).

The training paradigm is self-supervised. We start with a large dataset assumed to be of reasonably high quality ($X_{hq}$). We then create corrupted versions ($X'$) by applying a noise function $N$ that simulates realistic errors: $x' = N(x)$ where $x \in X_{hq}$. The Curator $C$ learns to reverse the corruption ($C(x') \approx x$), while the Adversary $D$ learns to identify whether a sample looks like it belongs to the original high-quality distribution $P_{hq}$ or if it's a potentially imperfectly corrected sample from $C$.

**3.2 Data Collection and Preparation**
*   **Data Sources:** We will leverage publicly available, large-scale molecular datasets relevant to life and material sciences. Examples include:
    *   Small Molecules: ChEMBL, PubChem, ZINC databases (represented as SMILES strings initially, then converted to molecular graphs).
    *   Protein Structures: Protein Data Bank (PDB) (represented as point clouds of atomic coordinates, graphs, or sequences).
    *   Crystal Structures: Crystallography Open Database (COD), Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) (represented by lattice parameters, atomic coordinates within the unit cell, and connectivity).
*   **Reference High-Quality Set ($X_{hq}$):** A subset of data from these sources will be carefully selected based on existing quality metrics (e.g., high resolution for PDB structures, experimental provenance, consistency checks) to form the initial reference set $P_{hq}$.
*   **Synthetic Corruption Function ($N$):** This function is critical. It will simulate a diverse range of plausible errors based on known experimental artifacts and data processing issues:
    *   *Noise Injection:* Adding random noise to atomic coordinates (within plausible bounds), perturbing measured properties (e.g., bioactivity values).
    *   *Structural Errors:* Randomly deleting/adding atoms or bonds (while attempting to maintain basic graph connectivity), altering bond types, creating steric clashes.
    *   *Inconsistencies:* Introducing conflicting information, e.g., incompatible stereochemistry labels, discrepancies between 2D graph and 3D conformer representations, mismatches in reported experimental conditions vs. results.
    *   *Missing Data Simulation:* Randomly masking certain features or substructures.
    The design of $N$ will be informed by domain expertise and literature on experimental errors in structural biology, cheminformatics, and materials science data.

**3.3 Model Architecture**
The specific architectures for $C$ and $D$ will depend on the data modality.
*   **Molecular Graphs (Small Molecules, Connectivity):**
    *   *Curator ($C$):* Likely a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture, such as a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), Graph Attention Network (GAT), or a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN), potentially integrated within a sequence-to-sequence framework or transformer architecture similar to GROVER [(4)] if input/output structures can differ significantly. The output layer will predict corrected node/edge features (atom types, bond types) or generate confidence scores for existing features.
    *   *Adversary ($D$):* Can be another GNN followed by a graph pooling layer and a final classification layer outputting a single probability score (real vs. fake/corrected).
*   **Point Clouds (Protein Structures, 3D Conformations):**
    *   *Curator ($C$):* Architectures suitable for point clouds, such as PointNet++, SE(3)-Transformers, or Equivariant GNNs, which respect rotational and translational symmetry. The network would predict refined coordinates or identify anomalous residues/atoms.
    *   *Adversary ($D$):* Similar point cloud processing architecture followed by a classification head.
*   **Crystal Structures:**
    *   *Curator ($C$):* Architectures designed for periodic structures, potentially adapting GNNs to handle periodic boundary conditions or using specialized crystal graph networks. Focus would be on validating lattice parameters, atomic positions, and site occupancies.
    *   *Adversary ($D$):* Corresponding architecture for classification.

**3.4 Integration of Domain Knowledge**
This is a crucial component to guide the curation process towards physically and chemically realistic outputs. Integration will occur via:
*   **Physics-Based Loss Terms:** Penalize corrected structures that violate physical principles. For 3D structures (proteins, conformers), this can include:
    *   *Bond Length/Angle Potentials:* Add a loss term based on deviations from ideal bond lengths and angles (e.g., using harmonic potentials): $L_{bond} = \sum_{bonds} k_l (l - l_0)^2$, $L_{angle} = \sum_{angles} k_\theta (\theta - \theta_0)^2$.
    *   *Van der Waals / Steric Clash Penalty:* Use a repulsive term from a simplified force field (like Lennard-Jones) to penalize unrealistically close non-bonded atoms: $L_{vdw} = \sum_{i<j} (\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}})^{12}$.
*   **Chemical Feasibility Constraints:**
    *   *Valence Checks:* Implement a penalty if the corrected molecular graph implies incorrect valencies for atoms. $L_{valence} = \sum_{atoms} max(0, V_{actual} - V_{allowed})^p$.
    *   *Rule-Based Checks:* Incorporate checks for chemically nonsensical structures (e.g., unstable functional groups, incorrect ring formations) either as hard constraints post-processing or as differentiable penalty terms if possible.
*   **Constraint Incorporation:** These constraints will be added as penalty terms to the Curator's loss function, guiding it to produce outputs that are not only close to the presumed ground truth but also physically and chemically valid.

**3.5 Training Procedure**
The training follows an adversarial scheme:
1.  Sample a batch of high-quality data points $\{x_1, ..., x_m\}$ from $X_{hq}$.
2.  Generate corrupted versions $\{x'_1, ..., x'_m\}$ using the noise function $N$: $x'_i = N(x_i)$.
3.  Pass the corrupted data through the Curator to get corrected versions: $\hat{x}_i = C(x'_i)$.
4.  Train the Adversary $D$:
    *   Maximize its ability to classify real samples ($x_i$) as real (label 1) and corrected samples ($\hat{x}_i$) as fake (label 0). The Adversary loss ($L_D$) is typically the Binary Cross-Entropy loss:
        $$ L_D = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m [\log D(x_i) + \log(1 - D(\hat{x}_i))] $$
5.  Train the Curator $C$:
    *   Minimize a combined loss function ($L_C$) composed of:
        *   *Reconstruction Loss ($L_{rec}$):* Encourages the Curator to reconstruct the original high-quality data point $x_i$ from its corrupted version $x'_i$. The specific form depends on the data type (e.g., Mean Squared Error for coordinates, Cross-Entropy for categorical features like atom types). For instance, for coordinates $r$: $L_{rec} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m ||C(x'_i)_{coords} - x_{i,coords}||^2$.
        *   *Adversarial Loss ($L_{adv}$):* Encourages the Curator to fool the Adversary, making its output $\hat{x}_i$ look like real data. $L_{adv} = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \log D(C(x'_i))$.
        *   *Domain Knowledge Loss ($L_{domain}$):* Incorporates the physics and chemistry penalties described above, calculated on the output $\hat{x}_i$. $L_{domain} = \lambda_{bond} L_{bond} + \lambda_{angle} L_{angle} + \lambda_{vdw} L_{vdw} + \lambda_{valence} L_{valence} + ...$.
    *   The total Curator loss is a weighted sum:
        $$ L_C = \lambda_{rec} L_{rec} + \lambda_{adv} L_{adv} + \lambda_{domain} L_{domain} $$
    *   The weights ($\lambda_{rec}, \lambda_{adv}, \lambda_{domain}$) are hyperparameters controlling the balance between reconstruction fidelity, realism, and physical/chemical validity.

Steps 4 and 5 are iterated using optimization algorithms like Adam or RMSprop.

**3.6 Experimental Design and Validation**
*   **Datasets:** We will use standard benchmark datasets (e.g., MoleculeNet benchmarks for small molecules, CASP targets or PDB subsets for proteins, specific material science benchmarks) for validation. Crucially, we will create specific test sets by applying *known* synthetic corruptions ($N$) to clean subsets. This allows for quantitative evaluation of error detection and correction.
*   **Baselines:** AutoQC's performance will be compared against:
    *   No curation (using raw data).
    *   Standard rule-based filtering (e.g., removing molecules with specific substructures, filtering based on resolution for PDB).
    *   Generic anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders trained for reconstruction error).
    *   Manual curation results (on a smaller subset, where feasible, as a gold standard).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Curation Quality:**
        *   *Error Detection:* Precision, Recall, F1-score for identifying synthetically introduced errors/anomalies at the sample level or feature level (e.g., identifying the specific corrupted atom/bond). ROC curves and AUC scores.
        *   *Correction Accuracy:* Measure the deviation between the corrected data $\hat{x}$ and the original ground truth $x$ (e.g., RMSD for structures, feature identity accuracy).
        *   *Distributional Similarity:* Use metrics like Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) or Wasserstein distance to compare the distribution of features in the AutoQC-curated dataset versus the original high-quality reference set.
    *   **Downstream Task Improvement:**
        *   Train standard ML predictors (e.g., GNNs for property prediction, docking simulators) on: (i) raw data, (ii) data curated by baselines, (iii) data curated by AutoQC.
        *   Compare downstream model performance using relevant metrics (e.g., RMSE/MAE for regression, Accuracy/AUC/F1 for classification). Statistical significance tests will be used to validate improvements.
    *   **Transferability of Quality Assessment:**
        *   Train AutoQC on dataset A (e.g., ChEMBL).
        *   Use the trained Adversary $D$ to score samples from a different dataset B (e.g., a proprietary industrial dataset or a dataset from a different source like PubChem).
        *   Evaluate if $D$'s scores correlate with known quality indicators or manually assessed quality in dataset B. Measure performance drop compared to scoring dataset A.
    *   **Ablation Studies:** Systematically remove components of AutoQC (e.g., adversarial loss, specific domain knowledge terms) to understand their contribution to overall performance.
