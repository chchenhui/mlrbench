1. Title  
Dual-Purpose Self-Supervised AI for Automated Molecular Dataset Curation and Quality Assessment  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Machine learning (ML) has delivered remarkable advances in computer vision and natural language processing, but its impact on biology and chemistry remains limited by dataset quality. Public molecular repositories (e.g., QM9, PDB, Tox21) often contain measurement errors, inconsistent annotations, missing values, and biases introduced by experimental protocols. Manual curation can reduce these issues but is labor-intensive, subjective, and non-scalable as the volume of molecular data grows. Consequently, ML models trained on uncurated or partially curated data may overfit to artifacts, yield unreliable predictions in downstream tasks (property prediction, virtual screening, protein folding) and fail to generalize to novel chemical space.  

Recent self-supervised approaches such as GROVER (Rong et al., 2020), MoCL (Sun et al., 2021), and persistent-homology models (Luo et al., 2023) improve representation learning on graphs, but they do not directly address data quality. Benchmarking frameworks (Wang et al., 2022) highlight gaps in dataset consistency and the need for rigorous quality assessment tools. To bridge this gap, we propose a dual-network AI system that simultaneously curates molecular datasets and learns to detect anomalies, using adversarial training plus physics-based constraints.  

Research Objectives  
1. Develop a self-supervised “curator network” that corrects or flags erroneous molecular entries (e.g., inconsistent bond orders, impossible geometries, out-of-distribution measurements).  
2. Build an “adversarial network” that continually challenges the curator by proposing subtle corruptions, ensuring robust error detection.  
3. Integrate domain knowledge—quantum-chemical constraints, graph topology priors, and chemical feasibility rules—into the training objective.  
4. Validate on diverse molecular modalities (small molecules, proteins, crystal structures) and demonstrate improvements in downstream predictive tasks.  

Significance  
By automating quality control, our system will (i) dramatically reduce manual curation effort, (ii) produce cleaner, more reliable datasets, (iii) enable fairer benchmarking, and (iv) accelerate translational ML research in life and material sciences. This work addresses a central bottleneck in deploying ML-driven discovery for medicine, agriculture, and advanced materials under real-world conditions.  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Data Collection and Corruption Protocol  
We will aggregate several public datasets:  
• QM9 (small molecules with quantum properties)  
• PDB structures (protein coordinates and metadata)  
• Tox21 (biological assay measurements)  
• Materials Project (crystal structures and computed properties)  

To train the self-supervised system, we generate controlled corruptions on a held-out high-quality subset:  
• Geometric perturbations: bond length/angle jitter beyond physical tolerances  
• Annotation swaps: label shuffling among similar molecules  
• Missing data: random removal of atomic coordinates or properties  
• Outlier injection: insert property values sampled from far tails of the empirical distribution  

These corruptions simulate real-world experimental errors. Let $X = \{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$ denote original clean entries and $\tilde X = \{\tilde x_i\}$ the corrupted versions.  

3.2 Model Architecture  
Our framework comprises two neural networks:  
A. Curator Network $C_\theta$  
• Input: corrupted data $\tilde x$.  
• Output: reconstructed entry $\hat x = C_\theta(\tilde x)$ and an anomaly score $s(\tilde x)\in[0,1]$.  
• Architecture: A graph-transformer backbone (inspired by GROVER) extended with persistent homology features (following Luo et al., 2023) and knowledge-aware contrastive priors (MoCL).  

B. Adversarial Network $A_\phi$  
• Input: reconstructed entry $\hat x$.  
• Output: perturbations $\delta$ that maximize curator error.  
• Architecture: A shallow message-passing graph neural network (GNN) that proposes modifications within predefined chemical/physical ranges.  

3.3 Training Objectives and Loss Functions  
We train $C_\theta$ and $A_\phi$ in an alternating fashion. The overall loss for $C_\theta$ is:  
$$  
L_C(\theta) \;=\; L_{\text{corr}} + \lambda\,L_{\text{adv}} + \mu\,L_{\text{phys}}  
$$  
where  
• $L_{\text{corr}}$ is the reconstruction loss (e.g., mean squared error for continuous features, cross-entropy for categorical annotations):  
$$  
L_{\text{corr}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \ell_{\text{rec}}\bigl(x_i,\,C_\theta(\tilde x_i)\bigr).  
$$  
• $L_{\text{adv}}$ penalizes failure to detect adversarial perturbations:  
$$  
L_{\text{adv}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \max\bigl(0,\; \ell_{\text{rec}}(x_i,\,\hat x_i+\delta_i) - \tau\bigr),  
$$  
with $\delta_i = A_\phi(\hat x_i)$ and threshold $\tau$.  
• $L_{\text{phys}}$ encodes physics-based chemical constraints:  
$$  
L_{\text{phys}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i \sum_{(u,v)\in \mathcal{E}_i}\bigl(d_{uv}-d_{uv}^*\bigr)^2  
$$  
where $d_{uv}$ is the predicted bond length, $d_{uv}^*$ the quantum-computed ideal distance, and $\mathcal{E}_i$ the edge set.  

The adversarial network is trained to maximize curator reconstruction error subject to small perturbations:  
$$  
\max_{\phi}\;L_{\text{adv}}(C_\theta, A_\phi) \quad\text{subject to}\quad \|\delta\|_p \le \epsilon.  
$$  

3.4 Algorithmic Steps  
1. Pre-training: initialize $C_\theta$ with standard self-supervised objectives (mask prediction, contrastive loss).  
2. Corruption generation: produce $\tilde X$ from $X$.  
3. Alternating optimization:  
   a. Fix $\phi$, update $\theta$ by minimizing $L_C(\theta)$.  
   b. Fix $\theta$, update $\phi$ by maximizing $L_{\text{adv}}$.  
4. Periodically fine-tune $C_\theta$ on uncorrupted data to preserve fidelity.  
5. At convergence, use $s(\tilde x)$ to flag suspect entries in new datasets.  

3.5 Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics  
Datasets for validation:  
• Held-out clean subsets for corruption detection accuracy.  
• Standard benchmarks for downstream tasks (e.g., Solubility, Protein–Ligand Affinity, Band-Gap prediction).  

Baselines:  
• Raw data (no curation)  
• Manual curation by experts  
• Single-network anomaly detectors (e.g., GraphAutoencoder, DeepSVDD)  
• Self-supervised representation models (GROVER, MoCL) without curation  

Metrics:  
1. Anomaly detection: precision, recall, F1-score on known corruption labels.  
2. Correction accuracy: fraction of corrupted entries fully restored.  
3. Downstream performance:  
   – Regression (e.g., molecular property prediction): RMSE, MAE, $R^2$.  
   – Classification (e.g., toxicity, activity): accuracy, AUC-ROC.  
4. Generalization: cross-dataset evaluation on molecules unseen during training.  
5. Computational efficiency: time per entry, scalability to millions of molecules.  

Ablation studies will assess the impact of:  
• Physics constraints ($L_{\text{phys}}$)  
• Adversarial training ($L_{\text{adv}}$)  
• Persistent homology features  
• Domain-aware contrastive losses  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Expected Outcomes  
• A unified dual-network framework that achieves >90% F1 in detecting synthetic corruptions and corrects >80% of them on held-out benchmarks.  
• Demonstrated improvement in downstream ML tasks: 10–20% reduction in RMSE on property predictions when trained on curated data vs. raw.  
• A transferable “data quality score” $s(x)$ that correlates with expert assessments (Pearson $r>0.8$).  
• Open-source software and curated benchmarks releasing both the corrected datasets and the quality assessment tool.  

Broader Impact  
By automating the most laborious step in life-science ML—dataset curation—our work will:  
• Accelerate drug discovery and materials design through faster turnaround from data generation to model deployment.  
• Standardize quality assessment across academic and industrial pipelines, reducing irreproducibility.  
• Enable smaller labs and startups to leverage ML without large curation teams.  
• Foster new benchmarks and competitions in dataset quality, stimulating further research at the intersection of ML, chemistry, and biology.  

In summary, this proposal charts a clear path to overcome a key barrier in molecular machine learning. It leverages recent advances in self-supervision, adversarial training, and domain integration to deliver a practical, high-impact solution for dataset quality control across life and material sciences.
