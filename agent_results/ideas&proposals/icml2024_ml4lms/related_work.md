**Key Challenges**:

1. **Data Quality and Consistency**: Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of molecular datasets is critical, as errors and inconsistencies can lead to unreliable models.

2. **Limited Labeled Data**: The scarcity of labeled molecular data hampers the training of supervised models, necessitating the development of effective self-supervised learning techniques.

3. **Generalization to Novel Molecules**: Models often struggle to generalize to newly synthesized molecules, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios.

4. **Evaluation Methodologies**: Current evaluation frameworks may not comprehensively assess the quality of molecular embeddings, leading to potential misinterpretations of model performance.

5. **Integration of Domain Knowledge**: Effectively incorporating domain-specific knowledge into machine learning models remains a challenge, yet it is essential for improving model interpretability and performance.
