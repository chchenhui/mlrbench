### Title: Multi-Scale Representation Learning for Molecular Dynamics

### Motivation
The study of molecular dynamics in biology and chemistry is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of biological systems and materials. However, the complexity of these systems, ranging from atomic and molecular scales to cellular and tissue levels, poses significant challenges for traditional machine learning approaches. This research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical applications by developing multi-scale representation learning techniques that can handle the diverse and complex data representations required for molecular dynamics.

### Main Idea
The proposed research focuses on developing a novel framework for multi-scale representation learning that can integrate various levels of molecular representation, from electronic structure data to protein sequences and omics data. The framework will employ a combination of graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformers to capture the hierarchical and multi-scale nature of molecular dynamics.

The methodology will involve:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Curating and preprocessing diverse molecular datasets, including electronic structure data, protein sequences, and omics data.
2. **Multi-Scale Representation Learning**: Designing a hybrid model that combines GNNs for capturing local interactions and transformers for capturing global context across different scales.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: Training the model on benchmark datasets and evaluating its performance on tasks such as molecular property prediction, drug discovery, and material design.

The expected outcomes include:
- Improved predictive models for molecular dynamics.
- Enhanced understanding of the interplay between different scales of molecular representations.
- Practical applications in drug discovery, material science, and bioinformatics.

The potential impact of this research is significant, as it can accelerate the development of new medicines, materials, and agro-chemicals, contributing to addressing global challenges such as climate change, population growth, and health issues.
