**Title:** Cross-Scale Property Prediction Benchmark for Materials Discovery

**Motivation:** Evaluating ML models for materials science is hampered by a lack of standardized benchmarks that assess generalization across different data scales and representations (e.g., from electronic structure to crystal graphs). This hinders comparing model robustness and identifying architectures suitable for real-world, multi-faceted material design challenges relevant to industry.

**Main Idea:** We propose creating a comprehensive benchmark suite focused on predicting material properties across multiple scales. This involves curating linked datasets representing the same materials using diverse modalities (e.g., DFT calculations, simulated XRD patterns, crystal graphs, compositional data). The benchmark tasks will require models to predict key properties (e.g., stability, conductivity, catalytic activity) using single or multiple input modalities, explicitly testing cross-scale prediction and data fusion capabilities. Expected outcomes include standardized leaderboards highlighting robust models, insights into effective representations for specific tasks, and a clearer path for developing industrially relevant ML tools for accelerated materials discovery.
