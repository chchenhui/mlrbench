# Dual-Purpose AI for Molecular Dataset Curation and Analysis: Automating Quality Control in Life Science ML

## Motivation
Machine learning applications in life sciences are hindered by poor quality datasets that contain experimental errors, inconsistencies, and biases. Current curation practices are largely manual, time-consuming, and subjective, leading to unreliable models and benchmarks. This challenge is particularly acute with biological and chemical data where errors and inconsistencies are difficult to detect automatically. As a result, many promising ML approaches fail in real-world applications despite showing excellent performance on benchmark datasets.

## Main Idea
We propose a self-supervised AI system that simultaneously curates molecular datasets while learning to identify common data quality issues. The system employs a dual-network architecture: a "curator network" that identifies and corrects inconsistencies, and an "adversarial network" that challenges these corrections. By training on partially corrupted high-quality datasets, the system learns patterns of experimental artifacts, inconsistent measurements, and anomalous data points. The approach incorporates domain knowledge through physics-based constraints and chemical feasibility checks, creating a framework that can be adapted to diverse molecular data types (protein structures, small molecules, crystal structures). This solution not only improves existing datasets but also creates a transferable quality assessment tool that can evaluate new data sources in real-time, significantly accelerating the reliable application of ML in life sciences and materials discovery.
