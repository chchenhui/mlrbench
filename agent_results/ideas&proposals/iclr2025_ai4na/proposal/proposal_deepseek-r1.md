**Research Proposal: DiffuNA – Diffusion-Powered Generative Design of RNA Therapeutics**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
RNA therapeutics represent a transformative frontier in medicine, with applications ranging from vaccines (e.g., mRNA COVID-19 vaccines) to gene silencing (e.g., siRNA therapies). However, designing functional RNA molecules—such as aptamers, ribozymes, and siRNAs—remains a laborious process that relies on trial-and-error experimentation and high-throughput screening. Current computational methods for RNA design, including inverse folding tools like RNAiFold and EternaFold, often focus on secondary structure optimization but struggle to model the intricate relationship between sequence, tertiary structure, and function. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly diffusion models, offer promising avenues for addressing these challenges by learning joint distributions of sequences and structures.  

**Research Objectives**  
1. Develop **DiffuNA**, a 3D graph-based diffusion model that jointly learns RNA sequence, secondary, and tertiary structure distributions from experimental data.  
2. Integrate a reinforcement learning (RL) loop to optimize generated candidates for folding stability and target binding affinity.  
3. Validate the framework on established benchmarks (e.g., thrombin-binding aptamers, hammerhead ribozymes) and compare against state-of-the-art generative baselines.  
4. Release a scalable, open-source toolkit for AI-driven RNA therapeutic design.  

**Significance**  
DiffuNA aims to accelerate the discovery of RNA therapeutics by automating the design of high-affinity, stable molecules. By bridging the gap between sequence and 3D structure modeling, the framework could reduce reliance on costly experimental screening, enable the targeting of previously undruggable sites, and expand the scope of RNA-based therapies.

### 2. **Methodology**  
#### **Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
- **Datasets**:  
  - **3D Structures**: Curate RNA structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and RNA-Puzzles.  
  - **Secondary Structures**: Integrate SHAPE reactivity data from the RMDB database to infer dynamic secondary structures.  
  - **Sequence-Structure Pairs**: Use existing tools (e.g., trRosettaRNA, FARFAR2) to generate synthetic data for underrepresented RNA classes.  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Represent RNA molecules as **3D graphs** where nodes correspond to nucleotides (featurized with atomic coordinates, base types, and torsion angles) and edges encode spatial proximity (cutoff: 10Å) and covalent bonds.  
  - Normalize structural coordinates and augment data via random rotations/translations to ensure SE(3)-equivariance.  

#### **Model Architecture**  
DiffuNA combines a **denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)** with a **graph neural network (GNN)** backbone:  

1. **Forward Diffusion Process**:  
   Gradually corrupt input RNA graphs $G_0$ over $T$ timesteps by adding Gaussian noise to node features (coordinates, base types) and edge connections:  
   $$q(G_t | G_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}\left(G_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}G_{t-1}, \beta_t\mathbf{I}\right),$$  
   where $\beta_t$ is a noise schedule.  

2. **Reverse Denoising Process**:  
   Train a GNN $f_\theta$ to predict the denoised graph $G_{t-1}$ from $G_t$ at each step. The network architecture includes:  
   - **SE(3)-equivariant GNN layers** to update node coordinates and features while preserving rotational invariance.  
   - **Transformer-based sequence modules** to model nucleotide dependencies.  
   - **Conditional embedding layers** to incorporate user-specified constraints (e.g., target binding pockets).  

   The loss function minimizes the denoising error:  
   $$\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{t, G_0, \epsilon}\left[\|\epsilon - f_\theta(G_t, t)\|^2\right].$$  

3. **Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning**:  
   After pre-training, refine generated candidates using an RL loop:  
   - **Reward Function**: $R = \alpha R_{\text{stability}} + \beta R_{\text{affinity}} + \gamma R_{\text{diversity}}$, where:  
     - $R_{\text{stability}}$: Predicted folding free energy from a pretrained UFold model.  
     - $R_{\text{affinity}}$: Docking score from a surrogate model (e.g., AutoDock Vina).  
     - $R_{\text{diversity}}$: Penalty for low structural/sequence diversity.  
   - **Policy Gradient Optimization**: Update $f_\theta$ using proximal policy optimization (PPO) to maximize $R$.  

#### **Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against RiboDiffusion (structure-conditioned inverse folding), DiffSBDD (protein-ligand diffusion), and EternaFold (secondary structure prediction).  
- **Benchmarks**:  
  - **Thrombin-Binding Aptamers**: Measure success rate of generating sequences with <1 nM binding affinity.  
  - **Hammerhead Ribozymes**: Evaluate catalytic activity via in silico cleavage assays.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Novelty**: Percentage of generated sequences not found in training data.  
  - **Affinity/Stability**: Docking scores and folding free energy.  
  - **Diversity**: Tanimoto diversity index for sequences and RMSD diversity for structures.  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Use Welch’s t-test to confirm significance (p < 0.05) over baselines.
