# DiffuNA: Diffusion-Powered Generative Design of RNA Therapeutics with Joint Sequence-Structure Optimization

## 1. Introduction

### Background
RNA therapeutics represent a rapidly expanding frontier in modern medicine, offering unprecedented specificity in targeting diseases at the genetic level. Unlike traditional small-molecule drugs, RNA-based therapeutics—including aptamers, ribozymes, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and antisense oligonucleotides—can interact with targets previously considered "undruggable," opening new avenues for treating genetic disorders, cancers, and infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the potential of RNA-based interventions with the remarkable success of mRNA vaccines.

Despite this promise, the design of functional RNA molecules remains predominantly reliant on laborious experimental methods such as SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) for aptamers or combinatorial screening for ribozymes. These approaches require extensive laboratory resources, typically taking months to years and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars per successful candidate. The vast sequence space of potential RNA therapeutics—even a short 30-nucleotide RNA has 4^30 (≈10^18) possible sequences—makes exhaustive experimental exploration infeasible.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in generative modeling, offer promising computational alternatives to accelerate this discovery process. Deep learning approaches have already demonstrated success in protein design and small molecule drug discovery. However, RNA presents unique challenges due to its conformational flexibility, the intricate relationship between sequence and 3D structure, and the relative scarcity of experimentally validated 3D structural data compared to proteins.

### Research Objectives
The primary goal of this research is to develop DiffuNA, a novel diffusion-based generative framework for the automated design of functional RNA therapeutics that jointly optimizes sequence and structure. Specifically, our objectives are to:

1. Develop a 3D graph-based diffusion model that effectively captures the joint distribution of RNA sequences and their secondary and tertiary structures
2. Implement a conditional generation approach that allows for targeted design based on binding pocket geometry or desired structural scaffolds
3. Integrate a reinforcement learning optimization loop to refine candidate sequences based on folding stability and binding affinity
4. Validate the approach on well-characterized RNA therapeutic targets and assess its ability to generate novel, functional candidates

### Significance
The successful development of DiffuNA would transform the RNA therapeutic design landscape by:

1. **Accelerating Discovery**: Reducing the time to identify promising RNA therapeutic candidates from years to days or hours
2. **Expanding Chemical Space**: Enabling exploration of novel sequence regions that might be missed by traditional screening approaches
3. **Reducing Development Costs**: Dramatically lowering the resources required for initial lead discovery
4. **Enabling Target-Specific Design**: Facilitating customized RNA molecules designed specifically for challenging targets
5. **Advancing Scientific Understanding**: Providing new insights into the sequence-structure-function relationships of RNA molecules

This research addresses a critical bottleneck in RNA therapeutics development and aligns with the growing interest in AI-powered biotechnology solutions. By bridging the gap between computational prediction and experimental validation, DiffuNA could catalyze a new wave of RNA therapeutic discovery with broad implications for human health.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Collection and Processing

#### 2.1.1 Primary Data Sources
We will compile a comprehensive dataset from multiple sources:

1. **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**: All available high-resolution (<3.0Å) RNA 3D structures, including ribozymes, aptamers, and riboswitches
2. **RNA-Puzzles Repository**: Experimentally validated RNA 3D structures from community-wide structure prediction experiments
3. **RNAcentral**: Curated non-coding RNA sequences with functional annotations
4. **SHAPE and DMS Probing Data**: Chemical probing data that provides information on RNA secondary structure from databases like RNA Mapping Database (RMDB)
5. **Aptamer Database**: Experimentally validated RNA aptamers with binding affinity data

#### 2.1.2 Data Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Structure Normalization**: Standardize atom naming and remove experimental artifacts
2. **Quality Filtering**: Remove structures with missing residues or poor electron density
3. **Redundancy Reduction**: Cluster structures by sequence similarity (80% threshold) to reduce dataset bias
4. **Graph Construction**: Convert RNA structures into 3D molecular graphs where:
   - Nodes represent nucleotides with features including nucleotide identity, backbone torsion angles, and local geometric descriptors
   - Edges represent covalent bonds, base-pairing interactions, base-stacking, and spatial proximity
5. **Data Augmentation**: Generate additional training examples via controlled perturbations of existing structures while preserving key motifs

The final processed dataset will include pairs of (sequence, 3D structure) as well as functional annotations where available. We anticipate approximately 5,000-10,000 non-redundant RNA structures for model training.

### 2.2 DiffuNA Model Architecture

#### 2.2.1 Core Diffusion Framework
DiffuNA employs a 3D equivariant graph diffusion model that operates in a joint sequence-structure space. The diffusion process follows:

1. **Forward Process (Noise Addition)**:
   For a clean RNA graph $\mathbf{G}_0 = (\mathbf{X}_0, \mathbf{E}_0, \mathbf{S}_0)$ where $\mathbf{X}_0$ represents 3D coordinates, $\mathbf{E}_0$ represents edge features, and $\mathbf{S}_0$ represents sequence features (nucleotide identities), we define a forward diffusion process:

   $$q(\mathbf{G}_t|\mathbf{G}_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{X}_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}\mathbf{X}_{t-1}, \beta_t\mathbf{I}) \cdot \text{Cat}(\mathbf{S}_t; \mathbf{S}_{t-1}\mathbf{Q}_t)$$

   where $\beta_t$ is the noise schedule, $\mathbf{Q}_t$ is a transition matrix for discrete nucleotide features, and $t \in [1, T]$ represents diffusion steps.

2. **Reverse Process (Denoising)**:
   The model learns to reverse the diffusion process by predicting the denoising distribution:

   $$p_\theta(\mathbf{G}_{t-1}|\mathbf{G}_t, \mathbf{c}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{X}_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(\mathbf{G}_t, t, \mathbf{c}), \Sigma_\theta(\mathbf{G}_t, t, \mathbf{c})) \cdot \text{Cat}(\mathbf{S}_{t-1}; \mathbf{P}_\theta(\mathbf{G}_t, t, \mathbf{c}))$$

   where $\mathbf{c}$ represents optional conditioning information (e.g., binding pocket geometry), and $\mu_\theta$, $\Sigma_\theta$, and $\mathbf{P}_\theta$ are parametrized by neural networks.

#### 2.2.2 Neural Network Architecture
The denoising network combines several specialized components:

1. **E(3)-Equivariant Graph Neural Network (EGNN)**:
   To respect 3D rotational and translational invariance, we employ an EGNN that updates node features:

   $$\mathbf{h}_i^{l+1} = \mathbf{h}_i^l + \text{MLP}_h\left(\mathbf{h}_i^l, \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \phi_e(\mathbf{h}_i^l, \mathbf{h}_j^l, \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\|^2, \mathbf{e}_{ij})\right)$$

   $$\mathbf{x}_i^{l+1} = \mathbf{x}_i^l + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} (\mathbf{x}_j^l - \mathbf{x}_i^l) \cdot \phi_x(\mathbf{h}_i^l, \mathbf{h}_j^l, \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\|^2, \mathbf{e}_{ij})$$

   where $\mathbf{h}_i^l$ and $\mathbf{x}_i^l$ are node features and coordinates at layer $l$, and $\phi_e$ and $\phi_x$ are learnable functions.

2. **Sequence Prediction Module**:
   A transformer-based architecture predicts nucleotide identity distributions:

   $$\mathbf{z}_i = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{h}_i^L + \text{MHA}(\mathbf{h}_i^L, \mathbf{h}^L, \mathbf{h}^L))$$
   
   $$\mathbf{P}_\theta(\mathbf{S}_{t-1,i}|\mathbf{G}_t) = \text{Softmax}(\text{MLP}_s(\mathbf{z}_i))$$

   where MHA is multi-headed attention and $\mathbf{h}^L$ are the final EGNN embeddings.

3. **Time Embedding**:
   Sinusoidal time embeddings with dimension $d_t$:
   
   $$\tau(t)_i = \begin{cases}
   \sin(10^{4i/d_t} \cdot t), & \text{if } i \text{ is even} \\
   \cos(10^{4(i-1)/d_t} \cdot t), & \text{if } i \text{ is odd}
   \end{cases}$$

4. **Conditioning Module**:
   For target-specific design, we encode conditioning information (e.g., protein binding pocket) using a separate EGNN encoder and inject this information via cross-attention:
   
   $$\mathbf{h}_i^{l+1} = \mathbf{h}_i^l + \text{MLP}_h\left(\mathbf{h}_i^l, \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \phi_e(...)\right) + \text{CrossAttention}(\mathbf{h}_i^l, \mathbf{c})$$

### 2.3 Model Training

#### 2.3.1 Loss Functions
We optimize multiple objectives:

1. **Coordinate Denoising Loss**:
   $$\mathcal{L}_\text{coord} = \mathbb{E}_{t, \mathbf{G}_0, \epsilon}\left[\|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{G}_t, t, \mathbf{c})\|_2^2\right]$$

2. **Sequence Denoising Loss**:
   $$\mathcal{L}_\text{seq} = \mathbb{E}_{t, \mathbf{G}_0}\left[-\log p_\theta(\mathbf{S}_{t-1}|\mathbf{G}_t, \mathbf{c})\right]$$

3. **Structure Consistency Loss**:
   $$\mathcal{L}_\text{consist} = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{G}_0}\left[D_\text{KL}(p_\phi(\mathbf{S}|\mathbf{X}_0) \| p_\theta(\mathbf{S}_0|\mathbf{X}_0, \mathbf{c}))\right]$$
   
   where $p_\phi$ is a pretrained RNA folding predictor.

The total loss is a weighted sum:
$$\mathcal{L}_\text{total} = \mathcal{L}_\text{coord} + \lambda_\text{seq}\mathcal{L}_\text{seq} + \lambda_\text{consist}\mathcal{L}_\text{consist}$$

#### 2.3.2 Training Procedure
1. **Curriculum Learning**: Start with simpler, shorter RNA structures and gradually introduce more complex ones
2. **Gradient Accumulation**: To handle larger batch sizes on limited hardware
3. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Using AdamW optimizer with cosine learning rate schedule
4. **Early Stopping**: Based on validation loss to prevent overfitting
5. **Mixed Precision Training**: For computational efficiency

### 2.4 Reinforcement Learning Optimization Loop

After initial diffusion-based generation, we implement a reinforcement learning (RL) loop to refine candidate RNA sequences for optimized properties:

#### 2.4.1 RL Framework
We formulate the refinement as a Markov Decision Process (MDP):
- **State**: Current RNA sequence and predicted structure
- **Actions**: Point mutations, insertions, or deletions in the sequence
- **Reward**: Weighted combination of folding stability and binding affinity metrics

#### 2.4.2 Policy Network
A graph transformer-based policy network predicts action probabilities:
$$\pi_\theta(a|s) = \text{Softmax}(\text{MLP}_\pi(\text{GraphTransformer}(s)))$$

#### 2.4.3 Reward Function
$$R(s) = w_\text{fold} \cdot \text{DeltaG}_\text{fold}(s) + w_\text{bind} \cdot \text{Affinity}_\text{pred}(s, \text{target}) + w_\text{div} \cdot \text{Diversity}(s)$$

where:
- $\text{DeltaG}_\text{fold}$ is the predicted folding free energy from an RNA folding model (e.g., EternaFold)
- $\text{Affinity}_\text{pred}$ is the predicted binding affinity from a docking surrogate model
- $\text{Diversity}$ is a diversity term to encourage exploration of novel sequence space

#### 2.4.4 Optimization Algorithm
We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to update the policy network:
$$\mathcal{L}_\text{PPO}(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t\left[\min(r_t(\theta)\hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)\hat{A}_t)\right]$$

where $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_\text{old}}(a_t|s_t)}$ is the probability ratio and $\hat{A}_t$ is the advantage estimate.
