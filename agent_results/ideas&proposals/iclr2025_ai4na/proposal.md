# DiffuNA – Diffusion-Powered Generative Design of RNA Therapeutics

## Introduction

### Background  
RNA therapeutics—encompassing aptamers, ribozymes, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)—have emerged as transformative tools for precision medicine, offering unparalleled specificity in targeting disease-associated proteins and pathways. However, the design of functional RNA molecules remains bottlenecked by laborious experimental screening and heuristic approaches. Traditional methods like SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) rely on iterative rounds of selection, incurring high costs and time. Computational approaches, particularly generative AI, promise to revolutionize this paradigm by enabling *de novo* design of RNA sequences with predefined structural and functional properties.

Recent advances in diffusion models and graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in modeling complex biomolecular systems. For instance, RiboDiffusion (2024) leverages diffusion models for RNA inverse folding, while DiffSBDD (2022) applies equivariant diffusion for ligand generation conditioned on protein pockets. Despite these strides, a unified framework for RNA therapeutic design that jointly optimizes sequence, tertiary structure, and binding affinity remains unmet. Existing tools like RNAComposer (2022) and FARFAR2 (2020) focus on structure prediction rather than generative design, and their outputs often lack explicit optimization for therapeutic properties such as binding affinity or stability.

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop **DiffuNA**, a 3D graph-based diffusion model for the generative design of RNA therapeutics. The key objectives are:  
1. To learn joint distributions over RNA sequences, secondary structures, and tertiary folds using a graph diffusion framework.  
2. To integrate reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing generated candidates toward user-specified targets (e.g., binding pockets or structural scaffolds).  
3. To validate DiffuNA on benchmark tasks, including thrombin-binding aptamer generation and hammerhead ribozyme design, outperforming existing generative baselines.  

### Significance  
DiffuNA addresses critical gaps in RNA therapeutic discovery:  
- **Accelerated Lead Generation**: By replacing trial-and-error screening with AI-driven design, DiffuNA could reduce development timelines from months to days.  
- **Novelty and Diversity**: Diffusion models excel at exploring latent spaces, enabling the discovery of unconventional RNA motifs with enhanced stability or affinity.  
- **Therapeutic Expansion**: The framework will facilitate the design of RNAs targeting previously "undruggable" proteins, broadening the scope of RNA-based therapies.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing  
**Datasets**:  
- **Structural Data**: RNA 3D structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), filtered for resolution (<3.5 Å) and functional annotations.  
- **Reactivity Data**: SHAPE (Selective 2'-Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension) reactivity profiles from the RNA Mapping Database (RMDB) to infer flexibility.  
- **Sequence-Structure Pairs**: Curated from Rfam families with known secondary structures and tertiary contacts.  

**Preprocessing**:  
1. **Graph Construction**: Each RNA is represented as a 3D graph $ G = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}) $, where:  
   - Nodes $ v_i \in \mathcal{V} $ encode nucleotide identity (A, U, C, G), chemical modifications (if any), and positional embeddings.  
   - Edges $ e_{ij} \in \mathcal{E} $ connect covalent bonds (phosphodiester linkages) and spatial neighbors within 8 Å interatomic distance. Edge features include relative positions $ \Delta \mathbf{x}_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}^3 $, bond angles, and dihedral angles.  

2. **Noise Injection**: Structural coordinates are perturbed with Gaussian noise $ \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I) $, while sequences undergo token masking (15% masked tokens).  

### Diffusion Model Architecture  
**Forward Process**:  
The diffusion model corrupts RNA graphs over $ T $ steps:  
$$
q(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} \mathbf{x}_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
$$  
where $ \mathbf{x}_t $ denotes node/edge attributes at step $ t $, and $ \beta_t $ controls noise scale.  

**Reverse Process**:  
A denoising neural network $ \epsilon_\theta $ learns to reverse the process:  
$$
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \mathbf{x}_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t))
$$  
The model is trained to predict noise $ \epsilon $ via the loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{t, \mathbf{x}_0, \epsilon} \left[ \| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t) \|^2 \right]
$$  

**Network Design**:  
- **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**: A hierarchical GNN (e.g., SE(3)-Transformer) processes 3D coordinates and edge features to capture spatial interactions.  
- **Sequence Module**: A Transformer decoder generates nucleotide sequences autoregressively, conditioned on structural contexts.  
- **Cross-Modal Attention**: GNN embeddings guide sequence generation via attention mechanisms, ensuring sequence-structure consistency.  

### Reinforcement Learning Integration  
To refine candidates for therapeutic properties, an RL loop optimizes:  
1. **Folding Stability**: Predicted by a pretrained RNA folding predictor (e.g., RNAfold or EternaFold).  
2. **Binding Affinity**: Estimated via a docking surrogate model (e.g., AutoDock Vina or a geometric deep learning model like EquiDock).  

**Reward Function**:  
$$
R = \alpha \cdot (-\Delta G) + \beta \cdot \log(K_i^{-1})
$$  
where $ \Delta G $ is folding free energy, $ K_i $ is binding affinity, and $ \alpha, \beta $ are hyperparameters.  

**Policy Gradient Training**:  
The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm updates the diffusion model to maximize $ R $, with a curriculum learning strategy starting from simple targets (e.g., hairpins) to complex scaffolds.  

### Experimental Design  
**Benchmarks**:  
- **Thrombin-Binding Aptamers**: Generate 15–29 nucleotide RNAs targeting thrombin’s fibrinogen-binding site.  
- **Hammerhead Ribozymes**: Design self-cleaving RNAs with catalytic core stability.  

**Baselines**:  
- RiboDiffusion (2024): Sequence generation conditioned on structures.  
- RNAComposer (2022): Template-based 3D structure prediction.  
- FARFAR2 (2020): De novo tertiary structure prediction.  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
1. **Sequence Recovery**: Percentage of generated sequences matching known functional motifs.  
2. **Diversity**: Average Levenshtein distance between generated sequences.  
3. **Binding Affinity**: $ K_d $ from docking simulations (lower is better).  
4. **Structural Validity**: RMSD to native structures (<2 Å considered valid).  
5. **Stability**: Folding energy $ \Delta G $ (kcal/mol).
