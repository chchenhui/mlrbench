### Title: "AI-Driven RNA Secondary Structure Prediction using Deep Learning and Protein Sequence Data"

### Motivation:
Accurate prediction of RNA secondary structure is crucial for understanding RNA function and designing therapeutic interventions. Current methods often rely on limited data and struggle with complex RNA molecules. This research aims to improve RNA secondary structure prediction by leveraging deep learning models and integrating protein sequence data, which can provide additional structural insights.

### Main Idea:
This research proposal focuses on developing a novel deep learning model that integrates RNA sequence data with protein sequence data to predict RNA secondary structures more accurately. The methodology involves:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather RNA and protein sequence datasets, and preprocess the data to extract relevant features.
2. **Model Architecture**: Design a hybrid deep learning model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for RNA sequence analysis and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for protein sequence analysis. The model will use attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different features.
3. **Training and Validation**: Train the model on large-scale datasets and validate its performance using cross-validation techniques. The model will be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Expected Outcomes**: The proposed model is expected to achieve higher accuracy in RNA secondary structure prediction compared to existing methods. It will also provide insights into the relationship between RNA and protein sequences, which can aid in understanding RNA function and designing therapeutic interventions.
5. **Potential Impact**: This research has the potential to advance our understanding of RNA biology and facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies. The model can be applied to various RNA-based therapies, including RNA drugs and gene editing technologies, and can contribute to the broader AI for nucleic acids research community.
