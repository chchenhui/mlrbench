1. **Title**: Integrating Active Learning with Multimodal Foundation Models for Efficient RNA Design  

2. **Motivation**:  
RNA therapeutic design requires sequences with specific folding, stability, and binding properties, but current methods struggle to balance computational accuracy with experimental viability. Existing foundation models are often trained on static datasets, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic constraints like cellular context or chemical modifications. Developing adaptive AI frameworks that bridge computational predictions and experimental validation can accelerate RNA-based drug discovery by reducing costly trial-and-error iterations.  

3. **Main Idea**:  
This work proposes an active learning framework synergized with a multimodal RNA foundation model (FM) to iteratively refine RNA designs. The FM pre-trains on diverse data—RNA sequences, secondary/tertiary structures, and functional assays (e.g., binding affinity, stability)—using geometric and transformer architectures. A reinforcement learning module integrates experimental feedback (e.g., in silico simulations or lab assays) to dynamically prioritize poorly understood regions of the RNA design space. The system alternates between: (a) generating candidate sequences with desired properties (e.g., target binding), (b) validating them in silico/vitro, and (c) updating the FM with new data. Expected outcomes include a 2–3x reduction in experimental cost and improved generation of stable, high-affinity RNA molecules. This impact extends to accelerating RNA therapeutics and synthetic biology, empowering data-efficient discovery of functional RNA systems.
