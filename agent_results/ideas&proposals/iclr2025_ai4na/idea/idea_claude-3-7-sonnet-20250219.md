# RNA-GANDesigner: Generative Adversarial Networks for Therapeutic RNA Design

## Motivation
RNA therapeutics represent a promising frontier in medicine, with potential applications in vaccine development, gene therapy, and treatment of genetic disorders. However, designing RNA molecules with specific therapeutic properties remains challenging due to the complex relationship between RNA sequence, structure, and function. Current computational methods often struggle to generate diverse, functional RNA designs that meet multiple criteria simultaneously (e.g., stability, cell penetration, low immunogenicity). An AI approach that can efficiently explore the vast RNA design space while optimizing for therapeutic potential would accelerate drug development and enable novel treatments.

## Main Idea
RNA-GANDesigner employs a conditional Generative Adversarial Network architecture specifically tailored for therapeutic RNA design. The generator network produces RNA sequences conditioned on desired therapeutic properties, while the discriminator evaluates both the realism of the sequences and their likelihood of exhibiting target characteristics. The framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical encoding scheme that captures both sequence and predicted structural information, (2) a multi-objective optimization approach that balances competing design criteria, and (3) integration of experimental feedback through active learning to continuously improve designs. The system would enable rapid prototyping of RNA therapeutics with customizable properties, potentially reducing the time and cost of pre-clinical development while expanding the repertoire of RNA-based treatments for currently untreatable diseases.
