**Title:** GeoGenRNA: Geometric Deep Learning for Conditional Generation of Functional RNA Structures

**Motivation:** Designing RNA molecules with specific tertiary structures and functions is crucial for therapeutics and synthetic biology. Current generative models often focus on sequence or secondary structure, lacking direct control over the 3D conformation essential for function. This research aims to bridge this gap by enabling the generation of novel RNA sequences conditioned on desired 3D structural properties.

**Main Idea:** We propose GeoGenRNA, a generative model based on geometric deep learning. The model will learn a joint distribution over RNA sequences and their 3D structures using large datasets of known RNA structures (e.g., PDB) and sequences. It will utilize equivariant graph neural networks to process 3D structural information (represented as graphs or point clouds) and combine it with sequence information (e.g., via transformers). Generation will be conditional: users can input a target 3D structural scaffold or key geometric constraints (e.g., specific distances, interaction motifs), and the model will generate diverse sequences predicted to fold into structures satisfying these conditions. Expected outcomes include a tool for *de novo* RNA design with structural control, enabling faster discovery of functional RNAs like aptamers or ribozymes.
