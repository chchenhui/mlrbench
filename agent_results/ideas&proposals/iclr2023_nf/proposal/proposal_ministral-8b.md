Neural Field PDE Solvers: Adaptive Activation and Meta-Learning for Physics Simulation

## **2. Introduction**

### **Background**

Partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental in physics and engineering, describing phenomena ranging from fluid dynamics to wave propagation. Traditional mesh-based methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), are computationally expensive and struggle with high-dimensional or dynamic systems. Neural fields, a class of implicit neural networks, offer a mesh-free, continuous alternative but face challenges in efficiently capturing multi-scale phenomena and adapting to varying boundary conditions.

### **Research Objectives**

The primary objective of this research is to develop a neural field framework that combines spatially adaptive activation functions and meta-learning to solve PDEs. This approach aims to:

1. **Improve PDE Solution Accuracy**: Enhance the resolution of fine-scale features by dynamically adjusting activation functions based on input coordinates.
2. **Reduce Computational Costs**: Utilize meta-learning to optimize initialization for rapid adaptation to unseen boundary/initial conditions, reducing per-scene optimization time.
3. **Enable Scalable Simulations**: Develop a model that can generalize across multiple irregular geometries without retraining, facilitating scalable, real-time simulations for complex systems.

### **Significance**

This research is significant because it bridges the gap between neural fields and computational physics, enabling more accurate and efficient simulations of physical systems. By combining adaptive activation functions and meta-learning, the proposed method aims to overcome the challenges associated with traditional PDE solvers and neural field models, paving the way for practical applications in various domains, such as fluid dynamics, wave propagation, and climate science.

## **3. Methodology**

### **3.1 Research Design**

The proposed method employs a coordinate-based neural network to map spatio-temporal coordinates to physical quantities (e.g., velocity, pressure) while enforcing PDE constraints via physics-informed losses. The key components of the method are:

1. **Coordinate-based Neural Network**: A neural network that takes input coordinates and outputs physical quantities.
2. **Adaptive Activation Functions**: Activation functions that dynamically adjust based on input coordinates, controlled by a learned attention mechanism.
3. **Physics-informed Loss Function**: A loss function that incorporates PDE constraints and is evaluated using discrete residuals from standard numerical PDE methods.
4. **Meta-learning**: A technique that optimizes initialization for rapid adaptation to unseen boundary/initial conditions.

### **3.2 Data Collection**

The dataset will consist of PDEs from various domains, including fluid dynamics, wave propagation, and climate science. The dataset will include:

1. **Boundary and Initial Conditions**: Defining the initial and boundary conditions for each PDE.
2. **Ground Truth Solutions**: The exact solutions or reference solutions for each PDE problem.
3. **Input Coordinates**: The spatial and temporal coordinates at which the physical quantities are to be predicted.

### **3.3 Algorithmic Steps**

The algorithmic steps for the proposed method are as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the neural network parameters.
   - Initialize the adaptive activation functions.

2. **Forward Pass**:
   - Input the spatio-temporal coordinates into the neural network.
   - Apply the adaptive activation functions based on the learned attention mechanism.
   - Output the predicted physical quantities.

3. **Loss Calculation**:
   - Calculate the physics-informed loss function by evaluating discrete residuals from standard numerical PDE methods.
   - Calculate the data loss by comparing the predicted physical quantities with the ground truth solutions.

4. **Backward Pass**:
   - Compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the neural network parameters and adaptive activation functions.
   - Update the neural network parameters and adaptive activation functions using an optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam).

5. **Meta-learning**:
   - Optimize the initialization for rapid adaptation to unseen boundary/initial conditions using a meta-learning algorithm (e.g., MAML).

6. **Iteration**:
   - Repeat steps 2-5 for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence.

### **3.4 Mathematical Formulations**

The physics-informed loss function can be expressed as:

$$
L(\theta, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{i}) = \underbrace{\alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{data}}(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{u}_{\text{gt}})}_{\text{Data Loss}} + \underbrace{\beta \mathcal{L}_{\text{pde}}(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{u}_{\text{pde}})}_{\text{PDE Loss}}
$$

where:
- $\theta$ are the neural network parameters.
- $\mathbf{x}$ are the input coordinates.
- $\mathbf{u}$ are the predicted physical quantities.
- $\mathbf{u}_{\text{gt}}$ are the ground truth solutions.
- $\mathbf{u}_{\text{pde}}$ are the PDE residuals.
- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the weighting factors for the data loss and PDE loss, respectively.

The adaptive activation functions can be controlled by a learned attention mechanism, which can be expressed as:

$$
A(\mathbf{x}) = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_a \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}_a)
$$

where:
- $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.
- $\mathbf{W}_a$ and $\mathbf{b}_a$ are the learned parameters of the attention mechanism.
