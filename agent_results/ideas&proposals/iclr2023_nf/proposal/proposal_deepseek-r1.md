### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Partial differential equations (PDEs) are foundational to modeling physical phenomena in engineering and science, from fluid dynamics to climate prediction. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite element analysis (FEM), rely on mesh-based discretization, which becomes computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional or dynamic systems. Recent advances in machine learning have introduced neural networks that networks that networks that represent continuous spatio-temporal signals—as a mesh-free alternative. These networks map spatial/temporal coordinates directly to physical quantities (e.g., velocity, pressure) while enforcing PDE constraints via physics-informed losses. However, challenges persist in efficiently capturing multi-scale features, adapting to varying boundary conditions, and reducing per-scene optimization time.

**Research Objectives**  
This research aims to develop a neural field framework that integrates **spatially adaptive activation functions** and **meta-learning** to address these challenges. Specific objectives include:  
1. Design a neural field architecture with dynamic activation functions that adaptively resolve fine-scale features.  
2. Incorporate meta-learning to enable rapid adaptation to unseen boundary/initial conditions.  
3. Validate the framework on fluid dynamics and wave propagation benchmarks, comparing accuracy and efficiency against FEM and baseline solvers.  

**Significance**  
The proposed framework bridges computational physics and machine learning by offering a scalable, real-time solution for PDE-based simulations. Success would advance applications in aerospace engineering (turbulence modeling), climate science (weather prediction), and biomedical systems (blood flow analysis). By addressing key limitations of neural fields, this work also contributes to broader adoption in interdisciplinary domains.

### 3. **Methodology**  
**Research Design**  
The framework combines three components:  
1. **Coordinate-Based Neural Field**: A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) parameterizing physical quantities (e.g., velocity $\mathbf{u}(x,t)$) as continuous functions of spatio-temporal coordinates $(x,t)$.  
2. **Spatially Adaptive Activation Functions**: A learnable attention mechanism modulates activation slopes based on input coordinates to capture multi-scale phenomena.  
3. **Meta-Learning Initialization**: Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) optimizes initial parameters for fast adaptation to new PDE configurations.  

**Mathematical Formulation**  
- **Neural Field Representation**:  
  $$ \mathbf{u}(x,t) = f_\theta(x,t), $$  
  where $f_\theta$ is an MLP with weights $\theta$.  

- **Physics-Informed Loss**:  
  $$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{PDE}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left\| \mathcal{N}\left[\mathbf{u}(x_i,t_i)\right] \right\|^2 + \lambda_{\text{BC}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{BC}} + \lambda_{\text{IC}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{IC}}, $$  
  where $\mathcal{N}$ is the PDE residual, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{BC}}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{IC}}$ enforce boundary/initial conditions, and $\lambda$ are weighting terms.  

- **Adaptive Activation**:  
  For each neuron, the activation at layer $l$ is:  
  $$ \sigma_l(z) = a_l(x,t) \cdot \text{ReLU}(z) + (1 - a_l(x,t)) \cdot \sin(z), $$  
  where $a_l(x,t) \in [0,1]$ is an attention coefficient learned via a hypernetwork conditioned on $(x,t)$.  

- **Meta-Learning Objective**:  
  Given a distribution of PDE tasks $p(\mathcal{T})$, MAML minimizes:  
  $$ \min_\theta \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{T} \sim p(\mathcal{T})} \left[ \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}}\left( \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}}(\theta) \right) \right], $$  
  where $\alpha$ is the step size for inner-loop adaptation.  

**Data Collection & Experimental Design**  
- **Benchmarks**:  
  - **Fluid Dynamics**: 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (vortex shedding, turbulence).  
  - **Wave Propagation**: 3D acoustic wave equation with varying material properties.  
  Datasets include synthetic solutions from FEM and experimental measurements (e.g., particle image velocimetry).  

- **Baselines**:  
  - Traditional solvers: FEM, finite difference.  
  - Neural baselines: PINNs, Physics-informed PointNet (PIPN), Metamizer.  

- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Accuracy**: Relative $L^2$ error, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM).  
  - **Efficiency**: Training time, inference time per timestep, memory usage.  
  - **Adaptation**: Few-shot adaptation error on unseen boundary conditions.  

**Implementation Details**  
- **Architecture**: 8-layer MLP with 256 hidden units, Swish activations, and adaptive modulation.  
- **Training**: Adam optimizer (learning rate $10^{-3}$), meta-learning outer-loop learning rate $10^{-4}$.  
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA A100 GPUs for parallelized training and inference.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Accuracy**: The adaptive activation mechanism will resolve fine-scale features (e.g., turbulent eddies) with $>30\%$ lower $L^2$ error compared to fixed-activation PINNs.  
2. **Faster Adaptation**: Meta-learning will reduce per-scene optimization time by 50% for new boundary conditions.  
3. **Scalability**: The framework will handle 3D wave propagation problems with $10^6$ evaluation points in real-time (<1s per timestep).  

**Impact**  
- **Scientific**: Enable high-fidelity simulations of complex systems (e.g., climate models) with reduced computational costs.  
- **Technological**: Accelerate industrial design cycles (e.g., aerodynamic optimization) through rapid prototyping.  
- **Methodological**: Advance neural field research by introducing adaptive activations and meta-learning as general tools for PDE solving.  

**Broader Implications**  
By unifying neural fields with computational physics, this work will foster interdisciplinary collaboration, as outlined in the workshop’s goals. It directly addresses key challenges in the literature, such as multi-scale modeling (Wang et al., 2023) and geometry generalization (Kashefi & Mukerji, 2023), while proposing novel solutions through meta-learning (Asl et al., 2025) and adaptive architectures.
