### Title: Neural Field PDE Solvers: Adaptive Activation and Meta-Learning for Physics Simulation

### Introduction

Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental to modeling physical systems across disciplines, from fluid dynamics and structural mechanics to climate modeling and quantum physics. Traditional numerical methods, including finite element and finite volume approaches, rely on mesh discretization and are computationally intensive, particularly when applied to high-dimensional or dynamically evolving domains. These techniques also often struggle to generalize across varying boundary conditions without re-meshing or re-running simulations. In contrast, neural fields—coordinate-based neural networks that model continuous signals—provide a promising mesh-free paradigm for approximating PDE solutions. By parameterizing the solution space implicitly, neural fields offer advantages in scalability, adaptability, and memory efficiency, making them well-suited for handling complex physical problems where classical methods fall short.

The central hypothesis of this research is that combining spatially adaptive activation functions and meta-learning within a neural field framework will significantly enhance the effectiveness of physics-informed neural field solvers in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency. A major challenge in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is the sensitivity of gradient-based training to activation functions, especially when capturing multi-scale phenomena and sharp gradients in solutions. Prior works have explored adaptive activation functions to resolve this issue [4], and meta-learning strategies have been proposed to enable rapid adaptation to unseen boundary and initial conditions [1]. Similarly, models like Physics-informed PointNet (PIPN) have shown promise in generalizing solutions to irregular geometries without retraining, by learning spatial encodings from point-cloud-based domains [5, 6]. However, these approaches often address isolated aspects of the broader PDE solution challenge and struggle with efficiency and accuracy in complex, dynamic systems. 

The research idea builds on this foundation by introducing a hybrid neural field framework that integrates spatially adaptive activation functions—controlled by a learned attention mechanism—with a meta-learning strategy to adapt quickly to new PDE conditions. These innovations aim to achieve three key benefits. First, adaptive activation allows the model to emphasize specific parts of its input space dynamically, enabling the effective resolution of fine-scale features. This is accomplished through an attention mechanism that varies activation slopes or function types based on local coordinate characteristics. Second, meta-learning provides a strategy for optimizing network initialization, allowing the model to swiftly adapt to new boundary or initial conditions via minimal gradient updates without extensive retraining. Third, by embedding these mechanisms within the neural field paradigm for PDE approximation, the proposed methodology aims to enable accurate and computationally efficient simulations across high-dimensional and complex physical systems. 

This work aligns well with the goals outlined in the task description by extending neural fields beyond their current strongholds in visual computing and exploring their utility in computational physics. It addresses specific challenges highlighted in literature, such as the optimization difficulties caused by inadequate activation functions [4] and the inefficiency of training for novel geometries and boundary conditions [5,6]. Additionally, by leveraging the flexibility of neural fields to represent arbitrary spatio-temporal signals (e.g., pressure, velocity), the framework can scale effectively to higher-dimensional systems and complex physics domains. The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide real-time PDE solvers for applications like real-time design iteration in engineering, climate modeling with dynamic boundary conditions, or adaptive control in robotic systems interacting with fluid environments. This proposal aims to explore how neural fields can serve as a powerful tool for computational science by addressing key architectural and optimization challenges systematically.

### Methodology

#### Neural Field Architecture

Our neural field PDE solver will be implemented using coordinate-based neural networks to represent solutions as continuous functions of spatial and temporal inputs. Given a spatio-temporal input $(\mathbf{x}, t) \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ where $\mathbf{x}$ represents spatial coordinates and $t$ is time, the network will output a vector of physical quantities of interest $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}, t) \in \mathbb{R}^m$, such as velocity, pressure, or temperature fields depending on the problem. The core neural field model will adopt a fully connected architecture, inspired by traditional PINN formulations [9], but enhanced with two key components: spatially adaptive activation functions and attention-based adaptive activation control.

Spatially adaptive activation functions (SAAFs), as introduced in [4], allow for learned scaling and transformation of the activation function outputs. Consider a neural network with hidden layers indexed by $ j $. Instead of using a fixed activation function $ \sigma $ at each layer, the output of a linear transformation $ W_j \mathbf{z}_j + \mathbf{b}_j $ will be passed through a learned scaled activation function:

$$ \mathbf{z}_{j+1} = \sigma(a_j (W_j \mathbf{z}_j + \mathbf{b}_j)) $$

where $ \sigma $ denotes a base nonlinear activation (e.g., hyperbolic tangent), $ a_j $ is a scaling factor determined by a learned attention mechanism that considers the spatial coordinate $ \mathbf{x} $ and local PDE properties. The learned scaling factors $ a_j $ can be represented as:

$$ a_j = \text{Attention}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t}) $$

where $ \text{Attention}(\cdot) $ is a dedicated network branch that outputs scaling parameters as a function of position. This approach dynamically adjusts the expressiveness of the neural network based on location, allowing regions with complex features—such as sharp gradients in fluid flow or turbulent interfaces—to activate a broader range of features while maintaining efficient computation in smoother regions.

#### Physics-Informed Loss Function

To ensure the neural network respects the underlying physical model, the PDEs and their boundary conditions will be embedded via a physics-informed loss function during training. Let $ \mathcal{L} $ be a differential operator describing the physics (e.g., $ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}(u) = 0 $) and $ \mathcal{B} $ represent the boundary constraints applied on domain boundaries. The total loss $ \mathcal{J} $ of our framework will combine the PDE constraint, boundary/initial condition errors, and regularization terms:

$$ \mathcal{J} = \lambda_{\mathcal{L}} \mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{L}} + \lambda_{\mathcal{B}} \mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{B}} + \lambda_{\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{C}} $$

Here the terms represent:
- $ \mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{L}} $: PDE residual loss evaluated across a collocation set $ \{ \mathbf{x}_i, t_i \} $ of spatial-temporal inputs.
- $ \mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{B}} $: Loss term computed for boundary and initial condition data $ \{ \mathbf{x}_d, t_d, \mathbf{u}_d(\mathbf{x}_d, t_d) \} $.
- $ \mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{C}} $: Regularization to ensure smoothness and computational stability, including terms such as total variation regularization or weight penalization.

Each term will be calculated as follows. For the PDE loss $ \mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{L}} $, assuming governing equations of the form:

$$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{governing}}(u, \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}, \nabla u, \nabla^2 u, \dots) = 0 $$

We define:

$$ \mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{L}} = \frac{1}{N_{\mathcal{L}}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\mathcal{L}}} \left\| \mathcal{L}_{\text{governing}}\left(u(\mathbf{x}_i, t_i), \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(\mathbf{x}_i, t_i), \nabla u(\mathbf{x}_i, t_i), \nabla^2 u(\mathbf{x}_i, t_i), \dots \right) \right\|^2 $$

where $ N_{\mathcal{L}} $ is the number of collocation points. Similarly, the boundary/initial condition loss $ \mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{B}} $ is computed using available ground truth or reference data:

$$ \mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{B}} = \frac{1}{N_{\mathcal{B}}} \sum_{d=1}^{N_{\mathcal{B}}} \left\| \mathcal{B}_{\text{governing}}\left(u(\mathbf{x}_d, t_d), \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(\mathbf{x}_d, t_d), \nabla u(\mathbf{x}_d, t_d)\right) - \mathbf{u}_d(\mathbf{x}_d, t_d) \right\|^2 $$

Weighting coefficients $ \lambda_{\mathcal{L}}, \lambda_{\mathcal{B}}, \lambda_{\mathcal{C}} $ will balance the relative contributions of each constraint during training.

#### Meta-Learning for Rapid Adaptation

To address the challenge of efficient adaptation to unseen initial or boundary conditions, the framework will incorporate a meta-learning paradigm [2, 3]. This strategy involves training the model on multiple PDE instances with variable boundary conditions, enabling it to generalize solutions effectively through a parameter initialization that facilitates fine-tuning with minimal data.

The meta-learning process will involve:
1. Sampling multiple PDE problems $ \{ \theta_k \} $, where $ \theta_k $ encapsulates specific boundary conditions or physical parameters.
2. For each problem $ \theta_k $, collecting associated collocation datasets $ D_k = \{ (\mathbf{x}_k^{(i)}, t_k^{(i)}, u_k^{(i)}) \}_{i=1}^{N_k} $, including boundary and PDE conditions.
3. During training, the model's meta-optimization updates will be computed based on performance across multiple problems $ \theta_k $, allowing adaptation to any new $ \theta_{\text{new}} $ through a small number of gradient steps.

Mathematically, let $ f_{\mathbf{w}} $ denote the neural field solution parameterized by weights $ \mathbf{w} $, and $ \mathcal{J}_{\theta_k}(\mathbf{w}) $ be the loss function evaluated using problem-specific data. The meta-learning objective is to find an initial weight configuration $ \mathbf{w}_0 $ such that, after a few gradient updates $ \mathbf{w}^{\prime}_k = \mathbf{w}_0 - \nabla \mathcal{J}_{\theta_k}(\mathbf{w}_0) $, the resulting network minimizes the expected loss:

$$ \min_{\mathbf{w}_0} \sum_k \mathcal{J}_{\theta_k}(\mathbf{w}^{\prime}_k) $$

This objective can be optimized via second-order meta-learning strategies such as MAML [2] or variants tailored to PINNs, ensuring the initial weights $ \mathbf{w}_0 $ are well-positioned to allow rapid fine-tuning for new problems.

#### Attention-Based Adaptive Activation Control

Adaptive activation functions [4] enhance the expressiveness and robustness of PINNs by allowing dynamic adjustment of activation properties based on the local characteristics of the PDE solution domain. In our work, we will augment the adaptive activation approach with a spatial attention module to refine activation behavior at a local level. This will be achieved by introducing an attention branch alongside the neural field solution branch, which, given input coordinates $ (\mathbf{x}, t) $, produces a set of scaling coefficients $ \{ a_j \} $ for each hidden neuron in a layer. The attention module will learn to focus on areas with high physical complexity, increasing the steepness of activations in such regions, while relaxing them elsewhere to prevent overfitting.

The attention branch will be trained in parallel to the primary network using domain-specific information or meta-learning-based gradients from the physics-informed loss. This enables the system to adaptively balance local resolution of fine-scale features with global stability of training. This mechanism can also incorporate spatial gradients or curvatures to refine where the adaptive activation is most beneficial.

#### Data Collection Strategy

To evaluate the proposed framework, we will primarily focus on benchmark problems in fluid dynamics and wave propagation, such as the 2D/3D Navier–Stokes equations and the wave equation with variable boundary conditions. These problems were chosen due to their prevalence in applications and the significant challenges they pose for traditional numerical solvers in higher dimensions.

For data collection, we will simulate solutions using classical numerical solvers like finite element methods (FEM) or finite difference methods (FDM) on standard domains (e.g., a unit box with obstacles) for a range of boundary and initial conditions. These simulations will generate reference solutions for validation and provide collocation data with corresponding ground truth values for boundary and domain conditions. Additionally, a sparse dataset of experimental boundary-initial pairs will be collected for meta-learning.

#### Experimental Design

The research will compare the proposed neural field solver against existing PINN baselines and traditional numerical solvers. The experimental design will proceed as follows:

1. **Baseline Comparisons**:
   - We will benchmark against standard PINNs using fixed activation functions (e.g., ReLU or Tanh).
   - We will also compare against existing meta-learning-based solvers such as iFOL [1] and PINN-specific optimization techniques, including those in DeepXDE [10].

2. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Reconstruction Accuracy**: Metrics such as $L_2$ error, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) will be used to measure how closely predicted solutions match reference simulation data.
   - **Efficiency**: Runtime (per epoch) of both training and inference phases, and the number of gradient steps required for convergence on new problems.
   - **Adaptability**: Measured by the model’s performance on unseen initial/boundary condition pairs with minimal fine-tuning steps.
   - **Scalability**: Performance in high-dimensional or highly dynamic (e.g., time-dependent turbulence) settings compared to baseline approaches.

3. **Cross-Validation Strategy**:
   - The dataset will be split into meta-train, meta-validation, and meta-test sets to evaluate performance on held-out boundary conditions.
   - For each dataset, we will simulate various geometries (e.g., obstacles in Navier–Stokes simulations), ensuring that test geometries are significantly different from training inputs to measure generalization across domains.

4. **Grid-Search Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - We will conduct hyperparameter tuning to optimize the number of hidden layers, activation function types, and weighting parameters $ \lambda_{\mathcal{L}}, \lambda_{\mathcal{B}}, \lambda_{\mathcal{C}} $ for the loss components.

#### Baseline Implementations and Software Stack

The experiments will be conducted within an existing PINN framework such as DeepXDE [10], adapted to incorporate spatial attention mechanisms and adaptive activations. We will also implement meta-learning strategies leveraging gradient-based frameworks like Torchmeta [2]. Simulated data for validation will be generated from OpenFOAM or other FEM solvers where appropriate.

By incorporating these components into a single end-to-end neural field framework, this research will explore a novel pathway for improving the fidelity, adaptability, and efficiency of implicit neural networks for solving differential equations in physics and engineering.

### Training Procedure & Implementation Details

#### Training Setup and Optimization Strategy

The proposed neural field PDE solver will be trained using a combination of physics-informed learning and gradient-based meta-learning optimization. The model will be implemented in PyTorch and trained on high-performance GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA A100 or V100) to ensure scalability and robustness in handling large-scale spatio-temporal data. Training will proceed in two distinct phases: (1) meta-training to optimize the base network for rapid adaptation across different boundary conditions or geometries, and (2) problem-specific training to refine the model for particular simulations, leveraging the learned meta-initialization.

For the meta-training phase, we will employ a second-order gradient-based meta-learning algorithm [2], specifically MAML or variants thereof that are robust to ill-conditioned PDE-related gradients. In each meta-iteration, we will sample a mini-batch of PDE problems $ \{ \mathcal{P}_k \} $ from our training dataset—this ensures the model can learn shared representations across different problem types. Each problem will have associated collocation points and boundary/initial condition data, as well as a reference solution computed using traditional numerical methods. During the problem-specific learning step, the model parameters $ \mathbf{w} $ will be updated by minimizing $ \mathcal{J}_{\theta_k} $ for each sampled PDE, resulting in problem-adapted weights $ \mathbf{w}_k^{\prime} $. The meta-learning update will then evaluate the performance of the adapted networks on a held-out batch of validation data and apply gradient corrections to the base initialization $ \mathbf{w}_0 $ to improve downstream adaptation. The training procedure will be formalized as follows:

Let $ \mathcal{D} $ be the set of all PDE problems (e.g., Navier-Stokes simulations). Each $ \mathcal{P}_k \in \mathcal{D} $ is defined by parameters $ \theta_k $ (such as Reynolds number, boundary inflow, or initial velocity distribution). Let $ \mathcal{T}_k^{train}, \mathcal{T}_k^{valid} \subset \mathcal{P}_k $ be sampled from the simulation data for training and validation, respectively. For each meta-training iteration:
1. Randomly sample a batch of PDE problems $ \{ \mathcal{P}_{k_1}, \mathcal{P}_{k_2}, \dots, \mathcal{P}_{k_b} \} $.
2. Compute the gradient-adjusted weights for each problem in batch $ b $:
   $$ \mathbf{w}_{k_i}^{\prime} = \mathbf{w}_0 - \eta_{inner} \nabla_{\mathbf{w}} \mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{P}_{k_i}}(\mathbf{w}_0) $$
   where $ \eta_{inner} $ is the inner-loop learning rate.
3. Calculate the validation loss $ \mathcal{J}_{valid}(\mathbf{w}_{k_i}^{\prime}) $ across the validation dataset $ \mathcal{T}_{k_i}^{valid} $.
4. Apply meta-update:
   $$ \mathbf{w}_0 = \mathbf{w}_0 - \eta_{outer} \sum_{i=1}^{b} \nabla_{\mathbf{w}} \mathcal{J}_{valid}(\mathbf{w}_{k_i}^{\prime}) $$
   where $ \eta_{outer} $ is the outer-loop learning rate.

This training paradigm ensures that $ \mathbf{w}_0 $ is optimized such that one or a few gradient steps on unseen problems yield accurate approximations, minimizing computation for each problem-specific adaptation.

#### Integration of Adaptive Activation Functions

To handle varying solution scales across domain regions, each hidden layer in the coordinate-based neural field will use adaptive activation functions [4]. Instead of fixed activation types (e.g., Tanh), we will incorporate learnable activation scaling parameters $ \{ a_j \} $ as described above. However, we will further refine this by adding spatial attention mechanisms that modulate $ a_j $ based on local coordinate properties, such as position within the domain, proximity to boundaries, or local gradients derived from the PDE.

The spatial attention branch will consist of a lightweight fully connected neural network that takes the coordinate $ (\mathbf{x}, t) $ as input and outputs scaling parameters $ \mathbf{a}_j = (a_j^{(1)}, a_j^{(2)}, \dots) $, where each $ a_j^{(l)} $ corresponds to the activation slope of neuron $ l $ in layer $ j $. The attention-based scaling will be dynamically integrated into the network’s activation functions in real-time during data processing, enabling fine-grained resolution control across the problem domain.

#### Neural Field Training Data

The dataset for training will consist of numerical reference solutions for PDEs sampled over multiple conditions. For the Navier–Stokes equation in fluid dynamics, we will generate 2D and 3D velocity and pressure fields using FEM solvers such as OpenFOAM and FEniCS, for varying Reynolds numbers and obstacle geometries. Similarly, for wave propagation, we will generate collocation datasets with varying boundary constraints using finite difference simulations.

Each simulation dataset will be converted into a set of labeled input-target tuples for physics-informed loss minimization. Inputs will include spatio-temporal coordinates $ (\mathbf{x}, t) $, and targets will be:
- PDE residuals $ \mathcal{L}(u(\mathbf{x}, t), \nabla u(\mathbf{x}, t), \nabla^2 u(\mathbf{x}, t), \dots) $ evaluated for each location (for collocation loss).
- Physical quantities $ u(\mathbf{x}, t) $ for boundary and initial regions constrained by fixed values (e.g., Dirichlet conditions).

The collocation points will be randomly sampled from the domain using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to ensure broad distribution over time and space. Additionally, we will incorporate adaptive collocation point sampling strategies inspired by [2], in which the network dynamically selects regions of high residual error during training as candidates for dense sampling. This ensures the model prioritizes areas of high physics activity, improving multi-scale resolution efficiency.

#### Model Validation and Evaluation

To evaluate the proposed framework, we will compare the performance—both qualitative and quantitative—against the reference simulation outputs from traditional solvers. The primary validation approach will involve computing per-task errors and adaptability metrics after minimal gradient updates, to simulate real-world adaptation scenarios. Evaluation will proceed as follows:

1. **Reference Dataset Selection**:
   - We will divide our collected simulation data into meta-training, meta-validation, and meta-test sets.
   - Meta-training contains a subset of simulations with known boundary, initial, and PDE residuals, used to derive a generalizable initialization for PINN parameters.
   - For meta-validation, we will test adaptation of this base model to newly sampled PDE scenarios and evaluate its convergence and reconstruction accuracy.
   - Finally, the meta-test set will include entirely novel PDE configurations not seen during any stage of training.

2. **Comparison Against Traditional Solvers and PINN Baselines**:
   - Accuracy: We will compute root mean squared error (RMSE), $ L_2 $-norm of residual error, PSNR, and SSIM between the network’s outputs and ground-truth simulations, using these to benchmark accuracy and fidelity.
   - Runtime: We will compare the model’s prediction and training efficiency (e.g., time to converge when adapting to unseen PDEs) to traditional mesh-based solvers.
   - Generalization: By evaluating accuracy and reconstruction fidelity across unseen geometries, we will measure how well the framework handles complex irregular domains.

3. **Implementation and Software Dependencies**:
   - Deep learning computations will be performed using the PyTorch framework.
   - The adaptive activation branch and attention module will be implemented manually in code, leveraging gradient-based optimization through autodifferentiation.
   - The meta-learning framework will utilize Torchmeta or custom second-order gradient code to implement higher-level training strategies.
   - PDE-based data generation and reference will use DeepXDE [10] and OpenFOAM.
   - Visualization and analysis will be supported by tools such as Paraview, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The integration of adaptive activation and meta-learning into our neural field framework presents a highly novel and modular approach for simulating and solving parametric PDEs efficiently. The experimental design will rigorously validate the hypothesis that these enhancements lead to superior accuracy, adaptation speed, and cross-geometry generalization compared to existing PINN-based methods.

### Expected Outcomes

The proposed neural field framework is expected to deliver significant contributions in both methodology and practical applications of physics-informed neural networks for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in engineering and physics contexts. We aim to demonstrate that combining adaptive activation functions and meta-learning techniques will result in a model capable of achieving high-accuracy solutions across diverse PDE problems—particularly those involving complex geometries and dynamic boundary conditions—while enabling rapid adaptation to novel conditions without retraining.

**First**, our approach will introduce a novel neural field-based solver that efficiently captures multi-scale features in PDE solutions. By integrating attention-controlled spatially adaptive activation functions, the network will selectively enhance its representation power in regions of high physical complexity—such as boundary layers in fluid simulations or shock wave transitions—while minimizing computation in smoother regions. This capability will be empirically validated by comparing the model's resolution of fine-scale gradients with that of traditional PINNs using fixed activation schemes.

**Second**, the meta-learning paradigm will enable the model to converge to accurate PDE solutions with minimal fine-tuning steps after initial deployment. We expect the network to adapt to unseen boundary or initial conditions in a few gradient updates (e.g., 50-100 steps), compared to the thousands typically required for standard PINN solvers. This efficiency gain is critical for applications like real-time design exploration and engineering optimization, where iterative simulation is necessary but prohibitively expensive using traditional numerical tools.

**Third**, the neural field framework will show superior generalization across diverse geometries compared to existing PINN-based approaches, which usually require retraining or re-parameterization for each novel domain. The model’s incorporation of spatial attention and adaptive coordinate encoding should allow it to handle both fixed- and irregular-geometry PDE domains without explicit meshing, reducing preprocessing complexity and computational cost.

We anticipate that the framework will perform well on benchmark PDE problems from fluid dynamics and wave propagation. Specifically:
- **Navier-Stokes simulations**: The model should capture velocity and pressure distributions in fluid systems with Reynolds numbers ranging from laminar to turbulent flows. Performance will be measured using $ L_2 $ error metrics and visual comparison against FEM reference simulations.
- **Wave equation simulations**: The solver must accurately depict wave propagation, including reflections and interference patterns, under variable boundary conditions. We will evaluate both local accuracy (e.g., pointwise error) and global structure preservation (e.g., phase and energy error across the domain).

These results will contribute to the broader literature by bridging critical limitations in PINNs, such as convergence instability and poor resolution at multi-scale features [4], and introducing efficient adaptation strategies for diverse boundary settings. The integration of these elements within the neural field paradigm provides a generalizable and scalable model for physics-based simulations.

In terms of theoretical implications, the project will demonstrate how learned activation function scaling, guided by spatial coordinates and local PDE properties, can improve the approximation power of neural networks for physics modeling. Similarly, from an applied perspective, the framework’s efficiency in solving high-dimensional PDE systems will position it as a competitive alternative to classical solvers for real-world tasks like design optimization and predictive maintenance in engineering. The outcomes of this study will provide a foundation for expanding implicit neural representations into broader computational physics applications, aligning with the workshop's goals of interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted domains.

### Impact and Broader Implications

The proposed neural field framework for solving PDEs is expected to have substantial theoretical and practical impacts on both the PINN and broader machine learning communities. **Theoretically**, it advances the understanding of activation function dynamics in physics-informed deep learning. By integrating spatially adaptive activation schemes with attention-based control and meta-learning, it provides a new perspective on how architectural flexibility can be combined with optimization robustness, addressing known limitations of PINNs such as poor convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices [4]. This work will contribute to the development of PINN methodologies by formalizing strategies for dynamic activation function selection, a topic that remains an active area in deep learning applied to differential equations.

**Practically**, the framework will significantly reduce the time and computational costs associated with PDE solving in complex and dynamic systems. Current state-of-the-art numerical solvers typically require reinitializing the mesh-based structure for each new boundary condition or geometry. The model avoids this need, allowing immediate deployment of problem-specific adaptations with minimal gradient updates, reducing both the time and memory footprint of simulations. This makes it particularly valuable for applications such as real-time fluid control, multi-scale weather prediction, and large-scale climate modeling. For example, the framework can be used to simulate the impact of dynamic boundary constraints on atmospheric phenomena, enabling rapid updates to weather forecasts without requiring complete retraining. Similarly, applications in computational biology—such as modeling tissue growth or biochemical dynamics—can benefit from this scalable and efficient model.

**Interdisciplinary relevance** is another core impact of the framework. The ability of neural fields to represent signals in arbitrary dimensions aligns well with problems in robotics, computational physics, and climate science. In robotics, this framework could support control algorithms by solving real-time physics constraints (e.g., simulating liquid interactions or dynamic structures such as cloth movement), enabling more adaptive motion planning systems [7]. In climate modeling, where spatio-temporal simulations often span multiple scales—from global wind patterns to small-scale oceanic turbulence—our approach will allow seamless adaptation to domain changes while maintaining computational efficiency. This could enhance simulations of planetary climate systems and accelerate the study of climate change effects. For **future research directions**, our framework provides insights into the development of hybrid neural-numerical methods. By incorporating learned activation control and meta-learning into a continuous coordinate-based solution paradigm, future studies could explore how PINNs can be made robust to ill-posed problems or how implicit neural fields can integrate with data assimilation techniques in real-time systems. Additionally, the integration of domain-specific inductive biases (e.g., symmetries, conservation laws) into adaptive activation functions remains an open research frontier, and this framework serves as a foundation for further innovations in structured learning.

This project directly contributes to the **ICLR workshop’s goals**, particularly in fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between machine learning and diverse application domains. It addresses the question of scalability and adaptability in neural fields by demonstrating how attention mechanisms and meta-learning can enhance traditional PINNs. By extending neural fields beyond visual computing and into computational physics and climate science, it opens new pathways for research in implicit neural modeling, potentially inspiring further work in neural optimization, physics-informed generative modeling, or real-time PDE simulation for autonomous systems [7].
