# Neural Fields for Weather Forecasting: A High-Resolution Approach

## Motivation
Traditional weather forecasting methods face limitations in resolution, computational efficiency, and handling complex atmospheric dynamics. Neural fields offer a promising alternative for climate science by implicitly representing continuous weather variables across space and time. Current weather prediction models either sacrifice resolution for computational feasibility or require massive computational resources. A neural field approach could provide high-resolution forecasts with lower computational overhead while capturing complex non-linear atmospheric patterns more effectively than existing methods.

## Main Idea
The proposed research develops a coordinate-based neural network architecture specifically designed for weather forecasting. The model takes as input spatial coordinates (latitude, longitude, altitude) and time, and outputs multiple weather variables (temperature, pressure, humidity, wind vectors) at arbitrary resolutions. The architecture incorporates physics-informed constraints by embedding basic atmospheric physics equations as soft constraints in the loss function. We propose a multi-scale encoding of input coordinates to capture both local weather phenomena and large-scale patterns. For training, we utilize reanalysis datasets (ERA5, MERRA-2) combined with satellite observations to provide ground truth. The expected outcome is a weather prediction system that produces continuous, physically consistent forecasts at arbitrary resolutions with reduced computational requirements compared to traditional numerical weather prediction models. This approach bridges machine learning and climate science by leveraging the implicit continuous representation capabilities of neural fields.
