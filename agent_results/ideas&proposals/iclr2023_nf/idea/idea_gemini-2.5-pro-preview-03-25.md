**Title:** Semantic Querying of Neural Fields via Auxiliary Prediction Heads

**Motivation:** Standard neural fields excel at representing complex signals implicitly, but extracting high-level semantic or geometric information often requires costly post-processing or separate models. This hinders their direct application in downstream tasks needing structured understanding, such as scene graph generation, robotic interaction planning, or material-aware physics simulation.

**Main Idea:** We propose augmenting neural field architectures (e.g., coordinate-based MLPs) with auxiliary prediction heads. Trained concurrently with the primary field representation (e.g., density, color, flow vector) using relevant supervision (e.g., semantic labels, material properties, part segmentations), these heads learn to directly map input coordinates and/or intermediate MLP features to specific high-level attributes. For instance, alongside predicting colour/density for a 3D scene point, auxiliary heads could predict its object class label or material type. This approach allows direct, continuous querying of semantic or physical properties throughout the field's domain. Expected outcomes include enriched neural representations usable for fine-grained analysis and control, enabling more direct integration into complex reasoning pipelines without separate interpretation steps.
