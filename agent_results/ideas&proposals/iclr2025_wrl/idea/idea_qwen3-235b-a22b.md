1. **Title**: Morphology-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Universal Embodied AI Policies  

2. **Motivation**: Current robotic systems rely on morphology-specific training, limiting their versatility and data efficiency. To achieve human-level robustness across diverse tasks and robotic "bodies" (arms, drones, quadrupeds), we need policies that generalize across arbitrary morphologies. This approach would eliminate retraining overhead and unlock rapid deployment in dynamic environments, bridging the gap between specialized hardware and general embodied intelligence.  

3. **Main Idea**: Propose a meta-learning framework where policies factorize sensor inputs and morphology descriptors, using adaptive layers conditioned on structural parameters (e.g., limb lengths, degrees of freedom). Pre-train in simulation across diverse morphologies to develop a prior that infers optimal policies from morphology metadata alone. A hierarchical architecture separates core perception/decision-making modules (shared across forms) from dynamic modulator networks (morphology-specific layers). Adapters are fine-tuned using minimal real-world data with domain adaptation. Expected outcomes include a 70% reduction in task-specific training data per morphology and cross-form zero-shot adaptation. Impact: Universal policies enabling immediate deployment on novel robotic systems, accelerating applications in healthcare, disaster response, and industry. Key innovations involve morphology-conditioned meta-control and shared-skeletal representation learning.
