**Research Proposal**  
**Title**: Bridging the Reality Gap: Self-Adaptive Sim-to-Real Transfer Learning for Robust Robot Skills  

---

### 1. Introduction  
**Background**  
Modern robotics faces a fundamental challenge in deploying simulation-trained policies to real-world environments due to the "reality gap"â€”systematic discrepancies between simulated and physical dynamics. While domain randomization and meta-learning have improved robustness, these methods often require manual tuning, assume static environments, or trade off adaptation speed for generalization. Recent works (e.g., Fast Online Adaptive Neural MPC [arXiv:2504.16369], AdaptSim [arXiv:2302.04903]) highlight the promise of online adaptation but lack unified frameworks for continuous, uncertainty-aware adaptation across diverse tasks.  

**Research Objectives**  
This project proposes a self-adaptive sim-to-real transfer framework to enable robots to:  
1. **Actively identify** real-world dynamics through online interaction.  
2. **Meta-learn adaptable policies** for rapid reconfiguration.  
3. **Modulate control strategies** based on uncertainty quantification.  

**Significance**  
By unifying system identification, meta-learning, and uncertainty-aware control, this work aims to advance robotic adaptability in unstructured environments. Successful deployment could reduce reliance on exhaustive real-world training data and manual tuning, accelerating the development of robots capable of human-level versatility in tasks like household assistance and industrial automation.

### 2. Methodology  
**Research Design**  
The framework comprises three interconnected modules (Fig. 1) validated on manipulation tasks requiring precise force control (e.g., peg insertion, liquid pouring).

#### **2.1 Neural System Identification Module**  
**Data Collection**  
- **Simulation Data**: Generate diverse trajectories using parameterized physics models:  
  $$ s_{t+1} = f_\theta(s_t, a_t) + \epsilon $$  
  where $s_t$, $a_t$ are state-action pairs and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ models process noise.  
- **Real-World Data**: Collect online interaction sequences during deployment via proprioception and vision sensors.  

**Dynamics Learning**  
Train a probabilistic neural network $f_\phi$ to predict residual dynamics errors between simulation and reality:  
$$ \Delta s_{t+1} = f_\phi(s_t, a_t; \phi) $$  
Online updates minimize the temporal consistency loss:  
$$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{dyn}} = \mathbb{E}_{(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1})}\left[ \| f_\phi(s_t,a_t) - \Delta s_{t+1} \|^2 \right] $$  
Parameters $\phi$ are updated via recursive least squares for real-time efficiency.  

#### **2.2 Meta-Learning Architecture**  
**Pretraining Phase**  
Train a base policy $\pi_\omega$ using Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) across $N$ simulation environments with varying dynamics $\{\theta_i\}_{i=1}^N$:  
$$ \min_\omega \sum_{i=1}^N \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}\left( \pi_{\omega'_i} \right), \quad \omega'_i = \omega - \alpha \nabla_\omega \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(\pi_\omega; \theta_i) $$  
where $\alpha$ is the adaptation step size.  

**Online Adaptation**  
During deployment, adapt $\pi_\omega$ using trajectories $\tau = \{(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})\}$:  
$$ \omega' \leftarrow \omega - \beta \nabla_\omega \mathcal{L}_{\text{adapt}}(\pi_\omega; \tau) $$  
The adaptation loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{adapt}}$ combines task reward $r$ and dynamics consistency:  
$$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{adapt}} = -\mathbb{E}_\tau\left[ \sum r(s_t,a_t) \right] + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{dyn}} $$  

#### **2.3 Uncertainty-Aware Control Strategy**  
**Uncertainty Quantification**  
Compute epistemic uncertainty $u_t$ using dropout-based Bayesian inference on $f_\phi$:  
$$ u_t = \text{Var}\left( \{ f_\phi(s_t,a_t; \phi^{(k)}) \}_{k=1}^K \right) $$  
where $\phi^{(k
