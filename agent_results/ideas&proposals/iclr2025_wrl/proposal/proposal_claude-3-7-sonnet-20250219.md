# Bridging the Reality Gap: Self-Adaptive Sim-to-Real Transfer Learning for Human-Level Robot Skills

## 1. Introduction

### Background
Robots with human-level abilities require mastery of complex manipulation skills, robust adaptation to dynamic environments, and efficient learning from limited experiences. Despite remarkable advances in robot learning and control algorithms, a persistent challenge in deploying intelligent robots in the real world is the "reality gap" - the discrepancy between simulated training environments and physical reality. This gap arises from the difficulty of accurately modeling complex physics, material properties, contact dynamics, and environmental variations in simulation. When policies trained in simulation are transferred to real robots, performance often degrades significantly due to these modeling discrepancies.

Current approaches to sim-to-real transfer broadly fall into three categories: domain randomization (Tobin et al., 2017), which trains policies on randomized simulation parameters to improve robustness; domain adaptation (Bousmalis et al., 2018), which learns mappings between simulation and reality; and system identification (Yu et al., 2019), which estimates physical parameters to improve simulation fidelity. While these methods have shown promise, they typically require extensive manual tuning, sacrifice performance for robustness, or fail to adapt to unexpected changes during deployment.

Recent work by Ren et al. (2023) introduced task-driven simulation adaptation for sim-to-real transfer (AdaptSim), which optimizes for task performance rather than just matching dynamics. Similarly, Kim et al. (2023) proposed a unified framework integrating active exploration with uncertainty-aware deployment. However, existing approaches still struggle with continuous online adaptation to changing conditions and efficient utilization of real-world experiences for progressive improvement.

### Research Objectives
This research aims to develop a self-adaptive sim-to-real transfer framework that continuously refines the alignment between simulation and reality during deployment, enabling robots to achieve human-level performance across diverse tasks. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Design a neural system identification module that actively learns and updates physical dynamics models from real-world interaction data.
2. Develop a meta-learning architecture that optimizes policies for rapid adaptation rather than fixed performance in a single environment.
3. Create an uncertainty-aware control strategy that automatically modulates exploration-exploitation based on confidence in the current model.
4. Integrate these components into a unified framework that progressively narrows the reality gap through experience, maintaining high performance while adapting to environmental changes, hardware degradation, or novel situations.

### Significance
This research addresses a fundamental limitation in current robot learning approaches - the inability to efficiently adapt simulation-trained skills to real-world conditions without extensive human intervention. By enabling robots to self-adapt their models and policies during deployment, we can dramatically improve their versatility and robustness in unstructured environments.

The proposed framework has several significant advantages over existing approaches:

1. **Continuous Learning**: Unlike traditional domain randomization approaches that front-load all adaptation before deployment, our system continues learning online, enabling progressive improvement through experience.
2. **Uncertainty Awareness**: By explicitly modeling uncertainty, the system can make informed decisions about when to exploit current knowledge versus gather new information.
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Meta-learning enables rapid adaptation with minimal data and computation, making the approach suitable for real-time robotics applications.
4. **Generalizability**: The framework is task-agnostic and can be applied to diverse robotic skills requiring precise physical interactions.

This research aligns with the workshop's focus on developing robots with human-level abilities by addressing a key bottleneck in transferring simulation-trained skills to real-world environments. The proposed approach will enable robots to perform complex manipulation tasks more robustly, adapting to environmental variations similarly to how humans adjust their motor skills across contexts.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed self-adaptive sim-to-real transfer framework consists of three integrated components: neural system identification, meta-learning for rapid adaptation, and uncertainty-aware control. The overall architecture is shown in Figure 1.

### 2.1 Neural System Identification

The neural system identification module aims to learn and continuously update a model of the robot's dynamics based on real-world interaction data. Following recent advances in neural system identification (Mei et al., 2025), we formulate the dynamics model as:

$$\hat{s}_{t+1} = f_\phi(s_t, a_t) = f_{nom}(s_t, a_t) + f_\Delta(s_t, a_t; \phi)$$

where $s_t$ is the state at time $t$, $a_t$ is the action, $f_{nom}$ is a nominal dynamics model based on prior knowledge, and $f_\Delta$ is a neural network with parameters $\phi$ that learns the residual dynamics not captured by the nominal model.

For the neural network architecture, we employ a probabilistic ensemble approach inspired by Kim et al. (2023), consisting of $N$ neural networks that capture epistemic uncertainty in dynamics prediction:

$$f_\Delta(s_t, a_t; \phi) = \{f_\Delta^i(s_t, a_t; \phi_i)\}_{i=1}^N$$

Each network outputs a Gaussian distribution over the next state:

$$f_\Delta^i(s_t, a_t; \phi_i) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_i(s_t, a_t), \Sigma_i(s_t, a_t))$$

The networks are trained to minimize the negative log-likelihood of observed transitions:

$$\mathcal{L}_{NLL}(\phi_i) = \frac{1}{2}(s_{t+1} - \hat{s}_{t+1}^i)^T\Sigma_i^{-1}(s_t, a_t)(s_{t+1} - \hat{s}_{t+1}^i) + \frac{1}{2}\log|\Sigma_i(s_t, a_t)| + \text{const}$$

To promote diversity among ensemble members, we employ random initialization and bootstrap different subsets of the training data for each network.

#### Online Adaptation Procedure
During deployment, we collect real-world transition data $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$ and update the dynamics model using gradient descent:

1. Initialize a buffer $\mathcal{D}$ with real-world transitions
2. For each update iteration:
   a. Sample a mini-batch $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{D}$
   b. Update each network's parameters: $\phi_i \leftarrow \phi_i - \alpha \nabla_{\phi_i} \mathcal{L}_{NLL}(\phi_i)$

The update frequency is adaptive based on the measured prediction error, with more frequent updates when the model's predictions significantly deviate from observed transitions.

### 2.2 Meta-Learning for Rapid Adaptation

The meta-learning component optimizes policies for quick adaptation rather than fixed performance in a single environment. We employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) (Finn et al., 2017) extended to handle the robot control setting as proposed by He et al. (2024).

Let $\mathcal{T} = \{T_1, T_2, ..., T_n\}$ be a distribution of tasks where each task $T_i$ corresponds to a different simulated environment with varying physical parameters. The meta-learning objective is to find policy parameters $\theta$ that can be quickly adapted to any new task with minimal data:

$$\min_\theta \mathbb{E}_{T_i \sim \mathcal{T}} \left[ \mathcal{L}_{T_i}(U_{T_i}(\theta)) \right]$$

where $U_{T_i}(\theta)$ is the task-specific parameter update operator and $\mathcal{L}_{T_i}$ is the task-specific loss function.

For policy representation, we use a neural network parameterized by $\theta$ that maps states to actions:

$$\pi_\theta(s_t) = a_t$$

The MAML update operator for a specific task $T_i$ is defined as:

$$U_{T_i}(\theta) = \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{T_i}(\theta)$$

where $\alpha$ is the adaptation learning rate.

In the context of reinforcement learning, the loss function $\mathcal{L}_{T_i}(\theta)$ is the negative expected return:

$$\mathcal{L}_{T_i}(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim p(\tau|\theta, T_i)} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{H} \gamma^t r_t \right]$$

where $\tau = (s_0, a_0, r_0, ..., s_H, a_H, r_H)$ is a trajectory, $p(\tau|\theta, T_i)$ is the distribution of trajectories induced by policy $\pi_\theta$ in task $T_i$, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $r_t$ is the reward at time $t$.

#### Meta-Training Procedure
1. Sample batch of tasks $\{T_i\}_{i=1}^B$ from $\mathcal{T}$
2. For each task $T_i$:
   a. Sample trajectories $\tau_i$ using policy $\pi_\theta$
   b. Compute adapted parameters: $\theta_i' = \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{T_i}(\theta)$
   c. Sample new trajectories $\tau_i'$ using adapted policy $\pi_{\theta_i'}$
3. Update meta-parameters: $\theta \leftarrow \theta - \beta \nabla_\theta \sum_{i=1}^B \mathcal{L}_{T_i}(\theta_i')$

The task distribution $\mathcal{T}$ is constructed by varying physical parameters in simulation, such as friction coefficients, object masses, actuator strengths, and sensor noise. This creates a diverse set of environments that challenge the policy to adapt quickly to different dynamics.

### 2.3 Uncertainty-Aware Control Strategy

The uncertainty-aware control component uses the uncertainty estimates from the neural system identification module to guide exploration and exploitation during deployment. Inspired by Wilson et al. (2025) and Green et al. (2024), we formulate a model predictive control (MPC) framework that accounts for epistemic uncertainty.

The control strategy involves solving the following optimization problem at each time step:

$$a_t^* = \arg\max_{a_t} \mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1:t+H}} \left[ \sum_{k=t}^{t+H-1} r(s_k, a_k) \right] - \lambda \mathcal{U}(s_{t:t+H}, a_{t:t+H-1})$$

where $H$ is the planning horizon, $r(s_k, a_k)$ is the reward function, $\mathcal{U}$ is an uncertainty penalty, and $\lambda$ is a weighting parameter that balances exploitation (maximizing reward) with exploration (reducing uncertainty).

The uncertainty penalty is computed using the Jensen-Renyi divergence between the ensemble predictions, as proposed by Kim et al. (2023):

$$\mathcal{U}(s_{t:t+H}, a_{t:t+H-1}) = \sum_{k=t}^{t+H-1} JR_\alpha\left(\{p_i(s_{k+1}|s_k, a_k)\}_{i=1}^N\right)$$

where $JR_\alpha$ is the Jensen-Renyi divergence of order $\alpha$:

$$JR_\alpha\left(\{p_i\}_{i=1}^N\right) = \frac{1}{\alpha-1}\log\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \int p_i(x)^\alpha dx\right) - \frac{1}{\alpha-1}\log\left(\int \left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N p_i(x)\right)^\alpha dx\right)$$

This uncertainty measure captures the disagreement among ensemble members, providing a principled way to guide exploration towards regions of high epistemic uncertainty.

The weighting parameter $\lambda$ is adjusted dynamically based on task performance:

$$\lambda_t = \lambda_{base} \cdot \exp\left(\beta \cdot \frac{R_{target} - R_{current}}{R_{target}}\right)$$

where $\lambda_{base}$ is a base weight, $\beta$ is a scaling factor, $R_{target}$ is the target performance, and $R_{current}$ is the current performance. This adaptive weighting increases exploration when performance is below target and focuses on exploitation when performance is satisfactory.

### 2.4 Integrated Framework and Implementation

The three components described above are integrated into a unified framework with the following workflow:

1. **Pre-training Phase**:
   - Train the initial dynamics model ensemble using simulated data
   - Meta-train the policy using MAML across a distribution of simulated environments
   - Initialize the exploration parameter $\lambda$

2. **Deployment Phase** (iterative):
   - Observe current state $s_t$
   - Use uncertainty-aware MPC to select action $a_t^*$
   - Execute action and observe next state $s_{t+1}$
   - Update dynamics model using collected transition $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$
   - Adapt policy parameters using MAML update with recent experiences
   - Adjust exploration parameter $\lambda$ based on task performance

3. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Periodically consolidate learned dynamics and policy updates
   - Transfer knowledge across tasks when appropriate

The framework is implemented using PyTorch for neural network training and MuJoCo for physics simulation. Real-world experiments will be conducted using a 7-DOF robotic arm equipped with a gripper, RGB-D cameras, and tactile sensors.

### 2.5 Experimental Design and Evaluation

We will evaluate our framework on a set of challenging manipulation tasks that require precise physical interactions:

1. **Peg-in-hole insertion**: Inserting a peg into a hole with tight tolerances
2. **In-hand manipulation**: Reorienting objects within the gripper
3. **Dynamic catching**: Catching objects with varying trajectories
4. **Assembly tasks**: Connecting parts with different connection mechanisms
5. **Fabric manipulation**: Folding and arranging deformable objects

For each task, we will compare our approach against the following baselines:
- Domain randomization without online adaptation
- System identification without uncertainty awareness
- Model-free reinforcement learning with real-world fine-tuning
- AdaptSim (Ren et al., 2023)
- Uncertainty-Aware Control (Kim et al., 2023)

Performance metrics include:
- **Success rate**: Percentage of successful task completions
- **Adaptation time**: Number of real-world interactions needed to achieve reliable performance
- **Robustness**: Performance under environmental variations (lighting, object properties, disturbances)
- **Sample efficiency**: Performance as a function of real-world interaction data
- **Transfer performance**: Ability to transfer learned skills to novel variants of the tasks

To assess the contribution of each component, we will conduct ablation studies by removing or replacing individual components of our framework. Additionally, we will analyze the learned dynamics models and adapted policies to gain insights into how the system handles different aspects of the reality gap.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

The successful implementation of our self-adaptive sim-to-real transfer framework is expected to yield several significant outcomes:

1. **Improved Adaptation Efficiency**: We anticipate that our approach will reduce the number of real-world interactions required for successful sim-to-real transfer by 50-70% compared to current methods, as measured by the number of trials needed to achieve a target success rate on manipulation tasks.

2. **Enhanced Robustness**: The system is expected to maintain high performance (>85% success rate) across variations in environmental conditions, object properties, and hardware characteristics without requiring manual re-tuning.

3. **Continuous Improvement**: Unlike traditional methods that plateau after initial deployment, our framework should demonstrate progressive improvement over extended operation periods, with performance metrics continuing to improve as more real-world data is collected.

4. **Generalizable Learning**: The meta-learning component is expected to enable rapid adaptation to novel task variants with minimal additional training, demonstrating the system's ability to leverage prior knowledge for new challenges.

5. **Principled Uncertainty Management**: We anticipate that the uncertainty-aware control strategy will effectively balance exploration and exploitation, leading to more efficient learning in regions of high uncertainty while maintaining reliable performance in well-modeled situations.

6. **Scalable Framework**: The approach should scale effectively to more complex manipulation tasks and multi-step sequences, demonstrating the framework's potential for application to increasingly sophisticated robotic skills.
