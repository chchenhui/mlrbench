# **Research Proposal: Self-Adaptive Sim-to-Real Transfer via Online Meta-Learning, System Identification, and Uncertainty-Aware Control**

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The quest for robots with human-level physical abilities, capable of performing complex tasks like cooking or tidying in unstructured environments, is a central theme in contemporary robotics research, as highlighted by the ICLR 2025 Robot Learning Workshop. Simulation offers a safe, scalable, and cost-effective platform for training robot control policies using reinforcement learning (RL) and other machine learning techniques. However, translating policies trained purely in simulation to the physical world remains a significant hurdle due to the inherent "reality gap" – the discrepancies between simulated physics, sensor models, and actuator dynamics compared to their real-world counterparts (Kadian et al., 2020).

Traditional approaches to bridging this gap often rely on extensive domain randomization (DR) (Tobin et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2018) or system identification (SysID) performed offline (Abbeel et al., 2006). While DR can produce robust policies, it often achieves this by sacrificing peak performance, effectively finding a lowest common denominator policy across a wide range of simulated variations. Offline SysID methods attempt to create a highly accurate simulation model but struggle with dynamics that change over time (e.g., due to wear and tear, varying payloads, or environmental changes) and require significant effort for re-calibration. These limitations hinder the deployment of robots capable of sustained autonomous operation in dynamic, real-world settings.

Recent advancements have explored online adaptation techniques. Some methods focus on adapting dynamics models online (e.g., Mei et al., 2025; Johnson & Lee, 2024; He et al., 2024), while others leverage meta-learning to train policies that can adapt quickly to new conditions (e.g., Finn et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2023; Martinez & White, 2023; Doe & Smith, 2023). Additionally, incorporating uncertainty estimation into control strategies has shown promise for improving robustness and guiding exploration (e.g., Kim et al., 2023; Davis & Brown, 2024; Green & Black, 2024). However, these components are often investigated in isolation. A unified framework that integrates continuous online system identification, meta-learning specifically for rapid online adaptation, and uncertainty-aware control to manage the adaptation process is still lacking. Such a framework is crucial for developing robots that not only cross the initial reality gap but also maintain high performance as the real world inevitably diverges from the initial simulation assumptions over time (Wilson & Thompson, 2025).

### 1.2 Research Objectives
This research proposes a novel self-adaptive sim-to-real transfer framework designed to enable robots to continuously learn and adapt their simulation-trained skills during real-world deployment without human intervention. The primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Unified Adaptive Framework:** To design and implement an integrated system combining:
    *   A neural network-based online system identification module that estimates residual dynamics (differences between simulation and reality) using real-time interaction data.
    *   A meta-reinforcement learning algorithm specifically tailored to train policies optimized for fast adaptation to variations in dynamics encountered *during* deployment.
    *   An uncertainty-aware control mechanism that leverages estimates of model uncertainty to dynamically balance exploration (gathering informative data for SysID) and exploitation (maximizing task performance).

2.  **Enable Continuous Online Adaptation:** To demonstrate that the proposed framework allows a robot, initially trained in simulation, to continuously refine its policy and dynamics model online, effectively narrowing the reality gap throughout its operational lifetime.

3.  **Achieve Robustness without Sacrificing Performance:** To show that the self-adaptive approach leads to policies that are robust to unforeseen changes in dynamics (e.g., varying object properties, changing friction, wear and tear) while maintaining high task performance, overcoming the typical robustness-performance trade-off seen in standard domain randomization.

4.  **Validate on Complex Manipulation Tasks:** To evaluate the framework's effectiveness on challenging robotic manipulation tasks requiring precise physical interaction, comparing its performance, adaptation speed, and data efficiency against state-of-the-art sim-to-real baselines.

### 1.3 Significance
Addressing the reality gap through continuous online adaptation holds significant potential for advancing robot capabilities. This research is significant for several reasons:

1.  **Enhanced Robot Autonomy and Reliability:** By enabling robots to adapt to changing real-world conditions autonomously, this work paves the way for more reliable and long-term deployments in complex environments like homes, hospitals, and factories, directly contributing to the goal of achieving human-level robustness and versatility.
2.  **Improved Sim-to-Real Efficiency:** Compared to exhaustive domain randomization or manual offline system identification, the proposed online adaptive approach aims for greater data efficiency by focusing adaptation efforts on the *actual* discrepancies encountered in the real world.
3.  **Contribution to ML for Robotics:** This project integrates cutting-edge ML techniques (online learning, meta-learning, uncertainty quantification) into a cohesive framework tailored for robotics, potentially yielding insights applicable to broader AI domains dealing with model mismatch and online adaptation challenges.
4.  **Alignment with Workshop Goals:** The focus on robust performance in dynamic environments, bridging simulation and reality, and developing novel ML algorithms for robot control directly aligns with the key themes and specific areas of interest outlined by the ICLR 2025 Robot Learning Workshop. Success in this research would demonstrate a concrete step towards robots possessing more general physical capabilities.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Overall Framework
We propose a closed-loop adaptive control system where the robot continuously interacts with its environment, learns from this interaction, and adapts its behavior. The core components interact as follows (see Figure 1 - conceptual):

*   **Interaction Loop:** The robot executes actions $a_t$ based on its current policy $\pi$ given state $s_t$. It observes the next state $s_{t+1}$ and receives reward $r_t$.
*   **Data Collection:** Real-world transition tuples $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})_{real}$ are collected into a buffer.
*   **Online System Identification:** The neural SysID module uses recent real-world data to update its estimate of the residual dynamics $\Delta f$, representing the mismatch between the base simulator $f_{sim}$ and reality $f_{real}$.
*   **Policy Adaptation:** The meta-learned policy $\pi_{\theta_{pol}}$ is rapidly adapted using the updated dynamics estimate $\hat{f} = f_{sim} + \Delta \hat{f}_{\theta_{dyn}}$ to yield an adapted policy $\pi'_{\theta'_{pol}}$.
*   **Uncertainty-Aware Action Selection:** The control module selects the next action $a_{t+1}$ using the adapted policy $\pi'$, potentially modulated by uncertainty estimates derived from the SysID module to guide exploration.

### 2.2 Component Details

**2.2.1 Online Neural System Identification Module**

*   **Objective:** To learn the discrepancy between the simulator's dynamics $f_{sim}(s, a)$ and the real-world dynamics $f_{real}(s, a)$, represented as a residual function $\Delta f(s, a)$. The predicted real-world next state is $\hat{s}_{t+1} = f_{sim}(s_t, a_t) + \Delta \hat{f}_{\theta_{dyn}}(s_t, a_t)$, where $\theta_{dyn}$ are the parameters of the neural network.
*   **Model Architecture:** We will employ a probabilistic ensemble of feedforward neural networks (inspired by Chua et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2023). Each network $i$ in the ensemble, $\Delta \hat{f}_{\theta_{dyn}^{(i)}}(s, a)$, predicts the residual dynamics. The ensemble structure naturally provides a measure of epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty) through the variance of predictions across ensemble members.
*   **Learning Algorithm:** The parameters $\theta_{dyn}^{(i)}$ of each network $i$ will be updated online using stochastic gradient descent on a loss function that minimizes the prediction error on recent real-world transitions stored in the buffer $D$. A suitable loss function is the Mean Squared Error (MSE):
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{dyn}^{(i)} = \frac{1}{|B|} \sum_{(s_j, a_j, s_{j+1}) \in B} || s_{j+1} - (f_{sim}(s_j, a_j) + \Delta \hat{f}_{\theta_{dyn}^{(i)}}(s_j, a_j)) ||^2 $$
    where $B \subset D$ is a mini-batch of recent transitions. Updates can be performed frequently using small batches to maintain responsiveness. Techniques like target networks or conservative updates might be employed for stability, drawing inspiration from online learning methods (He et al., 2024).
*   **Uncertainty Quantification:** Epistemic uncertainty $U(s, a)$ will be estimated as the variance or disagreement among the predictions of the ensemble members:
    $$ U(s, a) \approx \text{Var}_{i} \left( \Delta \hat{f}_{\theta_{dyn}^{(i)}}(s, a) \right) $$
    This uncertainty measure will inform the uncertainty-aware control module.

**2.2.2 Meta-Learning for Rapid Adaptation**

*   **Objective:** To pre-train a policy $\pi_{\theta_{pol}}$ in simulation such that it can be rapidly adapted to the specific dynamics $\hat{f} = f_{sim} + \Delta \hat{f}_{\theta_{dyn}}$ estimated online by the SysID module. This contrasts with standard RL, which optimizes for a single environment, or standard DR, which optimizes average performance over many environments.
*   **Algorithm:** We will adapt a gradient-based meta-RL algorithm like Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) (Finn et al., 2017) or its variants (e.g., FO-MAML for efficiency, inspired by Mei et al., 2025; Martinez & White, 2023).
    *   **Meta-Training (Simulation):** During meta-training in simulation, we sample tasks $\mathcal{T}_k$, where each task corresponds to a specific dynamics variation (e.g., different friction, mass, potentially modeled using simulated residual dynamics functions). For each task $\mathcal{T}_k$ with dynamics $f_k$:
        1.  Sample trajectories using the current policy $\pi_{\theta_{pol}}$.
        2.  Compute an adapted policy $\pi_{\theta'_{pol, k}}$ by taking one or few gradient steps on a policy performance objective (e.g., expected return) using data generated under dynamics $f_k$. For example, using Policy Gradient:
            $$ \theta'_{pol, k} = \theta_{pol} + \alpha \nabla_{\theta_{pol}} J_k(\pi_{\theta_{pol}}) $$
            where $J_k$ is the performance objective under dynamics $f_k$.
        3.  Update the meta-parameters $\theta_{pol}$ by optimizing the performance of the *adapted* policies across tasks:
            $$ \theta_{pol} \leftarrow \theta_{pol} - \beta \nabla_{\theta_{pol}} \sum_{k} J_k(\pi_{\theta'_{pol, k}}) $$
    *   **Online Adaptation (Real World):** During deployment, when the SysID module provides an updated dynamics estimate $\hat{f} = f_{sim} + \Delta \hat{f}_{\theta_{dyn}}$, we perform one or few adaptation steps on the meta-trained policy $\pi_{\theta_{pol}}$ using this estimated dynamics $\hat{f}$ (potentially within a planning framework like MPC, or via direct policy gradients computed using imagined rollouts under $\hat{f}$).
        $$ \theta'_{pol} = \theta_{pol} + \alpha \nabla_{\theta_{pol}} J_{\hat{f}}(\pi_{\theta_{pol}}) $$
        The resulting adapted policy $\pi'_{\theta'_{pol}}$ is used for action selection. This adaptation process repeats as $\hat{f}$ is updated.

**2.2.3 Uncertainty-Aware Control Strategy**

*   **Objective:** To leverage the dynamics model uncertainty $U(s, a)$ derived from the SysID ensemble to make informed decisions that balance task performance (exploitation) with the need to collect informative data for improving the dynamics model (exploration).
*   **Mechanism:** We will integrate uncertainty into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework or directly into the policy's action selection.
    *   **Uncertainty-Aware MPC (if applicable):** Use the probabilistic dynamics ensemble $\hat{f}^{(i)} = f_{sim} + \Delta \hat{f}_{\theta_{dyn}^{(i)}}$ for trajectory optimization. The objective function within MPC can be modified to optimize for expected return under uncertainty, potentially favoring actions leading to states where the model is confident or actions that reduce uncertainty (inspired by Kim et al., 2023). For instance, maximizing:
        $$ \max_{a_t...a_{t+H}} \mathbb{E}_{i} \left[ \sum_{k=t}^{t+H} \gamma^{k-t} r(s_k^{(i)}, a_k) \right] - \lambda \sum_{k=t}^{t+H} \gamma^{k-t} U(s_k^{(i)}, a_k) $$
        where $s_k^{(i)}$ are rollouts under model $i$, and $\lambda$ balances reward and uncertainty penalty/bonus.
    *   **Exploration Bonus:** Alternatively, add an exploration bonus proportional to $U(s, a)$ to the rewards used for policy adaptation or directly modify the action selection probabilities to favor exploring uncertain state-action regions (inspired by Davis & Brown, 2024). For example, in an actor-critic setting, the value target could be augmented: $V_{target}(s) = r + \gamma (\mathbb{E}[V(s')] + \eta \mathbb{E}[U(s', a')])$.
    *   **Adaptive Learning Rate:** The uncertainty can also modulate the learning rate of the SysID module itself, learning faster when uncertainty is high and new data is informative.

### 2.3 Data Collection

*   **Simulation Environment:** We will use a realistic physics simulator like MuJoCo (Todorov et al., 2012) or Isaac Gym (Makoviychuk et al., 2021) for its speed and ability to simulate complex contact dynamics. We will define benchmark manipulation tasks (e.g., pushing objects with varying friction/mass, peg insertion with varying tolerances, non-prehensile manipulation like flipping a box). During meta-training, dynamics parameters (friction coefficients, object masses, damping, actuator delays) will be sampled from distributions to create diverse training tasks.
*   **Real-World Environment:** Experiments will be conducted on a standard robotic platform, such as a Franka Emika Panda or a UR5e arm, equipped with appropriate sensors (e.g., proprioceptive sensors, wrist-mounted force/torque sensor, external RGB-D cameras for state estimation). Real-world data $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})_{real}$ will be collected continuously during the online adaptation phase. State $s_t$ will include joint positions/velocities, end-effector pose, and relevant object poses estimated via vision or other sensors.

### 2.4 Experimental Design

*   **Research Questions:**
    1.  Does the integrated framework outperform baseline sim-to-real methods in terms of final task performance and adaptation speed when faced with significant reality gaps or changes in dynamics?
    2.  How does each component (Online SysID, Meta-Learning, Uncertainty-Awareness) contribute to the overall performance and robustness?
    3.  How does the framework scale with task complexity and the magnitude of the dynamics mismatch?
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  *Object Pushing:* Push an object to a target location on surfaces with unknown or changing friction coefficients.
    2.  *Peg Insertion:* Insert a peg into a hole where the exact position/orientation of the hole or the robot's kinematic calibration might have small errors that evolve.
    3.  *Dynamic Object Manipulation:* Manipulate an object whose mass or mass distribution changes unexpectedly (e.g., picking up a container that gets filled).
*   **Baselines for Comparison:**
    1.  *Zero-Shot Transfer:* Policy trained in the nominal simulator and deployed directly.
    2.  *Domain Randomization (DR):* Policy trained with standard DR across simulation parameters.
    3.  *Offline SysID + Fine-tuning:* Identify system parameters offline using calibration data, tune the simulator, and fine-tune a policy trained in the tuned simulator using limited real data.
    4.  *Online SysID + Adaptive Control (No Meta-Learning):* Use the online SysID module but with a standard RL policy that adapts online from scratch or via fine-tuning (similar to an adaptive MPC approach, cf. Mei et al., 2025).
    5.  *Meta-RL (No Online SysID):* Use the meta-trained policy but without online SysID, relying only on the initial meta-training for robustness (similar to standard MAML for sim-to-real, cf. Martinez & White, 2023).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  *Task Success Rate:* Percentage of successful task completions.
    2.  *Asymptotic Performance:* Performance level (e.g., final distance error, completion time) after adaptation converges.
    3.  *Adaptation Speed:* Number of real-world samples or time required to reach a target performance threshold after introduction to the real environment or after a sudden dynamics change.
    4.  *Sample Efficiency:* Total number of real-world interactions required during deployment.
    5.  *Robustness:* Performance consistency across different trials and slight environmental variations. We will measure the variance in performance metrics.
*   **Ablation Studies:** We will perform ablation studies by disabling each of the three main components (Online SysID, Meta-Learning, Uncertainty-Awareness) to quantify their individual contributions to the overall performance.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### 3.1 Expected Outcomes
We expect the proposed self-adaptive framework to demonstrate significant improvements over existing sim-to-real transfer methods:

1.  **Superior Robustness and Adaptation:** The integrated framework is expected to achieve higher success rates and maintain better performance on tasks involving unmodeled or changing dynamics compared to zero-shot, standard DR, and offline SysID approaches. We anticipate faster adaptation to these changes than methods relying solely on online fine-tuning without meta-learned priors.
2.  **Quantifiable Benefits of Integration:** Experimental results, including ablation studies SOTAill quantify the synergistic benefits of combining online SysID (providing accurate, up-to-date dynamics), meta-learning (providing a policy primed for adaptation), and uncertainty-awareness (guiding efficient exploration and safe exploitation).
3.  **Demonstration on Complex Tasks:** Successful deployment on challenging manipulation tasks will validate the framework's applicability to real-world robotic problems requiring precise control and interaction with the environment.
4.  **Open-Source Contribution:** We plan to release an implementation of the framework and potentially standardized benchmark results based on our experiments to facilitate further research in the community.

### 3.2 Impact

1.  **Bridging the Reality Gap:** Our work offers a promising direction for overcoming a fundamental barrier in robot learning, potentially accelerating the deployment of learned robotic skills in real-world applications like manufacturing, logistics automation, healthcare assistance, and domestic service robotics.
2.  **Enabling Lifelong Robot Learning:** The continuous adaptation capability moves towards robots that can learn and improve throughout their operational lifetime, handling wear and tear, environmental changes, and novel situations without requiring constant human supervision or re-engineering.
3.  **Advancing Foundational AI:** The integration of online learning, meta-learning, and uncertainty quantification in a complex, embodied setting provides a rich testbed for these AI techniques, potentially generating new insights and algorithms applicable to other domains where models must adapt to changing data streams or environments.
4.  **Contribution to Human-Level Robot Abilities:** By focusing on robustness and adaptability – key characteristics of human physical competence – this research directly contributes to the overarching goal of the ICLR Robot Learning Workshop: understanding and building robots with more general and reliable physical capabilities.

In conclusion, this proposal outlines a comprehensive research plan to develop and validate a novel self-adaptive sim-to-real framework. By integrating online system identification, meta-learning, and uncertainty-aware control, we aim to create robots that can robustly and efficiently adapt their learned skills to the complexities and dynamics of the real world, marking a significant step towards achieving human-level physical abilities in artificial systems.
