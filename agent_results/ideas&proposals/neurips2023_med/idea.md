**Title:**  
Enhancing Robustness and Interpretability in Clinical Machine Learning: A Bayesian-Informed Self-Supervised Framework  

**Motivation:**  
Medical imaging datasets are often small, noisy, and subject to high inter-observer variability, hindering the deployment of reliable machine learning models. Existing solutions struggle to balance accuracy with robustness against adversarial perturbations and lack transparency, which is critical for clinical trust. There is a pressing need to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applicability in medical imaging, particularly under economic and data scarcity constraints.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a novel hybrid framework combining self-supervised pre-training and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) to improve robustness and interpretability. Self-supervised learning (e.g., contrastive learning with anatomical invariant augmentations) will enable efficient feature extraction from sparse labeled datasets. BNNs will quantify predictive uncertainty, enhancing robustness to distributional shifts and adversarial attacks. Additionally, integrating attention-based explainability modules, calibrated to align with Bayesian uncertainty estimates, will generate clinician-friendly visual interpretations. Validation will include multitask objectives (e.g., tumor segmentation + diagnosis reliability scoring) on heterogeneous modalities (MRI, X-ray) with simulated/real-world noise. Expected outcomes include improved adversarial robustness (+15% AUC over baselines), uncertainty calibration metrics, and interpretable error margins for clinicians. This work aims to advance ML deployment in healthcare by addressing critical gaps in reliability, interpretability, and data efficiency.
