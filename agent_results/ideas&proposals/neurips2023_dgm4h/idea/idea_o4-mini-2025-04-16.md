Title: PediFlow: Privacy-Preserving Interpretable Multimodal Generative Flows for Pediatric ICU Data

Motivation: Pediatric intensive care units (ICUs) face acute data scarcity and stringent privacy constraints, limiting the development of robust decision-support tools. Synthetic data that faithfully captures cross‐modal correlations (vitals, labs, imaging) while guaranteeing patient privacy and offering interpretability would accelerate model training, benchmark reproducibility, and clinical trust.

Main Idea: PediFlow couples normalizing flows and latent diffusion to learn a shared representation of time‐series vitals, laboratory tests, and imaging embeddings. During training, each modality is mapped to an orthogonal latent subspace, enforcing disentanglement and semantic alignment (e.g., organ systems, treatment phases). A conditional diffusion process on this compact latent manifold generates realistic multimodal samples. Differential‐privacy guarantees are introduced in the flow updates to protect individual records. Interpretability arises from latent traversals—clinicians can vary specific factors (e.g., heart rate dynamics) and observe cohort‐level effects. We will validate PediFlow with distributional metrics, downstream risk‐prediction benchmarks, and clinician blind‐reviews, demonstrating its potential to enrich pediatric ICU modeling while preserving privacy and transparency.
