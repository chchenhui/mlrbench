Title  
Multimodal Hierarchical Diffusion Models for Robust and Explainable Healthcare Diagnostics  

1. Introduction  
Background  
The explosion of electronic health records (EHR), medical imaging (CT, MRI, X-ray), and unstructured clinical narratives has created an unprecedented opportunity to improve diagnostic accuracy via AI. However, existing AI diagnostic systems often process each modality in isolation, missing critical cross-modal patterns. Moreover, rare diseases and underrepresented patient cohorts suffer from data scarcity, leading to biased or unreliable predictions. Real-world clinical deployment is further hindered by noisy or missing modalities (e.g., unavailable imaging, incomplete notes) and the black-box nature of many deep models, which undermines clinical trust.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a unified generative-classification framework, called MH-Diff, that:  
1. Jointly models heterogeneous modalities (imaging, structured EHR, free-text notes) via a hierarchical diffusion process in a shared latent space.  
2. Learns robust cross-modal representations that remain predictive even when some modalities are missing or corrupted.  
3. Integrates medical priors through specialized attention modules anchored on clinical ontologies.  
4. Produces interpretable diagnostic explanations via cross-modal feature attribution.  
5. Demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and robustness on rare diseases and underrepresented cohorts.  

Significance  
By marrying recent advances in diffusion models with multimodal fusion and domain-informed attention, MH-Diff addresses fundamental challenges in medical AI: data scarcity, missing modalities, and explainability. The resulting system will facilitate equitable, trustworthy diagnostics across diverse patient groups and clinical settings.  

2. Methodology  

2.1 Overview of Approach  
MH-Diff comprises three main components (Figure 1):  
A. Modality-specific encoding: Each input modality $m\in\{1,\dots,M\}$ is mapped to an embedding $z_m\in\mathbb{R}^d$ via an encoder $E_m$.  
B. Shared diffusion process: A forward noise‐adding and reverse denoising process defined on the fused latent representation $z=\mathrm{Fuse}(z_1,\dots,z_M)$, yielding a generative latent prior $p_\theta(z)$.  
C. Downstream diagnostic head: A classifier $C_\phi$ that predicts diagnosis labels $\hat{y}$ from $z_0$ (the denoised latent) and produces modality-wise attribution maps.  

2.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
Datasets  
– MIMIC-CXR: Chest X-rays + associated notes.  
– UK Biobank: MRI brain scans + structured labs + ICD codes + clinical narratives.  
– Institutional ICU registry: multimodal pediatric ICU data (imaging, labs, nursing notes).  
Targets  
– Alzheimer’s disease vs. mild cognitive impairment vs. healthy (UKB).  
– Pneumonia detection on chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR).  
– Rare disease cohort (e.g., HIV severity stages) drawn from institutional registry.  
Preprocessing  
– Imaging: resizing to $224\times224$, intensity normalization.  
– Text: de-identification, tokenization with clinical BERT vocabulary.  
– Structured EHR: categorical embedding for ICD/SNOMED codes; z-score normalization for lab values.  
– Ontology Graph: SNOMED-CT relations preprocessed into adjacency $A_{\mathrm{onto}}$.  

2.3 Model Architecture  

2.3.1 Modality Encoders  
For each modality $m$:  
– Imaging ($m=1$): CNN encoder $E_1(x)\!=\!\mathrm{ResNet50}_{\mathrm{pre}}(x)\!\in\!\mathbb{R}^d$.  
– Text ($m=2$): ClinicalBERT encoder $E_2(t)\!=\!\mathrm{BERT}_{\mathrm{clin}}(t)\! \in\!\mathbb{R}^d$.  
– Structured ($m=3$): MLP encoder $E_3(s)\!=\!\mathrm{ReLU}(W_s s + b_s)\!\in\!\mathbb{R}^d$.  

2.3.2 Fusion and Domain-Knowledge Attention  
We fuse embeddings via cross-modal attention guided by ontology:  
For each modality pair $(i,j)$, compute attention scores:  
$$  
\alpha_{ij} = \mathrm{softmax}_j\bigl((z_i W_Q)(z_j W_K)^\top + \lambda A_{\mathrm{onto},ij}\bigr),  
$$  
where $W_Q,W_K\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ and $A_{\mathrm{onto},ij}=1$ if concepts of modalities $i,j$ are linked in SNOMED-CT. The fused embedding is  
$$  
z = \sum_{i=1}^M \sum_{j=1}^M \alpha_{ij} (z_j W_V),  
$$  
with $W_V\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$.  

2.3.3 Hierarchical Diffusion Process  
We adopt a continuous‐time diffusion model on $z\in\mathbb{R}^d$ following Song et al. Forward SDE:  
$$  
dz = f(t) z\,dt + g(t)\,d\omega_t,\quad z(0)=z,  
$$  
where $f(t),g(t)$ control the noise schedule and $\omega_t$ is Wiener noise. The reverse SDE is parameterized by score network $s_\theta(z,t)$:  
$$  
dz = \bigl[f(t)z - g^2(t)\nabla_z \log p_\theta(z,t)\bigr]\,dt + g(t)\,d\bar\omega_t.  
$$  
We train $s_\theta$ to match $\nabla_z \log p(z,t)$ via denoising score matching:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{diff}} = \mathbb{E}_{t, z_0,\epsilon}\bigl[\|s_\theta(z_t,t) - \tfrac{\epsilon}{g(t)}\|_2^2\bigr],\quad z_t = z_0\alpha(t) + \epsilon\beta(t),  
$$  
with known scalars $\alpha(t),\beta(t)$.  

2.3.4 Adaptive Modality Masking  
To enforce robustness to missing modalities, during training we randomly drop each modality embedding $z_m$ with probability $p_{\mathrm{mask}}$. Dropped embeddings are replaced by learnable tokens $e_m^{\ast}$. This yields variant fused embeddings $z^{\prime}$ on which the diffusion process and classifier also operate.  

2.3.5 Diagnostic Classifier and Explainability  
The final denoised latent $\hat z_0$ is fed into a classification head  
$$  
\hat y = \mathrm{softmax}(W_c\hat z_0 + b_c),  
$$  
trained with cross-entropy loss $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CE}}(y,\hat y)$. We obtain modality-wise attributions via integrated gradients:  
$$  
\mathrm{IG}_m = (\hat z_0 - z_{\mathrm{baseline}}) \odot \int_{\alpha=0}^1 \frac{\partial C_\phi(z_{\mathrm{baseline}}+\alpha(\hat z_0 - z_{\mathrm{baseline}}))}{\partial z_m}\,d\alpha.  
$$  

2.4 Training Objectives  
The overall loss is  
$$  
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CE}} + \lambda_{\mathrm{diff}}\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{diff}} + \lambda_{\mathrm{adv}}\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{adv}} + \lambda_{\mathrm{IG}}\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{IG\mbox{-}reg}},  
$$  
where  
– $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{adv}}$ encourages synthetic consistency across modalities (GAN-style penalty).  
– $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{IG\mbox{-}reg}}$ penalizes noisy attributions.  
Hyperparameters $\lambda_\ast$ tuned via grid search on validation set.  

2.5 Experimental Design  
Baselines  
– Unimodal CNN, BERT, MLP classifiers.  
– Early fusion (concatenation + MLP).  
– MedM2G (Zhan et al. ’24), DiffMIC (Yang et al. ’23).  

Evaluation Protocol  
– 5-fold cross-validation on each dataset.  
– External validation on held-out hospital site.  
Metrics  
1. Classification: accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1, sensitivity/specificity.  
2. Calibration: expected calibration error (ECE).  
3. Robustness: performance drop when 1–2 modalities masked at test time.  
4. Generative quality: Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) on synthetic embeddings.  
5. Explainability: human expert rating of attribution maps (Likert scale).  

Ablation Studies  
– Without adaptive masking.  
– Without ontology-guided attention.  
– Without diffusion generative prior (replace with VAE).  

Implementation Details  
– Optimizer: AdamW, lr=1e-4, batch size=32, trained for 100 epochs.  
– Noise schedule: linear $\beta_t\in[1e\!-\!4,0.02]$.  
– Codebase: PyTorch Lightning on 8×A100 GPUs.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

Expected Outcomes  
1. A unified, open-source implementation of MH-Diff.  
2. Demonstrated improvement over state-of-the-art baselines by +3–5% in ROC-AUC on rare disease classification and +2% on common diagnoses.  
3. Robust performance degradation <2% when up to two modalities are missing, compared to >10% drop in baselines.  
4. High-quality cross-modal attribution maps that align with clinician annotations (average expert rating ≥4/5).  
5. Peer-reviewed publications in top ML and medical informatics venues.  

Clinical & Societal Impact  
– Equitable diagnostics: By improving performance on underrepresented groups (pediatrics, rare diseases), MH-Diff reduces health disparities.  
– Trust & transparency: Feature-level explanations facilitate clinician trust and expedite regulatory approval.  
– Data privacy: The generative prior enables synthetic data augmentation, alleviating privacy concerns and boosting downstream model training on sensitive cohorts.  
– Deployment readiness: Robustness to missing modalities mirrors real clinical workflows, easing integration into hospital IT systems.  

Long-Term Vision  
This project paves the way for broad adoption of multimodal generative AI in healthcare. Future extensions include active-learning loops with clinician feedback, continuous model updating with federated learning, and real-time integration into clinical decision support systems.
