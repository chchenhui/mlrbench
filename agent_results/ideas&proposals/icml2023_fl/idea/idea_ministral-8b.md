### Title: **Scalable Federated Learning for Real-time Personalization**

### Motivation:
The rapid growth of mobile and IoT devices has led to an explosion of data, but sharing this data for training models is often infeasible due to privacy concerns and data silos. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling model training across decentralized devices without exchanging raw data. However, current FL systems struggle with scalability, real-time personalization, and the integration of diverse data sources. This research aims to address these challenges to make FL practical for real-world applications.

### Main Idea:
This research proposes a novel approach to scalable federated learning for real-time personalization. The methodology involves:
1. **Distributed Model Aggregation**: Implementing a lightweight, distributed model aggregation algorithm that minimizes communication overhead and latency.
2. **Adaptive Learning Rates**: Developing an adaptive learning rate scheme that dynamically adjusts based on device capabilities and network conditions.
3. **Real-time Data Fusion**: Incorporating a real-time data fusion mechanism that integrates diverse data sources, ensuring model accuracy and relevance.
4. **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employing an automated hyperparameter tuning framework that optimizes model performance across various devices and settings.

Expected outcomes include:
- A scalable FL system capable of handling thousands of devices with minimal latency.
- Real-time personalization models that adapt to user preferences and behaviors.
- Improved model accuracy and robustness through effective data fusion.
- Enhanced privacy and security through differential privacy techniques.

Potential impact:
This research will bridge the gap between theoretical FL and practical applications, enabling real-time personalization in various domains such as healthcare, finance, and retail. It will also contribute to the broader adoption of FL by providing a scalable and efficient solution that respects user privacy and data sovereignty.
