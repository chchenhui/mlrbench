**Title:** Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models via Parameter-Efficient Adapters  

**Motivation:** Foundation models (e.g., LLMs) are resource-intensive, making their deployment in federated learning (FL) settings challenging due to client computation and communication constraints. Current FL approaches, which transmit full model updates, are impractical for these large models. This research addresses the critical need to enable scalable, privacy-preserving adaptation of foundation models across decentralized devices without compromising performance.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a framework combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or adapter modules, with FL. Clients locally train small, lightweight adapter modules attached to frozen foundation model layers, reducing compute and communication costs by transmitting only adapter weights. The server aggregates adapters via dynamic strategies (e.g., weighted averaging based on client data distribution) to handle heterogeneity. Experiments will evaluate communication efficiency, model accuracy, and robustness across tasks (e.g., personalized text generation). Expected outcomes include a 10-100x reduction in communication overhead compared to vanilla FL, while maintaining competitive performance. This approach enables practical FL deployment for foundation models, benefitting applications like on-device AI assistants and healthcare analytics.
