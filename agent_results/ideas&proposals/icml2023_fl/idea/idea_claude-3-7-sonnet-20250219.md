# Title: Adaptive Federated Learning for Distribution Shift Resilience

## Motivation
Distribution shifts between client data in federated learning settings significantly impact model performance, causing degradation when deployed across diverse real-world environments. Current approaches typically handle this challenge using static strategies, ignoring the temporal and contextual nature of distribution shifts in production environments. This research addresses the critical need for federated learning systems that dynamically adapt to evolving data distributions across clients without compromising privacy or requiring excessive communication overhead.

## Main Idea
We propose an adaptive federated learning framework that continuously monitors and responds to distribution shifts across clients. The system employs a three-phase approach: (1) A lightweight distribution shift detection mechanism using statistical divergence measures computed locally on client devices; (2) An adaptive aggregation strategy that dynamically adjusts client contribution weights based on detected distribution patterns and relevance to target distribution; and (3) A personalization layer that fine-tunes the global model on each client using meta-learning techniques. The framework incorporates a feedback loop where model performance metrics inform the adaptation strategy, allowing the system to learn which adaptation techniques work best for specific types of distribution shifts. This approach promises to improve model robustness and performance in real-world federated settings where distribution shifts are inevitable, while maintaining the privacy guarantees inherent to federated learning.
