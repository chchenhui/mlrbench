**Research Proposal: FedPEFT: Parameter-Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning for Foundation Models on Heterogeneous Devices**  

---

### 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Foundation Models (FMs), such as large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers, have revolutionized machine learning by achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. However, deploying these models in federated learning (FL) settings—where data remains decentralized on edge devices—poses significant challenges. Traditional FL approaches require clients to transmit full model updates, which is infeasible for FMs due to their massive size (e.g., billions of parameters). This creates a tension between privacy preservation (a core FL principle) and practical feasibility, as full fine-tuning on resource-constrained devices incurs prohibitive communication and computation costs.  

Recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and adapter modules, have shown promise in reducing trainable parameters during fine-tuning. However, integrating PEFT into FL remains underexplored, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous client devices (varying compute, memory, and data distributions). Existing works like SLoRA and FeDeRA address partial aspects of this problem but lack adaptive mechanisms to handle device heterogeneity or dynamic aggregation strategies for sparse PEFT updates.  

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal aims to develop **FedPEFT**, a framework for federated fine-tuning of FMs that combines PEFT techniques with adaptive resource-aware optimization. The key objectives are:  
1. Design a federated PEFT framework that enables clients to fine-tune only small, task-specific modules (e.g., LoRA matrices) instead of full FMs.  
2. Develop **adaptive PEFT module allocation** strategies to tailor module complexity (e.g., rank of LoRA matrices) to client device capabilities and data characteristics.  
3. Propose novel aggregation mechanisms for sparse, heterogeneous PEFT updates to ensure global model convergence.  
4. Validate FedPEFT’s efficiency, scalability, and performance across diverse FL scenarios, including cross-device and cross-silo settings.  

**Significance**  
FedPEFT bridges the gap between theoretical PEFT advancements and practical FL deployment by addressing critical challenges in communication overhead, device heterogeneity, and privacy. By enabling efficient fine-tuning of FMs on edge devices, it empowers applications in healthcare, smart devices, and personalized AI while adhering to data sovereignty requirements.

### 2. Methodology  

#### 2.1 Data Collection and Task Setup  
- **Datasets**: Evaluate FedPEFT on vision (CIFAR-10, FEMNIST) and NLP (GLUE, personalized text generation) tasks. Use both IID and non-IID splits (via Dirichlet distribution with concentration parameter $\alpha \in \{0.1, 1.0\}$) to simulate data heterogeneity.  
- **Foundation Models**: Test with ViT-Base for vision and DistilBERT for NLP tasks.  
- **Device Heterogeneity Simulation**: Profile client devices into three tiers based on computational resources (e.g., low-tier: mobile phones, high-tier: edge servers).  

#### 2.2 FedPEFT Algorithm Design  
**Local PEFT Training**  
Each client $i$ fine-tunes a PEFT module $\Delta W_i$ on its local data. For LoRA, the weight update is parameterized as:  
$$
\Delta W_i = A_i B_i^T \quad \text{where} \quad A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r_i}, \ B_i \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times r_i},
$$  
and $r_i$ is the low-rank dimension adapted to the client’s compute capability. Only $A_i$ and $B_i$ are trained and transmitted to the server.  

**Adaptive PEFT Module Allocation**  
The rank $r_i$ for client $i$ is dynamically determined using a lightweight profiler that assesses device memory ($M_i$), compute ($C_i$), and data size ($D_i$):  
$$
r_i = \left\lfloor r_{\text{max}} \cdot \frac{\lambda_1 M_i + \lambda_2 C_i + \lambda_3 D_i}{\lambda_1 M_{\text{max}} + \lambda_2 C_{\text{max}} + \lambda_3 D_{\text{max}}} \right\rfloor,
$$  
where $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ are tunable coefficients, and $r_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum rank allowed.  

**Federated Aggregation Strategy**  
The server aggregates sparse LoRA updates using a **SVD-weighted averaging** scheme:  
1. For each client’s $\Delta W_i$, compute its singular values $\Sigma_i = \text{diag}(\sigma_{i1}, \dots, \sigma_{ir_i})$.  
2. Assign aggregation weights $w_i$ proportional to the Frobenius norm of $\Sigma_i$ and the client’s data size $n_i$:  
$$
w_i = \frac{n_i \cdot \|\Sigma_i\|_F}{\sum_{j=1}^N n_j \cdot \|\Sigma_j\|_F}.
$$  
3. Reconstruct the global LoRA matrices $A_g, B_g$ via weighted SVD aggregation (see Figure 1).  

#### 2.3 Experimental Design  
- **Baselines**: Compare against FedAvg (full fine-tuning), SLoRA, FeDeRA, and FedP$^2$EFT.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Communication Cost**: Total bytes transmitted per training round.  
  - **Model Utility**: Test accuracy/F1-score on centralized validation sets.  
  - **Resource Efficiency**: Training time per round and energy consumption (simulated via FLSim).  
  - **Personalization**: Client-specific task performance using local test data.  
- **Implementation**: Use PyTorch and Flower framework; simulate 100+ clients with 10% participation per round.

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Reduced Communication Overhead**: FedPEFT is expected to reduce communication costs by 80–95% compared to full model fine-tuning (e.g., 10 MB/round vs. 1 GB/round for a 100M-parameter FM).  
2. **Improved Heterogeneity Handling**: Adaptive rank allocation will enable clients with low-tier devices to achieve 70–90% of the accuracy of high-tier devices.  
3. **Superior Convergence**: SVD-weighted aggregation will outperform naive averaging in non-IID settings, closing the accuracy gap with centralized fine-tuning by 15–20%.  

**Broader Impact**  
- **Privacy-Preserving AI**: By minimizing data exposure and enabling on-device FM fine-tuning, FedPEFT aligns with GDPR and HIPAA compliance requirements.  
- **Democratization of FMs**: Resource-constrained organizations and edge devices can leverage state-of-the-art FMs without costly infrastructure.  
- **Research Community**: The open-sourced FedPEFT framework will provide a benchmark for future work on efficient federated fine-tuning.
