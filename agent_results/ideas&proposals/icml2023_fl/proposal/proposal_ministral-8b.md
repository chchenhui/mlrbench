# FedPEFT: Parameter-Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning for Foundation Models on Heterogeneous Devices

## Introduction

Foundation Models (FMs) have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence by enabling state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks with a single model. However, deploying these models in federated learning (FL) environments presents unique challenges. The massive size of FMs prohibits their full fine-tuning on resource-constrained client devices due to prohibitive communication and computation costs. Centralized fine-tuning, conversely, compromises user data privacy, undermining a core principle of FL.

This research proposal aims to bridge this gap by introducing FedPEFT, a framework that adapts Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques for the federated setting. Instead of transmitting entire models or gradients, clients train and communicate only small, task-specific PEFT modules. This drastically reduces communication overhead. The research will explore adaptive PEFT module allocation based on client device capabilities (computation, memory) and data characteristics, alongside novel aggregation strategies tailored for sparse, low-rank PEFT updates. Expected outcomes include enabling efficient, privacy-preserving personalization of large FMs on diverse edge devices and demonstrating improved model utility with significantly reduced communication costs compared to traditional federated fine-tuning approaches.

The proposed research follows a systematic approach, combining theoretical analysis, algorithmic development, and experimental validation. The methodology can be broken down into the following key steps:

1. **Literature Review and State-of-the-Art Analysis**: Conduct an in-depth review of existing PEFT techniques and federated learning methods to identify gaps and opportunities for improvement.
2. **Framework Design**: Develop the FedPEFT framework, incorporating adaptive PEFT module allocation and novel aggregation strategies.
3. **Algorithm Development**: Implement the FedPEFT framework using a suitable programming language and libraries.
4. **Experimental Setup**: Design and conduct experiments to evaluate the performance, efficiency, and privacy of the FedPEFT framework.
5. **Results Analysis and Discussion**: Analyze the experimental results and discuss the implications of the findings.
6. **Iterative Refinement**: Refine the framework based on the experimental results and feedback from stakeholders.

### Data Collection

The data for this research will include:
- **Foundation Models**: Pre-trained large language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, T5) will be used as the starting point for fine-tuning.
- **Client Data**: Synthetic data will be generated to simulate diverse client data distributions, ensuring the robustness of the FedPEFT framework.
- **Device Capabilities**: Information on client device capabilities (computation, memory) will be collected to inform adaptive PEFT module allocation.

### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - Load the pre-trained foundation model.
   - Initialize PEFT modules (e.g., LoRA, Adapters) for each client.

2. **Client Training**:
   - For each client, train the PEFT modules on local data.
   - Update the PEFT modules using an appropriate optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam, SGD).

3. **Adaptive PEFT Module Allocation**:
   - Evaluate client device capabilities and data characteristics.
   - Allocate PEFT modules based on the evaluation results, ensuring efficient use of resources.

4. **Aggregation**:
   - Clients send their PEFT updates to the server.
   - The server aggregates the updates using a novel aggregation strategy tailored for sparse, low-rank PEFT updates.

5. **Model Update**:
   - The server updates the global model using the aggregated PEFT updates.
   - The updated model is sent back to the clients for the next round of training.

### Mathematical Formulations

The PEFT module update can be represented as follows:

\[ \mathbf{W}_i^{(t+1)} = \mathbf{W}_i^{(t)} + \alpha \mathbf{g}_i^{(t)} \]

where:
- \( \mathbf{W}_i \) is the PEFT module for client \( i \).
- \( \mathbf{g}_i \) is the gradient update for client \( i \).
- \( \alpha \) is the learning rate.

The aggregation strategy can be formulated as:

\[ \mathbf{W}^{(t+1)} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{W}_i^{(t+1)} / N \]

where:
- \( \mathbf{W}^{(t+1)} \) is the aggregated PEFT module.
- \( N \) is the number of clients.

### Experimental Design

The experimental design will include the following steps:

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare the performance of FedPEFT with traditional federated fine-tuning methods.
2. **Resource Constraints**: Evaluate the performance of FedPEFT under different resource constraints (computation, memory).
3. **Data Heterogeneity**: Assess the robustness of FedPEFT to data heterogeneity.
4. **Privacy and Security Analysis**: Conduct privacy and security analyses to ensure the preservation of data privacy during model training and updates.

### Evaluation Metrics
