**1. Title:** **FedPEFT: Adaptive Parameter-Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning for Foundation Models on Heterogeneous Devices**

---

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Foundation Models (FMs), characterized by their massive scale and pre-training on vast datasets, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, including natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Fine-tuning these FMs on downstream tasks often yields state-of-the-art performance. However, deploying and fine-tuning these behemoth models in real-world scenarios presents significant challenges, particularly in settings where data is distributed and privacy is paramount.

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training machine learning models collaboratively on decentralized data residing on user devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices) or across organizational silos (e.g., hospitals, banks) without centralizing the raw data (McMahan et al., 2017; Kairouz et al., 2021). This paradigm inherently enhances data privacy and security. However, the standard FL approach, often involving the communication of full model updates or gradients, becomes computationally and communicatively intractable when applied directly to large FMs due to their sheer size (often billions of parameters). Training a full FM locally on resource-constrained edge devices is often infeasible due to limited memory and processing power. Conversely, fine-tuning FMs centrally requires aggregating user data, which violates the core privacy principles of FL and raises significant regulatory and ethical concerns.

To bridge this gap, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques have gained traction (Houlsby et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021). PEFT methods aim to adapt large pre-trained models to downstream tasks by fine-tuning only a small fraction of the model's parameters or by introducing a small set of new, trainable parameters (e.g., Adapters, LoRA, Prefix-Tuning). This drastically reduces the computational and memory overhead of fine-tuning and the number of parameters that need to be stored and communicated.

Integrating PEFT methods into the federated learning framework offers a promising direction for enabling the collaborative fine-tuning of FMs on distributed, private data. Recent works, as highlighted in our literature review (Sun et al., 2022; Babakniya et al., 2023; Yan et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2024; Chua et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2024), have begun exploring this intersection, demonstrating the potential for significant communication savings while maintaining competitive model performance (termed FedPEFT by Sun et al., 2022, SLoRA, FeDeRA, FedP$^2$EFT, FedMCP, FedPEAT, FedPT, FedCoLLM).

**2.2 Problem Statement and Motivation**
Despite initial progress, effectively deploying PEFT within FL, especially in realistic cross-device settings, remains challenging. Key challenges include:

1.  **System Heterogeneity:** Client devices in FL networks exhibit significant variability in computational power, memory capacity, network bandwidth, and battery life. A fixed PEFT strategy (e.g., fixed LoRA rank) may be too demanding for low-end devices or suboptimal for high-end devices, hindering participation and overall efficiency.
2.  **Data Heterogeneity:** Data distributions across clients are typically non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). This statistical heterogeneity can degrade the performance of aggregated global models and requires careful consideration in both local training and server aggregation strategies.
3.  **Adaptive Strategy:** Existing federated PEFT approaches often employ a uniform PEFT configuration across all clients or focus primarily on data heterogeneity (e.g., SLoRA, FeDeRA) or personalized structures (FedP$^2$EFT). There is a need for a more holistic framework that dynamically adapts the PEFT strategy based on *both* the client's device capabilities (system heterogeneity) *and* local data characteristics (statistical heterogeneity).
4.  **Aggregation of Heterogeneous Updates:** If clients use different PEFT module structures or complexities (e.g., varying LoRA ranks) based on their capabilities, devising effective server-side aggregation strategies that properly combine these heterogeneous updates is non-trivial and underexplored. Standard averaging might be inapplicable or lead to suboptimal convergence and performance.

This research proposes **FedPEFT**, a novel framework for **Adaptive Parameter-Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning** of Foundation Models specifically designed to address the challenges of system and data heterogeneity in practical FL settings. While sharing the name with the initial work by Sun et al. (2022), our proposed FedPEFT framework introduces crucial novelties: dynamic, client-specific adaptation of PEFT configurations based on real-time device constraints and data properties, coupled with tailored aggregation mechanisms designed to handle the resulting heterogeneity in PEFT updates effectively.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
The primary goal of this research is to develop and evaluate the FedPEFT framework. Specific objectives include:

1.  **Develop an Adaptive PEFT Allocation Mechanism:** Design and implement algorithms that allow clients (or the server) to select appropriate PEFT methods (e.g., LoRA, Adapters) and their configurations (e.g., rank, layers to adapt, scaling factor) based on dynamically assessed client device capabilities (computation, memory, network) and local data characteristics (e.g., size, simple statistics).
2.  **Design Novel Aggregation Strategies for Heterogeneous PEFT Updates:** Develop and analyze aggregation algorithms at the server capable of meaningfully combining PEFT updates from clients that may employ different module structures or complexities (e.g., varying LoRA ranks).
3.  **Implement the FedPEFT Framework:** Build a simulation framework integrating the adaptive allocation and novel aggregation strategies with standard FL protocols for training FMs.
4.  **Empirically Evaluate FedPEFT:** Conduct extensive experiments on relevant benchmark datasets and FM architectures to evaluate FedPEFT in terms of:
    *   Model Utility (accuracy, perplexity, task-specific metrics) for both the global model and personalized models.
    *   System Efficiency (communication cost, estimated computation time, client memory footprint).
    *   Robustness to varying levels of data and system heterogeneity.
    *   Convergence speed compared to baseline methods.
5.  **Analyze Trade-offs and Provide Guidelines:** Investigate the interplay between PEFT adaptation complexity, aggregation strategies, model performance, and system efficiency. Provide practical guidelines for deploying FedPEFT.

**2.4 Significance**
This research holds significant potential for both the academic community and practical applications:

*   **Enabling Practical Federated FM Fine-tuning:** FedPEFT aims to make the fine-tuning of large FMs feasible and efficient in real-world FL settings, particularly on resource-constrained edge devices.
*   **Addressing Heterogeneity:** By explicitly tackling system and data heterogeneity through adaptive PEFT allocation and tailored aggregation, this work addresses a critical bottleneck in current FL systems.
*   **Advancing FL and PEFT Research:** It contributes novel algorithms for adaptive learning in heterogeneous distributed environments and explores new aggregation techniques beyond standard averaging, pushing the boundaries of both FL and PEFT research.
*   **Real-World Impact:** Successful development could unlock numerous applications requiring on-device intelligence powered by large models while preserving user privacy, such as personalized mobile assistants, privacy-preserving healthcare analytics on distributed hospital data, and collaborative enterprise AI without data sharing. This directly aligns with the workshop's focus on bridging the gap between FL theory and practice.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Research Design**
This research will follow a constructive and empirical methodology. We will design the FedPEFT framework components (adaptive allocation, aggregation), implement them within a realistic FL simulation environment, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate their effectiveness against established baselines under various conditions of heterogeneity.

**3.2 Data Collection and Simulation**
We will leverage publicly available benchmark datasets commonly used in FL and FM research, ensuring variety in data modality, task type, and heterogeneity characteristics.

*   **Datasets:**
    *   **NLP:** LEAF benchmarks (Sent140, Shakespeare) for simulating realistic non-IID and unbalanced data distributions in cross-device settings. GLUE benchmark tasks (e.g., SST-2, MNLI) adapted for FL simulation to evaluate general language understanding.
    *   **Computer Vision:** Federated CIFAR-10/100, potentially using Dirichlet distributions ($\mathrm{Dir}(\alpha)$) to control non-IID levels. Federated Extended MNIST (FEMNIST) for character recognition. Subsets of larger vision datasets like ImageNet or domain-specific datasets (e.g., medical imaging snippets, if ethically permissible and available under suitable licenses) could be considered for specific case studies, partitioned to simulate cross-silo FL.
*   **Foundation Models:** We will select representative FMs for evaluation, considering a balance between capability and simulation feasibility. Potential candidates include:
    *   **NLP:** Moderately sized variants of popular LLMs (e.g., OPT-1.3B, Llama-2-7B variants, BERT-large).
    *   **Vision:** Vision Transformer models (e.g., ViT-Base/Large).
*   **Heterogeneity Simulation:**
    *   **Data Heterogeneity:** We will use standard techniques like pathological non-IID partitioning (e.g., clients holding data from only a few classes) and concentration-based non-IID partitioning (using Dirichlet distribution over class labels) controlled by a parameter $\alpha$. We will also simulate varying quantities of data per client.
    *   **System Heterogeneity:** We will simulate diverse client capabilities by assigning different profiles to clients within the simulation. These profiles will dictate constraints such as:
        *   *Maximum allowable trainable parameters* (proxy for memory).
        *   *Local computation budget* (proxy for CPU/GPU speed, influencing local epochs $E$ or batch size).
        *   *Simulated network bandwidth* (influencing feasibility thresholds for communication).

**3.3 FedPEFT Framework Algorithm**
The FedPEFT framework operates within a standard FL paradigm (e.g., FedAvg structure) but modifies the client-side training and server-side aggregation steps.

*   **PEFT Method:** We will primarily focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2021) due to its effectiveness and well-defined structure. LoRA approximates the weight update $\Delta W$ for a pre-trained weight matrix $W_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$ as a low-rank product: $W = W_0 + \Delta W = W_0 + \mathbf{B}\mathbf{A}$, where $\mathbf{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$, $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$, and the rank $r \ll \min(d, k)$. Only $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are trained. We may also explore Adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019) as an alternative or complement.

*   **Overall Protocol (Round $t$):**
    1.  **Server Broadcast:** The server selects a subset of clients $S_t$ and sends the current global FM parameters $W_{global}$ (frozen) and the current global PEFT parameters $\Theta_t$ (e.g., LoRA matrices $\mathbf{A}_t, \mathbf{B}_t$ for relevant layers). It may also send initial guidance for PEFT adaptation.
    2.  **Client-Side Adaptation and Training (Client $k \in S_t$):**
        *   **a. Assess Resources & Data:** Client $k$ assesses its available resources (memory, compute estimate $C_k$, network $N_k$) and basic local data characteristics (dataset size $n_k$, possibly data complexity proxy $D_k$).
        *   **b. Adaptive PEFT Configuration:** Based on ($C_k, M_k, N_k, n_k, D_k$), Client $k$ determines its specific PEFT configuration $\mathcal{P}_k$. This could involve selecting the LoRA rank $r_k$, the scaling factor $\alpha_k$, and potentially which layers of the FM to apply LoRA to.
            *   *Mechanism:* We will explore two approaches:
                *   *Rule-Based:* Pre-defined rules mapping resource/data bins to PEFT configurations (e.g., if $M_k < M_{threshold}$, use $r_k=4$; else $r_k=8$).
                *   *Learning-Based (Advanced):* A lightweight meta-model (potentially learned centrally or via federated meta-learning) predicts an optimal $\mathcal{P}_k$.
        *   **c. Local Training:** Client $k$ initializes its chosen PEFT module $\theta_k$ (parameterized by $\mathcal{P}_k$) using the global $\Theta_t$ (potentially adapting it, e.g., projecting to a lower rank if $r_k < r_t$) or from scratch if structures are incompatible. It then performs local fine-tuning on its data $D_k$ for $E_k$ epochs (potentially adapted based on $C_k$), minimizing a local loss $L_{local}(\theta_k; D_k)$. The FM weights $W_{global}$ remain frozen. The output is the updated local PEFT module $\theta_{k, t+1}$.
        *   **d. Update Calculation:** Calculate the PEFT update $\Delta \theta_k = \theta_{k, t+1} - \theta_{k, t}$ (where $\theta_{k,t}$ is the state before local training).
    3.  **Client Upload:** Client $k$ uploads only its PEFT update $\Delta \theta_k$ (and potentially metadata $\mathcal{P}_k, n_k$) to the server. The size of $\Delta \theta_k$ is significantly smaller than full model updates.
    4.  **Server-Side Aggregation:**
        *   The server receives updates $\{\Delta \theta_k\}_{k \in S_t}$ which may correspond to different PEFT configurations (e.g., different LoRA ranks $r_k$).
        *   **Novel Aggregation Strategy:** We propose and compare strategies:
            *   *Strategy 1: Weighted Averaging with Padding/Truncation:* Assume LoRA updates $\Delta \theta_k = (\Delta \mathbf{A}_k, \Delta \mathbf{B}_k)$ with ranks $r_k$. Determine a target rank $r_{agg}$ (e.g., max rank, average rank, median rank). Pad matrices $\Delta \mathbf{A}_k, \Delta \mathbf{B}_k$ with zeros if $r_k < r_{agg}$, or truncate/project if $r_k > r_{agg}$. Then perform weighted averaging:
                $$ \Delta \Theta_{agg} = \sum_{k \in S_t} \frac{w_k}{\sum_{j \in S_t} w_j} \mathrm{Adjust}(\Delta \theta_k, r_{agg}) $$
                where $w_k$ could be $n_k$ (FedAvg style), $n_k \times f(r_k)$ (weighting by data size and complexity/rank), or based on client reliability/performance. $\mathrm{Adjust}(\cdot)$ performs the padding/truncation.
            *   *Strategy 2: Subspace Aggregation (Advanced):* Treat the columns of $\mathbf{B}_k$ and rows of $\mathbf{A}_k$ as basis vectors for the update subspace. Aggregate these subspaces, possibly using techniques inspired by subspace averaging or principal component analysis, to form the aggregated update $\Delta \Theta_{agg}$. This is more complex but potentially preserves more information from heterogeneous updates.
            *   *Strategy 3: Rank-Stratified Aggregation:* Group client updates by rank (or rank range), aggregate within each group, and then combine the aggregated group updates (e.g., weighted averaging based on group size).
        *   **Global PEFT Update:** The server updates the global PEFT parameters: $\Theta_{t+1} = \Theta_t + \eta \Delta \Theta_{agg}$ (where $\eta$ is a server learning rate).

**3.4 Experimental Design**
We will conduct a rigorous empirical evaluation:

*   **Baselines for Comparison:**
    *   **FedAvg-Full:** Standard FedAvg applied to fine-tune the entire FM (if feasible in simulation, serves as a high-cost performance reference).
    *   **FedAvg-PEFT (Fixed):** FL with a fixed PEFT configuration (e.g., LoRA with a fixed rank $r$) for all clients, similar to Sun et al. (2022) or SLoRA (Babakniya et al., 2023) without its specific initialization. We will test multiple fixed ranks (low, medium).
    *   **Centralized PEFT:** Fine-tuning the PEFT module on the (simulated) union of all client data. Performance upper bound (non-private).
    *   **Local PEFT:** Each client fine-tunes its PEFT module only on its local data without any communication/aggregation. Lower bound for collaboration benefit.
    *   **Other Federated PEFT Methods:** Where applicable and code is available, compare against methods like SLoRA, FeDeRA, or FedP$^2$EFT (potentially re-implementing key ideas if needed for fair comparison within our framework).
*   **Evaluation Scenarios:** We will vary:
    *   Degree of data heterogeneity ($\alpha$ in Dirichlet distribution).
    *   Degree of system heterogeneity (distribution of client compute/memory profiles).
    *   Number of clients and client participation rate per round.
    *   Choice of FM and PEFT method (primarily LoRA).
    *   Parameters of the FedPEFT framework (adaptation rules, aggregation strategy).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Model Utility:**
        *   *Global Model Performance:* Accuracy, F1-score, Perplexity (for LLMs), etc., evaluated on a held-out global test set.
        *   *Personalized Model Performance:* Evaluate the global model adapted with client-specific PEFT modules (or the final local PEFT modules) on each client's local test data. Report average and fairness metrics (e.g., standard deviation of performance across clients).
    *   **Efficiency:**
        *   *Communication Cost:* Total data uploaded/downloaded per client per round and aggregated over the entire training process (in MB or GB).
        *   *Computation Cost:* Wall-clock time for local training in simulation (acknowledging simulation limitations) or FLOPs count for local PEFT training.
        *   *Memory Footprint:* Peak memory required on the client device to load the model, PEFT modules, and perform training.
    *   **Convergence:** Plot accuracy/loss vs. communication rounds and vs. wall-clock time.
