# Title  
**Safe Adapter-Based Fine-Tuning for Vision–Language Robotics**

---

# Introduction  

## Background  
The proliferation of large-scale pre-trained vision–language models (VLMs) has revolutionized robotics by enabling rich semantic understanding for high-level planning and scene reasoning. Models like CLIP, Flamingo, and PaLM-E have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks requiring cross-modal alignment between visual inputs and linguistic instructions. However, deploying these models in real-world robotic systems faces critical challenges: (1) **costly fine-tuning** due to their massive parameter counts (e.g., PaLM-E contains over 500 billion parameters), (2) **safety risks** during exploration in dynamic environments, and (3) **data inefficiency** when adapting to novel tasks with limited hardware resources. This aligns with workshop concerns about safe deployment, generalization, and efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained models.  

## Research Objectives  
This study proposes **Safe Adapter-Based Fine-Tuning (SafeAdapt3D)**, a modular framework that decouples semantic reasoning from task-specific control while enforcing safety guarantees. The objectives are:  
1. **Develop lightweight safety adapters** that inject parameter-efficient adaptation into frozen VLM backbones (<5% of total parameters).  
2. **Integrate contrastive pre-training** with offline multimodal logs (RGB, depth, actions) to align adapter embeddings with robot state-action spaces.  
3. **Formalize safety-constrained reinforcement learning (RL)** to refine adapters on hardware, using a learned critic to veto risky actions.  
4. **Validate generalization** across unseen object categories and embodiments under stringent compute/data limits (e.g., ≤ 1000 real-world interactions).  

## Significance  
SafeAdapt3D addresses three pivotal gaps:  
- **Democratizing access**: By minimizing parameter updates, it reduces hardware requirements to a single GPU.  
- **Safe real-world deployment**: The safety critic ensures zero collisions during exploration, critical for high-consequence tasks (e.g., elderly care, industrial manipulation).  
- **Cross-modal generalization**: Contrastive pre-training bridges the sim-to-real gap for vision–language representations in open-world settings.

# Methodology  

## Overview of SafeAdapt3D  
SafeAdapt3D comprises three components (Fig. 1):  
1. **Frozen pre-trained VLM**: A large-scale model (e.g., CLIP or PaLM-E) that processes visual and language inputs but remains **static**.  
2. **SafetyAdapter**: Light-weight neural layers inserted at strategic depths in the VLM to encode task-specific control policies.  
3. **SafetyCritic**: A learnable module that constrains policy updates via action masking during RL fine-tuning.  

The framework operates in two phases:  

---

### 3.2.1 SafetyAdapter Architecture  
We define the SafetyAdapter as a sequence of bottleneck layers with learnable parameters $\Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^{d \times 2r}$, where $r \ll d$ (typically $r=64, d=768$). For a frozen VLM layer with input $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ and output $y \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$:  

$$
y = \text{VLM}_{\text{frozen}}(x) + \text{Adapter}_\Theta(x) = \text{VLM}_{\text{frozen}}(x) + W_2 \cdot \sigma(W_1 \cdot x)
$$

Here, $W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d}$, $W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ are learnable weight matrices, and $\sigma$ denotes the GELU activation. Adapters are initialized randomly, and the VLM backbone’s gradients are frozen during training.  

---

### 3.3 Contrastive Pre-Training on Offline Logs  
We pre-train the SafetyAdapter using a contrastive objective on a dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(v_i, l_i, s_i)\}_{i=1}^N$, where $v_i$ is a visual observation, $l_i$ is a linguistic instruction, and $s_i$ is a robot state vector (position, velocity). Positive pairs $(v_i, l_i, s_i)$ and $(v_j, l_j, s_j)$ share a task intention (e.g., "Pick up a red mug"), while negatives are sampled from other tasks.  

The contrastive loss maximizes the similarity between positive pairs while minimizing it for negatives in the joint embedding space:  

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{contr}} = -\log \frac{\exp(s(v_i, l_i, s_i) / \tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^K \exp(s(v_i, l_i, s_i^k) / \tau)}
$$

Here, $s(\cdot)$ computes cosine similarity, $\tau$ is a temperature hyperparameter, and $s_i^k$ are negative samples.  

---

### 3.4 Safe Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning  
After pre-training, the frozen VLM encodes semantic priors, while the SafetyAdapter learns policies under RL. Let $S \in \mathbb{R}^m$ be the robot’s state space and $A \in \mathbb{R}^n$ the action space. The policy is parameterized by $\pi_\phi: \mathcal{S} \to \Delta(\mathcal{A})$, where only $\phi$ (SafetyAdapter weights) are updated.  

#### SafetyCritic: Conservative Action Masking  
The SafetyCritic $C_\psi(S, A)$ predicts a risk score $c \in [0, 1]$, where $c > \epsilon$ indicates unsafe actions. During exploration, only actions $a$ satisfying $C_\psi(S, A) \leq \epsilon$ are permitted:  

$$
A_{\text{safe}} = \{a \in \mathcal{A} \mid C_\psi(S, a) \leq \epsilon\}
$$

The SafetyCritic is trained to minimize:  

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{crit}} = \mathbb{E}_{(S, A, R)\sim\mathcal{B}}[(C_\psi(S, A) - (||F(S_t) - G||_2))^\top D(S, A)]^2
$$

Here, $F(S_t)$ is the end-effector’s state, $G$ is a goal reference, $D(S, A)$ is a binary safety label (0 for collision, 1 otherwise), and $\mathcal{B}$ is the replay buffer.  

#### Policy Optimization with Conservative Q-Learning  
We optimize the policy using Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), which regularizes the Q-value to avoid overestimation of unseen actions:  

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{CQL}}(\theta) = \alpha \mathbb{E}_{S \sim \mathcal{B}, A \sim \pi_\phi}[\log \sum_{A'} \exp(Q_\theta(S, A') / \alpha)] - Q_\theta(S, A)
$$

This is combined with the SafetyCritic:  

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{CQL}}(\theta) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{crit}}(\psi)
$$

where $\lambda$ controls the safety constraint strength.  

### Experimental Design  
#### Datasets  
- **Training**: Offline multimodal logs from MetaWorld benchmarks and Google’s RT-2 dataset (videos + teleoperation trajectories).  
- **Evaluation**: KALIE’s open-world manipulation testbed (10 novel object categories) and a real-world UR5e robot.  

#### Baselines  
1. **Full fine-tuning**: Updating all VLM parameters without adapters.  
2. **Vanilla adapter**: Adapter-only approach without safety constraints.  
3. **Safe RL with random features**: Frozen VLM without contrastive pre-training.  

#### Metrics  
1. **Task success rate** over 100 trials.  
2. **Safety violations**: Collisions/time steps outside $A_{\text{safe}}$ regions.  
3. **Sample efficiency**: Number of real-world interactions to learn a policy.  
4. **Cross-domain generalization**: Performance on objects unseen during pre-training.

# Expected Outcomes & Impact  

## Anticipated Results  
1. **Rapid Adaptation**: Policy fine-tuning in <1 hour on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU with ≤ 1000 trials, compared to days for full fine-tuning.  
2. **Robust Generalization**: ≥85% success rate on KALIE’s 10 novel object categories, outperforming baselines by 15–20%.  
3. **Formal Safety Guarantees**: ≤1 collision per 1000 episodes during learning, validated via Lyapunov stability analysis of $C_\psi(S, A)$.  
4. **Modular Transparency**: SafetyAdapt3D’s static VLM backbone preserves semantic alignment (cosine similarity > 0.85) across tasks.  

## Broader Impact  
1. **Robotics**: Enables small labs to deploy vision–language models without cloud-scale compute, accelerating research in low-resource settings.  
2. **Computer Vision & NLP**: Establishes safe adaptation as a design principle for cross-modal models in safety-critical domains (e.g., self-driving cars).  
3. **Ethics & Safety**: Mitigates physical risks in human-robot interaction through learnable, interpretable safety constraints.  

## Addressing Literature Shortcomings  
By combining adapter-based fine-tuning (Sharma et al. 2023; KALIE 2024) with safe RL (Liu et al. 2023; Du et al. 2023), SafeAdapt3D resolves two key challenges:  
- It achieves data efficiency by reusing multimodal logs instead of collecting new robotic data (KALIE 2024).  
- It enforces safety guarantees via the SafetyCritic, unlike Skip Tuning (2024), which lacks exploration constraints.

# Conclusion  
SafeAdapt3D pioneers the integration of parameter-efficient adaptation and formal safety guarantees in vision–language robotics. By decomposing the problem into contrastive pre-training and shielded RL, this work bridges the gap between large pre-trained models and practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. Future extensions will explore multi-agent coordination and 3D point-cloud inputs for dynamic obstacle avoidance.
