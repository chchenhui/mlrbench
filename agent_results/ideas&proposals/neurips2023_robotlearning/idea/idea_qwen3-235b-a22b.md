1. **Title**: "Sparse Cross-Modal Adaptation: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multimodal Pretrained Models for Robotic Generalization"  

2. **Motivation**:  
Large pretrained models in robotics often require extensive fine-tuning for new tasks, which is computationally expensive and incompatible with resource-limited hardware. While multimodal pretraining (e.g., vision, language, proprioception) improves generalization, adapting these models to novel environments safely and efficiently remains a critical challenge. Existing methods that fine-tune all parameters are unsustainable for real-world deployment.  

3. **Main Idea**:  
We propose a **sparse cross-modal adaptation framework** that minimizes computational overhead while preserving generalization. During pretraining, a multimodal model learns joint representations from diverse robotic datasets (e.g., visual observations, language instructions, and motor states). For fine-tuning, a sparse attention mechanism identifies task-relevant cross-modal interactions (e.g., linking language to visual goals) and updates *only these pathways* via lightweight adapter modules, freezing the rest of the network. This reduces trainable parameters by 90%+ while retaining performance. We evaluate on robotic manipulation tasks with limited target-domain data, comparing generalization to full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines. Expected outcomes include faster adaptation, lower hardware requirements, and safer deployment through modular updates. This work bridges the gap between large-scale pretraining and practical robotics, enabling efficient transfer to real-world scenarios where data and compute are constrained.  

**Impact**: Democratizes access to pretrained models for robotics, reduces carbon footprint of fine-tuning, and advances safe, interpretable adaptation mechanisms.
