**Title:** Cross-Modal Adapters for Resource-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multimodal Robot Policies  

**Motivation:** Large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) offer strong generalization for robotic tasks, but adapting them to specific hardware and environments remains computationally prohibitive. Current fine-tuning strategies require extensive resources, limiting real-world deployment on robots with constrained hardware. This research addresses the critical need for efficient, adaptive fine-tuning that preserves generalization while minimizing compute and memory overhead.  

**Main Idea:** Propose lightweight *cross-modal adapter modules* inserted into frozen pretrained VLMs (e.g., CLIP or Flamingo-based architectures). These adapters—small neural layers added to vision and language branches—enable task-specific adaptation via minimal parameter updates. During fine-tuning, only the adapters and a slim policy head are trained, leveraging shared representations from the frozen backbone. Experiments will validate the approach on robotic manipulation and navigation tasks, measuring task performance, compute/memory use, and zero-shot generalization to unseen environments. Outcomes aim to match full fine-tuning accuracy with <5% tunable parameters, enabling on-device deployment. Impact includes democratizing large models for low-resource robotics while maintaining safety through stability of the frozen base model.
