**Title:** Ancestry-Invariant Polygenic Risk Scores via Invariant Risk Minimization  

**Motivation:** Polygenic risk scores (PRS) often fail to generalize across ancestries due to spurious correlations from European-biased training data, exacerbating healthcare disparities. Current methods lack explicit mechanisms to disentangle ancestry-specific confounders from true genetic signals, limiting clinical utility in diverse populations.  

**Main Idea:** Apply Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) to learn PRS models that capture stable genetic markers invariant across ancestry groups. By treating distinct populations as training "environments," IRM encourages the model to rely on genetic variants with consistent predictive effects across all groups, suppressing ancestry-specific spurious features. The framework integrates population structure metadata (e.g., principal components of genetic variation) to define environments and employs adversarial regularization to penalize ancestry-dependent predictions. Outcomes include improved PRS accuracy in underrepresented populations and interpretable identification of robust genetic variants. This approach bridges causal invariance principles with algorithmic fairness, offering a pathway to equitable precision medicine. Impact: Reduced healthcare disparities via ancestry-robust risk prediction models.
