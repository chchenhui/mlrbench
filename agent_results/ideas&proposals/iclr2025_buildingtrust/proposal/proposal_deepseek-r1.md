**Research Proposal: Self-Correcting Language Models: Automated Error Detection and Correction for Enhanced Trustworthiness**

---

### 1. Introduction

**Background**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing but face significant trustworthiness challenges, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare and legal advice. A critical issue is their tendency to generate plausible but factually incorrect or logically inconsistent outputs—a phenomenon termed "hallucination." Current solutions rely on post-hoc human verification, which is inefficient and unscalable. While recent work, such as SuperCorrect (Yang et al., 2024) and Intrinsic Self-Correction (Han et al., 2024), has explored self-correction mechanisms, these approaches often depend on external teacher models or lack domain adaptability. This proposal addresses these gaps by developing a framework that integrates intrinsic confidence estimation with retrieval-augmented correction, enabling LLMs to autonomously detect and rectify errors while balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

**Research Objectives**  
1. Develop an **internal confidence scorer** that identifies low-confidence spans in LLM outputs using self-attention patterns and uncertainty quantification.  
2. Design a **retrieval-augmented corrector** that refines errors by querying verified knowledge bases.  
3. Validate the framework’s ability to reduce hallucination rates by 30–50% on benchmarks like TruthfulQA and FEVER while maintaining real-time usability.  

**Significance**  
This research bridges the gap between foundational self-correction methods and practical deployment. By automating error detection and correction, the framework reduces reliance on human intervention, enhances scalability, and fosters trust in LLMs for critical applications. It also advances the theoretical understanding of uncertainty quantification in generative models and offers a modular architecture adaptable to diverse domains.

### 2. Methodology

#### 2.1 Research Design
The framework comprises two core components (Figure 1):  
1. **Internal Confidence Scorer**: Identifies uncertain spans in generated text.  
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Corrector**: Refines errors using external knowledge.  

**Figure 1: Framework Overview**  
```
Initial Response → Confidence Scoring → Error Detection → Retrieval → Correction → Final Output
```

#### 2.2 Data Collection  
- **Benchmarks**: TruthfulQA (factual accuracy), FEVER (fact verification), and custom datasets from healthcare/legal domains.  
- **Knowledge Bases**: Domain-specific sources (e.g., PubMed, legal corpora) and general-purpose databases (Wikipedia).  

#### 2.3 Algorithmic Steps  
1. **Initial Response Generation**:  
   Generate an initial response $R_0$ using the base LLM.  

2. **Confidence Scoring**:  
   For each token span $s$ in $R_0$, compute a confidence score $C(s)$ combining:  
   - **Token Entropy**: $H(p_s) = -\sum_{i} p_i \log p_i$, where $p_i$ is the probability of the $i$-th token.  
   - **Self-Attention Variance**: $\text{Var}(A_s) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N (A_{s,j} - \mu_s)^2$, measuring attention weight dispersion across $N$ layers.  
   The composite score is:  
   $$ C(s) = \alpha \cdot (1 - H(p_s)) + \beta \cdot (1 - \text{Var}(A_s)), $$  
   where $\alpha, \beta$ are tunable weights.  

3. **Error Detection**:  
   Flag spans with $C(s) < \theta$, where $\theta$ is a predefined threshold.  

4. **Retrieval-Augmented Correction**:  
   For each low-confidence span $s$:  
   - Compute its embedding $e_s$ using a contrastive encoder.  
   - Retrieve top-$k$ documents $D = \{d_1, ..., d_k\}$ from the knowledge base using cosine similarity:  
     $$ \text{sim}(e_s, e_d) = \frac{e_s \cdot e_d}{\|e_s\| \|e_d\|}. $$  
   - Generate a corrected span $s'$ by conditioning the LLM on $D$ and the original context.  

5. **Iterative Refinement**:  
   Repeat steps 2–4 until all spans meet $C(s) \geq \theta$ or a maximum iteration limit is reached.  

#### 2.4 Experimental Design  
- **Baselines**: Compare against SuperCorrect (Yang et al., 2024), ISC (Han et al., 2024), and STaSC (Moskvoretskii et al., 2025).  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Accuracy**: Error reduction rate, precision/recall of error detection.  
  - **Efficiency**: Latency per iteration, FLOPs, memory usage.  
  - **Human Evaluation**: Correctness, fluency, and coherence (5-point Likert scale).  
- **Ablation Studies**: Test contributions of confidence scoring components (entropy vs. attention variance) and retrieval strategies.

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. A 30–50% reduction in hallucination rates on TruthfulQA and FEVER compared to baseline methods.  
2. Quantifiable trade-offs between accuracy and computational overhead (e.g., <20% latency increase per correction iteration).  
3. Open-source implementation of the framework, including pre-trained confidence scoring models.  

**Impact**  
- **Practical**: Enables deployment of trustworthy LLMs in healthcare, legal, and education sectors, where errors carry significant consequences.  
- **Theoretical**: Advances understanding of self-correction mechanisms through uncertainty quantification and retrieval-augmented generation.  
- **Societal**: Reduces misinformation risks and fosters public confidence in AI systems.

### 4. Conclusion  
This proposal addresses a critical challenge in modern AI: ensuring the reliability of LLMs without compromising their generative capabilities. By integrating confidence scoring with evidence-based correction, the framework offers a scalable solution to hallucination, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy language models. The results will be disseminated through publications, open-source tools, and collaborations with industry partners to maximize real-world impact.
