1. **Title**: Proactive Error Detection and Self-Correction for Language Models via Multi-Agent Anomaly Tracking  

2. **Motivation**:  
Modern LLMs often propagate subtle errors in real-time applications, leading to cascading risks in critical domains (e.g., healthcare, legal, finance). Current error detection largely relies on post-hoc analysis or static criteria, failing to address dynamic user interactions and context-dependent mistakes. Developing a proactive, context-aware system for real-time error identification and correction is crucial to ensure reliability and user trust in high-stakes deployments.  

3. **Main Idea**:  
Propose **TRACE (Trustworthy Response Assurance through Collaborative Evaluation)**, a multi-agent framework where LLM outputs are monitored by specialized "guardian agents" focusing on distinct error types (factual inconsistencies, logical flaws, regulatory non-compliance). Each guardian evaluates outputs using hybrid signals:  
- *Anomaly detection* via contrastive decoding (e.g., cross-checking responses across multiple model sampling paths).  
- *Contextual knowledge verification* through integration with external knowledge graphs or domain-specific ontologies.  
- *Regulatory alignment checks* using interpretable rule-based systems trained on compliance policies (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).  
When inconsistencies are flagged, a reinforcement learning module triggers adversarial re-generation to refine outputs under constrained error correction. Key innovations include dynamic error prioritization (e.g., severe errors halt responses) and human-in-the-loop verification for feedback-driven improvement. Expected outcomes: 1) 30â€“50% reduction in critical errors compared to static methods, 2) real-time latency under 100ms, and 3) publicly available benchmark for dynamic error detection evaluation. TRACE bridges the gap between risk mitigation and operational scalability in LLM applications.
