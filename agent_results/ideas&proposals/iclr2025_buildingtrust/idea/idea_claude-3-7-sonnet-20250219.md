# Trust Calibration Framework for Explainable LLM Responses

## Motivation
As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to critical applications, users often lack a clear understanding of when to trust model outputs. Current explainability approaches typically focus on how a decision was made rather than whether users should trust it in specific contexts. This research addresses the urgent need for calibrated trust in LLM responses - helping users appropriately trust model outputs when they are reliable and maintain skepticism when they are not. Uncalibrated trust can lead to dangerous overreliance or unnecessary distrust, both of which limit the practical utility of LLMs in high-stakes environments.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel trust calibration framework that dynamically adjusts explanations based on model confidence and task criticality. The framework integrates multiple explainability techniques (attribution methods, counterfactual explanations, and reasoning traces) with uncertainty estimates to generate context-aware trust signals. For high-confidence predictions in low-risk scenarios, streamlined explanations are provided. For uncertain predictions or high-stakes contexts, the system presents more comprehensive explanations, alternative viewpoints, and explicit uncertainty indicators. The framework includes a feedback loop where user interactions refine the calibration mechanism over time. By matching explanation complexity to the appropriate trust level required, this approach helps prevent both blind acceptance of unreliable outputs and unnecessary skepticism toward valid responses, ultimately enabling more responsible and effective human-LLM collaboration.
