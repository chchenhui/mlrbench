### Title: Enhancing Trustworthiness of Language Models through Explainable AI

### Motivation:
The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various industries has raised significant concerns regarding their trustworthiness, reliability, and ethical implications. Ensuring that LLMs are trustworthy is crucial, especially as they become integral components of real-world applications. This research aims to address the challenges of explainability and interpretability, which are key factors in building trust in LLMs.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research focuses on developing a framework for enhancing the explainability of Language Models (LMs) using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The primary objective is to create interpretable models that can provide clear and understandable explanations for their outputs, thereby improving trust and reliability.

**Methodology:**
1. **Model Selection and Preprocessing:** Choose a baseline LLM and preprocess the data to ensure quality and relevance.
2. **Explainability Techniques:** Implement XAI techniques such as LIME, SHAP, and attention mechanisms to interpret the model's outputs.
3. **Evaluation Metrics:** Develop and use metrics to evaluate the interpretability and trustworthiness of the models, such as BLEU, ROUGE, and user satisfaction surveys.
4. **User Interaction:** Conduct user studies to assess the effectiveness of the explanations and gather feedback on the model's trustworthiness.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- A framework that improves the explainability of LLMs.
- Increased user trust and satisfaction in LLM-driven applications.
- Enhanced reliability and truthfulness of LM outputs.

**Potential Impact:**
This research will contribute to the broader goal of making LLMs more trustworthy and reliable. By providing clear explanations for LM outputs, users can better understand and trust the models, leading to more effective and ethical use in various applications.
