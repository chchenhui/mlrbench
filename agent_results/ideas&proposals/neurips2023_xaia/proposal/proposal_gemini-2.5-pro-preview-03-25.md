## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **MetaXplain: Meta-Learned Transferable Explanation Modules for Cross-Domain Explainable AI**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
The proliferation of complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models across critical sectors such as healthcare, finance, natural science, and law has been transformative. However, the increasing sophistication, often manifesting as "black-box" behaviour, presents significant challenges related to trust, accountability, fairness, and transparency (Saeed & Omlin, 2021). Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a crucial field dedicated to developing methods that render AI decisions understandable to humans. Techniques like LIME, SHAP, attention mechanisms, and concept-based explanations provide valuable insights into model behaviour.

Despite the growing arsenal of XAI tools, a major bottleneck persists: many state-of-the-art explanation methods are heavily tailored to specific data modalities (e.g., images, text, tabular data) or application domains (Adadi & Berrada, 2018). Applying an XAI technique developed for medical image analysis to, for instance, financial time-series prediction or natural language processing often requires substantial re-engineering, domain expertise, and potentially large amounts of domain-specific annotated data (e.g., human-provided rationales, feature importance scores). This domain-specificity significantly hinders the rapid and cost-effective deployment of reliable XAI solutions in new or emerging fields, limiting the scalability and widespread adoption of trustworthy AI. The workshop task description highlights this challenge, emphasizing the need to understand XAI applications across diverse areas and identify strategies to extend the frontiers of applied XAI, including exploring the transferability of insights.

**2.2 Research Gap and Problem Statement**
The current landscape of XAI application often involves developing bespoke solutions for each new problem or domain. This practice is inefficient, resource-intensive, and creates inconsistencies in how interpretability is achieved and evaluated across different fields. While some XAI methods are model-agnostic (e.g., LIME, SHAP), their effective application and the interpretation of their outputs can still be domain-dependent. Furthermore, generating high-quality explanations often relies on annotated data (e.g., expert-defined salient features), which can be scarce or expensive to obtain, especially in novel domains (Key Challenge 2).

Recent advancements in meta-learning, particularly "learning to learn" paradigms like Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) (Finn et al., 2017), offer a promising avenue to address this challenge. Meta-learning aims to train models on a variety of learning tasks such that they can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. While meta-learning has been explored for XAI in specific contexts, such as improving GNN explainability (Spinelli et al., 2021) or meta-learning recommendations (Shao et al., 2022), and conceptually proposed for few-shot XAI (Lit. Review #5, #9) and transferable modules (Lit. Review #6, #8, #10), a comprehensive framework demonstrating effective *cross-domain transfer* of explanation capabilities using gradient-based meta-learning is still lacking. The key research problem is: **Can we leverage meta-learning to train a universal explanation model that rapidly adapts to provide high-fidelity explanations for AI models across diverse domains with minimal domain-specific data and tuning?** This directly addresses the challenge of domain-specific tailoring (Key Challenge 1) and the transferability of explanation modules (Key Challenge 5).

**2.3 Research Objectives**
This research proposes **MetaXplain**, a novel framework based on gradient-based meta-learning, designed to learn transferable explanation patterns across multiple source domains. The primary goal is to develop a base explainer model that can be quickly fine-tuned to generate reliable explanations for AI models in unseen target domains using few-shot learning.

The specific objectives are:
1.  **Develop the MetaXplain Framework:** Design and implement a gradient-based meta-learning framework (inspired by MAML) capable of training a universal explainer model using data from multiple diverse source domains. This includes defining appropriate meta-task structures and loss functions tailored for explanation generation.
2.  **Curate Multi-Domain XAI Datasets:** Collect and preprocess datasets from 3-5 distinct source domains (e.g., healthcare imaging, financial risk assessment, sentiment analysis in NLP). Each dataset must include model inputs, corresponding model predictions, and ground-truth or proxy-ground-truth explanations (e.g., expert-annotated saliency maps, human-verified feature importance scores, attention weights aligned with rationales).
3.  **Train the MetaXplain Base Model:** Execute the meta-training process on the curated multi-domain datasets to obtain a generalized base explainer model initialized for rapid adaptation.
4.  **Evaluate Cross-Domain Adaptability:** Assess the performance of the MetaXplain model on 2-3 unseen target domains. Evaluation will focus on:
    *   **Adaptation Speed:** Measure the number of examples (shots) and/or fine-tuning steps required to achieve a target level of explanation fidelity on the new domain.
    *   **Explanation Fidelity:** Quantify the quality of the generated explanations using established XAI evaluation metrics (e.g., faithfulness, plausibility) compared to baseline methods.
    *   **Reduced Annotation Burden:** Demonstrate the ability to achieve high fidelity with significantly fewer ground-truth explanations in the target domain compared to training from scratch.
5.  **Benchmark against Baselines:** Compare MetaXplain's performance against relevant baselines, including: (a) training domain-specific explainers from scratch, (b) standard transfer learning (fine-tuning a model pre-trained on a single source domain or a simple aggregation of source domains without meta-learning), and (c) potentially applying established model-agnostic methods like LIME/SHAP configured for each target domain.

**2.4 Significance**
This research directly addresses several key challenges highlighted in the literature review and the workshop scope. By developing MetaXplain, we aim to:
*   **Accelerate XAI Deployment:** Enable organizations to rapidly deploy interpretable AI models in new and emerging application areas by significantly reducing the time, cost, and data required for developing domain-specific explainers.
*   **Promote Consistency in Explanation:** Foster more consistent standards and methodologies for AI explainability across different industries and applications by leveraging shared, transferable explanation patterns.
*   **Democratize Trustworthy AI:** Lower the barrier to entry for implementing XAI, making trustworthy AI more accessible, particularly for smaller organizations or in fields where XAI expertise or annotated data is limited.
*   **Advance Meta-Learning for XAI:** Contribute novel techniques and empirical evidence to the intersection of meta-learning and Explainable AI, specifically validating the feasibility of cross-domain transfer for explanation generation.
*   **Inform XAI Best Practices:** Provide insights into which explanation patterns are universal versus domain-specific, potentially guiding the development of more robust and generalizable XAI methods and evaluation protocols, touching upon the challenge of evaluating explanation quality (Key Challenge 4) by testing fidelity across diverse settings. This work directly explores the transferability mentioned in the workshop topics.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Research Design**
This research employs a quantitative experimental design centered around the development and evaluation of the MetaXplain framework. The core methodology is gradient-based meta-learning, specifically adopting a MAML-style approach (Finn et al., 2017). The design involves three main phases: Data Curation and Preparation, Meta-Training, and Meta-Testing/Evaluation.

**3.2 Data Collection and Preparation**
We will assemble a meta-dataset comprising data from 3-5 diverse source domains and 2-3 distinct target domains for evaluation. Potential source domains include:
1.  **Healthcare (Imaging):** Dataset like CheXpert (Irvin et al., 2019) or MIMIC-CXR (Johnson et al., 2019). Inputs: Chest X-rays. Task: Disease classification (e.g., pneumonia, cardiomegaly). Pre-trained Classifier: A CNN (e.g., ResNet) trained for the classification task. Explanations: Expert-annotated saliency maps highlighting relevant pathology, or proxy ground truths generated using methods like Grad-CAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017) verified for plausibility.
2.  **Finance (Tabular):** Dataset like the FICO Explainable Machine Learning Challenge dataset or LendingClub loan data. Inputs: Tabular data (applicant features). Task: Credit risk prediction. Pre-trained Classifier: A Gradient Boosting Machine (e.g., XGBoost) or MLP. Explanations: Feature importance scores derived from methods like SHAP (Lundberg & Lee, 2017), potentially validated by financial experts or regulatory guidelines for key risk factors.
3.  **Natural Language Processing (Text):** Dataset like Stanford Sentiment Treebank (Socher et al., 2013) or IMDB movie reviews. Inputs: Text sequences. Task: Sentiment classification. Pre-trained Classifier: A Transformer-based model (e.g., BERT) or LSTM. Explanations: Attention weights (if applicable and aligned with human rationales) or token/word importance scores generated via LIME or Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2017), potentially verified against human-provided rationales.
4.  **(Optional) Natural Science (e.g., Genomics):** Datasets involving gene expression data for disease prediction. Explanations could be gene importance scores.
5.  **(Optional) Auditing/Fraud Detection:** Transaction data with fraud labels. Explanations could highlight features indicative of fraud.

**Target Domains:** We will reserve datasets from 2-3 distinct domains not used during meta-training. Examples could include:
1.  **Law (Text):** Legal document classification (e.g., contract type). Explanations: Highlighting key clauses/phrases.
2.  **Computer Vision (Non-Medical):** Object recognition or scene classification (e.g., on ImageNet subset or COCO). Explanations: Saliency maps for recognized objects.
3.  **Time Series Analysis:** Anomaly detection in sensor data. Explanations: Highlighting time steps or features contributing to anomaly score.

**Data Structure:** For each data point across all domains, we need a tuple $(x, y, M(x), e)$, where $x$ is the input, $y$ is the ground-truth label for the original task (optional for the explainer but useful context), $M(x)$ is the prediction of the pre-trained model $M$ for which we want an explanation, and $e$ is the ground-truth or proxy-ground-truth explanation (e.g., a saliency map, feature importance vector). Explanations $e$ will be normalized or standardized into a consistent format where possible (e.g., vectors of feature attributions, heatmaps normalized to [0, 1]).

**3.3 The MetaXplain Framework**

*   **Meta-Task Definition:** A meta-task $\mathcal{T}_i$ corresponds to learning to explain the predictions of a specific pre-trained model $M_i$ on data from domain $i$. Each task $\mathcal{T}_i$ is associated with a dataset $D_i = \{(x_j, M_i(x_j), e_j)\}$. During meta-training, tasks are sampled from the set of source domains.
*   **Base Explainer Model ($\mathcal{E}_{\theta}$):** We will design a neural network architecture, $\mathcal{E}_{\theta}$, parameterized by $\theta$, that takes the model input $x$ and potentially the model's prediction $M(x)$ or internal states (if available and desired, though we aim for model-agnosticism where $M$ is treated as a black-box or grey-box) and outputs a predicted explanation $\hat{e} = \mathcal{E}_{\theta}(x, M(x))$. The architecture must be flexible enough to handle different input modalities (or use modality-specific encoders feeding into a common explanation core). For instance, CNN layers for images, embedding layers + LSTMs/Transformers for text, and MLPs for tabular data, potentially mapping to a shared latent space before the final explanation output layers.
*   **Meta-Learning Algorithm (MAML-based):**
    1.  Initialize the parameters $\theta$ of the base explainer $\mathcal{E}_{\theta}$.
    2.  **Outer Loop:** Repeat for a number of meta-iterations:
        a.  Sample a batch of tasks $\{\mathcal{T}_i\}$ from the source domains $p(\mathcal{T})$.
        b.  **Inner Loop (for each sampled task $\mathcal{T}_i$):**
            i.  Sample a small support set $D_i^{tr} = \{(x_j, e_j)\}_{j=1}^K$ from the task's data $D_i$.
            ii. Compute the task-specific adapted parameters $\theta'_i$ by taking one or more gradient descent steps on the support set $D_i^{tr}$ using an explanation fidelity loss $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}$:
                $$ \theta'_i = \theta - \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(\mathcal{E}_{\theta}, D_i^{tr}) $$
                where $\alpha$ is the inner loop learning rate. The loss function $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}$ measures the discrepancy between the predicted explanations $\hat{e}_j = \mathcal{E}_{\theta}(x_j, M_i(x_j))$ and the ground-truth explanations $e_j$. A common choice could be Mean Squared Error (MSE) for continuous explanations (saliency maps, feature importances) or cross-entropy for categorical explanations (e.g., selecting top-k features):
                $$ \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(\mathcal{E}_{\theta}, D_i^{tr}) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{j=1}^K || \mathcal{E}_{\theta}(x_j, M_i(x_j)) - e_j ||_2^2 \quad \text{(Example: MSE Loss)} $$
        c.  **Meta-Update:** Update the initial parameters $\theta$ by summing the gradients of the loss computed on query sets $D_i^{qry}$ (sampled independently from $D_i$) using the adapted parameters $\theta'_i$.
            $$ \theta \leftarrow \theta - \beta \nabla_{\theta} \sum_{\mathcal{T}_i \sim p(\mathcal{T})} \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(\mathcal{E}_{\theta'_i}, D_i^{qry}) $$
            where $\beta$ is the outer loop learning rate (meta-learning rate).
*   **Adaptation Phase (Few-Shot Fine-tuning):** Given the meta-trained parameters $\theta$, and a new task $\mathcal{T}_{new}$ from an unseen target domain with a small K-shot support set $D_{new}^{tr}$, the model is fine-tuned for a few gradient steps using the inner loop update rule:
    $$ \theta'_{new} = \theta - \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_{new}}(\mathcal{E}_{\theta}, D_{new}^{tr}) $$
    The resulting model $\mathcal{E}_{\theta'_{new}}$ is then used to generate explanations for new instances from the target domain.

**3.4 Experimental Design**

*   **Datasets:** As specified in 3.2. We will clearly define the splits for meta-training (source domains), meta-validation (for hyperparameter tuning, potentially holding out some data from source domains), and meta-testing (unseen target domains). For adaptation, we will experiment with varying numbers of shots $K$ (e.g., K=1, 5, 10, 50).
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  *Scratch:* Train an explainer model $\mathcal{E}_{\phi}$ from random initialization solely on the K-shot support set $D_{new}^{tr}$ of the target task.
    2.  *Finetune-Aggregate:* Pre-train an explainer $\mathcal{E}_{\phi}$ on the aggregated data from all source domains, then fine-tune on the K-shot support set $D_{new}^{tr}$.
    3.  *Domain-Specific XAI Methods:* Where applicable and feasible, generate explanations using established methods (e.g., SHAP for tabular, Grad-CAM for CNNs, LIME for text) configured for the target domain's model $M_{new}$. These serve as a reference for state-of-the-art explanation quality in that domain, though they don't involve learning an explainer model in the same way.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Adaptation Speed:** Measure the number of fine-tuning steps or wall-clock time required for MetaXplain and baselines to reach a pre-defined threshold of explanation fidelity on a validation set from the target domain. Also, report performance improvement per K shots.
    *   **Explanation Fidelity (Quantitative):** Depending on the domain and explanation type:
        *   *Faithfulness:* Metrics like Deletion AUC / Insertion AUC (Petsiuk et al., 2018) – measuring model performance drop/gain when removing/adding features based on importance scores. Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency (DeYoung et al., 2020). These metrics assess how well the explanation reflects the model's reasoning process. The choice of reliable metrics can be informed by frameworks like MetaQuantus (Hedström et al., 2023).
        *   *Similarity to Ground Truth:* If reliable ground-truth explanations $e$ are available (e.g., human annotations), use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Cosine Similarity, Intersection over Union (IoU) for saliency maps, or Rank Correlation (Spearman's rho) for feature importance rankings between $\hat{e}$ and $e$.
    *   **Human Interpretability (Qualitative):** Conduct small-scale user studies (e.g., using domain experts or trained annotators if possible, otherwise crowd-sourcing with clear instructions). Users will be presented with explanations generated by MetaXplain and baseline methods for instances from the target domains and asked to rate them on scales for:
        *   *Clarity:* Is the explanation easy to understand?
        *   *Plausibility:* Does the explanation align with domain knowledge or human intuition?
        *   *Trustworthiness:* Does the explanation increase confidence in the model's prediction?
        *   *Usefulness:* Does the explanation provide actionable insights?
    *   **Computational Efficiency:** Report meta-training time, adaptation time (per task), and inference time for generating an explanation.

**3.5 Implementation Details**
The framework will be implemented using Python with standard ML libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow, which have robust support for automatic differentiation and meta-learning libraries (e.g., higher, learn2learn). Experiments will be conducted on GPU clusters to handle the computational demands of meta-training deep learning models. Code will be made publicly available upon publication.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**
We anticipate the following outcomes from this research:
1.  **A Functional MetaXplain Framework:** A robust, implemented, and validated meta-learning framework for training transferable explanation modules.
2.  **Demonstrated Rapid Adaptation:** Quantitative evidence showing that MetaXplain achieves target explanation fidelity on unseen domains significantly faster (e.g., requiring 5x fewer labelled examples or fine-tuning steps, as hypothesized) compared to training from scratch or standard fine-tuning baselines.
3.  **High Explanation Fidelity:** Evidence that MetaXplain, after few-shot adaptation, produces explanations with fidelity comparable or potentially superior (due to learned generalization) to domain-specific baseline methods trained with significantly more data. This will be validated through quantitative metrics and human evaluations.
4.  **Reduced Annotation Effort:** Demonstration that high-quality explanations can be generated in new domains with substantially reduced need for domain-specific ground-truth explanation annotations, directly addressing Key Challenge 2 (Data Scarcity).
5.  **Insights into Explanation Transferability:** Analysis of the results will shed light on the extent to which explanation "patterns" or "strategies" are transferable across different domains and data modalities, contributing insights relevant to the workshop's goal of understanding cross-use-case knowledge transfer. We may identify which types of explanations or which domain similarities facilitate transfer.
6.  **Publications and Open Source Code:** Peer-reviewed publications detailing the framework and findings, along with publicly released code and potentially curated benchmark datasets/tasks for meta-learning XAI.

**4.2 Potential Impact**
The MetaXplain framework has the potential for significant impact:
*   **Practical Deployment:** It offers a practical solution for organizations needing to implement XAI across diverse AI applications without the prohibitive costs and time typically associated with developing custom solutions for each. This directly supports the application focus of the workshop.
*   **Standardization and Trust:** By promoting the use of a common, adaptable core for explanation generation, MetaXplain could contribute to more standardized and reliable XAI practices across industries, fostering greater trust in AI systems.
*   **Enabling XAI in Resource-Constrained Settings:** The reduced data requirement makes trustworthy AI accessible to a wider range of users and application areas, including those with limited data or resources for annotation.
*   **Research Advancement:** This work pushes the boundary of both meta-learning (by applying it to the complex task of explanation generation across highly diverse domains) and XAI (by providing a novel, scalable approach to building interpretable systems). It addresses fundamental questions about the generalizability and transferability of explanations.
*   **Addressing Workshop Themes:** The project directly tackles several workshop themes: examining new applications of XAI (by enabling deployment in novel domains), identifying and overcoming obstacles (domain specificity, data scarcity), exploring methodological requirements (meta-learning framework), and investigating cross-use-case transferability.

In conclusion, MetaXplain represents a significant step towards scalable, efficient, and consistent AI explainability. By leveraging the power of meta-learning, this research aims to bridge the gap between the growing need for XAI and the practical challenges of applying it across the ever-expanding landscape of AI applications.
