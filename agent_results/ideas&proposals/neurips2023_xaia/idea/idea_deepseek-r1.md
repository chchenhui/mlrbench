**Title:** Cross-Domain Transferability of Explainable AI Methods: Enhancing Adaptability and Impact  

**Motivation:** XAI methods are often siloed within their original domains (e.g., healthcare or law), limiting their broader utility. Understanding whether insights from one domain can enhance XAI in others could reduce redundant research, accelerate adoption, and address cross-cutting challenges like fairness and trust.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a systematic evaluation of XAI method transferability across domains. Using case studies (e.g., applying healthcare-focused XAI to legal NLP systems), the project would analyze adaptability by measuring explanation fidelity, user trust, and task performance. A novel framework would be developed to identify transferable components (e.g., feature attribution techniques) and domain-specific constraints (e.g., regulatory requirements). Methods would be tested via hybrid benchmarks combining synthetic and real-world datasets. Expected outcomes include a taxonomy of transferable XAI elements, guidelines for cross-domain adaptation, and open-source tools for evaluating explanation robustness. This could streamline XAI deployment in emerging domains like climate science or education, while exposing limitations (e.g., contextual biases) that hinder generalization.
