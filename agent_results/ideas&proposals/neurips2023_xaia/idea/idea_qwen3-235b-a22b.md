**Title**: Transferable XAI: Cross-Domain Explainability Frameworks for Generalizable Insights  

**Motivation**: Despite progress in XAI methods, domain-specific applications remain fragmented, leading to redundant efforts and opaque "explanation silos." For example, a technique to explain medical diagnostics may not adapt to legal reasoning, limiting scalability. This disconnect obscures universal principles of effective explainability and hinders adoption in new domains. Developing cross-domain frameworks could unify insights, reduce redundant development, and address challenges like fairness in auditing or interpretability in NLP, which share underlying issues of transparency and bias.  

**Main Idea**: Propose a meta-explainability framework that identifies transferable patterns across XAI applications (e.g., feature importance in healthcare vs. fairness auditing). The method involves: (1) Constructing a "knowledge graph" mapping input-output explanations from diverse domains, annotated with contextual constraints (e.g., regulatory requirements in law vs. clinical validity in healthcare). (2) Training a cross-domain explanation generator using causal reasoning and contrastive learning to adapt explanations to new domains. (3) Validating generalizability through case studies (e.g., transferring bias explanations from NLP to hiring algorithms). Expected outcomes include a toolkit for domain-agnostic explanation templates and benchmarks for measuring transferability. Impact: Reducing ad-hoc implementation costs, enabling rapid deployment of XAI in emerging domains (e.g., climate modeling), and fostering dialogue between fields to address shared challenges like causal fidelity vs. simplicity trade-offs.
