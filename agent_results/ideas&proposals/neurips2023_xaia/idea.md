Title: MetaXplain – Meta-Learned Transferable Explanation Modules  

Motivation: Modern XAI methods are often tailored to specific domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, NLP), requiring costly re-engineering when applied elsewhere. A meta-learning approach can capture shared “explanation patterns” across diverse fields, dramatically reducing the effort and data needed to deploy XAI in novel use cases.  

Main Idea: We propose MetaXplain, a gradient-based meta-learning framework that trains a universal explainer across multiple source domains (healthcare imaging, financial risk models, NLP classifiers).  

Methodology:
1. Collect paired datasets of model inputs, outputs, and expert annotations (saliency maps, feature importance) from 3–5 domains.  
2. Use MAML-style meta-training to learn a base explainer model that rapidly adapts to new domains with few-shot fine-tuning.  
3. Evaluate on two unseen domains, measuring adaptation speed, explanation fidelity (e.g., faithfulness metrics), and human interpretability.  

Expected Outcomes:
- 5× faster adaptation to new domains  
- Comparable or higher fidelity explanations versus domain-specific baselines  
- Reduced annotation burden  

Potential Impact: MetaXplain will enable organizations to spin up trustworthy, interpretable AI in emerging fields—accelerating XAI adoption and ensuring consistent transparency standards across industries.
