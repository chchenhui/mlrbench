Title: Federated Graph Meta-Learning for Precision Drug Dosage Optimization

Motivation:  
Inadequate dosing is a key source of adverse reactions and therapeutic failures. Personalizing drug dosage by accounting for genetics, comorbidities, and real-world treatment responses can improve outcomes, but pooling multi-center patient data is hindered by privacy concerns and domain shifts.

Main Idea:  
We propose a federated graph meta-learning framework that (1) represents each patient as a node-attributed graph encoding EHR features (demographics, labs, comorbidities), genomic variants, and PK/PD biomarkers, (2) trains local graph neural network (GNN) dose-response predictors under a secure aggregation protocol, and (3) meta-learns shared initialization parameters to rapidly adapt to new centers or subpopulations with few-shot fine-tuning. Privacy is preserved via secure multi-party aggregation and differential privacy noise. Expected outcomes include improved dosage accuracy, reduced adverse events, and robust generalization across hospitals. This approach paves the way for scalable, privacy-preserving precision dosing in clinical practice.
