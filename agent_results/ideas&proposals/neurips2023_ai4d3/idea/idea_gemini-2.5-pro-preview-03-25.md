**Title:** Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Precision Drug Dosage

**Motivation:** Determining optimal drug dosages is challenging due to high inter-patient variability in response and toxicity. Fixed dosing regimens often lead to suboptimal outcomes. This research aims to develop a system that learns personalized, adaptive dosing strategies to maximize efficacy while minimizing adverse effects.

**Main Idea:** We propose using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to dynamically adjust drug dosages. The RL agent's state will integrate patient-specific data (e.g., genomics, demographics, comorbidities) and time-varying clinical measurements (e.g., biomarkers, vital signs, reported side effects). Actions correspond to dosage adjustments (increase, decrease, maintain). The reward function will be carefully designed to balance therapeutic benefit (e.g., disease marker improvement) against safety risks (e.g., toxicity levels). We will train the agent using simulated patient trajectories derived from pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models and potentially refine it on retrospective clinical data. The expected outcome is an AI-driven policy that suggests personalized, time-varying dosages, potentially improving treatment outcomes compared to standard protocols, especially for drugs with narrow therapeutic indices.
