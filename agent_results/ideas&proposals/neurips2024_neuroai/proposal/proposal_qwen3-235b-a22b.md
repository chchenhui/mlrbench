# **Predictive Coding-Driven Active Inference for Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning**

## **1. Introduction**

### **Background**  
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in complex tasks such as game playing (AlphaGo, DQN) and robotic control (PPO, SAC). However, RL agents typically demand millions of environmental interactions to converge, starkly contrasting with the data efficiency observed in biological systems. Humans and animals learn effectively from sparse feedback, adaptively explore novel environments, and generalize knowledge across tasks. This discrepancy motivates the integration of neurobiologically plausible principles into RL to close the gap between artificial and natural intelligence.

Predictive coding and active inference—key theories in computational neuroscience—offer a compelling framework to address this challenge. Predictive coding posits that biological systems minimize *prediction errors* by continuously refining hierarchical internal models of the environment. Active inference extends this principle to action selection, where agents not only passively update beliefs but also actively seek sensory inputs that minimize expected *free energy*—a measure of uncertainty and surprise. By aligning RL with these principles, we aim to develop agents that inherently prioritize exploration in high-uncertainty regions, enabling efficient learning in sparse-reward regimes.

### **Research Objectives**  
1. **Design** a neuro-inspired RL framework that combines hierarchical predictive coding with active inference for simultaneous policy and world model optimization.  
2. **Implement** a biologically plausible algorithm where actions are selected to minimize expected free energy while maximizing cumulative reward.  
3. **Evaluate** the sample efficiency and performance of the proposed framework on environments requiring complex exploration and sparse rewards, benchmarked against state-of-the-art RL algorithms (e.g., SAC, DQN, SPEQ).  
4. **Analyze** the theoretical and empirical relationship between prediction error minimization, exploration strategies, and policy generalization.  

### **Significance**  
This research bridges NeuroAI and practical RL by:  
1. **Improving Data Efficiency**: Reducing the environmental interaction burden of RL, enabling deployment in real-world systems (e.g., robotics, healthcare) where data collection is costly.  
2. **Enhancing Explainability**: Hierarchical predictive coding provides interpretable latent representations aligned with neuroscientific theories of perception and decision-making.  
3. **Advancing NeuroAI**: The framework advances the synergy between neuroscience and AI by operationalizing predictive coding and active inference in artificial systems.  
4. **Inspiring Novel Applications**: Potential applications include energy-constrained neuromorphic hardware (e.g., Intel Loihi), low-bandwidth autonomous systems, and human-aligned AI development.

## **2. Methodology**

### **2.1 Framework Overview**  
The proposed framework integrates hierarchical predictive coding with active inference, forming a dual-objective RL system (Figure 1). The architecture consists of:  
1. **Hierarchical Predictive Coding Network (HPCN)**: A multi-layered model that learns temporally coherent latent representations by minimizing prediction errors between successive observations.  
2. **Active Inference Policy Network (AIPN)**: A policy module that selects actions to balance reward maximization and free energy minimization.  

**Key Components**:  
- **Hierarchical World Model**: At each layer $ l $, the HPCN predicts the latent state $ \hat{\mathbf{z}}^{(l)} $ of the lower layer using top-down feedback:  
  $$
  \hat{\mathbf{z}}^{(l)} = f_{\text{top-down}}^{(l)}(\mathbf{z}^{(l+1)}; \theta^{(l)}_{\text{top-down}}),
  $$
  where $ \theta^{(l)} $ are parameters. Prediction errors $ \epsilon^{(l)} = \|\mathbf{z}^{(l)} - \hat{\mathbf{z}}^{(l)}\|^2 $ propagate upward to refine higher-level predictions.  

- **Free Energy Functional**: Following Friston’s free energy principle, the agent minimizes:  
  $$
  \mathcal{F}(t) = \sum_{l=1}^L \lambda^{(l)} \|\mathbf{z}^{(l)}(t) - \hat{\mathbf{z}}^{(l)}(t)\|^2,
  $$
  where $ \lambda^{(l)} $ are layer-specific weights. The total loss combines free energy and reward maximization:  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \alpha \mathcal{F}(t) - \beta \mathbb{E}[R(t)],
  $$
  with hyperparameters $ \alpha, \beta $.  

### **2.2 Algorithmic Details**  
**Training Process**:  
1. **Forward Pass**:  
   - Encode observations $ \mathbf{x}(t) $ into hierarchical latents $ \mathbf{z}^{(1)}(t), \mathbf{z}^{(2)}(t), \dots $.  
   - Predict next-state latents $ \hat{\mathbf{z}}^{(l)}(t+1) $ using a transition function:  
     $$
     \hat{\mathbf{z}}^{(l)}(t+1) = f_{\text{trans}}^{(l)}(\mathbf{z}^{(l)}(t), \mathbf{a}(t); \theta^{(l)}_{\text{trans}}).
     $$  
2. **Action Selection**:  
   - Compute expected free energy $ G(a) $ for candidate actions $ a \in \mathcal{A} $:  
     $$
     G(a) = \mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{z}(t+1)|\mathbf{z}(t), a)} \left[ \mathcal{F}(t+1) \right].
     $$  
   - Select action:  
     $$
     \mathbf{a}(t) = \arg\min_a \left( G(a) - \eta Q(s, a) \right),
     $$
     where $ Q(s,a) $ is the reward value function and $ \eta $ balances exploration vs. exploitation.  

3. **Backward Pass**:  
   - Update HPCN parameters via gradient descent on $ \mathcal{F}(t) $.  
   - Update AIPN policy using policy gradients or Q-learning with the composite loss $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} $.  

### **2.3 Experimental Design**  
**Datasets & Environments**:  
- **Sparse-Reward Domains**: Modified Mujoco tasks (e.g., Ant-v3 with delayed rewards), DeepMind Control Suite with reward sparsification.  
- **Combinatorial Exploration**: Maze tasks (e.g., MiniGrid) requiring long-term planning.  
- **High-Dimensional Input**: Atari games with grayscale observations (e.g., Montezuma’s Revenge).  

**Baselines**:  
- **Model-Free RL**: SAC, DQN, A3C.  
- **Model-Based RL**: PETS, Dreamer.  
- **Self-Supervised RL**: SPR, DROID.  
- **Neuro-Inspired Baselines**: SPEQ (for UTD efficiency), APCN.  

**Implementation Details**:  
- **HPCN Architecture**: Five-layer network with GRUs for temporal dynamics and ResNet-18 for encoding.  
- **Training Protocol**: 100,000 environment steps with batch size 256. Use Adam optimizer (lr=3e-4) for HPCN, PPO for AIPN.  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
1. **Sample Efficiency**: Episodes to reach 90% of the maximum reward.  
2. **Final Performance**: Average reward over the last 100 episodes.  
3. **Exploration Metrics**: State visitation entropy $ H(s) $, coverage of state-action space.  
4. **Computational Efficiency**: FLOPs per training step.  

### **2.4 Ablation Studies**  
1. **Layer Weighting**: Test $ \lambda^{(l)} $ configurations to study the role of high vs. low-level prediction errors.  
2. **Trade-off Parameter**: Sweep $ \alpha, \beta $ to analyze exploration-exploitation dynamics.  
3. **Hierarchical Depth**: Compare 3, 5, and 7-layer HPCNs.
