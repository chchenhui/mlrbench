### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in tasks ranging from game playing to robotic control. However, most state-of-the-art RL algorithms require millions of interactions with the environment to learn effective policies, making them impractical in real-world scenarios where data acquisition is costly or time-sensitive. In contrast, biological systems learn efficiently, leveraging mechanisms like predictive coding and active inference to minimize uncertainty and adapt rapidly. Predictive coding posits that the brain continuously predicts sensory inputs and adjusts its models based on prediction errors, while active inference extends this by selecting actions to resolve uncertainty and fulfill goals. Integrating these principles into RL could address critical challenges in sample efficiency and exploration.  

**Research Objectives**  
This project aims to:  
1. Develop a neuro-inspired RL framework combining **hierarchical predictive coding** and **active inference** to learn world models with minimal environmental interactions.  
2. Design a policy optimization mechanism that minimizes *expected free energy* to balance exploration and exploitation intrinsically.  
3. Validate the framework’s sample efficiency and generalization on sparse-reward and partially observable tasks.  

**Significance**  
This work bridges computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering two key contributions:  
- **Scientific**: A deeper understanding of how biological principles like predictive coding can enhance machine learning.  
- **Technical**: A practical RL algorithm that reduces sample complexity, enabling deployment in data-constrained applications (e.g., robotics, healthcare).

### 3. **Methodology**  
#### **3.1 Hierarchical Predictive Coding for World Modeling**  
**Architecture**: The agent learns a hierarchical world model structured as a tree of *predictive coding units* (PCUs), where higher layers predict lower-layer states. Each PCU minimizes prediction errors via gradient-based updates (Friston, 2005). The model’s dynamics are governed by:  
$$
\mathbf{s}_t^{(l)} = f^{(l)}\left(\mathbf{s}_{t-1}^{(l)}, \mathbf{a}_{t-1}; \theta^{(l)}\right) + \epsilon^{(l)},
$$  
where $l$ denotes the layer, $\mathbf{s}_t^{(l)}$ is the latent state, $f^{(l)}$ a neural network, $\theta^{(l)}$ parameters, and $\epsilon^{(l)}$ prediction errors.  

**Learning Objective**: The agent minimizes weighted free energy across layers:  
$$
\mathcal{F} = \sum_{l=1}^L \mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{s}^{(l)})}\left[ \underbrace{-\log p(\mathbf{s}^{(l)} \mid \mathbf{s}^{(l+1)})}_{\text{Accuracy}} + \underbrace{\text{KL}\left[q(\mathbf{s}^{(l)}) \| p(\mathbf{s}^{(l)})\right]}_{\text{Complexity}} \right],
$$  
where $p(\mathbf{s}^{(l)})$ is a prior (e.g., Gaussian), and $q(\mathbf{s}^{(l)})$ the posterior.  

#### **3.2 Action Selection via Expected Free Energy Minimization**  
Actions are chosen to minimize *expected free energy* (EFE), balancing reward maximization and uncertainty reduction:  
$$
\mathcal{G}(\mathbf{a}_t) = \mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{s}_{t+1} \mid \mathbf{a}_t)}\left[ \underbrace{-\log p(\mathbf{r}_{t+1} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t+1})}_{\text{Reward seeking}} + \underbrace{\text{KL}\left[q(\mathbf{s}_{t+1}) \| q(\mathbf{s}_{t+1} \mid \mathbf{a}_t)\right]}_{\text{Uncertainty reduction}} \right].
$$  
A meta-policy $\pi_{\text{meta}}$ samples actions from:  
$$
\mathbf{a}_t \sim \pi_{\text{meta}}(\mathbf{a}_t \mid \arg\min_{\mathbf{a}} \mathcal{G}(\mathbf{a})).
$$  

#### **3.3 Algorithm Design**  
1. **World Model Training**:  
   - Collect trajectories $\mathcal{D} = \{(\mathbf{o}_t, \mathbf{a}_t, \mathbf{r}_t)\}$ using exploratory policies.  
   - Train hierarchical PCUs by minimizing $\mathcal{F}$ using variational inference.  

2. **Policy Optimization**:  
   - Roll out candidate actions, compute EFE for each, and update $\pi_{\text{meta}}$ via policy gradient to favor low-EFE actions.  

3. **Stabilization Phase** (Inspired by SPEQ):  
   - Periodically freeze data collection to refine Q-functions and world models using offline data, reducing computational overhead.  

#### **3.4 Experimental Design**  
**Environments**:  
- **Sparse-Reward Tasks**: Montezuma’s Revenge (Atari), MuJoCo AntMaze.  
- **Compositional Generalization**: Meta-World ML45 benchmark.  
- **Biological Plausibility Tests**: Digit-based part-whole hierarchy tasks (Omniglot).  

**Baselines**: Compare against DreamerV3 (model-based RL), PPO (model-free RL), and SPEQ (efficiency-focused).  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
1. **Sample Efficiency**: Steps to reach 80% of expert performance.  
2. **Asymptotic Performance**: Average reward over 1M steps.  
3. **Exploration Efficacy**: State coverage entropy $H(\mathcal{S}) = -\sum_s p(s) \log p(s)$.  
4. **Computational Cost**: Training time and GPU memory usage.  

**Ablation Studies**:  
- Remove hierarchical structure.  
- Replace EFE with pure reward maximization.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Outcomes**:  
1. A novel RL framework that reduces sample complexity by 30–50% over DreamerV3 and PPO on sparse-reward tasks.  
2. Hierarchical predictive coding models that generalize across tasks via shared latent representations.

**Impact**:  
- **Neuroscience**: Validates predictive coding as a viable model of biological learning, informing future brain-inspired algorithms.  
- **AI Applications**: Enables RL in domains with limited data (e.g., medical robotics, autonomous vehicles).  
- **Sustainability**: Reduces computational costs, aligning with green AI initiatives.
