**Title:** NeuroPredictive Networks: Bridging Predictive Coding and Self-Supervised Learning for Efficient AI  

**Motivation:** Modern AI systems rely heavily on labeled data, which is costly and time-consuming to curate. In contrast, biological intelligence thrives in unstructured environments using self-supervised mechanisms like predictive coding, where the brain minimizes prediction errors to learn efficient representations. Developing AI models that emulate this neurobiological principle could reduce dependency on labeled data, enhance adaptability, and enable real-time learning in dynamic scenarios such as autonomous navigation or robotics.  

**Main Idea:** We propose *NeuroPredictive Networks*, a novel architecture integrating predictive coding and active inference with transformer-based attention mechanisms. The model will use hierarchical layers to generate top-down predictions and refine them via bottom-up sensory input, mimicking cortical processing. Attention modules will dynamically prioritize salient features, while Hebbian plasticity rules will update synaptic weights based on prediction errors. The system will be trained on unstructured video datasets to learn spatiotemporal representations without labels, evaluated on tasks like action recognition and anomaly detection. We expect it to outperform existing self-supervised methods in accuracy and data efficiency, particularly in low-resource settings. This work could bridge the gap between neuroscience and AI, enabling energy-efficient, adaptive systems for real-world deployment while offering insights into biological prediction-error mechanisms.
