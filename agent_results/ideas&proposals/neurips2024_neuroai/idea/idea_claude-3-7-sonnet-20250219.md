# Neural Predictive Coding for Efficient Multi-sensory Integration

## Motivation
Current AI systems excel in single-modality tasks but struggle with efficient multi-sensory integration, a core capability of biological neural systems. The brain's remarkable ability to combine information across sensory modalities while maintaining energy efficiency remains unmatched by artificial systems. This research addresses the computational inefficiency and lack of robust cross-modal processing in current AI by drawing inspiration from the brain's predictive coding mechanisms, which allow it to integrate multiple sensory streams while optimizing for energy consumption and prediction accuracy.

## Main Idea
This research proposes a novel neural network architecture that implements hierarchical predictive coding across multiple sensory modalities (vision, audio, tactile). Unlike conventional multi-modal models that process each modality independently before late fusion, our system maintains continuous predictive relationships between modalities at multiple levels of processing. The architecture incorporates two key neurobiological principles: (1) bidirectional prediction pathways that generate expectations across modalities, and (2) precision-weighted prediction error signals that dynamically modulate the influence of each modality based on reliability. By continuously predicting cross-modal relationships, the system can operate with significantly reduced computational requirements when sensory inputs match predictions, only allocating additional resources when prediction errors occur. We expect this approach to yield 30-40% computational efficiency improvements while enhancing robustness to noisy or missing sensory information.
