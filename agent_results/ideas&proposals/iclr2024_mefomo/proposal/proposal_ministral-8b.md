# Probing Pre-training Data Influence on Emergent Abilities via Representation Perturbation

## 1. Introduction

Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized machine learning research across various domains, demonstrating extraordinary performance and surprising emergent capabilities. These models are trained on extensive, highly varied datasets and can be quickly adapted to solve numerous tasks. However, the understanding of FMs lags significantly behind their performance, with significant gaps in the characterization of emergent phenomena and the impact of specific data subsets on these abilities.

This research aims to investigate the influence of pre-training data subsets on emergent abilities by analyzing their impact on learned representations. Specifically, we hypothesize that critical data significantly shapes specific regions of the representation space crucial for emergent tasks. By selectively perturbing or ablating representation components strongly associated with these clusters in a pre-trained FM, we can quantify the influence of different data types on specific emergent abilities. This approach will provide insights into data curation for capability development and potentially mitigate undesirable behaviors.

### 1.1 Background

Foundation models have shown remarkable performance in various domains, including language (e.g., GPT-3, BERT), vision (e.g., SimCLR), speech (e.g., Whisper), and multi-modal (e.g., CLIP, DALL-E) inputs. However, understanding the underlying mechanisms that enable these models to exhibit emergent capabilities remains a significant challenge. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of pre-training data in shaping the representations learned by FMs, but a rigorous characterization of how specific data subsets contribute to these abilities is still lacking.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. To identify critical data subsets that significantly influence the development of emergent abilities in foundation models.
2. To develop techniques for selectively perturbing or ablating representation components associated with these data subsets.
3. To quantify the impact of these perturbations on specific emergent abilities.
4. To provide practical guidelines for data curation to cultivate desired skills or mitigate undesirable ones without extensive re-training.

### 1.3 Significance

Understanding the influence of pre-training data on emergent abilities is crucial for several reasons:
- **Efficient Training**: Identifying critical data subsets can help in optimizing the training process by focusing on the most influential data.
- **Capability Development**: By understanding how specific data shapes representations, we can curate data to cultivate desired skills or mitigate undesirable behaviors.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Characterizing the impact of data subsets can help in mitigating biases and ensuring that models are aligned with human preferences.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing

We will start by collecting a diverse dataset encompassing various data types, such as code, mathematical texts, dialogues, and more. This dataset will be preprocessed to ensure consistency and quality, including tokenization, normalization, and removal of duplicates.

### 2.2 Pre-training

The collected dataset will be used to pre-train a foundation model. We will employ a state-of-the-art architecture, such as the Transformer, and train the model using a combination of contrastive and masked language modeling objectives. The pre-training process will be conducted on a large-scale dataset to ensure that the model learns comprehensive representations.

### 2.3 Data Clustering

To identify critical data subsets, we will employ clustering techniques to group similar data points based on their content and context. We will use algorithms such as K-means or hierarchical clustering to group data into clusters, each representing a specific data type or topic.

### 2.4 Representation Perturbation

We will develop techniques inspired by representation engineering and causal mediation analysis to selectively perturb or ablate representation components associated with the identified data clusters. This will involve:
- **Representation Extraction**: Extracting the learned representations from the pre-trained model.
- **Component Identification**: Identifying representation components strongly associated with the data clusters.
- **Perturbation**: Perturbing or ablating these components to understand their impact on downstream tasks.

### 2.5 Downstream Evaluation

To quantify the impact of perturbations, we will evaluate the performance of the perturbed model on specific emergent abilities. We will use benchmark datasets such as GSM8K and BIG-Bench, which assess reasoning and complex problem-solving capabilities. The evaluation metrics will include accuracy, F1 score, and other relevant performance indicators.

### 2.6 Statistical Analysis

To ensure the robustness of our findings, we will employ statistical analysis techniques to interpret the results of the perturbations. This will involve:
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Conducting hypothesis tests to determine the significance of the observed changes in performance.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Calculating confidence intervals to estimate the range within which the true effect size is likely to fall.

### 2.7 Experimental Design

To validate the method, we will conduct a series of experiments with varying levels of perturbation. We will also compare the performance of the perturbed model with a baseline model that has not undergone any perturbations. The experimental design will include:
- **Control Group**: A pre-trained model that serves as the baseline for comparison.
- **Treated Groups**: Models with different levels of perturbation applied to the representation components.
- **Randomization**: Randomly selecting data clusters for perturbation to ensure the generalizability of the results.
- **Replication**: Conducting multiple experiments with different random seeds to ensure the reproducibility of the findings.

### 2.8 Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation metrics will include:
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, F1 score, and other relevant performance indicators for the downstream tasks.
- **Statistical Metrics**: P-values, confidence intervals, and effect sizes to quantify the significance of the results.
