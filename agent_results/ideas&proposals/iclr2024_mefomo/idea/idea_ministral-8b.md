**Title: "Efficient and Bias-Aware Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models"**

**Motivation:** While foundation models (FMs) have shown remarkable performance, understanding and mitigating their biases and ensuring their efficient adaptation to downstream tasks remain critical challenges. This research aims to address these issues by developing bias-aware fine-tuning methods and exploring the efficiency of fine-tuning for FMs.

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a novel fine-tuning framework that incorporates bias-aware learning objectives and efficient adaptation strategies. The framework will consist of three main components:

1. **Bias-Aware Fine-Tuning:** We will develop a loss function that explicitly penalizes biased outputs during fine-tuning. This will involve identifying and mitigating biases in the pre-training data and ensuring that the fine-tuned model aligns with desired fairness criteria.

2. **Efficient Fine-Tuning:** To address the computational efficiency of fine-tuning, we will explore task-aware pruning and distillation methods. These techniques aim to retain the performance of large models while reducing the model size and computational requirements.

3. **Scaling Analysis:** We will investigate how the scale of the model impacts the efficiency of fine-tuning and the effectiveness of bias mitigation. This analysis will help identify optimal model sizes and training strategies for different downstream tasks.

The expected outcomes include a set of bias-aware fine-tuning methods, efficient adaptation strategies, and a better understanding of the relationship between model scale and fine-tuning efficiency. This research has the potential to significantly improve the practicality and safety of foundation models in real-world applications.
