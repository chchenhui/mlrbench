# Geometric Message Passing for Dynamic Graph Learning

## Introduction

### Background

Dynamic graphs pose significant challenges for machine learning due to their evolving nature, where both node attributes and graph topology change over time. Traditional machine learning approaches often struggle to capture the underlying geometric structures that govern these dynamics, leading to poor generalization and an inability to model complex temporal dependencies. This limitation hinders applications in crucial domains such as traffic forecasting, epidemic modeling, and recommendation systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages differential geometry and Riemannian manifold theory to enhance dynamic graph learning.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. To develop a specialized message passing neural network that operates on the tangent spaces of Riemannian manifolds, enabling communication between time steps while respecting underlying geometric constraints.
2. To introduce parallel transport operators that maintain geometric consistency when propagating information across time.
3. To design geodesic attention mechanisms that capture long-range dependencies by measuring distances along manifold curves rather than in Euclidean space.
4. To implement curvature-aware aggregation functions that adapt to the local geometry of the graph.
5. To validate the proposed method through comprehensive experiments on traffic forecasting and physical simulation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and interpretability.

### Significance

The proposed framework aims to address the key challenges in dynamic graph learning, including capturing complex temporal dependencies, scalability, geometric structure incorporation, robustness to missing data, and interpretability. By leveraging differential geometry and Riemannian manifold theory, our approach offers a novel perspective on dynamic graph learning, potentially leading to significant advancements in various applications.

## Methodology

### Research Design

#### Data Collection

We will collect dynamic graph datasets from various domains, such as traffic networks, social interactions, and physical simulations. These datasets will include graph snapshots at different time steps, along with corresponding node attributes and edge information.

#### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Manifold Representation**:
   - Represent dynamic graphs as trajectories on Riemannian manifolds, where each time step corresponds to a point on a geometric space.
   - Define the manifold structure based on the graph's intrinsic geometry, such as the graph Laplacian or the geodesic distance.

2. **Parallel Transport Operators**:
   - Develop parallel transport operators that maintain geometric consistency when propagating information across time steps. These operators will use the manifold's connection to map vectors from one point to another, preserving the geometric properties.
   - Mathematically, if \( P_t \) represents the parallel transport operator at time \( t \), then:
     $$
     P_{t}(v) = \exp_{t} \circ \nabla_{t} \circ \exp_{t}^{-1}(v)
     $$
     where \( \exp_{t} \) and \( \exp_{t}^{-1} \) are the exponential and inverse exponential maps, and \( \nabla_{t} \) is the covariant derivative.

3. **Geodesic Attention Mechanisms**:
   - Implement geodesic attention mechanisms that capture long-range dependencies by measuring distances along manifold curves rather than in Euclidean space.
   - Define the attention weights as a function of the geodesic distance between nodes:
     $$
     \text{Attention}(u, v) = \exp\left(-\frac{d_{\text{geo}}(u, v)}{\tau}\right)
     $$
     where \( d_{\text{geo}}(u, v) \) is the geodesic distance between nodes \( u \) and \( v \), and \( \tau \) is a temperature parameter.

4. **Curvature-Aware Aggregation Functions**:
   - Design curvature-aware aggregation functions that adapt to the local geometry of the graph. These functions will consider the curvature of the manifold to adjust the aggregation process.
   - Mathematically, the aggregation function \( A \) can be defined as:
     $$
     A(u) = \sum_{v \in N(u)} \text{Attention}(u, v) \cdot w_{uv} \cdot f(v)
     $$
     where \( N(u) \) is the neighborhood of node \( u \), \( w_{uv} \) is the edge weight, and \( f(v) \) is the feature of node \( v \).

5. **Message Passing Neural Network**:
   - Develop a message passing neural network that incorporates the parallel transport operators, geodesic attention mechanisms, and curvature-aware aggregation functions.
   - The network will propagate information through the graph, updating node embeddings at each time step while respecting the geometric constraints.

#### Experimental Design

To validate the proposed method, we will conduct experiments on two datasets: traffic network forecasting and physical simulation tasks. The evaluation metrics will include:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: To measure the prediction accuracy of the model.
- **R-squared Score (R²)**: To assess the goodness of fit of the model.
- **Interpretability Metrics**: To evaluate the interpretability of the model, such as the geometric consistency of the node embeddings and the ability to capture long-range dependencies.
