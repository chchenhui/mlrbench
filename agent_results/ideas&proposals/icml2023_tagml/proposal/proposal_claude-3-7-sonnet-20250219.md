# Geometric Manifold Message Passing Networks for Dynamic Graph Learning

## 1. Introduction

### Background
Dynamic graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications, from traffic networks and social media interactions to molecular dynamics and financial systems. These graphs evolve over time through changes in both node attributes and connectivity patterns, presenting significant challenges for traditional machine learning approaches. Unlike static graphs, dynamic graphs require methods that can capture the complex temporal dependencies and underlying geometric structures that govern their evolution.

Current approaches to dynamic graph learning have advanced considerably but still face fundamental limitations. Methods like EvolveGCN (Pareja et al., 2019), ROLAND (You et al., 2022), and Temporal Graph Networks (Rossi et al., 2020) have made significant progress in adapting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to temporal settings. However, these approaches typically treat time steps as discrete events and fail to capture the continuous nature of graph evolution. Furthermore, they often rely on Euclidean representations that cannot adequately model the non-Euclidean geometric structures inherent in many real-world graphs.

The integration of differential geometry and Riemannian manifold theory into dynamic graph learning offers a promising direction to address these limitations. By representing dynamic graphs as trajectories on manifolds, we can better capture the geometric constraints that govern their evolution. This perspective aligns with recent advances in geometric deep learning (Bronstein et al., 2017) and continuous-time models like Neural Controlled Differential Equations (Qin et al., 2023), but has not been fully explored in the context of dynamic graphs.

### Research Objectives
This research proposes a novel framework called Geometric Manifold Message Passing Networks (GM-MPN) that leverages principles from differential geometry to enhance dynamic graph learning. Specifically, our objectives are to:

1. Develop a geometric representation for dynamic graphs as trajectories on Riemannian manifolds, capturing both the structural and temporal aspects of graph evolution.

2. Design message passing mechanisms that respect the underlying manifold structure, enabling information to propagate across both spatial and temporal dimensions while preserving geometric consistency.

3. Introduce curvature-aware operators that adapt to the local geometry of the graph, enhancing the model's ability to capture complex patterns in dynamic settings.

4. Create interpretable learning algorithms that provide insights into the geometric nature of temporal graph evolution, improving model transparency and trustworthiness.

### Significance
The significance of this research lies in its potential to substantially advance the field of dynamic graph learning through geometric principles. By incorporating Riemannian geometry, we can develop models that more accurately reflect the intrinsic structure of real-world dynamic networks. This approach offers several key advantages:

1. **Enhanced Representation Power**: Geometric manifolds provide a natural framework for representing complex, non-Euclidean structures that evolve over time, potentially leading to more accurate predictions in tasks like traffic forecasting and epidemic modeling.

2. **Improved Generalization**: By respecting the geometric constraints of dynamic graphs, our approach can generalize better to unseen data, particularly in scenarios with limited training examples.

3. **Interpretable Insights**: The geometric perspective offers novel ways to interpret and visualize dynamic graph evolution, providing valuable insights for domains like social network analysis and transportation planning.

4. **Theoretical Guarantees**: The mathematical foundation of differential geometry provides a formal basis for analyzing the properties and limitations of dynamic graph learning models.

This research bridges the gap between the rich theory of differential geometry and the practical challenges of dynamic graph learning, contributing to the advancement of both fields and opening new possibilities for applications in various domains.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Geometric Representation of Dynamic Graphs

We formalize a dynamic graph as a sequence of graph snapshots $G = \{G_1, G_2, ..., G_T\}$, where each snapshot $G_t = (V_t, E_t, X_t)$ consists of nodes $V_t$, edges $E_t$, and node features $X_t$ at time step $t$. Instead of treating each snapshot as a point in Euclidean space, we represent the entire dynamic graph as a trajectory on a Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{M}$.

Each graph snapshot $G_t$ corresponds to a point on the manifold, with the temporal evolution of the graph represented by a curve $\gamma: [0, T] \rightarrow \mathcal{M}$. The tangent space $T_{G_t}\mathcal{M}$ at each point captures the possible directions of change for the graph at time $t$. This geometric perspective allows us to model the continuous nature of graph evolution while respecting the underlying non-Euclidean structure.

The Riemannian metric tensor $g$ defines how distances and angles are measured on the manifold, with its components at point $G_t$ denoted as $g_{ij}(G_t)$. We propose to learn this metric tensor from data, allowing the model to adapt to the specific geometry of the graph domain.

We define the distance between two graph snapshots $G_t$ and $G_{t'}$ as the length of the geodesic (shortest path) connecting them on the manifold:

$$d(G_t, G_{t'}) = \int_{t}^{t'} \sqrt{g_{\gamma(s)}(\dot{\gamma}(s), \dot{\gamma}(s))} ds$$

where $\dot{\gamma}(s)$ denotes the velocity vector of the curve at time $s$.

### 2.2 Manifold Message Passing Mechanisms

Building on the geometric representation, we develop a message passing framework that operates on the manifold structure. For each node $v$ in the graph, we compute its representation $h_v^{(t)}$ at time $t$ through the following steps:

1. **Spatial Message Passing**: Information is propagated among neighboring nodes within the same time step, respecting the manifold structure:

$$m_v^{(t)} = \text{AGGREGATE}\left(\left\{\phi\left(h_v^{(t-1)}, h_u^{(t-1)}, e_{uv}^{(t)}\right) | u \in \mathcal{N}_v^{(t)}\right\}\right)$$

where $\mathcal{N}_v^{(t)}$ is the set of neighbors of node $v$ at time $t$, $\phi$ is a message function, and $e_{uv}^{(t)}$ represents edge features.

2. **Temporal Message Passing**: Information is propagated across time steps using parallel transport operators that preserve geometric consistency:

$$h_v^{(t)} = \text{UPDATE}\left(h_v^{(t-1)}, m_v^{(t)}, \Gamma_{v,t-1}^{t}(h_v^{(t-1)})\right)$$

where $\Gamma_{v,t-1}^{t}$ is the parallel transport operator that maps vectors from the tangent space at $G_{t-1}$ to the tangent space at $G_t$.

The parallel transport operator is defined as:

$$\Gamma_{v,t-1}^{t}(h_v^{(t-1)}) = h_v^{(t-1)} - \sum_{i,j,k} \Gamma^i_{jk} h_v^{(t-1),j} \dot{\gamma}^k \Delta t$$

where $\Gamma^i_{jk}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the Riemannian connection, $h_v^{(t-1),j}$ is the $j$-th component of the vector $h_v^{(t-1)}$, and $\dot{\gamma}^k$ is the $k$-th component of the velocity vector.

### 2.3 Geodesic Attention Mechanism

To capture long-range dependencies in dynamic graphs, we introduce a geodesic attention mechanism that measures relevance between nodes based on their distance along manifold curves rather than in Euclidean space:

$$\alpha_{v,u}^{(t,t')} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{d_g(h_v^{(t)}, h_u^{(t')})^2}{\sigma^2}\right)}{\sum_{w,s} \exp\left(-\frac{d_g(h_v^{(t)}, h_w^{(s)})^2}{\sigma^2}\right)}$$

where $d_g(h_v^{(t)}, h_u^{(t')})$ is the geodesic distance between the representations of nodes $v$ and $u$ at times $t$ and $t'$, respectively, and $\sigma$ is a learned temperature parameter.

The geodesic distance is computed using the exponential and logarithmic maps on the manifold:

$$d_g(h_v^{(t)}, h_u^{(t')}) = \|\log_{h_v^{(t)}}(h_u^{(t')})\|_{h_v^{(t)}}$$

where $\log_{h_v^{(t)}}$ is the logarithmic map at point $h_v^{(t)}$, which maps a point on the manifold to a vector in the tangent space.

### 2.4 Curvature-Aware Aggregation

We propose a curvature-aware aggregation function that adapts to the local geometry of the graph:

$$\text{AGGREGATE}_{\text{curv}}(\{x_i\}_{i \in \mathcal{S}}) = \text{MLP}\left(\frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}|} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} x_i \odot (1 + \lambda R(G_t, v_i))\right)$$

where $R(G_t, v_i)$ is the scalar curvature at node $v_i$ in graph $G_t$, $\lambda$ is a learnable parameter controlling the influence of curvature, and $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication.

The scalar curvature is approximated using the heat kernel signature (HKS) of the graph Laplacian:

$$R(G_t, v_i) \approx -\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \log(K_t(v_i, v_i))|_{t=0}$$

where $K_t(v_i, v_i)$ is the heat kernel diagonal element for node $v_i$.

### 2.5 Training Procedure

The GM-MPN is trained end-to-end using a combination of supervised and unsupervised objectives:

1. **Task-specific Loss**: For tasks like node classification or link prediction, we use standard supervised loss functions (e.g., cross-entropy, binary cross-entropy) based on the ground truth labels.

2. **Geometric Consistency Loss**: To enforce consistency in the geometric representation, we introduce a loss term that encourages the model to preserve geodesic distances:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{geo}} = \frac{1}{|P|} \sum_{(i,j,k,l) \in P} |d_g(h_i^{(t_i)}, h_j^{(t_j)}) - d_g(h_k^{(t_k)}, h_l^{(t_l)})|$$

where $P$ is a set of quadruplets selected based on structural and temporal similarities.

3. **Manifold Regularization**: To encourage representations to lie on the manifold, we add a regularization term:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}} = \frac{1}{N \times T} \sum_{v=1}^{N} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \|h_v^{(t)} - \text{proj}_{\mathcal{M}}(h_v^{(t)})\|^2$$

where $\text{proj}_{\mathcal{M}}$ is the projection onto the manifold.

The overall training objective is:

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{geo}} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}$$

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are hyperparameters controlling the influence of each loss component.

### 2.6 Experimental Design

For each task, we will conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component of our framework:

- GM-MPN with Euclidean instead of Riemannian geometry

We will also analyze the interpretability of our model by visualizing:
- The learned manifold structure for different types of dynamic graphs
- The attention weights of the geodesic attention mechanism
- The computed curvature values and their correlation with network properties

For statistical significance, each experiment will be repeated with 5 different random seeds, reporting mean performance and standard deviation.
