# Geometric Message Passing Networks: Learning on Dynamic Graphs via Riemannian Manifold Trajectories  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Dynamic graphs, characterized by evolving node attributes and topological relationships over time, are fundamental to modeling complex systems such as traffic networks, social interactions, and biochemical pathways. Traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) designed for static graphs struggle to capture the intricate temporal dependencies and non-Euclidean structures inherent in these datasets. Recent advances in geometric machine learning have demonstrated the power of algebraic and topological frameworks to preserve invariances in static graphs, but dynamic settings remain underserved in terms of rigorous geometric modeling. Current approaches like EvolveGCN, GN-CDE, and TGNs often treat time as a sequential perturbation rather than intrinsic geometric structure, leading to suboptimal generalization and interpretability.  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal seeks to address three key challenges:  
1. **Geometric Temporal Modeling**: Embed dynamic graphs into Riemannian manifolds to explicitly encode temporal evolution as smooth trajectories constrained by curvature and topology.  
2. **Consistent Information Propagation**: Develop message-passing mechanisms on tangent spaces that respect parallel transport and geodesic continuity across time steps.  
3. **Curvature-Driven Adaptation**: Introduce curvature-aware aggregation to dynamically adjust information mixing based on local geometric properties (e.g., Ricci curvature).  

### Significance  
By bridging differential geometry and dynamic graph learning, this work will:  
- Enable **explainable AI** for temporal networks by linking performance gains to interpretable geometric invariants (e.g., sectional curvature influencing robustness).  
- Improve **traffic forecasting**, **epidemic modeling**, and **recommender systems** through principled modeling of non-Euclidean temporal dynamics.  
- Advance mathematical machine learning by formalizing Riemannian frameworks for graph-structured data.  

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
We will evaluate our framework on three dynamic graph datasets with diverse temporal characteristics:  
1. **Urban Traffic Network (PeMS)**: 11,160 nodes (sensor stations) with time-aggregated speed/occupancy measurements.  
2. **DBLP Citation Graph**: 250,000 nodes (authors) with co-occurrence edges evolving over 30 years.  
3. **Twitter Interaction Network**: 15,000 active users with retweet/comment edges tracked daily.  

For each dataset, we construct time-varying adjacency matrices $ \mathcal{A}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{N_t \times N_t} $ and feature tensors $ \mathcal{X}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{N_t \times d} $, where $ N_t $ is the number of nodes and $ d $ is the feature dimension at time $ t $.  

### 2.2 Geometric Representation of Dynamic Graphs  
**Manifold Trajectory Construction**:  
Let $ \mathcal{G}(t) = (\mathcal{V}(t), \mathcal{E}(t)) $ represent a graph at time $ t $. We define a smooth trajectory $ \gamma: [0, T] \rightarrow \mathcal{M} $ on a Riemannian manifold $ \mathcal{M} $, where each point $ \gamma(t) $ corresponds to a geometric representation of $ \mathcal{G}(t) $. We use graph embeddings via spectral manifolds, where the Laplacian matrix $ L(t) $ is mapped to the space of symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices with Riemannian metric $ g_{\text{SPD}}(X, Y) = \text{Tr}(X^{-1}Y) $.  

**Tangent Space Projection**:  
At each $ \gamma(t) $, we project node features $ \mathcal{X}(t) $ to the tangent space $ T_{\gamma(t)}\mathcal{M} $ via the exponential map $ \exp_{\gamma(t)}^{-1} $. This ensures linear approximations respect the curvature of $ \mathcal{M} $.  

### 2.3 Geometric Message Passing Framework  

#### Parallel Transport-Aware Aggregation  
To maintain geometric consistency across time, we transport messages between tangent spaces. Given a curve $ \gamma $ connecting $ \gamma(t) $ and $ \gamma(t') $, the parallel transport operator $ \mathcal{T}_{t \rightarrow t'}: T_{\gamma(t)}\mathcal{M} \rightarrow T_{\gamma(t')}\mathcal{M} $ transports a vector $ v \in T_{\gamma(t)}\mathcal{M} $ along $ \gamma $ by solving the covariant derivative equation:  
$$
\nabla_{\dot{\gamma}(t)} X(t) = 0 \quad \text{(Levi-Civita connection)},
$$  
where $ \nabla $ is the connection induced by $ \mathcal{M} $'s metric. This ensures that message vectors retain their geometric meaning when propagated across time.  

#### Geodesic Self-Attention Mechanism  
We define long-range dependencies via geodesic distances $ d_\mathcal{M}(u, v) $ between nodes $ u, v $ on the manifold. For node $ i $ at time $ t $, we compute attention weights $ \alpha_{ij}(t) $ as:  
$$
\alpha_{ij}(t) = \text{softmax} \left( \frac{ \left\langle \phi_i(t), \phi_j(t') \right\rangle_{g_{\gamma(t)}} }{ \sqrt{d}} - \lambda \cdot d_\mathcal{M}(\gamma(t), \gamma(t')) \right),
$$  
where $ \phi_{i}(t) \in T_{\gamma(t)}\mathcal{M} $ is the transported embedding, $ \lambda $ balances temporal smoothness, and $ \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_{g} $ denotes the metric-induced inner product.  

#### Curvature-Aware Neighborhood Aggregation  
We adaptively weight neighbors based on local curvature using the Ricci curvature $ \text{Ric}(v, v) $ for direction $ v \in T_{\gamma(t)}\mathcal{M} $. The curvature-aware aggregation becomes:  
$$
\tilde{h}_i(t) = \sigma \left( \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \alpha_{ij}(t) \cdot \left( w_j(t) \cdot e^{-\kappa \cdot \text{Ric}_i(t) } \right) \cdot h_j(t) \right),
$$  
where $ \sigma $ is a nonlinearity, $ \kappa $ modulates curvature sensitivity, and $ w_j(t) $ learns adaptive neighbor contributions.  

### 2.4 Training Procedure and Optimization  
**Loss Functions**:  
- **Traffic Forecasting**: Huber loss $ \mathcal{L} = \sum_{t} \sum_{i} \delta(h_i(t) - y_i(t)) $ to minimize velocity prediction errors.  
- **Node Classification**: Cross-entropy between $ h_i(t) $ and labels $ y_i \in \{1,\ldots,C\} $.  
- **Link Prediction**: Binary cross-entropy for edge reconstruction $ \mathcal{L} = -\sum_{ij}\log p(A_{ij}(t)) $.  

**Curvature Regularization**:  
We regularize the latent manifold's sectional curvature $ K $ via:  
$$
\mathcal{J} = \left| K(\mathcal{M}) - \hat{K}(\mathcal{G}(t)) \right|_F,
$$  
where $ \hat{K} $ estimates discrete curvature from $ \mathcal{G}(t) $ (e.g., via Gromov hyperbolicity).  

**Optimization**:  
We parameterize $ \mathcal{M} $ as a learnable SPD manifold with Cholesky decomposition $ L(t)L(t)^T \approx A(t) $, and use geodesic convolutional networks (GeoTorch) for optimization. The total loss $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L} + \mu\mathcal{J} $ is minimized via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent (RSGD) with parallel transport momentum [1].

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Performance Improvements  
1. **Traffic Prediction**: Reduce RMSE by ≥15% on PeMS compared to TGNs by explicitly modeling acceleration as geodesic flow (Figure 1).  
2. **Epidemic Dynamics**: Achieve 92% AUC-ROC for outbreak detection on DBLP using curvature as an early warning signal (Section 3.3).  
3. **Scalability**: Process 100k-node graphs with $ O(10^3) $ FLOPS/node via tangent space projections, outperforming GN-CDE’s manifold-free interpolation.  

### Theoretical Contributions  
1. **Temporal Stability**: Formalize dynamic GNNs under Gromov-Hausdorff perturbations, proving stability against topological drift $ \delta $:  
$$
\| \Phi(\mathcal{G}) - \Phi(\mathcal{G}') \| \leq C \cdot \delta \cdot \|w\| \cdot (\text{Lip}(\sigma) + \kappa),
$$  
where $ \Phi $ is our readout function and $ \kappa $ is curvature sensitivity [2].  
2. **Curvature-Information Trade-off**: Derive bounds on information propagation in curved spaces:  
$$
\log p(y| \mathcal{G}) \lesssim -\frac{1}{2} K D^2 + \text{dim}(\mathcal{M}) \log D,
$$  
showing high-curvature manifolds limit information retention $ D $ [3].  

### Practical Impact  
- **Interpretable Models**: Visualize curvature hotspots to identify critical nodes in infrastructure networks.  
- **Robust Learning**: Deploy models in medical domains where topological uncertainty arises from sampling bias.  
- **Community Tools**: Open-source geometric deep learning library with SPD manifold layers and parallel transport solvers.
