Title: Topology-Guided Curriculum Learning for Enhanced Model Training

Motivation:  
Deep networks often struggle with datasets exhibiting widely varying structural complexity. Training on high-topological-complexity samples from the outset can slow convergence, reduce robustness, and hamper generalization. By organizing training data according to intrinsic geometric and topological difficulty, we can foster more stable learning and better performance guarantees.

Main Idea:  
We propose to compute a “topological complexity” score for each sample (or mini-batch) via persistent homology on feature clouds (e.g., raw pixels or embedding layers). Samples are then sorted into a curriculum that gradually increases in complexity. During training, the network starts on low-complexity batches—characterized by few persistent homology features—and progressively incorporates higher-complexity ones. We integrate this schedule into standard optimizers (e.g., Adam) by weighting gradient updates according to complexity. Expected outcomes include faster convergence, improved robustness to perturbations, and tighter generalization bounds tied to topological capacity. This approach bridges topology and training methods, providing a plug-and-play scheme adaptable to vision, graph, and text models.
