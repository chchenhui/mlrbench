### Title: "Topological Data Analysis for Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Data"

### Motivation:
High-dimensional data is ubiquitous in modern machine learning applications, but its inherent complexity often hampers the effectiveness of traditional anomaly detection methods. Topological data analysis (TDA) offers a unique perspective by focusing on the shape and structure of data, providing a powerful tool to identify anomalies that may be obscured by high dimensionality. This research aims to leverage TDA to enhance the robustness and interpretability of anomaly detection algorithms.

### Main Idea:
This research proposes the integration of topological data analysis techniques with machine learning to develop a novel anomaly detection framework. The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Apply dimensionality reduction techniques to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional manifold while preserving its topological structure.
2. **Topological Feature Extraction**: Utilize TDA methods such as persistent homology to extract topological features that capture the shape and structure of the data.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Train a machine learning model using the extracted topological features to identify anomalous data points. This model can be based on classical methods like SVM or more advanced models like autoencoders.
4. **Evaluation and Validation**: Assess the performance of the proposed method using standard metrics and validate it on real-world datasets with known anomalies.

Expected outcomes include improved anomaly detection performance, especially in high-dimensional and complex datasets, and enhanced interpretability through topological insights. The potential impact includes broader applications in fields such as fraud detection, medical diagnostics, and network security, where understanding the underlying structure of data is crucial for effective anomaly detection.
