**Title:** Topological Geometric Framework for Interpretable Deep Learning on Manifold-Structured Data  

**Motivation:**  
Modern machine learning often grapples with high-dimensional, nonlinear data (e.g., biological networks, 3D shapes) where traditional Euclidean methods fail to capture intrinsic structures. While geometric deep learning (GDL) leverages manifold and graph-based representations, it often lacks interpretability, hindering trust in critical applications (e.g., healthcare). Simultaneously, topological data analysis (TDA) provides robust summaries of data shape but struggles to integrate with end-to-end learning pipelines. Bridging this gap could enhance both model performance and explainability for complex data.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a hybrid framework that combines TDA with GDL to learn interpretable representations of manifold-structured data. First, persistent homology extracts topological features (e.g., holes, connected components) as structured priors. These features are then integrated into GDL architectures via a co-training paradigm, where a geometric neural network learns task-specific representations while a topological regularizer enforces consistency with the dataâ€™s intrinsic shape. Finally, we design a post-hoc explanation module that maps model decisions to topological features (e.g., linking classification errors to missing holes in persistence diagrams). We evaluate the framework on tasks like protein structure prediction and 3D shape segmentation, measuring performance gains against standard GDL baselines and assessing interpretability through human-in-the-loop experiments. This approach could yield models that are both accurate and transparent, advancing applications in scientific discovery and safety-critical systems.
