**Title:** Topological Explainability via Layer-wise Persistence Homology in Deep Neural Networks  

**Motivation:** As deep learning models grow in complexity, understanding their decision-making processes becomes critical for trust and reliability. Current explainability methods often lack mathematical rigor or fail to capture the high-dimensional, nonlinear structures inherent in data. Leveraging topology can provide a principled framework to map how models transform data, offering deeper insights into their behavior.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a novel methodology to interpret neural networks by analyzing topological changes in data manifolds across layers. Using persistent homology, we compute topological summaries (e.g., Betti numbers, persistence diagrams) of activation spaces at each layer, identifying which topological features (e.g., connected components, holes) are preserved or destroyed during processing. By correlating these features with model predictions, we establish a quantitative link between data topology and model decisions. The framework includes efficient algorithms for approximating persistence homology in high dimensions and visualization tools to map critical topological transitions. Expected outcomes include (1) metrics quantifying topological robustness, (2) identification of layers where key decision boundaries form, and (3) a library for topology-driven model auditing. This approach could advance explainability in domains like healthcare, where understanding feature relevance is vital.
