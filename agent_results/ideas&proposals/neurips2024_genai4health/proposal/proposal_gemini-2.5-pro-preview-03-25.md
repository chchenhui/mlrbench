Okay, here is a detailed research proposal based on the provided task description, research idea, and literature review.

## **1. Title:**

**DyTrust-Health: A Dynamic Benchmarking Framework for Evaluating Trustworthiness and Policy Compliance of Generative AI in Healthcare**

## **2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), encompassing technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-modal systems, holds unprecedented potential to transform healthcare (GenAI for Health Workshop Description). Applications range from accelerating drug discovery and synthesizing realistic patient data for research (Jadon & Kumar, 2023) to improving diagnostic accuracy, assisting in treatment planning, and even enabling novel digital therapies. However, the integration of these powerful tools into sensitive clinical workflows is hampered by significant challenges related to trustworthiness and regulatory adherence.

Current GenAI models, while demonstrating impressive capabilities, can exhibit vulnerabilities such as generating factually incorrect information ("hallucinations"), perpetuating biases present in training data (Ramachandranpillai et al., 2024), lacking robustness against adversarial inputs, and operating as "black boxes" with limited transparency. These issues are particularly critical in healthcare, where errors can have severe consequences for patient safety and outcomes. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of GenAI technology often outpaces the development of standardized evaluation methodologies and regulatory frameworks.

Existing benchmarks for AI in healthcare often suffer from limitations: they may be static, failing to adapt to new model architectures, evolving clinical contexts, or changing regulatory landscapes (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, AI Act). They frequently focus on narrow aspects of performance (e.g., accuracy on common tasks) and may not adequately assess safety in diverse patient populations, rare disease scenarios, or under specific policy constraints (GenAI Idea Motivation). The generation of high-fidelity, fair, and privacy-preserving synthetic data, crucial for robust testing, remains a significant challenge despite advances like Bt-GAN (Ramachandranpillai et al., 2024), discGAN (Fuentes et al., 2023), and HiSGT (Zhou & Barbieri, 2025). Specific challenges include ensuring fairness (Challenge 1), maintaining privacy and compliance (Challenge 2), achieving clinical fidelity (Challenge 3), integrating multi-modal data effectively (Challenge 4), and incorporating real-world clinical validation (Challenge 5) (Literature Review Challenges).

This lack of comprehensive, adaptive, and context-aware evaluation frameworks breeds skepticism among clinicians, regulators, and the public, hindering the responsible adoption of potentially beneficial GenAI technologies in healthcare. There is a pressing need for a dynamic evaluation system that can rigorously assess GenAI models across diverse scenarios, incorporate multi-modal data, align with policy requirements, and integrate expert clinical judgment.

**2.2 Research Objectives**

This research aims to develop and validate **DyTrust-Health**, a novel **Dy**namic benchmarking framework for **Trust**worthiness evaluation of GenAI models specifically tailored for **Health**care applications. The framework will address the limitations of current static benchmarks by incorporating adaptability, context-awareness, multi-modality, policy compliance, and real-world validation.

The specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Modular and Dynamic Framework Architecture:** Design and implement a flexible software architecture capable of defining diverse evaluation scenarios, integrating various GenAI models, managing multi-modal test data (synthetic and real), incorporating different assessment modules (automated metrics, clinician feedback), and generating comprehensive reports.
2.  **Implement Advanced Synthetic Data Generation for Healthcare Scenarios:** Develop and integrate sophisticated synthetic data generators (leveraging GANs and Transformer-based approaches inspired by Ramachandranpillai et al., 2024; Fuentes et al., 2023; Zhou & Barbieri, 2025) capable of producing:
    *   High-fidelity, clinically realistic data across modalities (text EHRs, tabular data, basic imaging descriptors).
    *   Fair data distributions representing diverse demographics and mitigating bias amplification.
    *   Challenging edge cases (e.g., rare diseases, complex comorbidities, atypical presentations).
    *   Policy-compliant datasets (e.g., simulating HIPAA-aligned data structures and access patterns for testing model compliance).
3.  **Integrate Multi-modal Evaluation Capabilities:** Design test protocols and metrics to assess the consistency, reliability, and safety of GenAI models processing and generating information from multiple data types simultaneously (e.g., correlating text summaries with diagnostic image findings).
4.  **Implement a Real-time Clinician Feedback and Validation Loop:** Develop an intuitive interface for healthcare professionals to review GenAI outputs within simulated clinical contexts, provide structured and unstructured feedback on accuracy, relevance, safety, and potential biases, and integrate this feedback quantitatively into the overall trustworthiness assessment.
5.  **Define and Quantify Comprehensive Trustworthiness Metrics:** Establish a suite of metrics covering key dimensions of trustworthiness:
    *   **Accuracy & Clinical Utility:** Performance on specific tasks (e.g., diagnosis, summarization).
    *   **Robustness:** Performance under perturbations, missing data, or adversarial inputs.
    *   **Fairness:** Evaluation of performance disparities across demographic subgroups (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity).
    *   **Explainability:** Metrics quantifying the transparency and interpretability of model outputs/reasoning (e.g., using SHAP, LIME, or assessing fidelity of generated explanations).
    *   **Policy Compliance:** Automated checks and expert assessment of adherence to relevant healthcare regulations and ethical guidelines (e.g., data privacy, consent implications).
6.  **Validate the DyTrust-Health Framework:** Demonstrate the framework's utility and effectiveness through case studies involving representative GenAI models applied to distinct healthcare tasks, comparing its evaluation capabilities against existing static benchmarks and showcasing its adaptability to new scenarios and policies.

**2.3 Significance**

This research directly addresses the critical need for robust and reliable evaluation mechanisms to foster trust in GenAI for healthcare, aligning with the core themes of the "GenAI for Health: Potential, Trust and Policy Compliance" workshop. The development of DyTrust-Health offers several significant contributions:

*   **Support for Regulation and Policy:** DyTrust-Health can serve as a powerful tool for policymakers and regulatory bodies to assess the compliance and safety of GenAI applications, potentially informing the development of standardized testing protocols and future regulations.
*   **Acceleration of Responsible Innovation:** By establishing a standardized yet adaptable benchmark, this research can help bridge the gap between GenAI potential and its safe, ethical, and effective deployment, ultimately accelerating the realization of AI's benefits in healthcare research and patient care.
*   **Advancement of Benchmarking Science:** The project contributes novel methodologies for dynamic, multi-modal, and context-aware benchmarking, particularly relevant for high-stakes AI applications beyond healthcare.

By involving multidisciplinary experts (ML researchers, clinicians, potentially policy consultants) as envisioned by the workshop, DyTrust-Health aims to provide a practical, Vetted solution that addresses stakeholder concerns and promotes responsible innovation.

## **3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Research Design**

This research will employ an iterative, mixed-methods design, combining computational development, synthetic data generation, quantitative evaluation, and qualitative expert feedback. The core methodology involves the design, implementation, and validation of the DyTrust-Health framework through a series of development cycles and case studies. Collaboration with clinical experts and consultation regarding relevant policy frameworks (e.g., HIPAA, AI ethics guidelines) will be integral throughout the process.

**3.2 Data Collection and Generation**

Recognizing the sensitivity of healthcare data, DyTrust-Health will primarily rely on advanced synthetic data generation techniques, supplemented by publicly available, de-identified datasets for initial model testing or seeding synthetic generators.

*   **Baseline Real Data (Limited Use):** Publicly available, de-identified datasets like MIMIC-IV (for EHR data), PhysioNet challenge datasets, or public imaging archives (e.g., ChestX-ray14) may be used cautiously for initial validation of synthetic data fidelity or for testing specific model capabilities where appropriate synthetic alternatives are insufficient. All use will adhere strictly to data use agreements and ethical guidelines.
*   **Synthetic Data Generation:** This is a cornerstone of the framework. We will implement and enhance state-of-the-art generative models:
    *   **Techniques:** We will build upon GANs (inspired by Bt-GAN for fairness, discGAN for distribution matching) and Transformer-based models (inspired by HiSGT for clinical fidelity and hierarchy). Techniques like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) may also be explored (Jadon & Kumar, 2023).
    *   **Fairness and Bias Mitigation:** Incorporate techniques like constrained optimization during training, re-weighting schemes for underrepresented groups (Ramachandranpillai et al., 2024), and post-hoc bias correction on generated data. Fairness will be assessed using metrics like demographic parity and equalized odds across sensitive attributes (e.g., ethnicity, sex) present in the seed data or defined in the scenario.
    *   **Edge Case Generation:** Develop methods to intentionally generate challenging scenarios, such as simulating rare diseases by manipulating latent space representations in GANs/VAEs, combining profiles to create complex comorbidities, or generating data points near decision boundaries. Adversarial generation techniques may be adapted to create difficult-to-classify or misleading synthetic cases.
    *   **Policy Compliance Simulation:** Generate synthetic datasets that structurally mimic policy requirements (e.g., data minimization principles, specific consent flags). Test scenarios will be designed where the GenAI model must operate under simulated policy constraints (e.g., accessing only permissible data fields based on a synthetic patient's consent status).
    *   **Multi-modal Synthesis:** Explore techniques for conditionally generating linked multi-modal data (e.g., generating a realistic radiology report text conditioned on synthetic image features, or vice-versa). Ensuring cross-modal consistency will be key.

**3.3 Framework Architecture and Algorithmic Steps**

DyTrust-Health will be designed as a modular framework comprising several interconnected components:

1.  **Scenario Definition Module:** Allows users (researchers, developers, clinicians) to define evaluation contexts by specifying:
    *   Clinical task (e.g., diagnosis, summarization, treatment suggestion).
    *   Target patient population characteristics (demographics, conditions).
    *   Required data modalities (text, tabular, imaging features).
    *   Policy constraints (e.g., HIPAA rules, specific ethical guidelines).
    *   Specific challenges to test (e.g., rare disease focus, robustness checks).
2.  **Synthetic Data Generator:** Selects or generates synthetic datasets matching the defined scenario using the techniques described in 3.2.
3.  **GenAI Model Interface:** An adaptable interface to load and run inferences from various GenAI models (e.g., via API calls or local execution).
4.  **Multi-modal Test Executor:** Manages the execution of tests involving single or multiple data modalities, ensuring appropriate data feeding and output collection.
5.  **Trustworthiness Assessment Engine:** Calculates quantitative metrics based on model outputs and potentially internal states (if accessible). This includes:
    *   **Accuracy Metrics:** Task-specific metrics (e.g., F1-score for diagnosis, ROUGE for summarization).
    *   **Robustness Metrics:** Performance degradation under simulated noise, missing data, or adversarial perturbations (e.g., using Projected Gradient Descent - PGD - attacks adapted for the data modality).
    *   **Fairness Metrics:** Calculation of bias measures, e.g., Statistical Parity Difference (SPD) or Equalized Odds Difference (EOD).
        $$ SPD = |P(\hat{Y}=1 | A=a) - P(\hat{Y}=1 | A=b)| $$
        where $\hat{Y}$ is the predicted outcome and $A$ is the sensitive attribute.
    *   **Explainability Metrics:** Assess clarity and faithfulness of explanations using methods like SHAP/LIME stability analysis or proxy metrics evaluating the model's ability to justify its outputs coherently.
    *   **Compliance Checks:** Rule-based checks (e.g., did the model access restricted data fields in simulation?) and potentially NLP-based assessment of output text against policy templates.
6.  **Clinician Feedback Interface:** A secure web-based interface presenting model outputs in context (alongside relevant synthetic patient data). Clinicians provide ratings (e.g., Likert scales for relevance, safety, clarity) and free-text comments. Feedback is quantitatively aggregated (e.g., average safety score) and qualitatively summarized.
7.  **Reporting Module:** Consolidates all quantitative metrics and clinician feedback into a comprehensive trustworthiness report, including risk scores, compliance summaries, and visualizations.

**Algorithmic Flow (Simplified Test Cycle):**

1.  Define scenario $S$ (task, population, modality, policy, challenges).
2.  Generate/select synthetic dataset $D_S$ matching $S$.
3.  For each data point $d \in D_S$:
    *   Input $d$ to GenAI model $M$.
    *   Collect output $o = M(d)$.
    *   (Optional) Apply perturbations $p$ to $d$, get $o' = M(d+p)$.
4.  Calculate automated metrics: $Metrics_{auto} = Calculate(O, D_S, S)$ (Accuracy, Robustness, Fairness, Explainability, Compliance).
5.  Select subset $O_{review} \subset O$ for clinician review.
6.  Present $O_{review}$ via Feedback Interface. Collect clinician ratings $R_{clin}$.
7.  Quantify feedback: $Metrics_{clin} = Aggregate(R_{clin})$.
8.  Compute overall Trustworthiness Score $T$, potentially a weighted sum:
    $$ T = \sum_{i} w_i \cdot Metric_i $$
    where $Metric_i \in \{Metrics_{auto}, Metrics_{clin}\}$ and $w_i$ are weights adaptable based on scenario $S$.
9.  Generate Report including $T$, individual metrics, qualitative feedback, and compliance assessment.

**3.4 Experimental Design and Validation**

The DyTrust-Health framework will be validated through carefully designed experiments:

*   **Case Studies:** We will select 2-3 distinct healthcare use cases:
    *   *Case Study 1 (Diagnosis Support):* GenAI model analyzing synthetic EHRs (text + tabular) to suggest differential diagnoses for common vs. rare pulmonary conditions. Evaluation focuses on accuracy, robustness to noisy data, fairness across demographics, and explainability of reasoning.
    *   *Case Study 2 (Treatment Recommendation):* Multi-modal GenAI (using synthetic text descriptions + image features) recommending treatment options for a specific cancer type, considering simulated genomic markers. Evaluation emphasizes safety (avoiding harmful suggestions), consistency across modalities, and clinician agreement with recommendations.
    *   *Case Study 3 (Patient Communication):* LLM generating simplified summaries of complex medical reports for patients. Evaluation focuses on clarity, accuracy, avoidance of jargon, and sensitivity, assessed primarily through clinician feedback and potentially NLP metrics compared against human-written summaries.
*   **Models Under Test:** We will select representative GenAI models, such as a fine-tuned version of a publicly available LLM (e.g., Llama-3, Mistral), a healthcare-specific LLM (if accessible), and potentially a multi-modal model (e.g., comparing against capabilities described for models like Med-PaLM M, even if the model itself isn't available, by testing open models on similar tasks).
*   **Baseline Comparison:** Where possible, we will compare the evaluation results obtained using DyTrust-Health against results from existing static benchmarks (e.g., standard accuracy metrics on public datasets relevant to the task) to demonstrate the added value of dynamic scenarios, edge cases, and multi-dimensional trustworthiness assessment.
*   **Ablation Studies:** We will systematically disable components of DyTrust-Health (e.g., remove clinician feedback, test only with common cases instead of edge cases, remove policy constraints) and measure the impact on the framework's ability to differentiate model performance and identify risks, thus demonstrating the contribution of each component.

**3.5 Evaluation Metrics (for the Framework)**

The effectiveness of the DyTrust-Health *framework itself* will be evaluated using metrics such as:

*   **Sensitivity:** Ability to detect known weaknesses or failure modes in GenAI models (e.g., demonstrating higher risk scores for models known to be biased).
*   **Discriminative Power:** Ability to differentiate meaningfully between the trustworthiness of different GenAI models or model versions.
*   **Reliability:** Consistency of evaluation results across repeated runs with similar configurations.
*   **Correlation with Expert Judgment:** Agreement between the framework's overall trustworthiness scores and independent assessments by clinical domain experts.
*   **Adaptability:** Ease and efficiency of incorporating new scenarios, policies, data modalities, or GenAI models into the framework.
*   **Usability:** Feedback from target users (developers, clinicians) on the framework's ease of use and the utility of its reports.
