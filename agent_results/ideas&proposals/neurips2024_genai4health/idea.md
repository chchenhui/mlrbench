**Title:** Dynamic Benchmarking Framework for Trustworthy GenAI in Healthcare  

**Motivation:** GenAI models like LLMs and multi-modal systems face skepticism in healthcare due to inconsistent safety evaluations across diverse clinical scenarios. Current benchmarks often lack adaptability to evolving policies, rare conditions, or contextual nuances, risking unreliable deployments and ethical disparities.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a dynamic benchmarking framework that evaluates GenAI modelsâ€™ trustworthiness by simulating diverse healthcare contexts (e.g., rare diseases, multi-ethnic patient data) and policy constraints. The framework will integrate:  
1. **Synthetic data generators** to create edge cases and policy-compliant scenarios (e.g., HIPAA-aligned synthetic records).  
2. **Multi-modal input testing** (text, imaging, genomics) to assess consistency and reliability.  
3. **Real-time clinician feedback loops** to validate outputs against clinical standards.  
4. **Explainability metrics** quantifying decision transparency for regulators.  
The framework will output risk scores and compliance reports, enabling iterative model refinement. Collaborations with clinicians and policymakers will ensure alignment with real-world needs. Expected outcomes include standardized, adaptive benchmarks for GenAI safety, fostering trust and accelerating ethical adoption in healthcare.
