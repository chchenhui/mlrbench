# TrustMed: Establishing Trust in Healthcare GenAI through Transparent Policy Adherence

## Motivation
While Generative AI (GenAI) offers transformative potential in healthcare, widespread adoption is hindered by trust deficits due to compliance uncertainties with healthcare policies and regulations. Current approaches often treat policy compliance as an afterthought rather than an integrated design element. This research addresses the critical gap between technical innovation and regulatory requirements by creating a framework that embeds policy compliance throughout the GenAI development lifecycle, thus fostering stakeholder trust and facilitating responsible deployment.

## Main Idea
TrustMed is a comprehensive framework that integrates policy compliance directly into GenAI healthcare model development. The approach has three key components: (1) A policy-to-technical requirements translator that converts healthcare regulations (HIPAA, FDA guidelines, etc.) into concrete technical specifications; (2) A continuous compliance verification system that monitors model behavior against these specifications during development, fine-tuning, and deployment; and (3) An interpretable compliance report generator that provides stakeholders with transparent documentation of how the GenAI system adheres to relevant policies. The framework will be validated through case studies in clinical decision support and patient communication domains. By making policy compliance verifiable and transparent, TrustMed aims to accelerate responsible GenAI adoption in healthcare while establishing standards for trustworthy AI governance.
