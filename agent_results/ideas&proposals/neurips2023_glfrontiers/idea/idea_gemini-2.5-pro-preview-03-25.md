**Title:** Graph-Guided Iterative Reasoning for Enhanced LLM Factuality

**Motivation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text but often struggle with complex reasoning and factual accuracy, particularly when requiring multi-hop inferences grounded in structured knowledge. Existing retrieval-augmented methods fetch relevant facts but lack mechanisms to guide the LLM's reasoning process using the inherent relational structure of knowledge graphs (KGs).

**Main Idea:** We propose an iterative framework where an LLM collaborates with a KG for step-by-step reasoning. Given a query, the LLM generates a potential reasoning step or sub-query. This hypothesis is then translated into a graph operation (e.g., path query, subgraph validation) executed on the KG. The verified results or identified inconsistencies from the KG are fed back to the LLM, prompting it to refine its reasoning or generate the next step. This loop continues until a final answer grounded in the KG is derived. This explicit graph-guided reasoning process aims to significantly reduce hallucinations, improve faithfulness in knowledge-intensive tasks, and enable verifiable multi-step logical deductions.
