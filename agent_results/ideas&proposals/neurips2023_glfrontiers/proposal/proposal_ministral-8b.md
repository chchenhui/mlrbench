# GraphLang: A Unified Graph-Language Foundation Model

## Introduction

Graph-structured data, ubiquitous in knowledge bases, molecules, social networks, and more, presents a rich source of information that remains largely inaccessible via natural language interfaces. The integration of graph learning with large language models (LLMs) can democratize graph data exploration, empowering users to query, reason about, and modify complex graphs through intuitive text prompts. This research proposal outlines the development of GraphLang, a multi-modal Transformer pretrained on paired graph–text corpora, and instruction-tuned for interactive graph reasoning.

### Research Objectives

1. **Motivation**: To bridge the gap between graph-structured data and natural language interfaces, enabling users to interact with graphs intuitively.
2. **Pretraining**: To develop a multi-modal Transformer model pretrained on graph–text corpora from diverse domains.
3. **Instruction Tuning**: To fine-tune the model on synthetic "graph reasoning" dialogues, teaching it to extract or update subgraphs from natural language queries.
4. **Evaluation**: To assess the model's performance in zero-shot graph QA, interactive subgraph retrieval, and language-driven graph editing.

### Significance

GraphLang aims to democratize graph data exploration by making it accessible to scientists and practitioners without specialized tooling. By enabling zero-shot graph QA and interactive subgraph retrieval, GraphLang can significantly enhance the usability and impact of graph learning across various domains.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

GraphLang will be pretrained on three types of graph–text corpora:

1. **Knowledge Graphs**: Graphs representing structured knowledge from sources such as Wikidata, DBpedia, and YAGO.
2. **Molecular Datasets**: Graphs representing molecular structures and properties from databases such as PubChem and ChEMBL.
3. **Scene Graphs**: Graphs representing scenes and objects from datasets like Visual Genome and COCO.

### Pretraining Tasks

1. **Masked Node/Edge Reconstruction**: Mask out nodes or edges in a graph and predict their values based on the context provided by the remaining graph and text descriptions.
2. **Graph-to-Text Generation**: Generate textual descriptions of graphs, focusing on capturing the essential structure and relationships.
3. **Contrastive Alignment**: Learn embeddings for subgraphs and align them with corresponding text descriptions using contrastive learning.

### Instruction Tuning

GraphLang will be fine-tuned on synthetic "graph reasoning" dialogues, teaching it to:

1. **Extract Subgraphs**: Given a natural language query, extract relevant subgraphs from the graph.
2. **Update Subgraphs**: Modify subgraphs based on natural language instructions, such as adding or removing nodes/edges.

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Zero-shot Graph QA**: Measure the model's ability to answer graph-related questions without task-specific training.
2. **Interactive Subgraph Retrieval**: Evaluate the model's performance in retrieving relevant subgraphs based on natural language queries.
3. **Language-driven Graph Editing**: Assess the model's ability to modify subgraphs based on natural language instructions.

### Experimental Design

1. **Datasets**: Use the pretraining datasets described above for initial evaluation.
2. **Baselines**: Compare GraphLang's performance against existing graph learning and LLM models, such as GraphText, GraphGPT, and GraphLLM.
3. **Validation**: Validate the model's performance on domain-specific datasets, such as molecular datasets for drug discovery and knowledge graphs for scientific discovery.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Zero-shot Graph QA

GraphLang's ability to answer graph-related questions without task-specific training will enable users to query complex graphs intuitively, facilitating rapid discovery and decision-making.

### Interactive Subgraph Retrieval

By retrieving relevant subgraphs based on natural language queries, GraphLang will empower users to explore graphs interactively, uncovering hidden insights and relationships.

### Language-driven Graph Editing

GraphLang's capacity to modify subgraphs based on natural language instructions will democratize graph data exploration, enabling users to manipulate graphs to suit their needs without specialized tooling.

### Generalization Across Domains

By pretraining on diverse graph–text corpora and fine-tuning on synthetic dialogues, GraphLang aims to generalize effectively across various domains and graph types, reducing the need for extensive retraining.

### Trustworthiness and Explainability

To ensure trustworthiness and explainability, GraphLang will incorporate techniques such as adversarial robustness, explainable ML, and causal inference, making it applicable in mission-critical use cases.

### Future Work

Future work will focus on extending GraphLang's capabilities to handle multimodal data, such as integrating image and text data to enhance graph reasoning. Additionally, research will explore the model's performance on heterophilic graphs and its potential applications in scientific discovery.

In conclusion, GraphLang aims to bridge the gap between graph-structured data and natural language interfaces, empowering users to interact with graphs intuitively and unlocking graph insights across domains. By combining graph learning with large language models, GraphLang has the potential to democratize graph data exploration and drive scientific discovery.
