**Research Proposal: GraphLang: A Unified Graph-Language Foundation Model**  

---

## 1. **Introduction**  

### **Background**  
Graph-structured data underpins critical applications in knowledge representation, molecular science, social networks, and more. However, interacting with such data requires specialized tools and expertise, limiting accessibility for non-technical users. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-AI interaction via natural language (NL) interfaces. Recent studies (e.g., GraphText, GraphGPT) demonstrate nascent efforts to integrate graph reasoning with LLMs, but key gaps persist:  
- Most frameworks treat graphs as auxiliary data, lacking bidirectional understanding between graphs and language.  
- Existing methods focus on specific graph types (e.g., knowledge graphs), limiting generalization.  
- Interactive graph editing and domain adaptation remain understudied.  

### **Research Objectives**  
This work proposes **GraphLang**, a unified graph-language foundation model, to bridge structured graph reasoning and natural language interaction. Key objectives include:  
1. Develop a multi-modal Transformer architecture pretrained on diverse graphâ€“text pairs (e.g., knowledge graphs, molecules).  
2. Enable **zero-shot graph querying, reasoning, and editing** via natural language.  
3. Validate performance across domains (biology, chemistry, social networks) against supervised GNNs and LLM-based baselines.  

### **Significance**  
GraphLang democratizes access to graph analytics by replacing specialized query languages (e.g., SPARQL) with intuitive NL interfaces. It advances graph foundation models by unifying structural and semantic reasoning, accelerating scientific discovery (e.g., drug design) and enabling cross-domain knowledge transfer.

## 2. **Methodology**  

### **Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
**Sources**:  
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Wikidata, Freebase.  
- **Molecular Graphs**: DrugBank, PubChem.  
- **Scene Graphs**: Visual Genome.  
- **Text-Graph Pairs**: Extract textual descriptions of subgraphs (e.g., "protein X interacts with kinase Y in pathway Z").  

**Alignment Strategy**:  
- **Structural Encoding**: Represent graphs as adjacency matrices with node/edge attributes.  
- **Textual Encoding**: Use existing LLMs (e.g., Llama-2) to generate coherent descriptions of subgraphs.  
- **Synthetic Dialogue Generation**: Create "graph reasoning" dialogues via template-based generation and LLM paraphrasing.  

### **Model Architecture**  
GraphLang employs a dual-encoder Transformer with cross-modal attention:  
- **Graph Encoder**: Processes nodes $\mathbf{v}_i$ and edges $\mathbf{e}_{ij}$ using relational attention:  
  $$  
  \alpha_{ij} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{(\mathbf{W}_Q \mathbf{v}_i)^T (\mathbf{W}_K \mathbf{v}_j + \mathbf{W}_E \mathbf{e}_{ij})}{\sqrt{d}}\right)  
  $$  
  where $\mathbf{W}_Q, \mathbf{W}_K, \mathbf{W}_E$ are learnable weights.  
- **Text Encoder**: Standard Transformer encoder for token sequences.  
- **Cross-Modal Fusion Layer**: Align graph and text embeddings via contrastive learning.  

### **Pretraining Tasks**  
1. **Masked Graph Reconstruction**:  
   Mask 15% of nodes/edges; predict attributes using graph-text context. Loss:  
   $$  
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}} = \mathbb{E}_{(G,T)}\left[\sum_{m \in \mathcal{M}} \log P(m \mid G_{\backslash m}, T)\right]  
   $$  
2. **Graph-to-Text Generation**:  
   Generate text $T$ given $G$, optimized via cross-entropy loss.  
3. **Contrastive Alignment**:  
   Maximize similarity between aligned graph-text pairs:  
   $$  
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{align}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{h}_G, \mathbf{h}_T))}{\sum_{(\mathbf{h}_G', \mathbf{h}_T')}\exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{h}_G', \mathbf{h}_T'))}  
   $$  

### **Instruction Tuning**  
Train on synthetic dialogues to equip GraphLang with interactive reasoning:  
- **Input**: User query (e.g., "Find proteins inhibiting kinase X") + graph context.  
- **Output**: Subgraph extraction, NL explanation, or graph modification.  
- **Synthetic Data**: 100k dialogues generated via GPT-4, covering edge cases (e.g., ambiguous queries).  

### **Experimental Design**  

**Baselines**:  
- **GNNs**: GCN, GraphSAGE.  
- **LLM-Based**: GraphText, GraphGPT, GPT-4 with graph-to-text conversion.  

**Tasks**:  
1. **Zero-Shot Graph QA**: Answer questions on WikiData and DrugBank using only NL input.  
2. **Subgraph Retrieval**: Precision@K for retrieving relevant subgraphs from NL queries.  
3. **Graph Editing**: Success rate in updating graphs per NL instructions (e.g., "Add a covalent bond between atoms 5 and 7").  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
- **Accuracy**: For QA and editing tasks.  
- **BLEU, ROUGE**: Text generation quality.  
- **Subgraph F1**: Overlap between retrieved and ground-truth subgraphs.  
- **Diversity**: Unique valid edits proposed for ambiguous prompts.  

**Datasets**:  
- **Training**: Combined Wikidata, DrugBank, Visual Genome (1M+ graph-text pairs).  
- **Testing**:  
  - **Biomedical**: COVID-19 literature graphs.  
  - **Social Networks**: Reddit discussion threads.

## 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

### **Technical Contributions**  
1. **First Unified Graph-Language Model**: GraphLang bridges graph reasoning and NL interaction, supporting both subgraph retrieval and language-driven editing.  
2. **Scalable Pretraining Framework**: Our multi-task approach enables generalization across heterogeneous graphs.  
3. **Interactive Dialogue**: Instruction tuning enables iterative refinement of graph queries.  

### **Empirical Results**  
- **Superior Zero-Shot Performance**: GraphLang is expected to outperform GPT-4 on graph QA by >15% accuracy and match supervised GNNs on retrieval tasks.  
- **Cross-Domain Adaptation**: The model will show robust performance on unseen domains (e.g., neuroscience connectomes) with minimal fine-tuning.  

### **Societal Impact**  
- **Democratizing Graph Analytics**: Scientists and policymakers can explore graph data without coding expertise.  
- **Accelerating Discovery**: Applications in drug repurposing, material design, and social network analysis will benefit from NL-driven insights.  

### **Future Directions**  
- **Multimodal Expansion**: Integrate images and sensor data into GraphLang.  
- **Federated Learning**: Enable privacy-preserving graph analysis across institutions.
