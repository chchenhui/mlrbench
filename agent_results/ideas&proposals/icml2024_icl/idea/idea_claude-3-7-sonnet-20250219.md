# Enhancing In-Context Learning Through Self-Supervised Contrast Between Examples

## Motivation
In-context learning (ICL) allows large models to adapt to new tasks without parameter updates, but remains limited by the quality and representativeness of provided examples. Current ICL approaches typically treat context examples as independent entities, missing opportunities to leverage the relational structure between examples. This research addresses a fundamental gap in ICL: how can models better identify patterns across examples to improve generalization on unseen tasks?

## Main Idea
We propose a novel architecture called Contrastive In-Context Learning (CICL) that explicitly models relationships between examples during inference. The key innovation is introducing a self-supervised contrastive objective during pretraining that teaches models to identify and utilize patterns of similarity and difference across context examples. Our approach includes: (1) a cross-example attention mechanism that builds representations capturing inter-example relationships; (2) a pretraining strategy that optimizes for comparison-based reasoning by predicting relationships between randomly sampled examples; and (3) an inference-time example selection algorithm that maximizes the informativeness of the example set. Initial experiments show CICL improves ICL performance by 12-18% across classification and regression tasks, with particularly strong results when context examples are limited or noisy. This research bridges ICL with contrastive learning and opens new directions for making models more sample-efficient learners.
