Title  
Contrastive In-Context Learning (CICL): Leveraging Self-Supervised Cross-Example Relationships for Enhanced In-Context Generalization  

1. Introduction  

Background  
In-context learning (ICL) in large pre-trained models enables rapid adaptation to new tasks by conditioning on a small set of labeled examples—without any gradient updates or fine-tuning. While promising, existing ICL methods treat each demonstration example independently and rely heavily on the representativeness and quality of these examples. This independence assumption discards potentially valuable relational information: similarities, differences, and higher-order patterns across examples that human learners naturally exploit when reasoning by analogy or contrast.  

Research Objectives  
We propose to overcome these limitations by introducing Contrastive In-Context Learning (CICL), a new architecture and training paradigm that explicitly models and leverages inter-example relationships. Our objectives are:  
  • To design a cross-example attention mechanism that builds enriched context representations capturing pairwise and group-wise relations among demonstration examples.  
  • To develop a self-supervised contrastive pretraining objective that teaches the model comparison-based reasoning: distinguishing which pairs of context examples share task-relevant features or labels.  
  • To create an inference-time example selection algorithm that chooses the most informative and diverse subset of demonstrations for any new query.  
  • To empirically evaluate CICL’s impact on few-shot classification, regression, and sequence generation tasks, under varying context sizes and noise levels.  

Significance  
By bridging contrastive learning with in-context adaptation, CICL addresses key challenges in ICL: robustness to noisy or limited contexts, improved sample-efficiency, and stronger generalization across domains. CICL’s cross-example inductive bias can reduce example count requirements by up to 20% while maintaining or improving accuracy, paving the way for more reliable, interpretable, and resource-efficient few-shot systems.  

2. Methodology  

Overview  
CICL consists of three major components: (1) a **Cross-Example Attention Transformer** (CEAT) that augments standard transformer layers with inter-example attention heads; (2) a **Self-Supervised Contrastive Pretraining** strategy that uses an InfoNCE-style loss to teach the model to group related examples; and (3) an **Inference-Time Example Selection** algorithm maximizing the informativeness and diversity of chosen demonstrations.  

2.1 Cross-Example Attention Transformer (CEAT)  

2.1.1 Architecture  
Given a demonstration set $D=\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^m$ of $m$ input-label pairs, we first encode each example through a shared embedding and token encoder (e.g., BPE embedding + Transformer encoder) to obtain per-example representations $H_i\in\mathbb{R}^{T\times d}$, where $T$ is the token length and $d$ the model hidden dimension. We then compute an **example-level summary** $h_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$ via mean-pooling or the [CLS] token:  
$$
h_i = \frac1T\sum_{t=1}^T H_i[t]\quad\text{or}\quad h_i = H_i[\text{CLS}]\,.  
$$  

To capture inter-example relations, we introduce specialized **cross-example attention layers**. For each example summary $h_i$, we compute queries, keys, and values via learnable projections $W_Q,W_K,W_V\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, then attend across the set $\{h_j\}_{j=1}^m$:  
$$
\alpha_{i,j} = \frac{\exp\bigl(\langle W_Q h_i,\;W_K h_j\rangle / \sqrt{d}\bigr)}{\sum_{k=1}^m \exp\bigl(\langle W_Q h_i,\;W_K h_k\rangle / \sqrt{d}\bigr)},  
\qquad  
\tilde h_i = \sum_{j=1}^m \alpha_{i,j}\,W_V h_j.  
$$  
We then fuse $\tilde h_i$ back into the token-level representations via a residual connection and feed-forward layer, enabling subsequent layers to attend both within examples and across examples.  

2.1.2 Layer Stacking  
A typical CEAT block consists of:  
  1. **Within-Example Self-Attention** (standard transformer layer).  
  2. **Cross-Example Attention** (as defined above).  
  3. **Feed-Forward Network** and LayerNorms.  
Repeating $L$ such blocks yields a model that integrates fine-grained token information with global example relationships.  

2.2 Self-Supervised Contrastive Pretraining  

2.2.1 Pair Sampling Strategy  
During pretraining, we randomly sample mini-batches of $B$ examples from the base corpus. We form positive and negative pairs at the example level:  
  • **Positive Pair** $(i,j)$ if examples $i,j$ are drawn from the same task family or share the same label.  
  • **Negative Pair** otherwise.  

2.2.2 Contrastive Loss  
Following InfoNCE, for each anchor $h_i$ we define one positive $h_j^+$ and $N-1$ negatives $\{h_k^-\}_{k=1}^{N-1}$. The contrastive loss for anchor $i$ is:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_i = -\log \frac{\exp(\mathrm{sim}(h_i,h_j^+)/\tau)}{\exp(\mathrm{sim}(h_i,h_j^+)/\tau)\;+\;\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\exp(\mathrm{sim}(h_i,h_k^-)/\tau)},  
$$  
where $\mathrm{sim}(u,v)=u^\top v/\|u\|\|v\|$ and $\tau>0$ is a temperature hyperparameter. The total loss over a batch is $\mathcal{L}=\frac1B\sum_{i=1}^B\mathcal{L}_i$.  

2.2.3 Joint Pretraining Objective  
We integrate $\mathcal{L}$ with the standard language modeling or sequence-to-sequence loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{LM}}$ used in base pretraining:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{joint}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{LM}} + \lambda\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}},  
$$  
where $\lambda$ balances the two objectives. This joint objective teaches the model both to generate coherent text and to internalize cross-example relational structures.  

2.3 Inference-Time Example Selection  

2.3.1 Scoring and Diversity  
At inference, given a pool of unlabeled candidate examples $C=\{(x_k,y_k)\}_{k=1}^N$ and a new query $q$, we first encode each $x_k$ to obtain $h_k$ and compute a **relevance score** $s_k=\mathrm{sim}(h_k,h_q)$. To encourage diversity, we also penalize high pairwise similarity between selected examples. We pose selection as:  
$$
\max_{S\subset C,\;|S|=m}\;\sum_{i\in S} s_i\;-\;\gamma\sum_{i,j\in S,\,i<j}\mathrm{sim}(h_i,h_j),  
$$  
where $\gamma\ge0$ trades off relevance vs. redundancy.  

2.3.2 Greedy Algorithm  
We employ a simple greedy selection (Algorithm 1) that iteratively adds the candidate with maximum marginal gain:  

Algorithm 1: Greedy Example Selection  
Input: candidate set $C$, scores $s_i$, embeddings $\{h_i\}$, diversity weight $\gamma$, budget $m$  
Initialize $S\leftarrow\emptyset$.  
For $t=1$ to $m$:  
  For each $k\in C\setminus S$, compute  
  $\Delta_k = s_k - \gamma\sum_{j\in S}\mathrm{sim}(h_k,h_j)$.  
  Select $k^*=\arg\max_k\Delta_k$. Add $k^*$ to $S$.  
Return $S$.  

2.4 Fine-Tuning vs. Zero-Shot Inference  
After pretraining, we evaluate two modes:  
  • **Zero-Shot ICL**: Directly apply the frozen CICL model with cross-example attention and selection on new tasks.  
  • **Few-Shot Fine-Tuning**: Optionally fine-tune a small adapter layer using $<100$ labeled examples per task to test sample-efficiency gains.  

2.5 Experimental Design  

2.5.1 Datasets and Tasks  
  • **Text Classification**: GLUE (MNLI, SST-2), SuperGLUE (BoolQ, RTE) in 5-shot and 10-shot regimes.  
  • **Regression**: Synthetic polynomial regression tasks, real‐world datasets (Boston Housing), measuring MSE.  
  • **Sequence Generation**: Story completion (ROCStories), WikiBio to test generation quality.  
  • **Noisy & Limited Context**: We inject label noise into demonstrations at rates {10%,20%,30%} and vary $m$ from 2 to 20.  

2.5.2 Baselines  
  • **Standard ICL** with random example selection.  
  • **ICCD** (Peng et al. 2025) and **c-ICL** (Mo et al. 2024).  
  • **CEIL** (Ye et al. 2023) using DPP-based selection.  
  • **CL-Pretrain** (Johnson et al. 2023) without cross-example attention.  

2.5.3 Evaluation Metrics  
  • **Classification**: Accuracy, F1, calibration error (ECE).  
  • **Regression**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R².  
  • **Generation**: BLEU, ROUGE-L, human quality ratings on coherence.  
  • **Efficiency**: Context size $m$ vs. accuracy trade-off curves; inference latency.  
  • **Ablations**: Removing cross-example layers, contrastive loss, or selection module.  

2.5.4 Statistical Significance  
We run each experiment over 5 random seeds and report mean±std. Significance is tested with paired t-tests ($p<0.05$).  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

3.1 Quantitative Gains  
  • **Performance Improvement**: We anticipate 12–18% relative error reduction on classification/regression tasks compared to standard ICL, especially at low $m\le5$.  
  • **Noise Robustness**: CICL should degrade gracefully under label noise, outperforming baselines by ≥10% at 20% noise.  
  • **Context Efficiency**: We expect to match baseline accuracy with 20–30% fewer examples by leveraging relational context.  

3.2 Qualitative Insights  
  • **Interpretability**: Analysis of cross-example attention weights will reveal which demonstration pairs most influence decisions, offering insight into contrastive reasoning patterns.  
  • **Task Transfer**: We hypothesize CICL will generalize better to out‐of‐domain tasks (e.g., transfer from sentiment to topic classification) by focusing on relational features.  

3.3 Theoretical Contributions  
This work will deliver a principled integration of contrastive objectives and transformer architectures in the ICL paradigm. We will provide theoretical arguments—based on information-theoretic bounds—on why contrastive pretraining tightens generalization error in low-shot contexts.  

3.4 Broader Impacts  
  • **Sample Efficiency**: CICL enables powerful few-shot learners in resource‐constrained settings (e.g., medical, legal), reducing annotation costs.  
  • **Safety & Reliability**: By modeling inter-example structure, CICL can detect and down-weight anomalous or adversarial examples, enhancing robustness and trust.  
  • **Foundations for AutoML**: Our example-selection algorithm can be extended to automated demonstration engineering, bridging ICL with AutoML.  

3.5 Future Directions  
  • **Multimodal CICL**: Extending cross-example attention and contrastive pretraining to image-text pairs.  
  • **Hierarchical Example Relations**: Modeling group-wise or hierarchical clusters of examples for complex tasks.  
  • **Human-in-the-Loop Selection**: Incorporating user feedback into the selection module to refine demonstration sets interactively.
