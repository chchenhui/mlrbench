1. **Title**: Physics-Informed Deep Equilibrium Models for Analog Hardware Co-Design  

2. **Motivation**: Analog and neuromorphic hardware offer energy-efficient compute capabilities but suffer from noise, limited precision, and incomplete operability, which hinder traditional model deployment. Deep equilibrium networks (DEQs) compute outputs as fixed points of iterative dynamical systems, resembling physical systems’ natural convergence. By co-designing DEQs with analog hardware, we can exploit hardware’s inherent dynamics to accelerate equilibrium-based inference and training, bypassing bottlenecks of traditional architectures.  

3. **Main Idea**: Propose a hybrid analog-digital DEQ framework where analog circuits *natively implement* the dynamical system’s convergence phase. Digital layers parameterize the system’s input and feedback terms, while analog hardware “solves” the equilibrium state via physical dynamics. Training uses a physics-aware differentiable proxy to simulate analog behavior (noise, low precision) during backpropagation, ensuring robustness to hardware imperfections. Expected outcomes include order-of-magnitude reductions in energy and time for tasks requiring sequential state convergence (e.g., control systems, physics simulations). This synergy could catalyze sustainable, scalable analog-ML systems for applications like edge robotics and real-time optimization, redefining ML-model/hardware co-design.
