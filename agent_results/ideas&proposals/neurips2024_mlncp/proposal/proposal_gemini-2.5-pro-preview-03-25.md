## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **Physics-Informed Deep Equilibrium Models for Efficient Analog Hardware Co-Design**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1. Background**
The relentless progress of machine learning (ML), particularly generative AI and large-scale deep learning models, is creating an exponential surge in computational demand (Thompson et al., 2020). This trend runs headlong into the fundamental physical limitations of digital computing based on the von Neumann architecture, leading to escalating energy consumption and diminishing returns in performance scaling – the so-called "AI compute wall" (Leiserson et al., 2020). To sustain the advancement of AI and mitigate its environmental footprint, exploring alternative, non-traditional computing paradigms is becoming increasingly critical. Analog computing, neuromorphic hardware, and other physical systems offer tantalizing prospects for orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and speed by leveraging physical phenomena directly for computation (Marković et al., 2020; Datar & Saha, 2024).

However, these emerging hardware platforms present unique challenges. Unlike their digital counterparts, analog systems are inherently susceptible to thermal noise, manufacturing variations (device mismatch), limited precision (low bit-depth), and often support a restricted set of mathematical operations (Datar & Saha, 2024). Directly deploying standard deep learning models, meticulously designed for the noise-free, high-precision digital domain, onto such hardware often results in significant performance degradation or outright failure. This necessitates a paradigm shift towards co-designing ML models and algorithms *with* the underlying hardware, embracing its characteristics rather than solely mitigating them.

Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) (Bai et al., 2019) represent a promising class of models for such co-design efforts. DEQs compute the output of a layer by finding the fixed point $z^*$ of an implicitly defined non-linear dynamical system $z \leftarrow f_\theta(z, x)$, where $x$ is the input and $\theta$ represents the model parameters. This fixed-point computation inherently resembles the convergence process of many physical systems towards equilibrium states. This conceptual alignment suggests that the physical dynamics of analog hardware could potentially be harnessed to *natively* and efficiently perform the core computational step of DEQs – finding the equilibrium point. While techniques like Equilibrium Propagation (Scellier & Bengio, 2017) and related methods (Nest & Ernoult, 2024) have explored energy-based models and their training, and Physics-Aware Training (PAT) (Wright et al., 2021) has shown promise for training physical systems, a dedicated framework leveraging analog dynamics specifically for accelerating DEQ fixed-point convergence while ensuring robustness through physics-informed training is still lacking.

**2.2. Problem Statement**
The primary challenge lies in effectively bridging the gap between the mathematically ideal formulation of DEQs and the physically constrained, noisy reality of analog hardware. How can we design DEQs such that their computationally intensive fixed-point iterations can be offloaded to analog circuits, exploiting their natural dynamics for rapid, low-energy convergence? Furthermore, how can we train such hybrid systems effectively, ensuring the learned digital parameters lead to robust performance despite the inherent imperfections (noise, limited precision, device mismatch) of the analog components? Existing approaches either focus on purely digital DEQ implementations or train general physical systems without specifically targeting the DEQ structure and its unique training dynamics (implicit differentiation).

**2.3. Research Objectives**
This research aims to develop a novel framework for co-designing DEQs with analog hardware, leveraging physics-informed training principles. The specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Hybrid Analog-Digital DEQ Architecture:** Design a DEQ framework where the fixed-point iteration $z \leftarrow f_\theta(z, x)$ is partially or fully implemented using analog circuitry, whose physical dynamics naturally drive the system towards equilibrium $z^*$. Digital components will manage input injection ($x$), parameter control ($\theta$), and potentially complex non-linear transformations within $f_\theta$.
2.  **Design a Physics-Informed Differentiable Proxy for Analog Dynamics:** Create a differentiable software model (the "proxy") that accurately captures the key characteristics of the target analog hardware implementation, including its temporal dynamics, noise profile, limited precision, and potential device mismatches. This proxy will be used during the backward pass of training.
3.  **Develop a Robust Training Algorithm:** Formulate a training algorithm that utilizes the physics-informed proxy for gradient computation. This involves adapting the implicit differentiation technique used for standard DEQs to work through the noisy, dynamic proxy, ensuring the learned parameters are robust to hardware imperfections. Inspiration will be drawn from PAT (Wright et al., 2021) and gradient computation in hybrid systems (Nest & Ernoult, 2024).
4.  **Simulate and Evaluate the Hybrid DEQ System:** Implement the proposed framework in simulation, modeling representative analog circuit dynamics (e.g., RC circuits, operational amplifier networks, or simplified memristor crossbar models). Evaluate its performance, energy efficiency (estimated), and convergence speed on benchmark tasks compared to purely digital DEQ implementations and standard models.
5.  **Analyze Robustness and Scalability:** Investigate the robustness of the trained hybrid DEQ to varying levels of simulated analog noise, precision limitations, and device mismatch. Analyze the potential scalability of the approach to larger models and more complex tasks.

**2.4. Significance**
This research holds significant potential for advancing the field of machine learning and hardware co-design. Successfully leveraging analog dynamics for DEQ computation could lead to:

*   **Step-Change in Efficiency:** Potential for orders-of-magnitude reduction in energy consumption and inference time for DEQs, particularly for tasks requiring deep or complex equilibrium computations.
*   **Enabling New Applications:** Making complex models like DEQs practical for resource-constrained edge devices (e.g., robotics, IoT sensors, real-time control systems) where digital implementations are infeasible due to power or latency constraints.
*   **Sustainable AI:** Contributing to more energy-efficient AI by reducing the reliance on power-hungry digital hardware.
*   **Advancing Analog ML:** Providing a concrete methodology for effectively training ML models that directly incorporate and exploit the behavior of analog hardware, addressing key challenges highlighted by Datar & Saha (2024).
*   **New Co-Design Principles:** Establishing principles for designing ML models whose computational structure maps naturally onto the dynamics of physical systems, fostering deeper integration between algorithms and hardware.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1. Proposed Hybrid Analog-Digital DEQ Framework**
We propose a hybrid architecture where the core fixed-point finding process of a DEQ is accelerated using analog hardware. A standard DEQ layer computes its output $z^*$ by solving the fixed-point equation:
$$z^* = f_\theta(z^*, x)$$
where $x$ is the input, $z^*$ is the equilibrium state (output), and $f_\theta$ is a parameterized function, often a neural network block. In our hybrid approach, we partition $f_\theta$ and the iteration process.

Let the state update be written as $z_{k+1} = f_\theta(z_k, x)$. We propose to implement the core transformation and convergence using analog components. For instance, $f_\theta$ could be structured as:
$$f_\theta(z, x) = \sigma(W_{ff} x + W_{fb} z + b)$$
Here, $W_{ff}$, $W_{fb}$, and $b$ are parameters typically implemented digitally for control and learning. The matrix multiplications ($W_{ff}x$, $W_{fb}z$) and accumulation could potentially be performed using analog vector-matrix multipliers (e.g., memristor crossbars or capacitor arrays). The crucial aspect is that the *iteration* $z_{k+1} \leftarrow \dots$ is mapped onto the time evolution of a physical system.

Consider an analog circuit whose state $v(t)$ (e.g., capacitor voltages) evolves according to a differential equation:
$$\tau \frac{dv(t)}{dt} = -v(t) + g_{\phi}(v(t), u)$$
where $u$ represents external input currents/voltages controlled digitally (derived from $x$ and potentially parts of $f_\theta$), and $g_{\phi}$ represents the analog circuit's internal dynamics and transformations, possibly parameterized by $\phi$ (representing physical device properties). The equilibrium state $v^*$ satisfies $v^* = g_{\phi}(v^*, u)$. If we design the circuit such that its equilibrium state $v^*$ corresponds to the desired DEQ fixed point $z^*$ (i.e., $g_{\phi}(v^*, u) \approx f_\theta(z^*, x)$ when $v^* \equiv z^*$), then the analog circuit's physical settling dynamics directly compute the fixed point. The digital components would set the inputs $u$ based on $x$ and learned parameters $\theta$ (which might influence $\phi$ or $u$), initiate the analog computation, and read out the settled state $v^*$ once equilibrium is reached (detected via thresholding change rates or after a fixed time).

**3.2. Physics-Informed Differentiable Proxy**
Directly using the analog hardware dynamics within a standard backpropagation framework is generally intractable due to its non-differentiability (with respect to learned parameters), noise, and the difficulty of perfectly modeling its behavior. Following the principles of Physics-Aware Training (PAT) (Wright et al., 2021), we will develop a differentiable proxy model, $\hat{f}_{\theta, \psi}$, which simulates the *forward pass* behavior of the hybrid system during training. This proxy runs on digital hardware (e.g., GPU) during the training loop.

The proxy $\hat{f}_{\theta, \psi}$ must capture:
1.  **Temporal Dynamics:** It should model the convergence process, possibly using a discretized version of the underlying physical dynamics (e.g., Euler method for ODEs) or a simplified iterative map that mimics the settling time and behavior.
    $$\hat{z}_{k+1} = \hat{f}_{\theta, \psi}(\hat{z}_k, x)$$
2.  **Noise:** Inject realistic noise into the simulation, modeling thermal noise (e.g., additive Gaussian noise) and potentially quantization effects reflecting limited analog precision.
    $$\hat{z}_{k+1} = \hat{f}_{\theta, \psi}(\hat{z}_k, x) + \epsilon_{noise}$$
    where $\epsilon_{noise} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{noise})$.
3.  **Parameter Variations:** Model device mismatch or variability in analog components by introducing variations in the parameters $\psi$ of the proxy itself during training, sampled from a distribution reflecting expected hardware variations.
    $$\psi \sim P(\psi | \bar{\psi}, \sigma^2_{dev})$$
4.  **Limited Precision:** Simulate the effects of low bit-depth representations in the analog domain, potentially through quantization operations within the proxy.
    $$\hat{z}_{k+1} = Q(\hat{f}_{\theta, \psi}(\hat{z}_k, x) + \epsilon_{noise})$$
    where $Q(\cdot)$ is a quantization function.

The parameters $\psi$ of the proxy model itself (e.g., noise levels, time constants, mismatch distributions) will be calibrated based on characterization data from the target analog hardware (or realistic simulations thereof).

**3.3. Training Algorithm**
Training DEQs typically involves implicit differentiation to compute gradients. For a fixed point $z^* = f_\theta(z^*, x)$, the gradient of a loss $L$ with respect to $\theta$ can be computed as:
$$\frac{dL}{d\theta} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z^*} \frac{dz^*}{d\theta}$$
where $\frac{dz^*}{d\theta}$ is found by differentiating the fixed-point equation:
$$\frac{dz^*}{d\theta} = \frac{\partial f_\theta}{\partial z^*} \frac{dz^*}{d\theta} + \frac{\partial f_\theta}{\partial \theta}$$
$$ (I - \frac{\partial f_\theta}{\partial z^*}) \frac{dz^*}{d\theta} = \frac{\partial f_\theta}{\partial \theta} $$
$$\frac{dz^*}{d\theta} = (I - \frac{\partial f_\theta}{\partial z^*})^{-1} \frac{\partial f_\theta}{\partial \theta}$$
The term $v^T = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z^*} (I - \frac{\partial f_\theta}{\partial z^*})^{-1}$ is typically computed efficiently using another fixed-point iteration or iterative methods like GMRES/conjugate gradient.

In our hybrid approach, during training, the forward pass computes the equilibrium state $\hat{z}^*$ using the noisy, dynamic proxy $\hat{f}_{\theta, \psi}$:
$$\hat{z}^* \approx \text{solve}(\hat{z} = \hat{f}_{\theta, \psi}(\hat{z}, x))$$
For the backward pass, we will apply implicit differentiation *through the proxy model*. The Jacobian $\frac{\partial \hat{f}_{\theta, \psi}}{\partial \hat{z}^*}$ and the partial derivative $\frac{\partial \hat{f}_{\theta, \psi}}{\partial \theta}$ are computed based on the *proxy function's* analytical form (which is differentiable by design, despite simulating non-ideal effects). The gradients are then calculated as:
$$\frac{dL}{d\theta} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{z}^*} (I - \frac{\partial \hat{f}_{\theta, \psi}}{\partial \hat{z}^*})^{-1} \frac{\partial \hat{f}_{\theta, \psi}}{\partial \theta}$$
The vector-Jacobian product involving $(I - \frac{\partial \hat{f}_{\theta, \psi}}{\partial \hat{z}^*})^{-1}$ will again be solved iteratively. The crucial aspect is that the gradients $\frac{dL}{d\theta}$ are computed based on the *expected* behavior of the imperfect analog hardware (as modeled by the proxy), thus optimizing $\theta$ for robustness and effective utilization of the analog dynamics. This incorporates the physics-informed aspect directly into the gradient computation, analogous to PAT but tailored for the DEQ structure. We may also explore connections to techniques like eq-propagation (Nest & Ernoult, 2024) if energy-based formulations of the proxy dynamics prove beneficial for stability or gradient calculation.

**3.4. Data Collection and Simulation Environment**
We will initially focus on simulations due to the complexity of fabricating and characterizing custom analog hardware.
*   **Analog Hardware Simulation:** We will use circuit simulation tools (e.g., SPICE for small circuits) or abstracted numerical models (e.g., in Python using libraries like NumPy/SciPy) to model the behavior of candidate analog circuits (e.g., op-amp based integrators, potentially models of memristive crossbars for VMM). These simulations will provide realistic parameters (time constants, noise levels, variation statistics) for calibrating the differentiable proxy $\hat{f}_{\theta, \psi}$.
*   **Datasets:** We will evaluate the framework on standard image classification benchmarks (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10) for proof-of-concept and comparison with existing DEQ results. Additionally, we will target tasks where equilibrium finding is natural, such as:
    *   Small-scale physics simulation problems (e.g., predicting steady states of dynamical systems).
    *   Iterative optimization tasks (e.g., solving linear systems or quadratic programs, potentially relevant for control).
    *   Sequence modeling tasks where DEQs have shown promise (e.g., simple algorithmic tasks).

**3.5. Experimental Design and Evaluation**
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  Standard Digital DEQ: Trained and evaluated purely in digital simulation (e.g., PyTorch implementation).
    2.  Standard RNN/Transformer: On sequence or relevant tasks for performance comparison.
    3.  Naive Analog DEQ: A digital DEQ trained normally, then deployed onto the *simulated* noisy analog hardware model (without physics-informed training) to show the benefit of the proposed co-design/training approach.
    4.  Digital DEQ with Noise Injection: A digital DEQ trained with simple noise injection during training, but without the dynamic/physics-informed proxy, to isolate the benefit of modeling the hardware physics.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Task Performance:** Accuracy (classification), Mean Squared Error (regression/simulation), or task-specific metrics.
    2.  **Computational Cost (Simulated/Estimated):**
        *   Inference Latency: Measured by the number of iterations required in the digital simulation or the estimated settling time ($t_{settle}$) in the analog simulation. $t_{analog} \approx N_{steps} \times \Delta t_{analog}$ or direct simulation time. Compare $t_{analog}$ vs $t_{digital} = N_{iter} \times t_{layer}$.
        *   Energy Consumption: Estimated based on simulated analog circuit power draw (e.g., $E_{analog} \approx P_{avg\_analog} \times t_{settle}$) versus estimated digital energy ($E_{digital} \approx N_{ops} \times E_{op}$). Orders-of-magnitude comparisons will be the focus.
    3.  **Robustness:** Performance degradation under varying levels of simulated noise ($\sigma^2_{noise}$), precision (quantization levels), and parameter variations ($\sigma^2_{dev}$) injected *after* training.
    4.  **Convergence:** Analysis of fixed-point convergence speed (number of iterations/time) for both the proxy model and the simulated analog hardware.
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    1.  Impact of Proxy Components: Train models with/without noise modeling, with/without dynamic modeling, with/without precision modeling in the proxy to understand the contribution of each physics-informed component.
    2.  Sensitivity to Proxy Accuracy: Evaluate how performance degrades if the proxy parameters ($ \psi $) mismatch the simulated hardware characteristics.
    3.  Comparison of Analog Mappings: If multiple analog circuit concepts are explored, compare their resulting efficiency and robustness.
