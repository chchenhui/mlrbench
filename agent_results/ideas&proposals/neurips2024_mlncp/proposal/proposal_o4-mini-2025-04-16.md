Title  
Physics-Informed Deep Equilibrium Models for Analog Hardware Co-Design  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Modern machine learning demands are climbing steeply, driven by large language models, high-resolution vision, and real-time control. At the same time, digital computing is nearing physical and economic limits in performance scaling, energy consumption, and heat dissipation. Non-traditional compute paradigms—such as analog/differential circuits, neuromorphic devices, and physical dynamical systems—promise orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and latency. However, their adoption has been hindered by noise, device mismatch, limited precision, and a small set of reliably implemented operations.  

Deep Equilibrium Networks (DEQs) are an emerging class of implicit models whose outputs are defined as fixed points of dynamical systems: instead of stacking many layers, DEQs iterate a single transformation until convergence. Their natural formulation as equilibria meshes well with the physics of analog hardware: the physical dynamics of an electrical, optical, or mechanical system can “solve” the equilibrium for us, potentially at much lower energy cost than conventional digital iterations.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to co-design DEQs with analog hardware by:  
1. Developing hybrid analog-digital DEQ architectures whose equilibrium phase is executed natively on analog circuits.  
2. Formulating a physics-informed, differentiable proxy model of hardware dynamics (including noise, non-linearity, and quantization) to perform robust gradient‐based training.  
3. Demonstrating orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy and time per inference/training on benchmark tasks (image classification, control, and physics simulation) versus purely digital DEQs and feedforward networks.  
4. Validating the framework on both high‐fidelity analog hardware simulators and prototype physical platforms (e.g., memristor crossbars, analog electronic oscillators).  

Significance  
By tightly co-designing models and hardware, we expect to overcome longstanding barriers to analog deep learning, demonstrating not only efficient inference but also robust, scalable training. Such advances could reshape sustainable AI, enabling model classes (e.g., energy-based models, deep equilibrium networks) previously deemed too expensive, and pave the way for edge robotics and real-time optimization applications.  

2. Methodology  
2.1 Overview  
Our methodology comprises four phases: (A) Hybrid DEQ architecture design, (B) Physics-aware proxy modeling, (C) End-to-end training with implicit differentiation, and (D) Experimental validation and benchmarking.  

2.2 Hybrid Analog-Digital DEQ Architecture  
  • Architecture Definition  
    – Let $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^d$ be the input. A digital front-end encoder computes $\mathbf{u}=U_{\theta_u}(\mathbf{x})$, parameterized by weights $\theta_u$.  
    – An analog dynamical core realizes the iteration function  
      $$F(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{u},\theta_a)=\phi\bigl(W_a\mathbf{z}+U_a\mathbf{u}+b_a\bigr) + \eta(\mathbf{z}),$$  
      where $W_a,U_a,b_a$ are analog‐mapped matrices/vectors (programmed onto memristor crossbars or analog circuits), $\phi$ is a nonlinearity implementable in hardware (e.g., a saturating amplifier), and $\eta(\mathbf{z})$ models stochastic device noise/mismatch.  
    – The equilibrium $\mathbf{z}^*$ satisfies  
      $$\mathbf{z}^* = F(\mathbf{z}^*;\mathbf{u},\theta_a).$$  
    – A digital readout layer produces the output $\hat{\mathbf{y}}=D_{\theta_d}(\mathbf{z}^*)$.  

2.3 Physics-Aware Proxy Model  
  • Purpose: To simulate analog behavior during training and inject robustness to hardware imperfections.  
  • Noise and Mismatch Modeling  
    – We model device noise as additive Gaussian noise: $\eta(\mathbf{z})\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2\mathbf{I})$.  
    – Parameter quantization and mismatch are modeled by stochastic perturbations on $W_a,U_a$:  
      $$W_{\mathrm{noisy}} = W_a + \Delta W,\quad \Delta W_{ij}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\alpha^2\lvert W_{ij}\rvert).$$  
  • Proxy Dynamics  
    – The proxy iteration becomes  
      $$\mathbf{z}_{t+1} = \phi\bigl(W_{\mathrm{noisy}}\mathbf{z}_t + U_{\mathrm{noisy}}\mathbf{u} + b_a\bigr) + \eta(\mathbf{z}_t).$$  
    – We unroll $T$ steps to approximate the hardware’s equilibrium.  

2.4 End-to-End Training  
  • Implicit Differentiation for DEQ  
    – The loss on a batch $\mathcal{B}$ is  
      $$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \frac1{|\mathcal{B}|}\sum_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\in\mathcal{B}}\ell\bigl(D_{\theta_d}(\mathbf{z}^*(\mathbf{x})),\mathbf{y}\bigr),$$  
      where $\mathbf{z}^*(\mathbf{x})$ solves $\mathbf{z}=F(\mathbf{z};U_{\theta_u}(\mathbf{x}),\theta_a)$.  
    – Using implicit differentiation, gradients w.r.t. $\theta=(\theta_u,\theta_a,\theta_d)$ are computed as:  
      $$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta} = \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial \theta}\Big\vert_{\mathbf{z}^*} - \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial \mathbf{z}^*}\Bigl[\bigl(I-\tfrac{\partial F}{\partial \mathbf{z}}\bigr)^{-1}\frac{\partial F}{\partial \theta}\Bigr]\Big\vert_{\mathbf{z}^*}.$$  
    – In practice, we solve the linear system  
      $$(I - J_F^\top) \mathbf{v} = \bigl(\partial \ell/\partial \mathbf{z}^*\bigr)^\top$$  
      by fixed‐point iterations (Neumann series) or conjugate gradient, avoiding explicit Jacobian inversion.  

  • Physics-Informed Regularization  
    – To enforce stable equilibria, we add a Lyapunov‐inspired penalty:  
      $$R(\theta) = \lambda \,\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}}\bigl[\|\mathbf{z}^* - F(\mathbf{z}^*;\mathbf{u},\theta_a)\|^2\bigr].$$  
    – We also leverage known physical priors (e.g., energy conservation) by constraining $W_a$ to satisfy symmetry or positive‐definiteness when appropriate.  

  • Training Procedure  
    1. Initialize $\theta$ (digital and analog parameters) with standard schemes (Xavier for digital, small random for analog).  
    2. For each minibatch:  
       a. Forward: compute $\mathbf{u}=U_{\theta_u}(\mathbf{x})$. Run proxy iteration for $T_{\mathrm{train}}$ steps to approximate $\mathbf{z}^*$.  
       b. Compute loss $\ell$ plus regularization $R(\theta)$.  
       c. Backward: compute gradients via implicit differentiation.  
       d. Update $\theta$ with AdamW, scheduling learning rates to account for analog parameter sensitivity.  
    3. Periodically fine‐tune on a hardware‐in‐the‐loop setup: load learned $W_a,U_a$ onto the real analog device, collect actual equilibrium states, and perform corrective digital fine‐tuning to compensate residual mismatch.

By grounding DEQ architectures in physics and embedding hardware imperfections within the training loop, we aim to unlock energy-efficient, low-latency inference and training at scales unreachable by digital electronics alone. The anticipated deliverables—a robust hybrid DEQ framework, validated across tasks and hardware, together with a shared software and hardware interface—will lay the foundation for next-generation analog-ML co-design and breathe new life into equilibrium-based learning modalities.
