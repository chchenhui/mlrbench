**Title:** Noise-Aware Analog Backpropagation for Energy-Efficient Training

**Motivation:** Training deep learning models is computationally expensive. Analog hardware promises significant energy savings but suffers from inherent noise and device mismatch, making direct application of standard training algorithms like backpropagation challenging and often inaccurate. This research aims to make analog training feasible by adapting algorithms to harness, rather than fight, hardware imperfections.

**Main Idea:** We propose developing a "Noise-Aware Backpropagation" (NAB) algorithm specifically for analog hardware. NAB will explicitly model the forward and backward pass noise characteristics of the analog substrate during training. Instead of requiring high-precision components, NAB will incorporate learned or measured noise distributions directly into the gradient calculations, potentially treating noise as implicit regularization. We hypothesize that by adapting the learning updates based on the hardware's stochastic behavior, NAB can achieve comparable convergence to digital training but with significantly lower energy consumption. Expected outcomes include robust training protocols for analog systems and guidelines for co-designing hardware with awareness of algorithmic noise tolerance.
