**Title:** Co-Designing Analog Stochastic Hardware with Energy-Based Models for Efficient Sampling  

**Motivation:** Energy-based models (EBMs) offer powerful generative and discriminative capabilities but suffer from inefficient sampling due to reliance on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which demand high computational resources. Emerging analog hardware platforms inherently exhibit stochasticity and device variability—traits traditionally seen as drawbacks—but these could be harnessed to accelerate EBM sampling while reducing energy consumption.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a co-design framework where analog hardware’s natural noise and device mismatch are exploited as computational resources for EBM training and sampling. The hardware would implement stochastic neurons with analog circuits that natively perform Gibbs sampling, leveraging thermal noise for proposal generation. On the algorithm side, a hybrid training loop would combine gradient-based updates (via digital processing) with analog hardware-in-the-loop sampling, adapting model parameters to the specific noise profile of the physical system. Crucially, the analog-digital interface would be optimized to compensate for limited bit-depth and operational constraints. Expected outcomes include a 10-100x reduction in sampling latency/energy compared to GPU-based MCMC and robust EBMs tolerant to hardware imperfections. If successful, this could enable sustainable deployment of EBMs in edge devices and advance applications like anomaly detection or physics-informed generative modeling.
