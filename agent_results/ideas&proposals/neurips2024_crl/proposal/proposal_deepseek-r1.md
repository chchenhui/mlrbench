**Causal Diffusion Models: Disentangling Latent Causal Factors in Generative AI**

### 2. Introduction  

#### Background  
Generative AI models, particularly diffusion-based architectures, have revolutionized data synthesis by capturing complex high-dimensional distributions. However, their reliance on statistical correlations—rather than causal relationships—introduces risks of spurious associations and algorithmic bias. For instance, in medical imaging, a diffusion model might erroneously link non-causal features (e.g., scanner artifacts) to disease labels, compromising reliability. Traditional causal discovery methods, while effective in low-dimensional settings, struggle with latent causal reasoning in unstructured data like images or text.  

Causal representation learning (CRL) bridges this gap by identifying latent causal variables and their structural relationships. Recent works, such as DeCaFlow and C2VAE, integrate causal graphs into generative models but face challenges in scalability, handling hidden confounders, and ensuring interpretability. This proposal addresses these gaps by unifying diffusion models with CRL, enabling *causally grounded generation*.

#### Research Objectives  
1. Develop **Causal Diffusion Models (CDMs)** that embed causal graph structures into diffusion processes to disentangle latent factors.  
2. Design a joint optimization framework for causal discovery and data generation, leveraging interventional data or domain constraints.  
3. Validate CDMs on synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., biomedical improved controll improved controllability and robustness.  
4. Establish metrics for evaluating causal disentanglement and counterfactual fidelity in generative tasks.  

#### Significance  
CDMs aim to enhance the trustworthiness of generative AI by:  
- Enabling precise control over causally relevant features (e.g., disease markers in X-rays).  
- Reducing sensitivity to confounders and distribution shifts.  
- Providing interpretable latent representations for hypothesis testing in scientific domains.  
This work aligns with the CRL community’s goals of advancing causal generative models and benchmarking frameworks.

### 3. Methodology  

#### Research Design  
CDMs combine a diffusion backbone with a causal discovery module (Fig. 1). The model jointly optimizes:  
1. **Data reconstruction** via denoising diffusion.  
2. **Causal disentanglement** through latent graph inference.  

**Architecture**  
- **Diffusion Backbone**: A time-conditional U-Net trained to iteratively denoise data $x_t$ at timestep $t$.  
- **Causal Encoder**: Maps noisy input $x_t$ to latent variables $z_t = [z_{t,1}, ..., z_{t,k}]$, each representing a causal factor.  
- **Causal Discovery Module**: Infers a directed acyclic graph (DAG) $A \in \{0,1\}^{k \times k}$ over $z_t$ using a differentiable score-based approach.  

#### Algorithmic Steps  
1. **Forward Diffusion**: Corrupt input $x_0$ over $T$ steps using a variance schedule $\beta_t$:  
   $$q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t I).$$  
2. **Causal Encoding**: At each timestep $t$, encode $x_t$ into latent variables $z_t = E_\theta(x_t, t)$.  
3. **Graph Inference**: Compute adjacency matrix $A$ via NOTEARS-inspired optimization:  
   $$\min_A \mathcal{L}_{\text{DAG}} = \text{tr}(e^{A \circ A}) - k + \lambda \|A\|_1,$$  
   where $\circ$ denotes Hadamard product and $\lambda$ enforces sparsity.  
4. **Causal Denoising**: For each denoising step, model the conditional distribution $p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t, A)$ using a structural equation model (SEM):  
   $$z_{t-1} = A^T z_t + \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I),$$  
   followed by decoding $x_{t-1} = D_\phi(z_{t-1})$.  
5. **Loss Function**: Combine diffusion and causal terms:  
   $$\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{t,x_0,\epsilon} \left[ \|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, A)\|^2 \right] + \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{DAG}},$$  
   where $\alpha$ balances reconstruction and causal fidelity.  

#### Data Collection  
- **Synthetic Data**: Generate images with known causal graphs (e.g., objects with controllable attributes like shape/color).  
- **Real-World Data**: Use biomedical imaging datasets (e.g., BraTS for brain tumors) with expert-annotated causal features.  
- **Interventional Data**: Augment datasets with perturbations (e.g., synthetic lesions in MRI scans) to train the causal module.  

#### Experimental Design  
1. **Baselines**: Compare against DeCaFlow, CausalBGM, C2VAE, and vanilla diffusion models.  
2. **Metrics**:  
   - **Counterfactual Editing Accuracy**: Measure how often editing a latent variable $z_i$ induces correct changes in outputs.  
   - **Disentanglement Score**: Use Mutual Information Gap (MIG) to quantify variable separability.  
   - **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**: Assess generation quality.  
   - **Robustness**: Test performance under distribution shifts (e.g., unseen confounders).  
3. **Ablation Studies**: Validate the necessity of each component (e.g., causal loss, graph constraints).

### 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

#### Expected Outcomes  
1. **Theoretical Contributions**:  
   - A framework for integrating causal graphs into diffusion models.  
   - Bounds on identifiability of latent variables under partial observability.  
2. **Empirical Results**:  
   - Improved counterfactual editing accuracy (>20% over baselines) and disentanglement scores.  
   - Reduced FID scores under confounded settings, demonstrating robustness.  
3. **Benchmarking**: Publicly release synthetic datasets and evaluation protocols for CRL in generative tasks.  

#### Impact  
CDMs will advance multiple domains:  
- **Healthcare**: Enable interpretable synthesis of medical images for training diagnostic models without privacy risks.  
- **AI Safety**: Mitigate spurious correlations in generative models used for decision support.  
- **Scientific Discovery**: Facilitate causal hypothesis testing by generating counterfactual scenarios (e.g., "What if a tumor had a different shape?").  
- **Industry**: Provide tools for controllable content generation in advertising, robotics, and autonomous systems.  

By addressing key challenges in CRL—such as hidden confounders and scalability—this work will lay the foundation for a new generation of trustworthy, causally aware AI systems.
