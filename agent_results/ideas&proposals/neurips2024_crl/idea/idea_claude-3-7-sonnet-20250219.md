# Causal Representation Learning for Robust Visual Understanding in Dynamic Environments

## Motivation
Current deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but struggle with understanding causality in visual data, especially in dynamic environments where spurious correlations can lead to catastrophic failures. When lighting conditions, backgrounds, or viewpoints change, models often make incorrect predictions because they rely on correlations rather than causal relationships. This limitation hinders deployment in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving or medical diagnosis, where robust understanding of visual causality is essential for reliable decision-making.

## Main Idea
We propose a framework that integrates causal discovery with representation learning for visual data through a two-phase approach. First, we develop a causal structure learning mechanism that identifies latent causal variables in visual scenes using controlled interventions in simulated environments. This allows us to learn which visual elements causally influence outcomes rather than merely correlate with them. Second, we design a disentangled representation architecture that explicitly separates causal from non-causal features, maintaining invariant causal relationships while adapting to distribution shifts. The framework introduces a novel "causal consistency loss" that penalizes representations that violate identified causal structures across environments. We will evaluate our approach on both synthetic datasets with known causal ground truth and real-world vision tasks with distribution shifts, expecting significant improvements in out-of-distribution generalization compared to conventional methods.
