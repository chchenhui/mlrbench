**Title:** Causal Structure-Informed Fine-tuning for Large Language Models

**Motivation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively capture correlations from vast text data but often fail at causal reasoning, leading to spurious associations and unreliable predictions in scenarios requiring understanding of cause-effect relationships (e.g., medical diagnosis, policy making). Fine-tuning LLMs specifically for causal understanding is crucial for improving their reliability and applicability in critical domains.

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a novel fine-tuning methodology for LLMs that explicitly incorporates causal knowledge. We will leverage existing causal graphs from specific domains (e.g., biology, economics) or infer potential causal variables and relationships from text using targeted CRL techniques. The LLM will be fine-tuned on tasks designed to probe causal understanding, such as: 1) Predicting the effect of an intervention described in text. 2) Generating valid counterfactual statements. 3) Identifying causal fallacies in arguments. The fine-tuning loss function will be augmented with terms that penalize outputs inconsistent with the provided or inferred causal structure. We expect this Causal Structure-Informed Fine-tuning (CSI-FT) approach to significantly enhance LLM performance on causal reasoning benchmarks and improve robustness against confounders compared to standard fine-tuning.
