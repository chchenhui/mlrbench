1. **Title**: DeCaFlow: A Deconfounding Causal Generative Model (arXiv:2503.15114)
   - **Authors**: Alejandro Almodóvar, Adrián Javaloy, Juan Parras, Santiago Zazo, Isabel Valera
   - **Summary**: DeCaFlow introduces a causal generative model that accounts for hidden confounders using only observational data and the causal graph. It identifies all causal queries with a valid adjustment set or sufficiently informative proxy variables, demonstrating flexibility and improved performance over existing approaches.

2. **Title**: An AI-powered Bayesian generative modeling approach for causal inference in observational studies (arXiv:2501.00755)
   - **Authors**: Qiao Liu, Wing Hung Wong
   - **Summary**: CausalBGM is a Bayesian generative model that estimates individual treatment effects by learning distributions of latent features driving changes in treatment and outcome. It effectively mitigates confounding effects and provides comprehensive uncertainty quantification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in high-dimensional settings.

   - **Authors**: Qilong Zhao, Shiyu Wang, Guangji Bai, Bo Pan, Zhaohui Qin, Liang Zhao
   - **Summary**: The Correlation-aware Causal Variational Auto-encoder (C2VAE) framework recovers correlation and causal relationships between properties using disentangled latent vectors. It captures causality through a structural causal model and learns correlation via a novel pooling algorithm, enabling controllable data generation.

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Identifying Latent Causal Variables**: Accurately discovering and disentangling latent variables that represent true causal factors remains complex, especially in high-dimensional data.

2. **Handling Hidden Confounders**: Effectively accounting for unobserved confounders is crucial to avoid biased causal inferences and ensure model reliability.

3. **Ensuring Model Interpretability**: Developing models that provide clear and interpretable causal relationships is essential for trustworthiness, particularly in sensitive applications like healthcare.

4. **Robustness to Distribution Shifts**: Causal generative models must maintain performance when applied to data with distribution shifts, ensuring generalizability across different contexts.

5. **Efficient Training and Scalability**: Balancing computational efficiency with the complexity of causal modeling is necessary to make these models practical for large-scale applications.
