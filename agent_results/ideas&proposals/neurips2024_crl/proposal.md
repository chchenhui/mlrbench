### Title: Causal Diffusion Models: Disentangling Latent Causal Factors in Generative AI

### Introduction

#### Background
Generative models, such as diffusion networks, have achieved remarkable success in capturing data distributions and generating coherent outputs. However, these models often learn spurious correlations due to their reliance on non-causal associations, which can undermine their trustworthiness, particularly in sensitive applications like healthcare. Traditional causal discovery methods, while effective for fully observed data, struggle to handle complex real-world situations where causal effects occur in latent spaces, especially with images, videos, and text data.

#### Research Objectives
The primary objective of this research is to develop a novel framework, termed Causal Diffusion Models (CDMs), that integrates causal representation learning (CRL) with generative models to address the limitations of current approaches. Specifically, CDMs aim to:
1. Embed a causal graph structure into the latent space of diffusion models.
2. Jointly optimize for data reconstruction and causal disentanglement.
3. Enable generation guided by causal factors, improving control over outputs and reducing sensitivity to confounding features.

#### Significance
The proposed research has significant implications for enhancing the interpretability, reliability, and trustworthiness of generative models. By disentangling latent causal factors, CDMs can facilitate more interpretable and bias-resistant synthesis, aiding in causal hypothesis testing and sensitive applications such as biomedical imaging. Additionally, the proposed framework addresses key challenges in CRL, including identifying latent causal variables, handling hidden confounders, ensuring model interpretability, and maintaining robustness to distribution shifts.

### Methodology

#### Research Design
The proposed research involves the development and evaluation of Causal Diffusion Models (CDMs). The methodology can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Causal Discovery Module**:
    - **Objective**: Infer directional relationships among latent variables.
    - **Approach**: Utilize constrained optimization or score-based methods to identify causal dependencies. This can be augmented with interventional data (if available) or domain constraints.
    - **Mathematical Formulation**:
      \[
      \hat{\mathcal{G}} = \arg \max_{\mathcal{G}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{D}, \mathcal{C})
      \]
      where $\hat{\mathcal{G}}$ is the estimated causal graph, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}$ is the causal discovery loss, $\mathcal{D}$ is the observed data, and $\mathcal{C}$ is the domain constraints or interventional data.

2. **Diffusion Process Incorporation**:
    - **Objective**: Align each denoising step with the inferred causal graph.
    - **Approach**: Modify the diffusion process to incorporate the causal dependencies inferred by the discovery module. This ensures that the generative process respects the causal structure.
    - **Mathematical Formulation**:
      \[
      \hat{x}_{t} = \mathcal{D}_{\theta}(x_{t-1}, \mathcal{G}, \epsilon_{t})
      \]
      where $\hat{x}_{t}$ is the denoised latent variable at time step $t$, $\mathcal{D}_{\theta}$ is the denoising function parameterized by $\theta$, $\mathcal{G}$ is the inferred causal graph, and $\epsilon_{t}$ is the noise at time step $t$.

3. **Joint Optimization**:
    - **Objective**: Optimize for both data reconstruction and causal disentanglement.
    - **Approach**: Employ a joint loss function that combines the reconstruction loss and the causal discovery loss.
    - **Mathematical Formulation**:
      \[
      \theta^* = \arg \min_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}}(\theta) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}}(\theta) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}(\theta, \mathcal{G})
      \]
      where $\theta^*$ is the optimized parameters, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}}$ is the total loss, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}}$ is the reconstruction loss, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}$ is the causal discovery loss, and $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter balancing the two components.

#### Experimental Design
To validate the method, we will conduct experiments on diverse datasets, including biomedical imaging data, synthetic datasets with known causal structures, and text data. The evaluation metrics will include:

1. **Reconstruction Quality**: Measure the fidelity of the generated samples to the original data using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM).
2. **Causal Disentanglement**: Evaluate the ability of the model to disentangle and respect the causal relationships using metrics like mutual information (MI) between latent variables and causal variables.
3. **Counterfactual Editing**: Assess the model’s ability to generate counterfactual scenarios by varying causal factors while keeping other features fixed, using metrics like the difference in generation quality.

### Expected Outcomes & Impact

#### Expected Outcomes
1. **Development of Causal Diffusion Models (CDMs)**: A novel framework that integrates causal representation learning with generative models.

3. **Quantifiable Counterfactual Editing**: Metrics to quantify the model’s ability to generate counterfactual scenarios, aiding in causal hypothesis testing.
4. **Reduced Sensitivity to Confounding Features**: Improved robustness to confounding features by disentangling latent causal variables.
5. **Practical Applications**: Demonstrations of CDMs in sensitive applications, such as biomedical imaging, where causal understanding is crucial.

#### Impact
The development of Causal Diffusion Models (CDMs) has the potential to revolutionize the field of generative AI by addressing the limitations of current approaches. By enhancing the interpretability, reliability, and trustworthiness of generative models, CDMs can facilitate more effective and responsible use in sensitive applications.
