# Cross-Modal Watermarking for Trustworthy AI-Generated Content (TAGC)

## Motivation
As multi-modal foundation models and AI agents become more powerful in generating highly realistic content across different modalities, distinguishing AI-generated from human-created material becomes increasingly challenging. This raises serious concerns about misinformation, deep fakes, and copyright issues. Current watermarking approaches primarily focus on single modalities and often fail when content is transformed or transferred between modalities. There is an urgent need for resilient cross-modal watermarking techniques that can authenticate AI-generated content across multiple modalities, enabling transparency and accountability in the AI ecosystem.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel cross-modal watermarking framework that embeds synchronized, imperceptible signatures across text, image, audio, and video outputs from multi-modal foundation models. Our approach uses frequency domain transformations to embed watermarks that remain detectable even when content is converted between modalities (e.g., text-to-speech, image-to-text descriptions). The framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) modal-invariant watermark encoding that preserves signature information across modality transformations, (2) hierarchical watermarking patterns that provide both origin identification and content verification, and (3) a self-supervised learning mechanism that optimizes watermark robustness against common manipulations while maintaining content quality. This system would empower content platforms to automatically verify TAGC, helping users distinguish between human and AI-created materials while respecting creator rights and combating misinformation.
