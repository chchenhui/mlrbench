# Latent Space-Driven Cross-Modal Watermarking Framework for Robust Attribution and Provenance in Multi-Modal Generative Models

## 1. Introduction  
### Background  
Multi-modal Generative Models (MMGMs) such as Sora, Stable Diffusion, and Latte have revolutionized content creation by synthesizing high-fidelity text, images, video, and audio. However, their widespread adoption raises critical challenges in misinformation mitigation, copyright enforcement, and accountability. Existing watermarking techniques—while effective in single-modality scenarios (e.g., *InvisMark* for images)—struggle with **cross-modal consistency** (e.g., ensuring a latent watermark in text input propagates to generated video) and **robustness** against post-processing like compression or cropping (*Zhengyuan Jiang et al., 2023*). Furthermore, theoretical limitations (*Hanlin Zhang et al., 2023*) suggest adversarial attacks can circumvent current methods, necessitating fundamentally new approaches.  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a **unified watermarking framework** for MMGMs that addresses three critical gaps:  
1. **Cross-Modal Traceability**: Embedding watermarks in latent representations to ensure detection across all modalities (e.g., text-to-video).  
2. **Robustness**: Resilience to post-processing and adversarial tampering.  
3. **Scalable Provenance**: Linking generated content to model versions, sessions, or users via cryptographically secure identifiers.  

### Significance  
By embedding watermarks at the latent space level, our framework will enable reliable **provenance tracing** (e.g., identifying whether a viral video was generated by a specific MMGM) and **attribution** (e.g., tracing a user who generated disinformation). This work directly addresses emergent challenges listed under TiFA, including "identifiers of AI-generated material" and "technical alignment for accountability."

## 2. Methodology  
### 2.1 Research Design  
#### Data Collection & Preprocessing  
- **Source Datasets**: Use multi-modal datasets (e.g., LAION-5B for text-image pairs, AudioSet for audio-video) and synthetic data generated from open-source MMGMs (Stable Diffusion 3, Sora replications).  
- **Post-Processing Simulation**: Apply common manipulations (JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, resizing, audio re-encoding) to generated content for robustness testing.  
- **Adversarial Attack Simulation**: Implement evasion attacks (*Zhengyuan Jiang et al., 2023*) and watermark removal techniques to stress-test the framework.  

#### Watermark Embedding Architecture  
1. **Latent Space Encoder**:  
   - For an input prompt $p$ (text, image, etc.), the MMGM’s encoder produces a latent representation $\mathbf{z}$.  
   - A **watermark injector** module $E_{\theta}$ appends a binary identifier $\mathbf{w} \in \{0,1\}^n$ (derived from model version and session context) to $\mathbf{z}$, outputting $\mathbf{z}' = \text{Concat}(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{w})$.  
   - To ensure imperceptibility, the watermarking process minimizes distortion using a perceptual loss:  
     $$
     L_{\text{perceptual}} = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{w}} \left[ \|\mathbf{z} - \mathbf{z}'\|_2^2 \right].
     $$  

2. **Cross-Modal Fusion Network**:  
   - A transformer-based fusion layer aligns $\mathbf{z}'$ with target modality representations (e.g., video frames, audio spectrograms).  
   - Multi-head cross-attention ensures the watermark propagates across modalities:  
     $$
     \mathbf{h}_\text{fused} = \text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{z}', \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{y}_{\text{target}}),
     $$  
     where $\mathbf{y}_{\text{target}}$ is the target modality’s latent space.  

3. **Robust Decoder**:  
   - A diffusion-based decoder generates output $\mathbf{x}$ (image, video, etc.) from $\mathbf{h}_\text{fused}$, retaining $\mathbf{w}$ in its latent structure.  

#### Watermark Extraction Pipeline  
1. **Multi-Modal Detector**:  
   - A convolutional-transformer network processes input $\mathbf{x}$ to reconstruct $\mathbf{w}$:  
     $$
     \hat{\mathbf{w}} = \text{Detector}_{\phi}(\mathbf{x}).
     $$  
   - Training optimizes bit accuracy via cross-entropy:  
     $$
     L_{\text{detect}} = -\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{w}_i \log \hat{\mathbf{w}}_i.
     $$  

2. **Adversarial Defense**:  
   - Train the detector using adversarial examples generated via Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to resist evasion attacks.  

#### Training Strategy  
- Jointly optimize the watermark injector $E_{\theta}$ and detector using a multi-task loss:  
  $$
  L_{\text{total}} = \lambda_1 L_{\text{perceptual}} + \lambda_2 L_{\text{detect}} + \lambda_3 L_{\text{adv}},
  $$  
  where $L_{\text{adv}}$ penalizes detector failures on perturbed inputs.  

### 2.2 Experimental Validation  
#### Evaluation Metrics  
1. **Imperceptibility**:  
   - Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between watermarked and non-watermarked outputs.  
2. **Robustness**:  
   - Bit accuracy (%) of $\hat{\mathbf{w}}$ after post-processing (compression, cropping).  
   - Tamper localization accuracy (IoU) for partial content manipulation.  
3. **Security**:  
   - Success rate of adversarial attacks in removing/altering $\hat{\mathbf{w}}$.  

#### Baseline Comparisons  
- Compare against state-of-the-art methods: *InvisMark* (image watermarking), *GenPTW* (in-generation tracing), and *VLPMarker* (multi-modal embedding).  

#### Ablation Studies  
- Test contributions of individual components (e.g., fusion network, adversarial training).

By embedding watermarks in the latent space and ensuring cross-modal consistency, this work will advance the trustworthiness of MMGMs while directly confronting challenges outlined in recent literature—from adversarial robustness (*Jiang et al., 2023*) to scalability (*Fernandez, 2025*). The proposed framework lays a foundation for ethical AI deployment in an era of democratized content generation.
