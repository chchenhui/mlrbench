**Title:** Dynamic Resource-Aware Adaptive Data Preprocessing for Scalable Neural Network Training  

**Motivation:** Data preprocessing and loading are critical yet often overlooked bottlenecks in large-scale model training. Current static pipelines fail to adapt to varying computational resource availability (e.g., CPU-GPU utilization imbalance), leading to idle hardware and prolonged training times. Optimizing this process is vital for democratizing efficient training across diverse hardware setups, from industrial clusters to resource-constrained research teams.  

**Main Idea:** This work proposes a dynamic, resource-aware data preprocessing system that optimizes I/O, decompression, and transformation tasks by leveraging real-time hardware telemetry. The system employs a lightweight scheduler trained via reinforcement learning to allocate preprocessing stages (e.g., image augmentation, tokenization) to CPU/GPU resources based on current utilization, memory constraints, and storage bandwidth. It integrates adaptive data compression (e.g., learned codecs for faster decoding) and prioritized prefetching based on predicted batch requirements. By decoupling preprocessing from model execution and dynamically balancing workloads, the system reduces data loading latency by 30â€“50% in preliminary simulations. Expected outcomes include open-source benchmarks for data pipeline efficiency and a plug-and-play library compatible with PyTorch/TensorFlow, enabling seamless adoption. This directly addresses scalability challenges for large models and lowers barriers for under-resourced teams.
