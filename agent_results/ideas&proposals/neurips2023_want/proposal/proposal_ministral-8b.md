### Mathematical Formulas

The following mathematical formulas represent the key components of the proposed system:

1. **Resource Utilization Metrics**: The resource utilization metrics can be represented as follows:

   \[
   \text{CPU Utilization} = \frac{\text{CPU Time}}{\text{Total CPU Time}}
   \]

   \[
   \text{GPU Utilization} = \frac{\text{GPU Time}}{\text{Total GPU Time}}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Memory Usage} = \frac{\text{Current Memory}}{\text{Total Memory}}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Storage Bandwidth} = \frac{\text{Data Transferred}}{\text{Total Data}}
   \]

2. **Scheduler Training**: The reinforcement learning scheduler can be trained using the following objective function:

   \[
   \text{Objective} = \max_{a} \sum_{t} \gamma^t r_t(a_t)
   \]

   where \( a_t \) represents the action taken by the scheduler at time \( t \), \( r_t(a_t) \) is the reward obtained from taking action \( a_t \), and \( \gamma \) is the discount factor.

3. **Adaptive Data Compression**: The adaptive data compression techniques can be represented as follows:

   \[
   \text{Compressed Data} = \text{Original Data} \times \text{Compression Ratio}
   \]

   where the compression ratio is determined based on the predicted batch requirements and the current state of the hardware resources.

4. **Prioritized Prefetching**: The prioritized prefetching mechanism can be represented as follows:

   \[
   \text{Prefetching Priority} = f(\text{Current Batch Requirements}, \text{Hardware Resource State})
   \]

   where \( f \) is a function that determines the prefetching priority based on the current batch requirements and the state of the hardware resources.
