**1. Title:** **DRAPPS: Dynamic Resource-Aware Adaptive Preprocessing System for Efficient and Scalable Neural Network Training**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is undergoing a revolution, driven by the unprecedented scale of data, computational power, and algorithmic advancements. Models like Transformers, Large Language Models (LLMs), and diffusion models have enabled transformative applications ranging from conversational AI (e.g., ChatGPT) and generative art to breakthroughs in scientific discovery (AI for Science). However, this progress comes at the cost of exponentially increasing model size and training complexity. Training these state-of-the-art models demands vast computational resources and significant time, often spanning weeks or months on large-scale hardware clusters. This escalating scale poses a significant bottleneck, hindering progress not only for large industrial labs but especially for smaller academic research teams and organizations with limited resources. Optimizing every stage of the training pipeline is crucial to sustain innovation, democratize access to cutting-edge AI, and foster applications in critical domains like healthcare, climate science, and finance, aligning with the goals of the Workshop on Advancing Neural Network Training (WANT).

A critical, yet often underestimated, component of the training pipeline is data loading and preprocessing. This stage involves fetching data from storage, decompressing it, applying necessary transformations (e.g., image augmentations, text tokenization), and batching it for consumption by the GPU accelerators. In large-scale distributed training scenarios, the data pipeline can easily become the bottleneck, leading to GPU starvation â€“ where expensive accelerators sit idle waiting for data. Current data pipelines are typically static; the allocation of preprocessing tasks (e.g., primarily on CPU) and the pipeline configuration (e.g., number of worker processes, prefetch buffer size) are fixed before training begins. This static approach fails to adapt to the dynamic nature of system resources during a long training run. Fluctuations in CPU load, I/O bandwidth contention, varying complexity of data samples, and communication overhead in distributed settings can lead to significant imbalances and inefficiencies. For instance, CPUs might become overloaded with complex augmentations while GPUs are underutilized, or vice-versa if preprocessing is offloaded naively to the GPU without considering its primary training workload. This manifests as suboptimal resource utilization, extended training times, increased energy consumption, and higher operational costs.

**2.2 Problem Statement**
The rigidity of current data preprocessing pipelines constitutes a major impediment to achieving optimal computational efficiency, scalability, and resource utilization in neural network training. Static configurations cannot dynamically respond to real-time variations in system load (CPU, GPU, memory, I/O, network), leading to bottlenecks that throttle overall training throughput. This inefficiency disproportionately affects researchers and practitioners with limited computational budgets, hindering their ability to train large models or iterate quickly. There is a pressing need for intelligent, adaptive data preprocessing systems that can monitor resource availability and dynamically orchestrate data loading and transformation tasks to maximize hardware utilization and minimize data access latency.

**2.3 Proposed Solution**
This research proposes the development of a **Dynamic Resource-Aware Adaptive Preprocessing System (DRAPPS)**. DRAPPS aims to optimize the data input pipeline by dynamically managing and allocating preprocessing tasks across available compute resources (CPU, potentially GPU) based on real-time system telemetry. The core of DRAPPS is a lightweight scheduler, potentially trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), that continuously monitors resource utilization (CPU load, GPU compute/memory usage, memory bandwidth, storage I/O, network traffic) and pipeline performance metrics (data loading latency, queue lengths). Based on this state, the scheduler makes decisions on:
    *   **Task Allocation:** Dynamically routing specific preprocessing operations (e.g., decompression, augmentation variants, tokenization) to either CPU cores or, where beneficial and feasible, GPU compute units.
    *   **Adaptive Compression:** Selecting optimal data compression techniques (including potentially learned, lightweight codecs or standard codecs like LZ4, Zstd) based on current I/O bottlenecks and decoding costs, adapting the trade-off between storage size/bandwidth and decompression speed.
    *   **Prioritized Prefetching:** Adjusting the depth and priority of data prefetching based on predicted model consumption rates and observed pipeline latency, ensuring data is ready just-in-time.
    *   **Worker Management:** Dynamically adjusting the number of active preprocessing worker processes or threads.

By decoupling data preprocessing from the main training loop and enabling intelligent, adaptive scheduling, DRAPPS aims to significantly reduce data bottlenecks, improve hardware utilization, and accelerate overall training time.

**2.4 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:
    1.  **Design and Develop DRAPPS:** Create the system architecture for DRAPPS, including modules for resource monitoring, dynamic scheduling, adaptive task execution (on CPU/GPU), adaptive compression/decompression, and prioritized prefetching.
    2.  **Implement an RL-based Scheduler:** Formulate the dynamic scheduling problem as an RL task. Develop and train an RL agent (e.g., using Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO or Soft Actor-Critic - SAC) to learn an optimal scheduling policy based on minimizing latency and maximizing resource utilization. Compare RL against heuristic-based dynamic schedulers.
    3.  **Integrate Adaptive Techniques:** Incorporate mechanisms for adaptive compression codec selection (based on data characteristics and resource state) and dynamic prefetching strategies (potentially learning-based predictors for batch loading times).
    4.  **Systematic Evaluation:** Rigorously evaluate DRAPPS performance against state-of-the-art static data loading pipelines (e.g., standard PyTorch/TensorFlow DataLoader) across diverse datasets (e.g., ImageNet, large text corpora like C4/Pile), models (e.g., ResNet, Vision Transformer, BERT), and hardware configurations (single-node multi-GPU, simulated distributed environments).
    5.  **Develop an Open-Source Library:** Package DRAPPS into a user-friendly, plug-and-play library compatible with major deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) to facilitate adoption by the research community.

**2.5 Significance**
This research directly addresses critical challenges highlighted by the WANT workshop: computational efficiency, scalability, and resource optimization in neural network training. By tackling the data pipeline bottleneck, DRAPPS offers several significant contributions:
    *   **Accelerated Training:** Reducing data loading latency directly translates to faster end-to-end training times, enabling quicker research iterations and model deployment.
    *   **Improved Resource Utilization:** Dynamically balancing workloads across CPU and GPU resources minimizes hardware idle time, leading to more cost-effective training and potentially lower energy consumption.
    *   **Enhanced Scalability:** An efficient data pipeline is fundamental for scaling training to larger datasets and models, particularly in distributed settings where data movement is complex.
    *   **Democratization:** By improving efficiency, DRAPPS lowers the resource barrier for training large models, making advanced AI more accessible to researchers and institutions with limited budgets.
    *   **Scientific Contribution:** This work advances the state-of-the-art in data loading systems for deep learning, exploring the novel application of RL for dynamic resource-aware scheduling in this context and providing benchmarks for data pipeline efficiency.
    *   **Practical Tooling:** The proposed open-source library will provide a tangible tool for the AI, HPC, and scientific computing communities.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 System Architecture**
DRAPPS will be designed as a modular system, intended to replace or augment standard data loaders in frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. Its key components include:

1.  **Resource Monitor:** Continuously collects real-time telemetry from the system, including:
    *   CPU utilization (per core/overall).
    *   GPU utilization (compute, memory usage, memory bandwidth).
    *   System memory usage and bandwidth.
    *   Storage I/O rates and latency.
    *   Network bandwidth and latency (in distributed settings).
    *   Internal pipeline metrics (e.g., queue lengths for different preprocessing stages, batch loading latency).
    *   Hardware monitoring tools (e.g., `nvml`, `psutil`, `iostat`) will be leveraged.

2.  **Dynamic Scheduler (RL Agent):** The core decision-making component. Receives state information from the Resource Monitor and decides on actions to optimize the data pipeline.
    *   Input: System state vector $s_t$.
    *   Output: Action vector $a_t$ (e.g., task assignments, compression choice, prefetch depth).
    *   Policy: $\pi(a_t | s_t)$, learned via RL.

3.  **Preprocessing Task Dispatcher:** Receives tasks (e.g., load sample, decompress, augment) and routes them to appropriate workers based on the Scheduler's decisions.

4.  **CPU Worker Pool:** A pool of processes or threads executing preprocessing tasks assigned to the CPU. The number of active workers can be dynamically adjusted by the Scheduler.

5.  **GPU Worker Stream(s) (Optional):** Dedicated CUDA streams for executing preprocessing tasks offloaded to the GPU (e.g., certain augmentations using libraries like NVIDIA DALI or custom kernels). Allocation managed by the Scheduler.

6.  **Adaptive Compression Module:** Handles compression of raw data (if applicable for caching/storage) and decompression during loading. Can select different algorithms (e.g., Zstd, LZ4, Snappy, potentially lightweight learned codecs) based on Scheduler commands, balancing compression ratio, CPU cost, and speed.

7.  **Prioritized Prefetcher:** Manages fetching raw data from storage and buffering intermediate results. Adjusts prefetch depth and prioritizes samples based on Scheduler guidance and potentially predicted near-term data needs.

8.  **Data Batcher:** Assembles preprocessed samples into batches ready for model consumption.

**3.2 Data Collection (for System Operation and RL Training)**
*   **Real-time Telemetry:** The Resource Monitor will sample hardware and pipeline metrics at a configurable frequency (e.g., every 100ms - 1s).
*   **Training Data for RL:**
    *   **Simulation:** An initial simulator of the data pipeline will be built. This allows for rapid prototyping and pre-training of the RL agent in a controlled environment where resource contention, task durations, and I/O speeds can be modeled and varied. The simulator will generate state transitions and reward signals based on simulated task completions and resource usage.
    *   **Real-world Traces:** Data collected from actual training runs using static pipelines or early versions of DRAPPS will be used for offline RL training or fine-tuning the agent trained in simulation. This includes logs of resource usage, task completion times, and achieved throughput/latency.

**3.3 Core Algorithm: RL-based Dynamic Scheduler**

*   **Problem Formulation (Markov Decision Process - MDP):**
    *   **State ($s_t$):** A vector representing the system's condition at time $t$. It will include:
        *   Normalized CPU utilization (e.g., moving average).
        *   Normalized GPU utilization (compute, memory).
        *   Available system memory.
        *   Storage I/O wait time / throughput.
        *   Network bandwidth usage (if distributed).
        *   Length of queues for different preprocessing stages (e.g., raw data queue, augmented data queue, batch queue).
        *   Recent average batch loading latency.
        *   Recent average GPU idle time (waiting for data).
        *   Characteristics of upcoming data (e.g., estimated processing complexity if available).
    *   **Action ($a_t$):** A vector of decisions made by the scheduler. This could be a hybrid discrete/continuous action space:
        *   *Task Assignment:* For a given task type (e.g., augmentation A), assign to CPU or GPU. (Discrete)
        *   *Worker Adjustment:* Increase/decrease number of active CPU workers. (Discrete/Continuous)
        *   *Compression Selection:* Choose codec {None, LZ4, Zstd, LearnedCodec}. (Discrete)
        *   *Prefetch Depth:* Set target prefetch buffer size (e.g., number of batches). (Continuous/Discrete)
        *   *GPU Offload Ratio:* Proportion of eligible tasks to offload to GPU. (Continuous)
    *   **Reward ($r_t$):** A scalar value indicating the quality of the action taken in state $s_t$. The goal is to maximize cumulative reward. A potential reward function could be:
        $$
        r_t = w_{tp} \cdot \text{Throughput}_t - w_{lat} \cdot \text{Latency}_t - w_{idle} \cdot \text{GPU_IdleTime}_t - w_{imb} \cdot \text{ResourceImbalance}_t
        $$
        where:
        *   $\text{Throughput}_t$ is the rate of sample processing (samples/sec).
        *   $\text{Latency}_t$ is the batch loading latency.
        *   $\text{GPU_IdleTime}_t$ is the time the GPU spent waiting for data.
        *   $\text{ResourceImbalance}_t$ is a measure of uneven load across CPU/GPU (e.g., variance in utilization).
        *   $w_*$ are weighting factors, tuned to prioritize specific objectives. We aim for high throughput and low latency/idle time.

*   **RL Algorithm:** We propose using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) due to its stability, sample efficiency, and good performance on both discrete and continuous action spaces. Alternatively, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) could be explored for continuous control aspects. The policy network $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ and value network $V_\phi(s)$ will be implemented as small Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs).

*   **Training Procedure:**
    1.  **Pre-training in Simulation:** Train the PPO agent using the data pipeline simulator to learn a robust initial policy across a wide range of simulated hardware characteristics and workloads.
    2.  **Offline Fine-tuning:** Use collected real-world trace data (states, actions, rewards from heuristic runs or earlier RL agent versions) for offline RL fine-tuning (e.g., using techniques like Batch Constrained Q-learning (BCQ) or Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) if adapting an off-policy algorithm, or simply offline PPO if applicable).
    3.  **Online Fine-tuning:** Deploy the pre-trained/offline-tuned agent in live training runs, allowing it to continue learning and adapting to the specific dynamics of the live system (with smaller learning rates and exploration noise). Careful monitoring is needed to ensure stability.

*   **Addressing Challenges from Literature Review:**
    *   *Resource Utilization Imbalance & Dynamic Adaptation:* Directly tackled by the RL scheduler's objective function and dynamic action space.
    *   *Adaptive Compression & Prefetching:* Integrated as actions controllable by the RL agent, linking them to the overall resource state.
    *   *Integration:* Addressed by designing DRAPPS as a Python library with interfaces similar to standard `DataLoader` classes in PyTorch/TensorFlow.

**3.4 Integration with Deep Learning Frameworks**
DRAPPS will be implemented primarily in Python. It will expose an interface compatible with PyTorch's `DataLoader` and TensorFlow's `tf.data` APIs. Users would typically instantiate a `DRAPPSLoader` similar to how they use the standard loaders, passing their dataset object, batch size, and configuration options (which might include defining the available preprocessing steps and initial RL agent parameters or policy path).
