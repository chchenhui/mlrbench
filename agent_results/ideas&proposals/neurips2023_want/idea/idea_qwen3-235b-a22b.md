**Title:** **Adaptive Dimensional Parallelism for Scalable Neural Network Training with Dynamic Tensor Partitioning**

**Motivation:**  
Training large-scale models like Transformers and LLMs demands exascale computational resources, creating barriers for smaller teams and energy-inefficient workflows. Existing parallelism strategies (e.g., data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism) are often static, failing to adapt to dynamic workload patterns during training (e.g., varying compute/memory demands across layers/epochs). This leads to suboptimal resource utilization, longer training times, and higher energy consumption. A dynamic, fine-grained approach to parallelism is needed to bridge the gap between hardware heterogeneity (GPUs, TPUs, distributed clusters) and the evolving compute needs of modern architectures.

**Main Idea:**  
Propose *Adaptive Dimensional Parallelism* (ADP), a framework that dynamically reconfigures tensor-level parallelism during training by:  
1. **Runtime Workload Profiling:** Continuously monitor layer-wise compute/memory bottlenecks using lightweight kernel traces.  
2. **Dynamic Tensor Partitioning:** Adjust tensor decomposition (e.g., splitting attention heads, MLP dimensions) per layer using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize for latency and memory. For example, partition more aggressively in early layers with high redundancy and fewer workers in later stages with dense gradients.  
3. **Hybrid Parallelism Coordination:** Combine ADP with data and pipeline parallelism, using network-aware scheduling to prioritize communication-efficient configurations (e.g., fusing AllReduce operations across adaptive partitions).  
4. **Hardware-Aware Rewrites:** Customize CUDA kernel fusions for dynamic partitioning on the fly, minimizing overhead from frequent reshaping.  

*Expected outcomes:* 2-5x speedup in training LLMs/Transformers (validated on OPT-30B) with 30-50% energy reduction. *Potential impact:* Democratizes large-scale training by enabling efficient utilization of heterogeneous hardware, reducing reliance on massive clusters, and accelerating iterative research cycles for compute-limited teams.
