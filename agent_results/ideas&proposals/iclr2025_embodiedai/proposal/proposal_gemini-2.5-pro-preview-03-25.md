**1. Title:**

**UrbanVerse: A Dynamic, Multi-Agent Simulator and Benchmark Suite for Evaluating Embodied Large Language Model Agents in Open City Environments**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI), the study of agents that perceive, reason, and act within physical or simulated environments, has witnessed significant progress, particularly with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs possess remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and planning, making them promising candidates for controlling embodied agents (LLM agents). Initial successes have been demonstrated in constrained, often static indoor environments, tackling tasks like navigation and object manipulation.

However, transitioning these capabilities to complex, large-scale, open-world outdoor environments, specifically cities, remains a formidable challenge, as highlighted by the focus of the Workshop on Embodied Intelligence with Large Language Models In Open City Environment. Urban settings present unique difficulties absent in simpler domains: dynamic elements (pedestrians, vehicles with diverse behaviors), unpredictable environmental changes (weather fluctuations, time-of-day variations affecting visibility and activity patterns), complex spatial layouts, and the inherent need for multi-agent interaction and coordination. Existing simulators and benchmarks, while valuable, often lack the requisite fidelity, dynamism, or scale to adequately train and evaluate LLM agents for these real-world complexities [1, 3, 8]. Platforms like EmbodiedCity [1] and CityBench [3] have made strides in realism and LLM evaluation, but often focus on specific aspects or lack the integrated benchmark suite targeting dynamic, multi-agent, and stochastic scenarios central to our proposal. Studies like CityEQA [2] and CityNav [5] highlight the need for benchmarks focused on specific capabilities like embodied question answering and navigation, respectively, within urban contexts. The challenges of multi-agent collaboration [6] and agent robustness in unstructured environments [10] further underscore the need for more sophisticated evaluation platforms.

**2.2 Problem Statement**
There is a critical gap in the tools available for developing and assessing embodied LLM agents designed to operate robustly and intelligently in dynamic, open-world urban environments. Current simulation platforms often simplify or omit key aspects of urban reality, such as:
*   **High-fidelity Dynamics:** Realistic, unpredictable behavior of diverse entities (pedestrians, vehicles, etc.).
*   **Environmental Variability:** Dynamic weather, lighting, and time-of-day effects.
*   **Stochastic Events:** Unforeseen occurrences like accidents or road closures that demand adaptive planning and execution.
*   **Multi-Agent Complexity:** Scenarios requiring intricate coordination and interaction among multiple autonomous agents and potentially humans.
*   **Integrated Benchmarking:** A cohesive suite of tasks and metrics designed to evaluate spatial intelligence, long-horizon planning, decision-making under uncertainty, and collaboration within these complex settings.

This lack of suitable development and evaluation infrastructure hinders progress in creating LLM agents capable of performing meaningful tasks in real cities, such as autonomous delivery, emergency response, or personalized navigation assistance.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
This research aims to address the identified gap by developing *UrbanVerse*, a novel simulator and benchmark suite specifically designed for embodied LLM agents in open city environments. The primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop the UrbanVerse Simulator:** Create a high-fidelity, dynamic, multi-agent simulation platform based on real-world GIS data, incorporating:
    *   Realistic generation of diverse urban layouts.
    *   Simulation of dynamic entities (pedestrians, vehicles) with plausible behaviors.
    *   Modeling of environmental factors (weather, time-of-day) and their effects.
    *   Introduction of stochastic events to test agent adaptability.
    *   A flexible API for seamless integration with various LLM agent architectures.
2.  **Design a Comprehensive Benchmark Suite:** Curate a set of challenging tasks within UrbanVerse that probe critical capabilities for urban embodied agents, including:
    *   Complex, multi-step navigation in dynamic environments.
    *   Spatial reasoning and embodied question answering (building on concepts like CityEQA [2]).
    *   Long-horizon task planning involving multiple goals and constraints.
    *   Multi-agent collaboration scenarios (e.g., collaborative delivery, emergency response).
    *   Decision-making under uncertainty and adaptation to stochastic events.
3.  **Define Robust Evaluation Metrics:** Establish a set of clear, informative metrics to quantify agent performance across the benchmark tasks, focusing on efficiency, safety, task success, spatial understanding, planning capability, adaptability, and collaboration effectiveness.
4.  **Generate Supporting Datasets:** Produce datasets comprising simulated agent trajectories, sensor data, and interaction logs within UrbanVerse, potentially augmented with processed real-world urban activity data, to facilitate agent training and analysis.
5.  **Evaluate Baseline LLM Agents:** Implement and evaluate several baseline LLM agent architectures on the UrbanVerse benchmark suite to establish initial performance levels and demonstrate the platform's utility.

**2.4 Significance**
UrbanVerse aims to significantly advance the field of embodied AI, particularly for LLM agents operating in outdoor environments. By providing a realistic, dynamic, and challenging testbed, it will:
*   **Accelerate Research:** Enable researchers to rigorously test and compare different LLM agent architectures, perception modules, planning algorithms, and collaboration strategies in complex urban scenarios.

*   **Standardize Evaluation:** Offer a standardized benchmark suite and metrics, promoting reproducible research and objective comparison of progress in the field, addressing a key need identified in surveys [8].
*   **Bridge the Sim-to-Real Gap:** By incorporating higher fidelity and dynamics grounded in real-world data, UrbanVerse can help reduce the gap between simulation performance and real-world deployment.
*   **Enable New Applications:** Pave the way for practical applications of embodied LLM agents in areas like autonomous logistics, smart city management, personalized robotic assistance, and enhanced urban mobility.

This research directly addresses themes central to the workshop, including Spatial Intelligence and Embodied Perception (Topic 1), Reasoning and Planning (Topic 2), Decision-making and Action (Topic 3), Multi-agent Collaboration (Topic 4), and the development of Simulators, Testbeds, Datasets, and Benchmarks (Topic 5).

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 UrbanVerse Simulator Development**

*   **Architecture:** UrbanVerse will be developed using a modular architecture, likely leveraging a powerful game engine such as Unreal Engine 5 or Unity for high-fidelity rendering, physics simulation, and asset management. Key modules will include: Environment Generation, Dynamic Agent Simulation, Environmental Simulation, Stochastic Event Engine, and Agent Interface (API).
*   **Environment Generation:**
    *   **GIS Data Integration:** Utilize OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and potentially other publicly available GIS datasets (e.g., elevation maps, building footprints) to procedurally generate realistic and diverse city layouts, including road networks, buildings, parks, and points of interest (POIs).
    *   **Procedural Detail:** Enhance the base layouts with procedural generation techniques for adding details like vegetation, street furniture, and varied building facades to increase visual realism and complexity.
*   **Dynamic Agent Simulation:**
    *   **Pedestrians:** Implement pedestrian agents using established crowd simulation models (e.g., Social Force Model [Helbing & Moln√°r, 1995] or ORCA [van den Berg et al., 2008]) to simulate realistic walking patterns, collision avoidance, group behaviors, and responses to environmental cues (e.g., traffic lights, designated pathways). Parameter variations will allow for different crowd densities and behavior profiles.
    *   **Vehicles:** Simulate vehicle traffic using microscopic traffic simulation models (e.g., Intelligent Driver Model [Treiber et al., 2000]) incorporating adherence to traffic rules, lane following, acceleration/deceleration dynamics, intersection management, and basic collision avoidance. Different vehicle types (cars, buses, bikes) with varying characteristics will be included.
    *   **Behavioral Realism:** Integrate data-driven approaches where possible, potentially using anonymized real-world trajectory data to inform agent behavior models, enhancing realism beyond purely rule-based systems.
*   **Environmental Simulation:**
    *   **Time-of-Day:** Simulate continuous changes in lighting conditions based on the time of day, affecting visibility for visual sensors.
    *   **Weather:** Implement various weather conditions (clear, rain, fog, snow) that impact sensor performance (e.g., reduced visibility for cameras/LiDAR in fog/rain, altered surface friction for physics) and potentially influence dynamic agent behavior (e.g., pedestrians seeking shelter).
*   **Stochastic Event Engine:** Design a module to introduce random, unscheduled events into the simulation to test agent robustness and adaptability. Examples include: traffic accidents causing road blockages, sudden construction zones appearing, temporary pedestrian crowd surges (e.g., event dispersal), or sensor malfunctions. Event probability and type can be configured per simulation run.
*   **Agent Interface (API):**
    *   **Observation Space:** Provide agents with configurable sensory inputs, including:
        *   First-person/Third-person RGB images.
        *   Depth maps.
        *   Semantic segmentation maps.
        *   Simulated LiDAR point clouds.
        *   GPS coordinates and compass heading.
        *   Agent proprioceptive state (velocity, internal state).
        *   Textual information (e.g., current task goal, nearby POI names, street signs parsed via simulated OCR).
        *   Communication channel for multi-agent tasks.
    *   **Action Space:** Define a flexible action space suitable for LLM agents, potentially including:
        *   Low-level continuous controls (e.g., target velocity/angular velocity).
        *   Discrete high-level actions (e.g., `move_to(location)`, `follow(agent)`, `interact_with(object)`, `query_map()`, `send_message(agent, content)`).
        *   Navigation primitives (e.g., follow route segment, turn left/right at intersection).
    *   **Integration:** The API will be designed for easy integration with Python-based agent frameworks, allowing LLMs to process observations (potentially multimodal) and output actions.

**3.2 Benchmark Suite Design**

The benchmark suite will comprise several task categories, each with procedurally generated variations in different environments and conditions.

*   **Task 1: Dynamic Multi-Step Navigation:**
    *   *Description:* Agents must navigate between specified start and end locations (or a sequence of waypoints) in the city, potentially requiring long travel distances. The environment will feature dynamic obstacles (pedestrians, vehicles) and possibly time constraints.
    *   *Evaluation Focus:* Pathfinding efficiency, safety (collision avoidance), adherence to traffic rules, robustness to dynamic obstacles.
    *   *Example Scenario:* Navigate from a residential address to a specific shop in the commercial district during rush hour.
*   **Task 2: Embodied Spatial Reasoning & QA (ESR-QA):**
    *   *Description:* Similar to CityEQA [2], agents must answer questions about the environment that require active exploration, spatial understanding, and interaction (e.g., "How many red cars are parked near the post office?", "Is the library open now?", requiring navigation and potentially OCR/interaction).
    *   *Evaluation Focus:* Accuracy of answers, exploration efficiency, spatial relationship understanding (e.g., "behind", "across from"), temporal awareness (time-of-day).
*   **Task 3: Adaptive Long-Horizon Task Planning:**
    *   *Description:* Agents are given a complex goal requiring multiple sub-tasks (e.g., "Go to the pharmacy, pick up a package, then deliver it to the clinic, avoiding the main square if there's a protest"). Stochastic events may occur mid-task, requiring replanning.
    *   *Evaluation Focus:* Task completion rate, planning efficiency, adaptability to unforeseen events, logical sequencing of actions.
*   **Task 4: Multi-Agent Collaborative Tasks:**
    *   *Description:* Multiple LLM agents must coordinate to achieve a common goal.
        *   *Scenario A (Collaborative Delivery):* Multiple agents need to deliver packages efficiently across the city, potentially sharing information about traffic or dynamically reallocating tasks.
        *   *Scenario B (Emergency Response Simulation):* Agents need to coordinate to reach an incident location, perhaps clearing paths or searching different areas simultaneously based on shared information.
    *   *Evaluation Focus:* Overall team success rate, coordination efficiency (reduced redundancy, time-to-completion), communication effectiveness, individual contributions vs. team outcome [6].

**3.3 Evaluation Metrics**

A combination of metrics will be used, tailored to each task category:

*   **Task Success Rate (SR):** Binary metric indicating whether the agent achieved the primary task goal(s).
*   **Success weighted by Path Length (SPL):** [Anderson et al., 2018] Measures efficiency, penalizing suboptimal paths for successful episodes.
    $$ \text{SPL} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} S_i \frac{L_i^*}{\max(L_i, L_i^*)} $$
    where $N$ is the number of episodes, $S_i$ is a binary indicator of success in episode $i$, $L_i^*$ is the optimal path length, and $L_i$ is the agent's path length.
*   **Safety Score:** Measures the frequency and severity of collisions with pedestrians, vehicles, or static objects. Could be defined as:
    $$ \text{Safety} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{Collisions}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{Steps}_i} $$
    or a more nuanced metric weighting different collision types.
*   **Navigation Efficiency:** Time taken, distance traveled, deviation from optimal path.
*   **Planning Efficiency:** Number of replanning steps, time to generate a valid plan.
*   **Adaptability Score:** Success rate or performance degradation specifically on trials involving stochastic events compared to baseline trials without events.
*   **Collaboration Score (for multi-agent tasks):** Metrics measuring task allocation efficiency, communication overhead, idle time, and overall team objective achievement compared to hypothetical non-collaborative baselines.
*   **ESR-QA Accuracy:** Precision/Recall/F1-score for answers requiring factual information retrieved from the environment.

**3.4 Dataset Generation**

*   **Synthetic Data:** During benchmark runs, detailed logs will be generated, including:
    *   Agent trajectories (position, orientation over time).
    *   Sensor data streams (RGB, depth, LiDAR, semantic maps).
    *   Action sequences taken by the agent.
    *   Internal states/outputs from the LLM (if accessible, e.g., intermediate reasoning steps, plans).
    *   Event logs (collisions, task completion status, stochastic event occurrences).
    *   This data will be structured for potential use in imitation learning, offline reinforcement learning, or agent behavior analysis.
*   **Real-world Data (Potential Integration):** Explore incorporating anonymized public datasets (e.g., traffic flow data, pedestrian density maps) to calibrate simulator parameters or provide realistic context/initialization for simulation scenarios. Ethical considerations and data privacy will be paramount.

**3.5 Experimental Design and Validation**

*   **Baseline Agents:** Evaluate a range of agent architectures on the UrbanVerse benchmarks:
    *   *Rule-Based:* Simple heuristic agents (e.g., A* planner with basic obstacle avoidance).
    *   *Modular Perception+Planning:* Traditional pipelines (e.g., CNN for perception, classic planner).
    *   *End-to-End RL:* Agents trained using reinforcement learning (potentially challenging due to complexity).
    *   *LLM-based Agents:*
        *   Zero-shot LLM planners (using prompting).
        *   Fine-tuned LLM agents.
        *   Hierarchical agents (e.g., inspired by PMA [2], where LLM acts as high-level planner/manager).
        *   Vision-Language Model (VLM) based agents integrating visual input directly [3].
*   **Evaluation Protocol:**
    *   Run each agent type across all benchmark tasks and multiple procedurally generated variations (different city maps, starting conditions, dynamic densities, weather).
    *   Conduct sufficient trials per condition ($>30$) to ensure statistical significance.
    *   Compare performance based on the defined metrics. Analyze failure modes.
    *   Ablation studies: Evaluate the impact of specific UrbanVerse features (e.g., dynamic agents vs. static, clear weather vs. fog) on agent performance.
*   **Platform Validation:** Compare key simulation statistics (e.g., traffic flow patterns, pedestrian densities) against real-world data where possible to qualitatively assess realism. Solicit feedback from researchers in the field.
