Title  
UrbanVerse: A Dynamic, Multi-Agent Simulator and Benchmark Suite for Embodied LLM Agents in Open City Environments  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Embodied intelligence in open, large-scale urban environments challenges current AI: unlike humans, today’s large language model (LLM) agents lack robust spatial reasoning, real-time perception, and dynamic decision-making when faced with complex street networks, mobile obstacles, and stochastic events (e.g., weather changes, traffic accidents). Existing platforms such as EmbodiedCity (Gao et al., 2024) and CityBench (Feng et al., 2024) focus primarily on static or indoor environments or on narrow subsets of urban tasks. CityNav (Johnson et al., 2024) evaluates route planning but omits multi-agent collaboration and environmental stochasticity. UrbanGPT (Li et al., 2024) models spatio-temporal dynamics but does not integrate agents’ embodied actions. Multi-agent frameworks (Chen et al., 2024) highlight coordination complexity but lack realistic city backdrops.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal introduces UrbanVerse, a next-generation simulator and benchmark suite for embodied LLM agents in open city environments. UrbanVerse aims to:  
• Provide a high-fidelity, GIS-based cityscape generator that supports dynamic elements—pedestrians, vehicles, weather, time-of-day, spontaneous events (e.g., road closures).  
• Offer an API for seamless integration of LLM-driven perception, planning, and action modules.  
• Define a suite of multi-step benchmark tasks—navigation, emergency response, collaborative delivery, adaptive mapping—measured by standardized metrics.  
• Supply a diverse dataset combining synthetic trajectories and real-world urban logs for training and evaluation.  

Significance  
By capturing the richness and unpredictability of real urban settings, UrbanVerse will:  
• Advance spatial reasoning research for LLM agents beyond indoor and static domains.  
• Enable rigorous testing of multi-agent and human–agent collaboration strategies.  
• Establish community standards in benchmarks, accelerating transferable insights for autonomous navigation, smart logistics, and emergency management.  

2. Methodology  
2.1 Simulator Design  
2.1.1 Cityscape Generation  
• Data Source: OpenStreetMap (OSM) and municipal GIS repositories drive generation of road networks, building footprints, semantic annotations (land use, sidewalks, bike lanes).  
• Graph Representation: We model the city as a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ denotes intersections and points of interest, and $E$ denotes directed road segments with attributes (length $l$, speed limit $v_\text{max}$, traffic density $\rho$).  
• Dynamic Layers:  
 – Pedestrian flows: simulated via agent-based crowd models (e.g., social force).  
 – Vehicle traffic: modeled via macroscopic flow equations (Lighthill–Whitham–Richards) or microscopic car-following models.  
 – Weather and time: modular scheduler adjusts visibility, speed penalties, and event probabilities (e.g., $\Pr(\text{rain at }t)$).  

2.1.2 Stochastic Event Engine  
At each simulation step $t$, the engine samples events from predefined distributions:  
$$
\Pr(\text{road closure at }e, t) = \lambda_c \exp(-\lambda_c \Delta t),
$$  
where $\lambda_c$ is the closure rate. Similar Poisson processes govern accidents and service disruptions.  

2.2 LLM Integration API  
• Observation Interface: On request, the simulator returns a structured language description of the agent’s current perceptual field (panoramic image embeddings, LIDAR snippets, semantic tags) plus a symbolic memory of past observations.  
• Action Commands: The LLM agent issues high-level instructions (e.g., “turn north and follow the main road”) or low-level controls (acceleration, steering) via a JSON RPC endpoint.  
• Feedback Loop: The API returns status codes, reward signals, and diagnostic logs after each action.  

2.3 Benchmark Suite  
Tasks  
1. Multi-Step Navigation (MSN): Navigate from source $s$ to destination $d$ under dynamic traffic and environmental changes.  
2. Emergency Response (ER): Given an incident location $i$, coordinate multiple agents to deliver first aid kits minimizing response time and casualties.  
3. Collaborative Delivery (CD): Agents form coalitions to deliver packages across neighborhoods, optimizing collective time and energy.  
4. Adaptive Mapping (AM): Explore unknown regions, build and refine a topological map under partial observability.  

For each task, we define:  
• Success Rate $\text{SR} = \frac{N_\text{success}}{N_\text{total}}$.  
• Efficiency $E = \frac{L_\text{opt}}{L_\text{actual}}$, where $L$ is path length or time.  
• Safety Score $S = 1 - \frac{c_\text{collisions}}{c_\text{attempts}}$.  
• Cooperation Index (for multi-agent tasks):  
$$
C = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M \bigl(R_i - R_i^\text{solo}\bigr),
$$  
where $R_i$ is agent $i$’s reward in team mode, $R_i^\text{solo}$ its reward alone.  

2.4 Dataset Construction  
• Synthetic Trajectories: Generated via random walks, biased sampling along main roads, and expert-driven demonstration scripts for each task.  
• Real-World Logs: Taxi GPS trajectories, bike-share usage logs, emergency vehicle dispatch records collected (with anonymization) from partner cities.  
• Annotation: Each trajectory is paired with context logs (weather, traffic), symbolic state transitions, and human-written scenario descriptions.  

2.5 Experimental Design  
2.5.1 Baselines  
• Rule-Based Agents: A* on static map, DQN-based navigation.  
• Vision-Language Models: VL-Transformer agents pretrained on indoor simulators (e.g., Matterport) then fine-tuned on UrbanVerse.  
• Hierarchical LLM Agents: Planner-Manager-Actor architectures (as in CityEQA, 2025).  

2.5.2 Evaluation Protocol  
• Cross-City Generalization: Train on two cities, test on a held-out third city.  
• Ablation Studies:  
 – Remove dynamic layers (pedestrians, weather) to measure performance drop.  
 – Disable multi-agent communication to isolate cooperation benefits.  
• Human–Agent Comparison: A small user study where expert annotators navigate tasks via GUI; compare time and success rates.  

2.5.3 Algorithmic Pipeline  
Algorithm 1: UrbanVerse Evaluation Loop  
Input: Task set $\mathcal{T}$, Agent $\mathcal{A}$, Episodes $N$  
for each task $t\in\mathcal{T}$ do  
 for episode $1\le i\le N$ do  
   Initialize environment $E^{(i)}_t$ with random seed  
   $o_0\leftarrow E^{(i)}_t.\text{reset}()$  
   for step $k=0$ to $K_\max$ do  
    $a_k\leftarrow \mathcal{A}.\text{act}(o_k)$  
    $o_{k+1}, r_k, \text{done}\leftarrow E^{(i)}_t.\text{step}(a_k)$  
    record $(o_k,a_k,r_k)$  
    if done break  
   end for  
   Compute metrics $\{\text{SR},E,S,C\}$ for episode $i$  
 end for  
 Aggregate results over $N$ episodes  
end for  

2.5.4 Mathematical Modeling of Agent Rewards  
For single-agent tasks:  
$$
R = \sum_{k=0}^{K_\max} \Bigl(\alpha\,r^\text{progress}_k + \beta\,r^\text{collision}_k + \gamma\,r^\text{time}_k\Bigr),
$$  
where $r^\text{progress}_k$ rewards decrease in geodesic distance to goal, $r^\text{collision}_k$ penalizes collisions, and $r^\text{time}_k$ encourages faster completion. Hyperparameters $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ are tuned via grid search.
