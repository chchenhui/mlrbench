**Research Proposal: UrbanVerse: A Dynamic, Multi-Agent Simulator and Benchmark Suite for Embodied LLM Agents in Open City Environments**

---

### 1. **Introduction**

**Background**  
Embodied intelligence in open city environments remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. While recent advances in simulators like EmbodiedCity (Gao et al., 2024) and CityBench (Feng et al., 2024) have improved evaluation frameworks for urban tasks, they primarily focus on static or simplified scenarios. Real-world cities demand agents to navigate dynamic elements—pedestrians, traffic, weather—and collaborate in multi-agent systems, which existing platforms inadequately address. Furthermore, benchmarks such as CityEQA (Zhao et al., 2025) highlight the need for hierarchical planning in embodied agents, while UrbanGPT (Li et al., 2024) underscores the importance of spatio-temporal reasoning. These works collectively identify gaps in simulating complex, evolving urban environments and evaluating LLM agents under realistic conditions.

**Research Objectives**  
This project aims to develop *UrbanVerse*, a high-fidelity simulator and benchmark suite for embodied LLM agents in open city environments. Key objectives include:  
1. **Simulator Design**: Create a dynamic urban environment using real-world GIS data, integrating stochastic events (e.g., accidents, weather changes) and multi-agent interactions.  
2. **Benchmark Development**: Define tasks (e.g., emergency response, collaborative delivery) with metrics for efficiency, safety, and adaptability.  
3. **LLM Integration**: Provide APIs for perception, navigation, and decision-making, enabling LLM agents to interact with the simulator.  
4. **Dataset Curation**: Combine synthetic trajectories from UrbanVerse with real-world urban activity logs to train and test agents.  

**Significance**  
UrbanVerse will bridge the gap between static indoor benchmarks and real-world urban complexity. By enabling reproducible testing of LLM agents in dynamic scenarios, it will accelerate progress in applications like autonomous delivery, disaster response, and smart city management. The platform will also address key challenges identified in the literature, including multi-agent coordination (Chen et al., 2024) and robustness to environmental changes (Adams et al., 2024).

### 2. **Methodology**

#### **2.1 Simulator Design**

**Data Collection & Environment Generation**  
- **GIS Integration**: UrbanVerse will ingest real-world GIS data (e.g., OpenStreetMap) to generate 3D cityscapes with roads, buildings, and landmarks. Topological graphs will represent navigable paths, where nodes $v_i \in V$ denote intersections and edges $e_{ij} \in E$ represent roads.  
- **Dynamic Elements**:  
  - *Pedestrians*: Modeled using a social force framework:  
    $$\mathbf{F}_i = \sum_{j \neq i} \mathbf{f}_{ij} + \sum_{W} \mathbf{f}_{iW},$$  
    where $\mathbf{f}_{ij}$ is the repulsive force from agent $j$, and $\mathbf{f}_{iW}$ models obstacle avoidance.  
  - *Vehicles*: Traffic flow simulated via cellular automata, with velocity updates:  
    $$v_{t+1} = \min(v_t + a, v_{\text{max}}, d_{\text{front}}),$$  
    where $a$ is acceleration and $d_{\text{front}}$ is distance to the leading vehicle.  
  - *Environmental Dynamics*: Weather (rain, fog) and time-of-day effects will modulate agent perception ranges and movement speeds.  

**APIs for LLM Agents**  
- **Perception Module**: Returns object detection masks, spatial coordinates, and environmental state (e.g., weather) via JSON.  
- **Navigation Module**: Provides pathfinding using A* algorithm with cost function:  
  $$f(n) = g(n) + h(n) + \lambda \cdot \text{weather\_penalty},$$  
  where $g(n)$ is path cost, $h(n)$ is heuristic, and $\lambda$ adjusts for weather impact.  
- **Decision-Making Module**: Allows LLMs to output actions (e.g., "turn left," "wait") through natural language prompts.  

#### **2.2 Benchmark Suite Development**

**Tasks**  
1. **Multi-Step Navigation**: Agents navigate from point A to B while avoiding dynamic obstacles.  
2. **Emergency Response**: Coordinate with other agents to reach a disaster site amid road closures.  
3. **Collaborative Delivery**: Multi-agent teams optimize package delivery under time constraints.  

**Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Efficiency**: Path length $L$ and time $T$ normalized by optimal values:  
  $$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{L_{\text{optimal}}}{L_{\text{agent}}} \times \frac{T_{\text{optimal}}}{T_{\text{agent}}}.$$  
- **Safety**: Collision count $C$ and near-miss frequency $N$.  
- **Adaptability**: Success rate $S$ under randomized environmental perturbations.  

**Datasets**  
- **Synthetic Data**: Trajectories from UrbanVerse simulations, annotated with agent actions and environmental states.  
- **Real-World Logs**: Urban activity data (e.g., taxi GPS traces) to validate simulator realism.  

#### **2.3 Experimental Design**

**Baselines & Ablation Studies**  
- Compare UrbanVerse against EmbodiedCity and CityBench using state-of-the-art agents (e.g., PMA from CityEQA, UrbanGPT).  
- Ablation tests will isolate the impact of dynamic elements (e.g., disabling pedestrian movement) on agent performance.  

**Validation Protocol**  
1. **Task-Specific Trials**: 100 episodes per task, randomized initial conditions.  
2. **Statistical Analysis**: ANOVA to compare metrics across agents, with $p < 0.05$ significance threshold.  
3. **Human-in-the-Loop Testing**: Evaluate human-AI collaboration efficiency in emergency response tasks.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **UrbanVerse Simulator**: An open-source platform for simulating dynamic urban environments with multi-agent support.  
2. **Benchmark Suite**: Publicly available tasks and datasets for evaluating embodied LLM agents.  
3. **Performance Improvements**: Demonstrated gains in LLM agent efficiency (15–20%) and safety (30% fewer collisions) over baseline methods.  

**Impact**  
UrbanVerse will provide the research community with tools to advance outdoor embodied AI, addressing critical gaps identified in recent literature. By fostering reproducible evaluation and enabling complex multi-agent collaboration, it will accelerate deployments in real-world applications such as autonomous logistics and smart city infrastructure. The platform’s integration with LLMs will also drive innovation in spatio-temporal reasoning and human-AI interaction, positioning it as a cornerstone for future urban AI research.
