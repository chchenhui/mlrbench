**Title:** UrbanVerse: A Dynamic, Multi-Agent Simulator and Benchmark Suite for Embodied LLM Agents in Open City Environments  

**Motivation:** Current simulators for embodied AI often focus on static or indoor settings, lacking the complexity of open urban environments. Real-world cities involve dynamic elements (e.g., pedestrians, traffic, weather) and multi-agent interactions, which are critical for training and evaluating robust LLM agents. A dedicated simulator and benchmark suite would address the scarcity of tools to test spatial reasoning, planning, and collaboration in realistic outdoor scenarios.  

**Main Idea:** Develop *UrbanVerse*, a simulator leveraging real-world geographic information system (GIS) data to generate diverse, interactive cityscapes. The platform will simulate dynamic agents (e.g., humans, vehicles), environmental changes (e.g., weather, time-of-day), and stochastic events (e.g., accidents, road closures). It will integrate with LLM agents through APIs for perception, navigation, and decision-making. A benchmark suite will include tasks like multi-step navigation, emergency response, and collaborative delivery, with metrics for efficiency, safety, and adaptability. Datasets will combine synthetic trajectories and real-world urban activity logs. By enabling reproducible testing of embodied LLM agents in complex, evolving environments, *UrbanVerse* will accelerate progress in outdoor AI applications, from autonomous services to smart city management.
