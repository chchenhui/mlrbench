# Planning via Persuasion: Reinforcement Learning in Adversarial Language Games

## Introduction

### Background

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, but they often fall short in complex, multi-step planning and reasoning. Traditional training paradigms, which primarily rely on supervised learning and preference losses, have not sufficiently addressed the dynamic and interactive nature of language use. Ludwig Wittgenstein's concept of "language games" underscores the importance of interactive grounding in language acquisition, which is further supported by cognitive science research. Game theory experiments and language emergence simulations have demonstrated the superiority of interactive self-play loops over imitation-based models. However, the core training paradigm in language processing remains largely unchanged, highlighting the need for innovative approaches.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to enhance the planning and reasoning capabilities of LLMs by training them within an adversarial language game framework. Specifically, we aim to:
1. Develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach that leverages adversarial interaction to improve LLMs' planning and reasoning skills.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of planning accuracy, logical coherence, and robustness to adversarial inputs.
3. Investigate the scalability and practicality of this method in real-world applications.

### Significance

This research is significant for several reasons:
1. **Improved Planning Capabilities**: By introducing adversarial interaction, LLMs can learn to formulate and justify multi-step plans, enhancing their ability to handle complex tasks.
2. **Enhanced Logical Coherence**: The interactive training paradigm encourages LLMs to develop robust reasoning skills, leading to more logically coherent responses.
3. **Robustness to Adversarial Inputs**: The adversarial nature of the training setup ensures that LLMs are exposed to diverse and challenging inputs, improving their robustness and adaptability.
4. **Practical Applications**: The proposed method has potential applications in various domains, such as dialogue systems, recommendation engines, and autonomous agents, where effective planning and reasoning are crucial.

## Methodology

### Research Design

#### Data Collection

The data for this study will consist of:
1. **Training Data**: A diverse set of text-based scenarios and tasks that require multi-step planning and reasoning.
2. **Adversarial Data**: A dataset of adversarial inputs designed to challenge the LLM's planning and reasoning capabilities.

#### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Model Initialization**: Initialize two LLM agents, the Planner and the Skeptic, with pre-trained language models.
2. **Task Assignment**: Assign a planning task to the Planner, which involves formulating a multi-step plan to achieve a specific goal.
3. **Interactive Dialogue**: The Planner and the Skeptic engage in a dialogue where the Planner presents its plan and justifications, and the Skeptic challenges the plan by asking questions, pointing out flaws, or demanding further explanations.
4. **Reward Mechanism**: The Planner receives rewards based on the Skeptic's feedback. Rewards are calculated based on the Skeptic's confidence in the plan's feasibility and correctness.
5. **Policy Update**: The Planner updates its policy based on the received rewards and the Skeptic's feedback. The Skeptic's policy is also updated to improve its ability to challenge the Planner's plans.
6. **Iteration**: Steps 3-5 are repeated for multiple episodes, with the goal of gradually improving the Planner's planning and reasoning skills.

#### Mathematical Formulation

Let \( P \) be the policy of the Planner and \( S \) be the policy of the Skeptic. The reward function \( R \) can be defined as:
\[ R = f( \text{PlanFeasibility}, \text{PlanCorrectness}, \text{PlanJustification} ) \]
where \( \text{PlanFeasibility} \), \( \text{PlanCorrectness} \), and \( \text{PlanJustification} \) are the Skeptic's assessments of the Planner's plan.

The update rules for the Planner's policy \( P \) and the Skeptic's policy \( S \) can be formulated using the REINFORCE algorithm:
\[ \Delta P = \alpha \nabla_P \log P(\text{action} | \text{state}) \cdot R \]
\[ \Delta S = \beta \nabla_S \log S(\text{action} | \text{state}) \cdot R \]
where \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are learning rates.

#### Experimental Design

To validate the method, we will conduct the following experiments:
1. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare the performance of the proposed method with traditional imitation learning and supervised learning baselines.
2. **Adversarial Robustness**: Evaluate the robustness of the trained LLMs to adversarial inputs by measuring their performance on a dataset of adversarial tasks.
3. **Scalability**: Investigate the scalability of the method by training LLMs on increasingly complex planning tasks and datasets.
4. **Human Evaluation**: Conduct human evaluations to assess the quality of the LLMs' plans and justifications, as well as their ability to handle adversarial inputs.

### Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation metrics for this study include:
1. **Planning Accuracy**: The percentage of plans successfully completed by the Planner.
2. **Logical Coherence**: A metric assessing the logical consistency and coherence of the Planner's plans and justifications.
3. **Robustness to Adversarial Inputs**: The percentage of adversarial tasks successfully completed by the Planner.
4. **Human Evaluation Scores**: Scores assigned by human evaluators to assess the quality of the LLMs' plans, justifications, and responses to adversarial inputs.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact
