# Planning via Persuasion: Reinforcement Learning in Adversarial Language Games

## 1. Introduction

### Background
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language understanding and generation. However, their performance in complex, multi-step planning and reasoning tasks remains limited. Traditional training paradigms, which rely on static datasets and supervised learning, fail to provide the interactive grounding necessary for developing robust planning capabilities. Ludwig Wittgenstein’s concept of "language games" emphasizes the social and interactive nature of language acquisition, a principle supported by cognitive science research showing that dynamic, context-driven interactions are critical for genuine language learning. Despite this, most LLM training frameworks have not fully embraced interactive, game-theoretic approaches. Recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and adversarial training offer promising avenues to bridge this gap.

### Research Objectives
This research proposes a novel framework for training LLMs using **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** within an adversarial "Persuasion Game." The primary objectives are:
1. To develop a multi-agent RL framework where a Planner agent learns to generate robust multi-step plans through adversarial interaction with a Skeptic agent.
2. To enhance LLMs' planning, justification, and logical reasoning abilities by grounding training in interactive dialogue.
3. To evaluate the effectiveness of adversarial language games in improving task completion rates, logical coherence, and generalization to unseen problems.

### Significance
This work addresses two critical limitations of current LLMs: (1) their reliance on passive imitation learning, which hinders planning capabilities, and (2) their vulnerability to adversarial inputs. By formalizing language as a dynamic game, we aim to advance the theoretical foundations of interactive language learning while providing practical improvements in domains requiring complex reasoning (e.g., scientific discovery, legal analysis, or strategic decision-making). The proposed framework aligns with the workshop’s focus on Language Gamification by enabling scalable, interactive finetuning of LLMs.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Adversarial Language Game Framework

#### Core Architecture
The system involves two LLM-based agents:
- **Planner (P):** Generates multi-step plans to solve a given task.
- **Skeptic (S):** Critiques the plan, identifies flaws, and demands justifications.

The interaction unfolds as a turn-based dialogue:
1. **Initialization:** A task $ \tau $ is sampled from a distribution of planning problems (e.g., solving a math puzzle or navigating a text-based environment).
2. **Planning Phase:** $ P $ proposes a plan $ \pi = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_T\} $, where $ a_t $ is the $ t $-th action.
3. **Critique Phase:** $ S $ evaluates $ \pi $, generating counterarguments $ c \in \mathcal{C} $ (e.g., "Step 2 assumes X, but what if Y occurs?").
4. **Refinement Loop:** $ P $ revises $ \pi $ based on $ S $'s feedback. This repeats until $ S $ accepts the plan or a maximum number of rounds $ R $ is reached.

#### Reward Structure
The Planner receives a reward $ r $ based on:
- **Task Success ($ r_{task} $):** Binary signal indicating whether the plan solves $ \tau $.
- **Persuasion Success ($ r_{pers} $):** $ S $'s explicit approval of the plan.
- **Efficiency Penalty ($ r_{eff} $):** Penalizes excessive steps or rounds of dialogue.

The total reward is:
$$
r = \alpha \cdot r_{task} + \beta \cdot r_{pers} - \gamma \cdot r_{eff}
$$
where $ \alpha, \beta, \gamma $ are hyperparameters balancing task completion, persuasion, and efficiency.

### 2.2 Deep Reinforcement Learning Implementation

#### Policy Learning
We model the Planner’s policy $ \pi_\theta $ using a Transformer-based LLM with parameters $ \theta $. The Skeptic $ S $ is implemented as a fixed-rule adversary or a separately trained LLM. The Planner’s objective is to maximize expected cumulative reward:
$$
J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \mathcal{T}, \pi \sim \pi_\theta(\cdot|\tau)} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t r_t \right]
$$
where $ \gamma \in [0,1] $ is a discount factor.

#### Algorithm
We adopt **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to train $ \pi_\theta $, with the following components:
1. **State Representation:** Dialogue history $ h_t = [\tau, a_1, c_1, ..., a_t] $ is encoded using the LLM’s hidden states.
2. **Action Space:** Actions correspond to natural language responses (plan steps or revisions).
3. **Advantage Estimation:** Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) computes the benefit of each action relative to a baseline value function $ V_\phi $.

#### Training Pipeline
1. **Environment Setup:** Tasks $ \tau $ are sampled from domains requiring multi-step reasoning (e.g., ALFWorld for text-based object manipulation or synthetic math problems).
2. **Self-Play Initialization:** The Planner and Skeptic are initialized with supervised fine-tuning on human-written planning dialogues.
3. **Adversarial Finetuning:** Agents engage in $ N $ episodes of self-play, with the Planner’s policy updated via PPO after every $ K $ episodes.

### 2.3 Experimental Design

#### Datasets
- **Training:** Synthetic planning tasks generated using the **ALFWorld** environment and **GSM8K** math problems.
- **Evaluation:** Out-of-domain tasks from **StrategyQA** (reasoning) and **MuTual** (dialogue reasoning), alongside human-annotated adversarial examples.

#### Baselines
1. **Imitation Learning (IL):** Supervised fine-tuning on expert demonstration dialogues.
2. **Standard RL (w/o Adversary):** Planner trained with task rewards alone.
3. **Multi-Agent Cooperative RL:** Planner and Skeptic trained to maximize joint rewards.

#### Evaluation Metrics
1. **Task Success Rate (TSR):** Percentage of tasks solved by the final plan.
2. **Persuasion Rate (PR):** Frequency of Skeptic approval.
3. **Dialogue Coherence:** Measured using BERTScore and human evaluation (fluency, relevance).
4. **Robustness:** Performance degradation on adversarially perturbed tasks.

#### Ablation Studies
- Impact of reward components ($ \alpha, \beta, \gamma $).
- Effect of Skeptic type (rule-based vs. learned).
- Scalability with LLM size (e.g., LLaMA-7B vs. LLaMA-65B).

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### 3.1 Scientific Contributions
1. **Theoretical:** Formalize adversarial language games as a framework for grounding LLM planning in interactive learning, bridging Wittgenstein’s philosophy with computational models.
2. **Algorithmic:** Develop a scalable DRL framework for multi-agent language games, advancing the state-of-the-art in RL-driven LLM finetuning.
3. **Empirical:** Demonstrate measurable improvements in planning and reasoning tasks, with expected gains of ≥15% in TSR over imitation learning baselines.

### 3.2 Technical Advancements
- **Robust Planning:** The Skeptic’s adversarial feedback will force the Planner to develop justifications and contingency strategies, addressing current limitations in LLM explainability.
- **Generalization:** Interactive training should improve performance on out-of-distribution tasks, as evidenced by higher scores on StrategyQA and MuTual.

### 3.3 Societal Impact
1. **Education:** Enable AI tutors that dynamically adapt lesson plans through student-teacher dialogue.
2. **Scientific Discovery:** Accelerate hypothesis generation in domains like chemistry or physics by training models to debate experimental designs.
3. **Ethics:** The adversarial framework could improve alignment by encouraging models to self-criticize harmful outputs.

### 3.4 Limitations and Mitigations
- **Training Instability:** Adversarial RL can suffer from non-convergence. Mitigated by PPO’s clipped surrogate objective and curriculum learning.
- **Computational Cost:** Multi-agent training is resource-intensive. Addressed via distributed training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA).
- **Human Evaluation Bias:** Subjective metrics like coherence may vary across annotators. Mitigated by using multiple annotators and inter-rater agreement metrics (e.g., Fleiss’ κ).

## 4. Conclusion

This proposal introduces a paradigm shift in LLM training by framing language as an adversarial game that cultivates planning and reasoning. By integrating Wittgensteinian philosophy with cutting-edge DRL techniques, we aim to overcome the limitations of static, imitation-based learning. The expected outcomes will not only advance the theoretical understanding of language games but also provide practical tools for building more capable and robust AI systems. As the demand for AI-driven decision-making grows in high-stakes domains, the ability to plan, justify, and adapt through dialogue will become increasingly critical.
