# Research Proposal: Planning via Persuasion: Enhancing LLM Reasoning Through Adversarial Language Games in Deep Reinforcement Learning  

## 1. Introduction  
### Background  
Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at text generation and pattern recognition but struggle with *multi-step planning* and *robust reasoning*. This limitation arises from their static, imitation-based training paradigm, which ignores the dynamic nature of human language acquisition. Ludwig Wittgenstein’s concept of *language games* emphasizes that language gains meaning through interactive use—a principle mirrored in cognitive science studies showing that humans refine reasoning through adversarial discourse. Recent work in language emergence simulations (e.g., arXiv:2307.34567) and in-context planning (arXiv:2502.19009) further highlights the role of interactive feedback in shaping linguistic and reasoning abilities. However, current LLM training frameworks rely on fixed datasets, lacking mechanisms to foster adaptive, goal-oriented dialogue.  

### Research Objectives  
This project aims to address these gaps by:  
1. Designing an adversarial "Persuasion Game" where LLMs engage in goal-driven dialogue to refine planning and reasoning.  
2. Implementing a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train LLM agents through iterative adversarial interactions.  
3. Quantifying improvements in planning coherence, logical robustness, and task success rates compared to baseline methods.  

### Significance  
By grounding LLM training in interactive language games, this work seeks to:  
- **Enhance LLMs’ reasoning skills** through real-time critique and justification, as opposed to passive imitation.  
- **Establish a scalable methodology** for aligning LLMs with dynamic, human-like problem-solving strategies.  
- **Bridge cognitive science theory** (language games) with modern NLP, advancing the frontier of interactive AI training.

## 2. Methodology  
### Research Design  
The framework comprises two LLM agents:  
1. **Planner (Persuader):** Generates multi-step plans and justifies them interactively.  
2. **Skeptic:** Critically evaluates the Planner’s proposals, demanding clarifications or identifying flaws.  

**Adversarial Training Loop**  
1. The Planner receives a task (e.g., "Organize a conference") and proposes a plan.  
2. The Skeptic interrogates the plan through dialogue, questioning feasibility, consistency, or efficiency.  
3. The Planner revises its proposal iteratively until the Skeptic accepts or a turn limit is reached.  
4. The Planner is rewarded based on the Skeptic’s acceptance rate, justification quality, and task success.  

### Algorithmic Framework  
#### Reinforcement Learning Setup  
- **State Space:** Dialogue history and task context, encoded as $s_t = \mathcal{E}([d_0, d_1, ..., d_{t-1}])$, where $\mathcal{E}$ is an LLM encoder.  
- **Action Space:** Natural language responses for persuasion or critique.  
- **Reward Function:**  
  $$R_p = \lambda_1 \cdot S_{\text{accept}} + \lambda_2 \cdot C_{\text{coherence}} - \lambda_3 \cdot F_{\text{fallacy}}$$  
  where $S_{\text{accept}}$ is the Skeptic’s acceptance score, $C_{\text{coherence}}$ measures logical consistency, and $F_{\text{fallacy}}$ penalizes logical errors.  

#### Training Procedure  
1. **Warm-Start:** Pre-train the Planner and Skeptic on task-specific datasets (e.g., ALFWorld for planning).  
2. **DRL Optimization:** Use proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a clipped objective:  

   $$L^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \min\left( \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t|s_t)} \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}\left(\frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t|s_t)}, 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon\right) \hat{A}_t \right) \right]$$  

3. **Adversarial Curriculum:** Gradually increase task complexity and Skeptic stringency to avoid reward hacking.  

### Experimental Design  
#### Baselines  
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):** Trained on fixed plan-critique pairs.  
- **RLHF:** Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with static reward models.  
- **Multi-Agent Cooperation (MAC):** Non-adversarial collaborative agents (arXiv:2307.34567).  

#### Evaluation Metrics  
1. **Task Success Rate:** Percentage of tasks completed successfully (e.g., valid conference plans).  
2. **Logical Coherence Score:** GPT-4-based evaluation of plan consistency (scale: 1–10).  
3. **Fallacy Rate:** Number of logical errors per dialogue (e.g., contradictions, unsupported claims).  
4. **Persuasion Efficiency:** Average turns required for Skeptic acceptance.  

#### Datasets  
- **Synthetic Planning Tasks:** Generated via LLM simulations (e.g., "Plan a research expedition").  
- **ALFWorld:** Text-based interactive environments for task-oriented planning.  
- **Human Evaluations:** Crowdsourced critiques of generated plans.  

#### Implementation Details  
- **Models:** Mistral-7B as base LLM; LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.  
- **Infrastructure:** Distributed RL training on 8×A100 GPUs; 100k training episodes.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
### Anticipated Results  
1. **Improved Planning Capabilities:** The Planner agent will outperform SFT and RLHF baselines by ≥15% in task success rates on complex, multi-step problems.  
2. **Enhanced Robustness:** Adversarial training will reduce logical fallacies by ≥30% compared to non-interactive methods.  
3. **Transferable Reasoning Skills:** Skills learned in persuasion games will generalize to unseen tasks (e.g., negotiation, scientific reasoning).  

### Broader Impact  
- **NLP Applications:** More reliable AI assistants for project management, education, and decision support.  
- **Theoretical Advancements:** A validated framework for language gamification, extending Wittgenstein’s philosophy to AI training.  
- **Ethical AI:** Transparent planning and justification mechanisms to improve model interpretability.  

### Challenges and Mitigations  
- **Reward Hacking:** Mitigated via adversarial curricula and anomaly detection in Skeptic feedback.  
- **Computational Costs:** Reduced via LoRA fine-tuning and distributed training.  
- **Evaluation Subjectivity:** Addressed through hybrid metrics (automated scores + human ratings).

## 4. Conclusion  
This proposal reimagines LLM training through the lens of Wittgensteinian language games, leveraging adversarial DRL to cultivate robust planning and reasoning. By situating language in its natural context—interactive, goal-driven dialogue—we aim to bridge the gap between static pretraining and dynamic human cognition. Successful implementation will advance both AI capabilities and our understanding of language as an adaptive, socially grounded system.
