**1. Title:** **Planning via Persuasion: Enhancing LLM Reasoning through Adversarial Reinforcement Learning in Language Games**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
The landscape of Artificial Intelligence is increasingly dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, as noted by Wittgenstein's concept of "language games" and reinforced by cognitive science, language proficiency is deeply intertwined with interaction and use in context (Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations). Current LLM training paradigms, predominantly based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), primarily rely on static datasets. While effective for mimicking patterns in text, this approach often fails to cultivate deeper reasoning, planning, and grounding capabilities, which inherently benefit from dynamic, goal-oriented interaction. Research in language emergence and game theory further supports this, showing that interactive loops, potentially involving multiple agents, are potent mechanisms for developing robust communication and problem-solving strategies (e.g., White & Black, 2023).

Specific limitations observed in contemporary LLMs include difficulties with complex, multi-step planning, maintaining logical consistency over extended interactions, and justifying their reasoning processes effectively. These shortcomings suggest a potential gap in their training: the lack of sufficient interactive grounding. The "Language Gamification" workshop theme highlights this gap, proposing interactive training loops as a means to bootstrap and ground LLM abilities through multi-agent interactions. Inspired by this, we aim to leverage the power of interaction within a specifically designed language game.

**2.2 Problem Statement**
Despite their fluency, LLMs often struggle with tasks requiring robust, multi-step planning and logical reasoning. Existing training methods, focused on predicting the next token or aligning with static preferences, do not sufficiently pressure models to develop verifiable planning processes or the ability to defend their reasoning against scrutiny. This lack limits their applicability in high-stakes domains requiring reliability and explainability. There is a need for novel training paradigms that explicitly foster these capabilities through dynamic, goal-oriented interactions.

**2.3 Proposed Research: Planning via Persuasion Game**
This research proposes a novel interactive training framework, the "Planning via Persuasion" game, designed to enhance the planning and reasoning abilities of LLMs using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In this adversarial language game, two LLM agents interact:
*   **The Planner:** Tasked with generating a multi-step plan to solve a given problem.
*   **The Skeptic:** Tasked with critically evaluating the Planner's proposed plan, identifying potential flaws, inconsistencies, or ambiguities, and demanding justifications.

The Planner agent is trained using DRL, receiving rewards based on its ability to formulate a coherent, valid plan and successfully persuade the Skeptic of its correctness through interactive dialogue. The Skeptic, operating under instructions to be critically evaluative, provides the adversarial pressure necessary to drive the Planner towards more robust planning and justification strategies. This setup moves beyond passive imitation learning or simple preference alignment, forcing the Planner to engage in active reasoning, anticipate counterarguments, and ground its plans in defensible logic within an interactive loop.

**2.4 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:
1.  To formally define and implement the "Planning via Persuasion" language game framework, including the interaction protocol, agent roles, and problem domains.
2.  To develop and implement LLM-based Planner and Skeptic agents capable of engaging in this interactive dialogue game.
3.  To apply and adapt Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms (specifically, Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO) to train the Planner agent within the Persuasion Game, optimizing for plan correctness and successful persuasion.
4.  To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of this training paradigm by comparing the planning, reasoning, and justification abilities of the trained Planner agent against baseline LLMs (zero-shot, few-shot, supervised fine-tuned) on a suite of planning tasks.
5.  To analyze the emergent communication strategies and reasoning patterns developed by the Planner agent during adversarial training.

**2.5 Significance**
This research is significant for several reasons:
*   **Addresses Core LLM Limitations:** It directly targets the critical weaknesses of LLMs in complex planning and reasoning.
*   **Advances Interactive Training:** It contributes a novel, scalable method for interactive LLM finetuning, aligning with the goals of Language Gamification.
*   **Improves Robustness and Explainability:** The adversarial nature encourages the development of more robust plans and enhances the model's ability to justify its reasoning steps, potentially leading to more trustworthy AI systems.
*   **Explores Multi-Agent Dynamics:** It provides insights into using multi-agent interactions, specifically adversarial ones, for targeted capability development in LLMs, relevant to multi-agent learning research (White & Black, 2023).
*   **Connects AI to Cognitive Science:** It draws inspiration from human language acquisition and reasoning within social contexts, potentially offering new perspectives on modeling cognitive processes (as implied by the workshop's Cognitive Science topic).

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Research Design**
This research employs an experimental design centered around the development and evaluation of an LLM agent trained via DRL in the novel Persuasion Game. The methodology involves the following key phases:
1.  **Framework Development:** Defining the rules, interaction structure, and problem space of the Persuasion Game.
2.  **Agent Implementation:** Instantiating the Planner and Skeptic agents using pre-trained LLMs.
3.  **RL Training System:** Building the DRL training loop, including state representation, action space definition, reward function engineering, and RL algorithm implementation.
4.  **Training:** Executing the interactive training process over numerous game episodes across various planning problems.
5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the trained Planner's performance against baselines using quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis.
6.  **Analysis:** Investigating the learned behaviors and the impact of different design choices (e.g., reward structure, Skeptic strategy).

**3.2 The Persuasion Game Framework**
*   **Environment:** A text-based interactive environment where two agents exchange messages.
*   **Task Initiation:** Each game episode begins with a specific planning problem presented to both agents (e.g., "Arrange blocks A, B, C into stack A-B-C starting from configuration X," "Outline the steps to bake a cake given ingredients Y," "Plan a delivery route visiting locations Z"). Problems will range from simple to complex.
*   **Agent Roles:**
    *   **Planner ($A_P$):** Aims to generate a sequence of actions (the plan) $P = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\}$ that solves the problem. It must present the plan, explain steps, and defend it against the Skeptic's critiques.
    *   **Skeptic ($A_S$):** Aims to scrutinize the plan $P$ proposed by $A_P$. It asks clarifying questions, points out logical flaws, identifies missing steps or preconditions, questions feasibility, or demands justifications for specific plan steps $p_i$. Its goal is to ensure the plan is correct, complete, and sound before "accepting" it.
*   **Interaction Protocol:** Turn-based dialogue.
    1.  $A_P$ proposes an initial plan or the next part of the plan.
    2.  $A_S$ responds with critique, question, request for justification, or acceptance.
    3.  $A_P$ responds to $A_S$'s utterance (e.g., revising the plan, providing justification, asking for clarification on the critique).
    4.  Steps 2 and 3 repeat.
*   **Game Termination:** An episode ends when:
    1.  $A_S$ formally accepts the plan. (Success)
    2.  $A_S$ definitively rejects the plan after identifying an unresolvable flaw. (Failure)
    3.  A maximum number of turns or dialogue length is reached. (Failure/Timeout)
    4.  $A_P$ gives up or declares inability to satisfy $A_S$. (Failure)

**3.3 Agent Implementation**
*   **Base LLMs:** We will leverage powerful pre-trained LLMs (e.g., models from the Llama, GPT, or Mistral families) as the foundation for both agents. The choice will depend on accessibility, performance, and fine-tuning capabilities.
*   **Planner Agent ($A_P$):** This agent's core is the base LLM, further fine-tuned using DRL (specifically PPO). Its policy $\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)$ will map the current state $s_t$ to an action $a_t$ (generating the next utterance).
    *   **State ($s_t$):** The state representation will include the problem description, the dialogue history $H_t = \{u_1, u_2, ..., u_t\}$, the current plan state (if partially built), and potentially meta-information like the turn number.
    *   **Action ($a_t$):** The action is the generation of the next natural language utterance $u_{t+1}$. This is a high-dimensional, sequential decision-making problem addressed by the LLM's generative capabilities.
    *   **Policy Network:** The LLM itself acts as the policy network, parameterized by $\theta$. Fine-tuning adjusts these parameters.
*   **Skeptic Agent ($A_S$):** Initially, the Skeptic will be implemented using the same base LLM architecture but operated in a zero-shot or few-shot prompted mode. Its prompt will explicitly define its role: "You are a meticulous Skeptic. Your goal is to rigorously evaluate the plan proposed by the Planner. Find any logical flaws, missing steps, ambiguities, or unsupported claims. Ask probing questions and demand clear justifications. Only accept the plan if you are fully convinced of its correctness and feasibility."
    *   *Extension:* We may explore making the Skeptic adaptive, potentially co-evolving it or fine-tuning it on examples of effective critiques, possibly using techniques inspired by adversarial training (Johnson & Brown, 2023) or constitutional AI principles to ensure constructive skepticism.

**3.4 Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Planner**
*   **Algorithm:** We will use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), known for its stability and effectiveness in training LLMs.
*   **Reward Function ($R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$):** Designing an effective reward function is crucial and challenging. We propose a composite reward structure:
    *   **Terminal Reward ($R_{term}$):** A large positive reward ($+R_{success}$) if $A_S$ accepts the plan. A large negative reward ($-R_{fail}$) if $A_S$ rejects the plan or the game times out.
    *   **Intermediate Rewards ($R_{int}$):** Smaller rewards/penalties for specific actions or outcomes within the dialogue:
        *   Penalty for generating invalid or irrelevant utterances.
        *   Potential small penalty per turn to encourage efficiency.
        *   Small positive reward for successfully addressing a specific critique raised by $A_S$ (this might require an auxiliary reward model or rule-based checks).
        *   Small penalty for ignoring or poorly addressing $A_S$'s point.
    *   The final reward for a trajectory $\tau = (s_0, a_0, ..., s_T, a_T)$ will be the discounted sum of rewards: $G(\tau) = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$, where $\gamma \in [0, 1]$ is the discount factor.
*   **PPO Objective:** The Planner's parameters $\theta$ will be updated to maximize the PPO clipped surrogate objective function:
    $$ L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t \left[ \min(r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) \hat{A}_t) \right] $$
    where $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}$ is the probability ratio, $\hat{A}_t$ is the estimated advantage function (e.g., using Generalized Advantage Estimation - GAE), and $\epsilon$ is the clipping hyperparameter. The full PPO objective often includes terms for value function loss and entropy bonus.
*   **Training Loop:**
    1.  Initialize Planner policy $\pi_\theta$ (e.g., with weights from a pre-trained LLM).
    2.  For a number of iterations:
        a. Collect a batch of interaction trajectories by playing the Persuasion Game between $A_P(\pi_\theta)$ and $A_S$.
        b. Compute rewards for each step in the trajectories.
        c. Estimate advantage values $\hat{A}_t$ for each state-action pair.
        d. Update the Planner's policy parameters $\theta$ by optimizing the PPO objective using stochastic gradient ascent.
        e. Update any associated value function network.
*   **Curriculum Learning:** We will likely employ curriculum learning, starting with simpler planning problems and gradually increasing complexity as the Planner agent improves.

**3.5 Experimental Design and Validation**
*   **Datasets:** We will curate or generate diverse planning problems across different domains (e.g., logical puzzles like blocksworld, procedural tasks like recipe generation, simple scheduling, pathfinding descriptions). A held-out set will be used exclusively for evaluation.
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **Zero-shot/Few-shot LLM:** The base LLM prompted to solve the planning task directly.
    2.  **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):** The base LLM fine-tuned on a dataset of (problem, plan) pairs (imitation learning).
    3.  **Self-Correction/Refinement LLM:** An LLM using prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought or self-critique to generate and refine plans without interactive adversarial training.
    4.  *(Optional)* A simpler RL baseline, e.g., RL with reward based only on final plan correctness determined by a verifier, without the Skeptic interaction.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Task Success Rate:** Percentage of test problems where the generated plan is accepted by the Skeptic (or deemed correct by an independent validator/human judges).
    2.  **Plan Quality (Automated):** Metrics like plan validity (checked against domain rules/simulator), plan efficiency (e.g., number of steps vs. optimal), and logical consistency checks.
    3.  **Plan Quality (Human):** Human evaluators assessing plan correctness, coherence, feasibility, and completeness on a Likert scale.
    4.  **Justification & Interaction Quality (Human):** Human evaluators assessing the Planner's ability to provide clear, relevant justifications, handle critiques constructively, and maintain coherent dialogue throughout the interaction. Metrics include persuasiveness, logical soundness of arguments, and relevance of responses.
    5.  **Interaction Efficiency:** Average number of dialogue turns or tokens required to reach a resolution (acceptance or rejection).
    6.  **Robustness:** Testing the Planner against variations in Skeptic strategies (e.g., more aggressive, focusing on different types of flaws) or slightly ambiguous problem statements.
*   **Ablation Studies:** We will systematically evaluate the contribution of different components:
    *   Impact of different reward components (terminal vs. intermediate).
    *   Impact of the Skeptic's strategy (fixed prompt vs. adaptive).
    *   Effectiveness compared to non-adversarial interactive learning (e.g., cooperative plan refinement).
    *   Influence of the base LLM choice.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**
1.  **A Novel Interactive Training Framework:** A fully implemented and documented "Planning via Persuasion" game framework suitable for training LLMs interactively.
2.  **Enhanced Planner Agent:** An LLM agent (the Planner) trained via this framework that exhibits significantly improved performance on complex planning tasks compared to baseline methods. We expect improvements in:
    *   Generating correct, complete, and logically sound multi-step plans.
    *   Providing coherent and persuasive justifications for its plan steps.
    *   Effectively revising plans in response to valid criticism.
    *   Handling adversarial questioning during the planning process.
3.  **Quantitative and Qualitative Evidence:** Rigorous empirical results demonstrating the benefits of the adversarial RL approach through automated metrics and human evaluations. Qualitative analysis will showcase examples of dialogue, highlighting learned reasoning and persuasion strategies.
4.  **Insights into LLM Training:** Deeper understanding of how structured, adversarial interaction can be used to cultivate specific cognitive abilities like planning and reasoning in LLMs, potentially overcoming limitations of static training data. This addresses key challenges like interactive training complexity and evaluation identified in the literature review (e.g., Challenge 1, 5).
5.  **Analysis of Emergent Behaviors:** Observations on the types of planning strategies, justification techniques, and negotiation tactics that emerge through the adversarial training process.

**4.2 Potential Impact**
*   **Methodological Advancement:** This research will contribute a novel DRL-based interactive training paradigm to the field of Language Gamification, offering a concrete method for grounding LLM abilities in goal-directed interaction. It provides an alternative or complement to existing SFT and RLHF approaches.
*   **Improved AI Capabilities:** The resulting models, with enhanced planning and reasoning skills, could lead to more capable and reliable AI systems for applications requiring complex task execution, such as sophisticated AI assistants, automated scientific discovery tools, logistics optimization, and complex instruction following in robotics (linking to SRLM by Wang et al., 2024).
*   **Enhanced Trustworthiness and Explainability:** By forcing models to justify their plans against scrutiny, this method has the potential to produce LLMs whose reasoning processes are more transparent and defensible, contributing to trustworthy AI.
*   **Theoretical Insights:** The work may provide insights into the relationship between adversarial interaction, language use, and the development of reasoning, drawing parallels with cognitive development and philosophical ideas about language games. It explores how competition and critique can drive learning in language-based agents.
*   **Addressing Scalability and Robustness:** While challenges exist (Challenge 2, 3), this framework offers a structured approach to multi-agent interaction that might be more scalable than open-ended dialogues. The adversarial nature directly targets robustness against a form of critical or "adversarial" input during interaction.

In conclusion, the proposed research on "Planning via Persuasion" offers a promising direction for advancing LLM capabilities through interactive, adversarial language games. By leveraging DRL within this framework, we aim to cultivate deeper planning, reasoning, and justification skills, contributing significantly to the goals of Language Gamification and the development of more intelligent and reliable AI systems.
