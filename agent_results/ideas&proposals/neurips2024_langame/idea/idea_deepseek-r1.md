**Title:** Interactive Language Games as Reinforcement Learning Frameworks for LLM Planning  

**Motivation:** Current LLM training relies on static datasets, limiting their ability to develop adaptive planning and context-sensitive reasoningâ€”skills humans gain through interactive language use. Bridging this gap requires frameworks that simulate dynamic, social language learning.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework where cooperative or competitive LLM agents engage in goal-driven language games. Agents solve tasks (e.g., collaborative puzzle-solving, negotiation) by generating language-based strategies. Each agent receives rewards based on task success (environment feedback) and communication clarity (peer evaluation via preference modeling). For example, in a treasure-hunt game, agents must guide each other using natural language, refining instructions iteratively. RL algorithms (e.g., PPO) optimize both task performance *and* language efficacy, while opponent/partner sampling ensures adaptability. Expected outcomes include LLMs that dynamically refine planning strategies through interaction, improving zero-shot task generalization and personalized reasoning. This could enable applications like collaborative AI assistants or adaptive educational tools requiring real-time language-based coordination.
