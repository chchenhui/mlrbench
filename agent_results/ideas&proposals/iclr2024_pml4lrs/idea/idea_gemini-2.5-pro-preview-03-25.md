**Title:** Adaptive Knowledge Distillation for Few-Shot Learning on Resource-Constrained Devices

**Motivation:** Few-shot learning addresses data scarcity, a common issue in low-resource settings. However, deploying even few-shot adapted models on computationally limited devices (e.g., basic smartphones, microcontrollers) remains a significant hurdle. This research aims to bridge this gap by enabling efficient deployment of models trained with limited data onto constrained hardware.

**Main Idea:** We propose an adaptive knowledge distillation framework specifically designed for few-shot learning under hardware constraints. A large, pre-trained "teacher" model (potentially trained on broader, albeit possibly biased, data) will guide the training of a highly compact "student" model architecture suitable for edge devices. Crucially, the distillation process will occur *during* the few-shot adaptation phase. We will investigate techniques where the distillation loss dynamically adjusts based on the target task's few examples and the specific hardware constraints (e.g., latency budget, memory footprint). Expected outcomes include student models that achieve strong few-shot performance while meeting strict efficiency requirements, enabling practical deployment of adaptive AI solutions (e.g., local crop disease identification, personalized educational content delivery) directly on affordable devices in developing regions.
