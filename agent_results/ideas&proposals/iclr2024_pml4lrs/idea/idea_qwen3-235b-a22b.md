1. **Title**: Domain-Aware Model Compression for Low-Resource Deployment in Developing Regions  

2. **Motivation**: Model compression techniques (e.g., pruning, distillation) enable deployment on resource-constrained devices but often neglect domain shifts between pre-training data and local environments in developing countries. This leads to poor performance in critical applications like healthcare or agriculture, where data distributions differ significantly from global benchmarks. Addressing this gap is essential to ensure ML solutions are both efficient and equitable.  

3. **Main Idea**: We propose a **domain-aware model compression framework** that integrates domain adaptation into compression workflows. Using a small amount of target-domain data (e.g., local crop images, dialect text), the method identifies domain-specific features (via activation patterns or adversarial alignment) and guides compression to preserve these features. For example, during knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on diverse data transfers knowledge to a lightweight student model, with a loss function emphasizing domain-invariant representations. Similarly, pruning strategies could prioritize retaining filters activated by local data. We will validate this on real-world tasks (e.g., low-cost tuberculosis detection via mobile X-rays in rural clinics) and benchmark against standard compression baselines. Expected outcomes include models with 20–30% smaller size and 5–10% higher accuracy in target domains. This work bridges the divide between SOTA efficiency and localized effectiveness, enabling deployable, fair ML solutions in resource-limited settings.
