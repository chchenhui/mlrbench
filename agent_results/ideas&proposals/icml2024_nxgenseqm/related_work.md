**Key Challenges:**

1. **Memory Retention and Access**: Existing sequence models struggle to retain and access information across very long sequences, leading to performance degradation in tasks requiring deep contextual understanding.

2. **Computational Efficiency**: Balancing the need for long-range dependency modeling with computational efficiency remains a significant challenge, as many models face increased resource demands when processing extended sequences.

3. **Adaptive Memory Management**: Developing mechanisms that dynamically manage memory—deciding what information to store, compress, retrieve, or discard based on contextual importance—is complex and critical for effective long-sequence modeling.

4. **Scalability**: Ensuring that models can scale to handle sequences of 100K+ tokens without compromising performance or efficiency is a persistent challenge in the field.

5. **Generalization Across Domains**: Achieving models that generalize well across different tasks and domains, especially when dealing with varying sequence lengths and structures, remains an open problem in sequence modeling research.
