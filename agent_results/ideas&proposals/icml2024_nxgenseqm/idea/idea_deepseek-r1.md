**Title:** Dynamic Hybrid Architectures for Adaptive Long-Range Context Modeling  

**Motivation:** Current sequence models face a fundamental trade-off: transformers excel at local interactions but struggle with long contexts due to quadratic attention costs, while state-space models (e.g., Mamba) efficiently handle long sequences but may underperform on tasks requiring fine-grained local reasoning. A unified architecture that dynamically adapts computation to sequence structure could bridge this gap, improving efficiency and performance across diverse tasks.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a hybrid architecture that combines state-space blocks (for long-range dependencies) and sparse attention mechanisms (for local interactions), with a learned gating mechanism to route tokens to the appropriate module. The gating network will use lightweight features (e.g., token position, local entropy, or gradient-based saliency) to predict whether a token benefits more from local or global context. Training will employ a two-phase approach: pretrain components separately for stability, then jointly fine-tune with a budget-aware loss that penalizes unnecessary computation. Expected outcomes include improved perplexity on language modeling benchmarks with mixed-context requirements (e.g., books + code) and 30-50% faster inference than pure transformers on long sequences. This could enable scalable models that adaptively balance hardware constraints and context needs.
