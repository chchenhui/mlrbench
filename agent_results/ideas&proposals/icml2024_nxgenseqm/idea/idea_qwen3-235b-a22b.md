1. **Title**: **Cross-Length Generalization via Dynamic Hierarchical Memory in Sequence Models**  
2. **Motivation**: Sequence models often fail to generalize to longer sequences than those seen during training, limiting their use in tasks like long-document understanding or genome analysis. Fixed-depth architectures waste resources on short sequences while struggling with extended contexts, highlighting the need for adaptive, efficient solutions.  
3. **Main Idea**: Propose a dynamic architecture that adjusts computational depth and memory allocation based on input complexity. A meta-controller learns to route inputs through a subset of Transformer layers or state-space modules, prioritizing resource efficiency for short sequences and deeper processing for longer ones. A hierarchical memory bank stores task-specific representations at multiple granularities, enabling cross-length knowledge transfer. Training uses curriculum learning, incrementally increasing sequence length, while a reinforcement learning component optimizes resource allocation. Evaluate on language modeling, mathematical reasoning, and bioinformatics tasks. Expected outcomes include improved generalization to unseen lengths, reduced inference costs, and better robustness to out-of-distribution data. This work bridges the gap between static architectures and adaptable, efficient models for real-world applications.
