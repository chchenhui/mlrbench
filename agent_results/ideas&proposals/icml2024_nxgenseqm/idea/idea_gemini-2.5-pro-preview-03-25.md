**Title:** Adaptive State Reset Mechanisms for Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Continuous Learning for State Space Models

**Motivation:** While SSMs like Mamba excel at handling long sequences efficiently, deploying them in continuous learning scenarios (where data arrives sequentially) remains challenging. Existing models can suffer from catastrophic forgetting or state explosion when processing indefinitely long or non-stationary data streams. This research aims to enable robust continuous learning within the SSM paradigm.

**Main Idea:** We propose embedding an adaptive state reset mechanism within SSM architectures. This mechanism, potentially implemented as a small, learned gating network, would monitor the SSM's internal state dynamics or prediction uncertainty. When encountering significant distribution shifts or reaching a state saturation point (indicating potential forgetting or instability), the gate would trigger a partial or full reset of the hidden state, preserving essential long-term knowledge while allowing adaptation to new patterns. We will evaluate this on streaming benchmarks (e.g., sequential CIFAR, time-series forecasting with regime changes) and compare against baseline SSMs and continual learning strategies. Expected outcomes include more stable and adaptive SSMs for real-world, continuous data applications.
