1. **Title**: TextGuard: Provable Defense against Backdoor Attacks on Text Classification (arXiv:2311.11225)
   - **Authors**: Hengzhi Pei, Jinyuan Jia, Wenbo Guo, Bo Li, Dawn Song
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces TextGuard, the first provable defense against backdoor attacks in text classification. TextGuard partitions training data into sub-training sets by splitting sentences, ensuring most subsets are free from backdoor triggers. Each subset trains a base classifier, and their ensemble provides the final prediction. The authors prove that TextGuard's predictions remain unaffected by triggers of certain lengths, offering a formal security guarantee. Empirical evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple text classification tasks.

2. **Title**: Backdoor Federated Learning by Poisoning Backdoor-Critical Layers (arXiv:2308.04466)
   - **Authors**: Haomin Zhuang, Mingxian Yu, Hao Wang, Yang Hua, Jian Li, Xu Yuan
   - **Summary**: This study identifies backdoor-critical (BC) layers in federated learning models—specific layers that, when compromised, can effectively introduce backdoors. The authors propose a method to identify and exploit these BC layers, enabling backdoor attacks that are both effective and stealthy, even under state-of-the-art defenses. Experiments show that targeting BC layers allows successful backdoor insertion with a minimal number of malicious clients.

3. **Title**: ReVeil: Unconstrained Concealed Backdoor Attack on Deep Neural Networks using Machine Unlearning (arXiv:2502.11687)
   - **Authors**: Manaar Alam, Hithem Lamri, Michail Maniatakos
   - **Summary**: ReVeil introduces a concealed backdoor attack that operates during the data collection phase, requiring no access to the model or auxiliary data. The attack maintains a low pre-deployment attack success rate to evade detection and restores high success rates post-deployment through machine unlearning. The method is evaluated across multiple datasets and trigger patterns, successfully evading popular backdoor detection methods.

4. **Title**: BELT: Old-School Backdoor Attacks can Evade the State-of-the-Art Defense with Backdoor Exclusivity Lifting (arXiv:2312.04902)
   - **Authors**: Huming Qiu, Junjie Sun, Mi Zhang, Xudong Pan, Min Yang
   - **Summary**: BELT enhances the stealthiness of traditional backdoor attacks by increasing backdoor exclusivity—the ability of triggers to remain effective despite input variations. By suppressing associations between backdoors and fuzzy triggers, BELT enables old-school backdoor attacks to evade seven state-of-the-art defenses without compromising attack success rates or model utility.

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Domain-Specific Defenses**: Many existing backdoor detection and defense mechanisms are tailored to specific domains, such as computer vision or natural language processing, limiting their applicability across diverse machine learning applications.

2. **Adaptability to Unseen Attacks**: Current defenses often struggle to detect novel or unseen backdoor attack patterns, highlighting the need for more adaptive and generalizable detection methods.

3. **Data Efficiency**: Effective backdoor detection typically requires substantial amounts of clean data, which may not always be available, especially in scenarios involving pre-trained models or federated learning.

4. **Stealthiness of Attacks**: Attackers continually develop more sophisticated and stealthy backdoor techniques that evade existing detection methods, necessitating continuous advancements in defense strategies.

5. **Cross-Domain Transferability**: The ability of backdoor attacks to transfer across different domains poses significant security risks, and current defenses may not effectively address such cross-domain threats.
