# Blockchain-Based Backdoor Detection Framework for Federated Learning

## Motivation
Federated Learning (FL) is particularly vulnerable to backdoor attacks due to its distributed nature where malicious participants can inject poisoned updates. Current defense methods often require centralized validation data or expensive computation, making them impractical for real-world FL deployments. There's an urgent need for a transparent, decentralized approach to detect and mitigate backdoor attacks while preserving the privacy benefits of FL.

## Main Idea
I propose a blockchain-based framework for backdoor detection in federated learning that leverages smart contracts to validate model updates without compromising privacy. The system works by implementing a multi-stage validation protocol: (1) Client updates are first locally validated through anomaly detection against historical update patterns; (2) These updates and validation results are recorded on a permissioned blockchain; (3) Smart contracts automatically execute consensus algorithms to identify statistical outliers in model updates that may indicate poisoning; (4) A reputation system tracks client trustworthiness over time; and (5) Suspicious updates trigger targeted pruning techniques applied through federated execution. This approach provides an auditable defense mechanism that scales with FL deployments, requires no central validation data, and creates economic disincentives for attackers through the reputation system. The framework can be adapted across domains by customizing the anomaly detection components for specific data modalities while maintaining the blockchain infrastructure.
