1. **Title**: AutoCurate-FM: Automated Dataset Curation for Foundation Models via Self-Supervised Data Quality Assessment  
2. **Motivation**: Foundation Models (FMs) rely on massive, heterogeneous datasets, which often contain noisy, redundant, or harmful content. Manual curation is infeasible at scale, while existing automated methods lack alignment with FM-specific quality metrics (e.g., factual consistency, bias, or task relevance). This work addresses the critical need for efficient, adaptive curation frameworks to improve FM reliability, safety, and training efficiency.  
3. **Main Idea**: We propose AutoCurate-FM, a self-supervised framework that leverages the FMâ€™s own knowledge to dynamically assess and curate training data. The method uses contrastive learning to train a lightweight data-quality scorer (DQS) on FM-generated metadata (e.g., attention patterns, uncertainty estimates, and semantic embeddings). The DQS ranks data points by quality, safety (e.g., toxicity, bias), and task-specific relevance, enabling iterative pruning and augmentation of the training set. We hypothesize that FMs trained on AutoCurate-FM-optimized datasets will show improved performance on downstream tasks (e.g., reduced hallucination rates, higher coherence) while requiring fewer training resources. Evaluation will include benchmarking against manual curation baselines and measuring fairness, robustness, and computational efficiency. This approach bridges the gap between data-centric AI and FM scalability, offering a plug-and-play solution for ethical and efficient model development.
