# Reinforcement Learning-Driven Dynamic Data Curation for Safety-Aligned Foundation Models

## Introduction

Foundation Models (FMs) such as GPT-4, LLaMA, and DALL-E have revolutionized artificial intelligence with their unprecedented performance across diverse domains. These models, trained on vast collections of internet-scale data, have demonstrated remarkable abilities in natural language understanding, generation, and multimodal reasoning. However, this reliance on large, uncurated datasets introduces significant challenges related to the propagation of harmful content, biases, and misaligned values.

The critical role of training data in shaping model behavior has given rise to the emerging paradigm of data-centric AI, which emphasizes the quality and composition of datasets rather than model architecture alone. Recent research, including Safety Pretraining (Maini et al., 2025) and Safer-Instruct (Shi et al., 2023), has demonstrated that addressing data problems is fundamental to ensuring that foundation models align with human values and operate safely.

The traditional approaches to data curation for safety alignment typically involve manual filtering or post-training interventions. Manual filtering is labor-intensive, subjective, and scales poorly with the massive datasets required for foundation models. Post-training interventions like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) and instruction fine-tuning, while effective, often struggle to correct deeply embedded patterns learned during pretraining. As noted by Maini et al. (2025), safety considerations embedded during pretraining are more effective than those addressed only during fine-tuning.

This research proposes a novel approach: Reinforcement Learning-Driven Dynamic Data Curation (RL-DDC), a framework that leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically and automatically curate training data for foundation models with safety alignment considerations from the outset. This approach addresses the scalability limitations of manual curation while providing a flexible, adaptive mechanism to balance safety with model capabilities.

The objectives of this research are to:
1. Develop a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically selects and weights training samples based on safety and alignment criteria
2. Design efficient reward models that effectively capture diverse safety concerns and alignment objectives
3. Demonstrate that models trained on dynamically curated datasets exhibit enhanced safety and alignment properties without significant degradation of performance on standard tasks
4. Establish a methodology for continuous improvement of data curation policies as safety standards and alignment objectives evolve

The significance of this research extends beyond the immediate goal of producing safer foundation models. By establishing a dynamic, data-centric approach to alignment, we contribute to the broader mission of ensuring AI systems respect human values and preferences. As foundation models become increasingly integrated into critical applications, automated approaches to safety alignment at scale become essential for responsible AI deployment.

## Methodology

### Overview

The RL-DDC framework consists of four main components:
1. A data pool management system for organizing and accessing candidate training samples
2. A reward model that quantifies safety and alignment properties of data samples
3. A reinforcement learning agent that learns a policy for selecting and weighting training samples
4. A model training and evaluation pipeline that provides feedback to the RL agent

The framework operates in an iterative fashion, progressively refining the data selection policy to improve safety and alignment properties of the trained foundation model. Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture.

### Data Pool Management

We will establish a candidate pool drawn from diverse text corpora including:
- CommonCrawl web data
- Books and academic publications
- Conversational data from various sources

Each data sample $x_i$ in the pool is associated with a feature vector $f(x_i)$ that captures characteristics relevant to safety and alignment. These features include:
- Text length and complexity metrics
- Topic and domain indicators derived from unsupervised clustering
- Preliminary toxicity and bias scores from off-the-shelf classifiers

The data pool is organized into stratified subsets to ensure diversity and representation across domains and content types. The pool management system supports efficient random access, filtering, and tracking of selection history.

### Reward Model Design

The reward model $R(x_i)$ assigns a scalar value to each data sample $x_i$ based on its safety and alignment properties. We design a composite reward function:

$$R(x_i) = \alpha \cdot R_{safety}(x_i) + \beta \cdot R_{alignment}(x_i) + \gamma \cdot R_{diversity}(x_i)$$

where:
- $R_{safety}(x_i)$ measures the absence of toxic, harmful, or biased content
- $R_{alignment}(x_i)$ quantifies alignment with human values and preferences
- $R_{diversity}(x_i)$ encourages representation of diverse topics and perspectives
- $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are weighting parameters

For $R_{safety}$, we employ a combination of:
1. Scores from existing toxicity classifiers (e.g., Perspective API)
2. Outputs from specialized classifiers trained to detect subtle forms of bias and harmful content
3. Adversarial red-teaming techniques to identify potential misuse vectors

For $R_{alignment}$, we utilize:
1. Small sets of human-labeled examples as alignment anchors
2. Proxy measures derived from constitutional AI principles
3. Expert model evaluations (similar to Safer-Instruct by Shi et al., 2023)

For $R_{diversity}$, we implement:
1. Representation metrics across predefined content categories
2. Information-theoretic measures of distance from already selected samples
3. Coverage metrics for essential knowledge domains

The reward model is initially calibrated using a small set of human-annotated examples and is periodically refined based on model performance and targeted evaluations.

### Reinforcement Learning Agent

We formulate the data curation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP):
- States: Current composition of the selected dataset and model performance metrics
- Actions: Selection probabilities for each candidate sample in the data pool
- Rewards: Composite score from the reward model and downstream model performance
- Transitions: Determined by the effect of adding selected samples to the training dataset

The RL agent learns a policy $\pi(a|s)$ that determines the probability of selecting each sample given the current state. We implement this using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which has shown good performance in complex decision-making tasks.

The policy network architecture consists of:
- An encoder that processes sample features and current dataset statistics
- A policy head that outputs selection probabilities
- A value head that estimates expected rewards for improved training stability

The objective function for policy optimization is:

$$L(\theta) = \hat{E}_t \left[ \min\left(r_t(\theta)\hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)\hat{A}_t\right) \right] + c_1 L^{VF}(\theta) - c_2 S[\pi_\theta](s_t)$$

where:
- $r_t(\theta)$ is the probability ratio between new and old policies
- $\hat{A}_t$ is the estimated advantage
- $L^{VF}$ is the value function loss
- $S$ is an entropy bonus for exploration
- $c_1$ and $c_2$ are coefficients

The agent operates in batches, selecting mini-batches of samples for model training, observing the resulting model performance, and updating its policy accordingly.

### Training and Evaluation Pipeline

The training pipeline consists of:

1. **Initial model selection**: We start with a small, efficient foundation model architecture (e.g., a reduced-scale transformer with 1-2B parameters) to enable rapid iteration.

2. **Iterative training process**:
   - The RL agent selects a batch of samples from the candidate pool
   - The model is trained (or fine-tuned) on the selected samples
   - The trained model is evaluated on safety and capability benchmarks
   - Results inform the reward model and update the RL agent's policy

3. **Periodic curriculum updates**:
   - As the model improves on basic safety criteria, we introduce more complex alignment objectives
   - The reward model is adjusted to emphasize different aspects of safety and alignment
   - The candidate pool is expanded with more challenging examples

4. **Evaluation suite**:
   - Safety evaluation: We use established benchmarks such as ToxiGen, RealToxicityPrompts, and BBQ
   - Alignment evaluation: We assess models using safety preference datasets, refusal tests, and red-teaming
   - Capability evaluation: Standard benchmarks including MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K
   - Novel challenge scenarios designed to test for subtle safety and alignment failures

The evaluation metrics include:
- Toxicity scores and bias measurements
- Attack success rates on adversarial inputs
- Refusal rates for harmful instructions
- Performance degradation relative to baseline models on standard tasks
- Diversity of model outputs and handling of underrepresented content

### Implementation Details

The training procedure follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```
   Initialize foundation model M_0 with random or pretrained weights
   Prepare candidate pool D = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_N}
   Initialize RL policy π_θ with random weights
   Initialize empty training dataset T_0
   ```

2. **Iterative Curation and Training**:
   ```
   For each iteration i = 1 to K:
     # Data selection phase
     For j = 1 to batch_count:
       Compute state representation s_i,j based on T_{i-1} and M_{i-1}
       Sample actions a_i,j ~ π_θ(·|s_i,j) to select data batch B_i,j
       Add B_i,j to T_i with weights determined by policy
       Compute reward R(B_i,j) based on safety and alignment metrics
     
     # Model training phase
     Train model M_i on weighted dataset T_i
     
     # Evaluation phase
     Evaluate M_i on safety benchmarks S_i and capability benchmarks C_i
     Compute composite performance metric P_i = f(S_i, C_i)
     
     # Policy update phase
     Update policy π_θ using PPO with rewards R and performance P_i
     Update reward model based on evaluation results
   ```

3. **Final Model Selection**:
   ```
   Select model version with optimal balance of safety and capability metrics
   Perform thorough evaluation on holdout test sets
   ```

To ensure efficient implementation, we utilize distributed training for both the foundation model and the RL agent. The data pipeline leverages efficient data loading and preprocessing techniques to handle the large-scale candidate pool.

1. **Enhanced Safety Profile**: We anticipate foundation models trained using RL-DDC will demonstrate significantly reduced propensities for generating toxic, biased, or harmful content. Specifically, we expect a 40-60% reduction in attack success rates on standard safety benchmarks compared to models trained on uncurated data.

2. **Preserved Capabilities**: Unlike rigid filtering approaches, our dynamic curation method is designed to maintain model capabilities by intelligently balancing safety with utility. We expect no more than a 5% degradation on standard capability benchmarks while achieving substantial safety improvements.

By automating the data curation process with reinforcement learning, we enable scalable, adaptive approaches to safety alignment that can evolve with our understanding of AI risks and societal values. This research bridges the gap between the theoretical goals of AI alignment and the practical realities of training models on internet-scale datasets, contributing to the development of AI systems that better reflect human values and preferences.
