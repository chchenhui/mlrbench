# WeightGAN: Generative Modeling of Neural Network Weights

## Motivation
The explosion in publicly available neural network models presents an unprecedented opportunity to treat model weights as a structured data modality. While model merging techniques have shown promise, they typically rely on heuristic approaches that don't capture the full distribution of viable weights. By learning to generate functional neural network weights directly, we can enable more principled model synthesis, transfer learning, and architecture search without the computational burden of traditional training. This approach could revolutionize how we create and adapt models, making AI development more efficient and accessible.

## Main Idea
WeightGAN proposes a generative adversarial framework specifically designed for neural network weight spaces. The generator will produce realistic model weights conditioned on desired model properties (task, performance level, efficiency constraints), while the discriminator learns to distinguish between generated weights and those from successfully trained models. To handle weight space symmetries (permutations, scaling), we introduce specialized equivariant components in both networks. The approach incorporates architectural inductive biases reflecting neural network structure (e.g., treating convolutional kernels differently from fully-connected layers). Beyond generating new models, WeightGAN enables controlled weight space interpolation and extrapolation, allowing practitioners to navigate the functional manifold of models and discover novel architectures with desired properties through latent space manipulation.
