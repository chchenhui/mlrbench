# Permutation-Equivariant Contrastive Embeddings for Model Zoo Retrieval

## Introduction

The exponential growth of publicly available neural network models, with repositories exceeding a million entries, presents a significant challenge for practitioners. Traditional metadata-based search methods often fail to capture the latent functional similarities hidden within the raw weights of these models, leading to redundant training and wasted computational resources. This research proposal aims to address this challenge by introducing a permutation-equivariant encoder that maps neural network weight tensors into a compact embedding space, respecting layer symmetries such as neuron permutations and scaling. The proposed method leverages contrastive learning to learn embeddings that cluster models by task and capability, enabling efficient retrieval of pre-trained networks suited to new tasks. This framework not only streamlines model selection in massive zoos but also paves the way for automated, weight-space-driven architecture search and transfer learning.

### Background

Neural networks have become ubiquitous in various domains, with pre-trained models serving as a cornerstone for many applications. However, the sheer number of available models makes it difficult for practitioners to identify the most suitable network for a given task. Current search methods rely on metadata such as architecture type, hyperparameters, and training datasets, which may not fully capture the functional similarities between models. This limitation leads to inefficient model selection processes, resulting in redundant training and suboptimal performance.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a permutation-equivariant contrastive learning framework for embedding neural network weights. The specific goals include:

1. **Characterization of Weight Space Symmetries**: Effectively modeling and embedding neural network weights require accounting for inherent symmetries such as permutations and scalings.
2. **Efficient Representation and Manipulation**: Design an encoder that maps weight tensors into a compact embedding space while respecting these symmetries.
3. **Contrastive Learning for Embedding**: Utilize contrastive learning to learn embeddings that capture functional similarities between models, enabling efficient retrieval.
4. **Evaluation of Retrieval Performance**: Assess the quality of the retrieval system using robust evaluation metrics that account for both functional performance and efficiency.

### Significance

This research has the potential to significantly impact the field of machine learning by:

- **Streamlining Model Selection**: Providing an efficient method for selecting pre-trained models from large repositories, reducing redundant training and computational costs.
- **Enhancing Transfer Learning**: Facilitating more effective transfer learning by identifying models that best match the target task.
- **Promoting Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Encouraging collaboration between researchers in machine learning, computer vision, and other domains that rely on neural network models.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The dataset for this research will consist of a large collection of pre-trained neural network models from repositories such as Hugging Face. The models will be diverse in terms of architecture, task, and hyperparameters to ensure that the proposed method can generalize across various scenarios.

### Algorithmic Steps

The proposed method involves the following steps:

1. **Weight Matrix Representation**: Each weight matrix of a neural network is represented as a graph structure, where nodes correspond to neurons and edges correspond to connections between neurons.
2. **Graph Neural Network (GNN) Encoder**: A shared GNN module is applied to the graph structure, with equivariant message passing to respect layer symmetries. This module captures the structural relationships and symmetries within the weight matrices.
3. **Contrastive Learning**: Positive pairs are derived from symmetry-preserving augmentations, such as permuted neurons and scaled filters. Negative pairs are selected from weights of functionally distinct models. The encoder is trained to minimize the contrastive loss, which measures the similarity between positive pairs and dissimilarity between negative pairs.
4. **Embedding Space**: The learned embeddings cluster models by task and capability, enabling k-NN retrieval of networks that best transfer to unseen datasets.

### Mathematical Formulation

Let $\mathbf{W}$ denote the weight matrix of a neural network layer, and $\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{W})$ be the graph representation of $\mathbf{W}$. The GNN encoder processes $\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{W})$ to produce an embedding $\mathbf{e} = \text{GNN}(\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{W}))$. The contrastive loss $\mathcal{L}$ is defined as:

\[
\mathcal{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \left[ y_{ij} \cdot \text{sim}(\mathbf{e}_i, \mathbf{e}_j) + (1 - y_{ij}) \cdot \text{max}(0, m - \text{sim}(\mathbf{e}_i, \mathbf{e}_j)) \right]
\]

where $N$ is the number of models, $y_{ij}$ is the label indicating whether $\mathbf{e}_i$ and $\mathbf{e}_j$ are a positive pair (1) or a negative pair (0), and $m$ is the margin for the contrastive loss.

### Experimental Design

To validate the proposed method, we will evaluate its performance on a diverse set of tasks and datasets. The evaluation metrics will include:

1. **Retrieval Precision**: The proportion of retrieved models that are relevant to the target task.
2. **Clustering Coherence**: The degree to which the learned embeddings cluster models by task and capability.
3. **Downstream Fine-Tuning Efficiency**: The time and computational resources required to fine-tune the retrieved models on the target task.

The experimental setup will involve:

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Comparing the proposed method with existing model selection methods based on metadata.
2. **Robustness Analysis**: Evaluating the method's performance on different datasets and architectures to ensure its generalization.
3. **Scalability Testing**: Assessing the method's scalability by testing it on increasingly larger model repositories.
