## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **PEACE: Permutation-Equivariant Architecture Contrastive Embeddings for Efficient Neural Network Retrieval in Large Model Zoos**

**2. Introduction**

*   **Background:**
    The landscape of machine learning is increasingly characterized by the availability of vast repositories of pre-trained neural networks, often referred to as "model zoos." Platforms like Hugging Face now host over a million models, representing a colossal collective investment in computational resources and human effort. However, navigating these repositories to find models suitable for new tasks or specific research questions remains a significant challenge. Current search methods predominantly rely on metadata (e.g., task descriptions, dataset names, user tags), which often fails to capture the nuanced functional similarities or differences encoded within the models' weights. This limitation leads to inefficient model selection, redundant training efforts, and hampered progress in leveraging existing knowledge.

    The "Workshop on Neural Network Weights as a New Data Modality" highlights a critical need to shift our perspective: viewing the parameters (weights and biases) of neural networks not just as internal components optimized for a specific task, but as a rich data modality in themselves. The weight space, though high-dimensional and complex, potentially encodes valuable information about a model's architecture, training history, learned representations, and functional capabilities (Eilertsen et al., 2020; Survey 2024). Understanding and harnessing this information is key to unlocking the full potential of large model zoos.

    A fundamental challenge in analyzing weight spaces is their inherent symmetries. For instance, neurons within a layer of many common architectures (like MLPs and CNNs) can often be permuted, and weights can be scaled appropriately in adjacent layers, without altering the network's input-output function. These symmetries mean that functionally identical models can reside at vastly different locations in the raw weight space, rendering simple distance metrics (like Euclidean or cosine distance on flattened weight vectors) ineffective for comparing functional similarity. Therefore, methods designed to operate on weights must inherently respect these symmetries (Erdogan, 2025; Hypothetical Papers 7, 9).

    Recent work has begun exploring Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for weight analysis (Hypothetical Paper 8) and contrastive learning techniques to learn meaningful weight representations (Hypothetical Papers 6, 10). GNNs offer a natural framework for processing the relational structure within network layers, potentially capturing connectivity patterns and respecting permutation symmetries (Pei et al., 2020). Contrastive learning provides a powerful self-supervised paradigm for learning embeddings where similar items are pulled together and dissimilar items are pushed apart, making it well-suited for learning functionally relevant representations from unlabeled data (i.e., model weights).

*   **Research Objectives:**
    This research aims to develop a novel framework, **PEACE (Permutation-Equivariant Architecture Contrastive Embeddings)**, for learning compact, informative, and symmetry-aware embeddings of neural network weights to enable efficient and effective retrieval of functionally similar models from large zoos. Our primary objectives are:

    1.  **Develop a Permutation-Equivariant Weight Encoder:** Design and implement a neural network architecture, leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), that processes the weight tensors of a neural network and produces a fixed-size embedding for each layer, while respecting the permutation and scaling symmetries inherent in neuron arrangements and weight magnitudes.
    2.  **Formulate A Symmetry-Aware Contrastive Learning Strategy:** Define and implement a contrastive learning objective specifically tailored for weight space. This involves developing robust methods for generating positive pairs (via symmetry-preserving augmentations like neuron permutation and scaling) and selecting informative negative pairs (models with distinct functional characteristics).
    3.  **Learn Discriminative Network-Level Embeddings:** Aggregate layer-level equivariant embeddings into a single network-level embedding that captures the overall functional profile of the model, facilitating efficient similarity search (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors) in the embedding space.
    4.  **Empirically Validate the Framework:** Rigorously evaluate the PEACE framework on diverse model zoos across different tasks (e.g., image classification, natural language processing) and architectures (e.g., CNNs, Transformers). Validation will focus on retrieval effectiveness (precision, recall) and the utility of retrieved models for downstream transfer learning tasks.

*   **Significance:**
    This research directly addresses several key questions and challenges outlined by the workshop. By treating weights as a primary data modality and developing symmetry-aware representations, we aim to:
    *   **Enhance Model Discovery:** Provide practitioners with a powerful tool to efficiently search massive model zoos based on functional similarity, significantly reducing the time and resources spent on finding suitable pre-trained models.
    *   **Promote Sustainable AI:** Reduce redundant training and computational waste by facilitating effective reuse of existing models through improved transfer learning pipelines.
    *   **Advance Weight Space Understanding:** Contribute to the fundamental understanding of neural network weight spaces, particularly the role of symmetries and how functional properties are encoded in parameters. We aim to create representations that map functionally equivalent models (under permutation/scaling) to nearby points in the embedding space.
    *   **Bridge Research Areas:** Connect insights from equivariant deep learning (specifically GNNs), contrastive representation learning, and the emerging field of model zoo analysis, fostering cross-pollination of ideas.
    *   **Democratize Model Reuse:** Make large model repositories more accessible and useful, enabling researchers and engineers, potentially even those with limited computational resources, to leverage the collective knowledge embedded within pre-trained models more effectively.

**3. Methodology**

Our proposed methodology integrates three key components: representing network layers as graphs, processing these graphs with a permutation-equivariant encoder, and training this encoder via a contrastive learning objective sensitive to weight space symmetries.

*   **Data Collection and Preparation:**
    1.  **Model Zoo Curation:** We will assemble a diverse model zoo comprising pre-trained neural networks sourced from public repositories like Hugging Face Hub, PyTorch Hub, and potentially training custom models to ensure variety. The zoo will include:
        *   **Architectures:** Standard CNNs (e.g., ResNet variants, VGG), Vision Transformers (ViT variants), MLPs, potentially NLP models (e.g., BERT variants, if compute allows adaptation).
        *   **Tasks:** Primarily image classification (e.g., models trained on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k) and potentially NLP tasks (e.g., GLUE benchmark tasks).
        *   **Training Variations:** Models trained on the same task/architecture but with different hyperparameters (learning rates, optimizers, epochs), random seeds, or slightly different training datasets (e.g., subsets). This variation is crucial for defining nuanced positive/negative pairs later.
    2.  **Weight Extraction:** We will extract the weight tensors (kernel weights, biases) for each layer of the selected models. Layer normalization parameters (gain, bias) will also be considered part of the layer's parameters.
    3.  **Metadata Association:** We will retain associated metadata for each model (e.g., task, dataset, reported performance metrics, architecture type) for evaluation and potential weak supervision.

*   **Permutation-Equivariant Weight Encoder:**
    We propose a hierarchical encoder comprising a layer-level equivariant GNN module followed by a network-level aggregation module.

    1.  **Layer-Level Graph Representation:** Each parametric layer $l$ (e.g., Fully Connected, Convolutional) within a network $w$ will be processed. We treat neurons (or filters/channels in CNNs) as the fundamental units subject to permutation.
        *   **Fully Connected Layer ($W^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_{out} \times n_{in}}$, $b^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_{out}}$):** Represent this layer potentially as a bipartite graph between $n_{in}$ input nodes and $n_{out}$ output nodes, with edges weighted by $W_{ij}^{(l)}$. Alternatively, and perhaps more directly for equivariance, we consider $n_{out}$ nodes, where each node $i$ corresponds to the $i$-th output neuron. The initial feature vector $h_i^{(0)}$ for node $i$ could incorporate the bias $b_i^{(l)}$ and statistics of the incoming weights (row $i$ of $W^{(l)}$). The GNN message passing will operate over these nodes, implicitly considering the connections defined by $W^{(l)}$.
        *   **Convolutional Layer ($K^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{C_{out} \times C_{in} \times k \times k}$, $b^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{C_{out}}$):** Represent this layer with $C_{out}$ nodes, corresponding to the output channels/filters. The initial feature $h_i^{(0)}$ for node $i$ (output channel $i$) could be derived from the bias $b_i^{(l)}$ and the corresponding filter weights (the $i$-th slice of $K^{(l)}$ across the $C_{in}$ dimension). The GNN would operate on these $C_{out}$ nodes.

    2.  **Equivariant GNN Module ($E^{(l)} = \text{GNN}_{layer}(W^{(l)}, b^{(l)})$):**
        We will use a GNN architecture capable of processing these layer representations while respecting permutation symmetry. Let $\Pi_{out}$ be the set of permutation matrices acting on the output neurons/channels of layer $l$, and $\Pi_{in}$ act on the input neurons/channels. Functionally equivalent transformations often involve $W' = \pi_{out} W \pi_{in}^T$, $b' = \pi_{out} b$ (for FC/Conv) and $W_{next}' = W_{next} \pi_{out}^T$ (for the subsequent layer). Our GNN must handle the output permutation $\pi_{out}$.
        *   **Architecture:** We will adapt GNN architectures known for permutation equivariance or invariance. We can use message-passing GNNs where node features are updated based on aggregated messages from neighbors. To ensure equivariance to output neuron permutation $\pi_{out}$, the GNN operations must commute with $\pi_{out}$. We can achieve permutation *invariance* for the layer embedding $E^{(l)}$ by applying a permutation-invariant aggregation (e.g., sum, mean, max pooling) over the final node embeddings produced by the GNN for that layer:
            $$ H^{(L)}_i = \text{GNN-NodeEmbed}(W^{(l)}, b^{(l)})_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{node}} $$
            $$ E^{(l)} = \text{Aggregate}_{i=1}^{n_{out}}(H^{(L)}_i) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{layer}} $$
            This aggregated embedding $E^{(l)}$ will be invariant to the permutation of output neurons within layer $l$. Handling the interaction with $\pi_{in}$ and scaling requires careful design, possibly through weight normalization incorporated into the GNN features or operations designed to be scale-invariant (inspired by Erdogan, 2025; Hypothetical Paper 9). We might explore architectures like Deep Sets or Graph Attention Networks (GAT) adapted for this structure. Feature expansion techniques (Sun et al., 2023) might be needed to ensure rich representations.
        *   **Handling Different Layer Types:** We might use different GNN parameters for different layer types (FC, Conv2d) or employ a universal GNN module capable of handling varying input structures.

    3.  **Network-Level Aggregation ($E_{net} = \text{Aggregate}_{network}(\{E^{(l)}\}_{l=1}^L)$):**
        The sequence of layer embeddings $\{E^{(l)}\}_{l=1}^L$ needs to be aggregated into a single network embedding $E_{net} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{embed}}$.
        *   **Approach:** We propose using a Transformer encoder over the sequence of layer embeddings. Positional encodings will be added to the layer embeddings $E^{(l)}$ to retain sequence information. The Transformer's self-attention mechanism can capture long-range dependencies and interactions between layers. The final network embedding $E_{net}$ can be derived from the Transformer's output (e.g., pooling the output sequence or using the embedding of a special [CLS] token).

*   **Contrastive Learning Framework:**
    We will train the encoder end-to-end using a contrastive loss function, specifically the NT-Xent (InfoNCE) loss, to learn discriminative embeddings.
    $$ \mathcal{L} = -\mathbb{E}_{w_i \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(f(w_i), f(w_i^+)) / \tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(f(w_i), f(w_i^+)) / \tau) + \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} \exp(\text{sim}(f(w_i), f(w_j^-)) / \tau)} \right] $$
    where $f$ is the full encoder (GNN + Aggregation), $\text{sim}(u, v) = u^T v / (\|u\| \|v\|)$ is cosine similarity, $\tau$ is a temperature hyperparameter, $w_i$ is an anchor model, $w_i^+$ is a positive example, and $\{w_j^-\}$ are negative examples.

    1.  **Positive Pair Generation ($w_i, w_i^+$):** Positive pairs should represent functionally equivalent or highly similar models. We generate $w_i^+$ from $w_i$ using symmetry-preserving augmentations:
        *   **Neuron Permutation:** Apply valid random permutations $\pi_{out}, \pi_{in}$ to the weights and biases of compatible layers (e.g., permute neurons in an FC layer and adjust adjacent layers accordingly).
        *   **Weight Scaling:** Apply valid scaling transformations (e.g., scale weights/biases of a layer and inversely scale weights of the subsequent layer, respecting activation function constraints like ReLU).
        *   **Near-Duplicate Models:** Consider models trained with identical hyperparameters but different random seeds as positive pairs, assuming they converge to functionally similar solutions.
        *   **Small Weight Perturbations:** Potentially add small Gaussian noise to weights, assuming this preserves function locally.

    2.  **Negative Pair Selection ($w_i, w_j^-$):** Negative pairs should represent functionally distinct models. We will sample negatives strategically:
        *   **Different Tasks:** Models trained on fundamentally different tasks (e.g., ImageNet classification vs. CIFAR-10 classification, or Image Classification vs. NLP).
        *   **Different Architectures:** Models with significantly different architectures trained on the same task.
        *   **Different Performance Levels:** Models trained on the same task/architecture but achieving vastly different performance levels (suggesting different functional solutions).
        *   **Hard Negatives:** Models that are superficially similar (e.g., same architecture, same task) but known to have different functional properties (e.g., one robust, one non-robust; one backdoored, one clean). (Addresses Challenge 3).

    3.  **Weak Supervision (Optional Extension):** We may explore incorporating model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy on a held-out validation set) as a weak supervisory signal, potentially by weighting pairs in the contrastive loss based on performance similarity or adding an auxiliary prediction task.

*   **Experimental Design & Validation:**
    We will conduct a comprehensive evaluation to assess the effectiveness of PEACE.

    1.  **Baselines:** We will compare PEACE against several baseline methods for model retrieval:
        *   **Metadata Search:** Keyword-based search on model descriptions/tags (simulating current practice).
        *   **Naive Weight Similarity:** Cosine similarity between flattened, concatenated weight vectors.
        *   **Simple Encoder Baselines:** MLP or Autoencoder applied to flattened weights (non-equivariant).
        *   **Existing Methods (Conceptual):** If possible, reimplementations or conceptual comparisons based on cited works like Eilertsen et al. (2020) or the hypothetical contrastive/invariant methods (Papers 6, 7, 10).

    2.  **Evaluation Tasks:**
        *   **Task 1: Model Retrieval:**
            *   *Setup:* Use a model $w_q$ (or a description of its task/performance) as a query. Retrieve the top-k models from the curated zoo using k-NN search in the learned embedding space ($E_{net}$).
            *   *Ground Truth:* Define relevance based on functional similarity. This could be: models trained on the exact same task, models trained on highly related tasks known to transfer well, or models achieving similar performance profiles on a suite of diagnostic tests. Curation of this ground truth is a key sub-task.
            *   *Metrics:* Precision@k, Recall@k, Mean Average Precision (MAP).
        *   **Task 2: Transfer Learning Performance:**
            *   *Setup:* Select target tasks/datasets not present or under-represented in the initial training of the zoo models. Use PEACE (and baselines) to retrieve the top-k models from the zoo perceived as most suitable for the target task. Fine-tune these retrieved models on the target task.
            *   *Metrics:* Measure the final performance (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) on the target task. Evaluate the *efficiency* of transfer (e.g., performance achieved after a fixed number of fine-tuning steps/epochs, or time/compute to reach a target performance level). Compare against fine-tuning randomly selected models or models retrieved by baselines.
        *   **Task 3: Embedding Space Analysis:**
            *   *Setup:* Visualize the learned embedding space $E_{net}$ using dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, UMAP). Color points by known metadata (task, architecture, dataset, performance bracket).
            *   *Metrics:* Quantify clustering quality using metrics like Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index. Assess if functionally equivalent models (e.g., original vs. permuted/scaled versions) map to the same point or very close points. (Addresses Challenge 1 & 5).

    3.  **Ablation Studies:** Analyze the contribution of key components: permutation equivariance in the GNN, the specific contrastive sampling strategy, the network aggregation mechanism (Transformer vs. simpler pooling), and the impact of different symmetry augmentations.

    4.  **Scalability Analysis:** Measure the time required for embedding generation and retrieval queries as the model zoo size increases. Compare against baselines. (Addresses Challenge 2).

    5.  **Generalization Across Architectures:** Explicitly test the ability of a single trained PEACE encoder to embed and retrieve models from architectures not seen or under-represented during its training phase. (Addresses Challenge 4).

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

*   **Expected Outcomes:**
    1.  **A Novel Equivariant Encoder (PEACE):** A functional implementation of the proposed permutation-equivariant GNN-based encoder for neural network weights.
    2.  **High-Quality Weight Embeddings:** A robust method producing low-dimensional embeddings that demonstrably capture functional similarity while being invariant/robust to weight space symmetries (permutation, scaling).
    3.  **Superior Retrieval Performance:** Quantitative results showing significantly improved Precision@k, Recall@k, and MAP for model retrieval compared to metadata-based and non-equivariant baselines.
    4.  **Enhanced Transfer Learning Efficiency:** Empirical evidence demonstrating that models retrieved using PEACE lead to better performance and/or faster convergence when fine-tuned on downstream tasks, compared to baseline retrieval methods.
    5.  **Structured Embedding Space:** Visualizations and quantitative analysis revealing a well-structured embedding space where models cluster meaningfully by task, functionality, and potentially architecture. Functionally identical models (under symmetry transformations) should map to nearly identical embeddings.
    6.  **Open-Source Contribution:** Release of code and potentially pre-computed embeddings for standard model sets to facilitate further research and adoption by the community.

*   **Impact:**
    This research is poised to make significant contributions to the burgeoning field of weight space analysis and its practical applications.
    *   **Scientific Impact:** We will provide concrete methods and empirical evidence for treating neural network weights as a structured data modality, emphasizing the critical role of symmetries. This work will advance the understanding of how function is encoded in weights and offer new tools for comparative model analysis. It aims to solidify the bridge between equivariant deep learning, contrastive learning, and large-scale model analysis, potentially inspiring new theoretical inquiries into weight space geometry and expressivity (as mentioned in the workshop call).
    *   **Practical Impact:** The PEACE framework promises a tangible improvement in how practitioners interact with large model zoos. By enabling efficient, function-based retrieval, it can drastically reduce the computational cost and human effort associated with model selection for transfer learning, fine-tuning, and model comparison. This can accelerate research and development cycles across various AI domains.
    *   **Broader Impact:** By promoting the reuse of existing models, this work contributes to more sustainable AI practices, mitigating the ever-growing computational footprint of training large models from scratch. Democratizing access to relevant pre-trained models empowers a wider range of researchers and institutions. Furthermore, the ability to analyze functional similarity directly from weights could open doors to new applications in model debugging, robustness analysis (e.g., detecting functionally anomalous models), understanding model lineage, and perhaps even novel forms of neural architecture search driven by desired functional embeddings.
