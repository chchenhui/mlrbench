# Privacy-Preserving Medical Foundation Models via Federated Learning

## Motivation
Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) promise to revolutionize healthcare by providing AI-driven assistance, but they face critical challenges regarding patient privacy. Medical data is highly sensitive and protected by strict regulations like HIPAA, making centralized model training problematic. Additionally, healthcare institutions are often reluctant to share patient data due to privacy concerns and competitive considerations. There is an urgent need for approaches that can leverage distributed medical datasets while ensuring patient privacy, maintaining data ownership, and complying with regulations.

## Main Idea
This research proposes a federated learning framework specifically designed for training Medical Foundation Models across distributed healthcare institutions without sharing raw patient data. Our approach implements a hierarchical federated learning architecture where local models are trained on institution-specific data, and only model updates (not raw data) are aggregated centrally. We'll incorporate differential privacy techniques to add calibrated noise to model updates, preventing patient re-identification while maintaining model utility. Additionally, we'll develop domain-specific federated optimization algorithms that address the non-IID nature of medical data across institutions with varying patient populations and equipment. This framework will enable collaborative development of powerful MFMs while preserving patient privacy, facilitating adoption in privacy-sensitive healthcare environments, and potentially accelerating the development of clinically viable AI assistants.
