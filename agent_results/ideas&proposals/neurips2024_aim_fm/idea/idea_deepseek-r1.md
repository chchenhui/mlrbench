**Title:** Robust Medical Foundation Models for Low-Resource Diagnosis via Few-Shot Multimodal Learning  

**Motivation:** In rural and developing regions, medical data scarcity and misalignment across modalities (e.g., incomplete lab results or imaging) hinder the reliability of AI-driven diagnoses. Current MFMs often require large, high-quality datasets for training, which are unavailable in resource-constrained settings, exacerbating healthcare disparities.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a robust MFM framework combining few-shot learning and self-supervised multimodal alignment to address data scarcity. The model will leverage cross-modal pretraining on diverse public datasets (e.g., paired radiology reports and images) to learn generalized representations. For adaptation to local settings, a parameter-efficient tuning mechanism (e.g., low-rank adapters) will align sparse, heterogeneous data (e.g., partial lab tests and X-rays) without catastrophic forgetting. Uncertainty quantification modules will flag low-confidence predictions, prompting human-AI collaboration. Expected outcomes include a validated MFM achieving >85% diagnostic accuracy on benchmarks simulating low-resource scenarios (e.g., missing modalities, small samples). This approach could democratize access to reliable AI diagnostics in underserved areas, reducing reliance on large annotated datasets and improving trust via transparent uncertainty estimates.
