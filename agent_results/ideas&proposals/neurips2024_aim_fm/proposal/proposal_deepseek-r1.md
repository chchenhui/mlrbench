**Research Proposal: Causal Reasoning Meets Explainable Medical Foundation Models**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Medical foundation models (MFMs) have emerged as transformative tools in healthcare, offering capabilities ranging from automated diagnosis to personalized treatment recommendations. However, their adoption in clinical settings remains limited due to their inherent "black-box" nature. Clinicians require transparent, interpretable decision-making processes to trust AI systems, particularly in high-stakes scenarios such as cancer diagnosis or drug prescription. Current explainability methods, such as attention maps or saliency visualizations, often highlight associative patterns rather than causal relationships, leading to unreliable or misleading explanations. For instance, a model might correlate a patient’s age with a disease outcome without capturing the underlying causal mechanism (e.g., age-related biological changes). This gap undermines trust, complicates regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI Act), and limits the clinical utility of MFMs.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research proposes **Causal-MFM**, a framework that integrates causal reasoning into MFMs to generate interpretable, action-aware explanations. The objectives are:  
1. **Causal Discovery**: Identify causal relationships in multimodal medical data (imaging, lab results, EHRs) using domain-specific constraints.  
2. **Causal Explanation**: Develop a module that maps model decisions to causal mechanisms, enabling counterfactual reasoning (e.g., "If liver enzymes were normal, the treatment recommendation would change").  
3. **Validation**: Evaluate the framework’s clinical utility through collaboration with healthcare professionals, focusing on explanation clarity, robustness, and alignment with medical reasoning.  

**Significance**  
By embedding causal reasoning into MFMs, this work aims to bridge the trust gap between clinicians and AI systems. The outcomes will advance regulatory compliance, enable audit-ready AI tools, and improve patient outcomes through reliable, interpretable decision support.

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### **2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
- **Data Sources**: Multimodal datasets including:  
  - **Imaging**: Chest X-rays (MIMIC-CXR), MRI scans (BraTS).  
  - **Text**: Radiology reports (MIMIC-III), clinical notes.  
  - **Structured Data**: EHRs with lab results, medications, and patient demographics.  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - **Imaging**: Normalize pixel values, augment with rotations/flips.  
  - **Text**: Extract entities (symptoms, diagnoses) using BioBERT.  
  - **Structured Data**: Handle missing values via MICE imputation, standardize units.  

#### **2.2 Causal Discovery**  
We employ a hybrid causal discovery approach combining constraint-based algorithms and domain knowledge:  
1. **Constraint-Based Learning**: Use the PC algorithm to infer causal graphs from observational data, enforcing medical constraints (e.g., "smoking cannot be caused by lung cancer").  
2. **Structural Equation Models (SEMs)**: Represent causal relationships as:  
   $$  
   X_j = f_j(\mathbf{PA}(X_j), U_j),  
   $$  
   where $\mathbf{PA}(X_j)$ denotes parents of variable $X_j$, and $U_j$ is noise.  
3. **Integration with Attention**: Adapt the CInA framework to align transformer attention weights with causal pathways, enabling zero-shot causal inference (Figure 1).  

#### **2.3 Causal Explanation Module**  
The module generates explanations via counterfactual reasoning and causal Bayesian networks:  
1. **Counterfactual Queries**: For a patient with features $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x}$, compute the counterfactual outcome under intervention $do(X_i = x')$:  
   $$  
   Y_{\text{CF}} = Y(do(X_i = x'), \mathbf{U} = \mathbf{u}).  
   $$  
   This answers questions like, "Would the patient’s prognosis improve if their blood pressure were lowered?"  
2. **Explanation Generation**: Convert causal subgraphs into natural language using template-based generation (e.g., "Elevated creatinine levels (cause) indicate renal dysfunction (effect), justifying dialysis (action)").  

#### **2.4 Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against attention-based explainability (Grad-CAM) and associative methods (LIME).  
- **Tasks**:  
  - **Radiology Report Generation**: Generate reports from chest X-rays, with explanations linking image features to diagnoses.  
  - **EHR-Based Prognosis**: Predict 30-day mortality using MIMIC-III, with causal explanations for risk factors.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Explanation Relevance**: Clinician surveys (5-point Likert scale) assessing clarity and actionability.  
  - **Faithfulness**: Ablation tests measuring prediction change when causal features are perturbed.  
  - **Robustness**: Performance on out-of-distribution data (e.g., rural vs. urban patient cohorts).  
  - **Accuracy**: AUROC, F1-score for prognosis/diagnosis tasks.  

#### **2.5 Implementation Details**  
- **Model Architecture**: Pretrain a multimodal transformer on medical data, then fine-tune with causal layers.  
- **Training**: Use counterfactual data augmentation to improve robustness.  
- **Tools**: PyTorch, CausalNex for Bayesian networks, DoWhy for causal inference.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes**  

1. **Improved Explanation Quality**: Clinician surveys will show higher ratings for Causal-MFM explanations compared to baselines (target: ≥4.0/5.0 relevance score).  
2. **Enhanced Robustness**: The framework will maintain AUROC >0.85 under covariate shifts (e.g., cross-hospital validation).  
3. **Benchmark Dataset**: Release a curated dataset with causal annotations for radiology and EHR tasks.  
4. **Theoretical Contributions**: A unified framework linking causal inference and explainable AI, formalized via structural causal models.

### 4. **Impact**  

This research will directly address the trust and transparency barriers hindering MFM adoption in healthcare. By providing causal explanations, clinicians can validate AI recommendations against domain knowledge, reducing diagnostic errors and enabling personalized interventions. The framework’s robustness ensures applicability in resource-limited settings, democratizing access to high-quality care. Long-term impacts include:  
- **Regulatory Advancements**: Compliance with explainability mandates (e.g., EU AI Act).  
- **Clinical Adoption**: Integration into hospital workflows via partnerships with healthcare providers.  
- **Research Community**: Open-source tools and benchmarks to accelerate causally-informed AI in medicine.

**Conclusion**  
Causal-MFM represents a paradigm shift in medical AI, prioritizing interpretability and causality over correlation. By aligning model reasoning with clinical expertise, this work paves the way for trustworthy, equitable, and life-saving AI systems in global healthcare.
