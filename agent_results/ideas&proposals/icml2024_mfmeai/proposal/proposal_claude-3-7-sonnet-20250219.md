# Fusing Multi-Modal Foundation Models with Hierarchical Control for Adaptive Embodied Agents

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have produced remarkable Multi-Modal Foundation Models (MFMs) like CLIP, GPT-4V, and Gemini, which demonstrate powerful capabilities in understanding and generating content across different modalities. These models excel at high-level semantic reasoning, interpreting visual scenes, and understanding natural language instructions. Simultaneously, the field of Embodied AI has progressed toward creating autonomous agents that can physically interact with their environments through perception and action.

Despite these parallel advancements, a critical gap exists between the rich semantic understanding provided by MFMs and the precise, low-level control mechanisms required for successful embodied interaction. Current embodied agents struggle to translate high-level perceptual insights into effective physical actions, particularly in open-ended, unstructured environments. This disconnect limits the practical deployment of robots and embodied agents in real-world settings where adaptability to novel scenarios is essential.

The integration of MFMs with embodied control systems represents a promising frontier for AI research. Prior work has demonstrated the potential of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) for decomposing complex tasks into manageable subtasks, as seen in systems like H2O2 (Avila Pires et al., 2023) and HIDIO (Zhang et al., 2021). Simultaneously, models like PaLM-E (Driess et al., 2023) have shown how language models can incorporate visual and embodied inputs. However, a comprehensive framework that effectively bridges the semantic understanding of MFMs with hierarchical control for embodied agents remains underdeveloped.

### Research Objectives

This research aims to develop and evaluate a novel hierarchical multi-modal architecture that seamlessly integrates the semantic understanding capabilities of MFMs with adaptive control mechanisms for embodied agents. Specifically, we seek to:

1. Design a two-tiered framework where an MFM provides semantic affordance maps and goal representations that inform a hierarchical reinforcement learning controller.

2. Develop training methodologies that leverage self-supervised exploration to bootstrap the hierarchical learning process with minimal human supervision.

3. Evaluate the architecture's performance in terms of sample efficiency, generalization to novel tasks, and transfer capability from simulation to real-world settings.

4. Analyze the interaction between the MFM and hierarchical controller components to understand how semantic information flows through the system and influences decision-making at different levels.

### Significance

This research addresses a fundamental challenge at the intersection of MFMs and Embodied AI: bridging high-level semantic understanding with precise low-level control. Our approach has the potential to significantly advance embodied agents' capabilities in several ways:

1. **Enhanced adaptability**: By leveraging MFMs' semantic understanding with hierarchical control, agents can better adapt to novel environments and tasks without extensive retraining.

2. **Improved sample efficiency**: The hierarchical structure and semantic grounding from MFMs should reduce the data requirements for learning effective policies in complex environments.

3. **Greater robustness**: The combination of high-level reasoning and specialized low-level controllers provides redundancy and flexibility in handling unexpected situations.

4. **Broader applicability**: The framework enables embodied agents to understand and act upon natural language instructions in open-ended environments, expanding their potential applications.

Successfully bridging the gap between MFMs and embodied control could accelerate progress toward creating versatile robots capable of assisting in homes, hospitals, and workplaces, where they must interact with diverse objects, follow complex instructions, and adapt to changing circumstances.

## 2. Methodology

### System Architecture

We propose a two-tiered hierarchical architecture that consists of the following components:

1. **Multi-Modal Foundation Model (MFM) Tier**: This tier processes raw sensory inputs and extracts high-level semantic information.
   
2. **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) Tier**: This tier consists of high-level policies for subgoal selection and low-level controllers for executing specific motor skills.

The overall architecture is illustrated in Figure 1 (diagram not included in text format).

#### MFM Tier

The MFM tier utilizes a frozen pre-trained multi-modal foundation model that processes multiple sensor streams:

- RGB images from cameras ($I_t^{RGB}$)
- Depth maps ($I_t^D$)
- Audio signals ($A_t$)
- Proprioceptive information ($P_t$)

These inputs are encoded using modality-specific encoders and projected into a shared embedding space. The MFM processes these embeddings to generate:

1. **Semantic Affordance Maps** ($\mathcal{A}_t$): These maps highlight regions in the visual field that afford specific actions (e.g., graspable objects, navigable paths).

2. **Goal Representations** ($\mathcal{G}_t$): These are semantic embeddings that capture the current task goals derived from environmental cues or explicit instructions.

Formally, the MFM processing can be represented as:

$$\mathcal{A}_t, \mathcal{G}_t = \text{MFM}(I_t^{RGB}, I_t^D, A_t, P_t)$$

The MFM remains frozen during training to preserve its general-purpose semantic understanding capabilities while enabling task-specific adaptations in the HRL tier.

#### HRL Tier

The HRL tier consists of two levels of policies:

1. **High-Level Policy** ($\pi_H$): This policy takes as input the semantic affordance maps and goal representations from the MFM tier, along with the current state ($s_t$), and outputs a subgoal ($g_t$) for the agent to achieve:

$$g_t = \pi_H(s_t, \mathcal{A}_t, \mathcal{G}_t)$$

Subgoals are represented in a latent space that captures both spatial information (where to act) and action semantics (what to accomplish).

2. **Low-Level Controllers** ($\{\pi_L^1, \pi_L^2, ..., \pi_L^K\}$): These are specialized controllers designed for specific motion primitives (e.g., grasping, navigation, pushing). Each controller takes the current state and the subgoal as inputs and produces low-level actions:

$$a_t = \pi_L^i(s_t, g_t)$$

The selection of the appropriate low-level controller is managed by a gating function ($G$) that evaluates the suitability of each controller for the current subgoal:

$$i = G(g_t, s_t) = \arg\max_j \phi_j(g_t, s_t)$$

where $\phi_j$ is a compatibility function that scores how well controller $j$ can achieve the subgoal $g_t$ from state $s_t$.

### Data Collection and Training Process

Our training methodology involves four main stages:

#### 1. MFM Adaptation

While the core MFM remains frozen, we train thin adaptation layers to map the MFM's general representations to task-specific affordance maps and goal embeddings. This adaptation uses a dataset $\mathcal{D}_{MFM}$ consisting of:

- Visual scenes with annotated affordances (e.g., graspable objects, surfaces)
- Task descriptions paired with goal states
- Demonstration trajectories showing successful task completions

The adaptation layers are trained using a combination of supervised learning objectives:

$$\mathcal{L}_{MFM} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{affordance} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{goal} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{alignment}$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{affordance}$ is a pixel-wise classification loss for affordance prediction, $\mathcal{L}_{goal}$ is a contrastive loss for aligning goal representations with task descriptions, and $\mathcal{L}_{alignment}$ ensures consistency between affordance predictions and goal representations.

#### 2. Low-Level Controller Training

Each low-level controller $\pi_L^i$ is trained to execute specific motion primitives through a combination of:

1. **Imitation Learning**: Using demonstration data $\mathcal{D}_{demo}^i$ for each skill:

$$\mathcal{L}_{IL}^i = \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, g_t, a_t) \sim \mathcal{D}_{demo}^i} \left[ \| \pi_L^i(s_t, g_t) - a_t \|^2 \right]$$

2. **Reinforcement Learning**: Using a reward function $r_i(s_t, a_t, g_t)$ that captures how well the action contributes to achieving the subgoal:

$$\mathcal{L}_{RL}^i = -\mathbb{E}_{(s_t, g_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) \sim \mathcal{T}} \left[ Q^i(s_t, g_t, a_t) \right]$$

where $Q^i$ is the action-value function for controller $i$, and $\mathcal{T}$ represents trajectories collected through environmental interaction.

#### 3. High-Level Policy Training

The high-level policy $\pi_H$ is trained through hierarchical reinforcement learning, where the reward is based on the overall task completion:

$$\mathcal{L}_H = -\mathbb{E}_{(s_t, \mathcal{A}_t, \mathcal{G}_t, g_t, R_t) \sim \mathcal{T}} \left[ Q_H(s_t, \mathcal{A}_t, \mathcal{G}_t, g_t) \right]$$

where $Q_H$ is the high-level action-value function, and $R_t$ is the cumulative reward for the entire episode.

We implement this using Hierarchical Hindsight Experience Replay (HHER), an extension of HER that relabels subgoals and task goals to enable learning from failed attempts.

#### 4. Self-Supervised Exploration

To enhance sample efficiency and bootstrap learning with minimal human supervision, we employ a self-supervised exploration mechanism:

1. The MFM generates pseudo-instructions and affordances for novel scenes.
2. The agent autonomously explores the environment guided by these pseudo-annotations.
3. Successful trajectories are added to the training data for further refinement.

The exploration uses intrinsic motivation signals based on:
- Novelty of states: $r_{novelty}(s_t) = 1 - \max_{s \in \mathcal{S}_{visited}} \text{sim}(s_t, s)$
- Uncertainty in affordance predictions: $r_{uncertainty}(s_t) = H(\mathcal{A}_t)$ (entropy of affordance distribution)
- Achievement of predicted affordances: $r_{achievement}(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) = \text{increase in affordance probability}$

### Experimental Design and Evaluation

We evaluate our framework in three increasingly challenging settings:

#### 1. Simulated Environment Evaluation

We use the AI2-THOR and Habitat simulators with a diverse set of tasks:
- Object manipulation (picking, placing, opening)
- Navigation to described locations
- Multi-step tasks combining navigation and manipulation

Performance metrics include:
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of tasks successfully completed
- **Efficiency**: Number of actions required to complete tasks
- **Generalization**: Performance on novel objects and environments

We compare our approach against baselines:

- Hierarchical RL without MFM guidance
- MFM-based approaches without hierarchical control

#### 2. Sim-to-Real Transfer Evaluation

We assess the transfer capabilities by deploying trained policies on a physical robot (e.g., Franka Emika or LoCoBot) with:
- Reality gap mitigation through domain randomization during training
- Progressive transfer from simulation to reality
- Fine-tuning of specific components in real-world settings

Metrics include:
- **Transfer Success Rate**: Success rate drop from simulation to reality
- **Adaptation Speed**: Number of real-world interactions needed for successful adaptation
- **Robustness**: Performance under varying lighting, positioning, and object appearances

#### 3. Long-Horizon Task Evaluation

We evaluate the system on complex, long-horizon tasks that require:
- Multi-step planning
- Adapting to changing conditions
- Understanding abstract goals (e.g., "prepare breakfast")

Metrics focus on:
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of complex tasks completed
- **Recovery Ability**: Success in recovering from failures or unexpected outcomes
- **Instruction Following**: Alignment between natural language instructions and agent behavior
