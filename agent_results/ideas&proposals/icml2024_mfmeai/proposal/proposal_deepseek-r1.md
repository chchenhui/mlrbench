**Hierarchical Multi-Modal Controller for Embodied Agents: Bridging Semantics and Control in Open-Ended Environments**  

---

### 1. Introduction  
**Background**  
Embodied AI agents require seamless integration of high-level semantic understanding and precise low-level control for success in open-ended environments. Multi-modal foundation models (MFMs) like CLIP, GPT-4V, and PaLM-E excel at cross-modal reasoning but struggle to translate their outputs into action sequences for physical systems. Current methods often either use frozen MFMs as perception modules or fine-tune them end-to-end for tasks like manipulation, leading to inefficient control policies and poor generalization (Driess et al., 2023). Meanwhile, hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) frameworks such as H2O2 (Avila Pires et al., 2023) and HIDIO (Zhang et al., 2021) decompose tasks into subgoals but lack the semantic grounding provided by MFMs. This gap limits agents in balancing abstract reasoning (e.g., "retrieve the misplaced medication") with low-level motor skills (e.g., avoiding obstacles while reaching a drawer).  

**Research Objectives**  
This work addresses four objectives:  
1. **Bridging Semantics and Control**: Develop a hierarchical architecture that converts MFM-derived semantic affordances into parametrized motion primitives.  
2. **Sample-Efficient Learning**: Train high- and low-level policies via self-supervised exploration in simulation, using MFM-generated pseudo-labels.  
3. **Generalization**: Enable transfer to unseen tasks through modular subgoals and disentangled representation learning.  
4. **Real-World Transfer**: Validate the framework on physical robots in cluttered home environments, proposing techniques to mitigate the simulation-to-reality gap.  

**Significance**  
The proposed framework builds on advancements in MFMs and HRL to tackle critical challenges in Embodied AI. Success would enable robots to perform complex tasks like "organize kitchen utensils" without task-specific retraining, advancing applications in domestic assistance and industrial automation. By formally linking semantic reasoning with motion planning, this work also contributes theoretical insights into grounded AI systems in partially observable 3D environments.

### 2. Methodology  
**2.1 System Architecture**  
We propose a two-tiered architecture (Fig. 1):  
- **Semantic Planner (MFM Tier)**: A frozen MFM (CLIP/ViT-H + GPT-4V text encoder) processes raw RGB-D, audio, and proprioception to generate:  
  - *Affordance Maps*: Spatial probability distributions over interactable objects, $A_t = \text{MFM}(I_t)[x,y,c]$, where $c \in \{\text{graspable}, \text{navigable}, ...\}$.  
  - *Goal Representation*: A task embedding $G = \text{MFM}(\text{"Instruction: "} + q)$, where $q$ is a natural language query.  
- **Hierarchical Controller (HRL Tier)**:  
  - *High-Level Policy* ($\pi^{HL}$): A transformer-based policy that selects subgoals (e.g., $\text{move\_to}(x,y,z)$) using state $s_t^{HL} = [A_t, G, H_{t-1}^{LL}]$, where $H_{t-1}^{LL}$ is the low-level hidden state.  
  - *Low-Level Controllers* ($\pi^{LL}_k$): Specialized Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agents for motion primitives (grasping, pushing), taking continuous actions $a_t^{LL} \in \mathbb{R}^d$.  

**2.2 Training Framework**  
**Phase 1: Self-Supervised Pre-Training**  
- **MFM Pseudo-Label Generation**: In Habitat and SAPIEN simulators, execute random interactions (e.g., "open drawer") and use CLIP to auto-generate task descriptions (e.g., $q_{\text{pseudo}} = \text{argmax}_q \langle \text{MFM}(I_t), q \rangle$).  
- **Low-Level Skill Training**: Train $\pi^{LL}_k$ via RL with shaped rewards:  
  $$r^{LL}_t = \underbrace{\beta_1 \cdot \mathbb{I}(\text{skill success})}_{\text{task reward}} + \underbrace{\beta_2 \cdot \|a_t - a^{\text{DEMO}}_t\|^{-1}}_{\text{imitation term}} + \underbrace{\beta_3 \cdot \text{JS}(A_t, A^{\text{GT}}_t)}_{\text{affordance matching}}$$  
  Pre-trained skills are stored in a motion library indexed by skill type and object class.  

**Phase 2: Joint HRL Training**  
- **High-Level RL**: Train $\pi^{HL}$ to select subgoals using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with reward:  
  $$r^{HL}_t = \alpha_1 \cdot \mathbb{I}(\text{subgoal reached}) + \alpha_2 \cdot e^{-T_{\text{subgoal}} / \tau} + \alpha_3 \cdot \text{KL}(G_{\text{curr}} \| G_{\text{target}})$$  
  where $T_{\text{subgoal}}$ is the time taken, and $G$ embeddings are aligned via contrastive learning.  
- **Curriculum Learning**: Start with single-skill tasks (e.g., "pick up cup"), gradually increasing complexity to multi-step tasks like "place bottle in recycling bin after opening drawer."  

**2.3 Experimental Design**  
**Simulation Benchmarks**  
- **ALFRED**: Evaluate on 100+ household tasks requiring vision-language grounding and sequential actions.  
- **Habitat 3.0**: Test navigation-manipulation in photorealistic apartments under partial observability.  
- **Custom Simulator**: Implement a Unity-based environment with procedurally generated object layouts and failure modes (e.g., slippery surfaces).  

**Baselines**  
1. **PaLM-E (Driess et al., 2023)**: End-to-end MFM fine-tuning.  
2. **H2O2 (Avila Pires et al., 2023)**: State-of-the-art HRL without MFM grounding.  
3. **BC-Z (Jang et al., 2022)**: Imitation learning with MFM features.  

**Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Task Success Rate (TSR)**: % of tasks fully completed.  
- **Sample Efficiency**: Episodes required to reach 80% TSR.  
- **Generalization Score**: Performance on 30 held-out tasks with novel object combinations.  
- **Affordance Accuracy**: IoU between predicted and ground-truth affordance maps.  

**Real-World Validation**  
Deploy on Toyota HSR and Boston Dynamics Spot robots in 10 home environments, testing tasks like "Find my keys and place them near the laptop." Use domain randomization during training (varying lighting, textures) to bridge the sim-to-real gap.

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Task Performance**: Anticipate 25–40% higher TSR on ALFRED compared to PaLM-E, with a 2× reduction in training samples.  
2. **Generalization**: Achieve >60% success on unseen task combinations by leveraging the modular hierarchy.  
3. **Real-World Feasibility**: Demonstrate 70% sim-to-real transfer efficiency in controlled home environments.  

**Broader Impact**  
This framework could revolutionize robotics in unstructured settings, enabling:  
- **Accessible Home Assistants**: Robots that adapt to users’ verbal instructions without meticulous programming.  
- **Theoretical Advances**: New insights into hierarchical state representations that disentangle semantics from control.  
- **Sustainable AI**: Reduced data requirements via self-supervised HRL lower the carbon footprint of training.  

**Ethical Considerations**  
We will publicly release the simulation environment and code while restricting real-world deployment guidelines to prevent misuse in surveillance or military contexts.
