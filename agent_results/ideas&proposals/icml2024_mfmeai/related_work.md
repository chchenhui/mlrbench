**Key Challenges**:

1. **Bridging High-Level Semantics and Low-Level Control**: Effectively translating the rich semantic understanding provided by multimodal foundation models into precise, low-level actions remains a significant challenge. Ensuring that high-level insights can guide nuanced manipulation and navigation tasks is crucial for the development of adaptable embodied agents.

2. **Sample Efficiency in Complex Environments**: Achieving sample-efficient learning in complex, partially observable 3D environments is difficult. Hierarchical reinforcement learning approaches must balance exploration and exploitation to learn effective policies without excessive data requirements.

3. **Generalization to Novel Tasks**: Developing agents that can generalize learned skills to novel tasks and environments is essential. Ensuring that hierarchical controllers and multimodal models can adapt to unforeseen scenarios without extensive retraining is a persistent challenge.

4. **Integration of Multimodal Inputs**: Seamlessly integrating diverse sensor modalities (e.g., RGB, depth, audio) into a cohesive framework that informs both high-level decision-making and low-level control is complex. Ensuring that all modalities contribute meaningfully to the agent's performance requires sophisticated model architectures and training strategies.

5. **Real-World Transferability**: Transferring policies learned in simulated environments to real-world settings involves overcoming discrepancies between simulation and reality. Addressing issues such as sensor noise, dynamic environments, and unmodeled physical interactions is critical for deploying embodied agents in practical applications.
