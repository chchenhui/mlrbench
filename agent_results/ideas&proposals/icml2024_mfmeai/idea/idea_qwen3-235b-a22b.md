1. Title: **Adaptive Hierarchical Architectures for MFM-Driven Robotic Manipulation**  
2. Motivation: Current embodied agents using Multi-modal Foundation Models (MFMs) often struggle to bridge high-level semantic reasoning with low-level control, leading to brittle or inefficient interactions in dynamic environments. Existing frameworks treat MFMs as static modules, failing to adapt to real-time feedback or environmental changes. This limits applications in complex physical tasks like robotics, where seamless integration of perception, planning, and control is critical.  
3. Main Idea: Propose a **dynamic hierarchical framework** that combines MFM-based semantic reasoning with modular, reward-driven low-level controllers. The system will: (1) use MFMs (e.g., GPT-4V, LLaVA) for high-level task parsing and contextual understanding, (2) employ reinforcement learning (RL) agents to adaptively translate MFM outputs into actionable low-level commands, and (3) integrate a bidirectional feedback loop for error correction and real-time adaptation. For example, an MFM might parse a natural language task ("Pour coffee into a mug on the table") and guide a robotic arm via learned control policies, with tactile, visual, and proprioceptive sensors refining execution. Training will use hybrid simulation-physical data (via imitation learning and offline RL) to mitigate sim-to-real gaps. Expected outcomes include improved generalization in unseen tasks (e.g., handling novel objects) and reduced computational overhead by decoupling MFM inference from control frequency. This could enable scalable, robust agents for real-world applications like assistive robotics and autonomous exploration.
