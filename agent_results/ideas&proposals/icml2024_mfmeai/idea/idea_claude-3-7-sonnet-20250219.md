# Adaptive Perceptual Grounding for Multimodal Embodied Agents

## Motivation
Current multimodal foundation models (MFMs) excel at understanding diverse data types but struggle with the continuous, real-time perception-action loops needed for embodied AI. The gap between high-level semantic understanding and low-level control signals hinders embodied agents from effectively operating in physical environments. Moreover, MFMs trained on static datasets often fail to capture the dynamic nature of embodied tasks, where perceptual inputs constantly change based on agent actions.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel framework that bridges the perception-action gap through "adaptive perceptual grounding" - a mechanism that dynamically maps high-level multimodal representations to low-level control signals based on task context and environmental feedback. The system consists of three components: (1) a multimodal encoder that processes visual and linguistic inputs to create rich representations, (2) a grounding module that maps these representations to action primitives while maintaining semantic alignment, and (3) a feedback loop that continuously refines the grounding based on action outcomes. This approach enables embodied agents to leverage MFMs' semantic understanding while maintaining precise control. We'll evaluate the system in simulated environments requiring complex physical interactions and demonstrate how it reduces the semantic-control gap. This work will establish a foundation for embodied AI systems that maintain semantic richness while achieving fine-grained control.
