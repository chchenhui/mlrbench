**Title:** Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment for Multimodal Representation Learning  

**Motivation:** Multimodal models often align modalities in Euclidean spaces, which inadequately capture hierarchical or asymmetric relationships (e.g., "animal" â†’ "dog" in text vs. fine-grained visual features). This limits their ability to leverage semantic hierarchies and leads to suboptimal generalization. Addressing this gap is critical for tasks requiring relational reasoning, such as medical diagnosis (combining X-rays and structured reports) or robotics (sensor and action sequences).  

**Main Idea:** Propose a hyperbolic space-based framework to learn hierarchical and structured multimodal representations. Using hyperbolic geometry, which naturally embeds tree-like structures with low distortion, the model aligns modalities by optimizing a contrastive loss in hyperbolic space while preserving their inherent semantic hierarchies. For example, text embeddings are projected onto hyperbolic manifolds to capture categorical relationships, while visual embeddings are aligned hierarchically via graph-based constraints. Experiments on datasets like Visual Genome and multimodal medical imaging would assess improvements in hierarchical reasoning (e.g., precision@k in retrieval) and robustness to missing modalities. The outcome would demonstrate how geometdomains where data relationships are intrinsically hierarchical.ry-aware alignment enhances cross-modal semantic coherence, benefiting
