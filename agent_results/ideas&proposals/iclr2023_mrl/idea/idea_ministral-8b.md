### Title: "Quantifying Modal Interactions: A Multi-Scale Analysis Approach"

### Motivation
The success of multimodal machine learning hinges on understanding and effectively leveraging interactions between different modalities. However, current methods often overlook the complex, multi-scale nature of these interactions. This research aims to address this gap by proposing a novel multi-scale analysis approach to quantify and understand the interactions between modalities, thereby enhancing the robustness and performance of multimodal models.

### Main Idea
The proposed research introduces a multi-scale analysis framework to systematically investigate the interactions between modalities. This framework involves three key components:

1. **Multi-Scale Feature Extraction**: Utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features at multiple scales from each modality. This allows capturing both fine-grained and coarse-grained interactions.

2. **Interaction Matrix Learning**: Develop a novel interaction matrix learning algorithm that captures the strength and nature of interactions between modalities at different scales. This matrix will be learned using a combination of self-supervised and supervised learning techniques.

3. **Downstream Task Integration**: Integrate the learned interaction matrices into downstream tasks to improve the performance and robustness of multimodal models. This will be evaluated using a variety of benchmarks, including image-text tasks, audio-visual tasks, and multimodal classification problems.

The expected outcomes of this research include enhanced understanding of modality interactions, improved performance of multimodal models, and a novel framework for multi-scale interaction analysis. The potential impact is significant, as it could lead to more robust and generalizable multimodal models, opening up new avenues for applications in various domains such as healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and multimedia understanding.
