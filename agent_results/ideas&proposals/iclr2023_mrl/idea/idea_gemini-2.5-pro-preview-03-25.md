**Title:** Geometric Alignment for Cross-Modal Representation Transfer

**Motivation:** Understanding the geometry of multimodal representation spaces is crucial for effective fusion and downstream task performance. Misaligned geometries between unimodal representations can hinder the learning of a shared space, potentially leading to suboptimal fusion and poor generalization. This research aims to understand and improve how the geometric structures of different modalities relate within a learned joint representation.

**Main Idea:** We propose investigating geometric alignment techniques (e.g., using Optimal Transport or Riemannian geometry methods) explicitly during training. Instead of solely relying on instance-level alignment (like contrastive losses), we will introduce objectives that encourage structural similarity (e.g., preserving local neighborhoods or matching distributions) between the manifolds corresponding to different modalities within the shared embedding space. We hypothesize this will lead to more robust and semantically meaningful representations, improving performance on downstream tasks, especially those requiring fine-grained cross-modal understanding or generation. We will evaluate this by analyzing the representation geometry and measuring performance on tasks like cross-modal retrieval and translation.
