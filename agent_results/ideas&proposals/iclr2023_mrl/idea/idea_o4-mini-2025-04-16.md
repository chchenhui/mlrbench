Title: Graph-Regularized Contrastive Alignment for Robust Multimodal Representations

Motivation:  
Fusing heterogeneous modalities often breaks intrinsic manifold structures, yielding brittle embeddings that falter under noise or missing inputs. Current contrastive methods align samples across modalities but disregard modality-specific geometry, limiting interpretability and robustness. Incorporating geometric priors can produce semantically meaningful, resilient multimodal representations.

Main Idea:  
We introduce a dual-branch encoder trained with three complementary losses:  
1. Cross-modal contrastive loss that pulls semantically matched samples together and pushes mismatches apart.  
2. Graph-preservation loss: for each modality, build a k-NN graph on raw features, compute its Laplacian, and penalize distortion of local neighborhood relations in the latent space.  
3. Smoothness regularizer that discourages abrupt embedding transitions to enhance robustness.  

By jointly optimizing these objectives, the model learns embeddings that both respect modality-specific manifold geometry and achieve tight cross-modal alignment. We expect gains in downstream task performance (e.g., retrieval, classification), heightened resilience to adversarial noise and missing modalities, and greater interpretability via the spectral properties of the learned graphs. Validation will be performed on standard vision–language and audio–text benchmarks under perturbation and occlusion scenarios.
