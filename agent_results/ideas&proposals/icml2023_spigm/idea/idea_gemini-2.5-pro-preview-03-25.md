**Title:** Domain-Knowledge-Constrained Score-Based Generative Models for Structured Data

**Motivation:** Generative models for structured data like graphs or time series often produce outputs that are syntactically plausible but semantically or physically invalid according to domain rules (e.g., chemically invalid molecules, physically impossible trajectories). Explicitly encoding domain knowledge as hard constraints remains challenging within current generative frameworks, limiting their practical applicability in science and engineering.

**Main Idea:** We propose incorporating domain-specific constraints directly into the sampling process of score-based generative models (diffusion models). The core idea is to modify the reverse diffusion (sampling) step by projecting the intermediate state onto the manifold defined by the known constraints. This projection can be approximated using techniques like gradient projection or by adding a constraint-enforcing term derived from differentiable representations of the domain rules (e.g., energy functions, conservation laws) to the score function estimate. We expect this approach to significantly increase the validity rate of generated structured data (e.g., molecules obeying valency rules, trajectories conserving energy) with minimal impact on sample diversity, thereby enhancing the utility of generative models in scientific discovery.
