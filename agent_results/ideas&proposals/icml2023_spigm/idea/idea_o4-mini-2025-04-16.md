Title: Domain-Structured Normalizing Flows for Uncertainty-Aware Time Series Forecasting

Motivation: Multi-scale patterns (seasonality, trend, regime shifts) and domain constraints (bounds, conservation laws) in time series are often overlooked by standard generative models, resulting in unrealistic predictions and poorly calibrated uncertainties. Embedding expert knowledge into probabilistic models can boost forecast accuracy, interpretability, and reliability for scientific and industrial applications.

Main Idea: We propose a two-tier normalizing flow architecture that seamlessly integrates domain priors and flexible neural transforms. Tier 1 uses analytic base distributions encoding known seasonality and trend patterns, along with custom bijectors that enforce hard constraints (e.g., positivity, conservation). Tier 2 comprises conditional coupling layers parameterized by neural networks that adapt to latent regime variables inferred via amortized variational inference. Physical and domain constraints are incorporated through differentiable penalty terms in the log-likelihood. To handle long sequences efficiently, we introduce low-rank Jacobian approximations for fast forward and inverse passes. We will benchmark the method on climate and energy-consumption datasets, evaluating predictive accuracy, calibration of uncertainty intervals, and training/inference speed against vanilla flows and probabilistic RNNs. By fusing domain expertise with structured generative modeling, this approach delivers robust, interpretable forecasts for complex time series.
