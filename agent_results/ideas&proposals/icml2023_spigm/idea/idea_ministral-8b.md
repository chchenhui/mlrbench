### Title: "Graph Neural Networks for Uncertainty Quantification in Complex Systems"

### Motivation:
Uncertainty quantification is crucial in AI systems, especially when dealing with complex, structured data such as graphs. Traditional methods struggle to capture and propagate uncertainty effectively. This research aims to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that can handle uncertainty quantification in large-scale, real-world graphs, addressing challenges like scalability and interpretability.

### Main Idea:
We propose a novel framework for uncertainty quantification in graph-structured data using Graph Neural Networks. The proposed method, called **Uncertainty-GNN**, leverages the expressiveness of GNNs to model the uncertainty in node features and graph structures. The core idea involves:
1. **Graph Encoder**: A GNN-based encoder that captures the structural and feature information of the graph.
2. **Uncertainty Layer**: An additional layer that estimates the uncertainty of node features and graph structures.
3. **Uncertainty Propagation**: A mechanism to propagate uncertainty through the graph, enabling the model to handle complex dependencies.

The methodology includes:
- Training the model on diverse graph datasets with known uncertainties.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Brier score and mean squared error.
- Comparing the proposed method with existing uncertainty quantification techniques.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved scalability and efficiency in uncertainty quantification for large graphs.
- Enhanced interpretability of uncertainty estimates in complex systems.
- Practical implementations in areas like social network analysis, drug discovery, and recommendation systems.

The potential impact includes:
- More reliable AI systems that can make informed decisions under uncertainty.
- Advancements in understanding and modeling complex, real-world phenomena.
- Enhanced collaboration between academia and industry in developing robust probabilistic methods for structured data.
