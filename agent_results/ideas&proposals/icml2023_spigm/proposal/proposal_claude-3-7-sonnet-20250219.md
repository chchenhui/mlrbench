# Uncertainty-Aware Message Propagation Networks: Integrating Bayesian Principles in GNNs for Reliable Decision Support

## Introduction

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, demonstrating remarkable success across diverse domains including molecular property prediction, social network analysis, and traffic forecasting. Their ability to capture complex relational patterns through message passing mechanisms has led to state-of-the-art performance in numerous graph-based tasks. However, despite their impressive predictive capabilities, standard GNNs offer only point estimates without quantifying the uncertainty associated with their predictions.

This limitation presents a significant challenge in high-stakes applications where decision-makers require not only accurate predictions but also reliable confidence levels. For instance, in drug discovery, understanding the uncertainty in predicted molecular properties is crucial for prioritizing compounds for synthesis and testing. Similarly, in financial fraud detection and infrastructure management, the cost of false positives or negatives necessitates models that can effectively communicate their confidence levels to human operators.

While recent research has begun to address uncertainty quantification in GNNs, most existing approaches treat uncertainty as an afterthought rather than an integral part of the model architecture. Typically, these methods apply post-hoc uncertainty estimation techniques such as Monte Carlo dropout or ensemble methods to pre-trained GNNs. Such approaches often fail to capture the intrinsic uncertainty that propagates through the graph structure during the message-passing process, leading to unreliable confidence estimates, particularly for out-of-distribution data.

The research objective of this proposal is to develop a principled Bayesian framework that integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the message-passing architecture of GNNs. Unlike existing methods that apply Bayesian principles as an afterthought, our approach maintains distributions over node and edge features throughout the computation graph, allowing for end-to-end uncertainty propagation. This integrated approach aims to:

1. Distinguish between aleatoric uncertainty (inherent data noise) and epistemic uncertainty (model knowledge gaps) through separate parameterizations.
2. Develop uncertainty-aware message passing mechanisms that incorporate uncertainty estimates into the aggregation process.
3. Design specialized attention mechanisms that dynamically weight neighbor contributions based on their uncertainty levels.
4. Create interpretable uncertainty visualization techniques that can guide human decision-makers.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of GNN applications in critical domains. By providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, our framework will enable more informed decision-making processes where the confidence in predictions is as important as the predictions themselves. Furthermore, the ability to distinguish between different sources of uncertainty offers valuable insights for model improvement and data collection strategies. From a theoretical perspective, this work contributes to the broader understanding of uncertainty propagation in graph-structured data and establishes connections between Bayesian inference and message passing in GNNs.

## Methodology

Our proposed methodology introduces Uncertainty-Aware Message Propagation Networks (UAMP-Nets), a novel framework that integrates Bayesian principles directly into the message-passing architecture of GNNs. The framework consists of four key components: (1) Bayesian parameter formulation, (2) uncertainty-aware message passing, (3) attention-based uncertainty aggregation, and (4) specialized loss functions for uncertainty calibration.

### Bayesian Parameter Formulation

Instead of maintaining point estimates of node and edge features, UAMP-Nets represent these features as probability distributions. Specifically, for each node $v_i$, we define its features as a multivariate Gaussian distribution:

$$\mathbf{h}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_i, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i)$$

where $\boldsymbol{\mu}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ represents the mean vector and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ the covariance matrix for node $v_i$'s $d$-dimensional feature representation.

To maintain computational efficiency while capturing the essential uncertainty information, we employ a diagonal approximation of the covariance matrix:

$$\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i = \text{diag}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}_i^2)$$

where $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_i^2 \in \mathbb{R}^d$ represents the variance of each feature dimension.

To distinguish between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, we further decompose the variance term:

$$\boldsymbol{\sigma}_i^2 = \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{i,a}^2 + \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{i,e}^2$$

where $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{i,a}^2$ represents aleatoric uncertainty (data noise) and $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{i,e}^2$ represents epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty).

### Uncertainty-Aware Message Passing

The core innovation of UAMP-Nets lies in our uncertainty-aware message passing mechanism. Traditional message passing in GNNs can be formulated as:

$$\mathbf{h}_i^{(l+1)} = \text{UPDATE}^{(l)} \left( \mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}, \text{AGGREGATE}^{(l)} \left( \{ \mathbf{h}_j^{(l)} : j \in \mathcal{N}(i) \} \right) \right)$$

where $\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}$ represents the features of node $v_i$ at layer $l$, $\mathcal{N}(i)$ denotes the neighbors of node $v_i$, and UPDATE and AGGREGATE are learnable functions.

In our Bayesian formulation, we redefine message passing to operate on distributions rather than point estimates:

$$\boldsymbol{\mu}_i^{(l+1)}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i^{2(l+1)} = \text{UPDATE}_\mu^{(l)} \left( \boldsymbol{\mu}_i^{(l)}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i^{2(l)}, \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathcal{N}(i)}^{(l)}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\mathcal{N}(i)}^{2(l)} \right)$$

where $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathcal{N}(i)}^{(l)}$ and $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\mathcal{N}(i)}^{2(l)}$ represent the aggregated mean and variance from the neighbors of node $v_i$.

The aggregation function is designed to incorporate uncertainty from neighboring nodes:

$$\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathcal{N}(i)}^{(l)} = \frac{\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} w_{ij} \boldsymbol{\mu}_j^{(l)}}{\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} w_{ij}}$$

$$\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\mathcal{N}(i)}^{2(l)} = \frac{\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} w_{ij}^2 \boldsymbol{\sigma}_j^{2(l)}}{\left(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} w_{ij}\right)^2} + \frac{\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} w_{ij}^2 (\boldsymbol{\mu}_j^{(l)} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\mathcal{N}(i)}^{(l)})^2}{\left(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} w_{ij}\right)^2}$$

where $w_{ij}$ represents the edge weight between nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$. This formulation ensures that the uncertainty propagates through the graph structure, with the second term capturing the disagreement among neighbors as additional uncertainty.

### Attention-Based Uncertainty Aggregation

To enhance the model's ability to selectively aggregate information based on uncertainty levels, we introduce an uncertainty-aware attention mechanism:

$$\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp\left(a(\boldsymbol{\mu}_i^{(l)}, \boldsymbol{\mu}_j^{(l)}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i^{2(l)}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_j^{2(l)})\right)}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \exp\left(a(\boldsymbol{\mu}_i^{(l)}, \boldsymbol{\mu}_k^{(l)}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i^{2(l)}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_k^{2(l)})\right)}$$

where $a(\cdot)$ is an attention function that computes the importance of neighbor $v_j$ to node $v_i$, incorporating both feature similarity and uncertainty levels. We define this function as:

$$a(\boldsymbol{\mu}_i, \boldsymbol{\mu}_j, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i^2, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_j^2) = \mathbf{q}^T \tanh\left(\mathbf{W}_1 \boldsymbol{\mu}_i + \mathbf{W}_2 \boldsymbol{\mu}_j + \mathbf{W}_3 \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i^2 + \mathbf{W}_4 \boldsymbol{\sigma}_j^2\right)$$

where $\mathbf{W}_1, \mathbf{W}_2, \mathbf{W}_3, \mathbf{W}_4$, and $\mathbf{q}$ are learnable parameters. This attention mechanism allows the model to rely less on highly uncertain neighbors, enhancing the robustness of the message passing process.

### Variational Inference and Loss Function

To train UAMP-Nets, we employ variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution over the model parameters. The evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective is formulated as:

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\theta(\mathbf{W})}[\log p(Y|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{A}, \mathbf{W})] - \text{KL}(q_\theta(\mathbf{W})||p(\mathbf{W}))$$

where $q_\theta(\mathbf{W})$ is the variational distribution over the model parameters $\mathbf{W}$, $p(Y|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{A}, \mathbf{W})$ is the likelihood of the target variables $Y$ given the node features $\mathbf{X}$, adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$, and model parameters $\mathbf{W}$, and $p(\mathbf{W})$ is the prior distribution over the model parameters.

To ensure well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, we incorporate an additional calibration term into our loss function:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{calibration}}(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^N |P(y_i \in [l_i, u_i]) - (1-\alpha)|$$

where $[l_i, u_i]$ represents the predicted confidence interval for data point $i$ at confidence level $1-\alpha$, and $P(y_i \in [l_i, u_i])$ is the empirical probability that the true value $y_i$ falls within this interval.

Our final loss function combines the ELBO objective with the calibration term:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}}(\theta) = \mathcal{L}(\theta) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{calibration}}(\theta)$$

where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter controlling the trade-off between prediction accuracy and calibration quality.

### Experimental Design

We will evaluate UAMP-Nets on three distinct application domains:

1. **Molecular Property Prediction**: Using the QM9 and ZINC datasets to predict molecular properties such as HOMO-LUMO gap, atomization energy, and solubility. We will compare against state-of-the-art models including SchNet, DimeNet++, and their Bayesian variants.

2. **Traffic Forecasting**: Using the METR-LA and PEMS-BAY datasets to predict future traffic speeds and volumes. Comparisons will be made against DCRNN, Graph WaveNet, and ensemble-based uncertainty methods.

3. **Social Network Analysis**: Using the Twitch, Reddit, and DBLP datasets to predict node properties and link formation. We will compare against GraphSAGE, GAT, and their Bayesian counterparts.

For each application, we will evaluate UAMP-Nets based on the following metrics:

1. **Prediction Accuracy**:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
   - Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) for classification tasks

2. **Uncertainty Quality**:
   - Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
   - Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)
   - Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP)
   - Mean Prediction Interval Width (MPIW)

3. **Out-of-Distribution Detection**:
   - AUROC for OOD detection
   - False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate (FPR95)

To validate the effectiveness of our approach in distinguishing between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, we will design experiments with controlled levels of data noise and distribution shifts. For instance, in molecular property prediction, we will introduce synthetic noise to a subset of training data to evaluate the model's ability to identify and quantify aleatoric uncertainty. Similarly, we will evaluate on structurally diverse molecules to assess the model's epistemic uncertainty on out-of-distribution examples.

- Optimization: Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling
- Hyperparameter tuning: Bayesian optimization with 5-fold cross-validation
- Baseline implementations: Using published code repositories with consistent preprocessing and evaluation protocols
