# MultiModal Self-Supervised Learning for Behavioral Health Time Series

## Motivation
Behavioral health data from wearables and EHRs often come as multi-modal time series with irregular sampling, missing values, and limited labels. Traditional supervised learning approaches fail to fully leverage the rich information in these datasets due to label scarcity and the complex temporal relationships between modalities. Developing methods that can learn robust representations from unlabeled multi-modal behavioral health time series would enable more accurate predictions of mental health conditions, treatment responses, and behavioral patterns, potentially transforming preventive care and personalized interventions.

## Main Idea
I propose a novel multi-modal self-supervised learning framework specifically designed for behavioral health time series. The approach leverages contrastive learning across different views of the same behavioral data (e.g., sleep patterns, activity levels, heart rate variability, digital phenotyping) while handling the unique challenges of health time series. Key innovations include: (1) temporally-aware contrastive objectives that preserve sequential dependencies across modalities; (2) irregularity-robust encoders with adaptive attention mechanisms to handle varying sampling rates; (3) modality-completion pretext tasks that learn from and impute missing modalities; and (4) behavior-specific augmentation strategies that preserve clinically relevant patterns. The framework would be evaluated on predicting depression trajectories, stress levels, and treatment responses, with implementations designed to protect privacy and provide interpretable insights about behavioral patterns that influence health outcomes.
