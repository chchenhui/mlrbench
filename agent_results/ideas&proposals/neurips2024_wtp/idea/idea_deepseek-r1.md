**Title:** VL-AlignBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Video-Language Alignment Evaluation  

**Motivation:** The lack of standardized benchmarks for video-language alignment hinders objective evaluation and comparison of models, slowing progress in applications like content search and robotics. Current benchmarks are narrow in scope, failing to assess multimodal integration, temporal reasoning, and real-world complexity comprehensively.  

**Main Idea:** We propose VL-AlignBench, a benchmark suite covering diverse alignment tasks (retrieval, captioning, temporal grounding), modalities (video, audio, text), and domains (eg, instructional videos, movies). It integrates existing datasets (e.g., ActivityNet, How2Vid69M) with **new synthetic and real-world video-text pairs** emphasizing temporal causality and rare events. Tasks are designed with multi-step metrics, like accuracy in temporal reasoning for question-answering and fine-grained retrieval. We also introduce an efficiency score balancing performance with computational cost (frames processed per second). The benchmark includes a leaderboard and diagnostic tools to identify model biases. Expected outcomes: 1) a unified framework for assessing alignment, 2) insights into model limitations (e.g., handling long-range dependencies), and 3) a roadmap for scalable, interpretable video-language models. Impact: Accelerate research by enabling reproducible comparisons and guiding model design toward robust real-world applicability.
