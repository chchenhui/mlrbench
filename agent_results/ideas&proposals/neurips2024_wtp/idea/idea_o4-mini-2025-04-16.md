Title: Chain-of-Thought Synthetic Annotation for Enhanced Video-Language Pretraining

Motivation:  
High-quality, fine-grained video annotations are scarce and expensive, hindering the development of robust video-language models. Automating annotation at scale can dramatically accelerate progress in video understanding, retrieval, and downstream tasks.

Main Idea:  
We propose a two-stage “SynthAnno” pipeline. First, a pretrained video-language model segments input videos into semantically coherent shots and generates coarse captions. Second, a large language model (LLM) is prompted with each shot’s visual features and coarse caption, using a chain-of-thought strategy to produce detailed, temporally aligned annotations (actions, objects, relations). A vision–language verifier assigns confidence scores, filtering out low-quality pairs. The resulting synthetic dataset—orders of magnitude larger than existing ones—is used to pretrain a video-language transformer via multimodal contrastive and captioning objectives. We evaluate on zero-shot retrieval, captioning and QA benchmarks, expecting significant gains in precision and generalization. This method reduces manual labeling costs, enriches training data diversity, and establishes a scalable path toward high-fidelity video annotations for future research.
