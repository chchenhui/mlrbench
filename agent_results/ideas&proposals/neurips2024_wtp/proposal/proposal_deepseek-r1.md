**Research Proposal: FineActionBench: A Benchmark for Fine-Grained Temporal Video-Language Alignment**  

---

### 1. Introduction  

#### Background  
Video-language models are pivotal for interpreting the vast amounts of video data generated daily, powering applications like robotics, surveillance, and content creation. However, as outlined in the *Workshop on Touch Processing*, the field faces critical challenges: (1) scarcity of high-quality annotated video data, (2) inefficient processing techniques for large-scale video content, (3) the complexity of multimodal fusion, and (4) the lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating fine-grained temporal alignment. While recent works like *TemporalBench* (2024), *VideoComp* (2025), and *FIBER* (2024) address aspects of temporal understanding, they focus on retrieval, captioning, or event-level reasoning rather than **precise phrase-to-segment grounding**. This gap hinders the development of models capable of tasks requiring millisecond-level alignment, such as instructional video analysis or robotic action sequencing.  

#### Research Objectives  
1. **Curate a benchmark dataset** with dense temporal annotations linking textual phrases to exact video segments in multi-step activities.  
2. **Develop evaluation metrics** tailored for fine-grained temporal grounding, including phrase-localized Temporal IoU and hierarchical accuracy scores.  
3. **Establish baseline performances** of state-of-the-art video-language models (e.g., *Grounded-VideoLLM*, *PiTe*) on the benchmark.  
4. **Analyze challenges** in temporal modeling, such as co-occurring actions and long-term dependencies, to guide future research.  

#### Significance  
FineActionBench will provide:  
- A standardized tool for evaluating **temporal grounding precision**, addressing the community’s lack of robust benchmarks.  
- Insights into how well current models capture fine-grained interactions between language and video.  
- A pathway to improve multimodal fusion and temporal reasoning in video-language models for applications like procedural video analysis.

### 2. Methodology  

#### Data Collection & Annotation  
- **Video Sources**: Curate 5,000 untrimmed videos (~10–60 seconds) from existing datasets (*FineAction*, *FIBER*) and platforms like YouTube, focusing on multi-step activities (e.g., cooking, assembly, sports).  
- **Annotation Process**:  
  1. **Temporal Segmentation**: Use expert annotators to divide videos into atomic actions (e.g., “pour water into bowl” in a cooking video) with start/end timestamps.  
  2. **Phrase Annotation**: Link each segment to a short textual phrase, ensuring phrases are **compositional** (e.g., “slice onion” vs. “chop carrots”) and cover overlapping actions.  
  3. **Validation**: Compute inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss’ κ ≥ 0.8) to ensure consistency.  

#### Benchmark Structure  
- **Splits**: 3,000 training, 1,000 validation, and 1,000 test videos.  
- **Task Formats**:  
  - **Temporal Grounding**: Given a video and a phrase, predict the segment’s start/end times.  
  - **Phrase Localization**: Given a video and a set of candidate phrases, rank phrases by relevance to a queried segment.  

#### Evaluation Metrics  
1. **Phrase-Localized Temporal IoU**:  
   $$ \text{T-IoU} = \frac{|G \cap P|}{|G \cup P|} $$  
   where $G$ is the ground truth segment and $P$ is the predicted segment. Compute mean T-IoU across all test samples.  
2. **Hierarchical Accuracy**:  
   - **Action-Level**: Exact match of predicted and ground truth segments (T-IoU ≥ 0.9).  
   - **Step-Level**: Partial overlap (0.5 ≤ T-IoU < 0.9).  
3. **Ablation Metrics**:  
   - **Temporal Robustness Score (TRS)**: Evaluate performance on overlapping or co-occurring actions.  
   - **Long-Term Dependency Score (LTDS)**: Measure accuracy on actions spanning >50% of the video.  

#### Experimental Design  
- **Baseline Models**: Evaluate *Grounded-VideoLLM* (2024), *PiTe* (2024), and *VidLA* (2024) using their official implementations.  
- **Ablation Studies**:  
  - **Modality Ablation**: Remove audio/text inputs to quantify their impact.  
  - **Temporal Modeling**: Compare frame-sampling strategies (uniform vs. dynamic).  
- **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Test model performance on *TemporalBench* to assess generalization.  

#### Algorithmic Framework for Baselines  
We adapt *PiTe*’s pixel-temporal alignment framework to process phrase queries:  
1. **Input Encoding**:  
   - Video: Sample frames at 1 FPS, encode via ViT-L/14.  
   - Text: Embed phrases using RoBERTa.  
2. **Multimodal Fusion**:  
   Use cross-attention transformers to align visual and textual tokens:  
   $$ \mathbf{A}_{ij} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}_v \mathbf{K}_t^\top}{\sqrt{d}}\right) $$  
   where $\mathbf{Q}_v$ (visual queries) and $\mathbf{K}_t$ (text keys) are projected embeddings.  
3. **Temporal Localization**:  
   Predict segment boundaries using a TIOU-guided regression head trained with:  
   $$ \mathcal{L} = \lambda_1 \cdot \text{SmoothL1}(t_{\text{pred}}, t_{\text{gt}}) + \lambda_2 \cdot (1 - \text{T-IoU}) $$

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

#### Expected Outcomes  
1. **Benchmark Dataset**: Publicly release FineActionBench with 5,000 videos and 50,000 phrase-segment pairs.  
2. **Performance Gap Identification**: Show that even state-of-the-art models achieve <50% Action-Level accuracy, highlighting deficiencies in fine-grained reasoning.  
3. **Metric Insights**: Demonstrate that hierarchical metrics better reflect real-world usability than mean T-IoU alone.  
4. **Training Improvements**: Propose a data augmentation strategy (e.g., temporal shuffling of phrases) to boost model accuracy by ~15%.  

#### Impact  
- **Research Community**: Accelerate progress in video-language modeling by providing a shared evaluation platform.  
- **Industry Applications**: Enable precise video search (“Find the step where the chef adds salt”) and robotics (matching verbal instructions to actions).  
- **Theoretical Contribution**: Advance understanding of how temporal attention mechanisms and multimodal fusion affect grounding precision.
