# FineActionBench: A Benchmark for Fine-Grained Temporal Video-Language Alignment

## 1. Introduction

### Background and Motivation  
Video-language models (VLMs) have emerged as critical tools for processing multimodal content across applications ranging from video search to robotics. However, a persistent challenge lies in evaluating their ability to perform *fine-grained temporal alignment*—the precise mapping of textual descriptions to specific moments in a video. Current benchmarks like ActivityNet, YouCook2, and HowTo100M rely on coarse-grained tasks such as video-text retrieval or captioning, which fail to test the nuanced temporal understanding required for tasks like activity parsing or event localization. For instance, while a model might successfully identify a "salad preparation" video for the query "how to make a salad," it may misalign specific sub-actions like "dicing cucumbers" to their exact temporal positions. This gap hinders the development of models capable of real-world applications demanding precision, such as automated video editing or step-by-step instruction generation.

### Research Objectives  
This proposal introduces **FineActionBench**, a benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate fine-grained temporal alignment by:  
1. Curating densely annotated videos depicting multi-step activities.  
2. Generating phrase-level textual descriptions localized to precise video segments.  
3. Developing novel metrics like phrase-localized Temporal Intersection over Union (T-IoU).  
4. Establishing baseline performance through experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs.  

### Significance  
FineActionBench addresses four key challenges identified in the literature:  
1. **Lack of Fine-Grained Annotations**: Existing datasets often provide coarse temporal labels (e.g., start/end timestamps for entire activities).  
2. **Temporal Dynamics**: Models struggle to capture complex dependencies between sub-actions (e.g., "boiling pasta" precedes "draining").  
3. **Multimodal Integration**: Aligning phrase-level semantics (e.g., "stirring anti-clockwise") with visual-audio cues remains non-trivial.  
4. **Benchmarking Limitations**: Current benchmarks like TemporalBench (2024) or E.T. Bench (2024) focus on open-ended tasks rather than localized alignment.  

By resolving these gaps, FineActionBench will enable targeted improvements in applications such as medical procedure analysis, where precise alignment of textual steps to video is critical.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Collection and Annotation  
**Dataset Curation**:  
- **Source**: Build on the FineAction dataset (2021), which contains 103K temporal instances across 17K untrimmed videos. Expand it by adding 5K new videos from diverse domains (cooking, sports, assembly) to enhance diversity.  
- **Selection Criteria**: Prioritize videos with multi-step activities (≥5 sub-actions) and high-resolution frames (≥1080p). Exclude videos with excessive motion blur or occlusions.  

**Annotation Protocol**:  
- **Phrase Localization**: Each video will be annotated by three experts, who will:  
  1. Segment the video into sub-actions (e.g., "boiling water," "adding salt") with precise start/end timestamps ($t_{\text{start}}, t_{\text{end}}$).  
  2. Associate each segment with a descriptive phrase (e.g., "boiling water in a pot").  
  3. Resolve conflicts via majority voting, ensuring inter-annotator agreement ($\kappa \geq 0.7$).  
- **Quality Control**: Use Amazon Mechanical Turk to validate annotations, flagging segments with >1s temporal deviation.  

### 2.2 Benchmark Design  
**Task Definition**:  
- Given a video $V$ and a phrase $P$, the model must predict the temporal segment $[t_{\text{start}}^p, t_{\text{end}}^p]$ corresponding to $P$.  

**Novel Evaluation Metrics**:  
1. **Phrase-Localized T-IoU**:  
   $$
   \text{T-IoU} = \frac{\max(0, \min(t_{\text{end}}^p, t_{\text{end}}^g) - \max(t_{\text{start}}^p, t_{\text{start}}^g))}{t_{\text{end}}^p - t_{\text{start}}^p + t_{\text{end}}^g - t_{\text{start}}^g - \max(0, \min(t_{\text{end}}^p, t_{\text{end}}^g) - \max(t_{\text{start}}^p, t_{\text{start}}^g))}
   $$  
   where $t_{\text{start}}^p, t_{\text{end}}^p$ are predicted timestamps and $t_{\text{start}}^g, t_{\text{end}}^g$ are ground truth.  
2. **Mean Average Precision (mAP)** at different T-IoU thresholds (0.3–0.7).  
3. **Recall@K (R@K)** for top-K predicted segments.  
4. **Median Rank (MedR)** of correct predictions.  

### 2.3 Experimental Design  
**Baseline Models**:  
- **Two-Tower Architecture**: Adapt VidLA (2024), using ViT-B/16 for visual features and RoBERTa-base for text, initialized with CLIP weights.  
- **Hierarchical Models**: Implement VideoComp’s (2025) pairwise preference loss to penalize temporal disruptions.  
- **Temporal Streams**: Replicate Grounded-VideoLLM (2024) with a dual-stream transformer to encode frame relationships.  

**Training Protocol**:  
- **Pretraining**: Use PiTe-143k (2024) to initialize pixel-temporal embeddings.  
- **Fine-tuning**:  
  - Optimize with AdamW ($\beta_1=0.9, \beta_2=0.999$) and cross-entropy loss.  
  - Schedule learning rate with linear warmup (10% of epochs) and cosine decay.  
  - Augment videos with temporal jittering ($\pm5\%$ frame shifts).  

**Evaluation Setup**:  
- Split dataset into 70% training, 15% validation, 15% test.  
- Measure reproducibility via 5-fold cross-validation.  
- Control for domain bias by stratifying across activity types (e.g., cooking, sports).  

**Ablation Studies**:  
- Assess impact of annotation density (5 vs. 10 sub-actions/video).  
- Compare T-IoU variants: standard vs. phrase-weighted ($\text{T-IoU}_w$):  
  $$
  \text{T-IoU}_w = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i \cdot \text{T-IoU}_i
  $$  
  where $w_i$ weights by phrase length to penalize over-segmentation.  

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### 3.1 Deliverables  
1. **FineActionBench Dataset**: 22K videos with ≥200K phrase-segment pairs, released in JSON format:  
   ```json
   {
     "video_id": "FA1001",
     "phrases": [
       {"segment": [10.3, 15.1], "text": "boiling water in a pot"},
       {"segment": [20.5, 25.7], "text": "adding salt to the pot"}
     ]
   }
   ```
2. **Benchmark Metrics**: Standardized evaluation tools for T-IoU, mAP, and R@K.  

### 3.2 Scientific Impact  
- **Quantify Temporal Gaps**: Expected performance of SOTA models on FineActionBench will be ≈40% mAP@0.5, vs. human performance (≈85%), mirroring trends in TemporalBench (2024).  
- **Driving Model Improvements**: Metrics like T-IoU$_w$ will incentivize better temporal grounding, benefiting frameworks like PiTe or Grounded-VideoLLM.  
- **Community Standardization**: The benchmark will address the "lack of robust metrics" highlighted in the workshop literature, enabling fair comparisons.  

### 3.3 Application Impact  
- **High-Precision Domains**: Enable systems like robotic process automation to execute complex tasks (e.g., "insert screw A before tightening nut B").  
- **Content Creation**: Facilitate precise captioning for accessibility tools (e.g., "speaker pauses to emphasize point at 00:12:30").  
- **Surveillance**: Improve forensic analysis by aligning incident reports to exact video frames.  

## 4. Conclusion and Future Directions  

FineActionBench will fill a critical void in video-language understanding by focusing on precise temporal alignment. Future work includes:  
1. **Cross-Lingual Extensions**: Translate phrases into 10 languages to globalize applicability.  
2. **3D Temporal Modeling**: Incorporate spatial grounding (e.g., bounding boxes) for "action-object" localization.  
3. **Long-Tailed Activities**: Add rare domains (e.g., surgical procedures) to test generalization.  

By rigorously defining and evaluating this problem space, FineActionBench will catalyze advances in both fundamental research and applied multimodal AI.
