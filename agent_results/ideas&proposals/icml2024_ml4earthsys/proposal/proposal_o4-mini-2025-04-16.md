Title:
Physics-Constrained Generative Models for Realistic High-Impact Climate Extremes

Introduction:
Background  
Climate change is driving an increase in both the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events (heatwaves, floods, droughts). High-Impact, Low-Likelihood (HILL) events—those lying in the far tail of the climate variable distribution—are critical for risk assessment yet are severely undersampled in observations (e.g., ERA5 reanalysis). As a result, both numerical Earth System Models (ESMs) and purely data-driven methods struggle to characterize tail behavior reliably. Domain scientists have begun to explore hybrid physics-ML approaches (e.g., NeuralGCM) and physics-informed neural networks to embed conservation laws directly into learning. Meanwhile, extreme value theory (EVT) provides a statistical framework for modeling tails, but fails to capture the full spatio-temporal complexity of events.  
Research Objectives  
1. Develop a generative model that produces synthetic spatio-temporal fields of climate variables (e.g., precipitation, temperature, wind) reproducing realistic HILL events.  
2. Embed physical constraints—mass continuity, energy conservation, moisture budget—directly into the learning objective as soft penalties.  
3. Condition the generative process on extreme value statistics so that generated tail samples match the empirical EVT parameters for each location.  
4. Validate the method quantitatively against held-out reanalysis data and compare to baselines (standard GANs, EVT-only models, physics-only GANs).  
Significance  
Such a model will augment scarce observational data with synthetic but physically consistent extreme events, improving downstream climate impact modeling (e.g., flood risk, crop yield) and enabling more robust adaptation and mitigation planning.

Methodology:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing  
   • Datasets: ERA5 reanalysis (1979–2023) at 0.25° spatial, hourly temporal resolution; selected CMIP6 historical simulations for additional variability.  
   • Variables: Surface temperature $T$, precipitation rate $P$, horizontal wind components $(u,v)$, specific humidity $q$.  
   • Domain: Global land grid, aggregated to daily means for $T$, $q$, $(u,v)$, and daily maxima for $P$.  
   • Anomaly fields: Remove seasonal cycle by subtracting daily climatology, then normalize each variable to zero mean, unit variance.  
   • Defining extremes: For each grid cell, compute block‐maxima of daily precipitation and temperature anomalies; fit generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution to obtain location $\mu$, scale $\sigma$, shape $\xi$ parameters. Label samples exceeding the empirical 99.9th percentile as “extreme.”  

2. Model Architecture  
   We propose a Physics‐Informed Generative Adversarial Network (PI‐GAN) with the following components:  
   Generator $G_\theta$:  
     – Input: latent vector $z\in\mathbb{R}^{d_z}$ sampled from a heavy‐tailed prior (e.g., Student’s $t$ with $\nu\in[3,5]$ degrees of freedom) to encourage tail sampling.  
     – Architecture: a U‐Net–style convolutional network with residual blocks and multi‐scale skip connections, mapping $z\to \bigl[T_{\rm gen},P_{\rm gen},u_{\rm gen},v_{\rm gen},q_{\rm gen}\bigr]$.  
   Discriminator $D_\phi$:  
     – Input: real or generated multi‐channel fields.  
     – Architecture: a PatchGAN discriminator assessing spatio‐temporal patches, outputting a real/fake score.  
   Physics‐Error Discriminator $D_{\rm phy}$ (auxiliary):  
     – Computes local violations of physical laws (mass, energy, moisture); used only to compute losses, not to backpropagate adversarial gradients.  

3. Physics‐Informed Losses  
   We enforce three soft constraints as penalty terms. For a generated sample $x_{\rm gen}=\{T_{\rm gen},P_{\rm gen},u_{\rm gen},v_{\rm gen},q_{\rm gen}\}$ on a discrete spatial grid:  
   3.1 Mass continuity (incompressibility for horizontal flow, neglecting vertical advection in surface slice):  
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\rm mass} = \mathbb{E}_{z\sim p_z}\Bigl\|\nabla_h\!\cdot(u_{\rm gen},v_{\rm gen})\Bigr\|_2^2$$  
   where $\nabla_h\cdot = \partial_x + \partial_y$ approximated via finite differences.  
   3.2 Thermodynamic energy budget (first law approximation for surface layer):  
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\rm energy} = \mathbb{E}\Bigl\|\partial_t T_{\rm gen} + u_{\rm gen}\cdot\nabla_h T_{\rm gen} - \frac{Q_{\rm net}}{\rho c_p}\Bigr\|_2^2$$  
   with $Q_{\rm net}$ net surface flux from reanalysis, $\rho$ air density, $c_p$ specific heat.  
   3.3 Moisture conservation (surface moisture budget ignoring phase changes):  
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\rm moisture} = \mathbb{E}\Bigl\|\partial_t q_{\rm gen} + \nabla_h\cdot(q_{\rm gen}\,u_{\rm gen}) - E_{\rm obs}\Bigr\|_2^2,$$  
   where $E_{\rm obs}$ is evaporation from ERA5.  
   Combined physics loss:  
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\rm phy} = \lambda_m\mathcal{L}_{\rm mass} + \lambda_e\mathcal{L}_{\rm energy} + \lambda_q\mathcal{L}_{\rm moisture},$$  
   with hyper‐parameters $\lambda_m,\lambda_e,\lambda_q>0$.  

4. Extreme‐Value Tail Conditioning  
   To ensure the model reproduces observed tail behavior, we add a quantile loss based on EVT parameters at each grid cell. Let $Q_{\rm obs}(q)$ be the empirical $q$-quantile of the real anomalies at that cell. Define for $q\in \{0.95,0.99,0.995\}$:  
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\rm evt} \;=\; \sum_{q}\mathbb{E}_z\Bigl[\bigl(Q_{\rm gen}(q;z)-Q_{\rm obs}(q)\bigr)^2\Bigr],$$  
   where $Q_{\rm gen}(q;z)$ is the sample quantile computed over a minibatch of generated fields. This is implemented via sorting the top‐$k$ values in each batch and computing automatic differentiation through a smoothed quantile operator.  

5. Adversarial Loss and Total Objective  
   We adopt a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) for stable training. Define:  
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\rm adv}(D_\phi)=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{\rm real}}[D_\phi(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{z\sim p_z}[D_\phi(G_\theta(z))] + \gamma\,\mathbb{E}_{\hat x\sim p_{\hat x}}\bigl(\|\nabla_{\hat x}D_\phi(\hat x)\|_2-1\bigr)^2.$$  
   The generator’s adversarial loss is  
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\rm adv}^G = -\mathbb{E}_{z\sim p_z}[D_\phi(G_\theta(z))].$$  
   The total generator loss is  
   $$\mathcal{L}_{G} = \mathcal{L}_{\rm adv}^G \;+\;\alpha\,\mathcal{L}_{\rm phy}\;+\;\beta\,\mathcal{L}_{\rm evt},$$  
   where $\alpha,\beta>0$ are chosen by cross‐validation.  

6. Training Algorithm  
   1. Precompute empirical quantiles $Q_{\rm obs}(q)$ per grid cell.  
   2. For each training iteration:  
      a. Sample minibatch $\{z_i\}_{i=1}^N\sim p_z$ and real data $\{x_i\}\sim p_{\rm real}$.  
      b. Generate $\tilde x_i = G_\theta(z_i)$.  
      c. Update discriminator $D_\phi$ by minimizing $\mathcal{L}_{\rm adv}(D_\phi)$.  
      d. Compute $\mathcal{L}_{\rm phy}(\tilde x)$ and $\mathcal{L}_{\rm evt}(\tilde x)$.  
      e. Update generator $G_\theta$ by minimizing $\mathcal{L}_G$.  
   3. Repeat until convergence (monitored by stabilization of adversarial and physics losses).  

Hyperparameters:  
• $d_z=128$, batch size $N=32$, learning rates $\ell_r=10^{-4}$ (Adam with $\beta_1=0.5,\beta_2=0.9$).  
• Penalty weights $\lambda_m=1,\lambda_e=0.5,\lambda_q=0.5,\alpha=10^{-2},\beta=10^{-1},\gamma=10$.  

7. Experimental Design  
   Ablation studies:  
   • Baseline GAN (no physics, no EVT).  
   • Physics‐only GAN ($\beta=0$).  
   • EVT‐only GAN ($\alpha=0$).  
   • PI‐GAN (full objective).  
   For each, generate 2 000 synthetic extreme events per region (tropical, mid‐latitude, polar) for precipitation and temperature.  

8. Evaluation Metrics  
   8.1 Distributional Match:  
     – Kullback–Leibler divergence between real and generated marginal distributions at each cell.  
     – Quantile errors: $|Q_{\rm gen}(q)-Q_{\rm obs}(q)|$ for $q\in\{0.95,0.99,0.995\}$.  
   8.2 Physical Consistency:  
     – Mean squared violation of mass continuity: $\mathbb{E}\|\nabla\cdot(u,v)\|_2^2$.  
     – Mean energy residual: $\mathbb{E}\|\partial_t T + u\cdot\nabla T - Q_{\rm net}/(\rho c_p)\|_2^2$.  
   8.3 Spatio-Temporal Coherence:  
     – Spatial correlation length scales compared by variogram analysis.  
     – Temporal autocorrelation functions for $T$, $P$.  
   8.4 Downstream Impact Modeling:  
     – Train a flood‐risk classifier on real data only vs. real+synthetic extremes; measure uplift in precision/recall on an independent flood event dataset.  
   8.5 Uncertainty Quantification:  
     – Calibration of ensemble spread: rank histograms for synthetic ensembles vs. observations.  

Reproducibility and Compute:  
– Code and trained models will be released under an open‐source license.  
– Training performed on an HPC cluster with NVIDIA V100 GPUs; each full run requires ~72 hrs.
