## **1. Title: Physics-Informed Diffusion Models for Generating Physically Plausible High-Impact Low-Likelihood Climate Extremes**

## **2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Climate change represents one of the most significant challenges facing human civilization, with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems, economies, and societies. Accurate projections of future climate states, including changes in mean conditions, precipitation patterns, and particularly the frequency and intensity of extreme events, are crucial for effective adaptation and mitigation strategies (IPCC AR6). Earth System Models (ESMs), complex numerical simulations based on physical laws, have been the primary tool for these projections. However, ESMs face limitations, notably in their computational cost, which restricts spatial resolution, and their ability to accurately represent High Impact-Low Likelihood (HILL) events, such as unprecedented heatwaves, droughts, or floods (Shepherd, 2019). These events, often occurring at scales finer than typical climate model grids, are inherently difficult to simulate due to their rarity in the historical record used for model calibration and validation, like the commonly used ERA5 reanalysis dataset (Hersbach et al., 2020).

The machine learning (ML) community has recently made significant strides in weather and climate modeling. While AI-based weather forecasting models show operational promise (e.g., Hoyer et al., 2024), extending these successes to long-term climate projections, especially concerning extremes, remains a challenge. Generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, offer a promising avenue for synthesizing realistic climate data, potentially augmenting sparse observational records or exploring future scenarios (Boulaguiem et al., 2021; Li & Cao, 2024). However, purely data-driven generative models may struggle to produce physically consistent outputs, especially when extrapolating beyond the range of training data to simulate novel HILL events. Outputs might violate fundamental physical laws (e.g., conservation of mass or energy), limiting their credibility and utility for downstream applications like impact modeling.

Addressing this gap requires integrating physical knowledge into the ML framework. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and related techniques embed physical laws, often expressed as partial differential equations (PDEs), directly into the model architecture or learning process (Raissi et al., 2019). Recent work has explored physics-constrained generative models for fluid dynamics and weather forecasting (Tretiak et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2024), demonstrating improved physical realism. However, applying these principles specifically to generate *plausible future HILL climate extremes* considering spatio-temporal dynamics remains an active area of research highlighted by the focus of this workshop.

**2.2 Research Objectives**
This research aims to develop and validate a novel generative modeling framework capable of producing physically plausible, spatio-temporal data representing HILL climate extremes. We hypothesize that by explicitly incorporating physical constraints derived from fundamental atmospheric and thermodynamic principles into a state-of-the-art generative model (specifically, a Diffusion Model), we can generate realistic extreme event scenarios that, while potentially more intense or exhibiting novel patterns compared to the historical record, adhere to underlying physical laws.

The specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Physics-Informed Diffusion Model (PI-Diff):** Design and implement a conditional diffusion model capable of generating high-resolution spatio-temporal climate variable fields (e.g., temperature, precipitation, humidity). The model will incorporate physics-based constraints derived from conservation laws (mass, potentially energy/moisture) and thermodynamic relationships relevant to the target extreme events.
2.  **Generate Physically Plausible HILL Events:** Train the PI-Diff model on observational reanalysis and/or climate model output data (e.g., ERA5, CMIP6) and utilize its generative capabilities, potentially guided by conditioning on low-resolution inputs or specific large-scale conditions, to synthesize HILL events (e.g., extreme heatwaves, persistent heavy precipitation).
3.  **Validate Physical Consistency and Realism:** Rigorously evaluate the generated data, comparing the PI-Diff outputs against baseline generative models (without physics constraints) and existing datasets. Validation will focus on:
    *   Statistical properties (distribution tails, spatial/temporal correlations).
    *   Adherence to the targeted physical laws (quantifying residual errors).
    *   Plausibility of the synthesized extreme event characteristics (intensity, duration, spatial extent, dynamical evolution).
4.  **Assess Utility for Downstream Tasks:** Demonstrate the potential benefit of the generated synthetic extreme event data by using it to augment training sets for a representative downstream task, such as statistical impact modeling or extreme event detection/classification.

**2.3 Significance**
This research directly addresses key challenges outlined in the workshop call, leveraging deep generative models and physics-informed techniques to improve the representation of climate extremes in Earth system science. Successfully achieving the objectives will yield several significant contributions:

*   **Advancing ML for Climate Science:** It will provide a novel methodology for generating physically consistent climate data, particularly for rare but impactful events, pushing the boundaries of generative modeling in the Earth sciences.
*   **Improved Risk Assessment:** The ability to generate plausible HILL events, consistent with physical laws but potentially outside the observed record, can provide crucial insights into "tail risks" associated with climate change, leading to more robust risk assessments and adaptation planning.
*   **Data Augmentation:** The PI-Diff model can serve as a powerful tool to augment limited observational or simulation datasets of extreme events, potentially improving the training and performance of other ML models used for climate impact studies or prediction.
*   **Pathway to Hybrid Modeling:** Insights gained from integrating physics into generative models could inform the development of next-generation hybrid physics-ML climate models, where ML components respect fundamental physical principles.
*   **Addressing Data Scarcity:** This work directly tackles the challenge of data scarcity for HILL events, a major bottleneck identified in the literature (Key Challenge 1).

By focusing on physical plausibility alongside statistical realism, this research aims to build trust and enhance the utility of ML-generated climate data within the broader climate science and impact assessment communities.

## **3. Methodology**

**3.1 Research Design**
This research employs an iterative development and validation framework. We will focus primarily on Diffusion Models due to their demonstrated ability to generate high-fidelity images and time-series data and their relative training stability compared to GANs (Ho et al., 2020; Johnson & Lee, 2023). However, comparisons with physics-informed GAN variants (e.g., Yin et al., 2024; Blue & Red, 2024) may be included as baseline comparisons. The core idea is to embed physical constraints within the diffusion model's learning process or sampling procedure.

The research will proceed through the following stages:
1.  Data Curation and Preprocessing.
2.  PI-Diff Model Design and Implementation.
3.  Model Training and Tuning.
4.  Generation of Extreme Event Scenarios.
5.  Comprehensive Validation and Evaluation.
6.  Downstream Task Application (Proof-of-Concept).

**3.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing**
*   **Primary Dataset:** We will primarily use the ERA5 reanalysis dataset (Hersbach et al., 2020) due to its high spatio-temporal resolution and comprehensive coverage of atmospheric variables. We will focus on selected geographical regions known for specific types of extremes (e.g., Europe for heatwaves, Southeast Asia for extreme precipitation).
*   **Variables:** Key variables will include surface temperature (T2m), total precipitation (TP), specific humidity (q), sea level pressure (SLP), and potentially wind components (u10, v10) or geopotential height at relevant pressure levels (e.g., Z500).
*   **Resolution and Period:** We will utilize data at hourly or 3-hourly temporal resolution and spatial resolution of approximately 0.25°x0.25°. A long time period (e.g., 1979-present) will be used to capture climate variability, though acknowledging the rarity of target HILL events.
*   **Preprocessing:** Data will be preprocessed by:
    *   Selecting relevant variables and spatio-temporal domains.
    *   Normalizing or standardizing variable fields (e.g., Z-score normalization).
    *   Structuring data into spatio-temporal patches suitable for model input (e.g., sequences of 2D grids over several time steps).
*   **Extreme Event Definition:** We will pre-define specific HILL events based on established metrics (e.g., heatwaves defined by temperature exceeding the 99th percentile for a minimum duration; extreme precipitation events based on intensity thresholds over a specific accumulation period). These definitions will guide model conditioning and evaluation.

**3.3 PI-Diff Model Architecture and Physics Integration**
We propose a conditional Diffusion Model architecture, likely based on a U-Net backbone common in image generation and weather forecasting tasks (Ronneberger et al., 2015; Pathak et al., 2022).

*   **Diffusion Process:** The model learns to reverse a diffusion process that gradually adds Gaussian noise to the data $x_0$ over $T$ steps:
    $$ q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t I) $$
    where $\beta_t$ are small positive constants defining the noise schedule. The model learns the reverse process $p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t)$, typically by parameterizing the noise $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c)$ added at step $t$, often conditioned on context $c$ (e.g., time, coarse-resolution data, or large-scale weather state). The standard objective is often a simplified version of the variational lower bound, minimizing the difference between the true added noise and the predicted noise:
    $$ L_{simple}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \epsilon} [ || \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}\epsilon, t, c) ||^2 ] $$
    where $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{i=1}^t (1-\beta_i)$ and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.

*   **Physics Integration:** We will integrate physics constraints primarily through soft constraints in the loss function or by modifying the sampling process.
    1.  **Physics-Informed Loss Function:** We augment the standard diffusion loss $L_{simple}$ with a physics-based penalty term $L_{phys}$:
        $$ L_{total}(\theta) = L_{simple}(\theta) + \lambda_{phys} L_{phys}(\theta) $$
        where $\lambda_{phys}$ is a hyperparameter balancing the generative quality and physical consistency. $L_{phys}$ will penalize deviations from known physical laws evaluated on the *predicted denoised data* $\hat{x}_0 = (\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}\epsilon - \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}\epsilon_\theta) / \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}$ or directly on the model's noise prediction interpreting it in terms of tendencies. Physical laws include:
        *   **Mass Conservation (Continuity Equation):** For atmospheric flows, represented in 2D for surface variables or integrated forms. For example, penalizing non-zero divergence of vertically integrated moisture flux for precipitation generation. Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a differential operator representing the physical law (e.g., divergence $\nabla \cdot$). The loss term could be:
            $$ L_{phys}^{mass} = || \mathcal{D}(\hat{x}_0) ||^2 $$
            where the norm is computed over the spatial domain. Finite difference approximations will be used for discrete grids.
        *   **Thermodynamic Constraints:** Relationships like the Clausius-Clapeyron equation relating temperature and saturation vapor pressure, or simple energy balance considerations. For example, ensuring generated temperature and humidity fields are consistent.
            $$ L_{phys}^{thermo} = || f(T, q_{sat}) - q ||^2 $$
            where $f$ represents the expected relationship and $q$ is the generated humidity.
    2.  **Physics-Guided Sampling (Optional/Alternative):** Modify the reverse diffusion sampling step $p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t)$ to steer the generation towards physically consistent states (Kadkhodaie et al., 2021). This could involve projecting the intermediate state $x_{t-1}$ onto a manifold satisfying certain constraints after each sampling step, or adding a gradient term from the physics loss to the sampling update rule.

*   **Conditioning:** The model will be conditioned ($c$) on relevant information to guide the generation towards specific types of extremes or spatial locations. Conditioning variables could include:
    *   Low-resolution climate model fields (for physics-preserving downscaling).
    *   Large-scale climate indices (e.g., ENSO state, NAO index).
    *   Specific time/season information.
    *   An initial state from which the extreme event evolves.

**3.4 Model Training**
*   **Hardware:** Training will require significant GPU resources (e.g., NVIDIA A100 or H100 GPUs) due to the high dimensionality of spatio-temporal climate data and the complexity of diffusion models.
*   **Optimization:** We will use standard optimizers like Adam or AdamW with appropriate learning rate schedules.
*   **Hyperparameters:** Key hyperparameters ($\lambda_{phys}$, learning rate, batch size, diffusion timesteps $T$, noise schedule $\beta_t$, U-Net architecture details) will be tuned using a validation split of the data, prioritizing both generative quality (e.g., FID score, percepción visual) and physical consistency metrics (see below).
*   **Handling Data Imbalance:** Since HILL events are rare, the training data might be enriched by oversampling periods containing extremes, or the loss function might be weighted to give higher importance to accurately reproducing extreme values or physically constrained characteristics.

**3.5 Experimental Design and Validation**
We will conduct a rigorous evaluation comparing our PI-Diff model against several baselines:
*   **Baseline 1:** Standard conditional Diffusion Model (same architecture, $\lambda_{phys}=0$).
*   **Baseline 2:** A state-of-the-art conditional GAN (e.g., adapted from Yin et al., 2024 or Li & Cao, 2024), potentially with physics constraints implemented for fair comparison if feasible ($L_{phys}$ in discriminator/generator).
*   **Baseline 3:** Statistical methods for extremes (e.g., multivariate Extreme Value Theory models fitted to the training data).
*   **Reference:** Hold-out portion of the ERA5 dataset (or climate model data if used for training).

**Evaluation Metrics:**
1.  **Generative Quality & Distributional Similarity:**
    *   *Visual Inspection:* Qualitative assessment of generated fields by domain experts.
    *   *Marginal Distributions:* Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of key variables, focusing on the tails. Metrics: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Wasserstein distance ($W_1$).
    *   *Spatial Structure:* Power spectra, spatial autocorrelation functions. Metric: Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) adapted for climate fields (if applicable) or similar perceptual scores.
    *   *Temporal Dynamics:* Autocorrelation functions in time, cross-correlations between variables.
    *   *Probabilistic Skill:* Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) if generating probabilistic forecasts.
2.  **Physical Consistency:**
    *   *Constraint Residuals:* Directly compute the magnitude of violation for the specific physical laws included in $L_{phys}$ (e.g., average absolute divergence, energy imbalance) on generated samples. Compare PI-Diff vs. Baselines.
    *   *Inter-Variable Consistency:* Check known physical relationships between generated variables (e.g., geostrophic balance approximation, hydrostatic balance if applicable, temperature-humidity relations) even if not explicitly enforced.
3.  **Extreme Event Realism:**
    *   *Statistics of Extremes:* Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves, return level estimates for generated extremes compared to theoretical EVT fits on reference data.
    *   *Event Characteristics:* Compare statistics of generated extreme events (e.g., mean duration, spatial extent, peak intensity, propagation speed if relevant) against observed events in the reference dataset.
    *   *Plausibility Score:* Potentially develop a score based on expert assessment or composite metrics evaluating dynamical consistency and physical realism of novel generated extremes.
4.  **Uncertainty Quantification:**
    *   Generate ensembles of synthetic data by varying the initial noise seed in the diffusion process.
    *   Analyze the spread of the generated ensembles, particularly during extreme events, to characterize model uncertainty (related to Green & Black, 2023).

**3.6 Downstream Task Application (Proof-of-Concept)**
To demonstrate utility, we will select a simple downstream task relevant to climate impacts, e.g.:
*   **Statistical Crop Yield Model:** A simple regression model predicting crop yield based on climate inputs (temperature, precipitation). We will train this model with and without augmenting the training data with PI-Diff generated extremes and evaluate its performance, especially under extreme conditions.
*   **Extreme Event Classifier:** Train a classifier to detect specific extreme events (e.g., atmospheric rivers, heat domes) using standard data vs. augmented data.

Performance improvement on the downstream task (e.g., improved accuracy, F1-score, or reduced prediction error under extreme conditions) will indicate the value of the physically plausible synthetic data.

*   **Scientific Impact:** It will represent a significant step forward in the use of generative AI for climate science, providing a robust method to explore potential future extremes beyond the range of historical data while respecting fundamental physics. This contributes directly to the development of credible ML tools for Earth System Modeling and addresses key challenges like data scarcity and physical consistency (Challenges 1, 2, 5). The methodology could potentially be integrated into future hybrid physics-ML climate models (Hoyer et al., 2024; White & Brown, 2024).
*   **Societal Impact:** By enabling the generation of more realistic HILL event scenarios, this work can directly improve climate change risk assessment. Stakeholders in sectors like insurance, agriculture, urban planning, and disaster management can use these scenarios to develop more resilient infrastructure and effective adaptation strategies, ultimately reducing vulnerability to climate extremes.

The public release of code and potentially generated datasets would foster further research and application.

In summary, this project promises to deliver a scientifically rigorous and practically relevant contribution to the challenge of understanding and predicting high-impact climate extremes, leveraging the synergy between machine learning and physics-based knowledge to enhance our preparedness for future climate challenges.
