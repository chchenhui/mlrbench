**Key Challenges:**

1. **Data Scarcity of Extreme Events**: High Impact-Low Likelihood (HILL) events are rare, leading to limited observational data, which hampers the training and validation of generative models.

2. **Ensuring Physical Consistency**: Integrating physical laws and constraints into generative models is complex, yet essential to produce realistic and plausible climate scenarios.

3. **Model Generalization**: Developing models that generalize well across different regions and climate conditions remains a significant challenge due to the variability and complexity of climate systems.

4. **Computational Complexity**: Training physics-informed generative models requires substantial computational resources, especially when incorporating high-resolution spatio-temporal data.

5. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Accurately quantifying and reducing uncertainties in generated extreme event scenarios is crucial for reliable risk assessment and decision-making.
