Title: PhysFlow: Conditional Normalizing Flow for Physically-Consistent Stochastic Climate Downscaling

Motivation:  
High-resolution climate fields are essential for impact assessment and adaptation planning, yet global and regional models operate at coarse scales that omit critical subgrid variability. Existing statistical downscaling techniques often produce deterministic outputs without reliable uncertainty quantification or adherence to physical laws, limiting their utility for extreme event analysis.

Main Idea:  
We propose PhysFlow, a conditional normalizing flow that learns an invertible mapping from simple latent variables to high-resolution climate fields (e.g., precipitation, temperature) conditioned on coarse-resolution model outputs. By design, the flow provides exact likelihoods, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimates and ensemble generation of plausible scenarios. Physics is embedded via regularization penalties enforcing local conservation of mass and energy, plus divergence-smoothness constraints on wind fields. Training uses paired low/high-resolution datasets (ERA5 vs. convection-permitting simulations) to capture fine-scale patterns and extremes. We will benchmark PhysFlow against state-of-the-art downscaling methods on spatial correlation, extreme event frequency, and calibration metrics. PhysFlow aims to deliver rapid, physically consistent downscaling with quantified uncertainties, empowering more robust regional climate impact studies.
