**Title:** Physics-Informed Generative Adversarial Networks with Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification for Climate Projections  

**Motivation:** Climate projections require reliable extrapolation to unseen scenarios, such as extreme weather events or novel forcing conditions. Traditional AI models struggle with these tasks due to sparse data on rare events and decadal variability. Hybrid physics-ML models offer promise but often lack rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ), limiting their utility for risk assessment. Addressing this gap, we propose integrating physics-informed neural networks with probabilistic generative models to enhance predictive reliability while quantifying uncertainties in climate projections.  

**Main Idea:** We develop a physics-informed generative adversarial network (PI-GAN) augmented with Bayesian neural networks to enforce physical consistency (e.g., conservation laws) and quantify predictive uncertainty. The generator incorporates differentiable physics-based loss functions to ensure realistic climate dynamics, while the discriminator evaluates both physical plausibility and statistical fidelity. Bayesian inference (e.g., Monte Carlo dropout) is applied to estimate uncertainty in generated outputs, such as temperature or precipitation extremes. The model will be trained on historical data (e.g., CMIP6) and tested on simulating high-impact scenarios like El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability under future warming. Expected outcomes include improved representation of rare events, physically consistent downscaling, and uncertainty bounds critical for climate risk management. This approach bridges the gap between data-driven ML and physics-driven interpretability, enabling actionable climate projections with quantified confidence.
