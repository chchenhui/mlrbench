**Title:** Physics-Constrained Generative Adversarial Networks for High-Resolution Dynamical Downscaling in Climate Projections  

**Motivation:** Dynamical downscaling is critical for translating coarse climate model outputs into projections needed projections needed for adaptation planning. Traditional methods are computationally intensive and struggle to capture fine-scale processes, while existing ML approaches often neglect physical consistency, risking unreliable predictions. Bridging this gap is essential to deliver efficient, trustworthy regional climate insights.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a generative adversarial network (GAN) where the generator produces high-resolution climate variables (e.g., precipitation, temperature) from low-resolution inputs. The generator will integrate physics-based loss terms (e.g., energy conservation, mass balance) alongside adversarial training to ensure physical plausibility. A U-Net architecture will map coarse inputs to high-resolution fields, while the discriminator evaluates realism against observational data. Physics constraints will be enforced via PDE-based penalties during training. Transfer learning will adapt the model to regions with sparse high-resolution data by pretraining on data-rich areas. Outcomes include a scalable downscaling tool that balances computational efficiency with physical fidelity, validated against ERA5 reanalysis and traditional methods. This approach could enhance regional climate risk assessments, supporting infrastructure and policy decisions under climate change.
