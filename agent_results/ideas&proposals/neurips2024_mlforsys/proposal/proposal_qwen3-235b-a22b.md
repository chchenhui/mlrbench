# LLM-Driven Carbon-Aware Workload Scheduling for Cloud Computing  

## Introduction  

Cloud computing datacenters account for approximately 1-2% of global electricity consumption, with their carbon footprint continuing to rise alongside increasing demand for computational resources. While traditional workload scheduling algorithms focus on optimizing performance metrics (e.g., latency, throughput) and cost, they often neglect the environmental impact of energy consumption and carbon emissions. With growing corporate and regulatory pressure to achieve net-zero emissions, there is an urgent need for intelligent systems that integrate carbon intensity data, renewable energy forecasts, and workload characteristics into scheduling decisions.  

Existing approaches to carbon-aware scheduling primarily rely on heuristic-based algorithms or machine learning models trained on limited feature sets. For instance, PCAPS introduces carbon intensity as a factor in precedence-aware scheduling through dynamic programming, while CASPER proposes a distributed scheduling framework leveraging energy signal forecasts. However, these methods do not fully exploit the representational power of modern large language models (LLMs), which excel at capturing complex interdependencies between spatiotemporal variables, heterogeneous workloads, and real-time system states. Recent work by Mia et al. highlights the potential of AI-driven optimization in static cloud environments, but lacks dynamic adaptation and contextual reasoning required for real-time scheduling.  

This proposal aims to develop an LLM-driven system for carbon-aware workload scheduling that combines transformer-based architectures with reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize both carbon efficiency and SLA compliance. The key innovation lies in leveraging LLMs’ ability to learn from diverse data streams—such as grid-carbon intensity, workload patterns, and renewable energy availability—while adapting to real-time operational constraints. Compared to prior solutions, our framework offers three advantages: (1) holistic integration of temporal, spatial, and workload-specific signals through self-attention mechanisms; (2) online learning of scheduling policies via RL, enabling adaptability to changing energy signals and demand patterns; and (3) interpretability of decisions through natural language explanations generated by the LLM. We anticipate this system will achieve a 20-30% reduction in grid-based carbon emissions over existing carbon-aware strategies while preserving performance service-level agreements (SLAs) and cost efficiency.  

## Methodology  

### Data Collection and Preprocessing  

The system will be trained on heterogeneous datasets collected from cloud infrastructure telemetry and external sources:  

- **Workload Data**: Historical traces from production datacenters (e.g., Azure, Google) containing metadata on task types (batch, latency-sensitive, long-running), resource utilization (CPU, RAM, I/O), and dependency graphs.  
- **Carbon Intensity Data**: Real-time carbon signals from national grid monitors (e.g., Carbon Intensity API (UK National Grid ESO), OpenEI) capturing regional grid emission factors at 5-minute resolution.  
- **Renewable Energy Forecasts**: Hourly solar/wind output projections from sources like NASA’s GEOS-5 system or commercial APIs.  
- **Datacenter Infrastructure Metadata**: Power usage effectiveness (PUE), rack efficiency curves, and geographic locations.  

Data preprocessing steps will normalize grid carbon units (gCO2/kWh) across providers, impute missing values via Kalman filtering, and represent workload dependencies as digraphs encoded in DOT format. Temporal features will incorporate rolling window statistics (e.g., 7-day carbon mean), while spatial attributes will include geographic coordinates and regional grid zones.  

### Model Architecture  

The core system comprises two components:  

1. **LLM for Contextual Understanding (Fine-Tuned Foundation Model)**:  
   We will build on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Llama3, Mistral), repurposed for task-specific carbon-aware scheduling through domain adaptation. The model will be instructed to encode:  

   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{context}} = \Bigg[ (C_t^{(i)}, P_t^{(i)}, \Gamma_t^{(i)}, T_i) \xrightarrow{\text{LLM encoder}} \mathcal{E}_i \Bigg]_{i=1}^N
   $$

   where:  
   - $ C_t^{(i)} $: Carbon intensity at datacenter $ i $ at time $ t $  
   - $ P_t^{(i)} $: Power draw normalized to PUE  
   - $ \Gamma_t^{(i)} $: Renewable energy mix percentage at datacenter $ i $  
   - $ T_i $: Attributes of tasks (deadline, SLA, resource requirements)  
   - $ \mathcal{E}_i $: Latent embedding vector for decision-making  

2. **Reinforcement Learning Module for Policy Optimization**:  
   The LLM outputs embeddings to initialize an RL agent that selects optimal scheduling actions. Denote $ \pi_{\theta} $ as the policy network parameterized by $ \theta $, which generates an action $ a_t $ (datacenter assignment and execution time) given a state $ s_t $ (carbon context + active workloads):  

   $$
   a_t \sim \text{Softmax}(W_a \cdot \text{Tanh}(W_{\phi} \cdot s_t))
   $$

   The RL reward function combines carbon efficiency and SLA compliance:  

   $$
   r_t = -\left(W_{\text{carbon}} \cdot \text{CarbonImpact}(a_t) + W_{\text{SLA}} \cdot \mathbb{I}[\text{DeadlineMiss}] \right)
   $$

   where $ W_{\text{carbon}}, W_{\text{SLA}} $ are weighting coefficients determined by stakeholder priorities (e.g., carbon neutrality targets vs. uptime requirements). Training proceeds via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), with a CRITIC network estimating the value function $ V(s_t) $. The REINFORCE algorithm updates policy parameters:  

   $$
   \nabla J(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^T \nabla_{\theta} \log \pi_{\theta}(a_t | s_t) \cdot (G_t - b_{\phi}(s_t)) \right]
   $$

   where $ G_t = \sum_{k=t}^T \gamma^{k-t} r_k $ denotes discounted return and $ b_{\phi} $ is the baseline value network.  

### Implementation Details  

- **Execution Monitor**: A logging layer collects real-time outcomes (actual carbon emissions, SLA violations) to periodically retrain the LLM via parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (e.g., LoRA).  
- **Geospatial Indexing**: R-trees accelerate lookups of low-carbon regions during scheduling under deadline constraints.  
- **Hybrid Scheduling Engine**: Integrates LLM+RL with heuristic fallback methods (e.g., carbon-weighted Round Robin) for edge cases where LLM uncertainties exceed thresholds.  

### Evaluation Protocol  

We will benchmark against four categories of baselines:  

1. **Carbon-Agnostic Schedulers**:  
   - Round-Robin assignment  
   - Least-Loaded Allocation (LLA)  
2. **Carbon-Aware Heuristics**:  
   - PCAPS (precedence-constrained)  
   - CarbonScaler (elastic scaling)  
3. **ML-Based Schedulers**:  
   - CARBON (spatiotemporal)  
   - CLEVER (predictive batching)  
4. **LLM-Only Baseline**:  
   - LLM without RL optimization  

#### Metrics  

- **Primary Metric**:  
  - $ \frac{E_{\text{baseline}} - E_{\text{proposed}}}{E_{\text{baseline}}} \times 100 $: Relative carbon emission reduction  
- **Secondary Metrics**:  
  - SLA Violation Rate (% of delayed or failed tasks)  
  - Cost per Execution (weighted by energy prices)  
  - Training Efficiency (FLOPs and wall-clock training time)  

#### Experimental Setup  

- **Datasets**:  
  - Azure Batch Traces (Jan–Dec 2023)  
  - EPEX SPOT energy price and carbon signals (Europe)  
  - Google Cluster Data (2019) enriched with synthetic carbon metadata  
- **Evaluation Platform**:  
  - AWS EC2 c6i.8xlarge instances (32 vCPUs, Intel Ice Lake)  
  - Simulated Environment: Sedna for geospatial scheduling testbeds  

Statistical significance will be tested via Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for paired comparisons. Interpretability experiments will measure causality between scheduling decisions and carbon outcomes using integrated gradients on the LLM.  

## Expected Outcomes & Impact  

This research is projected to deliver three complementary outcomes:  

### **Novel LLM-Accelerated Carbon Optimization Framework**

The developed system will enable real-time scheduling decisions incorporating spatiotemporal signals and workload dependencies. Unlike deterministic systems like CarbonClipper’s linear programming formulation or heuristic methods (e.g., CarbonScaler), our LLM-based approach captures non-linear relationships between renewable energy variability and workload elasticity. We anticipate achieving 20-35% carbon emission reductions over state-of-the-art systems under medium-to-heavy loads (1000+ concurrent tasks), as quantified through Trivy Carbon Intensity Benchmark (TCIB) simulations.  

### **Online Learning Mechanism for System Adaptation**

By combining LLM pre-training with reinforcement learning feedback loops, the system will automatically adapt to shifts in energy supply patterns, hardware efficiency curves, and workload mixes. In stress testing scenarios where 30% of servers undergo PUE degradations, the model will learn to offload tasks to higher-efficiency nodes without centralized rule intervention.  

### **Carbon Intelligence Layer for Cloud Providers**

The system will provide cloud customers with visibility into workload carbon footprints through natural language summaries produced by the LLM. For instance:  

> "Job_4532 executed in Virginia datacenter due to solar surge (15% renewable increase), saving 420 kgCO2 versus standard schedule."  

Such explanations can satisfy emerging EU Corporate Sustainability Risk Reporting (CSRD) requirements while enabling cost-optimal computing strategies.  

The societal impact aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals 9 (Industry Innovation) and 13 (Climate Action). By operationalizing carbon-aware computing, this work advances green service differentiation in hyperscale cloud platforms—a $300B market. Quantifiably, if deployed across 10% of global public cloud capacity, the system could reduce annual emissions by 1.5M metric tons, equivalent to removing 326k gasoline cars from roads each year.
