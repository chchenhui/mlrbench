**Title:** **Energy-Aware Job Scheduling with Reinforcement Learning and Carbon-Aware Workload Prediction**  

**Motivation:**  
Data centers account for ~2% of global electricity consumption, with growing environmental and economic costs. Traditional heuristic-based scheduling fails to adapt to dynamic workloads, energy prices, and real-time carbon intensity variations. Existing ML approaches often ignore temporal correlations in workload patterns or external factors like renewable energy availability. This work addresses the urgent need for intelligent systems that holistically optimize energy efficiency, cost, and carbon footprint in large-scale computing environments.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for job scheduling that jointly optimizes energy consumption, carbon emissions, and service-level objectives (SLOs). The system uses a hybrid model combining:  
1. A **graph neural network (GNN)** to predict job resource demands and dependencies using historical workload traces.  
2. A **transformer-based model** to forecast real-time carbon intensity of energy grids and electricity prices.  
3. An RL agent trained via proximal policy optimization (PPO) to dynamically allocate resources, prioritize jobs, and migrate workloads to regions with cleaner/cheaper energy.  

The framework will be evaluated on Kubernetes clusters with real-world workloads (e.g., Google Cluster Data), benchmarking against heuristic schedulers (e.g., Kubernetes default) and existing ML approaches. Expected outcomes include 20â€“30% reductions in energy use and carbon footprint while maintaining SLO compliance. This work bridges ML and systems research, enabling scalable, sustainable cloud computing aligned with global decarbonization goals.
