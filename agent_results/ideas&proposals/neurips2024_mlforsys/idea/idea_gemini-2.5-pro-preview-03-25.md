**Title:** Carbon-Intensity-Aware Dynamic Power Management via Reinforcement Learning

**Motivation:** Datacenter energy consumption is a major contributor to carbon emissions. Traditional power management often focuses solely on minimizing energy use, neglecting the significant temporal variations in the carbon intensity of the electricity grid. We need intelligent, adaptive strategies that optimize for actual carbon footprint in real-time.

**Main Idea:** We propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for dynamic power management in servers or clusters. The RL agent's state includes current workload metrics, predicted near-term workload, real-time grid carbon intensity forecasts, and Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Actions involve adjusting power states (e.g., Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), core C-states). The reward function explicitly penalizes estimated carbon emissions (energy consumed * current carbon intensity) while penalizing SLO violations. This approach allows the system to learn complex policies, potentially reducing power consumption aggressively during periods of high carbon intensity and prioritizing performance when the grid is cleaner, thereby minimizing the overall carbon footprint beyond simple energy minimization.
