### Title: "Optimizing Compiler Partitioning with Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale LLM Training"

### Motivation:
As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient training and serving have become critical challenges. Current compiler partitioning schemes often rely on static heuristics, which may not adapt well to dynamic workloads and resource constraints. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising approach to dynamically optimize partitioning schemes, potentially leading to more efficient use of resources and reduced training times.

### Main Idea:
This research proposes the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to dynamically optimize compiler partitioning schemes for large-scale LLM training across thousands of GPU or TPU devices. The RL agent will learn to make partitioning decisions based on real-time feedback from the training process, such as resource utilization, training progress, and energy consumption. The agent will be trained using a reward function that balances training speed, resource efficiency, and energy consumption.

The methodology involves:
1. **Environment Design**: Developing a simulated environment that mimics the LLM training process, including GPU/TPU resource allocation and training dynamics.
2. **RL Agent Development**: Implementing an RL agent using techniques like Deep Q-Learning or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn optimal partitioning strategies.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: Training the RL agent on the simulated environment and evaluating its performance on real-world LLM training datasets.
4. **Deployment and Monitoring**: Deploying the trained RL agent in a production setting and continuously monitoring its performance to ensure it adapts to changing conditions.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved training efficiency and reduced training times for LLMs.
- Enhanced resource utilization, leading to cost savings and reduced carbon footprint.
- A more adaptive and resilient partitioning scheme that can handle dynamic workloads and resource constraints.

Potential impact:
This research could significantly advance the field of ML for systems by demonstrating the practical application of RL to optimize critical components of large-scale LLM training. It has the potential to set new standards for energy-efficient and cost-effective LLM training, contributing to the broader goal of sustainable computing.
