**Title:** Carbon-Aware Dynamic Workload Scheduling Using Federated Reinforcement Learning  

**Motivation:** Data centers contribute significantly to global carbon emissions, yet current power management strategies often rely on static heuristics that ignore real-time carbon intensity variations across regions and time. This research aims to reduce the carbon footprint of large-scale compute clusters by dynamically aligning workloads with renewable energy availability, addressing both sustainability and operational efficiency.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a federated reinforcement learning (FRL) framework that optimizes workload scheduling across distributed data centers based on real-time carbon intensity predictions and job priorities. The system will train local RL agents at each data center to predict workload demands and regional carbon trends (using time-series models), while a global FRL model aggregates insights without sharing sensitive operational data. The framework will balance latency, cost, and carbon efficiency by shifting non-urgent workloads to times/locations with lower carbon intensity (e.g., when solar/wind generation peaks). Expected outcomes include a 15â€“30% reduction in carbon emissions per compute unit and adaptive policies for diverse grid conditions. Impact includes scalable, privacy-preserving sustainability solutions for cloud providers.
