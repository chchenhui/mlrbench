**1. Title: Dynamic Adversarial Training for Robust and Imperceptible Watermarking of Generative AI Content**

**2. Introduction**

*   **Background:** The rapid advancement of generative AI (GenAI) models, capable of producing high-fidelity images, text, audio, and video, presents transformative opportunities across numerous sectors. However, the ease with which synthetic content can be created also raises significant concerns regarding authenticity, intellectual property (IP) protection, and the potential for malicious use, such as disinformation campaigns or unauthorized replication. Digital watermarking, the process of embedding covert information within generated content, has emerged as a critical technology for establishing provenance, verifying authenticity, and tracking the distribution of AI-generated assets.

    Existing watermarking techniques for GenAI, such as those proposed by Xu et al. (2024) for images (InvisMark) and Zhao et al. (2023) or Zhang et al. (2023) for text, have demonstrated promise in embedding information imperceptibly while maintaining content quality. Methods like those by Pautov et al. (2025) focus on embedding during inference to avoid retraining, while others like Cui et al. (2025) inject fictitious knowledge during training for robust text watermarking. However, a major persistent challenge, highlighted across the literature (Jiang et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024), is the **robustness** of these watermarks against adversarial attacks. Attackers may actively seek to remove, degrade, or forge watermarks using various manipulations, ranging from simple post-processing (e.g., compression, noise addition, cropping) to more sophisticated, adaptive attacks designed to exploit specific weaknesses of the embedding algorithm. Current methods often rely on predefined robustness constraints or static defense mechanisms, making them potentially vulnerable to unseen or adaptive attack strategies. Failure to ensure watermark resilience undermines trust in GenAI systems and hinders their adoption in sensitive applications like media forensics, secure content distribution, and compliance with emerging regulations. The work by Thakkar et al. (2023) touches upon integrating adversarial training, but a dedicated framework dynamically co-adapting watermark embedding and attack simulation is underexplored for GenAI watermarking specifically aiming for generalization.

*   **Research Objectives:** This research aims to develop and evaluate a novel watermarking framework for GenAI content (initially focusing on images, with potential extension to text) that achieves high robustness against a wide range of adversarial attacks, including adaptive ones, while maintaining high imperceptibility and content fidelity. The core objectives are:
    1.  **Develop a Dynamic Adversarial Training (DAT) framework:** Design and implement a framework where a watermark embedder/detector system is co-trained with a dynamic suite of adversarial attack models.
    2.  **Enhance Watermark Robustness:** Demonstrate that the DAT framework significantly improves watermark resilience against both standard image/signal processing manipulations and sophisticated, learned adversarial attacks compared to state-of-the-art static watermarking methods.
    3.  **Maintain Imperceptibility and Fidelity:** Ensure that the embedded watermarks remain statistically imperceptible and do not degrade the perceptual quality or semantic integrity of the original AI-generated content.
    4.  **Evaluate Generalization:** Assess the ability of the DAT-trained watermark system to withstand novel, unseen adversarial attack strategies not explicitly included in the training loop.
    5.  **Benchmark Performance:** Rigorously evaluate the proposed method using standardized datasets, metrics, and attack scenarios, providing a comprehensive comparison against leading baseline techniques.

*   **Significance:** This research directly addresses a critical bottleneck in the trustworthy deployment of GenAI â€“ the vulnerability of content provenance mechanisms. By developing watermarks robust to adaptive adversaries, this work will:
    *   **Enhance Trust and Authenticity:** Provide more reliable means to verify the origin and integrity of AI-generated content, crucial for combating misinformation and deepfakes.
    *   **Strengthen IP Protection:** Offer content creators and owners more resilient tools to protect their assets generated or augmented by AI.
    *   **Align with Industry Needs:** Meet the demand for scalable and secure watermarking solutions in sectors like media, publishing, and creative industries, as highlighted by the GenAI Watermarking workshop scope.
    *   **Contribute Algorithmic Advances:** Introduce a novel DAT-based approach to the field of GenAI watermarking, potentially inspiring similar robustness-enhancement techniques in related AI security domains.
    *   **Inform Evaluation Standards:** Contribute to the development of more comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating watermark robustness, particularly against adaptive threats.

**3. Methodology**

This research proposes a Dynamic Adversarial Training (DAT) framework specifically tailored for enhancing the robustness of watermarks in generative AI content, initially focusing on images generated by diffusion models or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The framework involves the simultaneous, iterative optimization of a watermark embedding/detection system and a suite of adversarial attack models.

*   **Framework Overview:**
    The core components of the DAT framework are:
    1.  **Watermark Embedder ($E$):** A neural network (e.g., U-Net architecture or similar encoder-decoder structure) that takes an original AI-generated image $I$ and a secret message $m$ (binary string of length $k$) as input and outputs a watermarked image $I_w = E(I, m)$. The goal of $E$ is to embed $m$ into $I$ such that $I_w$ is perceptually indistinguishable from $I$, and the embedded message $m$ can be reliably recovered even after $I_w$ undergoes adversarial attacks.
    2.  **Watermark Detector ($D$):** A neural network (e.g., a classification CNN) that takes a potentially distorted image $I'$ (which could be $I_w$ or an attacked version $A(I_w)$) as input and outputs the estimated embedded message $\hat{m} = D(I')$. The goal of $D$ is to accurately recover $m$ from $I'$.
    3.  **Adversarial Attack Suite ($\mathcal{A} = \{A_1, A_2, ..., A_N\}$):** A collection of attack operators. This suite includes:
        *   *Fixed, Differentiable Approximations of Standard Attacks:* Common image manipulations like JPEG compression, Gaussian noise addition, blurring, resizing, cropping, rotations implemented in a differentiable manner where possible.
        *   *Learned Adversarial Attack Models:* One or more neural networks, potentially parameterized differently (e.g., focusing on different perturbation norms or objectives), trained specifically to remove or obscure the watermark. These adversaries $A_i \in \mathcal{A}$ take $I_w$ as input and produce an attacked image $I'_i = A_i(I_w)$. Their goal is to maximize the detection error of $D$ while minimizing the perceptual difference between $I'_i$ and $I_w$ (or $I$).

*   **Data Collection and Generation:**
    *   We will utilize large-scale standard image datasets like ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) and MS-COCO (Lin et al., 2014) as source material.
    *   High-fidelity generative models, such as pre-trained Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) or StyleGAN variants (Karras et al., 2019), will be used to generate the base images $I$ that will be watermarked. This ensures the research is relevant to contemporary GenAI outputs.
    *   Watermark messages $m$ will be randomly generated binary strings of a fixed length (e.g., $k=64$ or $k=256$ bits, aligning with capacities seen in works like InvisMark).

*   **Algorithmic Steps and Mathematical Formulation:**
    The DAT framework operates through an iterative min-max optimization process.

    1.  **Initialization:** Initialize the parameters of the embedder $E_{\theta}$, detector $D_{\phi}$, and learned adversaries $A_{\psi_i}$.
    2.  **Iterative Training:** Repeat the following steps for a set number of epochs or until convergence:
        *   **(a) Embedder/Detector Optimization:** Freeze the parameters $\psi_i$ of the adversaries $A_i$. Sample a batch of original images $\{I^{(j)}\}$ and random messages $\{m^{(j)}\}$. Generate watermarked images $I_w^{(j)} = E_{\theta}(I^{(j)}, m^{(j)})$. Apply attacks from the current suite $\mathcal{A}$ (both fixed and learned adversaries) to get attacked images $I'^{(j)}_{i} = A_i(I_w^{(j)})$. Optimize $\theta$ and $\phi$ to minimize a combined loss function $\mathcal{L}_{E,D}$:
            $$
            \mathcal{L}_{E,D} = \lambda_{p} \mathcal{L}_{perceptual} + \lambda_{r} \mathcal{L}_{robustness}
            $$
            where:
            *   **Perceptual Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{perceptual}$):** Ensures $I_w$ is close to $I$. This can be a combination of pixel-wise losses (MSE, L1), structural similarity (SSIM), and perceptual metrics like LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018).
                $$
                \mathcal{L}_{perceptual}(I, I_w) = w_1 ||I - I_w||_2^2 + w_2 (1 - SSIM(I, I_w)) + w_3 LPIPS(I, I_w)
                $$
            *   **Robustness Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{robustness}$):** Encourages correct message recovery by the detector $D$ after attacks. This involves averaging the detection loss over all attacks in the suite $\mathcal{A}$. Using Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) for bit-wise detection:
                $$
                \mathcal{L}_{robustness}(E, D, \mathcal{A}) = \mathbb{E}_{I, m} \left[ \frac{1}{|\mathcal{A}|} \sum_{A_i \in \mathcal{A}} BCE(D_{\phi}(A_i(E_{\theta}(I, m))), m) \right]
                $$
            The gradients are computed and parameters $\theta, \phi$ are updated (e.g., using Adam optimizer).

        *   **(b) Adversary Optimization:** Freeze the parameters $\theta, \phi$ of the embedder $E$ and detector $D$. For each learned adversary $A_{\psi_i}$, optimize its parameters $\psi_i$ to *maximize* the detection error (minimize robustness from the embedder's perspective) while constraining the distortion introduced by the attack. The objective for adversary $A_i$ is:
            $$
            \mathcal{L}_{adv}(A_i) = - BCE(D_{\phi}(A_{\psi_i}(I_w)), m) + \gamma \mathcal{L}_{distortion}(I_w, A_{\psi_i}(I_w))
            $$
            where $I_w = E_{\theta}(I, m)$ (computed with fixed $\theta$). $\mathcal{L}_{distortion}$ penalizes large changes to the image (e.g., using MSE or LPIPS) to ensure the attack remains somewhat realistic or stealthy. The term $\gamma$ controls the trade-off between attack effectiveness and distortion. The adversary aims to *minimize* $\mathcal{L}_{adv}$. Gradients are computed w.r.t $\psi_i$, and parameters are updated.

    This min-max game, formalized as:
    $$
    \min_{\theta, \phi} \max_{\psi_1, ..., \psi_N} \left( \lambda_{p} \mathcal{L}_{perceptual} + \lambda_{r} \mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{1}{|\mathcal{A}|} \sum_{A_i} BCE(D_{\phi}(A_{\psi_i}(E_{\theta}(I, m))), m) \right] - \sum_i \gamma_i \mathcal{L}_{distortion}(I_w, A_{\psi_i}(I_w)) \right)
    $$
    (Note: The exact formulation combines objectives carefully, often alternating optimization steps rather than solving the full min-max simultaneously). This process encourages the embedder $E$ to find embedding strategies that are robust against the *strongest* attacks the current adversaries $A_i$ can devise, while the adversaries continuously adapt to find new vulnerabilities.

*   **Experimental Design:**
    *   **Baselines:** We will compare our DAT-trained watermarking system against several state-of-the-art methods, including:
        *   InvisMark (Xu et al., 2024) - Represents high-imperceptibility, robust methods.
        *   Certifiably Robust Image Watermark (Jiang et al., 2024) - Represents methods with theoretical guarantees against specific threats.
        *   A standard (non-adversarially trained) robust watermarking scheme (e.g., HiDDeN (Zhu et al., 2018) or a variant trained without the adversarial loop).
        *   Potentially VINE (Lu et al., 2024) if applicable to the generative models used.
    *   **Datasets:** Experiments will be conducted on images generated based on ImageNet and MS-COCO validation sets. We will likely use ~10k-50k images for training and a separate ~1k-5k images for evaluation.
    *   **Evaluation Metrics:**
        *   **Imperceptibility/Fidelity:** Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). We aim for high PSNR (>40 dB), high SSIM (>0.98), and low LPIPS. We may also use CLIP score (Hessel et al., 2021) to assess semantic fidelity if applicable.
        *   **Robustness:** Watermark Bit Error Rate (BER) or Detection Accuracy (%) under a wide range of attacks. The attack suite for *evaluation* will include:
            *   Standard distortions (not used in training if testing generalization): Various JPEG quality factors, Gaussian noise levels, median filtering, blurring, resizing, cropping (center, random), rotations, color jittering.
            *   Attacks *seen* during training: The fixed differentiable attacks and attacks generated by the *final* learned adversaries $A_i$.
            *   *Unseen* Adversarial Attacks: We will employ standard projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks targeting the final detector $D$ (if accessible), or potentially use third-party watermark removal tools/algorithms as black-box attacks to assess generalization to genuinely unseen threats. Comparison will be made based on BER/Accuracy under each attack condition.
        *   **Payload Capacity:** The number of bits ($k$) embedded per image. We will target capacities like $k=64, 128, 256$.
        *   **Computational Cost:** Training time convergence analysis and inference time for embedding ($E$) and detection ($D$).
    *   **Ablation Studies:**
        *   Effectiveness of DAT: Compare performance against the same E/D architecture trained without the adversarial loop (Step 2b).
        *   Impact of Adversary Diversity: Evaluate the contribution of using multiple learned adversaries versus a single one, and the impact of including fixed distortion layers.
        *   Trade-off Analysis: Analyze the relationship between robustness (BER under attack), imperceptibility (PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS), and payload capacity ($k$) by varying loss weights ($\lambda_p, \lambda_r, \gamma$) and message length.
        *   Generalization Test: Explicitly measure performance drop between attacks seen during training and genuinely unseen attacks (e.g., different parameterizations or types of attacks).

This research directly tackles the core challenge of **adversarial robustness** identified in the literature and workshop topics. By explicitly training against adaptive adversaries, it aims to overcome the limitations of static defenses and improve **generalization** to unseen attacks. The **evaluation** methodology proposed is comprehensive, addressing the need for standardized **benchmarks** and metrics. Ultimately, this work seeks to provide a significant **algorithmic advance S** in GenAI watermarking, enhancing its practical utility and reliability.

**(Self-Correction during thought process):** Initial thoughts might just focus on training against *one* adversary. Realized that a *suite* of diverse adversaries (fixed + learned, potentially different objectives) is likely more effective for generalization, similar to ensemble methods in adversarial training for classification. Also ensured the evaluation plan explicitly includes testing against *unseen* attacks, which is crucial for validating the generalization claim of the dynamic framework. Made sure to explicitly link the proposal back to the workshop themes and the challenges identified in the provided literature review. Added specific baseline papers from the literature review to make the comparison concrete. Clarified the mathematical formulation of the min-max objective and the iterative training steps. Added computational cost as an evaluation metric for practical considerations. Emphasized both image quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM) and perceptual metrics (LPIPS, potentially CLIP) as fidelity measures. Targeted ~2000 words. Final check placed around 2100 words, which is acceptable.
