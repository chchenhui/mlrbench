### Title: "Interpretable Time Series Representation Learning for Pediatric Healthcare"

### Motivation:
Pediatric healthcare presents unique challenges in time series analysis due to the small sample size, high dimensionality, and the need for interpretable models. Current methods often lack the robustness and interpretability required for clinical decision-making. This research aims to develop interpretable time series representation learning techniques that can handle the specific challenges of pediatric data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of diagnoses and treatment plans.

### Main Idea:
This research proposes a novel approach to time series representation learning that incorporates clinical domain knowledge to enhance interpretability and robustness. The methodology involves:
1. **Domain Knowledge Integration:** Incorporating expert knowledge through a hybrid model that combines clinical rules and data-driven representations.
2. **Explainable AI (XAI):** Developing explainable models that provide clear insights into the learned representations, enabling clinicians to understand the underlying patterns and make informed decisions.
3. **Robustness to Missing Data and Outliers:** Implementing robust statistical techniques to handle missing values and outliers, which are common in pediatric time series data.
4. **Multimodal Data Fusion:** Creating a framework to integrate data from various modalities (e.g., vital signs, lab tests) to capture comprehensive patient information.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved diagnostic accuracy and reliability in pediatric healthcare.
- Enhanced interpretability, allowing clinicians to trust and act upon the model's predictions.
- Increased robustness to real-world data challenges, such as missing values and high dimensionality.

Potential impact:
- This research could revolutionize pediatric healthcare by providing more accurate and interpretable tools for clinicians.
- It could lead to better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs by enabling earlier and more precise diagnoses and treatment plans.
