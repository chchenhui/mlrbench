# Dynamic Knowledge-Graph-Infused Adapters for Scalable Continual Learning

## Introduction

### Background  
Foundation models (FMs) pre-trained on static datasets face critical bottlenecks in dynamic real-world scenarios, where knowledge evolves and compute resources are constrained. Full retraining incurs prohibitively high costs, while fine-tuning often triggers **catastrophic forgetting**—irreversible loss of previously acquired knowledge. Continual learning (CL) aims to address this by enabling incremental adaptation to new tasks without retraining the entire model. However, existing CL methods struggle at scale due to interference between tasks, inefficient knowledge transfer, and inability to handle long-tailed or shifted distributions in real-world data.

### Research Objectives  
This proposal introduces **Dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG)-Infused Adapters**, a scalable CL framework that:  
1. Mitigates catastrophic forgetting by encoding knowledge in a persistent, structured form.  
2. Reduces computational costs via parameter-efficient adaptation using adapter modules.  
3. Enables robust generalization in domain-shifted and long-tailed settings by retrieving relevant facts from a dynamically updated KG.  

### Significance  
By integrating structured knowledge into continual adaptation, this work advances scalable CL for several emerging applications:  
- **Lifelong knowledge accumulation**: Enables FMs to incorporate new facts (e.g., medical breakthroughs) without overwriting prior expertise.  
- **Efficiency gains**: Achieves compute savings by updating <1% of model parameters compared to full fine-tuning.  
- **Robustness to domain shifts**: Uses KG-based reasoning to stabilize performance when training data diverges from pretraining distributions (e.g., pandemic-related topics post-COVID datasets).  

Our approach bridges critical gaps in the interplay between structured knowledge and CL, offering a scalable path toward real-world deployable FMs.

## Methodology

### Overview  
Our framework combines **lightweight transformer adapters** with a **dynamic KG** that grows incrementally with new data. As new tasks arrive, the model:  
1. Updates the KG with a subgraph containing novel entities/relation triplets.  
2. Uses cross-attention in the adapter to retrieve relevant KG facts during adaptation.  
3. Prunes redundant nodes via periodic graph consolidation.  

This architecture ensures knowledge-preserved updates while minimizing computational overhead (Fig. 1).

### Technical Components  

#### Adapter Architecture with Cross-Attention  
We inject a cross-attention layer into standard transformer adapters (Fig. 2). Let $ H_t \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d} $ denote the adapter's hidden states for sequence length $ L $ and embedding dimension $ d $. Given a task-specific input, the model retrieves relevant facts from the KG using:  

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

where $ Q = W_q H_t $, $ K = E_{\text{KG}}, V = E_{\text{KG}} $, and $ E_{\text{KG}} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d} $ are dynamically stored KG entity embeddings. The output $ \hat{H}_t $ merges retrieved knowledge with the adapter's context:  

$$
\hat{H}_t = \text{LayerNorm}\left(H_t + \text{CrossAttention}(Q, K, V)\right)
$$

This allows selective knowledge infusion without altering the base model parameters.

#### Dynamic Knowledge Graph Construction  
The KG evolves as new tasks arrive:  
1. **Subgraph Addition**: For task $ i $, extract triplets $ \{(e_h^j, r^j, e_t^j)\} $ from input data using a domain-specific ontology. For example, in medical NLP, entity $ e_h $ might be a drug name, $ r $ the relation *treats*, and $ e_t $ a disease. New entities are appended to a hierarchical type hierarchy (e.g., MeSH categories).  
2. **Incremental LoRA Embeddings**: Update $ E_{\text{KG}} $ with low-rank matrices $ \Delta_i \in \mathbb{R}^{N_i \times k} $ (rank $ k \ll d $), where $ N_i $ is the number of new entities in task $ i $. This follows the method of Liu et al. (2024) to avoid recomputing full embeddings.

---

#### Sparse Retrieval Mechanism  
To maintain efficiency, only the most relevant subgraphs are accessed:  
- **Scoring Function**: Compute relevance scores $ s(n) = Q \cdot e_n $ for each entity $ e_n \in E_{\text{KG}} $.  
- **Top-k Traversal**: Retain only the top-$ k $ nodes and their neighbors for cross-attention, reducing the effective size of $ K $ and $ V $.  
- **Cache Update**: Nodes with relevance score $ s(n) > \tau $ are cached locally for faster retrieval in subsequent tasks.

---

#### Graph Consolidation Strategy  
To prevent unbounded KG growth, we:  
1. **Merge Nodes**: Use cosine similarity $ \cos(e_i, e_j) > \theta $ to identify redundant entities from different tasks.  
2. **Prune Rare Nodes**: Remove entities that appear in < $ \eta $ tasks, assuming they represent noise or ephemeral knowledge.  

---

### Training Protocol  
For each incoming task $ i $:  
1. Extract and add triplets $ \{(e_h, r, e_t)\}_i $ to the KG.  
2. For training batch $ B $:  
   - Forward pass through base model.  
   - Compute adapter output $ \hat{H}_t $ using Equation (2).  
   - Optimize task-specific loss $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} $ (e.g., cross-entropy).  
3. Periodically perform graph consolidation.

### Experimental Design  

#### Datasets  
1. **CLiMB** (Multimodal Visual Question Answering): Sequences of tasks testing knowledge transfer across vision-language domains.  
2. **DomainShift-GLUE**: Subset of GLUE tasks (e.g., MNLI, SST-2) arranged in time-ordered splits (e.g., pre-COVID → post-COVID news data).  
3. **TailMeier** (Long-Tailed NLP): Synthetic subset of Wikipedia with Zipfian-distributed entities.  

#### Baselines  
- Full fine-tuning (FT)  
- EWC (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017)  
- Adapter-only CL (Pfeiffer et al., 2021)  
- I2I (Srinivasan et al., 2023)  
- Incremental LoRA (Liu et al., 2024)  

#### Evaluation Metrics  
1. **Accuracy**: Task-specific accuracy on test sets.  
2. **Backward Transfer (BWT)**: Change in performance on older tasks after new task adaptation.  
3. **Resource Efficiency**:  
   - Parameter efficiency: Number of updated parameters (% vs. FT).  
   - Speed: Wall-clock training time per task.  
4. **Robustness**: F1-score on domain-shifted and long-tailed subsets.  

#### Ablation Studies  
- Effect of $ k $ (sparse retrieval cutoff) on performance.  
- Impact of $ \theta $ and $ \eta $ (consolidation hyperparameters).  
- Contribution of cross-attention versus adapter-only variants.

This framework not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also provides a blueprint for integrating structured priors into lifelong learning systems. Future work will explore self-supervised triplet extraction and applications in low-resource languages. By aligning theoretical rigor with real-world needs, our proposal charts a path toward truly dynamic foundation models that evolve with human knowledge.
