1. **Title**: Linked Adapters: Linking Past and Future to Present for Effective Continual Learning (arXiv:2412.10687)
   - **Authors**: Dupati Srikar Chandra, P. K. Srijith, Dana Rezazadegan, Chris McCarthy
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces Linked Adapters, a novel approach that employs a weighted attention mechanism to facilitate knowledge transfer across task-specific adapters in continual learning. By modeling attention weights with a multi-layer perceptron, the method addresses both forward and backward knowledge transfer, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Experiments on diverse image classification datasets demonstrate improved performance in continual learning tasks.

2. **Title**: Fast and Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding via Incremental LoRA (arXiv:2407.05705)
   - **Authors**: Jiajun Liu, Wenjun Ke, Peng Wang, Jiahao Wang, Jinhua Gao, Ziyu Shang, Guozheng Li, Zijie Xu, Ke Ji, Yining Li
   - **Summary**: The authors propose a fast continual knowledge graph embedding framework that incorporates an incremental low-rank adapter mechanism to efficiently acquire new knowledge while preserving existing information. The approach isolates and allocates new knowledge to specific layers based on the fine-grained influence between old and new knowledge graphs, and employs adaptive rank allocation to adjust the importance of entities. Experiments demonstrate significant reductions in training time while maintaining competitive link prediction performance.

3. **Title**: I2I: Initializing Adapters with Improvised Knowledge (arXiv:2304.02168)
   - **Authors**: Tejas Srinivasan, Furong Jia, Mohammad Rostami, Jesse Thomason
   - **Summary**: This work presents I2I, a continual learning algorithm that initializes adapters for new tasks by distilling knowledge from previously learned task adapters. The method facilitates cross-task knowledge transfer without incurring additional parametric costs. Evaluations on the CLiMB benchmark, involving sequences of visual question answering tasks, show that I2I consistently achieves better task accuracy compared to independently trained adapters.

4. **Title**: K-Adapter: Infusing Knowledge into Pre-Trained Models with Adapters (arXiv:2002.01808)
   - **Authors**: Ruize Wang, Duyu Tang, Nan Duan, Zhongyu Wei, Xuanjing Huang, Jianshu Ji, Guihong Cao, Daxin Jiang, Ming Zhou
   - **Summary**: The authors introduce K-Adapter, a framework that injects knowledge into large pre-trained models like BERT and RoBERTa using neural adapters. Each adapter corresponds to a specific type of knowledge, such as factual or linguistic, and operates independently to prevent interference. This design allows for efficient training and supports the development of versatile knowledge-infused models. Experiments on knowledge-driven tasks demonstrate performance improvements and the effective capture of diverse knowledge types.

**Key Challenges**:

1. **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Continual learning models often struggle to retain previously learned information when adapting to new tasks, leading to the loss of prior knowledge.

2. **Efficient Knowledge Transfer**: Developing mechanisms that enable effective transfer of knowledge across tasks without incurring significant computational overhead remains a challenge.

3. **Scalability**: As models grow in size and complexity, ensuring that continual learning methods scale efficiently without excessive resource consumption is critical.

4. **Integration of Structured Knowledge**: Incorporating structured knowledge sources, such as knowledge graphs, into continual learning frameworks requires careful design to balance knowledge infusion and model adaptability.

5. **Evaluation Protocols**: Establishing standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of continual learning models across diverse tasks and domains is essential for measuring progress and identifying areas for improvement.
