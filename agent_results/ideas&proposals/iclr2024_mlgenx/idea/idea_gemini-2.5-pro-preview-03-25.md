**Title:** Causal Graph Discovery from Perturbation Data for Target Identification

**Motivation:** Identifying causal drivers of disease from observational omics data is confounded by hidden variables and feedback loops. Perturbation experiments (e.g., CRISPR screens, drug treatments) offer interventional data crucial for causal inference, but integrating diverse perturbation types and readouts to build robust causal gene regulatory networks remains challenging.

**Main Idea:** We propose a framework combining causal inference methods with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn a causal graph of gene interactions directly from multimodal perturbation data (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics post-perturbation). The model will leverage the interventional nature of the data, potentially using techniques like invariant causal prediction or structural causal models adapted for high-dimensional biological settings. By integrating readouts across different perturbation types (gene knockouts, drug treatments), the GNN can learn conditional independencies robustly. The expected outcome is a directed graph highlighting causal regulatory relationships, enabling more accurate identification of effective drug targets upstream of disease phenotypes.
