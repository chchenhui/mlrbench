**Title:** Causal Representation Learning for Multi-Omic Target Identification  

**Motivation:** Current ML models in genomics often identify correlative patterns rather than causal mechanisms, leading to poor generalizability and failed drug targets. Addressing this gap is critical to prioritize biologically relevant disease drivers and reduce costly clinical trial failures.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a causal representation learning framework that integrates multi-omic data (e.g., single-cell RNA, proteomics) to infer latent causal factors underlying diseases. The method will combine causal discovery algorithms (e.g., neural network-based directed acyclic graphs) with counterfactual reasoning to disentangle confounders and predict intervention effects. For example, variational autoencoders could map omics data to latent variables, while causal attention mechanisms model gene regulatory networks. The framework will be validated using perturbation data (e.g., CRISPR screens) to ensure biological plausibility. Expected outcomes include interpretable causal pathways linking genetic variants to disease phenotypes and prioritized therapeutic targets. If successful, this could accelerate gene therapy development by identifying high-confidence targets with causal evidence, reducing trial-and-error in drug discovery.
