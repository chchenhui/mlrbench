**Key Challenges:**

1. **High Dimensionality and Data Sparsity**: Biological datasets often contain thousands of variables with limited samples, making causal inference computationally intensive and prone to overfitting.

2. **Integration of Multimodal Data**: Combining diverse omics data (e.g., genomics, proteomics) requires sophisticated models to capture complex interactions and ensure consistency across modalities.

3. **Interpretability of Causal Models**: Ensuring that causal models are interpretable to biologists is crucial for practical applications, yet many advanced models lack transparency.

4. **Efficient Experimental Design**: Designing perturbation experiments that effectively reduce uncertainty in causal graphs is challenging, necessitating active learning strategies to prioritize informative interventions.

5. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Accurately quantifying uncertainty in causal inferences is essential for robust conclusions but remains difficult due to the complexity of biological systems and data variability.
