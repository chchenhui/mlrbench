**VeriMem – A Veracity-Driven Memory Architecture for LLM Agents**

### 2. Introduction  
**Background**  
Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal advisory systems, where accuracy and trustworthiness are paramount. However, persistent challenges like hallucination (generating factually incorrect content) and bias propagation during memory recall undermine their reliability. Existing memory architectures, such as A-MEM (Xu et al., 2025) and CoALA (Sumers et al., 2023), focus on organizing memories for adaptability but lack explicit mechanisms to validate the veracity of stored information. Recent works, including Veracity-Aware Memory Systems (Doe et al., 2024) and Rowen (Ding et al., 2024), highlight the promise of integrating fact-checking and veracity scoring, yet critical gaps remain in balancing adaptability with trustworthiness and minimizing computational overhead.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research proposes *VeriMem*, a novel memory architecture designed to:  
1. **Assign and dynamically update veracity scores** to stored memories using lightweight fact-checking against trusted external corpora.  
2. **Prioritize high-veracity memories during retrieval** while flagging low-confidence recalls for re-validation or replacement.  
3. **Reduce hallucination rates and bias amplification** without compromising the agent’s ability to adapt to new information.  
4. **Integrate seamlessly** into existing LLM agent frameworks like ReAct, ensuring practical applicability.  

**Significance**  
VeriMem addresses key challenges in agent safety outlined in the Workshop on Safe & Trustworthy Agents, particularly in "safe reasoning and memory" and "agent evaluation." By embedding veracity awareness into memory systems, this work advances the trustworthiness of LLM agents in critical applications, mitigates ethical risks, and provides a scalable framework for future research.

### 3. Methodology  
**3.1. VeriMem Architecture**  
VeriMem augments standard memory modules with four components:  
1. **Veracity Scorer**: Assigns initial scores to memories at write time based on source credibility and internal consistency.  
2. **Fact-Checking Module**: Periodically validates stored memories against trusted corpora (e.g., PubMed, Reuters News API) using vector similarity and semantic matching.  
3. **Dynamic Threshold Controller**: Adjusts the veracity score threshold for retrieval based on contextual confidence and task criticality.  
4. **Uncertainty Estimator**: Flags low-confidence recalls, triggering external lookups or human oversight.  

**3.2. Veracity Scoring and Validation**  
- **Initial Scoring**: Each memory entry $m_i$ receives an initial veracity score $v_i^0$ computed as:  
  $$  
  v_i^0 = \alpha \cdot s_{\text{source}} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot s_{\text{consistency}},  
  $$  
  where $s_{\text{source}}$ is the credibility of the input source (e.g., 1.0 for textbooks, 0.7 for user inputs) and $s_{\text{consistency}}$ measures alignment with prior high-veracity memories.  
- **Periodic Validation**: Scores are updated using a decay factor $\gamma$ and fact-checking results:  
  $$  
  v_i^{t+1} = \gamma \cdot v_i^t + (1 - \gamma) \cdot f_{\text{check}}(m_i),  
  $$  
  where $f_{\text{check}}$ returns 1 if the memory matches trusted external data and 0 otherwise.  

**3.3. Retrieval with Dynamic Thresholds**  
During retrieval, memories with $v_i^t > \tau(t)$ are prioritized, where $\tau(t)$ is a threshold adjusted based on task urgency and corpus confidence:  
$$  
\tau(t) = \tau_{\text{base}} + \beta \cdot \sigma\left(\text{confidence}_{\text{corpus}}(t)\right).  
$$  
Here, $\sigma$ is a sigmoid function, and $\beta$ controls sensitivity to corpus reliability. Memories below $\tau(t)$ trigger external lookups or human validation.  

**3.4. Uncertainty Estimation**  
A lightweight ML model (e.g., logistic regression) predicts recall confidence $c_i$ using features like veracity score variance and retrieval frequency. If $c_i < 0.5$, the agent invokes a fact-checking subroutine or seeks human input.  

**3.5. Experimental Design**  
**Datasets**:  
- **Dialogue History**: Custom dataset simulating medical consultations, with annotated hallucinations and biases.  
- **Code Debugging**: HuggingFace’s CodeXGlue benchmark, modified to introduce plausible bugs requiring multi-step memory.  
- **Bias Evaluation**: StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021) for measuring bias amplification.  

**Baselines**:  
1. A-MEM (Xu et al., 2025)  
2. Rowen (Ding et al., 2024)  
3. Standard ReAct (Yao et al., 2022)  

**Metrics**:  
1. **Hallucination Rate**: HARM score (Hallucination Assessment for Relevance and Meaning).  
2. **Bias Amplification**: Normalized StereoSet score.  
3. **Task Performance**: Accuracy (code debugging), BLEU (dialogue).  
4. **Efficiency**: Latency per retrieval, fact-checking API calls/hour.  

**Ablation Studies**:  
- Remove dynamic thresholds.  
- Disable periodic validation.

### 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Reduced Hallucinations**: VeriMem is projected to lower HARM scores by 30–40% compared to A-MEM and Rowen.  
2. **Bias Mitigation**: StereoSet scores will show a 25% reduction in bias propagation.  
3. **Task Performance**: Accuracy in code debugging and BLEU in dialogue tasks will remain stable or improve slightly.  
4. **Efficiency**: Fact-checking latency will stay under 500ms per query via optimized API batching.  

**Impact**  
VeriMem will advance the safety of LLM agents in high-risk domains:  
- **Healthcare**: Reduce diagnostic errors caused by hallucinated patient history recalls.  
- **Finance**: Mitigate biased investment advice stemming from outdated or unreliable market data.  
- **Research Community**: Provide an open-source framework for veracity-aware AI systems, fostering collaboration in agent safety.  

By addressing the Workshop’s focus on "trustworthy memory" and "evaluation for LLM agents," this work will set a foundation for regulatory standards and inspire future innovations in AI safety.
