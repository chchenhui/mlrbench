**Title:** Verifiable Action Attributability Chains for Agent Accountability

**Motivation:** As LLM agents execute complex tasks involving long reasoning chains, memory access, and tool use, attributing their final actions to specific causes becomes critical for trust, debugging, and accountability. Lack of clear traceability hinders our ability to understand failures, audit agent behaviour against safety constraints, and ensure responsible operation.

**Main Idea:** We propose developing "Action Attributability Chains" (AACs), a method to create verifiable logs linking an agent's final action back through its reasoning process, tool interactions, and accessed memory states. This involves instrumenting the agent architecture to record dependencies between intermediate thoughts, API calls, retrieved information, and subsequent steps. The resulting chain would be structured and potentially cryptographically verifiable, allowing auditors or users to precisely trace *why* an action was taken and identify contributing factors, including potentially biased data or faulty reasoning. This enhances interpretability and provides a robust mechanism for accountability in agentic systems.
