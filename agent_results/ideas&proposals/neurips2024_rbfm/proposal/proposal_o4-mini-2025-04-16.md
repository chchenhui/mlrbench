Title  
Knowledge-Guided Contrastive Pre-Training for Responsible and Resource-Efficient Multimodal Generative Models  

1. Introduction  
1.1 Background  
Recent advances in multimodal generative modeling—combining text, image, video, and audio modalities—have driven breakthroughs in robotics, healthcare, and human–computer interaction. Yet large vision-language and multimodal models routinely exhibit two critical shortcomings:  
• Hallucinations and misinformation: models generate plausible but factually incorrect content, risking safety and trust.  
• Harmful or biased outputs: inadvertently learned stereotypes and unsafe content can propagate social harm.  
Moreover, post-hoc mitigation strategies (e.g., fine-tuning, filtering) incur substantial computational and data costs, slowing deployment in resource-constrained settings.  

1.2 Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a **preemptive** pre-training framework that:  
1. Integrates structured factual and ethical knowledge to reduce hallucinations and bias.  
2. Employs contrastive objectives to align multimodal embeddings with verified knowledge representations.  
3. Leverages dynamic dataset curation to prune redundant or harmful samples, thereby cutting compute overhead.  
4. Validates reliability, fairness, and sustainability across standard benchmarks and real-world tasks.  

1.3 Significance  
By embedding responsibility and sustainability directly into pre-training, our work:  
– Breaks the cycle of expensive post-hoc fixes.  
– Sets new design principles for the next generation of multimodal foundational models.  
– Enables safer deployment in critical domains (e.g., medical imaging, assistive robotics) under limited resources.  

2. Methodology  
2.1 Overview of the Framework  
We propose a joint **knowledge-grounded contrastive learning** and **dynamic dataset curation** framework. At each pre-training iteration:  
1. A multimodal batch (image–text pairs) is encoded.  
2. Contrastive losses align cross-modal embeddings with each other and with knowledge-graph embeddings.  
3. An adversarial filter flags harmful or biased samples.  
4. A **Knowledge Consistency Score** (KCS) quantifies alignment; low-KCS samples are pruned, high-KCS samples are reinforced.  

2.2 Data Collection and Preparation  
• Base corpus: large public image–text datasets (e.g., LAION-400M, Conceptual Captions).  
• Knowledge sources: Wikidata triples, domain-specific curated pairs.  
• Preprocessing:  
  – Normalize text, remove offensive tokens.  
  – Map image–text samples to relevant knowledge‐graph entities via entity linking.  

2.3 Model Architecture  
We build on a dual-encoder design:  
• Text encoder $E_T(\cdot)$ (Transformer-based) → embedding $z^t\in\mathbb{R}^d$.  
• Image encoder $E_I(\cdot)$ (ViT-based) → embedding $z^i\in\mathbb{R}^d$.  
• Knowledge encoder $E_K(\cdot)$ (Graph Neural Network) → embedding $g_k\in\mathbb{R}^d$ for each entity $k$.  

2.4 Training Objectives  
Let $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ be a batch of image–text pairs with associated knowledge nodes $k_i$.  

2.4.1 Cross-modal Contrastive Loss  
We adapt the InfoNCE loss to align text and image embeddings:  
$$  
L_{\mathrm{CL}} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \Bigl[\log\frac{\exp(\mathrm{sim}(z_i^t,z_i^i)/\tau)}{\sum_{j=1}^N \exp(\mathrm{sim}(z_i^t,z_j^i)/\tau)} + \log\frac{\exp(\mathrm{sim}(z_i^i,z_i^t)/\tau)}{\sum_{j=1}^N \exp(\mathrm{sim}(z_i^i,z_j^t)/\tau)}\Bigr],  
$$  
where $\mathrm{sim}(u,v)=u^\top v/\|u\|\|v\|$ and $\tau$ is a temperature hyperparameter.  

2.4.2 Knowledge Alignment Loss  
To ground embeddings in factual and ethical knowledge, we minimize:  
$$  
L_{\mathrm{KG}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \bigl\|z_i^t - g_{k_i}\bigr\|_2^2 + \bigl\|z_i^i - g_{k_i}\bigr\|_2^2.  
$$  

2.4.3 Adversarial Filtering Loss  
We train a lightweight discriminator $D(\cdot)$ to predict “harmful” labels. Samples with high adversarial loss are down-weighted:  
$$  
L_{\mathrm{ADV}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \cdot \ell_{\mathrm{CE}}\bigl(D(z_i^t,z_i^i), \,0\bigr),  
$$  
where $w_i = \sigma(-D(z_i^t,z_i^i))$ encourages suppression of harmful samples, and $\ell_{\mathrm{CE}}$ is the cross-entropy.  

2.4.4 Total Loss  
The overall pre-training objective:  
$$  
L = L_{\mathrm{CL}} + \alpha\,L_{\mathrm{KG}} + \beta\,L_{\mathrm{ADV}},  
$$  
where $\alpha,\beta$ balance knowledge grounding and bias mitigation.  

2.5 Dynamic Dataset Curation  
We introduce a **Knowledge Consistency Score** for each sample:  
$$  
\mathrm{KCS}_i = \frac{1}{2}\bigl(\mathrm{sim}(z_i^t,g_{k_i}) + \mathrm{sim}(z_i^i,g_{k_i})\bigr).  
$$  
At fixed intervals:  
1. Rank samples by KCS.  
2. Prune the bottom $p\%$ (those most misaligned or harmful).  
3. Augment the pool with new samples drawn from knowledge-verified image–text pairs.  
This iteratively refines data quality and reduces training size by up to 40%.
