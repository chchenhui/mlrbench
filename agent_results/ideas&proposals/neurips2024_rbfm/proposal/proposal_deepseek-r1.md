# Research Proposal: Knowledge-Guided Multimodal Pre-Training for Reliable and Sustainable Generative Models  

---

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
The rapid advancement of multimodal foundational models, which integrate language, image, video, and audio modalities, has revolutionized applications in robotics, healthcare, and content generation. However, these models often produce *hallucinations* (factually inconsistent outputs) and *harmful content* (biased or unethical generations) due to misalignment with verified knowledge and biased dataset curation. Current solutions, such as post-hoc filters or fine-tuning, are resource-intensive and fail to address root causes. For instance, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 require extensive retraining to mitigate biases, while text-to-image (T2I) models like Stable Diffusion often rely on external classifiers to block unsafe outputs. Proactive integration of reliability and sustainability into pre-training could resolve these challenges at their source while reducing computational costs.  

### Research Objectives  
This research aims to develop a **knowledge-guided multimodal pre-training framework** that:  
1. **Enhances reliability**: Reduces hallucinations and harmful content by aligning cross-modal representations with verified knowledge.  
2. **Improves fairness**: Suppresses biased outputs via adversarial filtering during pre-training.  
3. **Promotes sustainability**: Dynamically curates training data to reduce computational overhead.  
4. **Identifies failure sources**: Diagnoses whether reliability issues stem from data quality, architecture, or pre-training strategies.  

### Significance  
By integrating knowledge graphs and dynamic dataset pruning into pre-training, this work addresses the *reactive gap* in current approaches. It promotes **trustworthy deployment** in safety-critical domains like healthcare and ensures **sustainable AI** by lowering training costs by 30–40%. The proposed framework aligns with the workshop’s goals of responsible model design through proactive knowledge integration and efficient resource utilization.

## 2. Methodology  

### Research Design  
The framework (Fig. 1) consists of three key modules:  
1. **Multimodal Knowledge Encoder**: Aligns representations across modalities using knowledge graphs.  
2. **Knowledge-Guided Contrastive Learning**: Minimizes misalignment between data and verified knowledge.  
3. **Adversarial Filtering and Dynamic Dataset Curation**: Prunes harmful/redundant data to ensure fairness and efficiency.  

#### Data Collection  
- **Multimodal Data**: Publicly available image-text pairs (CC-3M, COCO, HowTo-100M) and video-audio datasets (AudioSet).  
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Structured (Wikidata, ConceptNet) and unstructured (Wikipedia, arXiv) knowledge sources.  
- **Bias and Harmfulness Labels**: Annotated subsets from ToxicPairs and FairFace for adversarial filtering.  

#### Algorithmic Steps  
**Step 1: Multimodal Knowledge Encoding**  
A transformer-based encoder maps inputs (image $x_i$, text $x_t$) and knowledge graph triplets $(h, r, t)$ into a shared embedding space. For a knowledge triplet $(h, r, t)$, the embedding is derived as:  
$$
\mathbf{e}_{hrt} = \text{MLP}(\mathbf{h} \oplus \mathbf{r} \oplus \mathbf{t}),
$$  
where $\oplus$ denotes concatenation.  

**Step 2: Knowledge-Guided Contrastive Learning**  
A contrastive loss aligns image-text pairs with their corresponding knowledge embeddings. Given batch embeddings $\mathbf{V} = \{\mathbf{v}_1, ..., \mathbf{v}_N\}$ (visual) and $\mathbf{T} = \{\mathbf{t}_1, ..., \mathbf{t}_N\}$ (text), the loss adjusts CLIP’s objective with knowledge similarity $s_{kg}$:  
$$
L_{cont} = -\log \frac{\exp(s(\mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{t}_j) + \lambda s_{kg}(\mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{t}_j))}{\sum_{k=1}^N \exp(s(\mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{t}_k) + \lambda s_{kg}(\mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{t}_k))},
$$  
where $s_{kg}(\mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{t}_j)$ computes cosine similarity between $\mathbf{v}_i$ and its nearest knowledge graph embedding.  

**Step 3: Adversarial Filtering**  
A discriminator $D$ identifies harmful samples using a cross-entropy loss:  
$$
L_{adv} = -\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)}[y \log D(x) + (1 - y) \log (1 - D(x))],
$$  
where $y=1$ denotes harmful content. Low-confidence samples are pruned from the training set.  

**Step 4: Dynamic Dataset Curation**  
A **knowledge consistency score** $KCS(x)$ evaluates alignment between generated outputs and verified knowledge:  
$$
KCS(x) = \text{sim}(\mathbf{e}_x, \mathbf{e}_{kg}),
$$  
where $\mathbf{e}_x$ is the output embedding and $\mathbf{e}_{kg}$ is the nearest knowledge graph embedding. Low-scoring samples trigger data pruning and model retraining.  

#### Experimental Design  
- **Baselines**: Compare against CLIP, REVEAL, KM-BART, and post-hoc filtering methods.  
- **Tasks**: Text-to-image generation (COCO), visual question answering (VQAv2), and bias evaluation (StereoSet).  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Reliability**: Hallucination rate (HaluEval), harmful content rate (ToxiGen).  
  - **Fairness**: Bias score (StereoSet), demographic parity.  
  - **Sustainability**: Training FLOPs, energy consumption.  
  - **Knowledge Alignment**: KCS, accuracy on knowledge-intensive tasks.  
- **Ablation Studies**: Isolate contributions of knowledge integration, adversarial filtering, and dynamic pruning.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Expected Outcomes  
1. **Reduced Hallucinations**: Hallucination rates reduced by 25–35% on VQAv2 and text-to-image tasks compared to CLIP and Stable Diffusion.  
2. **Improved Fairness**: Bias scores lowered by 20–40% on StereoSet via adversarial filtering.  
3. **Sustainability Gains**: 30–40% reduction in training FLOPs through dynamic pruning.  
4. **Diagnostic Insights**: Empirical analysis identifying data quality (e.g., noise in CC-3M) as the primary source of reliability issues.  

### Broader Impact  
This framework establishes a blueprint for **proactive, knowledge-driven AI development**, enabling:  
- **Trustworthy Deployment**: Safer generative models for healthcare, education, and robotics.  
- **Sustainable Practices**: Lower resource consumption aligns with green AI initiatives.  
- **Ethical AI Standards**: Addressing biases and misinformation at the source promotes societal well-being.  

By integrating reliability and sustainability into pre-training, this work bridges critical gaps in multimodal foundational models, ensuring their responsible evolution in the AI era.
