   - **Authors**: Julian Perry, Surasakdi Siripong, Thanakorn Phonchai
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces Adaptive Knowledge-Guided Pretraining for Large Vision-Language Models (AKGP-LVLM), a method that dynamically incorporates structured and unstructured knowledge into large vision-language models during pretraining and fine-tuning. The approach employs a knowledge encoder, a retrieval mechanism, and a dynamic adaptor to effectively align multimodal and knowledge representations. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art models, highlighting the model's robustness, efficiency, and scalability.
