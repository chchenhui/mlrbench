**Title:** Proactive Safety Alignment via Curriculum-Based Data Curation for Multimodal Models

**Motivation:** Current multimodal models often exhibit undesirable behaviors like generating harmful content or reflecting societal biases, frequently addressed reactively post-training. This research aims to proactively instill safety and fairness during the pre-training phase itself, reducing the need for costly post-hoc fixes and promoting responsible AI development from the outset.

**Main Idea:** We propose a curriculum learning approach integrated with data curation for pre-training multimodal models. The core idea is to structure the pre-training data progression from "safe" and "simple" to more "complex" and "diverse," while actively filtering or down-weighting potentially problematic data points identified by safety classifiers or bias metrics early on. Initially, the model learns foundational concepts from highly vetted, low-risk multimodal data (e.g., neutral descriptions, common objects). Gradually, more complex and potentially sensitive data is introduced, but only subsets that pass rigorous automated safety and fairness checks. This controlled exposure allows the model to learn robust representations while minimizing the absorption of harmful correlations, making the model inherently safer and fairer with potentially improved resource efficiency by focusing compute on high-quality, aligned data.
