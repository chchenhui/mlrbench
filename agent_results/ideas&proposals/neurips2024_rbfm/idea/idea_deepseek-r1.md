**Title:** Cross-Modal Consistency Regularization for Mitigating Hallucinations and Harmful Content in Multimodal Foundational Models  

**Motivation:** Multimodal models often generate inconsistent ("hallucinated") or harmful content due to misaligned or biased data, raising reliability and safety concerns. Current solutions focus on post-hoc fixes, which are resource-intensive and fail to address root causes. Proactive mitigation during pre-training is critical to reduce downstream risks and improve sustainability.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a training framework that enforces cross-modal consistency to minimize hallucinations and harmful outputs. Leveraging contrastive learning, the model learns to align embeddings across modalities (text, image, audio) while penalizing incoherent or unsafe associations via a multi-objective loss. A lightweight *safety discriminator* module, pre-trained on annotated toxic/hallucinated content, dynamically scores input data and model outputs during pre-training, guiding the model to avoid harmful patterns. Additionally, dataset curation integrates metadata and context-aware filters to preemptively remove biased or misleading multimodal pairs. Outcomes include a resource-efficient training paradigm that reduces harmful generations by design and improves coherence across modalities, validated via adversarial benchmarks (e.g., checking text-image consistency in generated captions/visuals). Impact: Safer, more reliable multimodal systems with reduced need for post-deployment corrections.
