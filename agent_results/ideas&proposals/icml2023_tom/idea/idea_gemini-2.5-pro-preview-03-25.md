**Title:** ToM-Guided Empathetic Dialogue Generation

**Motivation:** Current dialogue systems often lack genuine empathy and fail to adequately infer user emotions, beliefs, or intentions, resulting in superficial or unhelpful interactions. Incorporating Theory of Mind (ToM) principles can enable AI agents to better understand the user's mental state, leading to more supportive and effective communication, particularly in sensitive contexts like mental health support or customer service.

**Main Idea:** This research proposes integrating a ToM module into sequence-to-sequence dialogue models. The ToM module will explicitly infer the user's likely emotional state, beliefs (e.g., "user believes X is difficult"), and intentions based on linguistic cues and dialogue history. This inferred mental state representation will then condition the generation of responses, guiding the model to produce more empathetic, validating, and contextually appropriate replies. We will train and evaluate the model on empathetic dialogue datasets, measuring improvement via automatic metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE tailored for empathy) and human evaluations focusing on perceived empathy and helpfulness.
