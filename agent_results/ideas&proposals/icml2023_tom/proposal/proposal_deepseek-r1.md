**Research Proposal: Meta-Theory: A Meta-Learning Framework for Theory of Mind in Conversational AI**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Modern conversational AI systems often fail to account for users’ latent mental states—such as beliefs, intentions, and knowledge gaps—resulting in generic or contextually misaligned responses. Theory of Mind (ToM), the cognitive ability to infer others’ mental states, is critical for enabling agents to adapt dynamically to individual users. While recent work has explored ToM integration in language models (e.g., SymbolicToM, MindDial), existing approaches lack the ability to rapidly personalize inferences for new users with minimal interaction data. This limitation hinders applications in healthcare, education, and human-AI collaboration, where adaptability and empathy are paramount.  

**Research Objectives**  
1. Develop a meta-learning framework that equips conversational agents with a lightweight ToM module capable of few-shot adaptation to individual users.  
2. Investigate the interplay between ToM inference and dialogue generation through joint optimization.  
3. Establish robust evaluation metrics for ToM-driven personalization, including adaptation speed, task success, and perceived empathy.  

**Significance**  
This work bridges gaps in personalized human-AI interaction by addressing three key challenges:  
- **Scalability**: Meta-learning reduces reliance on extensive user-specific data.  
- **Explainability**: Explicit ToM modeling provides interpretable insights into the agent’s reasoning.  
- **Social Impact**: Improved adaptability enhances trust and efficiency in assistive technologies.

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### **2.1 Data Collection**  
We will generate a synthetic multi-turn dialogue corpus annotated with latent mental states (beliefs, goals, knowledge) using a hybrid approach:  
1. **LLM Generation**: Use GPT-4 to simulate diverse conversational scenarios (e.g., negotiation, tutoring) and generate dialogue trees.  
2. **Annotation**: Automatically label each utterance with ground-truth mental states using rule-based parsers and validated templates (e.g., “User believes X because Y”).  
3. **Human Validation**: Crowdsource corrections via Amazon Mechanical Turk to ensure annotation accuracy.  

The corpus will include 100,000 dialogues across 10 domains, with 20% reserved for testing.  

#### **2.2 ToM Module Pretraining**  
The ToM module is a transformer-based encoder that maps dialogue history $D_t = \{u_1, u_2, ..., u_t\}$ to a mental state vector $m_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$:  
$$m_t = \text{ToM-Encoder}(D_t; \theta_{\text{ToM}})$$  
where $\theta_{\text{ToM}}$ denotes trainable parameters. Pretraining minimizes a cross-entropy loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{ToM}}$ between predicted and ground-truth mental state labels.  

#### **2.3 Meta-Learning with MAML**  
We apply Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to enable few-shot adaptation:  
1. **Inner Loop**: For each user $i$, compute adapted parameters $\theta_{\text{ToM}}'$ using $K$ dialogue examples:  
   $$\theta_{\text{ToM}}' = \theta_{\text{ToM}} - \alpha \nabla_{\theta_{\text{ToM}}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{ToM}}^{(i)}$$  
2. **Outer Loop**: Update $\theta_{\text{ToM}}$ to minimize the average loss across users:  
   $$\theta_{\text{ToM}} \leftarrow \theta_{\text{ToM}} - \beta \nabla_{\theta_{\text{ToM}}} \sum_{i} \mathcal{L}_{\text{ToM}}^{(i)}(\theta_{\text{ToM}}')$$  

#### **2.4 Joint Optimization During Deployment**  
At inference time, the agent generates responses while refining its ToM inferences:  
1. **Mental State Tracking**: Update $m_t$ iteratively using the latest user utterance.  
2. **Response Generation**: A decoder produces responses conditioned on $m_t$ and dialogue history:  
   $$p(y_t | D_t, m_t) = \text{Decoder}(D_t, m_t; \theta_{\text{Dec}})$$  
3. **Adaptation**: Fine-tune $\theta_{\text{ToM}}$ online via gradient descent on $\mathcal{L}_{\text{ToM}}$.  

#### **2.5 Experimental Design**  
**Baselines**:  
- **Static ToM**: Pretrained ToM module without adaptation.  
- **Fine-Tuned ToM**: ToM module fine-tuned per user.  
- **SymbolicToM** [Sclar et al., 2023]: A graph-based ToM tracker.  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
- **Adaptation Speed**: Number of interactions needed to achieve 90% mental state prediction accuracy.  
- **Task Success Rate**: Percentage of dialogues where the agent achieves user-defined goals.  
- **Perceived Empathy**: Likert-scale ratings from live user studies (100 participants across 5 domains).  
- **ToMi Benchmark** [White & Brown, 2023]: Standardized ToM reasoning tasks.  

**User Studies**:  
Participants interact with the agent in scenarios requiring belief updates (e.g., correcting misconceptions). Post-study surveys assess trust and satisfaction.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. A meta-learning framework that enables conversational agents to adapt ToM inferences 50% faster than fine-tuning baselines.  
2. Improved task success rates (15% increase) and empathy scores (20% higher than static ToM) in user studies.  
3. Public release of the synthetic dialogue corpus and codebase to foster community research.  

**Impact**  
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Agents that rapidly align with users’ mental states can enhance educational tutors, healthcare assistants, and customer service bots.  
- **Ethical AI**: Transparent ToM modules mitigate risks of manipulation by making reasoning processes interpretable.  
- **Foundational Research**: The framework provides a blueprint for integrating meta-learning with cognitive modeling.
