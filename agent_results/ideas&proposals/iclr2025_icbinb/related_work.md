1. **Title**: "Underspecification Presents Challenges for Credibility in Modern Machine Learning" (arXiv:2011.03395)
   - **Authors**: Alexander D'Amour, Katherine Heller, Dan Moldovan, et al.
   - **Summary**: This paper identifies underspecification as a key reason for unexpected poor behavior of ML models in real-world domains. It demonstrates that underspecified ML pipelines can produce predictors with equivalent performance in training but varying behaviors in deployment, leading to instability and poor model behavior. The study highlights the need to address underspecification in ML pipelines intended for real-world deployment.

4. **Title**: "Adversarial Attacks Against Medical Deep Learning Systems" (arXiv:1804.05296)
   - **Authors**: Samuel G. Finlayson, Hyung Won Chung, Isaac S. Kohane, Andrew L. Beam
   - **Summary**: This paper demonstrates that adversarial examples can manipulate deep learning systems across three clinical domains. Both white and black box attacks were highly successful against representative medical DL classifiers. The study highlights the unique susceptibility of medical systems to adversarial attacks and urges practitioners to be aware of these vulnerabilities when deploying DL systems in clinical settings.

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Underspecification in ML Pipelines**: ML models often exhibit unexpectedly poor behavior in real-world domains due to underspecification, where multiple predictors with equivalent training performance behave differently in deployment.

2. **Deployment Workflow Issues**: Practitioners face challenges at each stage of the ML deployment process, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and integration into existing systems.

3. **Adversarial Vulnerabilities**: Medical deep learning systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can manipulate model outputs and lead to incorrect diagnoses or treatment recommendations.

4. **Data Distribution Shifts**: Differences between training and deployment environments can cause ML models to underperform due to changes in data distribution.

5. **Integration with Clinical Workflows**: Incorporating ML models into existing clinical workflows presents challenges related to usability, interpretability, and clinician trust.
