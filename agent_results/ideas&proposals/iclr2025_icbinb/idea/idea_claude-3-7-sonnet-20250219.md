# Understanding Deep Learning Failures in Real-World Healthcare Applications

## Motivation
Deep learning models often fail when deployed in healthcare settings despite promising benchmark results. These failures can lead to misdiagnoses, biased treatment recommendations, and waste of healthcare resources. Understanding why deep learning underperforms in clinical environments is critical for developing more reliable AI-assisted healthcare tools and preventing harmful outcomes for patients. The gap between laboratory performance and real-world utility represents a significant barrier to the beneficial integration of AI in medicine.

## Main Idea
I propose a systematic framework to analyze and categorize healthcare-specific deep learning failures through a multi-dimensional assessment approach. The research will collect case studies of failed healthcare AI implementations across radiology, pathology, clinical decision support, and remote monitoring systems. For each case, we'll analyze: (1) dataset shifts between development and deployment environments, (2) performance disparities across demographic subgroups, (3) workflow integration challenges, and (4) model interpretability issues for clinician trust. The methodology includes retrospective analysis of failed deployments, interviews with healthcare providers who experienced these systems, and controlled simulations to reproduce failure conditions. The expected outcome is a taxonomy of healthcare-specific failure modes with corresponding mitigation strategies, ultimately creating a decision support tool for healthcare organizations to evaluate AI readiness and implementation risks.
