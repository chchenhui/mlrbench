1. **Title**: **"X-Cause: Explainability-Driven Root Cause Analysis for Diagnosing Deep Learning Failures in Real-World Deployments"**  

2. **Motivation**: While deep learning (DL) excels in controlled benchmarks, real-world deployments often face suboptimal performance, safety risks, or ethical failures due to unseen data shifts, model limitations, or deployment mismatches. Existing tools lack systematic approaches to attribute failures to their root causes, leaving practitioners to troubleshoot ad hoc. This gap stifles progress, as lessons from failures remain siloed, and theoretical insights into ML weaknesses are underutilized.  

3. **Main Idea**: We propose **X-Cause**, a framework that combines explainable AI (XAI) techniques with structured root-cause analysis (RCA) to dissect real-world DL failures. Our approach involves: (1) Collaborating with domain experts across healthcare, robotics, and fairness to compile a repository of failure case studies; (2) Applying post hoc XAI methods (e.g., SHAP, ICE) to trace errors back to data (e.g., distribution shifts, biases), model (e.g., overfitting, brittleness), and deployment (e.g., hardware constraints); and (3) Validating root causes via counterfactual analysis and ablation studies. The framework produces a taxonomy of failure patterns and provides interpretable diagnostic reports to guide mitigation (e.g., data augmentation, model recalibration). Expected outcomes include a benchmark dataset of annotated failure cases, a software tool for semi-automated RCA, and open-access publication to foster cross-domain collaboration. The potential impact is significant: enabling proactive failure mitigation, enhancing model transparency, and bridging the gap between theory and practice by formalizing lessons from negative results.
