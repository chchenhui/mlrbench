## 1. Title
CoEval – A Collaborative Multi-Stakeholder Framework for Assessing Generative AI’s Societal Impact

## 2. Introduction

### Background
Generative AI systems are transforming various sectors by producing text, images, audio, and video content. While these systems offer immense potential, they also present significant societal implications, including biases, cultural impacts, and environmental costs. The NeurIPS Broader Impact statement has underscored the need for AI publications to consider negative societal impacts. However, there is a critical gap in standardized protocols for assessing these impacts. Current evaluations are often ad hoc, expert-centric, and lack standardized methods for involving diverse stakeholders.

### Research Objectives
The primary objective of this research is to develop a collaborative, multi-stakeholder framework, CoEval, for assessing the broader impacts of generative AI systems. This framework aims to:
1. Bridge the gap between evaluation science and participatory methods.
2. Ensure that developers, end-users, domain experts, and policymakers co-design and conduct impact evaluations.
3. Foster broader community adoption of best practices for assessing generative AI’s societal impact.

### Significance
Creating a standardized and inclusive framework for evaluating generative AI’s societal impacts is crucial for several reasons:
- **Enhanced Accountability**: Involving diverse stakeholders ensures that AI systems are developed and evaluated with a broader perspective, enhancing accountability.
- **Improved Evaluation Quality**: A collaborative framework can lead to more comprehensive and valid evaluations by incorporating diverse expertise and perspectives.
- **Policy Recommendations**: The framework can inform policy decisions by providing standardized, evidence-based evaluations of AI systems.
- **Empowerment and Inclusivity**: By involving underrepresented groups, the framework can empower communities and ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed in a fair and inclusive manner.

## 3. Methodology

### Research Design
CoEval is a three-phase, open-source framework designed to assess generative AI’s societal impacts through collaboration among diverse stakeholders.

#### Phase 1: Co-Design Workshops
**Objective**: To co-create context-specific impact criteria with diverse stakeholders.

**Methodology**:
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Identify key stakeholders, including developers, end-users, domain experts, and policymakers.
- **Facilitation**: Use structured facilitation techniques to guide discussions and ensure all voices are heard.
- **Card-Sorting**: Employ card-sorting methods to prioritize social, ethical, and economic dimensions of AI impact.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Refine criteria through iterative feedback sessions.

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Context-specific impact criteria prioritized by diverse stakeholders.
- Structured facilitation guidelines for future workshops.

#### Phase 2: Mixed-Methods Toolkit
**Objective**: To offer modular tools for conducting impact evaluations.

**Methodology**:
- **Survey Instruments**: Develop modular survey instruments to assess various dimensions of AI impact.
- **Focus-Group Scripts**: Create focus-group scripts to gather qualitative insights.
- **Scenario Simulations**: Design scenario simulations to explore potential AI impacts.
- **Computational Metrics**: Implement lightweight computational metrics, such as bias amplification scores.

**Expected Outcomes**:
- A mixed-methods toolkit for conducting comprehensive impact evaluations.
- Initial pilot data and evaluation results.

#### Phase 3: Living Repository & Policy Templates
**Objective**: To publish evaluation protocols, anonymized pilot data, and model policy briefs.

**Methodology**:
- **Repository Development**: Develop a public platform to host evaluation protocols, pilot data, and policy briefs.
- **Anonymization**: Anonymize pilot data to protect participant privacy.
- **Policy Briefs**: Create model policy briefs based on evaluation findings.

**Expected Outcomes**:
- A living repository of evaluation protocols, pilot data, and policy briefs.
- Community-endorsed policy recommendations.

### Experimental Design
To validate the CoEval framework, we will pilot it across three generative AI domains: text, vision, and audio. The pilot will involve:
- Conducting co-design workshops with stakeholders in each domain.
- Using the mixed-methods toolkit to evaluate AI systems in these domains.
- Publishing evaluation protocols, pilot data, and policy briefs on the public platform.

### Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the effectiveness of the CoEval framework, we will use the following metrics:
- **Participation Rate**: Measure the percentage of stakeholders who actively participate in workshops and evaluations.
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Assess the satisfaction of stakeholders with the evaluation process and outcomes.
- **Evaluation Quality**: Evaluate the comprehensiveness and validity of the impact assessments conducted.
- **Policy Adoption**: Track the adoption of policy recommendations derived from the framework.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Validated Participatory Metrics
By involving diverse stakeholders in the co-design and evaluation process, CoEval will generate validated, participatory metrics that accurately reflect the societal impacts of generative AI systems.

### Open Toolkit
The mixed-methods toolkit developed through CoEval will be an open-source resource available to the AI community, enabling reproducible and transparent impact evaluations.

### Community-Endorsed Policy Recommendations
The framework will produce policy briefs that are grounded in empirical data and endorsed by the community, providing actionable recommendations for policymakers.

### Broader Community Adoption
By demonstrating the benefits of inclusive evaluation practices, CoEval will encourage broader community adoption of best practices for assessing AI’s societal impacts.

### Empowerment and Inclusivity
Involving underrepresented groups in the evaluation process will empower communities and ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed in a fair and inclusive manner.

### Policy and Research Contributions
The CoEval framework will contribute to the policy and research landscape by providing a standardized, inclusive approach to evaluating generative AI’s societal impacts. This will inform future research and policy decisions, advancing the field of AI ethics and governance.

### Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Ensure diverse representation and active participation by using structured facilitation techniques and providing incentives for participation.
- **Data Privacy**: Anonymize pilot data and ensure compliance with data protection regulations to protect participant privacy.
- **Scalability**: Develop a modular and adaptable framework that can be scaled to different AI domains and contexts.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Iteratively refine the framework based on user feedback and emerging best practices in evaluation science.

## Conclusion
CoEval addresses the critical gap in standardized protocols for assessing the broader impacts of generative AI systems. By weaving evaluation science with participatory methods, CoEval empowers developers, end-users, domain experts, and policymakers to co-design and conduct impact evaluations. The expected outcomes include validated participatory metrics, an open toolkit, and community-endorsed policy recommendations, driving inclusive, reproducible, and transparent impact evaluations.
