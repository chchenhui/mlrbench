## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **CoEval: A Collaborative Multi-Stakeholder Framework for Standardizing and Democratizing the Evaluation of Generative AI's Societal Impacts**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, capable of producing novel text, images, audio, and video, are rapidly proliferating across diverse societal domains. Their integration promises significant benefits but also carries profound risks, ranging from reinforcing societal biases and disseminating misinformation to impacting labour markets and cultural norms (Solaiman et al., 2023). Recognizing these potential harms, the AI research community, spurred partly by initiatives like the NeurIPS Broader Impact statement, increasingly acknowledges the need to evaluate the societal consequences of these powerful technologies.

However, current approaches to assessing the broader impacts of generative AI are often fragmented, inconsistent, and predominantly expert-driven. As highlighted by the NeurIPS workshop call "Evaluating Evaluations," there is a critical lack of standardized methodologies and best practices for conducting these assessments. Evaluations are frequently performed *ad hoc*, lack rigorous grounding in measurement science (Chouldechova et al., 2024), and crucially, often fail to incorporate the perspectives of the diverse communities affected by these systems (Mun et al., 2024; Parthasarathy et al., 2024). This "expert-centric" approach risks overlooking context-specific harms, neglecting the values of marginalized groups, and ultimately failing to produce AI systems that are truly aligned with societal well-being. The challenge lies not only in defining *what* impacts to measure (bias, fairness, environmental cost, cultural shifts, etc.) but also *how* to measure them validly and reliably, and *who* should be involved in the evaluation process.

**2.2 Research Problem and Gap**
The core problem addressed by this research is the absence of a standardized, validated, and participatory framework for evaluating the broader societal impacts of generative AI systems. Existing methods suffer from several key limitations identified in the literature and the workshop motivation:
*   **Lack of Standardization:** Evaluations vary significantly in scope, methodology, and metrics, hindering comparability and the accumulation of knowledge (Solaiman et al., 2023; Chouldechova et al., 2024).
*   **Limited Stakeholder Involvement:** Evaluations are often designed and executed solely by AI experts, neglecting the crucial insights and lived experiences of end-users, domain experts, policymakers, and potentially impacted communities (Mun et al., 2024; Parthasarathy et al., 2024). This limits the ecological validity and perceived legitimacy of assessments.
*   **Methodological Silos:** There is a disconnect between technical metrics favoured by AI developers and the qualitative, context-rich assessments needed to understand nuanced societal impacts. Evaluation science principles are not consistently applied (Chouldechova et al., 2024).
*   **Barriers to Adoption:** The complexity, cost, and lack of clear guidance prevent wider adoption of rigorous social impact evaluations by developers and organizations.

This research proposes **CoEval**, a novel framework designed to bridge these gaps by integrating principles of evaluation science, participatory design, and mixed-methods research. CoEval aims to create a systematic, yet flexible, approach that empowers diverse stakeholders to collaboratively define, measure, and interpret the societal impacts of specific generative AI applications within their relevant contexts.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
The primary goal of this research is to develop, validate, and disseminate the CoEval framework. This overarching goal translates into the following specific objectives:

1.  **Develop the CoEval Framework:** Design a structured, three-phase process (Co-Design Workshops, Mixed-Methods Toolkit, Living Repository & Policy Templates) that guides collaborative impact assessment.
2.  **Co-Design Context-Specific Impact Criteria:** Utilize participatory workshops involving diverse stakeholders (developers, users, domain experts, policymakers, affected community representatives) to identify and prioritize relevant societal impact dimensions for generative AI in specific domains (text, vision, audio).
3.  **Develop a Modular Mixed-Methods Toolkit:** Create and refine a collection of adaptable instruments (surveys, focus group protocols, scenario simulations, computational metrics) suitable for assessing the co-designed impact criteria.
4.  **Pilot and Validate the CoEval Framework:** Apply the CoEval framework and toolkit in pilot studies across three distinct generative AI domains (e.g., text generation for news, image generation for creative arts, audio synthesis for accessibility) to assess its feasibility, effectiveness, and the validity of its outputs.
5.  **Establish a Living Repository and Generate Guidelines:** Create an open-source online repository to share CoEval protocols, anonymized pilot data, toolkit modules, and policy brief templates. Distill findings into standardized guidelines for conducting participatory impact assessments of generative AI.
6.  **Promote Community Adoption and Policy Recommendations:** Foster broader community uptake of participatory evaluation practices and develop evidence-based policy recommendations to support sustained investment in inclusive AI impact assessment.

**2.4 Significance**
This research holds significant potential to advance the field of AI evaluation and contribute to the development of more responsible and societally beneficial generative AI. By establishing a standardized yet adaptable participatory framework, CoEval aims to:
*   **Enhance Evaluation Quality:** Improve the validity, reliability, and relevance of impact assessments by grounding them in both measurement science and diverse stakeholder perspectives.
*   **Democratize AI Governance:** Empower a wider range of stakeholders to participate meaningfully in shaping AI development and accountability, moving beyond purely technical or expert-driven assessments (Mun et al., 2024; Parthasarathy et al., 2024).
*   **Establish Community Norms:** Contribute to the NeurIPS community's goal of creating shared standards and best practices for evaluating broader impacts, fostering transparency and reproducibility.
*   **Inform Responsible AI Development:** Provide developers with practical tools and insights to anticipate, identify, and mitigate potential negative societal consequences earlier in the AI lifecycle.
*   **Support Evidence-Based Policy:** Generate actionable insights and policy templates to guide regulatory efforts and funding priorities related to generative AI assessment.

Ultimately, CoEval seeks to shift the paradigm of AI evaluation from a retrospective, often narrow technical exercise to a proactive, inclusive, and continuous process of societal deliberation and co-creation.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Research Design**
This research will employ a mixed-methods, participatory action research (PAR) design, structured across three main phases executed iteratively. The PAR approach emphasizes collaboration with stakeholders throughout the research process, ensuring the framework is relevant, usable, and addresses real-world needs. Iteration will allow for refinement based on feedback and pilot study findings.

**Phase 1: Framework Co-Design and Criteria Elicitation (Months 1-6)**
This phase focuses on convening stakeholders to define the scope of impact assessment for specific contexts and identify relevant criteria.

*   **Stakeholder Identification and Recruitment:** We will identify key stakeholder groups for three pilot domains:
    *   *Domain 1: Text Generation (e.g., news writing assistants)*: AI developers, journalists, editors, media consumers, misinformation experts, ethicists.
    *   *Domain 2: Image Generation (e.g., tools for artists/designers)*: AI developers, graphic designers, artists, stock photo providers, copyright experts, representatives from communities potentially misrepresented.
    *   *Domain 3: Audio Synthesis (e.g., voice cloning for accessibility/entertainment)*: AI developers, voice actors, accessibility advocates, individuals with speech impairments, ethicists, fraud prevention experts.
    Recruitment will use purposive and snowball sampling, partnering with industry associations, community organizations, and academic networks to ensure diversity across expertise, demographics, and perspectives. We aim for 15-20 participants per domain workshop series. Ethical approval will be obtained, and participants will provide informed consent and be compensated for their time.
*   **Co-Design Workshops:** A series of facilitated workshops (likely 2-3 per domain) will be conducted.
    *   *Methods:* We will use structured techniques like **Value Sensitive Design (VSD)** principles, **Threat Modeling**, and **Card Sorting** (similar to Bodker's technique but focused on impact dimensions). Participants will collaboratively brainstorm potential impacts (positive and negative) across social, ethical, economic, environmental, and cultural dimensions, drawing inspiration from frameworks like Solaiman et al. (2023). Card sorting will help group related impacts and prioritize key evaluation criteria based on perceived severity, likelihood, and importance to stakeholders. Facilitation will ensure equitable participation.
    *   *Outputs:* For each domain, a prioritized list of context-specific societal impact criteria (e.g., "Accuracy and Bias in News Summaries," "Fair Representation in Generated Images," "Potential for Malicious Use of Cloned Voices") and initial ideas for how these might be measured.

**Phase 2: Mixed-Methods Toolkit Development and Pilot Testing (Months 4-18)**
This phase involves creating measurement tools based on Phase 1 outputs and testing them in pilot evaluations. This phase overlaps with Phase 1 as initial toolkit development can begin based on existing literature.

*   **Toolkit Component Development:** Based on the co-designed criteria, we will develop a modular toolkit comprising:
    *   *Survey Instruments:* Validated scales (where available) and newly developed questionnaires to measure stakeholder perceptions, attitudes, and reported experiences related to specific impacts (e.g., perceived fairness, trust, job displacement anxiety). We will draw on principles from survey methodology and measurement theory (Chouldechova et al., 2024).
    *   *Focus Group & Interview Scripts:* Semi-structured protocols to elicit qualitative insights into nuanced impacts, user experiences, and unintended consequences. Protocols will guide discussions around the prioritized criteria.
    *   *Scenario-Based Assessments:* vignettes or interactive simulations presenting realistic use cases of the generative AI system. Stakeholders will react to these scenarios, allowing assessment of potential behaviours, ethical judgments, and downstream consequences in controlled settings.
    *   *Computational Metrics:* Lightweight, interpretable metrics for assessing specific technical aspects related to societal impact, where feasible. Examples include:
        *   *Bias Metrics:* Adapting measures like the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) for text or measuring demographic parity differences in image generation quality/representation (e.g., difference in image quality scores for different demographic prompts). Quantifying disparate error rates for different user groups using audio tools. A potential bias amplification score $B_{amp}$ could be defined as the ratio of bias in the model output to bias in the training data, $B_{amp} = \frac{\text{Bias}(Output)}{\text{Bias}(Input)}$, using a suitable bias measure.
        *   *Robustness Metrics:* Assessing output degradation or harmful content generation under adversarial or out-of-distribution prompts.
        *   *Privacy Metrics:* Simple checks for regurgitation of training data or potential for identity inference (where applicable).
    *   *Qualitative Coding Frameworks:* Taxonomies and guidelines for systematically analyzing qualitative data from focus groups, interviews, and open-ended survey responses, aligned with the co-designed impact criteria.
*   **Pilot Studies:** We will conduct pilot evaluations using the CoEval framework and toolkit within the three selected domains.
    *   *Setup:* Partner with developers or utilize open-source models representing each domain (e.g., a fine-tuned LLM for news, Stable Diffusion for images, a TTS model for audio). Recruit a diverse group of evaluators (~30-50 per pilot, including representatives from the initial stakeholder groups).
    *   *Process:* Evaluators will interact with the AI system and then utilize relevant modules from the CoEval toolkit (e.g., complete surveys, participate in focus groups, assess outputs using computational metrics where appropriate). Data will be collected via online platforms, recorded sessions (with consent), and system logs.
    *   *Iteration:* Feedback on the clarity, usability, and relevance of the toolkit modules and the overall CoEval process will be collected from pilot participants. The toolkit and framework guidelines will be iteratively refined based on this feedback and analysis of the pilot data. For example, if a survey question proves ambiguous, it will be rephrased; if a computational metric doesn't correlate with perceived harm, its utility will be reassessed.

**Phase 3: Repository Creation, Guideline Distillation, and Dissemination (Months 15-24)**
This phase focuses on consolidating learnings and making the CoEval framework accessible.

*   **Living Repository Development:** An open-source, web-based platform will be created.
    *   *Content:* It will house the CoEval framework documentation, finalized toolkit modules (instruments, scripts, code snippets for metrics), standardized protocols for conducting evaluations, anonymized (aggregated) data from the pilot studies (subject to ethical constraints), templates for reporting findings, and model policy briefs.
    *   *Functionality:* Designed for easy navigation and contribution, potentially hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages or a dedicated website. A mechanism for community feedback and contribution will be integrated.
*   **Guideline Synthesis:** Findings from the co-design workshops and pilot studies across the three domains will be synthesized to distill a set of standardized, yet adaptable, guidelines for conducting participatory societal impact assessments of generative AI. These guidelines will incorporate principles from evaluation science (Chouldechova et al., 2024) and participatory methods (Parthasarathy et al., 2024; Mun et al., 2024). The guidelines will cover stakeholder identification, criteria selection, toolkit usage, data analysis, and ethical considerations.
*   **Dissemination:** Findings, the framework, guidelines, and repository will be disseminated through:
    *   Academic publications (conferences like NeurIPS, FAccT, CHI; relevant journals).
    *   Presentations at workshops (including the "Evaluating Evaluations" workshop) and industry events.
    *   Blog posts, tutorials, and documentation accompanying the repository.
    *   Direct engagement with AI development teams, policymakers, and civil society organizations.

**3.2 Data Collection and Analysis**
*   **Qualitative Data:** Workshop transcripts, focus group recordings, interview notes, open-ended survey responses, scenario reactions. Analysis will involve thematic analysis using coding frameworks derived from the co-designed criteria. Software like NVivo or Dedoose will be used. Inter-coder reliability will be established.
*   **Quantitative Data:** Survey responses (Likert scales, multiple-choice), card sorting rankings, computational metric scores, scenario choice data. Analysis will involve descriptive statistics (means, frequencies, distributions), inferential statistics (t-tests, ANOVAs, correlations where appropriate to compare groups or conditions), and potentially psychometric analysis (reliability, validity) for newly developed survey scales. Software like R or Python (with libraries like pandas, scipy, statsmodels) will be used.
*   **Mixed-Methods Integration:** Quantitative and qualitative findings will be triangulated to provide a comprehensive understanding of impacts. For example, survey results indicating perceived bias might be explained by qualitative insights from focus groups about specific experiences.

**3.3 Validation and Evaluation of the CoEval Framework**
The effectiveness of the CoEval framework itself will be evaluated throughout the process using metrics such as:
*   **Feasibility:** Time and resources required to implement the framework in pilot studies.
*   **Usability:** Stakeholder ratings of the clarity, ease of use, and usefulness of the workshops, toolkit modules, and guidelines (e.g., using standard usability scales like SUS).
*   **Effectiveness:** Quality and relevance of the impact criteria generated; ability of the toolkit to measure these criteria reliably; demonstrable insights gained from the pilot evaluations compared to hypothetical non-participatory approaches.
*   **Inclusivity:** Diversity of participants engaged; self-reported sense of empowerment and voice among stakeholders, especially those from underrepresented groups.
*   **Adoption Potential:** Interest expressed by external teams/organizations in using the framework or repository.
