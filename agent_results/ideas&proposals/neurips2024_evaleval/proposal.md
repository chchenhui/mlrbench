Title:  
CoEval: A Collaborative Multi-Stakeholder Framework for Standardized Evaluation of Generative AI’s Broader Societal Impacts

1. Introduction  
Background  
Generative AI systems—from large language models to image and audio generators—are reshaping how we create content, communicate, and make decisions. Their rapid adoption in fields as diverse as journalism, art, education, and customer service underscores both their promise and the risks they pose. In response, venues such as NeurIPS have introduced “Broader Impact” statements to prompt authors to reflect on societal consequences. Yet, these statements remain largely ad hoc and expert-centric. No community-driven, standardized protocol exists for systematically measuring the social, ethical, economic, and environmental impacts of generative AI.  

Recent work highlights this gap. Solaiman et al. (2023) offer seven social-impact categories across modalities, but without a participatory design component. Chouldechova et al. (2024) ground impact measurement in social-science measurement theory yet remain expert-focused. Particip-AI (Mun et al. 2024) and Parthasarathy et al. (2024) stress the value of participatory methods but do not pair them with a living toolkit or open repository. Bridging these literatures, we propose CoEval, an open-source, three-phase framework that weaves participatory methods, standardized measurement theory, and community governance into a coherent process for evaluating generative AI’s broader impacts.  

Research Objectives  
1. Define and validate a participatory co-design process that engages developers, end users, domain experts, and policymakers in jointly specifying impact criteria.  
2. Develop a modular, mixed-methods evaluation toolkit incorporating surveys, focus-group scripts, scenario simulations, and quantitative metrics grounded in measurement theory.  
3. Pilot and iteratively refine the framework across three generative domains (text, vision, audio), culminating in an openly accessible repository of protocols, pilot data, and policy templates.  

Significance  
By democratizing the evaluation process, CoEval will ensure that underrepresented voices help shape AI accountability. Standardizing protocols will enhance reproducibility and comparability across studies, while the living repository will facilitate community-driven evolution of best practices. Ultimately, CoEval aims to transform “Broader Impact” from a statement into a rigorous, inclusive, and transparent evaluation practice, informing both research norms and policy.  

2. Methodology  
Overview  
CoEval unfolds in three interlocking phases:  
• Phase I – Co-Design of Impact Criteria  
• Phase II – Toolkit Development and Formalization  
• Phase III – Pilots, Iteration, and Community Rollout  

Phase I: Stakeholder Mapping & Co-Design Workshops  
1. Stakeholder Identification  
   • Map relevant actors using a two-axis typology: expertise (technical ↔ non-technical) and role (developer ↔ impacted community).  
   • Target 8–12 participants per workshop representing AI researchers, domain experts (e.g., healthcare, journalism), policymakers, ethicists, community advocates, and regular end-users.  

2. Structured Co-Design  
   • Facilitation employs card-sorting: each card describes a potential impact dimension (bias amplification, privacy risk, labor displacement, environmental cost, mental-health effects, misinformation).  
   • Participants assign weights $w_i$ to each dimension $d_i$, subject to $\sum_i w_i = 1$.  
   • Prioritization emerges via iterative Delphi rounds until convergence ($|w_i^{(t+1)} - w_i^{(t)}| < \epsilon$ for all $i$, $\epsilon = .01$).  

3. Deliverables  
   • A stakeholder-endorsed Impact Criteria Matrix $C\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$, where $n$ is the number of domains (text, vision, audio) and $m$ the agreed dimensions.  

Phase II: Mixed-Methods Toolkit & Measurement Theory Integration  
1. Survey Instruments  
   • Develop Likert-scale items for each dimension $d_i$, ensuring content validity via expert review and cognitive pre-testing.  
   • Compute internal consistency (Cronbach’s $\alpha$):  
     $$\alpha = \frac{k}{k-1}\Bigl(1 - \frac{\sum_{j=1}^k \sigma^2_{Y_j}}{\sigma^2_X}\Bigr)$$  
     where $k$ is the number of items, $\sigma^2_{Y_j}$ the variance of item $j$, and $\sigma^2_X$ the variance of the total score.  

2. Focus-Group Protocols  
   • Semi-structured scripts aligned to the Impact Criteria Matrix.  
   • Use thematic analysis to extract qualitative insights, coding transcripts with Cohen’s $\kappa$ to assess inter-rater reliability:  
     $$\kappa = \frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e}$$  
     where $p_o$ is observed agreement and $p_e$ chance agreement.  

3. Scenario Simulations  
   • Construct domain-specific vignettes illustrating plausible use cases and harms.  
   • Collect participant responses on harm salience, which yield scenario-based harm scores $H_{ij}$ (stakeholder $i$, scenario $j$). Aggregate via weighted sum:  
     $$H_j = \sum_i w_i\,H_{ij}.$$  

4. Computational Metrics  
   • Implement bias amplification score for text models (as in Solaiman et al.):  
     $$\mathrm{BiasAmp} = P_{\text{model}}(y|x) - P_{\text{data}}(y|x).$$  
   • Environmental cost metric: estimate CO$_2$ emissions per inference using established profiling tools.  
   • Privacy leakage estimate: extend membership-inference risk formulas to generative contexts.  

5. Formalization & Documentation  
   • Translate all instruments into machine-readable JSON schemas.  
   • Embed measurement-theory best practices (systematization, operationalization, validation) from Chouldechova et al.  

Phase III: Pilot Deployment, Iteration & Community Repository  
1. Pilot Domains & Systems  
   • Text: GPT-3/GPT-4 style model on open-source benchmarks.  
   • Vision: Diffusion-based image generator (e.g., Stable Diffusion).  
   • Audio: WaveNet-style speech synthesizer.  

2. Experimental Design  
   • Between-group study: Group A applies CoEval; Group B applies a baseline expert-only protocol.  
   • Metrics of Success:  
     – Comprehensiveness: number of unique harms identified per domain.  
     – Stakeholder Satisfaction: averaged Likert scores on usability and perceived legitimacy.  
     – Reliability: Cronbach’s $\alpha>0.7$, Cohen’s $\kappa>0.6$.  
     – Time to completion and resource cost.  

3. Statistical Analysis  
   • Use two-sample $t$-tests or Mann–Whitney $U$ tests to compare Group A vs B on continuous metrics.  
   • Apply ANOVA to examine domain × method interactions:  
     $$Y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + (\alpha\beta)_{ij} + \epsilon_{ijk}$$  
     where $\alpha_i$ is the domain effect, $\beta_j$ the method effect, and $\epsilon_{ijk}\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$.  

4. Iterative Refinement  
   • After each pilot, reconvene a mixed stakeholder panel to review quantitative results and qualitative feedback.  
   • Update the Impact Criteria Matrix, survey items, scripts, and computational metrics accordingly.  

5. Living Repository & Policy Templates  
   • Launch a GitHub-based platform containing:  
     – Finalized protocols (JSON, PDF).  
     – Anonymized pilot datasets and analysis scripts.  
     – Draft policy briefs tailored to funders, research labs, and regulators.  
   • Enable community pull requests and issue‐tracking to evolve CoEval over time.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Validated Participatory Metrics  
We will produce a set of stakeholder-endorsed measurement instruments with demonstrated reliability (Cronbach’s $\alpha\ge0.8$, Cohen’s $\kappa\ge0.7$) and validity (content, construct, criterion) across text, vision, and audio domains.  

Open-Source Toolkit  
The mixed-methods toolkit—comprising surveys, focus-group guides, scenario scripts, and modular code for computational metrics—will be released under an OSI-approved license. Researchers and practitioners can adapt modules to new domains or languages, ensuring broad applicability.  

Community-Endorsed Policy Recommendations  
Drawing on pilot data and stakeholder deliberations, we will distill policy templates that outline best practices for funding agencies, corporate research labs, and governmental bodies. These recommendations will address investment priorities for social-impact evaluation, requirements for public reporting of broader impacts, and guidelines for multi-stakeholder governance.  

Standardized Evaluation Framework  
By openly hosting and curating CoEval, we anticipate widespread adoption as the de facto standard for generative AI impact assessment. Integration with publication venues (e.g., NeurIPS, ACL) and funding guidelines (e.g., NSF Broader Impacts) will further institutionalize participatory evaluation.  

Societal & Ethical Benefits  
CoEval’s inclusive design ensures that evaluations capture diverse perspectives—particularly those of marginalized communities often excluded from AI governance. This participatory accountability mechanism will surface harms that purely expert-driven methods overlook, fostering AI systems more closely aligned with societal values.  

4. Conclusion  
CoEval addresses a critical need: a standardized, participatory framework for measuring the broader impacts of generative AI. By uniting evaluation science, community engagement, and open-source tooling, our proposal transforms broader-impact assessment from a rhetorical exercise into a rigorous, inclusive, and evolving practice. The resulting framework will empower researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and communities to co-create AI technologies that advance innovation while upholding social and ethical responsibilities.
