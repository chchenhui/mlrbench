**Title:** Co-Design Toolkit for Participatory Generative AI Impact Assessment

**Motivation:** Evaluating the broader impacts of Generative AI requires diverse stakeholder perspectives, yet practical methods for incorporating non-expert input into technical evaluations are lacking, hindering comprehensive risk assessment and responsible development.

**Main Idea:** Develop and validate a "Co-Design Toolkit" â€“ a set of structured methods and accessible digital tools facilitating collaboration between AI developers and diverse community stakeholders (e.g., artists, educators, ethicists, affected group representatives) to define context-specific impact metrics and evaluation protocols. The toolkit would guide participants through modules for impact scenario mapping, value elicitation, risk identification, metric brainstorming, and qualitative data collection tailored for non-technical users. We will pilot the toolkit on specific Generative AI applications (e.g., educational chatbots, synthetic media tools), involving relevant stakeholder groups. Expected outcomes include a validated, adaptable methodology for participatory evaluation, richer impact assessments reflecting lived experiences, and improved AI system design informed by broader community values.
