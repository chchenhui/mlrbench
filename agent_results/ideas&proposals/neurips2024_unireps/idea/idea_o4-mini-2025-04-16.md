Title: Meta-Contrastive Representational Alignment (MCRA)

Motivation:  
Different neural models often learn overlapping features from the same data distribution, yet their internal representations remain misaligned, hindering model merging, transfer, and joint interpretation. MCRA seeks to uncover and enforce these shared invariances, enabling seamless stitching of heterogeneous architectures and offering insights into the core abstractions that emerge during learning.

Main Idea:  
MCRA introduces a two-stage pipeline. First, given a batch of inputs, we simultaneously extract hidden activations from two or more pretrained models (e.g., ResNet and ViT, or BERT and GPT). These activations are projected into a unified embedding space via lightweight, learnable mapping networks. Second, we optimize this projection using a contrastive loss: matching representations of the same input across models are pulled together, while those from different inputs are pushed apart. To regularize, we incorporate a sparsity penalty that highlights only universally salient features.  
Expected outcomes include: (1) quantitatively higher alignment scores (CKA, SVCCA), (2) improved performance in model‚Äêstitching tasks without fine-tuning, and (3) identification of cross-model invariant subspaces. This framework paves the way for unified multi-model systems and deeper understanding of emergent neural abstractions.
