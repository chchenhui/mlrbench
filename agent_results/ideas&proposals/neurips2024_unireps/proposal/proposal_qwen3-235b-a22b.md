# Task-Conditioned Functional Alignment for Cross-Architecture Model Merging

## Introduction

### Background
Neural models across both biological and artificial systems exhibit emergent similarities in representation structures when exposed to shared stimuli. In machine learning, this phenomenon has direct practical implications: aligned representations enable efficient model merging, reusability, and multi-modal fusion. However, current methods struggle with architectural heterogeneity (e.g., CNNs vs. Transformers) and task distribution shifts, often requiring full fine-tuning or parameter-space projection that negates computational savings. The growing interest in functional alignment—mapping *activation spaces* rather than weight spaces—offers a promising path to address these limitations.

### Research Objectives
This research proposes Task-Conditioned Functional Alignment (TCFA), a framework to:
1. Identify **functional alignment conditions** that enable stable mapping between disparate architectures.
2. Develop **task-conditioned alignment mechanisms** using input-driven activation manifolds.
3. Construct **parameter-efficient stitching operators** that generalize across architectures.
4. Empirically validate TCFA on vision and language tasks with heterogeneous model families.

### Significance
By bridging theoretical alignment principles in neuroscience (e.g., Canonical Representation Hypothesis) with practical model merging constraints, this work addresses two critical gaps:
- **Scientific**: Understanding how task-specific invariances govern representation alignment across architectures.
- **Engineering**: Enabling computationally efficient deployment of composite models without sacrificing performance.

TCFA directly tackles architectural disparities (Challenge 1) and generalization concerns (Challenge 5) identified in the literature through its activation-space focus and task-conditioned design.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection & Model Inventory
We curate pre-trained model pairs (Table 1) on ImageNet-1K and GLUE benchmarks:

| Domain      | Architecture A     | Architecture B      | Training Objective        |
|-------------|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Vision      | ResNet-50          | Vision Transformer   | Image classification      |
| NLP         | BERT               | Gated CNN            | Masked language modeling  |
| Multi-modal | CLIP (ViT-B/16)    | Flamingo-400M        | Image-text alignment      |

#### Functional Probing Protocol
For each model pair, we perform **task-conditioned activation extraction**:
1. Sample inputs under structured task conditions:
   - **Classification**: Class-stratified samples
   - **Translation**: Complexity-binned sequences
   - **Image tasks**: Augmented transformations (rotations, jitter)
2. Record activation matrices $A^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times D}$ at layer $l$ for batch size $B$ and dimensionality $D$.
3. Apply task-conditioned filtering $ \mathcal{F}_c $ to isolate activation subspaces:
   $$ \hat{A}^{(l)}_c = \text{Normalize}\left(\mathcal{F}_c\left(A^{(l)}\right)\right) \quad \forall c\in\mathcal{C} $$

### 2. Functional Alignment Framework
We develop two alignment strategies:

#### 2.1 Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT)
For task condition $c \in \mathcal{C}$, compute transport plan $T$ minimizing:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{T} &\ \langle T, C \rangle_F + \epsilon H(T) \\
\text{s.t.} &\ T\mathbf{1} = \mu,\ T^T\mathbf{1} = \nu \\
C_{ij} &= \|x^{(c)}_i - y^{(c)}_j\|^2 \quad \forall x,y \in \hat{A}^{(l)}_c
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\epsilon$ controls entropy regularization. The transport plan defines a projection layer $ \mathcal{P}_c $ mapping between activation manifolds.

#### 2.2 Conditional Canonical Correlation Alignment (CCCA)
Maximize task-specific correlation between activations:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\max_{\mathbf{W}_X,\mathbf{W}_Y} &\ \text{Corr}\left(\mathbf{W}_X^T\hat{A}^{(l)}_c, \mathbf{W}_Y^T\hat{B}^{(l)}_c\right) \\
\text{s.t.} &\ \mathbf{W}_X^T\mathbf{W}_X = \mathbf{I},\ \mathbf{W}_Y^T\mathbf{W}_Y = \mathbf{I}
\end{aligned}
$$
This produces orthogonal transformation matrices $\mathbf{W}_X,\mathbf{W}_Y$ that define stitching operations.

### 3. Lightweight Stitching Architecture
For each task condition $c$, the alignment operator is compressed into a lightweight layer:
- HOT: $\mathcal{P}_c$ is approximated by a low-rank matrix $\tilde{M}_c \in \mathbb{R}^{D_X \times D_Y}$
- CCCA: $\tilde{M}_{c} = \mathbf{W}^{\dagger}_X\mathbf{W}_Y$ 

These are combined with conditional routing:
$$
h_{\text{merged}} = \sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \underbrace{\phi(\mathbf{x}; \tilde{M}_c)}_{\text{Stitching layer}} \cdot \mathbf{W}_c^{\text{gating}}\mathbf{h}_{\text{inputs}}
$$
where routing weights $\mathbf{W}_c^{\text{gating}}$ are learned for each condition.

### 4. Experimental Design
#### Baselines
- **Parameter-Space**: Model merging via parameter averaging (e.g., TiesMerging)
- **Activation-Space**: CCA-based alignment without task conditions
- **Architecture-Specific**: CrossAttention insertion for CNN-to-Trans. conversion

#### Evaluation Metrics
| Aspect                | Metric                           | Details                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Performance           | Task-specific ΔAccuracy          | vs. strongest individual model |
| Efficiency            | ΔTrainable Parameters ($\Delta\theta$) | Lower is better              |
| Generality            | Zero-shot Accuracy on Domain-Specific Tasks | ImageNet variants, Diagnostics |
| Alignment Quality     | Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA)   | Between input and output manifolds |

#### Ablation Studies
1. **Alignment Granularity**: Effect of condition $c$ (class-level vs. broad task category)
2. **Architectural Gap**: CNN→Transformer vs. same-arch Merging
3. **Training Dynamics**: Full fine-tuning vs. stitching-only vs. hybrid

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Quantitative Expectations
- **10-15% Accuracy Gain**: Over parameter-space baselines (e.g., TiesMerging) on cross-arch vision tasks.
- **>100× Parameter Efficiency**: Compared to CrossAttention insertion through CNN→Transformer conversion.
- **>0.8 CKA**: Between source and stitched representations under shared task conditions.

### Theoretical Contributions
1. **Conditioned Alignment Theory**: Formalization of task-conditioned functional alignment via manifold transport.
2. **Architectural Generalization Framework**: Quantified bounds on alignment feasibility across model families.
3. **Empirical Laws**: Relationship between architectural disparity and required stitching complexity.

### Practical Impact
1. **Efficient Model Reuse**: Enable low-cost composition of diverse foundation models without retraining.
2. **Cross-Domain Applications**: Improved multimodal fusion in scenarios like medical imaging + text analysis.
3. **Neuroscience Interfaces**: Inform theoretical models of biological-computational system interoperability.

> **Interdisciplinary Bridge**: Our formulation connects the Canonical Representation Hypothesis (CRH) with computational feasibility through functional constraints. By explicitly conditioning on task properties, we address the "You Are What You Eat" critique regarding data-driven structural bias by isolating task-essential representations.

## Conclusion
This proposal introduces TCFA as a novel framework for cross-architecture model merging through task-conditional functional alignment. By systematically addressing challenges in architectural disparity (Challenge 1), task distribution variation (Challenge 2), and computational efficiency (Challenge 4), our approach advances both representation learning theory and practical model reuse. The methodology combines insights from recent alignment research (SARA, CRH) with scalable machine learning techniques, positioning this work at the intersection of theoretical and applied model merging research.
