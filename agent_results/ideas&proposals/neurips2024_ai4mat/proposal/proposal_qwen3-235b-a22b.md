# **Physics-Constrained Multimodal Transformer for Sparse Materials Data**

## **1. Introduction**

### **Background**  
Materials discovery is a cornerstone of technological innovation, driving advancements in energy storage, electronics, and sustainable manufacturing. However, traditional methods rely heavily on trial-and-error experimentation, leading to slow progress. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning, has shown promise in accelerating discovery by enabling predictive modeling of material properties, generative design, and optimization. Despite these advances, AI in materials science has yet to achieve the exponential growth seen in fields like drug discovery or computational biology. Two key challenges impede progress: (1) the sparsity and multimodality of experimental datasets and (2) the integration of known physical laws to ensure scientifically valid predictions.

Materials data is inherently heterogeneous, encompassing synthesis parameters, microscopy images, diffraction patterns, and spectroscopic measurements. Such data is often fragmented, collected under varying conditions, and subject to missing modalities due to experimental limitations. Existing machine learning (ML) models struggle to fuse these disparate sources effectively, especially when physical relationships between modalities are only partially understood. This results in unreliable predictions and limited generalization to unseen data. Furthermore, the lack of physics-informed constraints in ML pipelines often produces solutions that violate fundamental principles (e.g., phase stability, conservation laws), undermining practical utility.

### **Research Objectives**  
This project proposes a **Physics-Constrained Multimodal Transformer** (PC-MMT), a novel architecture designed to address the unique challenges of materials data. Our objectives are as follows:  
1. **Multimodal Fusion**: Develop a Transformer-based framework capable of integrating heterogeneous data types (e.g., text, images, spectra, and numerical features) while robustly handling missing modalities.  
2. **Physics Integration**: Embed known physical laws (e.g., phase diagram compatibility, crystallographic rules) into the model architecture and loss function to enforce plausibility.  
3. **Sparse Data Handling**: Improve generalization and uncertainty quantification on sparse datasets by leveraging domain-informed inductive biases.  
4. **Interpretable Predictions**: Generate predictions with transparent explanations for materials properties, enabling hypothesis-driven experimental validation.  

### **Significance**  
By bridging the gap between ML and materials science, PC-MMT will enable:  
- **Accelerated Discovery**: Reduced reliance on costly experiments by prioritizing promising candidates.  
- **Robustness to Data Limitations**: Effective learning from incomplete datasets, common in emerging materials systems.  
- **Scientific Rigor**: Predictions aligned with physical principles, increasing trust in AI-generated hypotheses.  
- **Interdisciplinary Impact**: A blueprint for integrating domain knowledge into ML models across scientific disciplines.  

This work directly addresses the themes of the AI4Mat workshop, particularly the challenge of translating AI advances to materials science and managing multimodal, incomplete datasets.

## **2. Methodology**

### **2.1 Architecture Design**  
The PC-MMT architecture combines Transformer-based multimodal fusion with physics-informed constraints. Key components include:  

#### **2.1.1 Modality-Specific Tokenization**  
Each input modality (e.g., synthesis parameters, electron microscopy images, X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra) is encoded into a sequence of tokens:  
- **Textual Data** (e.g., synthesis steps): Tokenized using Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and embedded via a learnable lookup table.  
- **Images**: Patchified and encoded using a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract hierarchical features.  
- **Spectra/XRD**: Converted into fixed-length vectors via Fourier transforms or wavelet decompositions.  
- **Numerical Features** (e.g., temperature, pressure): Normalized and projected into the embedding space using a linear layer.  

Formally, for modality $ m \in \{1, \dots, M\} $, the tokenization process maps raw input $ \mathbf{x}^{(m)} $ to token sequences $ \mathbf{Z}^{(m)} \in \mathbb{R}^{L_m \times d} $, where $ L_m $ is the sequence length and $ d $ the embedding dimension.

#### **2.1.2 Cross-Attention for Multimodal Fusion**  
To handle missing modalities, we employ a **modality-aware cross-attention** mechanism. Let $ \mathcal{M} \subseteq \{1, \dots, M\} $ denote the observed modalities. For each pair $ (m, n) \in \mathcal{M} $, we compute cross-attention scores:  

$$
\mathbf{A}^{(m,n)} = \text{Softmax}\left( \frac{ \mathbf{Q}^{(m)} (\mathbf{K}^{(n)})^\top }{ \sqrt{d_k} } \right) \circ \mathbf{M}^{(m,n)}
$$

Here, $ \mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K} $ are learnable query/key matrices, $ d_k $ is the scaling factor, and $ \mathbf{M}^{(m,n)} \in \{0,1\}^{L_m \times L_n} $ is a mask indicating valid token pairs. If modality $ n $ is missing for a sample, its mask entries are zeroed out, effectively skipping cross-attention from $ m $ to $ n $.  

#### **2.1.3 Physics-Informed Layers**  
We introduce two strategies to enforce physical constraints:  
1. **Soft Constraints via Loss Regularization**:  
   Known physical laws (e.g., Gibbs free energy minimization for stability) are encoded as differentiable loss terms. For property prediction, the total loss is:  

   $$
   \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^P w_i \mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}^{(i)}
   $$

   where $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} $ is task-specific (e.g., mean squared error for regression), $ P $ is the number of constraints (e.g., phase stability, charge neutrality), $ w_i $ balances constraint weights, and $ \lambda $ is a hyperparameter. For example, a phase diagram compatibility constraint could penalize predicted compounds violating stoichiometric rules:  

   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}^{\text{phase}} = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \sum_{j=1}^J \max(0, f_j(\mathbf{x})) \right],
   $$

   where $ f_j(\cdot) $ evaluates $ j $-th physical rule violation.  

2. **Hard Constraints via Embedding Projection**:  
   Domain-specific projection layers (e.g., symmetry-preserving operations for crystallography) are embedded into the architecture to restrict latent representations to physically valid manifolds.

### **2.2 Data Collection and Preparation**  
We will curate a dataset combining:  
1. **Experimental Data**: From public repositories like Materials Project and Citrination, including synthesis parameters, structure files (CIF), and measured properties (e.g., bandgap, formation energy).  
2. **Synthetic Data**: Generated using density functional theory (DFT) simulations and generative models to augment sparse regions.  
3. **Imaging/Spectroscopy Data**: Electron microscopy images and XRD spectra from facilities like the National Synchrotron Light Source.  

**Data Augmentation for Sparsity**:  
- Introduce controlled missingness (5–50%) in modalities (e.g., dropping XRD spectra) to simulate real-world imperfections.  
- Apply Gaussian noise and adversarial perturbations to test robustness.

### **2.3 Experimental Design**  
#### **2.3.1 Baselines**  
Compare PC-MMT against:  
- **Meta-Transformer**: A state-of-the-art multimodal framework (Zhang et al., 2023).  
- **MatAgent**: A generative LLM for materials discovery (Takahara et al., 2025).  
- **Graph Neural Networks** (e.g., SchNet, GNNs with crystal graph inputs).  

#### **2.3.2 Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Task Performance**:  
  - **Regression**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Pearson correlation coefficient.  
  - **Classification**: Area Under the Curve (AUC), F1 score.  
- **Physics Plausibility**: Constraint violation counts (e.g., number of predicted unstable compounds).  
- **Robustness**: Accuracy under increasing modal missingness (0% to 50%).  
- **Interpretability**: SHAP values for feature importance and attention heatmaps for cross-modality interactions.  

#### **2.3.3 Ablation Studies**  
- **Component-wise Evaluation**: Study impacts of (1) tokenization strategies, (2) cross-attention mechanisms, and (3) physics constraints.  
- **Transfer Learning**: Assess generalization to unseen material classes (e.g., predicting 2D materials from bulk training data).  

#### **2.3.4 Computational Infrastructure**  
Leverage PyTorch and JAX for parallelized training on multi-GPU clusters. Implement hyperparameter tuning via Bayesian optimization using Optuna.
