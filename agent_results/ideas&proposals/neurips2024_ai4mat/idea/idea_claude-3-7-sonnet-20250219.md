# Multimodal Knowledge Graphs for Incomplete Materials Data Integration

## Motivation
Materials discovery faces a critical bottleneck: heterogeneous data from diverse experimental setups and characterization techniques remain fragmented and incomplete. Unlike fields like computational biology where standardized data formats facilitate AI progress, materials science struggles with disconnected information islands. This hinders the creation of comprehensive datasets needed for AI-driven breakthroughs. The bottleneck is particularly acute when attempting to represent multi-scale phenomena (atomic to macro) alongside incomplete physical understanding of material properties and behaviors.

## Main Idea
This research proposes a specialized knowledge graph framework to integrate multimodal materials data while explicitly representing uncertainty and incompleteness. The approach includes: (1) Development of a materials-specific ontology that accommodates diverse characterization methods and multi-scale phenomena; (2) Integration of physics-informed graph neural networks that can reason over incomplete data while respecting physical constraints; and (3) Implementation of active learning mechanisms that identify the most informative experiments to conduct next, maximizing knowledge gain from limited resources. The framework will automatically flag inconsistencies between experimental results and theoretical predictions, highlighting opportunities for scientific discovery. This system would serve as a unifying platform for the materials community, breaking down data silos while preserving the richness and complexity of materials information, ultimately accelerating the materials discovery process through better data integration.
