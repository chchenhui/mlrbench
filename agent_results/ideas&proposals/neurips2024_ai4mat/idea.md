**Title:** Physics-Constrained Multimodal Transformer for Sparse Materials Data

**Motivation:** Materials science data is inherently multimodal (e.g., synthesis parameters, microscopy images, diffraction patterns) and often sparse or incomplete. Standard machine learning models struggle to fuse this heterogeneous information effectively, especially when underlying physical relationships are only partially known, limiting reliable property prediction and discovery potential.

**Main Idea:** We propose a Transformer-based architecture tailored for multimodal materials data. The model will use modality-specific tokenization and embedding strategies. Cross-attention mechanisms will be designed to handle missing modalities gracefully during fusion. Crucially, we will incorporate known physical laws or domain constraints (e.g., phase diagram compatibility, conservation laws, crystallographic rules) as soft constraints within the learning objective or by designing specific physically-informed attention layers. This integration aims to guide the model towards physically plausible representations and predictions, even with limited data. Expected outcomes include improved generalization, better handling of missing data, and more physically interpretable predictions, thereby accelerating materials discovery by generating more reliable hypotheses from fragmented datasets.
