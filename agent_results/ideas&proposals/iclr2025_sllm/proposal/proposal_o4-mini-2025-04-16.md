1. Title  
Dynamic Mixed-Precision Quantization for Hardware-Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Inference  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Large Language Models (LLMs) built with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers have demonstrated spectacular scaling in both compute efficiency and performance by activating only a small subset of experts per token. However, even sparsely-activated MoEs carry an enormous parameter footprint, leading to memory bottlenecks, high energy consumption, and prohibitive latency when serving on modern hardware—especially in resource-constrained settings. Traditional uniform quantization (e.g., fixed 8-bit or 4-bit for all weights) fails to exploit the fact that experts within the same MoE layer are used with highly varying frequencies and contributions. This one-size-fits-all approach either leaves accuracy on the table (when bit-widths are too low) or miss out on maximal compression (when bit-widths are too high).

Research Objectives  
We propose a Dynamic Mixed-Precision Quantization (DMPQ) framework that:  
• assigns each expert its own bit-width based on activation frequency and importance;  
• learns these assignments via a lightweight reinforcement-learning (RL) policy trained in a hardware-in-the-loop fashion;  
• co-designs the MoE weights and the quantization policy during training to ensure robustness under dynamic precision shifts.  

Our core research questions are:  
1. How can we jointly optimize expert-wise bit-widths to balance model accuracy, inference latency, and energy consumption?  
2. Can a reinforcement-learning agent efficiently explore the combinatorial space of bit-width assignments for tens or hundreds of experts?  
3. What cost-model abstractions best capture hardware latency/energy for rapidly evaluating quantization configurations without full deployment?  

Significance  
By tailoring precision per expert, we expect 2–3× speedup and ∼40% memory reduction over static 8-bit/4-bit quantization baselines, with under 1% accuracy loss on language modeling and downstream tasks. This work will:  
• enable cost-sensitive deployment of large MoEs on edge or low-cost cloud instances;  
• reduce carbon footprint by cutting energy per inference;  
• provide a unifying sparsity-aware quantization framework that can be grafted onto existing MoE architectures.  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Framework Overview  
We consider an L-layer transformer with MoE blocks at selected feedforward layers. Let E be the number of experts in each MoE. For a given input token x, a gating network routes x to a small subset \mathcal{S}(x)\subset\{1,…,E\}. Each selected expert i computes  
y_i = E_i\bigl(Q(W_i;b_i)\bigr)\,x + b_i^{\mathrm{ff}}  
where Q(W_i;b_i) denotes quantization of expert i’s weights W_i to bit-width b_i, and b_i^{\mathrm{ff}} its bias. The final MoE output is y=\sum_{i\in\mathcal{S}(x)} g_i(x)\,y_i.  

Our goal is to learn the bit-width vector \mathbf{b}=(b_1,…,b_E)\in\mathcal{B}^E, where \mathcal{B} might be \{2,4,6,8\}, so as to optimize a multi-objective trade-off. We formulate this as an RL problem:  
• State s encodes per-expert statistics (activation frequency f_i, average gradient magnitude \|\nabla W_i\|, historical accuracy deltas).  
• Action a selects new bit-widths \mathbf{b}.  
• Reward r measures accuracy retention minus latency and energy penalties.  

3.2 Quantization and Expert-wise Precision  
We adopt a uniform affine quantization per expert. For expert i, weight quantization is:  
$$ Q(w_{ij};b_i) = \mathrm{round}\!\bigl(w_{ij}/\Delta_i\bigr)\,\Delta_i,\quad \Delta_i=\frac{\max_j w_{ij}-\min_j w_{ij}}{2^{b_i}-1}\,. $$  
Activation quantization follows similarly. Experts with high f_i are given larger b_i to preserve fidelity; low-frequency experts can be aggressively compressed.  

3.3 REINFORCE-style Policy Optimization  
We parameterize a policy π_\theta(a|s) that outputs a distribution over \mathcal{B}^E. Given s_t, we sample a_t (bit-width assignment) and apply Q(·;b_i) during a forward pass on batch X_t. We compute:  
• Task accuracy metric A(a_t) (e.g., negative perplexity).  
• Measured latency L(a_t) and energy consumption E(a_t) via a fast cost model (or direct hardware probe).  

We define the reward:  
$$ r_t = \alpha\,\bigl[A(a_t)-A_{\mathrm{ref}}\bigr] \;-\;\beta\,\bigl[L(a_t)-L_{\mathrm{ref}}\bigr] \;-\;\gamma\,\bigl[E(a_t)-E_{\mathrm{ref}}\bigr], $$  
where the “ref” subscripts denote reference values under 8-bit static quantization. We train π_\theta to maximize \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[r] via PPO or A2C.  

3.4 Co-training Weights and Policy  
Quantization impacts model gradients; to maintain stability we interleave:  
1. **Policy Update**: Freeze weights W, update θ using collected trajectories {(s_t,a_t,r_t)}.  
2. **Weight Fine-Tuning**: Freeze θ, fix bit-widths to \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[a|s], and fine-tune W under the quantized forward pass for several epochs.  

Pseudocode:  
```
Initialize W₀ (pretrained MoE weights), θ₀  
for iteration=1…N do  
  # Policy Optimization  
  collect trajectories by:  
    for t=1…T do  
      s_t ← extract_stats(W_{t−1})  
      a_t ∼ π_θ(a|s_t)  
      compute forward-pass with Q(W_{t−1};a_t) on batch X_t  
      measure A_t, L_t, E_t, compute r_t  
    end  
  update θ via PPO to maximize ∑_t r_t  
  # Weight Fine-tuning  
  set b_i = E_{a∼π_θ}[a_i|s] for each expert  
  fine-tune W on training data with Q(W;b) for K epochs  
end  
```

3.5 Hardware-in-the-Loop Cost Modeling  
Precise reward evaluation requires latency and energy estimates. We adopt a hybrid approach:  
• A calibrated analytical cost model per bit-width on target accelerators (e.g., A100 GPU, ARM Cortex, FPGA) that predicts L and E within ≤5% error.  
• Periodic direct measurements every M iterations using microbenchmarks loaded onto real hardware.

4.4 Risk Mitigation & Future Directions  
– If direct hardware-in-the-loop is too slow, we will refine analytical models or adopt multi-task surrogate modeling.  
– Should policy convergence stall, we will explore hierarchical RL (first assign groups of experts, then refine).  
– Future extensions include integration with sparse activation pruning and low-rank adapters to further compress MoEs.  

In sum, this proposal bridges state-of-the-art sparsity research (MoE, pruning, quantization) with practical hardware co-design, delivering a unified, adaptive framework that pushes the frontier of efficient, scalable LLM inference.
