# Dynamic Mixed-Precision Quantization for Efficient MoE Inference with Hardware-Aware Optimization

## 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, leading to their widespread adoption in both research and commercial applications. However, the computational demands of these models, particularly during inference, raise significant concerns about their accessibility, environmental impact, and practical deployment. As models continue to grow in size and complexity, the need for efficient inference solutions becomes increasingly critical.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach to address the scalability challenges of LLMs. By activating only a subset of parameters (experts) for each input token, MoE models can achieve impressive parameter efficiency compared to dense models of similar capacity. Major language models such as GLaM, Switch Transformers, and more recently Mixtral have demonstrated that MoE architectures can maintain strong performance while significantly reducing computational requirements during both training and inference.

Despite these advantages, MoE models still face substantial deployment challenges. Their large parameter counts create memory bottlenecks, while the dynamic nature of expert selection introduces latency issues during inference. These limitations are particularly problematic for deployment on resource-constrained hardware or in cost-sensitive environments. Traditional quantization techniques, which apply uniform precision across all model parameters, fail to capitalize on the inherent sparsity and activation variability within MoE architectures, resulting in suboptimal efficiency-performance trade-offs.

This research proposes a novel dynamic mixed-precision quantization framework specifically designed for MoE models. Unlike conventional approaches that apply uniform bit-widths across the model, our framework quantizes each expert to variable bit-widths based on their activation frequency, importance, and contribution to model outputs. Rarely activated experts are more aggressively quantized (e.g., to 2-bit or 4-bit precision), minimizing memory usage, while critical experts retain higher precision (e.g., 8-bit) to preserve accuracy on important computations.

The novelty of our approach lies in the integration of reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize the quantization policy based on hardware characteristics and inference requirements. By treating bit-width selection as a sequential decision-making problem, our system learns to balance task performance, inference speed, and energy consumption. Furthermore, we co-design the MoE architecture and quantization scheme during training to ensure the model develops robustness to precision shifts, eliminating the need for extensive post-training calibration.

This research addresses several key challenges in efficient LLM deployment, particularly at the intersection of MoE architectures, quantization techniques, and hardware-aware optimization. The resulting framework is expected to enable 2-3x faster inference and 40% lower memory usage compared to static quantization approaches, with minimal accuracy degradation (<1%). These advancements will facilitate the deployment of large MoE models on edge devices and cost-sensitive cloud platforms, broadening access to powerful language models while reducing their environmental impact.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed methodology integrates novel techniques across multiple dimensions: expert-specific quantization, reinforcement learning for bit-width optimization, and hardware-aware training. The framework consists of four main components, described in detail below.

### 2.1 Expert Importance Analysis

We begin by developing a systematic approach to quantify the importance of each expert in an MoE model, which will inform our mixed-precision quantization strategy. For a Mixture-of-Experts layer with $N$ experts, we define the following metrics:

1. **Activation Frequency ($AF_i$)**: The proportion of input tokens that activate expert $i$ across a representative dataset $D$:

$$AF_i = \frac{1}{|D| \cdot T} \sum_{d \in D} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \mathbb{1}[i \in \text{top-}k(g(x_{d,t}))]$$

where $T$ is the sequence length, $g(x_{d,t})$ is the gating network output for token $t$ in sample $d$, and $\mathbb{1}[\cdot]$ is the indicator function. The top-$k$ function selects the $k$ highest-scoring experts according to the gating network.

2. **Contribution Magnitude ($CM_i$)**: The average magnitude of each expert's output contribution:

$$CM_i = \frac{1}{|D| \cdot T} \sum_{d \in D} \sum_{t=1}^{T} g_i(x_{d,t}) \cdot \|E_i(x_{d,t})\|_2$$

where $g_i(x_{d,t})$ is the gating weight for expert $i$ and $E_i(x_{d,t})$ is the output of expert $i$ for the given input.

3. **Sensitivity to Quantization ($SQ_i$)**: The performance degradation when expert $i$ is quantized to a low precision (e.g., 4-bit) while keeping other experts at higher precision:

$$SQ_i = \frac{L(M_{all-fp16}) - L(M_{i-4bit})}{L(M_{all-fp16})}$$

where $L(M)$ is the loss on a validation set using model $M$, $M_{all-fp16}$ is the model with all experts in FP16 precision, and $M_{i-4bit}$ is the model with only expert $i$ quantized to 4-bit.

We combine these metrics into a composite Expert Importance Score ($EIS_i$):

$$EIS_i = \alpha \cdot AF_i + \beta \cdot CM_i + \gamma \cdot SQ_i$$

where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are hyperparameters that control the relative importance of each factor. These scores serve as the foundation for our dynamic quantization strategy.

### 2.2 Mixed-Precision Quantization Framework

Building on the expert importance analysis, we develop a mixed-precision quantization framework that assigns different bit-widths to each expert based on their importance scores. We consider a set of possible bit-widths $B = \{2, 3, 4, 8, 16\}$ for weight quantization.

For each expert $i$, we apply the following quantization procedure:

1. **Weight Quantization**: For an expert with weights $W_i$, the quantized weights $\hat{W}_i$ at bit-width $b$ are computed as:

$$\hat{W}_i = s_i \cdot \text{clamp}(\lfloor \frac{W_i}{s_i} \rceil, -2^{b-1}, 2^{b-1}-1)$$

where $s_i$ is a scaling factor determined by:

$$s_i = \frac{2 \cdot \max(|W_i|)}{2^b - 1}$$

and $\lfloor \cdot \rceil$ denotes rounding to the nearest integer.

2. **Block-wise Quantization**: To account for varying weight distributions within each expert, we divide the weight matrices into blocks of size $m \times n$ and quantize each block independently:

$$\hat{W}_{i,j} = s_{i,j} \cdot \text{clamp}(\lfloor \frac{W_{i,j}}{s_{i,j}} \rceil, -2^{b-1}, 2^{b-1}-1)$$

where $W_{i,j}$ represents the $j$-th block of weights in expert $i$, and $s_{i,j}$ is the block-specific scaling factor.

3. **Activation Quantization**: For inference efficiency, we also quantize the activations using a similar approach, but with a global scaling factor per expert:

$$\hat{A}_i = s_A \cdot \text{clamp}(\lfloor \frac{A_i}{s_A} \rceil, 0, 2^{b_A}-1)$$

where $A_i$ represents the activations for expert $i$, $b_A$ is the activation bit-width (typically 8), and $s_A$ is a scaling factor calibrated on a representative dataset.

### 2.3 Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Bit-Width Selection

We formulate the problem of selecting optimal bit-widths for each expert as a reinforcement learning (RL) task. This approach allows for dynamic adaptation based on hardware constraints and accuracy requirements.

**State Space**: The state $s_t$ at time step $t$ represents the current configuration of the system, including:
- Current bit-width assignments for all experts
- Hardware utilization metrics (memory usage, computation time)
- Task performance metrics (perplexity, accuracy)
- Expert importance scores

**Action Space**: The action $a_t$ involves selecting a new bit-width for one or more experts from the set $B$.

**Reward Function**: We define a reward function that balances multiple objectives:

$$R(s_t, a_t) = \lambda_1 \cdot \text{AccuracyScore} + \lambda_2 \cdot \text{SpeedupScore} + \lambda_3 \cdot \text{MemoryScore}$$

where:
- $\text{AccuracyScore} = \exp(-\kappa \cdot |\text{Acc}_{baseline} - \text{Acc}_{current}|)$ measures the proximity to the baseline accuracy
- $\text{SpeedupScore} = \frac{\text{Time}_{baseline}}{\text{Time}_{current}}$ measures the inference speedup
- $\text{MemoryScore} = \frac{\text{Memory}_{baseline}}{\text{Memory}_{current}}$ measures the memory reduction
- $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, and $\lambda_3$ are hyperparameters controlling the trade-off between objectives

**Policy Network**: We train a policy network $\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)$ using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn the optimal bit-width selection strategy:

$$\theta_{t+1} = \argmax_\theta \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta}[R(s_t, a_t)]$$

subject to constraints on the KL divergence between consecutive policies to ensure stable learning.

The policy network is a small transformer-based model that processes the state information and outputs a probability distribution over possible bit-width configurations. This network is trained through hardware-in-the-loop optimization, directly measuring inference performance on the target hardware platform.

### 2.4 Quantization-Aware Training with Expert Specialization

To ensure robustness to mixed-precision quantization, we incorporate quantization awareness during the training or fine-tuning of MoE models. Our approach involves:

1. **Simulated Quantization**: We introduce simulated quantization during training, applying the quantization and dequantization operations in the forward pass while using full-precision weights during the backward pass:

$$\tilde{W}_i = \text{SQ}(W_i, b_i) = \text{Dequantize}(\text{Quantize}(W_i, b_i))$$

2. **Expert Specialization**: We encourage experts to specialize in different aspects of the task through a modified routing loss:

$$\mathcal{L}_{route} = \alpha \cdot \mathcal{L}_{load} + \beta \cdot \mathcal{L}_{imbalance}$$

where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{load} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |AF_i - \frac{1}{N}|$ penalizes uneven expert utilization
- $\mathcal{L}_{imbalance} = \text{Var}(AF_1, AF_2, ..., AF_N)$ encourages diversity in activation patterns

3. **Precision-Conditioned Training**: We condition experts to function effectively at their target bit-widths by gradually reducing precision during training:

$$b_i(t) = \max(b_{i,target}, b_{i,init} - \delta \cdot t)$$

where $t$ is the training step, $b_{i,init}$ is the initial bit-width (e.g., 16), $b_{i,target}$ is the target bit-width, and $\delta$ controls the rate of precision reduction.

The overall training objective combines the task-specific loss with the routing loss:

$$\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{task} + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{route}$$

where $\lambda$ balances the importance of expert specialization relative to the primary task.

### 2.5 Experimental Design and Evaluation

We will also analyze the relationship between expert importance scores and assigned bit-widths to validate our importance metrics.
