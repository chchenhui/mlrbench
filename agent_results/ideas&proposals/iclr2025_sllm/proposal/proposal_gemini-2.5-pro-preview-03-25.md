**1. Title:** Dynamic Mixed-Precision Quantization for Hardware-Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Inference

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a vast spectrum of natural language processing tasks, driving significant advancements in AI [8, 9]. However, their success comes at the cost of immense computational and memory requirements, particularly during inference. This poses substantial challenges for deployment, especially on resource-constrained hardware environments like edge devices or mobile platforms, and raises concerns regarding energy consumption and environmental sustainability.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach to scale LLMs efficiently [6, 8, 7]. By utilizing sparse computation pathways – activating only a small subset of "expert" sub-networks for each input token – MoEs can achieve performance comparable to much larger dense models but with significantly reduced computational Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) during inference. Despite the reduction in FLOPs, MoE models often possess an extremely large number of parameters distributed across numerous experts. This large parameter count still leads to significant memory footprint bottlenecks, high memory access costs, and substantial latency, hindering their practical deployment.

Quantization, the process of reducing the numerical precision of model parameters and/or activations (e.g., from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit or 4-bit integers), is a widely adopted technique for compressing models and accelerating inference [1, 2, 4]. By lowering the memory requirements and enabling faster computation on specialized hardware, quantization can alleviate the bottlenecks associated with large models. However, traditional quantization methods typically apply a uniform bit-width across the entire model or large sections of it. This static approach may be suboptimal for MoE models, which exhibit unique characteristics:
*   **Dynamic Activation:** Different experts are activated based on the input token, leading to highly variable usage patterns.
*   **Expert Heterogeneity:** Experts can specialize in different functions or data distributions, potentially varying significantly in their importance and sensitivity to quantization noise.

Existing research has explored quantizing MoE models [1, 2, 3, 4], demonstrating the feasibility of applying low-bit precision. MoQE [4] showed that MoE experts are surprisingly robust to weight-only quantization down to 2-bits. MiLo [1] proposed low-rank compensators to recover accuracy for aggressively quantized MoEs, while MC-MoE [2] used linear programming for adaptive bit-width allocation in a training-free manner. MoQa [3] focused on data-model distribution awareness for fine-grained mixed-precision strategies. While these methods advance MoE quantization, they often rely on post-training quantization, heuristics for bit allocation, or lack direct integration with hardware performance feedback during the optimization process. The inherent dynamic nature of MoE activation suggests that a more adaptive, hardware-aware quantization strategy could yield further significant benefits.

**2.2 Problem Statement**
The static, uniform-precision quantization approaches prevalent today fail to fully exploit the inherent sparsity and dynamic, heterogeneous nature of expert utilization within MoE models. Applying aggressive quantization uniformly can lead to significant accuracy degradation for critical, frequently used experts, while allocating excessive precision to rarely activated or less important experts wastes memory and computational resources. There is a need for a dynamic quantization framework specifically designed for MoEs that can adaptively assign precision levels to individual experts based on their runtime characteristics and importance, while explicitly optimizing for hardware efficiency (latency, energy) alongside model accuracy.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
This research aims to develop and evaluate a novel **Dynamic Mixed-Precision Quantization (DMPQ)** framework for MoE models to optimize inference efficiency on hardware. The primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Dynamic Bit-Width Allocation Strategy:** Design a mechanism to assign variable bit-widths (e.g., 2-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit) to different experts within an MoE model based on metrics reflecting their usage frequency, contribution to model performance, and quantization sensitivity.
2.  **Implement a Hardware-Aware Optimization Policy:** Utilize a lightweight Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to learn an optimal bit-width configuration policy. This policy will explicitly balance the trade-offs between model accuracy, inference latency, memory footprint, and energy consumption, incorporating feedback directly from hardware performance models or measurements (hardware-in-the-loop).
3.  **Integrate Quantization into Model Training/Fine-tuning:** Develop a co-design methodology where the MoE model is trained or fine-tuned with awareness of the target mixed-precision quantization scheme. This aims to enhance the model's robustness to varying precision levels assigned by the dynamic policy. Techniques like Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) adapted for the dynamic mixed-precision setting will be explored.
4.  **Evaluate Performance and Efficiency:** Rigorously evaluate the proposed DMPQ framework against state-of-the-art static and mixed-precision quantization baselines on standard LLM benchmarks. The evaluation will focus on accuracy (e.g., perplexity, task-specific metrics), inference speedup (latency, throughput), memory reduction, and estimated energy savings on target hardware platforms (e.g., GPUs, CPUs).

**2.4 Significance**
This research holds significant potential for advancing the efficient deployment of large-scale AI models. By bridging the gap between sparse MoE architectures, adaptive quantization techniques, and hardware performance optimization, this work can:

*   **Enable Scalable MoE Deployment:** Significantly reduce the memory and computational barriers for deploying powerful MoE models on resource-constrained environments like edge devices and mobile phones, democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities.
*   **Reduce Operational Costs:** Lower the inference costs (energy consumption, hardware requirements) for cloud-based MoE deployments, making large model serving more economically viable and environmentally sustainable.
*   **Advance Quantization Research:** Introduce a novel dynamic, hardware-aware quantization paradigm specifically tailored for the unique characteristics of sparse architectures like MoEs, potentially inspiring similar approaches for other dynamic neural network models.
*   **Contribute to Sparsity Understanding:** Provide deeper insights into the interplay between parameter sparsity (implicit in MoE quantization levels) and activation sparsity (inherent in MoE routing), contributing to the broader goals outlined in the workshop theme of exploring sparsity as a unifying framework.
*   **Inform Hardware Co-Design:** The findings could inform the design of future hardware accelerators optimized for sparse, mixed-precision computations prevalent in quantized MoE models.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework**
The proposed Dynamic Mixed-Precision Quantization (DMPQ) framework operates by assigning different quantization bit-widths to the parameters of individual experts within an MoE model. The core idea is to allocate lower precision (e.g., 2 or 4 bits) to experts identified as less critical or less frequently activated, thereby maximizing memory and computational savings, while retaining higher precision (e.g., 8 bits or even 16-bit floating point) for crucial experts to preserve model accuracy. The optimal bit-width configuration is determined by an RL agent trained to optimize a hardware-aware objective function.

**3.2 Data Collection and Models**
*   **Models:** We will utilize pre-trained large MoE models as our primary testbeds. Candidates include open-source models like Mixtral [from Mistral AI, though not explicitly listed in the refs, it's a standard MoE model] or OLMoE [6], if available and suitable. Alternatively, we may apply sparse upcycling techniques [5] to convert pre-trained dense models (e.g., Llama, GPT variants) into MoE architectures to serve as base models. Base models will typically use FP16 or BF16 precision.
*   **Datasets:** For training the RL policy and for final evaluation, we will use standard datasets relevant to the base LLM's capabilities. This includes:
    *   Language Modeling: Datasets like C4 (Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus), WikiText-103, or Penn Treebank for measuring perplexity.
    *   Downstream Tasks: Benchmark suites like GLUE, SuperGLUE, or specific tasks like machine translation (WMT, leveraging NLLB insights [9]) or question answering (SQuAD) to assess performance on diverse applications. A representative subset of the training or a dedicated validation set will be used during the RL training phase. Calibration data, if needed, will be sampled from the training distribution.

**3.3 Dynamic Quantization Algorithm**

**3.3.1 Expert Importance and Sensitivity Profiling:**
Before or during the RL training, we need metrics to guide the bit-width allocation. We will profile experts based on:
*   **Activation Frequency ($f_e$):** The average probability or frequency with which expert $e$ is selected by the MoE gating network over a representative dataset.
*   **Contribution Score ($c_e$):** A measure of the expert's impact on the model's output or loss. This could be estimated using gradient information (e.g., average magnitude of gradients flowing through the expert), influence functions, or sensitivity analysis (measuring accuracy drop when the expert is perturbed or quantized).
*   **Quantization Sensitivity ($s_e$):** Empirically measure the degradation in model performance (e.g., increase in perplexity or task-specific loss) when expert $e$ is quantized to different low bit-widths individually.

These metrics can be combined into an initial heuristic importance score $I_e = g(f_e, c_e, s_e)$ to potentially initialize or guide theRL policy, but the RL agent will ultimately learn the optimal mapping.

**3.3.2 Mixed-Precision Quantization Scheme:**
We will employ standard quantization techniques, primarily affine quantization (also known as asymmetric uniform quantization) for weights. For an expert $e$'s weight tensor $W_e$, its quantized representation $W_{e,q}$ using $b_e$ bits is computed as:
$$ W_{e,q} = \text{clamp}(\text{round}(W_e / S_e + Z_e), 0, 2^{b_e}-1) $$
where $S_e$ is the scaling factor and $Z_e$ is the zero-point, determined per-tensor or per-channel for expert $e$. The de-quantized weights used in computation are $\hat{W}_e = S_e (W_{e,q} - Z_e)$.
The set of available bit-widths for each expert will typically be $B = \{b_{low}, ..., b_{high}\}$, e.g., $B = \{2, 4, 8\}$ bits. FP16/BF16 might be included as the highest precision option.

**3.3.3 Reinforcement Learning Policy for Bit-Width Allocation:**
We formulate the task of finding the optimal per-expert bit-width configuration as a sequential decision-making problem solvable with RL.

*   **State Space ($S$):** The state $s_t$ could include:
    *   Current bit-width assignments for all experts $\{b_e\}_{e=1}^N$.
    *   Profiling statistics for experts (activation frequency $f_e$, contribution $c_e$, sensitivity $s_e$).
    *   Global model performance metrics (e.g., current accuracy/loss on a validation set).
    *   Global hardware performance metrics (e.g., estimated latency $L$, memory usage $M$, energy $E$ based on the current configuration).
    *   Potentially, resource constraints (e.g., target memory budget, max latency).

*   **Action Space ($A$):** The action $a_t$ involves selecting an expert (or a group of experts) and adjusting its assigned bit-width $b_e$ upwards or downwards within the available set $B$. Simpler formulations might involve directly outputting the full N-dimensional vector of bit-widths.

*   **Policy Network ($\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)$):** A lightweight neural network (e.g., a small MLP or RNN) parameterized by $\theta$, which learns to map states to actions (or action probabilities).

*   **Reward Function ($R_t$):** The core of the hardware-aware optimization. The reward signal guides the RL agent towards configurations that balance accuracy and efficiency. A possible formulation is:
    $$ R_t = w_{acc} \cdot \Delta Acc(s_t) - w_{lat} \cdot L(s_t) - w_{mem} \cdot M(s_t) - w_{eng} \cdot E(s_t) $$
    Where:
    *   $\Delta Acc(s_t)$ is the change in accuracy (or negative change in loss) compared to a baseline (e.g., full precision or previous state). Careful calibration is needed here to avoid rewarding trivial solutions.
    *   $L(s_t)$, $M(s_t)$, $E(s_t)$ are the estimated latency, memory footprint, and energy consumption for the configuration defined by $s_t$. These are obtained via:
        *   **Hardware Performance Models:** Analytical models predicting latency/energy based on bit-widths, model architecture, and target hardware specs (e.g., memory bandwidth, compute throughput for different precisions).
        *   **Hardware Simulators:** More detailed cycle-accurate simulators for target hardware (if available).
        *   **Direct Measurement (Hardware-in-the-Loop):** Periodically running inference segments on actual target hardware (e.g., GPU, CPU, Edge accelerator) to get accurate measurements. This is the most accurate but potentially slowest feedback loop.
    *   $w_{acc}, w_{lat}, w_{mem}, w_{eng}$ are weighting factors that allow tuning the trade-off based on specific deployment goals (e.g., prioritize latency over memory). These weights can be adjusted or incorporated into a multi-objective RL framework.

*   **RL Algorithm:** We will explore policy gradient methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) due to their stability and sample efficiency, or potentially simpler algorithms like Q-learning or multi-armed bandits if the state/action space allows. The RL agent will be trained iteratively, exploring different bit-width configurations and receiving rewards based on the resulting accuracy and hardware cost evaluations.

**3.3.4 Quantization-Aware Training/Fine-tuning (QAT):**
To enhance robustness to the assigned mixed-precision configuration, we will integrate quantization awareness during model training or fine-tuning.
*   **Approach:** We will adapt standard QAT techniques. During the forward pass, weights will be dynamically quantized according to the current policy's proposed bit-widths using Straight-Through Estimators (STE) for backpropagation through the non-differentiable rounding operation. The training objective remains the original task loss (e.g., cross-entropy).
*   **Co-design:** The QAT process can be interleaved with the RL policy training. For instance, the model is fine-tuned for several epochs with a fixed bit-width configuration proposed by the RL agent, then the RL agent updates its policy based on the performance of the fine-tuned model, and the cycle repeats. This allows the model weights and the quantization policy to adapt mutually.

**3.4 Experimental Design**
*   **Baselines:**
    *   Full Precision MoE (FP16/BF16): Upper bound on accuracy.
    *   Static Uniform Quantization: Apply uniform INT8, INT4 (or even lower, e.g., INT3/INT2 as in [1, 4]) quantization to all experts using standard post-training quantization (PTQ) and potentially QAT methods.
    *   Existing Mixed-Precision MoE Methods: Implement or compare against results from recent works like MiLo [1], MC-MoE [2], MoQa [3] if code/configurations are available or reproducible from papers. These represent the state-of-the-art in MoE-specific quantization.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Accuracy:** Perplexity (PPL) for language modeling; task-specific metrics (e.g., Accuracy for GLUE classification tasks, F1 score for SQuAD, BLEU score for translation). We aim for <1% accuracy degradation relative to the FP16 baseline or competitive results compared to other quantization methods.
    *   **Efficiency:**
        *   Inference Latency (ms per token/sequence).
        *   Throughput (tokens per second).
        *   Memory Footprint (GB/MB for model parameters). Reduction in activation memory (KV cache) can also be noted if applicable, though the focus is parameter quantization.
        *   Estimated Energy Consumption (Joules per inference, derived from hardware models or measurements).
*   **Hardware Targets:** Evaluations will primarily target standard GPU platforms (e.g., NVIDIA A100, V100) using libraries like TensorRT for optimized inference. We will also use performance models or simulators to estimate performance on representative CPU and potentially edge AI accelerator platforms (e.g., ARM cores, Edge TPUs) to demonstrate broader applicability.
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    *   Impact of RL vs. Heuristic Allocation: Compare the RL-derived policy against policies based solely on heuristics (e.g., quantize less frequent experts more aggressively).
    *   Importance of Hardware-in-the-Loop: Evaluate the performance difference when using only analytical hardware models versus incorporating direct hardware measurements in the RL reward.
    *   Contribution of QAT: Compare DMPQ with QAT versus DMPQ applied post-training (PTQ) to quantify the benefits of co-design.
    *   Sensitivity to RL Hyperparameters/Reward Weights: Analyze how different trade-off weights ($w_{acc}, w_{lat}$, etc.) affect the resulting accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier.
