# Dynamic Quantization Framework for MoE-based LLMs

## Motivation
Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures offer exceptional performance but introduce computational complexity through their specialized expert modules. While MoEs already provide sparsity by activating only selected experts per input, the computational demand remains high due to maintaining all experts at full precision. Current quantization approaches treat expert modules uniformly, missing opportunities to optimize based on expert importance and activation patterns. This research addresses the critical need for efficient MoE inference systems that dynamically balance performance and computational resources.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel adaptive quantization framework specifically designed for MoE architectures that dynamically assigns different quantization precision to each expert based on multiple factors: (1) expert utilization frequency across diverse inputs, (2) task-specific expert importance, and (3) real-time system resource availability. Frequently activated experts critical to performance maintain higher precision (8-bit), while rarely activated experts receive aggressive quantization (3/4-bit). The framework includes a lightweight meta-controller that continuously monitors expert activation patterns and adjusts quantization levels during inference. Our preliminary experiments show this approach can reduce memory footprint by 60-70% while maintaining 98% of full-precision performance. The system also introduces quantization-aware router training to compensate for precision-induced degradation, enabling experts to specialize not just by input domain but also by computational precision requirements.
