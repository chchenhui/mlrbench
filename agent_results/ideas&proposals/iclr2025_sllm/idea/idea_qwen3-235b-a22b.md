**Title: Code-Conditional Quantization for Sparsely Activated Mixture-of-Experts**  
**Motivation:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) leverage activation sparsity to scale efficiently, but deploying them on resource-constrained hardware remains challenging. While quantization reduces memory and computation, naively applying it uniformly across experts risks degrading critical pathways. A synergy between sparsity and quantization—optimized for the dynamic inferences of MoEs—is needed to balance efficiency and performance.  

**Main Idea:** We propose *code-conditional quantization*, where an MoE’s expert networks are quantized dynamically based on their routing context and functional importance. A learnable meta-controller analyzes historical activation patterns and task complexity to assign bit-widths: experts handling rare or redundant tasks are aggressively quantized, while pivotal experts retain higher precision. This code-specific quantization policy is co-optimized with the routing function during training via differentiable rounding techniques, ensuring gradient-guided alignment of sparsity and precision decisions. Expected outcomes include a 40%+ reduction in memory footprint and 30% faster inference with less than 1% accuracy loss on large-scale NLP tasks. The work bridges algorithm-hardware gaps by enabling adaptive quantization tailored to sparse compute patterns, directly addressing MoE deployment challenges in edge and low-power systems.
