**Title:** Concept Unlearning for Mitigating Societal Harms in Foundation Models

**Motivation:** Large foundation models often internalize and amplify societal biases, privacy risks, or toxic generation patterns present in their vast training data. Simply fine-tuning or filtering outputs is insufficient; we need methods to surgically remove harmful *concepts* learned by the model during pre-training without necessitating complete retraining or significantly degrading general capabilities.

**Main Idea:** We propose a "Concept Unlearning" framework to selectively erase harmful concepts (e.g., specific stereotypes, private information patterns, toxic associations) directly from model parameters. This involves first identifying the subspace or parameters strongly associated with the target harmful concept using advanced interpretability or representation analysis techniques. Subsequently, we apply targeted unlearning methods, such as constrained optimization minimizing concept expression, gradient ascent on a concept-negation loss, or projection-based parameter modifications, to neutralize the identified representations/parameters. The expected outcome is a model demonstrably less likely to exhibit the specific targeted harmful behavior, verified via specialized probes and evaluations, while retaining its core performance on general benchmarks. This offers a practical path towards safer large-scale AI.
