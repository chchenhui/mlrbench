# Preserving Robustness During Fine-tuning of Foundation Models: A Knowledge Distillation Approach

## Introduction

### Background
Foundation models have revolutionized the field of machine learning by demonstrating impressive performance on a wide range of tasks. These models, typically pretrained on large-scale datasets, can be adapted to various downstream tasks with relatively small amounts of task-specific data. However, one of the significant challenges in deploying foundation models in real-world applications is the issue of distribution shifts. Distribution shifts occur when a model is deployed on data that differs from the data distribution it was trained on, leading to a substantial degradation in performance. This problem is particularly acute in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, criminal justice, and education, where the data distribution can vary significantly across different institutions or populations.

### Research Objectives
The primary objective of this research is to develop a knowledge distillation framework that preserves the robustness of foundation models during fine-tuning for specialized tasks. Specifically, the research aims to:
1. Investigate the causes of robustness degradation during fine-tuning.
2. Design a robust teacher mechanism that guides the fine-tuning process.
3. Develop a hybrid loss function that combines task-specific performance with a distillation loss that penalizes deviations from the teacher's predictions on out-of-distribution examples.
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method using various benchmarks and real-world datasets.

### Significance
The proposed research is significant for several reasons:
1. **Improved Robustness**: The method aims to maintain the robustness of foundation models during fine-tuning, ensuring that they can handle distribution shifts effectively.
2. **High-Stakes Applications**: The research focuses on high-stakes domains where distribution shifts are inevitable and consequential, such as healthcare and criminal justice.
3. **Efficiency**: The proposed approach uses a knowledge distillation framework that is computationally efficient and can be integrated with existing fine-tuning techniques.
4. **Generalizability**: The method aims to generalize well across different distributions, ensuring that the fine-tuned models can adapt to a wide range of real-world scenarios.

## Methodology

### Research Design

#### Data Collection
The research will involve collecting datasets from various high-stakes domains, such as healthcare, criminal justice, and education. These datasets will include both in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples to evaluate the robustness of the fine-tuned models. Additionally, we will use existing benchmark datasets, such as the WILDS benchmark, to compare the performance of the proposed method with state-of-the-art approaches.

#### Algorithm Design
The proposed method consists of the following key components:

1. **Robustness Teacher Mechanism**: The original foundation model acts as a teacher that guides the fine-tuning process. During fine-tuning, the teacher model generates predictions on out-of-distribution examples using controlled perturbations and domain-specific transformations.

2. **Hybrid Loss Function**: The loss function used during fine-tuning consists of two components:
   - **Task-Specific Loss**: This component optimizes the model's performance on the specific task at hand.
   - **Distillation Loss**: This component penalizes deviations from the teacher's predictions on out-of-distribution examples. The distillation loss is calculated using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the student model's predictions and the teacher model's predictions.

   The hybrid loss function is defined as follows:
   \[
   \mathcal{L} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{distillation}}
   \]
   where \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}\) is the task-specific loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{distillation}}\) is the distillation loss, and \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\) are hyperparameters that control the relative importance of the two loss components.

3. **Activation Pattern Preservation**: To further enhance the robustness of the fine-tuned models, we introduce a regularization technique that explicitly preserves activation patterns from the pre-trained model on diverse inputs. This technique involves adding a regularization term to the loss function that penalizes deviations from the original activation patterns.

   The regularization term is defined as follows:
   \[
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}} = \sum_{i} \|\mathbf{a}_i^{\text{student}} - \mathbf{a}_i^{\text{teacher}}\|_2
   \]
   where \(\mathbf{a}_i^{\text{student}}\) and \(\mathbf{a}_i^{\text{teacher}}\) are the activation patterns of the student and teacher models, respectively, for the \(i\)-th input.

#### Experimental Design
To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we will conduct a series of experiments using the following experimental design:

1. **Baseline Comparison**: We will compare the performance of the proposed method with state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques, such as full-model fine-tuning and LoRA.
2. **Robustness Evaluation**: We will evaluate the robustness of the fine-tuned models by measuring their performance on out-of-distribution examples, using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.
3. **Task-Specific Performance**: We will evaluate the task-specific performance of the fine-tuned models using standard evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and F1 score.
4. **Computational Efficiency**: We will assess the computational efficiency of the proposed method by measuring the time and memory requirements of the fine-tuning process.

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Out-of-Distribution Robustness**: We will measure the performance of the fine-tuned models on out-of-distribution examples using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.
