**Title:** Robust Fine-Tuning of Foundation Regularization and Regularization and Synthetic OOD Augmentation  

**Motivation:** Fine-tuning foundation models on specialized tasks often degrades their out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, limiting real-world reliability. Addressing this is critical for deploying robust models in domains like healthcare or law, where distribution shifts are common but labeled OOD data is scarce.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a fine-tuning framework that preserves OOD robustness by combining consistency regularization and synthetic OOD data generation. Leverage the foundation model’s generative capabilities (e.g., text/code generation) to create diverse synthetic OOD samples via prompt engineering or latent space perturbations. During fine-tuning, enforce consistency between the original and fine-tuned model’s predictions on these synthetic samples using a KL-divergence loss, alongside task-specific training. This prevents overfitting to in-distribution data while retaining pretrained features crucial for robustness. Experiments on WILDS benchmarks and specialized domains (e.g., medical NLP) would validate improved OOD performance post-fine-tuning. Expected outcomes include a scalable adaptation method that bridges the gap between task-specific performance and robustness, enabling reliable deployment in shift-prone applications.
