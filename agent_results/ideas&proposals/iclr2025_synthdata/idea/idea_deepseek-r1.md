**Title:** Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in Language Models via Guided Synthetic Data Generation  

**Motivation:** While large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks, their mathematical reasoning remains limited due to scarce, high-quality training data. Real-world math datasets are often narrow in scope, lack step-by-step solutions, or suffer from privacy/copyright constraints. Synthetic data generation offers a scalable way to create diverse, curriculum-aligned math problems, addressing data scarcity and enabling targeted skill improvement.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a framework where a "teacher" LLM generates synthetic math problems and step-by-step solutions, guided by constraints (e.g., problem type, difficulty, pedagogical goals). A verification module filters incorrect or redundant examples using symbolic solvers and diversity metrics. The curated data trains a "student" model, iteratively refining generation based on student performance gaps. Experiments will compare models trained on synthetic vs. natural data using benchmarks like MATH and GSM8K, measuring accuracy, reasoning coherence, and generalization to unseen problem types.  

**Expected Outcomes & Impact:** This approach aims to boost mathematical reasoning in LLMs, particularly for underrepresented problem categories, while reducing reliance on proprietary or sensitive datasets. Successful implementation could democratize access to high-quality STEM training data, benefiting educational tools, research, and domain-specific AI applications. The methodology may also extend to other reasoning-heavy domains like coding or scientific analysis.
