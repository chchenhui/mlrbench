# Privacy-Preserving Adaptive Synthetic Data Generation Framework

## Motivation
Data access challenges in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance stem from stringent privacy regulations and ethical concerns. Traditional synthetic data often presents a difficult trade-off: either it closely resembles real data (raising privacy risks) or it's too dissimilar to be useful. This research addresses this fundamental challenge by creating a framework that adaptively balances privacy protection with data utility, enabling organizations to safely leverage sensitive data for machine learning applications without compromising individual privacy or data quality.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel framework that combines differential privacy guarantees with an adaptive synthesis mechanism that intelligently calibrates the privacy-utility trade-off. The system uses a two-phase approach: first, it performs domain-specific privacy risk assessment to identify sensitive attributes and relationships, then employs a multi-level generative model that adaptively applies different privacy preservation strengths to different data components. By incorporating privacy verification mechanisms and utility metrics directly into the generation process, the framework continuously optimizes the synthetic output. The approach includes privacy budgeting that allows organizations to explicitly control privacy-utility balance according to their specific use case. Our preliminary experiments in healthcare datasets show the framework can produce synthetic data that maintains statistical properties crucial for model training while providing mathematical privacy guarantees that meet regulatory requirements.
