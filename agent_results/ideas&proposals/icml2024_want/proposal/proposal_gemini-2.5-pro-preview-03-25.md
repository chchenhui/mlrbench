## 1. Title: Proactive Gradient-Aware Activation Checkpointing for Efficient Large-Scale Neural Network Training

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Background
The remarkable success of deep learning, particularly with the advent of extremely large models like Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs) (Vaswani et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2020), has revolutionized fields ranging from natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) to scientific discovery (Jumper et al., 2021). However, training these state-of-the-art models presents significant computational challenges. The memory required to store intermediate activations during the forward pass for subsequent gradient computation in the backward pass often exceeds the capacity of modern accelerators (e.g., GPUs), especially as model sizes scale into billions or trillions of parameters (Shoeybi et al., 2019).

Activation checkpointing, also known as re-materialization or gradient checkpointing (Chen et al., 2016; Gruslys et al., 2016), is a widely adopted technique to mitigate this memory bottleneck. By strategically discarding intermediate activations during the forward pass and recomputing them on demand during the backward pass, checkpointing trades increased computation for reduced memory footprint. This allows training significantly larger models than would otherwise be possible within given hardware constraints.

However, traditional checkpointing strategies often introduce substantial computational overhead due to the re-computation step. Existing approaches typically rely on static checkpointing schedules determined before training based on model structure (Chen et al., 2016), or dynamic strategies focusing primarily on memory management and computational graph structure, like Dynamic Tensor Rematerialization (DTR) (Kirisame et al., 2020). While effective in managing memory, these methods are often agnostic to the actual *importance* of the activations being recomputed concerning the learning process. For instance, Korthikanti et al. (2022) introduced selective activation recomputation heuristics, demonstrating significant speedups, but these heuristics are not directly informed by the gradient flow during training.

Especially in large models or during later stages of training, gradients associated with certain layers or activations can become very small or sparse (Han et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2024). Recomputing activations whose gradients are near-zero contributes negligibly to the parameter updates but incurs the full computational cost. This observation motivates our research: a significant portion of the re-computation performed by current checkpointing methods might be redundant from a learning perspective.

### 2.2 Research Objectives
This research proposes **Proactive Gradient-Aware Activation Checkpointing (PGA-AC)**, a novel strategy designed to optimize the trade-off between memory savings and re-computation overhead by incorporating gradient information into the checkpointing decision process. We aim to selectively checkpoint and subsequently avoid recomputing activations based on their estimated contribution to the overall gradient update.

Our primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop a gradient-aware checkpointing policy:** Design a mechanism that intelligently decides which activations to checkpoint based on the magnitude or estimated impact of their corresponding gradients during the backward pass.
2.  **Design efficient gradient impact estimation techniques:** Create lightweight methods to approximate the importance of an activation's gradient with minimal computational overhead during the backward pass, ensuring the estimation cost doesn't negate the re-computation savings.
3.  **Implement PGA-AC within distributed training frameworks:** Integrate the proposed PGA-AC strategy into standard large-scale training environments (e.g., PyTorch using Fully Sharded Data Parallelism - FSDP or similar libraries like DeepSpeed) with minimal disruption to existing workflows.
4.  **Empirically validate the effectiveness of PGA-AC:** Conduct comprehensive experiments on large-scale models (e.g., LLMs, Vision Transformers) to quantify the reduction in re-computation overhead, improvement in training throughput, and overall training time compared to baseline checkpointing methods.
5.  **Analyze the impact on model convergence and performance:** Ensure that the proposed optimization does not adversely affect the convergence dynamics or the final performance of the trained models.

### 2.3 Significance
The successful development and validation of PGA-AC would represent a significant advancement in efficient deep learning, directly addressing the core themes of the Workshop on Advancing Neural Network Training (WANT).

*   **Enhanced Computational Efficiency:** By minimizing redundant re-computations, PGA-AC aims to directly reduce the computational load associated with training large models, leading to faster training iterations and potentially lower energy consumption. This aligns with the workshop's focus on efficient computations and energy-efficient training.
*   **Improved Scalability:** Reducing the computational overhead of checkpointing can further push the boundaries of model size trainable on existing hardware, contributing to advancements in large-scale model training.
*   **Optimized Resource Utilization:** PGA-AC provides a more intelligent way to manage the compute-memory trade-off inherent in checkpointing, leading to better utilization of computational resources.
*   **Democratization of Large Model Training:** By lowering the computational cost, this research can make training large, powerful models more accessible to research groups and institutions with limited hardware resources, potentially accelerating innovation in various AI application domains, including AI for science and AI for good.
*   **Novel Technical Contribution:** This work introduces a new dimension – gradient awareness – to the established field of activation checkpointing, potentially inspiring further research into optimizing training dynamics based on gradient information flow.

Addressing the key challenges outlined in the literature review, such as balancing memory and computation, dynamic adaptation, efficient estimation, framework integration, and ensuring convergence, is central to this proposal and will demonstrate the practical viability of PGA-AC.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Overall Research Design
Our research will follow a structured approach involving algorithmic design, implementation, and rigorous empirical evaluation. We will first formalize the PGA-AC concept, then develop lightweight gradient impact estimation methods. Subsequently, we will implement PGA-AC within a popular deep learning framework (PyTorch) and evaluate its performance against standard checkpointing techniques across various large-scale models and tasks.

### 3.2 Data and Models
To ensure the generalizability and relevance of our findings, we will conduct experiments using representative large-scale models and datasets commonly used in the field:

*   **Models:**
    *   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** We will utilize variants of the GPT architecture (e.g., models similar in scale to GPT-2/3, LLaMA). We plan to experiment with models of varying sizes (e.g., 1B, 7B, potentially 30B+ parameters, budget permitting) to analyze the scalability of PGA-AC.
    *   **Vision Transformers (ViT):** To evaluate applicability beyond NLP, we will include ViT models (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) of different scales (e.g., ViT-Base, ViT-Large, ViT-Huge).
*   **Datasets:**
    *   **NLP:** Standard pre-training corpora like C4 (Common Crawl Colossal Cleaned Corpus), The Pile, or subsets thereof. Fine-tuning tasks might include GLUE benchmarks.
    *   **CV:** ImageNet-1k or ImageNet-21k for ViT pre-training/fine-tuning.

### 3.3 PGA-AC Algorithm Design

#### 3.3.1 Standard Activation Checkpointing Recap
In standard activation checkpointing, certain layers' outputs (activations) are designated as checkpoints during the forward pass. Non-checkpointed activations are discarded to save memory. During the backward pass, if a discarded activation $A_i$ is needed to compute the gradient for a preceding layer, the portion of the forward pass from the nearest preceding checkpoint up to layer $i$ is re-executed to recompute $A_i$. The choice of which activations to checkpoint is typically determined by algorithms aiming to minimize the re-computation cost given a memory budget, often based on the computational graph structure (e.g., checkpointing activations at boundaries of computationally intensive blocks).

#### 3.3.2 Proactive Gradient-Aware Checkpointing (PGA-AC) Logic
PGA-AC modifies the *decision* of whether an activation, which *could* be checkpointed according to a standard policy (or is a candidate for checkpointing), *should actually be stored* based on gradient information.

The core idea operates during the backward pass. Let $A_i$ be an activation tensor computed at layer $i$. Let $\nabla_{A_i} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial A_i}$ be the gradient of the loss $L$ with respect to $A_i$. Standard backpropagation computes $\nabla_{A_i}$ and uses it (along with potentially $A_i$ itself or preceding activations) to compute gradients for layer $i$'s parameters and the preceding activation $\nabla_{A_{i-1}}$.

In a typical checkpointing scenario integrated with backpropagation:
1.  Backward pass proceeds until it requires an activation $A_i$ that was discarded during the forward pass.
2.  $A_i$ is recomputed by executing the forward pass from the last available checkpoint up to layer $i$.
3.  Backward pass continues using the recomputed $A_i$.

PGA-AC introduces a modification, conceptually, to the initial checkpointing *decision* made during the forward pass, informed by gradient statistics gathered during training:

**Alternative View (More Practical Implementation):** Instead of modifying the forward pass decision based on future gradients (which isn't possible), we refine the interaction with the standard checkpointing mechanism. Many libraries (`torch.utils.checkpoint`, DeepSpeed) allow specifying segments of the model to checkpoint. PGA-AC aims to dynamically adjust *which* potential checkpoints are *actually saved* versus *always recomputed*, even if designated by the base strategy.

**Refined PGA-AC Logic during Backward Pass:**

1.  **Identify Candidate Activations:** Consider activations $A_i$ that a standard checkpointing strategy (like PyTorch's `checkpoint_sequential`) would normally save (checkpoint). Let this set be $S_{potential}$.
2.  **Gradient Impact Estimation:** When the gradient $\nabla_{A_i}$ for a *potential* checkpoint $A_i \in S_{potential}$ is computed during the backward pass (or just before $A_i$ would be needed if it *had* been discarded), estimate its impact $g_i = \text{EstimateImpact}(\nabla_{A_i})$.
3.  **Dynamic Checkpointing Decision (Conceptual Link):** Although the actual saving happened in the forward pass, we use this gradient information to *inform future checkpointing decisions* (for the next iteration or dynamically adjusting within an iteration if the framework permits) or to *manage recomputation differently* if possible (though typically recomputation is mandatory if not saved). More practically, PGA-AC uses gradient insight to refine the set $S_{actual} \subseteq S_{potential}$ that gets checkpointed on the *next* forward pass, or adjusts parameters of an existing dynamic strategy.

    *   **Main Implementation Strategy:** Modify checkpointing libraries to incorporate gradient statistics. For `torch.utils.checkpoint` applied to a model segment, instead of always checkpointing the segment's input/output, make it conditional. During the backward pass of iteration $t$, collect gradient statistics for activations at checkpoint boundaries. Use these statistics to decide whether to activate checkpointing for that segment in iteration $t+1$.

4.  **Gradient Impact Estimation Methods $g_i = \text{EstimateImpact}(\nabla_{A_i})$:** This is critical and must be computationally cheap. We will explore:
    *   **Norm-Based Proxies:**
        *   Maximum Absolute Value: $g_i = ||\text{vec}(\nabla_{A_i})||_\infty$. Very cheap to compute.
        *   Sampled L1/L2 Norm: Compute the norm on a small, fixed random subset of elements in $\nabla_{A_i}$. Needs careful sampling strategy. $g_i \approx \sqrt{\frac{N}{k} \sum_{j=1}^k (\nabla_{A_i}^{(s_j)})^2}$, where $N = |\nabla_{A_i}|$ and $k \ll N$ samples $s_j$ are used.
        *   Scaled L1 Norm: $g_i = \frac{1}{N} ||\text{vec}(\nabla_{A_i})||_1$. Measures average magnitude. Relatively cheap.
    *   **Statistical Proxies:** Maintain running statistics (e.g., Exponential Moving Average - EMA) of gradient norms or magnitudes for specific layers or activation types across training iterations. $g_i(t) = \text{EMA}(\text{Norm}(\nabla_{A_i}), \text{decay_rate})$. The decision can be based on the current gradient's deviation from the historical average.
    *   **Gradient Sparsity:** Measure the fraction of near-zero elements in $\nabla_{A_i}$. $g_i = \frac{|\{x \in \nabla_{A_i} : |x| > \epsilon\}|}{N}$. If sparsity is very high, the impact might be low.

5.  **Dynamic Thresholding $\tau(t, l)$:** The criterion for checkpointing $A_i$ will be $g_i > \tau(t, l)$. The threshold $\tau$ should adapt:
    *   **Iteration-Dependent:** $\tau$ could decrease as training progresses (as gradients might generally decrease or stabilize). $\tau(t) = \tau_0 \cdot e^{-kt}$.
    *   **Layer-Dependent:** Different layers might have inherently different gradient scales. $\tau(l)$ could be set relative to observed average gradient magnitudes for that layer.
    *   **Budget-Aware:** Adjust $\tau$ dynamically to maintain a target memory footprint or a target ratio of skipped re-computations (e.g., aim to skip re-computation for the 20% lowest-impact activations among candidates). This could involve sorting estimated impacts $g_i$ across candidate activations in a backward pass and setting $\tau$ based on a quantile.
    *   **Adaptive based on EMA:** Set $\tau(t, l)$ relative to the EMA of gradient impacts for that layer. E.g., $\tau(t, l) = c \cdot \text{EMA}_t(g_l)$, where $c < 1$ is a sensitivity parameter.

#### 3.3.3 Implementation within Distributed Frameworks
We plan to implement PGA-AC primarily using PyTorch.

*   **Hooks:** Utilize PyTorch's forward and backward hooks to access activations and gradients. Backward hooks can be used to compute gradient impact $g_i$ when $\nabla_{A_i}$ becomes available.
*   **Custom Checkpointing Function:** Wrap or modify existing checkpointing functions like `torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint` or `torch.distributed.algorithms._checkpoint_wrapper.checkpoint_wrapper`. The custom function will incorporate the logic to conditionally execute the re-computation based on stored gradient statistics from previous iterations or use hooks to dynamically adjust checkpointing behavior if the framework allows.
*   **Integration with FSDP/DeepSpeed:** Investigate how to integrate PGA-AC with distributed training strategies. For FSDP, checkpointing is often applied via `checkpoint_wrapper`. We would need to modify this wrapper or the underlying logic to incorporate our gradient-aware policy. This might involve communicating gradient statistics across ranks if tensor parallelism is used, adding communication overhead that must be carefully managed. We will start with Data Parallelism (DDP/FSDP) where activation checkpointing is local to each rank.

### 3.4 Experimental Design

*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **No Checkpointing:** Train the model without any activation checkpointing (if feasible on available hardware for smaller model configurations, mainly to establish a performance ceiling).
    2.  **Standard Checkpointing:** Use the default activation checkpointing strategy provided by the framework (e.g., PyTorch's `checkpoint_sequential` selecting layers heuristically, or DeepSpeed's default).
    3.  **Optimal Static Checkpointing (Simulation):** If possible, use offline algorithms (like Checkmake or MONeT) to determine a theoretically optimal static checkpointing schedule for comparison, though these often don't account for dynamic gradient behavior.
    4.  **Dynamic Tensor Rematerialization (DTR):** Compare against DTR (Kirisame et al., 2020) if feasible to implement or available in libraries, representing a state-of-the-art dynamic (but gradient-agnostic) approach.
*   **Experimental Setup:**
    *   Train selected LLMs and ViTs on relevant datasets using standard hyperparameters (e.g., AdamW optimizer, learning rate schedules).
    *   Employ distributed training across multiple GPUs (e.g., 8-64 A100/H100 GPUs) using PyTorch DDP/FSDP.
    *   Vary the PGA-AC configuration: different gradient impact estimators ($g_i$), different thresholding strategies ($\tau$).
    *   Measure performance across different stages of training (early, mid, late).
    *   Control for memory budgets: Configure standard checkpointing and PGA-AC to target similar peak memory usage if possible, to isolate the effect on computation time.
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    *   Evaluate the overhead of different $g_i$ estimation methods.
    *   Analyze the sensitivity of PGA-AC to the threshold $\tau$ and the adaptation strategy.
    *   Compare performance when PGA-AC decides based on layer type versus actual gradient measurement.

### 3.5 Evaluation Metrics

*   **Primary Metrics (Efficiency):**
    *   **Training Throughput:** Measured in samples/second or tokens/second. Higher is better.
    *   **Wall-Clock Time to Convergence:** Total time taken to reach a target validation metric (e.g., loss, perplexity, accuracy). Lower is better.
    *   **Re-computation Ratio/Time:** Profile the proportion of backward pass time spent on recomputing activations. PGA-AC should reduce this compared to standard AC.
    *   **Peak Activation Memory:** Measure the maximum memory consumed by activations per GPU. Should be comparable to standard AC for a fair comparison of compute time.
    *   **GPU Utilization / FLOPs Utilization:** Measure achievable TFLOPs/s to understand hardware efficiency.
*   **Secondary Metrics (Model Quality):**
    *   **Convergence Curves:** Plot training and validation loss/metrics versus training steps and wall-clock time. Curves should closely match baselines.
    *   **Final Model Performance:** Evaluate the final trained model on standard downstream tasks or held-out validation sets to ensure no degradation in accuracy, perplexity, etc.
*   **Overhead Metrics:**
    *   **Gradient Estimation Overhead:** Measure the time spent computing $g_i$ per backward pass. Must be significantly smaller than the saved re-computation time.
    *   **Framework Integration Complexity:** Qualitative assessment of ease of implementation and use.
