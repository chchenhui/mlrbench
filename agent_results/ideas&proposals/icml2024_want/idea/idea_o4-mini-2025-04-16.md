Title: Adaptive Layer-Wise Offloading and Checkpointing for Energy-Efficient Large-Scale Model Training

Motivation:  
Training ever-larger neural networks strains GPU memory, increases energy costs, and limits accessibility for smaller research teams. By intelligently balancing computation and data placement, we can reduce resource bottlenecks and democratize large-scale model training.

Main Idea:  
We propose a multi-objective reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler that, for each network layer, dynamically chooses among (1) rematerialization (recompute activations), (2) offloading to CPU DRAM, or (3) offloading to NVMe storage. At runtime the system profiles layer compute cost, memory footprint, and host–device bandwidth, feeding these metrics into the RL agent to optimize a reward combining training throughput, peak memory usage, and energy consumption. Implemented atop PyTorch and CUDA, our prototype will be evaluated on Transformer and vision-transformer benchmarks across GPU-CPU clusters. We expect ≥40% peak GPU memory reduction and ≥30% energy savings with <10% training-time overhead, enabling cost-effective, large-scale model development in resource-constrained environments.
