1. **Title**: Dynamic Sparsity-Aware Activation Checkpointing for Memory-Efficient Transformer Training  

2. **Motivation**: Training large Transformers is constrained by GPU memory, especially for tasks like NLP or climate modeling with long sequences. Existing activation checkpointing methods save activations at fixed intervals, which fails to account for architecture heterogeneity (e.g., varying attention head sizes) and hardware efficiency trade-offs. This leads to suboptimal memory budgets and slower throughputs, limiting accessibility for smaller teams and hindering AI for science applications.  

3. **Main Idea**: Propose a sparsity-aware activation checkpointing framework that dynamically selects *which* activations to save per layer based on their gradient importance and hardware memory hierarchy. Our key innovation: (1) A lightweight Transformer sublayer module that analyzes activation sparsity patterns (e.g., using magnitude thresholds or attention masks) during forward passes, and (2) a policy network trained to predict optimal checkpointing locations by modeling the trade-off between recomputation cost and memory constraints. The policy uses layer-specific metadata (e.g., sequence length, head count) and real-time GPU utilization. Experiments will compare memory savings and training speed against traditional checkpointing methods on vision Transformers (ViT) and LLMs (e.g., Llama-3), targeting 20%â€“30% higher batch sizes at equivalent accuracy. This could enable efficient finetuning of 100B+ models on modest clusters and improve energy efficiency for green AI.
