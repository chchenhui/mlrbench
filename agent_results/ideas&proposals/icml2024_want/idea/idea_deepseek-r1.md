**Title:** Adaptive Gradient Sparsification for Communication-Efficient Distributed Training  

**Motivation:** As neural networks grow in scale, distributed training communication overhead becomes a bottleneck, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Frequent gradient synchronization across devices consumes significant time and energy, hindering scalability and accessibility for smaller research teams.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes an adaptive gradient sparsification framework that dynamically adjusts the volume of communicated gradients based on their significance. By analyzing gradient magnitudes in real-time, the method identifies and transmits only the most impactful gradients, employing a dynamic threshold that evolves with training phases (e.g., stricter early, relaxed later). A lightweight metadata scheme ensures synchronization alignment across nodes. The approach integrates with existing backpropagation workflows using PyTorch or TensorFlow hooks.  

**Expected Outcomes:** Reduced communication costs by 40â€“60% compared to standard AllReduce, minimal accuracy loss (<1% on benchmarks like ResNet-50 and GPT-2), and faster convergence via prioritized parameter updates.  

**Potential Impact:** Enables efficient large-scale training on limited hardware, democratizing access to cutting-edge AI development and reducing energy consumption for sustainable AI advancement.
