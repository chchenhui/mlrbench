### Title: "Automated Detection of Spurious Correlations in Multimodal Data"

### Motivation
Spurious correlations and shortcut learning pose significant challenges to the robustness and reliability of AI systems, particularly in multimodal data settings. These issues lead to models that fail to generalize well, especially in real-world scenarios involving under-represented groups or minority populations. Developing automated methods to detect spurious correlations in multimodal data is crucial for improving the reliability and fairness of AI systems.

### Main Idea
The proposed research focuses on creating an automated framework for detecting spurious correlations in multimodal data. The framework will leverage advanced machine learning techniques, such as contrastive learning and self-supervised learning, to identify and mitigate spurious correlations. The methodology involves:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Use domain-specific preprocessing techniques to ensure high-quality multimodal data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Apply multimodal feature extraction methods to capture relevant features from different modalities (e.g., image, text, audio).
3. **Contrastive Learning**: Utilize contrastive learning techniques to learn robust representations that minimize spurious correlations.
4. **Spurious Correlation Detection**: Develop a novel algorithm to detect spurious correlations by comparing the learned representations against known spurious patterns.
5. **Evaluation and Benchmarking**: Create comprehensive evaluation benchmarks to assess the robustness of the framework across various multimodal datasets.

The expected outcomes include:

- A robust and scalable framework for detecting spurious correlations in multimodal data.
- Improved fairness and reliability of AI systems by reducing reliance on spurious patterns.
- New datasets and benchmarks to evaluate the performance of spurious correlation detection methods.

The potential impact of this research is significant, as it will contribute to the development of more reliable and ethical AI systems, particularly in domains where multimodal data is prevalent, such as healthcare, social media, and industrial automation.
