Adaptive Invariant Feature Extraction using Synthetic Interventions (AIFS)

## 2. Introduction

### Background

Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success across various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. However, these models often exhibit a reliance on spurious correlations, which are patterns in the data that do not reflect underlying causal relationships. This reliance can lead to poor generalization and robustness, particularly when the model encounters data distributions that differ from the training distribution. Spurious correlations can arise from various sources, including data preprocessing, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. Understanding and mitigating these issues is crucial for developing more reliable and ethical AI systems.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a novel method called Adaptive Invariant Feature Extraction using Synthetic Interventions (AIFS) that can automatically discover and neutralize hidden spurious factors in deep learning models. The key goals of AIFS are:

1. **Automatic Discovery of Spurious Features**: AIFS aims to identify spurious features without requiring explicit supervision or annotations.
2. **Neutralization of Spurious Factors**: The method should effectively remove the reliance on spurious features, allowing the model to focus on truly causal patterns.
3. **Improved Robustness and Generalization**: By mitigating spurious correlations, AIFS should enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of deep learning models.

### Significance

The significance of this research lies in its potential to address a fundamental challenge in deep learning: the reliance on spurious correlations. By developing a method that can automatically discover and neutralize these hidden factors, AIFS can contribute to the development of more reliable and ethical AI systems. Furthermore, the research can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of deep learning models and the factors that contribute to their effectiveness and generalization.

## 3. Methodology

### Research Design

AIFS integrates a generative intervention loop into the training process of deep learning models. The method consists of the following key components:

1. **Pretrained Encoder**: A pretrained encoder maps inputs into a latent representation.
2. **Intervention Module**: A lightweight module applies randomized "style" perturbations in selected latent subspaces to simulate distributional shifts.
3. **Dual-Objective Loss**: A loss function that encourages the classifier to maintain consistent predictions under these interventions (invariance) while penalizing over-reliance on perturbed dimensions (sensitivity loss).
4. **Gradient-Based Attribution**: Periodically, gradient-based attribution identifies the most sensitive latent directions, which are then prioritized for future interventions.

### Data Collection

For the purpose of this research, we will use publicly available datasets that contain hidden spurious correlations. These datasets will be used to evaluate the performance of AIFS and compare it with existing methods. Some potential datasets include:

- **Image Benchmarks**: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, which contain spurious correlations related to object attributes.
- **Tabular Benchmarks**: Adult, Credit, and Compas datasets, which contain hidden spurious correlations related to demographic attributes.

### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Initialization**:
    - Initialize the pretrained encoder and the intervention module.
    - Set the initial parameters for the dual-objective loss and the gradient-based attribution mechanism.

2. **Intervention Loop**:
    - For each epoch:
        a. Apply randomized "style" perturbations in selected latent subspaces using the intervention module.
        b. Forward propagate the perturbed inputs through the pretrained encoder to obtain the latent representations.
        c. Calculate the dual-objective loss, which includes an invariance term and a sensitivity loss.
        d. Backpropagate the loss to update the model parameters.

3. **Gradient-Based Attribution**:
    - Periodically, apply gradient-based attribution to identify the most sensitive latent directions.
    - Prioritize these directions for future interventions.

4. **Model Training**:
    - Continue the intervention loop for a fixed number of epochs or until convergence.
    - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using standard evaluation metrics.

### Mathematical Formulation

The dual-objective loss function can be formulated as follows:

\[ \mathcal{L}(x, y) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{inv}}(x, y) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{sens}}(x, y) \]

where:
- \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{inv}}(x, y) \) is the invariance loss, which encourages consistent predictions under interventions.
- \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{sens}}(x, y) \) is the sensitivity loss, which penalizes over-reliance on perturbed dimensions.
- \( \lambda \) is a hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between invariance and sensitivity.

The invariance loss can be calculated as:

\[ \mathcal{L}_{\text{inv}}(x, y) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathcal{L}_{\text{class}}(x_i, y_i) \]

where \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{class}}(x_i, y_i) \) is the classification loss for the \( i \)-th sample.

The sensitivity loss can be calculated as:

\[ \mathcal{L}_{\text{sens}}(x, y) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{\text{class}}(x_i, y_i)}{\partial \theta} \cdot \theta \]

where \( \theta \) represents the latent representation of the \( i \)-th sample.

### Experimental Design

To validate the method, we will conduct experiments on image and tabular benchmarks with hidden spurious correlations. The evaluation metrics will include:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions on the test set.
- **Worst-Group Accuracy**: The accuracy on the group with the lowest performance, which is a measure of group fairness.
- **Robustness**: The model's performance on perturbed inputs, which simulates real-world scenarios where data distributions differ from the training distribution.
