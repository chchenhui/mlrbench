**Research Proposal: Cross-Modality Representation Alignment via Optimal Transport for Seamless Model Merging**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Biological and artificial neural systems exhibit striking similarities in their learned representations when exposed to analogous stimuli. This phenomenon, observed across neuroscience and machine learning (ML), underscores a fundamental principle: learning processes drive the emergence of invariant structures in latent spaces. In artificial intelligence, this has inspired efforts to merge pre-trained models—leveraging their complementary knowledge for tasks requiring multimodal reasoning. However, merging models trained on distinct modalities (e.g., vision and language) remains challenging due to incompatible latent geometries. Optimal transport (OT), a mathematical framework for aligning distributions, offers a principled way to bridge these gaps by identifying semantically consistent mappings between modalities.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research aims to:  
1. Develop an OT-based framework for aligning cross-modal latent spaces to enable seamless model merging.  
2. Ensure the invertibility and identifiability of mappings to preserve the functionality of individual models post-alignment.  
3. Validate the approach through multimodal tasks (e.g., visual question answering) and compare it to jointly trained or naively merged models.  
4. Analyze the theoretical conditions under which alignment achieves semantic consistency and computational efficiency.  

**Significance**  
Aligning multimodal representations unlocks applications such as efficient model reuse, reduced training costs, and enhanced performance in robotics and embodied AI. By addressing the incompatibility of pre-trained models, this work bridges the gap between theoretical insights into representation learning and practical deployment of modular AI systems.

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### **2.1 Data Collection and Preparation**  
- **Datasets**: Use paired cross-modal datasets (e.g., COCO for image-text pairs, HowTo100M for video-audio-text) and benchmarks like Visual Question Answering (VQA-v2) and CrossModal-Net.  
- **Pre-trained Models**: Leverage uni-modal architectures (e.g., ViT for vision, BERT for text) with pre-trained weights.  
- **Data Augmentation**: Generate synthetic paired data via diffusion models (e.g., DALL·E 3) to mitigate data scarcity.  

#### **2.2 Cross-Modality Representation Alignment via Optimal Transport**  
**Optimal Transport Formulation**  
Let $X$ (vision) and $Y$ (text) represent samples from two modalities. For paired data $(x_i, y_i)$, their latent features $z_x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $z_y \in \mathbb{R}^d$ are extracted from pre-trained encoders. We compute an OT plan $\mathbf{P} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ by minimizing the Wasserstein distance:  
$$
\min_{\mathbf{P} \in \Gamma(\mu, \nu)} \sum_{i,j} C_{i,j} P_{i,j} + \lambda H(\mathbf{P}),
$$  
where $C_{i,j} = \|z_x^{(i)} - z_y^{(j)}\|^2$, $\Gamma$ enforces marginal constraints, $H(\mathbf{P})$ is entropy regularization, and $\lambda$ controls smoothness.  

**Alignment via Sinkhorn-Knopp Algorithm**  
The transport plan $\mathbf{P}$ is approximated iteratively using the Sinkhorn algorithm:  
$$
\mathbf{P} = \text{diag}(\mathbf{u}) \cdot e^{-C / \lambda} \cdot \text{diag}(\mathbf{v}),
$$  
where $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}$ are scaling vectors updated via marginals. A shared latent space is derived by mapping $z_x$ and $z_y$ using $\mathbf{P}$, ensuring:  
$$
\tilde{z}_x = \mathbf{P} z_y, \quad \tilde{z}_y = \mathbf{P}^\top z_x.
$$  

#### **2.3 Post-Alignment Model Fusion**  
Aligned representations are fused using adaptive cross-attention layers to enable joint reasoning. For two aligned features $\tilde{z}_x, \tilde{z}_y$, the fused output $\mathbf{f}$ is:  
$$
\mathbf{f} = \text{Softmax}\left(\frac{(\tilde{z}_x W_Q)(\tilde{z}_y W_K)^\top}{\sqrt{d}}\right) \cdot (\tilde{z}_y W_V),
$$  
where $W_Q, W_K, W_V$ are learnable projections. A residual connection preserves original modalities.  

#### **2.4 Identifiability Analysis**  
To ensure mappings are invertible, we enforce bijectivity by constraining $\mathbf{P}$ to be orthogonal during optimization. A secondary loss regularizes the Jacobian determinant of the transport map:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{inv}} = \|\mathbf{P}^\top \mathbf{P} - \mathbf{I}\|_F^2.
$$  

#### **2.5 Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against (1) Jointly trained models, (2) Naive merging (concatenation), and (3) Other alignment methods (CCA, MMD).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Alignment Quality**: Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).  
  - **Task Performance**: Accuracy (VQA), BLEU (translation), FID (image-text coherence).  
  - **Computational Efficiency**: Training time, memory footprint.  
- **Ablation Studies**: Test the impact of OT regularization, fusion layers, and identifiability constraints.
