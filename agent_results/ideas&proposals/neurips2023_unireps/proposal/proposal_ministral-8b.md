# Cross-Modality Representation Alignment via Optimal Transport for Seamless Model Merging

## 1. Introduction

### Background

The convergence of neural models from different modalities (e.g., vision, language) in learning similar representations has sparked significant interest across neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. This phenomenon is evident in various scenarios, such as when different individuals are exposed to the same stimulus or in different initializations of the same neural architecture. The alignment of these representations holds immense potential for model merging, stitching, and reuse, facilitating efficient cross-modal knowledge transfer and enhancing multimodal system performance. However, the incompatibility of latent representations from distinct modalities poses a significant challenge to achieving this goal.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a framework that leverages optimal transport (OT) to align latent spaces of uni-modal models into a shared geometry. This framework aims to minimize the Wasserstein distance between feature distributions of paired cross-modal data, preserving semantic relationships. Post-alignment, the transformed representations will be fused via adaptive cross-attention layers, enabling merged models to perform joint tasks without retraining from scratch. The research also includes an identifiability analysis to ensure that the mappings are both identifiable and invertible, maintaining individual model functionality post-alignment.

### Significance

The successful development of this framework would democratize model reuse across modalities, reduce computational costs, and advance applications requiring synergistic reasoning, such as robotics and embodied AI. By aligning latent spaces, we can unlock efficient cross-modal knowledge transfer, reduce redundant training, and enhance multimodal system performance.

## 2. Methodology

### Research Design

#### Data Collection

The data for this research will be collected from publicly available multimodal datasets, such as CLIP-aligned datasets and multimodal QA tasks. These datasets provide paired cross-modal data (e.g., image-text pairs) that are essential for training the optimal transport-based alignment method.

#### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract feature representations from pre-trained uni-modal models (e.g., vision and language models) using their respective encoders. Let $F_v(x)$ represent the feature vector of an input image $x$ from the vision model, and $F_t(y)$ represent the feature vector of an input text $y$ from the language model.

2. **Optimal Transport Alignment**: Apply optimal transport to align the feature distributions of paired cross-modal data. The goal is to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the feature distributions of paired cross-modal data. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

   $$
   \min_{\gamma \in \Gamma(F_v, F_t)} \int_{X \times Y} c(x, y) \, d\gamma(x, y)
   $$

   where $c(x, y)$ is the cost function, and $\gamma$ is the optimal transport plan. The optimal transport plan $\gamma$ is obtained by solving the dual problem:

   $$
   \max_{\pi \in \Pi(F_v, F_t)} \int_{X \times Y} \pi(x, y) \, d\gamma(x, y)
   $$

   where $\pi$ is the marginal distribution, and $\Pi(F_v, F_t)$ is the set of all possible joint distributions.

3. **Adaptive Cross-Attention Fusion**: Post-alignment, the transformed representations are fused using adaptive cross-attention layers. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features from both modalities, enhancing the performance of joint tasks. The attention weights are calculated as:

   $$
   \alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp(Q_i K_j^T)}{\sum_{k} \exp(Q_i K_k^T)}
   $$

   where $Q_i$ and $K_j$ are the query and key matrices, respectively.

4. **Identifiability Analysis**: Ensure that the mappings established through optimal transport are both identifiable and invertible. This analysis will involve evaluating the invertibility of the alignment process and ensuring that the individual models retain their functionality post-alignment.

#### Experimental Design

The framework will be evaluated on benchmarks such as CLIP-aligned datasets and multimodal QA tasks. The performance of the merged models will be compared against jointly trained models to validate the effectiveness of the alignment method. Evaluation metrics will include accuracy, F1 score, and BLEU score, depending on the specific task.
