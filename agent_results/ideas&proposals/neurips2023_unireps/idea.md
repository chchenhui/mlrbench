**Title:** Cross-Modality Representation Alignment via Optimal Transport for Seamless Model Merging  

**Motivation:** Merging pre-trained models from distinct modalities (e.g., vision and language) is hindered by incompatible latent representations, limiting their collaborative potential. Aligning these representations could unlock efficient cross-modal knowledge transfer, reduce redundant training, and enhance multimodal system performance.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a framework leveraging optimal transport (OT) to align latent spaces of uni-modal models into a shared geometry. For paired cross-modal data (e.g., image-text pairs), OT-based matching minimizes the Wasserstein distance between their feature distributions, preserving semantic relationships. Post-alignment, transformed representations are fused via adaptive cross-attention layers, enabling merged models to perform joint tasks (e.g., visual question answering) *without* retraining from scratch. The approach includes an identifiability analysis to ensure invertible mappings, maintaining individual model functionality. Experiments on benchmarks like CLIP-aligned datasets and multimodal QA tasks would validate performance against jointly trained models. If successful, this method would democratize model reuse across modalities, reduce compute costs, and advance applications requiring synergistic reasoning (e.g., robotics, embodied AI).
