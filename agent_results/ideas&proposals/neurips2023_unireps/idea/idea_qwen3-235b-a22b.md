1. **Title**: Causal Disentanglement for Unifying Neural Representations  

2. **Motivation**: Current neural models often develop superficially divergent representations despite learning from similar stimuli, hindering interoperability. Existing methods for aligning representations focus on statistical correlations, which may not capture causalityâ€”the core invariance naturally enforced during learning. Unifying representations through causal disentanglement could bridge gaps between architectures, modalities, and initialization conditions while improving robustness to distributional shifts.  

3. **Main Idea**: Propose a training framework that merges **causal disentanglement** with **cross-model alignment**. By enforcing neural representations to align with *causal factors* of data via (1) nonlinear ICA-like constraints (latent variable modeling under independence assumptions) and (2) mutual information maximization across transformations (e.g., data augmentations), models learn to prioritize invariant mechanisms. A **universal causal coordinate system** is induced by constraining latent spaces to reflect sparse causal dependencies across inputs (e.g., physical laws in vision, syntax in language). Cross-model compatibility is enhanced through a **contrastive alignment loss** that ensures shared causal factors are preserved across different architectures. Evaluate alignment quality via parameter net-flip corrections (to resolve non-identifiability) and downstream task transfer between models. Expected outcomes include interpretable representations with improved stitching/merging in multimodal settings and robustness to domain shifts. Impact spans modular AI design, neuroscience-inspired model analysis, and efficient deployment of heterogeneous systems.
