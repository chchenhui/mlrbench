# Representation Similarity Metrics for Neural Merging (RSM-NM)

## Motivation
Despite the growing interest in model merging and representational alignment, we lack robust quantitative metrics to determine when and how neural representations can be effectively combined. Current approaches often rely on heuristics or trial-and-error, limiting the potential for systematic model fusion. This research addresses a critical gap in unifying representations across neural models by establishing principled metrics that predict successful merging outcomes before computational resources are invested in the actual merging process.

## Main Idea
RSM-NM introduces a framework of complementary metrics to quantify representational compatibility between neural networks prior to merging. We propose three core metrics: (1) Functional Similarity Index (FSI) - measuring overlap in activation patterns across shared input distributions, (2) Gradient Alignment Score (GAS) - quantifying the directional similarity of parameter updates, and (3) Subspace Compatibility Measure (SCM) - evaluating the geometric relationship between representation manifolds. These metrics will be combined into a single predictive score using a meta-learning approach trained on successful and unsuccessful merging examples. The framework will be validated across modalities (vision, language) and architectures (CNNs, Transformers). Beyond prediction, RSM-NM will guide targeted interventions to enhance compatibility before merging, substantially improving the efficiency and performance of merged models while providing insights into the underlying principles of neural representation similarity.
