# Self-Supervised Disentanglement with Causal Discovery for Robust Visual Representations

## Motivation
Current deep learning visual systems excel at pattern recognition but are vulnerable to distribution shifts and struggle with counterfactual reasoning. They often conflate spurious correlations with causal relationships, leading to poor generalization in real-world scenarios. Addressing this limitation is crucial for deploying AI in critical domains like healthcare and autonomous driving, where understanding causal factors—not just correlations—is essential for reliable decision-making and resilience to environmental changes.

## Main Idea
I propose a self-supervised framework that jointly learns disentangled visual representations and discovers their causal relationships without explicit supervision. The approach combines variational autoencoders with a novel causal discovery mechanism that identifies latent causal variables from unlabeled image data. By enforcing sparsity constraints and leveraging natural data augmentations as implicit interventions, the model learns to separate causally independent factors of variation while capturing their dependency structure. This framework introduces a causal consistency loss that ensures representations maintain their causal properties across transformations, and employs a contrastive learning objective modified to respect the discovered causal structure. The resulting representations support intervention-based reasoning, enabling the system to predict counterfactual outcomes under hypothetical scenarios. Evaluation on domain generalization benchmarks will demonstrate superior robustness to distribution shifts compared to traditional representation learning approaches.
