**Title:** *Learning Physics-Compatible Causal Representations for Generalization in Dynamical Systems*  

**Motivation:**  
Modern ML models struggle to extrapolate beyond training data distributions and adapt to interventions. In domains like physics or robotics, where systems are governed by invariant causal laws (e.g., Newtonian mechanics), learning representations that align with these laws could enable robust prediction and planning under distributional shifts. Existing methods often ignore physical constraints, leading to brittle models. This work bridges causal representation learning (CRL) and physics-informed system identification to address this gap.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a self-supervised framework to learn causal representations that encode physical laws (e.g., conservation of energy) directly from high-dimensional observations (e.g., video of a pendulum). The method combines Hamiltonian mechanics with CRL: a neural encoder maps raw data to latent causal variables (e.g., position, momentum), while a learned Hamiltonian function defines their dynamics via Hamiltonâ€™s equations. To ensure physical compatibility, we regularize the latent space to satisfy known symmetries (e.g., rotational invariance) and conservation laws. The model is trained on multi-environment data (e.g., varying masses, friction coefficients) to enforce causal invariance. For counterfactual reasoning, interventions (e.g., changing mass) are modeled as modifications to the Hamiltonian. We evaluate generalization on unseen initial conditions, external forces, and system parameters, benchmarking against purely statistical and physics-agnostic CRL baselines. Success would enable interpretable, extrapolatable models for scientific discovery and robotics.
