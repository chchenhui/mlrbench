**Title:** Causal Structure Alignment for Robust Sim-to-Real Transfer in Robotics

**Motivation:** Robotic agents trained in simulation often fail in the real world due to distribution shifts and learning spurious correlations. Causal Representation Learning (CRL) promises robustness, but obtaining interventional data on real robots is difficult and costly. Bridging this gap requires leveraging simulation effectively while ensuring real-world applicability.

**Main Idea:** We propose learning causal representations (latent variables and their causal graph) from rich interventional data readily available in simulation. We will then develop a novel domain adaptation technique for sim-to-real transfer that explicitly aligns the *causal structure* learned in simulation with observational (and potentially limited interventional) data from the real world. Instead of merely aligning visual feature distributions, this method focuses on preserving the identified causal relationships between latent factors relevant to the task (e.g., object pose, robot joint state, contact forces). Expected outcomes include robotic policies exhibiting significantly improved zero-shot or few-shot generalization to real-world variations compared to standard domain randomization or representation alignment techniques. This directly addresses the practical application of CRL in robotics.
