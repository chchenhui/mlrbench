Title  
Diffusion-Guided Exploration for Sample‐Efficient Reinforcement Learning in Sparse Reward Environments  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Reinforcement learning (RL) in high‐dimensional, sparse‐reward tasks remains a major challenge due to the prohibitive number of environment interactions required for an agent to discover reward‐bearing behaviors. Traditional intrinsic motivation and curiosity‐based methods, such as Random Network Distillation (RND) or Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), improve exploration by rewarding novelty but often fail in long‐horizon tasks with complex dynamics. Meanwhile, diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors that capture the manifold of realistic data sequences without relying on reward labels. Recent work in video diffusion and behavior diffusion (e.g., “Diffusion Reward” 2023; “Gen-Drive” 2024; DDPO 2023) suggests that diffusion‐based generative models can learn structured state transitions from unlabeled trajectory data.  

Problem Statement  
We conjecture that pre‐trained diffusion models can serve as “exploration oracles,” guiding an RL agent toward under‐explored yet plausible regions of the state space. By generating diverse, physically coherent future state sequences, diffusion models provide intrinsic reward signals that reflect both novelty and feasibility. This approach effectively trades reliance on sparse extrinsic rewards for abundant unlabeled trajectory data, thus addressing the sample‐efficiency bottleneck in sparse‐reward domains.  

Research Objectives  
1. Develop a framework to pre‐train diffusion models on state trajectories collected from related domains (e.g., random policies, expert demonstrations, video‐based datasets).  
2. Design an RL algorithm that uses the diffusion model at training time to propose “imagined” goal sequences and compute intrinsic rewards for reaching those goals.  
3. Evaluate the resulting Diffusion-Guided Exploration (DGE) method on benchmark sparse‐reward tasks, including robotic manipulation (FetchPushSparse, Maze navigation) and procedurally generated grid environments (MiniGrid).  
4. Compare DGE against state-of-the-art exploration baselines (RND, ICM, DIAYN) in terms of sample efficiency, final performance, and coverage of the state space.  

Significance  
By fusing generative modeling with RL, we aim to:  
• Dramatically reduce the number of environment interactions needed to solve sparse‐reward tasks.  
• Provide a general exploration paradigm that leverages large unlabeled datasets.  
• Offer insights into the use of generative priors for structured decision making, with implications for robotics, autonomous driving, and open‐world agents.  

2. Methodology  
We organize our methodology into five components: data collection, diffusion pre‐training, diffusion‐guided exploration algorithm, integration with RL, and experimental design.  

2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
• Environments: We select a set of related training environments for pre‐training. For robotic manipulation, we use OpenAI Gym’s Fetch environments under random policies. For grid worlds, we sample MiniGrid layouts with random agent actions.  
• Trajectory Dataset \(\mathcal{D}\): We collect \(N\approx 100{,}000\) trajectories of length \(T\) (e.g., \(T=50\) steps) comprised of state vectors \(s_t\in\mathbb{R}^d\) (e.g., joint positions, object positions, or grid‐map encodings).  
• Preprocessing: Each state trajectory \(\tau = (s_1,\dots,s_T)\) is normalized to zero mean and unit variance and stored for diffusion training.  

2.2 Diffusion Model Pre‐Training  
We adopt a standard Gaussian diffusion model on trajectories in state space. The forward (noising) process is:  
$$q(\tau_t \mid \tau_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}\bigl(\tau_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}\,\tau_{t-1},\,\beta_t I\bigr),\quad \beta_t\in(0,1),$$  
for \(t=1,\dots,T\). The reverse (denoising) model \(p_\theta\) is parameterized by a U-Net that takes a noisy trajectory \(\tau_t\) and timestep \(t\), returning a score estimate \(\epsilon_\theta(\tau_t,t)\). The training objective is the standard denoising score matching loss:  
$$\mathcal{L}(\theta)=\mathbb{E}_{\tau\sim\mathcal{D}}\mathbb{E}_{t\sim\mathrm{Uniform}[1,T]}\bigl\|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\tau_t,t)\bigr\|^2,$$  
where \(\epsilon\) is the true Gaussian noise added in the forward process. We train until convergence on held‐out trajectories.  

2.3 Diffusion-Guided Exploration Algorithm  
At RL training time, we use the pre‐trained diffusion model to propose candidate future trajectories and define an intrinsic reward. Our core algorithm is as follows:  

Algorithm 1: Diffusion-Guided Exploration (DGE)  
Input: Pre‐trained diffusion model \(\epsilon_\theta\), policy \(\pi_\phi(a\mid s)\), environment \(\mathcal{E}\), rollout length \(H\), number of samples \(K\), intrinsic reward weight \(\alpha\).  

1. For each training iteration:  
2.  Collect a batch of on-policy transitions \(\{(s_t,a_t)\}\) using \(\pi_\phi\).  
3.  For each visited state \(s_t\):  
4.   Generate \(K\) future trajectory samples \(\{\hat\tau^{(k)}\}_{k=1}^K \sim p_\theta(\cdot\mid s_t)\), where \(\hat\tau^{(k)}=(\hat s_{t+1}^{(k)},\dots,\hat s_{t+H}^{(k)})\).  
5.   Compute a novelty‐weighted selection: choose \(\hat\tau^\ast\) that maximizes a diversity score \(D(\hat\tau^{(k)})\), for example  
6.   $$D(\hat\tau^{(k)})=-\frac{1}{H}\sum_{i=1}^H\log p_\theta(\hat s_{t+i}^{(k)})\quad\text{(lower density → higher novelty)}.$$  
7.   Define intrinsic reward for this step:  
8.   $$r_t^{\mathrm{int}} = \mathbf{1}\bigl\{\|s_{t+h}-\hat s_{t+h}^\ast\|\le\varepsilon\bigr\},\quad h\sim\mathrm{Uniform}[1,H],$$  
9.  End for  
10.  Augment extrinsic reward:  
11.  $$r_t^\prime = r_t^{\mathrm{ext}} + \alpha\,r_t^{\mathrm{int}}.$$  
12.  Update policy \(\pi_\phi\) with PPO (or SAC) on augmented reward \(r_t^\prime\).  
13. End for  

Key components:  
– Sampling diversity score \(D(\cdot)\) ensures the model proposes previously under‐visited regions.  
– The binary indicator in \(r_t^{\mathrm{int}}\) rewards the agent when it reaches a sampled goal state within tolerance \(\varepsilon\).  
– Hyperparameters: \(K\in[5,20]\), \(H\in[5,20]\), \(\alpha\in[0.1,1.0]\), \(\varepsilon\) tuned per environment.  

2.4 Integration with Policy Optimization  
We choose Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for stability in high‐dimensional spaces. The surrogate loss with generalized advantage estimation (GAE) is:  
$$\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{PPO}}(\phi)=\mathbb{E}_{t}\Bigl[\min\bigl(r_t(\phi)\,\hat A_t,\;\mathrm{clip}(r_t(\phi),1-\delta,1+\delta)\,\hat A_t\bigr)\Bigr],$$  
where \(r_t(\phi)=\frac{\pi_\phi(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\phi_{\mathrm{old}}}(a_t|s_t)}\) and \(\hat A_t\) computed on \(r_t^\prime\). We retrain value and policy networks jointly until performance plateaus.  

2.5 Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics  
Environments  
• Robotic manipulation (FetchPushSparse, HandManipulatePenSparse).  
• Procedural grid tasks (MiniGrid MultiRoom‐N7‐S5).  

Baselines  
• PPO + no intrinsic reward (uniform random exploration).  
• PPO + RND intrinsic reward.  
• PPO + ICM intrinsic reward.  
• PPO + DIAYN unsupervised skill learning.  
Ablations  
• DGE without diversity scoring (\(\alpha>0\), but \(D\equiv0\)).  
• DGE with random trajectory proposals.  

Metrics  
1. Sample efficiency: number of environment steps to reach a threshold success rate (e.g., 80%).  
2. Cumulative extrinsic reward over training.  
3. Exploration coverage: fraction of unique states or grid‐cells visited in first \(N\) steps.  
4. Final success rate and mean episode return.  
Statistical Analysis  
We report mean ± standard error over 5 seeds and use nonparametric tests (e.g., Wilcoxon rank‐sum) to verify significance.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
3.1 Improvements in Sample Efficiency  
We expect DGE to achieve target success rates with 30–50% fewer environment interactions than strong exploration baselines (RND, ICM), particularly in long‐horizon sparse‐reward tasks (>50 steps).  

3.2 Enhanced Exploration Coverage  
By leveraging diffusion‐derived novelty metrics, agents should cover 20–40% more of the reachable state space within the same budget, leading to discovery of reward‐bearing states that remain invisible to purely curiosity‐driven agents.  

3.3 Theoretical and Practical Insights  
This research will:  
• Demonstrate how generative priors from diffusion models can be systematically exploited for RL exploration.  
• Provide a modular framework, allowing future extensions (e.g., language‐conditioned diffusion for semantic exploration or physics‐aware diffusion).  
• Offer practical benefits for robotics (e.g., in manipulation, locomotion) and open‐world domains where hand‐crafting exploration bonuses is infeasible.  

3.4 Broader Impacts  
Beyond direct performance gains, DGE paves the way for combining unsupervised generative modeling with decision making in:  
• Autonomous driving: sampling rare traffic scenarios.  
• Scientific discovery: exploring chemical or material design spaces.  
• Human–robot interaction: proposing novel social behaviors.
