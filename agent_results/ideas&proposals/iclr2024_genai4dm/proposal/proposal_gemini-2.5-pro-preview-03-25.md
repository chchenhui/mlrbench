## Diffusion-Guided Exploration (DGE): Enhancing Sample Efficiency in Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning using Pre-trained Generative Models

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Background**
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems. However, a persistent challenge lies in environments with sparse rewards, where agents receive informative feedback only upon reaching rare goal states or completing long sequences of actions correctly. In such scenarios, standard exploration strategies (e.g., epsilon-greedy, random noise) are often inefficient, particularly in high-dimensional state spaces (e.g., vision-based robotics, complex simulations), leading to prohibitive sample complexity. The agent may wander aimlessly for extended periods, failing to discover the behaviors necessary to obtain any reward signal, thus hindering the learning process entirely.

To address this, various intrinsic motivation techniques have been proposed, encouraging exploration based on novelty, curiosity, or prediction error (Pathak et al., 2017; Burda et al., 2018). While effective in certain contexts, these methods can sometimes struggle with stochastic environments or get distracted by irrelevant novelties ("noisy TV problem"). Furthermore, they often lack strong structural priors about the environment's dynamics or the manifold of achievable states, potentially leading to inefficient exploration patterns.

Concurrently, generative models, particularly diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020; Song & Ermon, 2019), have shown extraordinary capabilities in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions across various domains like images, video, and audio. These models learn to capture the underlying structure and variations within large datasets. Their ability to generate high-fidelity, diverse samples suggests they implicitly learn rich representations of the data manifold. Recent works have started exploring the intersection of generative models and decision-making (Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2025), investigating their use as world models, reward generators, policy representations, or for data augmentation (Huang et al., 2023; Janner, 2023; Black et al., 2023; Zhao & Grover, 2023).

This research proposes to leverage the structural understanding inherent in pre-trained diffusion models to explicitly guide exploration in sparse reward RL tasks. The core idea is that a diffusion model, pre-trained on diverse state trajectories (even unlabeled ones from related domains or prior interactions), captures the manifold of *plausible* state sequences within an environment or a class of environments. This learned prior can then be used to generate "imagined," diverse, yet physically plausible future state sequences, serving as targets for novelty-seeking exploration. By intrinsically rewarding the agent for reaching states consistent with these generated plausible futures, we aim to guide exploration towards potentially interesting and reachable regions of the state space, significantly improving sample efficiency compared to undirected exploration or purely state-based novelty methods. This aligns directly with the workshop's themes of exploring how generative model priors can enable sample efficiency and effective exploration, particularly in challenging sparse reward or open-ended tasks. It specifically addresses the question of how pre-trained generative models can help solve long-horizon, sparse reward tasks by providing an informative learning signal beyond the extrinsic reward.

**1.2 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop the Diffusion-Guided Exploration (DGE) framework:** Design and implement a novel exploration strategy for RL agents that utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model to generate plausible future state sequences and provide intrinsic rewards for reaching states consistent with these sequences.
2.  **Investigate the role of pre-training data:** Analyze how the source and diversity of unlabeled trajectory data used for pre-training the diffusion model impact the effectiveness of DGE.
3.  **Quantify the sample efficiency improvement:** Empirically evaluate DGE on challenging benchmark environments with sparse rewards, comparing its performance and sample efficiency against state-of-the-art RL algorithms and exploration strategies.
4.  **Analyze the exploration behavior:** Characterize the qualitative differences in exploration patterns induced by DGE compared to baseline methods, assessing its ability to cover relevant parts of the state space more effectively.

**1.3 Significance**
This research holds significant potential for advancing the field of reinforcement learning and generative AI:

1.  **Addressing a Key RL Challenge:** Sparse rewards and sample inefficiency are major bottlenecks limiting the application of RL to complex real-world problems (robotics, autonomous systems, scientific discovery). DGE offers a principled approach to tackle this challenge by integrating powerful generative priors.
2.  **Novel Application of Diffusion Models:** While diffusion models are increasingly used in RL (Zhu et al., 2023), this work proposes a distinct application focused on *guiding exploration* through generated future states as intrinsic goals, differing from approaches using diffusion for reward learning (Huang et al., 2023), policy representation (Janner, 2023), or direct optimization (Black et al., 2023).
3.  **Bridging Generative AI and Decision Making:** This research directly contributes to the intersection of generative AI and decision making, a key focus of the workshop, by demonstrating how generative models can algorithmically enhance the exploration process in RL.
4.  **Enabling Complex Task Learning:** By improving sample efficiency in sparse reward settings, DGE could enable the learning of complex, long-horizon tasks that are currently intractable with standard methods, particularly in open-ended or procedurally generated environments where defining dense rewards is difficult.
5.  **Leveraging Unlabeled Data:** The framework provides a mechanism to effectively trade potentially large amounts of unlabeled trajectory data (used for pre-training the diffusion model) for efficiency in terms of reward-labeled environment interactions, making RL more practical in data-constrained scenarios.

**2. Methodology**

**2.1 Overall Framework: Diffusion-Guided Exploration (DGE)**
The proposed DGE framework integrates a pre-trained diffusion model with a standard RL algorithm. It operates in two main phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Diffusion Model Pre-training:** A diffusion model is trained on a dataset of state trajectories $\mathcal{D}_{traj} = \{ \tau_i \}$, where each trajectory $\tau = (s_0, s_1, ..., s_T)$ represents a sequence of states. This dataset can consist of unlabeled data from various sources: expert demonstrations, prior successful/unsuccessful runs of other agents, offline datasets from related tasks, or even diverse random exploration data. The goal is for the diffusion model $p_\theta(\tau | c)$ (where $c$ could be an initial state $s_0$ or other context) to learn the distribution of plausible state sequences.

2.  **Phase 2: RL Training with Diffusion-Guided Intrinsic Rewards:** During the standard RL training loop, the agent interacts with the environment. Periodically, or based on certain conditions (e.g., low reward rate), the pre-trained diffusion model is used to generate potential future exploratory targets. The agent receives an intrinsic reward for achieving states that align with these generated targets, complementing the sparse extrinsic reward from the environment. A standard RL algorithm (e.g., SAC, PPO) maximizes the sum of extrinsic and intrinsic rewards.

**2.2 Phase 1: Diffusion Model Pre-training**

*   **Data Collection:** Assemble a dataset $\mathcal{D}_{traj}$ of state trajectories $\tau = (s_0, s_1, ..., s_T)$. State representations $s_t$ can be low-dimensional vectors or high-dimensional observations (e.g., images). The data should ideally capture diverse and physically plausible dynamics relevant to the target task domain(s).
*   **Diffusion Model Architecture:** We will adapt standard diffusion model architectures suitable for sequential data. For instance, a U-Net based architecture (Ronneberger et al., 2015) conditioned on the diffusion timestep $t_{diff}$ and potentially the initial state $s_0$ or a short history $(s_{t-k}, ..., s_t)$. The model, denoted $\epsilon_\theta$, will be trained to predict the noise added to a noised trajectory segment. Let $\tau_{k:k+H} = (s_k, ..., s_{k+H})$ be a trajectory segment. The forward diffusion process gradually adds Gaussian noise:
    $$q(\tau_{k:k+H}^{(t_{diff})} | \tau_{k:k+H}^{(0)}) = \mathcal{N}(\tau_{k:k+H}^{(t_{diff})}; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t_{diff}}} \tau_{k:k+H}^{(0)}, (1-\bar{\alpha}_{t_{diff}})\mathbf{I})$$
    where $\tau_{k:k+H}^{(0)}$ is the original segment, $t_{diff} \in \{1, ..., T_{diff}\}$ is the diffusion timestep, and $\bar{\alpha}_{t_{diff}}$ is a predefined noise schedule.
*   **Training Objective:** The model $\epsilon_\theta$ is trained to denoise the corrupted trajectory segment $\tau_{k:k+H}^{(t_{diff})}$ by predicting the noise $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$. The objective is typically the simplified mean squared error loss:
    $$L_{DM} = \mathbb{E}_{t_{diff}, \tau^{(0)} \sim \mathcal{D}_{traj}, \epsilon} \left\| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\tau^{(t_{diff})}, t_{diff}, c) \right\|^2$$
    where $c$ represents any conditioning information (e.g., initial state $s_k$).

**2.3 Phase 2: RL Training with DGE**

*   **RL Agent:** We will employ a suitable RL algorithm, such as Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) (Haarnoja et al., 2018) for continuous control tasks or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) for broader applicability. The agent's policy $\pi_\phi(a_t | s_t)$ aims to maximize the expected discounted return.
*   **Exploratory Goal Generation:** At certain points during training (e.g., every $N_{goal}$ steps, or when exploration stagnates), use the pre-trained diffusion model $p_\theta$ to generate potential exploratory goals.
    1.  Given the agent's current state $s_t$, sample a batch of $M$ plausible future trajectory segments starting from $s_t$: $\{\hat{\tau}_i | i=1,...,M\}$, where $\hat{\tau}_i = (\hat{s}_{t+1}^i, ..., \hat{s}_{t+H}^i)$, using the reverse diffusion process conditioned on $s_t$. Sampling diversity can be controlled via techniques like classifier-free guidance (Ho & Salimans, 2022) or temperature scaling, potentially guided towards regions dissimilar to recently visited states if needed.
    2.  Select one or more target states $\hat{s}_{goal}$ from these generated trajectories. A simple strategy is to pick the final state $\hat{s}_{t+H}^i$ of a randomly chosen trajectory $\hat{\tau}_i$. More sophisticated strategies could involve selecting states that are predicted to be novel (e.g., low density under a concurrently trained state density model) yet plausible according to the diffusion model.
*   **Intrinsic Reward Calculation:** The agent receives an intrinsic reward $r_{int}$ based on its proximity to the current active goal state $\hat{s}_{goal}$. Let $\phi(\cdot)$ be a state representation function (potentially learned, e.g., from the RL value function or the diffusion model itself). A common form for the intrinsic reward at step $t'$ when pursuing goal $\hat{s}_{goal}$ generated at step $t$ is:
    $$r_{int}(s_{t'}) = \beta \exp(-\alpha \| \phi(s_{t'}) - \phi(\hat{s}_{goal}) \|_2^2)$$
    where $\alpha > 0$ controls the precision of the goal matching, and $\beta > 0$ is a scaling factor balancing intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. The goal $\hat{s}_{goal}$ remains active for a fixed horizon or until reached (or deemed unreachable).
*   **Combined Reward:** The RL agent learns using the combined reward signal:
    $$r_{total}(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) = r_{ext}(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) + r_{int}(s_{t+1})$$
*   **Overall Algorithm:**

    1.  **Pre-train:** Train the diffusion model $p_\theta$ on $\mathcal{D}_{traj}$.
    2.  **Initialize:** Initialize RL policy $\pi_\phi$, value function(s) $Q_\psi$, replay buffer $\mathcal{B}$.
    3.  **Loop:** For each training episode/step:
        a.  If it's time to generate a new goal (or current goal achieved/expired):
            i. Sample $\{\hat{\tau}_i\}_{i=1}^M \sim p_\theta(\cdot | s_t)$.
            ii. Select $\hat{s}_{goal}$ from the sampled trajectories.
        b.  Observe state $s_t$.
        c.  Select action $a_t \sim \pi_\phi(a_t | s_t)$.
        d.  Execute $a_t$, observe next state $s_{t+1}$ and extrinsic reward $r_{ext}$.
        e.  Calculate intrinsic reward $r_{int}(s_{t+1})$ based on $\hat{s}_{goal}$.
        f.  Calculate total reward $r_{total} = r_{ext} + r_{int}$.
        g.  Store transition $(s_t, a_t, r_{total}, s_{t+1})$ in $\mathcal{B}$.
        h.  Sample minibatch from $\mathcal{B}$ and update $\pi_\phi, Q_\psi$ using the RL algorithm's update rules (e.g., SAC or PPO updates) targeting the maximization of $\mathbb{E}[\sum \gamma^k r_{total}]$.

**2.4 Experimental Design**

*   **Environments:** We will evaluate DGE on benchmarks known for challenging exploration due to sparse rewards and/or high-dimensional state spaces:
    *   **Robotic Manipulation:** Tasks from the Meta-World suite (Yu et al., 2019) or Fetch benchmarks (Plappert et al., 2018) with sparse reward settings (e.g., Pick-and-Place, Push). State representation will include robot joint angles and object positions, potentially extending to image-based inputs.
    *   **Procedurally Generated Environments:** Mazes or navigation tasks from MiniGrid (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018) or ProcGen Benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2019) with sparse rewards and long horizons, testing generalization across different environment layouts.
    *   **(Optional) Complex Continuous Control:** Locomotion or manipulation tasks in DeepMind Control Suite (Tassa et al., 2018) with sparse goal conditions.
*   **Pre-training Data:** We will investigate different sources for $\mathcal{D}_{traj}$:
    *   Data from unrelated tasks within the same simulator (e.g., trajectories from all Meta-World tasks).
    *   Data from purely random exploration policies.
    *   (If available) Expert demonstrations for related tasks.
*   **Baselines:** We will compare DGE against:
    *   **Standard RL:** SAC/PPO with standard exploration (e.g., Gaussian noise for SAC, entropy bonus for PPO) applied directly to the sparse extrinsic reward.
    *   **Novelty-Based Exploration:** SAC/PPO combined with established intrinsic motivation methods like Random Network Distillation (RND) (Burda et al., 2018) or Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM) (Pathak et al., 2017).
    *   **(Optional) Goal-Conditioned RL:** Standard Goal-Conditioned RL methods (e.g., Hindsight Experience Replay - HER) if applicable to the environment structure.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Sample Efficiency:** Learning curves plotting task success rate or average episode return against the number of environment steps/interactions. We expect DGE to achieve higher performance faster (steeper curve, higher asymptote within a fixed interaction budget).
    *   **Final Performance:** Maximum average success rate or episode return achieved after convergence or a large number of steps.
    *   **Exploration Coverage:** Metrics to quantify the extent of state space exploration, such as the number of unique states visited (discretized if necessary) or entropy of the visited state distribution.
    *   **Computational Cost:** Training time and computational resources required for DGE compared to baselines.

**3. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**3.1 Expected Outcomes**

1.  **Demonstration of DGE Efficacy:** We expect DGE to significantly outperform baseline methods (standard RL, RND, ICM) in terms of sample efficiency and final performance on the selected sparse reward benchmark tasks. The diffusion model's prior should effectively guide exploration towards relevant state space regions.
2.  **Successful Learning in Challenging Tasks:** We anticipate DGE enabling successful policy learning in complex, long-horizon tasks where baseline methods completely fail to find the sparse reward signal within a reasonable interaction budget.
3.  **Quantified Benefits of Pre-training:** The experiments will quantify how different types and amounts of pre-training data affect DGE's performance, providing insights into the data requirements for leveraging generative priors effectively. We hypothesize that more diverse and domain-relevant pre-training data will yield better results.
4.  **Qualitative Insights into Exploration:** Analysis of agent trajectories and state visitation patterns will illustrate how DGE promotes structured and directed exploration compared to the more random or locally-focused exploration of baselines.
5.  **A Robust and Well-Documented Framework:** The research will produce a well-defined DGE algorithm, implementations for chosen benchmarks, and thorough empirical results, contributing a valuable tool to the RL community.

**3.2 Impact**

This research aims to make several impactful contributions:

*   **Methodological Advancement in RL:** DGE represents a novel approach to exploration by synergizing deep generative models (diffusion) with intrinsic motivation, potentially setting a new direction for tackling sample inefficiency in RL.
*   **Expanding the Role of Generative Models in Decision Making:** It showcases a new way generative models can be integrated into the RL loop—not just as world models or policy networks, but as active guides for exploration, directly addressing a core theme of the workshop. By using the generative model to provide an "informative learning signal" based on plausibility, it directly answers the workshop's tentative research question on how generative models can help solve sparse reward tasks.
*   **Practical Implications:** By significantly reducing the sample complexity for learning in sparse reward settings, DGE could make RL more viable for real-world applications like robotic skill acquisition, complex system control, and drug discovery, where interactions are expensive or time-consuming.
*   **Foundation for Future Work:** This work could inspire further research into using various generative models for structured exploration, goal generation in hierarchical RL, or transfer learning by pre-training diffusion models on diverse environments. It also opens questions about optimally combining generative priors with other exploration techniques.

In summary, the proposed Diffusion-Guided Exploration (DGE) framework offers a promising path towards overcoming the critical challenge of exploration in sparse reward environments. By leveraging the power of pre-trained diffusion models to understand and generate plausible state sequences, DGE aims to dramatically improve sample efficiency, enabling the application of RL to a wider range of complex, real-world decision-making problems. This research aligns perfectly with the goals of fostering collaboration and exploring new methodologies at the intersection of generative AI and decision making.
