# Diffusion-Guided Exploration for Sparse Reward Tasks: Leveraging Pre-Trainined Generative Models to Improve Decision Making  

## Introduction  

### Background  
Decision-making agents operating in environments with sparse feedback face significant challenges due to the lack of dense supervisory signals. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle to effectively explore high-dimensional state spaces and long-horizon tasks when rewards occur infrequently. In robotics and autonomous systems, where physical interactions are costly and time-consuming, this problem becomes critical. Recent advancements in diffusion models—a class of generative models capable of producing high-fidelity samples with realistic structures—offer a promising avenue to address these limitations. Diffusion models excel at learning data distributions from unlabelled data and can generate diverse, physically plausible state sequences, making them ideal candidates for guiding exploration in sparse reward settings.  

### Research Objectives  
This research proposes to develop a **diffusion-guided exploration framework** that:  
1. **Leverages pre-trained diffusion models** to learn the manifold of plausible state sequences from unlabelled data in related domains.  
2. **Generates novel, diverse trajectories** during agent training to guide exploration toward uncharted but structurally meaningful regions of the state space.  
3. **Quantifies intrinsic rewards** based on alignment with the diffusion model’s generative capabilities to incentivize agents to pursue these novel trajectories.  
4. **Demonstrates improved sample efficiency and performance** over existing exploration strategies in benchmark robotic tasks with sparse rewards.  

### Significance  
The proposed approach directly addresses two critical challenges in decision-making: (1) exploration in sparse reward environments and (2) sample efficiency in data-constrained settings. By integrating pre-trained diffusion models as exploration guides, this work could:  
- Reduce the reliance on dense reward signals, enabling agents to learn effectively in high-dimensional, open-ended environments.  
- Transfer structural priors from related domains (e.g., physical simulations or video datasets) to accelerate learning in target tasks.  
- Broaden the applicability of RL algorithms in real-world robotics, gaming, and sequential decision-making systems.

## Methodology  

### Research Design  

#### Dual-Phase Exploration System  
The methodology consists of two phases:  

**Phase 1: Pre-training the Diffusion Model**  
A diffusion model $ \mathcal{D} $ is trained on a dataset $ \mathcal{S} = \{\tau_1, \tau_2, \dots, \tau_N\} $, where each trajectory $ \tau_i = \{(s_0^i, a_0^i), (s_1^i, a_1^i), \dots, (s_T^i, a_T^i)\} $ represents a sequence of states $ s_t $ and actions $ a_t $ from environments related to the target task. The diffusion model learns to reverse a Markovian forward process of corruption, mapping noisy states back to the data-generating distribution. The training objective is to minimize the variational bound on the negative log-likelihood of trajectories:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{diff}} = \mathbb{E}_{s_0 \sim q(s_0), t \sim \mathcal{U}(1,\dots,T)}\left[\| \varepsilon(s_t) - \varepsilon_\theta(s_t, t) \|^2\right],
$$  
where $ \varepsilon(s_t) $ is the ground truth noise at step $ t $, $ \varepsilon_\theta $ is the neural network approximator parameterized by $ \theta $, and $ s_t $ is a corrupted state at time $ t $.  

**Phase 2: Diffusion-Guided Exploration in Decision-Making**  
During agent training, the pre-trained diffusion model $ \mathcal{D} $ generates synthetic trajectories $ \hat{\tau} $ to guide exploration. The agent receives intrinsic rewards based on how closely its trajectory $ \tau $ matches $ \hat{\tau} $.  

### Algorithmic Components  

#### 1. Diffusion-Based Novelty Measure  
For each time step $ t $, the agent observes state $ s_t $. The diffusion model generates a "target" sequence $ \hat{\tau}_t = \{\hat{s}_{t+1}, \hat{s}_{t+2}, \dots, \hat{s}_{t+K}\} $ using the current state $ s_t $ as input:  
$$
\hat{\tau}_t \sim \mathcal{D}(s_t; \phi),
$$  
where $ \phi $ represents stochastic sampling parameters. The intrinsic reward $ r_{\text{intrinsic}} $ is computed as the negative cosine distance between $ s_{t+k} $ and $ \hat{s}_{t+k} $ over the forecast horizon $ K $:  
$$
r_{\text{intrinsic}}(s_{t+1}, s_{t+2}, \dots, s_{t+K}) = -\sum_{k=1}^K \left(1 - \frac{s_{t+k} \cdot \hat{s}_{t+k}}{\|s_{t+k}\| \|\hat{s}_{t+k}\|} \right).
$$  
This reward incentivizes the agent to reach states $ s_{t+k} $ that align with the diffusion model’s plausible sequences.  

#### 2. Policy Optimization  
The agent’s policy $ \pi_\theta $ is trained using a standard RL algorithm (e.g., SAC or PPO) augmented with the intrinsic reward:  
$$
R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{extrinsic}} + \lambda \cdot r_{\text{intrinsic}},
$$  
where $ \lambda $ controls the weight of the intrinsic reward.

2. **Diverse Exploration**: Diffusion-guided agents will visit 20–40% more unique states per episode compared to RND.  
3. **Generalization Across Domains**: Pre-trained diffusion models from physics simulations (e.g., MuJoCo) will enable non-trivial transfer to real-world robotic tasks with no fine-tuning.

### Challenges & Mitigation  
1. **Computational Complexity**: Training diffusion models on large-scale datasets may require 1TB+ of video data. Mitigation: Use of distilled or lightweight diffusion models (e.g., DDIM) and distributed training.  
2. **Distribution Shift**: Diffusion models trained on unrelated domains may generate physically impossible trajectories. Mitigation: Fine-tuning with early exploration data using Bayesian adaptation techniques.  

This research promises to redefine the role of generative models in decision-making, offering a scalable and practical solution to one of RL’s most enduring challenges. By directly trading labeled reward data for abundant unlabeled environmental data, it paves the way for agents that learn faster, generalize better, and adapt more flexibly to new tasks.
