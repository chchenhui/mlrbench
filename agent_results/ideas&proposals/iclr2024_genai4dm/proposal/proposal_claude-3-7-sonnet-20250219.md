# Harnessing Diffusion Models for Novelty-Guided Exploration in Sparse Reward Environments

## 1. Introduction

Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems, from playing games to controlling robotic systems. However, a persistent challenge in RL is handling sparse reward environments, where feedback signals are provided only after completing specific tasks or reaching particular states. In such environments, traditional exploration strategies often fail to efficiently discover successful behaviors, leading to poor sample efficiency and limiting the applicability of RL to many real-world problems.

The exploration-exploitation dilemma represents a fundamental challenge in RL, with classic approaches such as Îµ-greedy, Boltzmann exploration, and upper confidence bound methods providing limited effectiveness in high-dimensional state spaces with sparse rewards. More recent approaches, including count-based methods (Bellemare et al., 2016), curiosity-driven exploration (Pathak et al., 2017), and random network distillation (Burda et al., 2018), have improved exploration capabilities but still struggle with the complexity of modern environments, especially those with visual observations and long-horizon tasks.

Meanwhile, diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of capturing complex data distributions across various domains. These models learn to reverse a gradual noising process, allowing them to generate high-quality samples from random noise. Their ability to capture the underlying structure of environments without requiring explicit reward signals makes them particularly promising for guiding exploration in RL.

Recent work has begun exploring the integration of diffusion models with reinforcement learning. For instance, Huang et al. (2023) proposed Diffusion Reward for learning rewards from expert videos, while Black et al. (2023) introduced denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) for optimizing diffusion models with reinforcement learning. Tianci et al. (2024) demonstrated improvements in sample efficiency by integrating diffusion models with PPO. However, the specific application of diffusion models as exploration guides in sparse reward settings remains largely unexplored.

This research proposes a novel framework called Diffusion-Guided Exploration (DGE) that leverages pre-trained diffusion models to generate novelty-seeking exploratory behaviors in sparse reward environments. The approach consists of a dual-phase system: (1) a diffusion model pre-trained on state trajectories from related domains learns the manifold of plausible state sequences, and (2) during training, the model guides exploration by generating "imagined" novel state sequences that are both diverse and physically plausible, providing intrinsic rewards for the agent.

Our research objectives are three-fold:
1. Develop a framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion models to guide exploration in sparse reward environments
2. Design an intrinsic reward mechanism based on the alignment between the agent's current state and the diffusion-generated sequences
3. Evaluate the approach's effectiveness across a variety of complex environments, including robotics manipulation tasks and procedurally generated environments

The significance of this research lies in its potential to dramatically reduce the sample complexity of learning in sparse reward environments by introducing structural priors from visual dynamics models. By effectively trading labeled reward data for unlabeled environmental data, our approach could enable more efficient learning in complex, open-ended tasks where traditional exploration techniques fall short.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Overview

The proposed Diffusion-Guided Exploration (DGE) framework consists of two main components: (1) a diffusion model pre-trained on state trajectories, and (2) an RL agent that uses the diffusion model for guided exploration. Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of our approach.

### 2.2 Diffusion Model for State Trajectory Generation

#### 2.2.1 Preliminary: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models

Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) (Ho et al., 2020) are latent variable models that gradually convert a noise distribution into a data distribution through an iterative denoising process. The forward diffusion process gradually adds Gaussian noise to the data across $T$ time steps according to a variance schedule $\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_T$:

$$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \beta_t\mathbf{I})$$

where $x_0$ is the initial data sample, and $x_t$ is the sample at time step $t$. The reverse process then learns to denoise the sample:

$$p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t))$$

where $\mu_\theta$ and $\Sigma_\theta$ are learned by a neural network.

#### 2.2.2 State Trajectory Diffusion Model

We adapt the diffusion model to operate on state trajectories rather than individual states. Given a dataset of state trajectories $\mathcal{D} = \{\tau_i\}_{i=1}^N$ where each trajectory $\tau_i = (s_0^i, s_1^i, ..., s_H^i)$ consists of $H$ consecutive states, we train a diffusion model to learn the distribution of plausible trajectories.

For visual state spaces, we encode each state using a convolutional encoder $E: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ to obtain a latent representation. The diffusion model then operates on these latent trajectories $\hat{\tau}_i = (E(s_0^i), E(s_1^i), ..., E(s_H^i))$.

The training objective for the trajectory diffusion model is to minimize:

$$L_{diffusion} = \mathbb{E}_{t \sim [1,T], \hat{\tau} \sim \mathcal{D}, \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I})} \left[ \|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\hat{\tau}_t, t)\|^2 \right]$$

where $\hat{\tau}_t$ is the noised trajectory at diffusion step $t$, and $\epsilon_\theta$ is the noise prediction network.

#### 2.2.3 Conditional Trajectory Generation

To guide exploration effectively, we condition the diffusion model on the agent's current state $s_t$ to generate plausible future state sequences. The conditional generation process is formulated as:

$$p_\theta(\hat{\tau}_{0:H}|s_t) = p_\theta(\hat{\tau}_T) \prod_{t=T}^{1} p_\theta(\hat{\tau}_{t-1}|\hat{\tau}_t, s_t)$$

where $\hat{\tau}_{0:H}$ represents a generated trajectory starting from the current state $s_t$.

We implement this conditional generation using classifier-free guidance (Ho & Salimans, 2022) by training the diffusion model to predict both unconditional noise $\epsilon_\theta(\hat{\tau}_t, t)$ and conditional noise $\epsilon_\theta(\hat{\tau}_t, t, s_t)$.

### 2.3 Diffusion-Guided Exploration

#### 2.3.1 Intrinsic Reward Formulation

We define an intrinsic reward function based on the alignment between the agent's actual state and the diffusion-generated trajectories. Given the agent's current state $s_t$ and a set of $K$ generated trajectories $\{\hat{\tau}^k\}_{k=1}^K$, the intrinsic reward is computed as:

$$r_{intrinsic}(s_t, s_{t+1}) = \max_{k \in [1,K]} \text{sim}(s_{t+1}, \hat{\tau}^k_{t+1})$$

where $\text{sim}(s, s')$ measures the similarity between states. For visual states, we use the cosine similarity between their latent representations:

$$\text{sim}(s, s') = \frac{E(s) \cdot E(s')}{\|E(s)\| \cdot \|E(s')\|}$$

Additionally, we incorporate a novelty term to encourage exploration of previously unvisited states:

$$r_{novelty}(s_{t+1}) = \alpha \cdot (1 - \max_{s \in \mathcal{M}} \text{sim}(s_{t+1}, s))$$

where $\mathcal{M}$ is a buffer of recently visited states, and $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter controlling the novelty weight.

The total reward for the agent is a combination of the extrinsic reward from the environment and our intrinsic rewards:

$$r_{total}(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) = r_{extrinsic}(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) + \lambda_1 \cdot r_{intrinsic}(s_t, s_{t+1}) + \lambda_2 \cdot r_{novelty}(s_{t+1})$$

where $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are hyperparameters controlling the contribution of each reward component.

#### 2.3.2 Trajectory Diversity via Determinantal Point Processes

To ensure diverse exploration, we sample diverse trajectories from the diffusion model using Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs). Given a kernel matrix $\mathbf{L}$ where $L_{ij} = K(E(\hat{\tau}^i), E(\hat{\tau}^j))$ represents the similarity between trajectories, the probability of selecting a subset $S$ of trajectories is:

$$P(S) \propto \det(\mathbf{L}_S)$$

where $\mathbf{L}_S$ is the submatrix of $\mathbf{L}$ indexed by elements in $S$. This formulation naturally encourages diversity in the selected trajectories.

### 2.4 Algorithm

Our complete Diffusion-Guided Exploration (DGE) algorithm is presented below:

1. **Pre-training Phase:**
   - Collect a dataset of state trajectories $\mathcal{D} = \{\tau_i\}_{i=1}^N$ from related domains
   - Train a diffusion model $p_\theta$ on the trajectory dataset to learn $p_\theta(\hat{\tau}_{0:H}|s_t)$

2. **Exploration Phase:**
   - Initialize RL agent policy $\pi_\phi$, replay buffer $\mathcal{B}$, and visited states buffer $\mathcal{M}$
   - For each episode:
     - Reset environment to initial state $s_0$
     - For each time step $t$:
       - Generate $K$ diverse trajectories $\{\hat{\tau}^k\}_{k=1}^K$ conditioned on $s_t$ using DPP sampling
       - Select action $a_t \sim \pi_\phi(a_t|s_t)$
       - Execute action, observe next state $s_{t+1}$ and extrinsic reward $r_{extrinsic}$
       - Compute intrinsic reward $r_{intrinsic}(s_t, s_{t+1})$
       - Compute novelty reward $r_{novelty}(s_{t+1})$
       - Compute total reward $r_{total}$
       - Store transition $(s_t, a_t, r_{total}, s_{t+1})$ in $\mathcal{B}$
       - Update visited states buffer $\mathcal{M}$
     - Update policy $\pi_\phi$ using any RL algorithm (e.g., PPO, SAC) with transitions from $\mathcal{B}$

### 2.5 Experimental Design

#### 2.5.1 Environments

We evaluate our approach on three categories of environments:

1. **Robotics Manipulation Tasks:**
   - **Fetch Reach-v1**: The agent controls a robotic arm to reach a target position.
   - **Fetch Push-v1**: The agent needs to push an object to a target location.
   - **Fetch Pick-and-Place-v1**: The agent must pick up an object and place it at a target location.

2. **Procedurally Generated Environments:**
   - **MiniGrid-Empty-16x16-v0**: A simple grid world where the agent must navigate to a goal.
   - **MiniGrid-FourRooms-v0**: A more complex grid world with four rooms connected by narrow corridors.
   - **MiniGrid-KeyCorridorS3R3-v0**: The agent must find a key to unlock a door to reach the goal.

3. **High-Dimensional Visual Environments:**
   - **DeepMind Control Suite**: We use Cheetah Run, Walker Walk, and Cartpole Swingup tasks.
   - **Atari Games**: We select sparse reward games like Montezuma's Revenge and Pitfall.

For each environment, we create sparse reward versions by only providing a reward upon task completion.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### 3.1 Expected Outcomes

1. **Improved Sample Efficiency:**
   We expect DGE to significantly reduce the number of environment interactions required to learn successful policies in sparse reward settings, potentially by an order of magnitude compared to traditional exploration methods. This improvement will be particularly pronounced in complex environments with high-dimensional state spaces and long-horizon tasks.

2. **Enhanced Exploration Capabilities:**
   DGE should demonstrate superior state coverage and more consistent discovery of rare but rewarding states compared to baseline methods. The diversity of exploration paths generated by the diffusion model will enable the agent to systematically explore the environment rather than wandering randomly.

3. **Generalization Across Tasks:**
   We anticipate that the pre-trained diffusion model will transfer effectively across related tasks within the same domain, allowing for rapid adaptation to new environments with minimal additional training. This transferability will be evaluated by pre-training on a subset of tasks and testing on unseen variations.

4. **Scalability to Complex Environments:**
   Our approach should scale well to complex visual environments where traditional exploration methods struggle. The diffusion model's ability to capture the structure of the environment from unlabeled data will provide valuable guidance even in high-dimensional state spaces.

5. **New Insights into the Relationship Between Generative Models and Exploration:**
   This research will provide valuable insights into how generative models can be leveraged for exploration in RL, potentially opening new research directions at the intersection of these fields.

### 3.2 Impact

1. **Theoretical Implications:**
   This work bridges the gap between generative modeling and reinforcement learning, providing a framework for using learned world models to guide exploration. It demonstrates how unlabeled data can be leveraged to improve sample efficiency in reward-constrained settings, potentially influencing theoretical perspectives on the exploration-exploitation dilemma.

2. **Practical Applications:**
   The improved sample efficiency offered by our approach could make RL practical for a wider range of real-world applications, including:
   - Robotic control in complex environments
   - Autonomous navigation in novel terrains
   - Game AI for complex strategy games
   - Resource management in dynamic systems

3. **Future Research Directions:**
   This work opens several promising research directions:
   - Extending the approach to multi-agent settings
   - Incorporating human feedback into the diffusion guidance process
   - Developing theoretical guarantees for exploration efficiency
   - Applying the method to real-world robotic systems

4. **Broader Impact:**
   By reducing the data requirements for RL, our approach contributes to more sustainable AI development with lower computational costs. This could democratize access to effective RL solutions by making them viable with more modest computing resources.

In summary, Diffusion-Guided Exploration represents a significant step forward in addressing the challenge of exploration in sparse reward environments. By leveraging the power of diffusion models to provide structured guidance for exploration, our approach has the potential to substantially improve the applicability of reinforcement learning to complex real-world problems. The ability to trade labeled reward data for unlabeled environmental data opens new possibilities for sample-efficient learning in settings where designing dense reward functions is challenging or impractical.
