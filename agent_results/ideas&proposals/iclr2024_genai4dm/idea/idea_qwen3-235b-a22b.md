**Title:** Physics-Aware Diffusion Models for Sample-Efficient Robotic Planning  

**Motivation:**  
Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with sample efficiency and generalization in complex environments due to inaccurate or brittle world models. Diffusion models, with their ability to generate high-fidelity, diverse samples, offer a promising avenue to address these challenges. However, existing diffusion models lack explicit integration of physical laws, limiting their utility in decision-making tasks requiring precise dynamics prediction (e.g., robotics). Developing physics-aware generative models could bridge this gap, enabling agents to simulate realistic transitions and plan effectively with minimal real-world interaction.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose **Physics-Informed Diffusion Dynamics (PIDD)**, a framework that integrates physical constraints into diffusion models for robotic control. During training, the model learns to denoise trajectories while minimizing a physics-consistency loss (e.g., Newtonian dynamics, collision constraints). For decision making, the diffusion model acts as a world simulator, generating synthetic state-action transitions conditioned on task-specific priors (e.g., object mass, friction). These transitions are used to pre-train an RL policy or perform model-predictive planning. We evaluate PIDD on robotic manipulation and navigation tasks, measuring sample efficiency gains against traditional model-based RL baselines. Expected outcomes include a 50% reduction in real-world data requirements and improved zero-shot generalization to novel physics (e.g., unseen object weights). This work could enable safer, faster learning in high-stakes domains like autonomous driving and industrial robotics, where accurate physics modeling is critical.
