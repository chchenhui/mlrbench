**Title:** Diffusion World Models for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning  

**Motivation:** Reinforcement learning (RL) often struggles with sample inefficiency, requiring extensive environmental interactions to learn robust policies. This limits its applicability in real-world settings such as robotics, where data collection is costly. Generative models, particularly diffusion models, excel at modeling high-dimensional data distributions and could encode rich priors about physical dynamics from diverse video data. Leveraging these priors to build predictive world models offers a pathway to drastically reduce the training samples needed for RL.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes training a diffusion-based world model on large-scale, unlabeled video datasets spanning diverse environments (e.g., robotics simulations, real-world footage) to learn implicit physics and dynamics. The model would predict plausible future states and rewards conditioned on actions, serving as a drop-in replacement for traditional world models in model-based RL. During policy training, agents would plan using this pre-trained diffusion model via iterative denoising to simulate trajectories, enabling efficient exploration and policy updates with minimal environmental interaction. Experiments would measure sample efficiency gains on sparse-reward robotic manipulation and navigation tasks, comparing against pixel-based model-free RL and non-diffusion world models. Success would demonstrate how generative priors enable RL agents to generalize across tasks with fewer samples, accelerating real-world deployment.
