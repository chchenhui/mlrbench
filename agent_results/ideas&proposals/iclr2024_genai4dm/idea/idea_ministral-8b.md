### Title: Enhancing Decision Making with Generative Models: A Focus on Sample Efficiency

### Motivation
The integration of generative models with decision-making algorithms holds great promise for improving sample efficiency in complex, data-constrained environments. Current decision-making methods often struggle with high sample requirements, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. By leveraging generative models, we can introduce priors from related domains, thereby reducing the need for extensive labeled data and speeding up the learning process.

### Main Idea
The proposed research idea focuses on enhancing sample efficiency in decision-making algorithms by incorporating generative models. The methodology involves using pre-trained generative models, such as large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, to introduce domain-specific priors into decision-making tasks. This approach can significantly improve the sample efficiency of tabula rasa training by leveraging unlabelled samples and reducing the dependency on reward-labeled data.

Expected outcomes include:
1. **Improved Sample Efficiency:** Demonstrating that generative models can effectively trade reward-labeled efficiency for unlabelled samples, enabling faster learning on complex decision-making tasks.
2. **Enhanced Exploration Strategies:** Utilizing generative models to facilitate exploration strategies in high-dimensional and sparse reward settings, helping decision-making agents solve long-horizon tasks without a clear definition of success.
3. **Transfer Learning:** Investigating how generative models can aid transfer learning in decision-making, allowing agents to adapt to new tasks more efficiently through a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamical systems.

Potential impact:
- **Real-World Applications:** The proposed approach can be applied to various domains, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare, where data is often scarce or expensive to obtain.
- **Research Community:** This research will contribute to the broader understanding of how generative models can be integrated with decision-making algorithms, fostering collaborations between these two fields.
- **Methodological Advancements:** The findings will provide new methodologies and evaluation criteria for assessing the utility of generative models in decision-making, paving the way for future research and applications.
