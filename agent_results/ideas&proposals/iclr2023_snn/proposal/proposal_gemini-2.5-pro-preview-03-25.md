**1. Title:**

Adaptive Compute Fabric: A Hardware-Software Co-Design Approach for Accelerated and Sustainable Sparse Neural Network Training

**2. Introduction**

*   **Background:** Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized numerous fields, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex tasks ranging from computer vision and natural language processing to scientific discovery. This success, however, has been largely driven by scaling models to billions, sometimes trillions, of parameters, trained on massive datasets. This scaling trajectory imposes significant computational and energy costs. Training these large models requires vast, specialized hardware infrastructures (typically GPU clusters) that consume enormous amounts of energy, contributing substantially to the carbon footprint of AI development and deployment. Furthermore, the rapid obsolescence cycle of hardware adds to the growing problem of electronic waste. This trend raises critical concerns about the sustainability and accessibility of cutting-edge AI research and applications. Sparsity, the property that many parameters (weights) or activations in a trained or training DNN can be zero without significant loss of accuracy, offers a promising avenue to mitigate these costs. By performing computations only on non-zero elements, sparse networks theoretically require fewer operations and less memory bandwidth, leading to potential improvements in speed and energy efficiency. However, realizing these theoretical gains in practice, especially during the computationally intensive training phase, remains a major challenge. Current hardware, notably GPUs, is heavily optimized for dense, regular computations and struggles to efficiently handle the irregular memory access patterns and conditional computations inherent in sparse operations. This mismatch often negates the potential benefits of sparsity, leading to limited practical speedups or even slowdowns compared to dense training on the same hardware.

*   **Research Gap and Motivation:** The literature highlights significant efforts in developing sparse training algorithms (*e.g.*, dynamic sparsity [10], neuroregeneration [6], learnable sparsity [9]) and specialized hardware accelerators for *inference* or specific sparse patterns (*e.g.*, tile-wise sparsity [3], SparseRT for inference [4], Sparse-Winograd [5]). Some works like Procrustes [1] and TensorDash [2] specifically target accelerating sparse *training*, demonstrating promising results by tailoring dataflows and hardware units. However, a key challenge remains: efficiently handling the *dynamic and varying* nature of sparsity patterns that evolve *during* the training process, while tightly coupling the algorithm's sparsity strategy with the underlying hardware capabilities. Existing hardware often lacks the flexibility to adapt its compute and data movement strategies optimally as sparsity patterns change, and many sparse training algorithms are designed without explicit consideration for hardware amenability beyond standard sparse formats. This research is motivated by the need for a holistic hardware-software co-design approach that specifically targets the challenges of *sparse training*. We hypothesize that a compute fabric capable of dynamically adapting its operation based on runtime sparsity characteristics, designed in tandem with sparsity-inducing training algorithms, can unlock significant performance and energy efficiency gains currently unrealized on conventional hardware.

*   **Proposed Solution:** We propose the design, simulation, and evaluation of an **Adaptive Compute Fabric (ACF)**, a novel hardware architecture specifically architected for accelerating sparse DNN training. The core idea is a **hardware-software co-design** methodology. The ACF hardware will feature:
    1.  **Adaptive Compute Units:** Processing elements (PEs) capable of dynamically detecting and bypassing multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations involving zero-valued weights or activations, thus saving computation cycles and energy.
    2.  **Sparse-Aware Memory Subsystem:** Hierarchical memory controllers optimized for fetching non-zero weights and activations efficiently using compressed sparse formats (e.g., Compressed Sparse Row/Column - CSR/CSC, or variations) and associated indices, minimizing memory bandwidth bottlenecks.
    3.  **Reconfigurable Interconnect:** A flexible on-chip network allowing dataflow patterns to be dynamically configured to match the prevailing sparsity structure (e.g., optimizing communication paths based on the distribution of non-zero elements), improving data locality and reducing communication overhead.
    The software component involves developing and adapting sparse training algorithms (e.g., dynamic structured/unstructured pruning, gradual pruning) that are cognizant of the ACF's capabilities. This includes choosing sparsity representations, pruning granularities, and potential structured sparsity patterns that maximize the utilization and efficiency of the ACF's adaptive units, memory system, and interconnect.

*   **Research Objectives:**
    1.  To design the detailed microarchitecture of the Adaptive Compute Fabric (ACF), including its adaptive compute units, sparse-aware memory hierarchy, and reconfigurable interconnect.
    2.  To develop hardware-aware sparse training algorithms and strategies (pruning methods, sparsity representations) that are co-designed to leverage the ACF architecture effectively.
    3.  To implement a cycle-accurate simulation framework for the ACF and integrate it with a deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) to enable co-simulation of the hardware and sparse training algorithms.
    4.  To conduct comprehensive experiments evaluating the performance (training speedup), energy efficiency, and scalability of the ACF approach compared to state-of-the-art GPU baselines for sparse and dense training across various DNN models and datasets.
    5.  To analyze the trade-offs between model sparsity, accuracy, training time, and energy consumption facilitated by the ACF.

*   **Significance:** This research directly addresses the critical challenges of computational sustainability and efficiency in deep learning, aligning with the workshop's focus. By demonstrating substantial improvements in sparse training speed and energy efficiency, the ACF could:
    1.  **Reduce the environmental impact** of training large-scale AI models.
    2.  **Lower the barrier to entry** for cutting-edge AI research by reducing hardware costs.
    3.  **Enable the training of even larger and more complex models** within practical time and energy budgets.
    4.  **Advance the field of hardware-software co-design** for domain-specific acceleration, providing insights for future hardware architectures beyond GPUs.
    5.  Provide concrete data on the **trade-offs between sparsity, performance, efficiency, and accuracy** when hardware is explicitly designed for sparse operations.

**3. Methodology**

Our research methodology follows a phased approach, integrating hardware design, algorithm development, simulation, and rigorous evaluation.

*   **Phase 1: ACF Architecture Design (Months 1-6)**
    *   **Compute Unit Design:** We will design Processing Elements (PEs) based on multiply-accumulate (MAC) units. The key innovation will be the integration of zero-detection logic for both weight and activation inputs. If either input is zero, the multiplication and accumulation can be skipped (clock-gated or bypassed). We will explore different granularities for this skipping (e.g., individual MACs, vector units). Let $W$ be the weight matrix, $A$ be the activation matrix, and $O$ be the output matrix. A standard dense matrix multiplication performs $O_{ik} = \sum_j W_{ij} A_{jk}$. In the ACF, the computation for a specific output element $O_{ik}$ within a PE cluster would effectively be:
        $$
        O_{ik} = \sum_{j \in \text{NZ}(W_{i,:}) \cap \text{NZ}(A_{:,k})} W_{ij} A_{jk}
        $$
        where $\text{NZ}(\cdot)$ denotes the set of indices of non-zero elements. The hardware logic will implement this conditional summation efficiently.
    *   **Memory Subsystem Design:** We will design a hierarchical memory system with specialized controllers. These controllers will directly handle sparse data formats (e.g., CSR/CSC). For CSR format, weights are stored as a value array `vals`, a column index array `indices`, and a row pointer array `ptr`. Fetching row `i` involves accessing `vals[ptr[i]...ptr[i+1]-1]` and `indices[ptr[i]...ptr[i+1]-1]`. The memory controller will be designed to prefetch these potentially non-contiguous data elements efficiently, possibly using specialized caches for indices and values to exploit temporal and spatial locality in sparse access patterns. We will investigate mechanisms to handle dynamic updates to sparse structures during training.
    *   **Reconfigurable Interconnect Design:** We will explore Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures (e.g., mesh, torus) with added reconfigurability. The routing algorithms and virtual channel allocation will be adaptable based on statistics of the sparsity pattern collected during training (e.g., density, distribution of non-zeros). This could involve dynamically prioritizing communication paths between PEs processing dense blocks or broadcasting frequently accessed activations more efficiently. The goal is to minimize network latency and contention for sparse data movement.
    *   **Control Logic:** Develop the control logic for orchestrating the compute units, memory accesses, and interconnect configuration based on the sparse computation flow and runtime information.

*   **Phase 2: Co-Designed Sparse Training Algorithm Development (Months 4-9)**
    *   **Pruning Strategy Adaptation:** We will start with established dynamic sparse training methods (e.g., RigL [Not in Lit Review, but relevant], SET [Also relevant], or Dynamic Sparse Training [10]) and adapt them for the ACF. Adaptations include:
        *   *Pruning Granularity:* Matching the pruning granularity (individual weights, vectors, blocks) to the ACF's compute unit structure (e.g., if PEs operate on vectors, vector-level sparsity might be preferred).
        *   *Structured Sparsity:* Exploring hardware-friendly structured sparsity patterns (e.g., N:M sparsity, block sparsity) that can simplify the ACF's control logic and memory access patterns, potentially trading some flexibility for hardware efficiency. Evaluate the trade-off with unstructured sparsity supported by the baseline ACF design.
        *   *Sparsity Update Frequency:* Tuning how often sparsity masks are updated during training, considering the overhead of updating sparse data structures in the ACF memory system.
    *   **Sparse Data Representation:** Define the optimal sparse formats for weights, activations, and gradients within the ACF context. This involves considering storage overhead, ease of hardware processing, and efficiency of updates during backpropagation. We will compare formats like CSR, CSC, COO, and potentially bitmap-based representations.
    *   **Training Loop Integration:** Modify the forward pass, backward pass (backpropagation), and weight update steps to utilize the ACF's specific capabilities. For example, the sparse matrix multiplications in both forward and backward passes will be mapped to the ACF's compute units and memory system. Gradient accumulation will also need to handle sparsity. The update rule might look like:
        $$
        W_{t+1} = \text{Prune}( (W_t - \eta \nabla L(W_t)) \odot M_t )
        $$
        where $M_t$ is the sparsity mask at time $t$, $\odot$ is element-wise multiplication, $\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\nabla L(W_t)$ is the (potentially sparse) gradient. The `Prune` function incorporates the regrowth/redistribution logic co-designed with the ACF.

*   **Phase 3: Simulation Framework Implementation (Months 7-15)**
    *   **Architectural Simulation:** Utilize or extend a cycle-accurate architectural simulator (e.g., Gem5, or a custom simulator) to model the ACF's PEs, memory hierarchy, and NoC. The model will capture timing, resource utilization, and data movement.
    *   **Power Modeling:** Integrate power estimation models (e.g., based on McPAT or activity factors derived from the simulator) to estimate the energy consumption of the ACF components during training.
    *   **Deep Learning Framework Integration:** Develop interfaces (e.g., custom operators or backend extensions) for PyTorch/TensorFlow to offload sparse computations (like sparse matrix multiplication, sparse convolution) to the ACF simulator. This enables end-to-end training simulation.

*   **Phase 4: Experimental Design and Evaluation (Months 16-24)**
    *   **Datasets and Models:**
        *   Image Classification: CIFAR-10/100 (smaller scale), ImageNet (large scale). Models: ResNet-18/50, VGG-16.
        *   Natural Language Processing (potentially): BERT-base (Transformer model) on GLUE benchmark tasks (if simulation time allows).
    *   **Sparsity Targets:** Evaluate across a range of target sparsities (e.g., 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%) for both weights and potentially activations.
    *   **Baselines for Comparison:**
        1.  *Dense Training on GPU:* State-of-the-art GPU (e.g., NVIDIA A100) running standard dense training.
        2.  *Software Sparse Training on GPU:* The *same* sparse training algorithms used for the ACF, but implemented using optimized GPU libraries (e.g., cuSPARSE, custom kernels leveraging techniques similar to [3, 4], although these focused on inference or specific patterns). This isolates the benefit of the ACF hardware itself.
        3.  *Existing Sparse Training Accelerators (Simulated):* If possible, simulate simplified models of accelerators like Procrustes [1] or concepts from TensorDash [2] as additional baselines, based on published descriptions.
    *   **Evaluation Metrics:**
        *   *Performance:*
            *   End-to-end training time (wall clock time) to reach a target accuracy.
            *   Throughput (e.g., samples processed per second, effective GFLOPS/s accounting for sparsity).
            *   Speedup vs. baselines.
        *   *Energy Efficiency:*
            *   Total energy consumption (Joules) for training.
            *   Average power consumption (Watts).
            *   Energy efficiency (e.g., samples processed per Joule).
            *   Energy reduction vs. baselines.
        *   *Model Quality:*
            *   Final model accuracy (e.g., Top-1/Top-5 accuracy for image classification, relevant metrics for NLP tasks).
            *   Convergence curves (accuracy vs. epochs/time).
        *   *Hardware Cost (Estimated):*
            *   Area overhead estimation for ACF components (based on synthesis projections or modeling tools).
            *   Resource utilization within the simulator (PE utilization, memory bandwidth usage, network traffic).
        *   *Scalability Analysis:* How performance, energy, and accuracy scale with increasing model size and dataset complexity on the ACF compared to baselines.
