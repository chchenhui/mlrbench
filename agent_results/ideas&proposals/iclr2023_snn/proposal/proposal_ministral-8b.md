#### 2. Introduction

**Background:**
The rapid advancement of deep learning models has led to significant improvements in various applications, such as medical diagnostics, urban planning, and autonomous driving. However, the training of large models requires substantial computational resources, leading to high energy consumption and environmental impact. The challenge lies in balancing model performance with sustainability and efficiency. Sparse training algorithms, which aim to reduce the number of active parameters during training, offer a promising approach to mitigate these issues. However, current hardware architectures, such as GPUs, struggle with the irregular computation and memory access patterns inherent in sparse neural networks, limiting the practical speedups and energy savings achievable with sparse training algorithms.

**Research Objectives:**
The primary objective of this research is to design an adaptive compute fabric (ACF) specifically tailored for sparse operations in neural network training. The ACF will feature specialized compute units and memory controllers optimized for sparse computations, and will include reconfigurable interconnects to adapt dataflow to varying sparsity patterns. The research will also investigate pruning strategies to maximize ACF utilization and evaluate the impact on training time and energy consumption.

**Significance:**
The proposed ACF has the potential to significantly reduce the training time and energy consumption of sparse models, enabling the efficient training of much larger models. This research addresses a critical gap in the current hardware-software co-design landscape, aiming to achieve a balance between sustainability, efficiency, and performance in machine learning.
