**Title:** Dynamic Hardware-Aware Sparse Training via Co-Design Frameworks  

**Motivation:** Modern sparse training algorithms often ignore hardware constraints, leading to suboptimal deployment efficiency on GPUs/TPUs. As hardware struggles to support irregular sparsity patterns, computational gains from sparsity are diminished, hindering sustainable scaling of AI. Addressing the disconnect between algorithmic sparsity and hardware capabilities is critical for reducing energy consumption and e-waste.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a dynamic co-design framework that jointly optimizes sparse training algorithms and hardware-specific constraints (e.g., memory bandwidth, SIMD parallelism). Use reinforcement learning (RL) to evolve sparsity patterns that maximize accuracy while adhering to hardware-defined metrics (e.g., non-zero weight alignment, compute unit utilization). For instance, train a controller to adaptively adjust layer-wise sparsity ratios and connectivity topologies during training, guided by a differentiable reward function combining validation accuracy and simulated hardware latency. Evaluate the framework across diverse hardware (GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs) to learn transferable sparsity rules. Expected outcomes include improved energy efficiency (e.g., 2–3× speedup per FLOP) and hardware compatibility without sacrificing accuracy. Impact: Reduces carbon footprint and enables efficient deployment on edge devices and legacy systems, aligning AI scalability with sustainability goals.
