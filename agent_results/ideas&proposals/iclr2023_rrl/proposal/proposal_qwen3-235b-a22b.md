# **Retroactive Policy Correction in Reincarnating RL via Suboptimal Data Distillation**

---

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Background**
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains ranging from game play (e.g., AlphaGo, DQN) to robotics and resource management. However, traditional RL paradigms focus on *tabula rasa* learning—training agents from scratch without leveraging prior computational work. While effective for small-scale tasks, this approach becomes prohibitively expensive in large-scale or real-world applications, where training may require weeks of computation on specialized hardware. The workshop on *Reincarnating RL* (ICLR 2023) highlights a critical alternative: reusing prior computation (e.g., legacy policies, offline datasets, pretrained representations) to accelerate training and democratize access to complex RL problems. Yet, a major barrier to this paradigm is the *suboptimality* of prior computation. Real-world priors are often outdated, biased, or suboptimal due to partial observability, stale training regimes, or distributional shifts. Existing methods, such as fine-tuning or behavioral cloning, naively trust these priors, leading to error propagation and performance degradation.

This proposal addresses the challenge of **retroactively correcting suboptimal prior knowledge** in reincarnating RL. Our work is motivated by three observations:
1. **Real-world priors are imperfect**: Legacy policies and datasets often encode outdated strategies or systematic biases.
2. **Error compounding risks**: Naive reuse of flawed priors can amplify suboptimality, rendering new policies worse than scratch-trained ones.
3. **Need for robust distillation**: Effective reincarnation requires identifying and rectifying unreliable regions in prior data while preserving useful knowledge.

### **1.2 Research Objectives**
This work proposes a framework for **Retroactive Policy Correction (RPC)** in reincarnating RL, with three objectives:
1. **Uncertainty-aware distillation**: Train policies that dynamically discount unreliable prior knowledge using uncertainty estimates derived from Q-ensemble models.
2. **Suboptimal data correction**: Introduce a distillation loss function that prioritizes updates in high-certainty regions of the prior data, mitigating error propagation.
3. **Generalization across tasks**: Validate the framework on both discrete (Atari) and continuous (MuJoCo) control tasks under synthetic and real-world suboptimal priors.

### **1.3 Significance**
This research directly addresses key challenges identified in the Reincarnating RL workshop:
- **Democratization**: Enabling smaller teams to build on prior work without access to original training infrastructure.
- **Efficiency**: Reducing redundant computation by refining existing policies rather than retraining from scratch.
- **Safety**: Mitigating the risk of deploying flawed policies derived from suboptimal priors.

Our approach bridges the gap between theoretical reincarnation frameworks and practical deployment, offering a blueprint for iterative RL development in resource-constrained settings.

## **2. Methodology**

### **2.1 Data Collection & Preprocessing**
We evaluate the framework using two domains:
1. **Discrete Action Space**: Atari games (e.g., Pong, SpaceInvaders), using offline datasets generated by suboptimal policies (e.g., DQN variants with partial observability).
2. **Continuous Action Space**: MuJoCo environments (e.g., HalfCheetah, Walker2d), using datasets from stale policies trained with PPO.

#### **Suboptimality Injection**
To simulate real-world priors, we inject synthetic suboptimality:
- **Partial observability**: Mask state features in the prior dataset.
- **Stale policies**: Freeze outdated versions of DQN/PPO policies trained to suboptimal rewards.
- **Noisy transitions**: Add Gaussian noise to state-action pairs in the offline data.

The dataset is partitioned into high-uncertainty regions (intentionally degraded) and low-uncertainty regions (clean data).

### **2.2 Algorithmic Framework**

Our framework operates in two stages (Figure 1):

#### **Stage 1: Uncertainty Estimation via Q-Ensemble**
We train an ensemble of $ K $ Q-networks $\{Q^k_\phi(s, a)\}_{k=1}^K$ on the suboptimal dataset $\mathcal{D}$ using TD-learning:
$$
\mathcal{L}_Q(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{(s, a, r, s') \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K \left( Q^k_\phi(s, a) - \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} \bar{Q}^k_\phi(s', a') \right) \right)^2 \right],
$$
where $\gamma$ is the discount factor and $\bar{Q}^k_\phi$ are target networks. Uncertainty $U(s, a)$ is computed as the ensemble variance:
$$
U(s, a) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K \left( Q^k_\phi(s, a) - \bar{Q}_\phi(s, a) \right)^2,
$$
where $\bar{Q}_\phi(s, a) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K Q^k_\phi(s, a)$. High variance indicates unreliable priors.

#### **Stage 2: Policy Distillation with Uncertainty Weighting**
A policy $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ is trained via offline RL (e.g., BCQ, CQL) with a modified distillation loss:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(s, a) \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \beta \cdot w(s, a) \cdot \left( \pi_\theta(a|s) - \pi_{\text{old}}(a|s) \right)^2 - \lambda \cdot \log \pi_\theta(a|s) \right],
$$
where:
- $\pi_{\text{old}}(a|s)$ is the legacy policy used to generate $\mathcal{D}$,
- $w(s, a) = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha U(s, a)}$ downweights actions from high-uncertainty regions ($\alpha > 0$ controls sensitivity),
- The second term encourages exploration via entropy regularization ($\lambda$).

The final policy is optimized using PPO or SAC, balancing fidelity to the prior and correction for suboptimality.

### **2.3 Experimental Design**

#### **Baselines**
We compare against:
- **Naive Distillation**: Standard policy distillation without uncertainty weighting.
- **Offline RL (CQL)**: Train from scratch on the suboptimal dataset.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Resume training of the legacy policy.

#### **Metrics**
- **Asymptotic Performance**: Final episodic reward post-training.
- **Sample Efficiency**: Steps to reach baseline performance.
- **Robustness**: Performance decay under increasing suboptimality levels.
- **Uncertainty Calibration**: Correlation between $U(s, a)$ and posterior error in action labels.

#### **Ablation Studies**
1. Impact of ensemble size $K$.
2. Sensitivity to weighting function $w(s, a)$.
3. Comparison of TD vs. Monte Carlo uncertainty estimation.

## **3. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

### **3.1 Technical Contributions**
1. **Uncertainty-aware distillation framework**: A novel loss function integrating uncertainty weighting into policy distillation, enabling retroactive correction of suboptimal priors.
2. **Benchmarking protocol**: A standardized evaluation suite for reincarnating RL, including synthetic suboptimality injections for Atari and MuJoCo.
3. **Empirical insights**: Quantitative analysis of error propagation mechanisms and mitigation strategies in reincarnating RL.

### **3.2 Empirical Results**
We hypothesize that the proposed framework will:
1. **Outperform baselines** by ≥20% in reward when priors are severely suboptimal (e.g., 50% masked states).
2. **Generalize across domains**, achieving strong performance on both discrete and continuous tasks.
3. **Exhibit robust uncertainty calibration**, with $U(s, a)$ correlating strongly ($r > 0.7$) with posterior action error.

### **3.3 Scientific Impact**
1. **Democratizing RL**: By reducing reliance on perfect priors, our framework lowers the barrier for iterative RL research in low-resource settings.
2. **Safe reincarnation**: The method mitigates risks in high-stakes applications (e.g., healthcare, robotics) where prior policies may encode harmful strategies.
3. **Community-building**: The proposed benchmarks align with the Reincarnating RL workshop’s goals, fostering standardized evaluation protocols.

### **3.4 Limitations & Future Work**
1. **Computational Overhead**: Ensemble Q-learning incurs training costs quadratic in $K$. Future work could explore single-network uncertainty surrogates.
2. **Domain Shift**: The framework assumes prior and target tasks share a state-action space. Adapting to new domains would require auxiliary methods (e.g., latent alignment).
3. **Scalability**: Applying the method to foundation models or LLMs will require distributed training techniques.
