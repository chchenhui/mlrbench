1. Title  
Retroactive Policy Correction in Reincarnating Reinforcement Learning via Suboptimal Data Distillation  

2. Introduction  

Background  
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable successes in games, robotics, and complex control tasks. However, most of these advances rely on tabula‐rasa training, where agents learn from scratch without exploiting previously computed artifacts. Tabula‐rasa RL is not only sample‐inefficient but also imposes a high computational barrier that excludes smaller labs and practitioners from tackling large‐scale problems. In contrast, real‐world deployments of RL often involve iterative design cycles, where prior policies, datasets, models, or representations become available. We refer to this emerging paradigm of reusing prior computation in RL as “reincarnating RL.” By systematically leveraging legacy assets, reincarnating RL promises to accelerate agent development, reduce redundant computation, and democratize access to state‐of‐the‐art RL.  

Research Gap  
While recent works (Agarwal et al., 2022; Laskin et al., 2022; Silver et al., 2018) have explored fine‐tuning suboptimal policies, algorithm distillation, and residual learning, suboptimal or biased prior computation can propagate errors if naively reused. Existing methods often assume that prior policies or datasets are near‐optimal or treat them uniformly, neglecting the fact that real‐world priors may be stale, induced by partial observability, or simply suboptimal. There is a need for a principled framework that can:  
- Quantify the reliability of prior computation  
- Correct or reweight flawed artifacts during policy improvement  
- Maintain stability and convergence guarantees in the face of suboptimal data  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop and evaluate a framework for retroactive policy correction in reincarnating RL. The main objectives are:  
1. To design an uncertainty‐aware distillation mechanism that downweights unreliable actions in prior datasets or policies.  
2. To integrate this mechanism into an offline RL pipeline that jointly learns action‐value functions and a corrected policy.  
3. To provide theoretical insight into the stability and error propagation of the proposed method.  
4. To empirically validate the approach on standard benchmarks (Atari, MuJoCo) under controlled suboptimality injections.  

Significance  
A successful framework will:  
- Enable robust iterative improvements over flawed legacy agents  
- Reduce the computational cost of redeploying RL agents after design changes  
- Broaden community participation by lowering resource requirements  
- Bridge the gap between reincarnating RL theory and practice in real‐world scenarios  

3. Methodology  

Overview  
We propose a two‐stage algorithm, Retroactive Policy Correction (RPC), that (1) trains an ensemble of action‐value networks on suboptimal prior data to estimate uncertainty, and (2) performs offline policy learning with a distillation loss that downweights uncertain regions.  

3.1 Data Collection and Prior Artifacts  
• Prior Dataset $D = \{(s_i,a_i,r_i,s_i')\}_{i=1}^N$ compiled from:  
  – Legacy trajectories collected by an outdated policy $\pi_{\rm old}$  
  – Offline replay buffers with varying quality levels  
• Optionally, black‐box access to $\pi_{\rm old}(a\!\mid\!s)$ for direct policy distillation  

To simulate suboptimality, we will inject noise or truncate trajectories:  
- Partial observability: drop random state features in 20–50% of transitions  
- Stale policies: enforce early stopping at 30–50% of converged performance  
- Biased data: oversample rarely seen states  

3.2 Uncertainty Estimation via Q‐Ensemble  
We train an ensemble of $K$ Q‐networks $\{Q_{\theta_i}(s,a)\}_{i=1}^K$ on $D$ using standard Bellman error minimization. For each network:  
  
$$  
L_Q(\theta_i) \;=\; \mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s')\sim D}\Bigl[\bigl(Q_{\theta_i}(s,a)\;-\;y(s,a,r,s')\bigr)^2\Bigr],  
$$  

where the target $y$ uses a target‐network average:  

$$  
y(s,a,r,s') \;=\; r \;+\; \gamma \max_{a'} \overline{Q}(s',a'),  
\quad  
\overline{Q}(s',a') \;=\; \frac{1}{K}\sum_{j=1}^K Q_{\theta_j^-}(s',a').  
$$  

Here $\theta_j^-$ denotes the delayed parameters of the $j$‐th network. We update each $\theta_i$ by gradient descent and periodically sync target networks.  

Uncertainty Measure  
For any state‐action $(s,a)$, define empirical mean and variance:  

$$  
\mu_Q(s,a) \;=\; \frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=1}^K Q_{\theta_i}(s,a),  
\quad  
\sigma_Q^2(s,a) \;=\; \frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=1}^K \bigl(Q_{\theta_i}(s,a)-\mu_Q(s,a)\bigr)^2.  
$$  

We interpret $\sigma_Q(s,a)$ as an uncertainty score: high $\sigma_Q$ implies disagreement among ensemble members, signaling unreliable prior data.  

3.3 Distilled Offline Policy Learning  
We parameterize a new policy $\pi_\phi(a\!\mid\!s)$ (e.g., a Gaussian for continuous control or a softmax for discrete actions). Our objective blends:  
- A distillation term that imitates $\pi_{\rm old}$ where uncertainty is low  
- A conservative offline RL term that prevents overestimation in high‐uncertainty regions  

Let $w_\beta(s,a)=\exp(-\beta\,\sigma_Q(s,a))$ be a reliability weight with hyperparameter $\beta>0$. We minimize the joint loss:  

$$  
L(\phi)  
= \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{(s,a)\sim D}\bigl[-\,w_\beta(s,a)\,\log \pi_\phi(a\!\mid\!s)\bigr]}_{\text{corrected distillation}}  
\;+\;\alpha\;\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s')\sim D}\Bigl[\bigl(Q_{\mu}(s,a)-Q_{\pi_\phi}(s,a)\bigr)^2\Bigr]}_{\text{value‐penalty}},  
$$  

where $Q_{\mu}$ is the mean ensemble approximation and $Q_{\pi_\phi}$ is the action‐value under $\pi_\phi$ approximated via one‐step backup:  

$$  
Q_{\pi_\phi}(s,a)  
= r + \gamma \,\mathbb{E}_{a'\sim\pi_\phi(\cdot\mid s')}[\mu_Q(s',a')].  
$$  

The first term encourages the new policy to imitate $\pi_{\rm old}$ in regions of low uncertainty; the second term enforces conservative value learning to avoid spurious overestimation. Hyperparameters $\alpha,\beta$ are tuned on validation tasks.  

3.4 Algorithmic Steps  
1. Initialize ensemble $\{\theta_i\}_{i=1}^K$ and policy $\phi$.  
2. For $t=1$ to $T_Q$:  
   a. Sample minibatch from $D$.  
   b. Update each $Q_{\theta_i}$ by minimizing $L_Q(\theta_i)$.  
   c. Periodically sync $\theta_i^-\leftarrow \theta_i$.  
3. Compute $\mu_Q(s,a)$ and $\sigma_Q(s,a)$ for all $(s,a)\in D$.  
4. For $t=1$ to $T_\pi$:  
   a. Sample minibatch from $D$.  
   b. Compute $w_\beta(s,a)$.  
   c. Evaluate $Q_{\pi_\phi}(s,a)$ via one‐step backup.  
   d. Update policy parameters $\phi$ by descending $\nabla_\phi L(\phi)$.  
5. Return corrected policy $\pi_\phi$.  

3.5 Theoretical Considerations  
We will analyze the error propagation bound by extending the results of pessimistic offline RL (Kumar et al., 2020). In particular, we will show that with high probability:  

$$  
\|\pi_\phi - \pi^*\|_{1} \;\le\; O\Bigl(\sqrt{\frac{\log|A|}{N}}\Bigr) + O\bigl(\kappa(\beta)\bigr),  
$$  

where $\kappa(\beta)$ quantifies the bias introduced by weighting and $\pi^*$ is the optimal policy. By selecting $\beta$ appropriately, we can trade off bias and variance to minimize regret.  

3.6 Experimental Design  

Benchmarks  
• Discrete‐action environments: five Arcade Learning Environment games (e.g., Breakout, Seaquest).  
• Continuous‐control: four MuJoCo tasks (HalfCheetah, Hopper, Walker2d, Ant).  

Baselines  
• Fine‐tuning of $\pi_{\rm old}$ via SAC or DQN.  
• Offline RL algorithms: BCQ, CQL.  
• Naive policy distillation without uncertainty weighting.  
• Residual Policy Learning (Silver et al., 2018).  

Suboptimality Conditions  
We will vary:  
- Quality of $D$ (performance at 30%, 50%, 70% of full baseline).  
- Degree of partial observability (20%, 40%, 60% feature masking).  
- Noise levels in $\pi_{\rm old}$ (epsilon‐greedy corruption with $\epsilon\in\{0.1,0.3\}$).  

Evaluation Metrics  
• Mean episodic return across 10 evaluation seeds.  
• Sample efficiency: area under the learning curve (AUC) over wall‐clock or gradient steps.  
• Robustness: standard deviation of return across 5 reruns.  
• Ablations: performance as a function of ensemble size $K$ and weight parameter $\beta$.  

Compute and Reproducibility  
• Each experiment will be repeated with 5 random seeds.  
• All code, pretrained checkpoints, and datasets will be released under an open‐source license.  
• Experiments will run on standard GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA V100), with total compute budget capped at 5k GPU hours.  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

Expected Outcomes  
• Demonstration that RPC outperforms strong baselines (fine‐tuning, BCQ, CQL) across all suboptimality regimes, with up to 30% higher final return when prior data is severely degraded.  
• Empirical evidence that the reliability weighting $w_\beta$ effectively filters out high‐uncertainty actions, reducing error propagation and stabilizing training.  
• Ablation studies characterizing the sensitivity to ensemble size $K$ and weighting hyperparameter $\beta$, guiding practitioners on trade‐offs between compute and performance.  
• Theoretical bound showing that the added bias from distillation weighting is controlled, ensuring consistency as data size $N$ grows.  

Broader Impacts  
• Democratization of RL research: by enabling robust reuse of suboptimal artifacts, smaller labs can iterate on agent designs without retraining from scratch.  
• Environmental sustainability: reducing redundant training lowers energy consumption and carbon footprint associated with large‐scale RL.  
• Real‐world applicability: fields such as robotics, autonomous driving, and resource management can benefit from safe iterative improvements over existing controllers or simulators.  
• Benchmark and protocol: we will propose a standardized reincarnating RL evaluation suite, complete with datasets at multiple quality levels, to foster reproducible research and fair comparisons.  

Societal and Ethical Considerations  
While improving sample efficiency and reuse can accelerate deployment of RL systems, we will carefully assess failure modes in high‐uncertainty states. By integrating human‐in‐the‐loop monitoring or fallback policies, we aim to avoid unsafe behaviors in safety‐critical applications. All open‐source releases will include documentation on potential misuse and recommended safety practices.
