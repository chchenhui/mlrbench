# Retroactive Policy Correction in Reincarnating RL via Suboptimal Data Distillation

## 1. Introduction

Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable successes in various domains, from game playing to robotic control. However, the traditional paradigm of "tabula rasa" learning—starting from scratch without leveraging previously learned knowledge—remains computationally expensive and inefficient. This inefficiency not only wastes computational resources but also creates barriers to entry for researchers with limited access to high-performance computing infrastructure, effectively excluding a significant portion of the community from tackling challenging problems.

Reincarnating RL has emerged as a promising alternative paradigm that leverages prior computational work to accelerate training across iterations of an RL agent or when transitioning between agents. By utilizing pre-existing artifacts such as learned policies, offline datasets, or pretrained models, reincarnating RL aims to democratize access to complex RL problems while improving overall efficiency. Recent work by Agarwal et al. (2022) formalized this concept and demonstrated its potential for accelerating RL training in various contexts.

However, a critical challenge in reincarnating RL is dealing with suboptimal prior computation. Real-world systems often undergo multiple design or algorithmic changes during development, resulting in prior computational work that may be outdated, biased, or partially incorrect. Naive reuse of such suboptimal prior knowledge can propagate errors, constrain exploration, and ultimately limit the performance of the reincarnated agent. Existing methods often implicitly trust prior work without adequate mechanisms to identify and correct for its limitations.

### Research Objectives

This research proposal addresses the challenge of effectively leveraging suboptimal prior computation in reincarnating RL. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Develop a systematic framework for identifying and quantifying uncertainty in prior computational artifacts (e.g., policies, datasets).
2. Design a novel policy distillation approach that selectively incorporates reliable knowledge while correcting or discarding unreliable components.
3. Create efficient mechanisms for balancing the exploitation of prior knowledge with exploration of potentially better alternatives.
4. Evaluate the robustness of our approach across varying degrees of prior computation suboptimality.

### Significance

The proposed research addresses a fundamental gap in reincarnating RL: the assumption that prior computation is near-optimal or unbiased. By developing mechanisms to retroactively correct suboptimal prior knowledge, our work will:

1. **Enhance Robustness**: Enable reincarnating RL to function effectively even when prior computation contains significant flaws, increasing reliability in real-world applications.
2. **Improve Efficiency**: Reduce the resources needed to achieve high performance by intelligently leveraging useful parts of prior knowledge while mitigating harmful effects of suboptimal components.
3. **Democratize Access**: Lower the barrier to entry for tackling complex RL problems by making effective use of publicly available but imperfect pre-trained agents or datasets.
4. **Enable Iterative Development**: Facilitate continuous improvement of RL systems over time by allowing different research teams to build upon each other's work without repeating computation, even when previous work contains errors.

By addressing these challenges, our research will contribute significantly to the emerging paradigm of reincarnating RL, making it more practical, accessible, and robust for real-world applications.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed approach, Retroactive Policy Correction via Suboptimal Data Distillation (RPC-SDD), consists of three main components: (1) uncertainty estimation in prior computation, (2) selective distillation with confidence-weighted learning, and (3) adaptive exploration guided by uncertainty. The overall pipeline is designed to identify reliable parts of prior computation, correct or discard unreliable parts, and intelligently explore alternatives where the prior knowledge is uncertain.

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

We consider a Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined by the tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, P, R, \gamma)$, where $\mathcal{S}$ is the state space, $\mathcal{A}$ is the action space, $P: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{S} \rightarrow [0, 1]$ is the transition probability function, $R: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the reward function, and $\gamma \in [0, 1)$ is the discount factor.

In the reincarnating RL setting, we have access to prior computation in one or more of the following forms:
- A dataset $\mathcal{D}_{\text{prior}} = \{(s_i, a_i, r_i, s'_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ of state-action-reward-next state tuples
- A prior policy $\pi_{\text{prior}}: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \Delta(\mathcal{A})$ mapping states to distributions over actions
- A prior value function $Q_{\text{prior}}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$

Our goal is to learn an improved policy $\pi_{\text{new}}$ that outperforms $\pi_{\text{prior}}$ while minimizing additional environment interactions.

### 2.2 Uncertainty Estimation in Prior Computation

We propose using an ensemble of $K$ Q-networks to estimate both the expected action-values and the uncertainty in these estimates:

$$Q_{\theta_k}(s, a), k \in \{1, 2, ..., K\}$$

Each Q-network is trained on the prior dataset $\mathcal{D}_{\text{prior}}$ using standard TD learning:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{TD}}(\theta_k) = \mathbb{E}_{(s, a, r, s') \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{prior}}} \left[ \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\theta_k^-}(s', a') - Q_{\theta_k}(s, a) \right)^2 \right]$$

where $\theta_k^-$ represents the parameters of a target network. To induce diversity in the ensemble, we initialize each network with different random seeds and train on bootstrap samples of the dataset.

We then define the mean Q-value and uncertainty for each state-action pair:

$$\mu_Q(s, a) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K Q_{\theta_k}(s, a)$$

$$\sigma_Q(s, a) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K (Q_{\theta_k}(s, a) - \mu_Q(s, a))^2}$$

Additionally, we train a separate ensemble of models to predict the next state and reward:

$$\hat{s}'_{k}, \hat{r}_{k} = f_{\phi_k}(s, a), k \in \{1, 2, ..., K\}$$

The dynamics uncertainty is calculated as:

$$\sigma_{\text{dyn}}(s, a) = \frac{1}{K(K-1)} \sum_{i=1}^K \sum_{j=i+1}^K d(\hat{s}'_i, \hat{s}'_j)$$

where $d(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a distance metric appropriate for the state space (e.g., L2 norm for continuous states).

The overall uncertainty measure combines both value and dynamics uncertainty:

$$u(s, a) = \alpha \cdot \text{normalize}(\sigma_Q(s, a)) + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \text{normalize}(\sigma_{\text{dyn}}(s, a))$$

where $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ is a hyperparameter and normalize scales each uncertainty term to $[0, 1]$.

### 2.3 Confidence-Weighted Policy Distillation

We train a new policy $\pi_{\text{new}}$ parameterized by $\psi$ to distill knowledge from the prior computation while accounting for uncertainty. The policy is trained with a combination of standard RL objectives and a confidence-weighted distillation loss.

For the RL component, we use a conservative Q-learning approach:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{CQL}}(\theta) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{TD}}(\theta) + \beta \cdot \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{prior}}} \left[ \log \sum_a \exp(Q_{\theta}(s, a)) - \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{prior}}(a|s)} [Q_{\theta}(s, a)] \right]$$

The policy is trained to maximize the learned Q-function while incorporating uncertainty:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}}(\psi) = -\mathbb{E}_{s \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{prior}}} \left[ \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_{\psi}(a|s)} [Q_{\theta}(s, a)] \right]$$

The confidence-weighted distillation loss encourages the new policy to match the prior policy in regions of low uncertainty:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}}(\psi) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{prior}}} \left[ \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_{\text{prior}}(a|s)} [(1 - u(s, a)) \cdot D_{\text{KL}}(\pi_{\psi}(\cdot|s) \| \pi_{\text{prior}}(\cdot|s))] \right]$$

where $D_{\text{KL}}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The weight $(1 - u(s, a))$ ensures that the distillation loss is stronger for state-action pairs with low uncertainty.

The overall policy loss combines these components:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{policy}}(\psi) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}}(\psi) + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}}(\psi)$$

where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter controlling the strength of the distillation loss.

### 2.4 Uncertainty-Guided Exploration

To address exploration in regions where the prior computation is uncertain, we incorporate an uncertainty-guided exploration bonus. When collecting new data, we sample actions according to:

$$a \sim \pi_{\text{explore}}(\cdot|s) \propto \exp\left(\frac{Q_{\theta}(s, a) + \eta \cdot u(s, a)}{\tau}\right)$$

where $\eta$ is a hyperparameter controlling the exploration weight and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.

The collected trajectories are added to an experience replay buffer $\mathcal{D}_{\text{new}}$. The policy and Q-functions are then updated using a mixture of the prior dataset and the new dataset:

$$\mathcal{D}_{\text{mixed}} = \{(1-\rho) \cdot \mathcal{D}_{\text{prior}}, \rho \cdot \mathcal{D}_{\text{new}}\}$$

where $\rho$ is a mixing coefficient that increases gradually over time, giving more weight to newer data as training progresses.

### 2.5 Algorithm Summary

The complete RPC-SDD algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. Initialize ensemble of Q-networks $\{Q_{\theta_k}\}_{k=1}^K$ and dynamics models $\{f_{\phi_k}\}_{k=1}^K$
2. Train the ensembles on $\mathcal{D}_{\text{prior}}$ to estimate uncertainty $u(s, a)$
3. Initialize policy network $\pi_{\psi}$ and new replay buffer $\mathcal{D}_{\text{new}}$
4. For $t = 1, 2, ..., T$:
   a. Collect trajectories using uncertainty-guided exploration policy $\pi_{\text{explore}}$
   b. Add trajectories to $\mathcal{D}_{\text{new}}$
   c. Update mixing coefficient $\rho_t = \min(1, \rho_0 + t/T)$
   d. Sample batches from $\mathcal{D}_{\text{mixed}}$
   e. Update Q-networks using $\mathcal{L}_{\text{CQL}}$
   f. Update policy using $\mathcal{L}_{\text{policy}}$
   g. Periodically update uncertainty estimates using the latest data

### 2.6 Experimental Design

We will evaluate RPC-SDD across several domains with varying levels of prior computation suboptimality:

1. **Atari Games**: We'll use the Arcade Learning Environment, focusing on 10 diverse games. Prior computation will be in the form of policies trained with outdated algorithms (e.g., DQN) or under different environmental parameters.

2. **Continuous Control Tasks**: We'll use MuJoCo environments (HalfCheetah, Walker2D, Hopper) with prior policies trained under different dynamics or reward functions.

3. **Synthetic Suboptimality Scenarios**:
   - **Partial Observability**: Prior policies trained with limited observations
   - **Domain Shift**: Prior policies trained in slightly different environments
   - **Reward Misspecification**: Prior policies optimized for incorrect reward functions
   - **Outdated Policies**: Prior policies stopped before convergence

For each scenario, we'll introduce controlled levels of suboptimality by:
- Injecting noise into demonstrations
- Using policies trained with various constraints
- Artificially biasing the offline datasets

### 2.7 Baselines and Evaluation Metrics

We will compare RPC-SDD against the following baselines:

1. **Tabula Rasa RL**: Training from scratch without prior computation
2. **Naive Policy Transfer**: Direct initialization from prior policy without correction
3. **Standard Policy Distillation**: Distillation without uncertainty weighting
4. **Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)**: Offline RL on the prior dataset
5. **Recent Transfer Methods**: Including those from Agarwal et al. (2022) and Residual Policy Learning (Silver et al., 2018)

Evaluation metrics will include:

1. **Sample Efficiency**: Number of environment interactions needed to reach performance thresholds
2. **Asymptotic Performance**: Final performance after fixed training budget
3. **Robustness to Prior Suboptimality**: Performance across varying levels of prior computation quality
4. **Computation Overhead**: Additional computation required for uncertainty estimation and distillation
5. **Ablation Analysis**: Contribution of each component (uncertainty estimation, selective distillation, uncertainty-guided exploration)

We will run all experiments with 5 random seeds and report mean and standard deviation for statistical significance.

By developing methods to identify, quantify, and correct for suboptimality in prior knowledge, we will enable more robust, efficient, and accessible reinforcement learning systems that can build upon existing work without being constrained by its limitations. This research will contribute significantly to the emerging paradigm of reincarnating RL, helping to establish it as a practical alternative to the resource-intensive tabula rasa approach that currently dominates the field.
