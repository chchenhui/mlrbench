**Title:** Adaptive Meta-Gating for Robust Utilization of Suboptimal Prior Computation in RL  

**Motivation:** Suboptimal prior computation (e.g., imperfect policies, noisy datasets, or biased models) poses a critical hurdle in reincarnating RL. Blindly reusing such resources can degrade training efficiency or final performance. Addressing this challenge is essential to democratize RL, as real-world prior work is often imperfect, and methods must be robust to variability in resource quality.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a meta-learning framework that dynamically evaluates and selectively integrates suboptimal prior components (e.g., policies, data) during training. The core innovation is a *gating network* trained alongside the policy, which uses context (e.g., state, uncertainty estimates) to weight the influence of prior resources at each decision point. For example, in policy reuse, the gating network could suppress actions from a prior policy in states where its value estimates are low. The framework will leverage meta-gradient updates to adapt gating behavior across tasks and prior resource qualities. Methodology includes: (1) benchmarking suboptimality scenarios (e.g., partially mismatched policies), (2) integrating uncertainty-aware gating, and (3) meta-training the gating mechanism to generalize across resource types. Expected outcomes include improved sample efficiency and final performance in reincarnating RL settings with noisy or imperfect priors, enabling broader adoption in resource-constrained settings.
