**Title:** Adaptive Policy Distillation from Multiple Suboptimal Teachers

**Motivation:** Reincarnating RL often involves prior computation from several sources (e.g., policies trained with different algorithms or hyperparameters), which are likely suboptimal. Blindly combining or fine-tuning from these can inherit biases or lead to conflicting updates. We need a method to intelligently leverage multiple, potentially conflicting, suboptimal policies.

**Main Idea:** Propose an Adaptive Policy Distillation (APD) framework. Given multiple suboptimal teacher policies, APD first estimates the competence of each teacher in different regions of the state space, possibly using offline evaluation metrics or limited online interaction. Then, during student policy training (either offline or online fine-tuning), APD dynamically weights the distillation loss from each teacher based on their estimated competence in the current state. This allows the student to learn selectively, prioritizing guidance from the most reliable teacher for a given situation while mitigating risks from poor prior knowledge. Expected outcomes include faster learning and superior performance compared to using single teachers or naive averaging, enabling more robust reincarnation from diverse prior computations.
