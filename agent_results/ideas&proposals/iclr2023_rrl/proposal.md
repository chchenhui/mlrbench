**1. Title: Retroactive Policy Correction in Reincarnating RL via Suboptimal Data Distillation**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems, ranging from game playing (Mnih et al., 2015) to robotics (Levine et al., 2016) and resource management (Agarwal et al., 2022). However, the dominant paradigm in RL research remains *tabula rasa* learning, where agents are trained from scratch with minimal prior knowledge. While effective in controlled research environments, this approach suffers from significant drawbacks in practical, large-scale applications. Training *tabula rasa* is computationally intensive and sample inefficient, often requiring millions or billions of interactions, limiting its applicability to resource-constrained settings and excluding a large portion of the research community from tackling challenging problems.

Furthermore, real-world RL systems are rarely static. They often undergo iterative development cycles involving changes in task specifications, environment dynamics, sensory inputs, or algorithmic components. Retraining from scratch after each modification is frequently infeasible due to prohibitive costs. Practitioners often resort to ad-hoc methods for incorporating changes, lacking principled ways to leverage previous computational investments.

Recognizing these limitations, the emerging paradigm of "Reincarnating RL" (Agarwal et al., 2022) advocates for reusing prior computational artifacts – such as learned policies, offline datasets, value functions, dynamics models, or representations – to accelerate training and improve efficiency across agent development iterations or when transferring knowledge between agents. This paradigm holds immense promise for democratizing RL research, enabling faster progress on complex tasks, and facilitating continuous improvement of deployed systems.

However, a critical and underexplored challenge within Reincarnating RL is dealing with the inherent *suboptimality* of prior computational work. Prior artifacts (e.g., datasets collected by partially trained policies, policies trained under different objectives, or representations learned on slightly mismatched tasks) are rarely perfect. Naively reusing or fine-tuning from suboptimal priors can propagate errors, lead to biased learning, hinder convergence to optimal solutions, and potentially result in catastrophic performance degradation. Existing methods like simple fine-tuning (Agarwal et al., 2022) or residual policy learning (Silver et al., 2018) often implicitly trust the prior or lack mechanisms to critically evaluate and correct its flaws during the learning process. Addressing the challenge of suboptimal priors is crucial for unlocking the full potential of Reincarnating RL in practical scenarios where imperfections are the norm.

**2.2 Research Objectives**
This research proposes a novel framework, termed **Retroactive Policy Correction (RPC)**, designed explicitly to address the challenge of learning effectively from suboptimal prior data within the Reincarnating RL paradigm. Our primary objective is to develop and evaluate a method that can distill a corrected, high-performance policy by selectively leveraging reliable information from potentially flawed prior computational artifacts (specifically, offline datasets generated by prior policies) while identifying and mitigating the negative influence of suboptimal or unreliable parts of this prior data.

The specific objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop the RPC Framework:** Formulate and implement the RPC algorithm, which involves two key stages:
    *   Learning an ensemble of Q-networks on the prior offline dataset to generate state-action value estimates and quantify epistemic uncertainty, identifying regions where the prior data is unreliable or conflicting.
    *   Training a new policy using an offline RL algorithm augmented with a novel uncertainty-aware distillation loss. This loss mechanism will guide the policy to adhere to prior actions in regions of low uncertainty (high confidence) while downweighting or ignoring prior actions in regions of high uncertainty (low confidence), allowing the agent to correct flaws and explore potentially better actions.
2.  **Quantify Uncertainty for Policy Correction:** Investigate effective methods for quantifying uncertainty from Q-network ensembles (e.g., variance, standard deviation) and design a mechanism to translate this uncertainty into a weighting scheme for the distillation loss, effectively modulating the influence of the prior data.
3.  **Evaluate RPC Performance Robustly:** Systematically evaluate the performance of RPC across a range of standard RL benchmarks (e.g., Atari games, continuous control tasks from D4RL). Compare RPC against relevant baselines, including:
    *   Learning *tabula rasa*.
    *   Standard offline RL algorithms (e.g., Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), Implicit Q-Learning (IQL)) trained directly on the suboptimal prior dataset.
    *   Behavior Cloning (BC) on the prior dataset.
    *   Simple fine-tuning approaches (where applicable, e.g., fine-tuning the policy that generated the data if available).
4.  **Assess Robustness to Suboptimality:** Investigate the robustness of RPC by injecting controlled types and levels of suboptimality into the prior datasets (e.g., data from early training checkpoints, data from policies with partial observability, noisy data, mixtures of data from different quality policies). Analyze how RPC performance degrades compared to baselines as the quality of the prior data decreases.
5.  **Ablation Studies:** Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of key components of the RPC framework, such as the uncertainty estimation method, the ensemble size, the formulation of the uncertainty-aware distillation loss, and the balance between offline RL learning and prior distillation.

**2.3 Significance**
This research directly addresses a critical bottleneck in the practical application and advancement of Reincarnating RL: the handling of suboptimal prior computation. By developing a principled approach to identify and correct flaws in prior data, RPC offers several significant potential contributions:

*   **Enhanced Efficiency and Performance:** RPC aims to accelerate RL training and achieve better final performance compared to *tabula rasa* learning or naive reuse methods, especially when starting from imperfect priors.
*   **Increased Robustness:** By explicitly accounting for potential suboptimality, RPC can lead to more robust learning processes that are less susceptible to failure modes caused by flawed prior knowledge. This is crucial for reliable iterative development and deployment of RL agents.
*   **Democratization of Large-Scale RL:** By enabling effective reuse of potentially imperfect prior artifacts (e.g., released datasets, checkpoints from previous experiments), RPC can lower the computational barrier for researchers and practitioners, allowing broader participation in tackling complex RL problems without requiring massive *tabula rasa* training budgets.
*   **Bridging Theory and Practice:** This work aims to bridge the gap between the idealized concept of reusing perfect prior knowledge and the practical reality where available artifacts are often flawed. It provides a concrete algorithmic solution for a common real-world challenge in iterative RL development.
*   **Contribution to Offline RL:** The proposed uncertainty-aware distillation mechanism may offer insights and techniques applicable to the broader field of offline RL, particularly in scenarios involving heterogeneous or potentially unreliable datasets.

Successfully achieving the objectives of this proposal will provide a valuable tool for the RL community, fostering more efficient, robust, and accessible development pathways for advanced RL agents, directly aligning with the core goals highlighted by the Reincarnating RL workshop.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework: Retroactive Policy Correction (RPC)**
The proposed RPC framework operates in two main phases, utilizing a given offline dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(s_i, a_i, r_i, s'_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ assumed to be generated by one or more potentially suboptimal prior policies $\pi_{\text{prior}}$.

*   **Phase 1: Uncertainty-Aware Value Estimation:** Train an ensemble of $K$ Q-networks $\{Q_{\theta_k}\}_{k=1}^K$ on the dataset $\mathcal{D}$ using techniques common in offline RL and uncertainty estimation. The goal is not just to estimate Q-values but also to quantify the epistemic uncertainty associated with these estimates for given state-action pairs $(s, a)$.
*   **Phase 2: Uncertainty-Weighted Policy Distillation:** Train a new target policy $\pi_{\phi}$ using an offline RL algorithm. The learning objective is modified to incorporate an uncertainty-aware distillation term that encourages $\pi_{\phi}$ to mimic the actions $a$ present in the dataset $\mathcal{D}$ for a given state $s$, but only when the ensemble's uncertainty about the value of $(s, a)$ is low. When uncertainty is high, the influence of the prior action $a$ is reduced, allowing the offline RL objective to dominate and potentially correct the policy.

**3.2 Data Collection and Preparation**
We will primarily utilize existing standard offline RL benchmark datasets, such as those derived from the Atari 100k (Agarwal et al., 2021) and D4RL (Fu et al., 2020) suites (e.g., MuJoCo continuous control tasks). These datasets inherently contain varying levels of suboptimality based on how they were collected (e.g., mixing data from different policies or checkpoints).

To systematically study the effect of suboptimality, we will also generate controlled prior datasets by:

1.  **Using Checkpoints:** Training an expert policy and generating datasets using policy checkpoints from different stages of training (early, middle, late).
2.  **Injecting Noise:** Adding noise to actions or observations during data collection with a trained policy.
3.  **Introducing Partial Observability:** Training or collecting data with agents that have limited or corrupted state information.
4.  **Mixing Data Sources:** Creating datasets by mixing transitions collected from policies of varying quality or different underlying algorithms.
5.  **Using Outdated Policies:** Simulating scenarios where the environment dynamics or reward function may have slightly shifted since the prior data was collected (if feasible within standard benchmarks or through minor modifications).

This allows us to precisely control the type and degree of suboptimality in $\mathcal{D}$ for rigorous evaluation.

**3.3 Algorithmic Details**

**Phase 1: Uncertainty Estimation via Ensemble Q-Learning**
We train an ensemble of $K$ Q-networks, $\{Q_{\theta_k}\}_{k=1}^K$. Each $Q_{\theta_k}$ is trained to minimize a standard offline Q-learning objective, such as the Bellman error, potentially augmented with offline RL regularization techniques (e.g., inspired by CQL (Kumar et al., 2020) or IQL (Kostrikov et al., 2021)) to handle out-of-distribution actions. Ensemble diversity can be encouraged through techniques like bootstrapped sampling of the dataset $\mathcal{D}$ for each ensemble member and random network initializations.

Let $Q_{\theta_k}(s, a)$ be the Q-value estimate of the $k$-th network for state-action pair $(s, a)$. The ensemble provides a distribution of value estimates. We define the mean Q-value prediction as:
$$ \bar{Q}(s, a) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K Q_{\theta_k}(s, a) $$
We quantify the epistemic uncertainty $\sigma(s, a)$ associated with the value estimate for $(s, a)$ using the standard deviation (or variance) across the ensemble predictions:
$$ \sigma(s, a) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K (Q_{\theta_k}(s, a) - \bar{Q}(s, a))^2} $$
High values of $\sigma(s, a)$ indicate disagreement among ensemble members, suggesting higher uncertainty about the true value of the action $a$ in state $s$ based on the given data $\mathcal{D}$. This disagreement can stem from insufficient data coverage, conflicting data signals (indicative of suboptimality), or inherent stochasticity that is difficult to model.

**Phase 2: Corrective Policy Distillation**
We train a target policy $\pi_{\phi}(a|s)$ using an offline RL approach. The core idea is to leverage a base offline RL objective $\mathcal{L}_{\text{offline}}$ (e.g., based on IQL's value function learning and advantage weighting, or CQL's Q-value regularization) and augment it with an uncertainty-weighted distillation term $\mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}}$.

The overall objective function for training the policy $\pi_{\phi}$ (and potentially its associated value functions) can be formulated as:
$$ \mathcal{L}(\phi) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{offline}}(\phi) + \lambda \cdot \mathbb{E}_{(s, a) \sim \mathcal{D}} [w(s, a) \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{prior}}( \pi_{\phi}(a|s), a )] $$
where:
*   $\mathcal{L}_{\text{offline}}(\phi)$ is the objective function derived from a chosen base offline RL algorithm (e.g., policy improvement term in actor-critic setups, potentially involving learned value functions).
*   $\lambda \ge 0$ is a hyperparameter balancing the standard offline learning objective with the distillation from the prior data.
*   $(s, a) \sim \mathcal{D}$ denotes sampling state-action pairs from the prior dataset.
*   $\mathcal{L}_{\text{prior}}(\pi_{\phi}(a|s), a)$ is a loss function measuring the discrepancy between the policy's action distribution (or sampled action) and the prior action $a$ from the dataset. Common choices include the negative log-likelihood (for discrete actions) or mean squared error (for continuous actions), similar to Behavior Cloning:
    *   Discrete actions: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{prior}} = -\log \pi_{\phi}(a|s)$
    *   Continuous actions: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{prior}} = \| \mu_{\phi}(s) - a \|^2$, where $\mu_{\phi}(s)$ is the mean action output by a deterministic policy $\pi_{\phi}$. Other policy structures (e.g., stochastic Gaussian) can be used accordingly.
*   $w(s, a)$ is the crucial uncertainty-aware weight function. It should assign higher weights when uncertainty $\sigma(s, a)$ is low, and lower weights when uncertainty is high. A candidate function is an exponential decay based on the uncertainty:
    $$ w(s, a) = \exp(-\beta \cdot \sigma(s, a)) $$
    where $\beta > 0$ is a sensitivity parameter controlling how rapidly the weight decays with increasing uncertainty. The uncertainty $\sigma(s, a)$ is computed using the ensemble trained in Phase 1. The actions $a$ used for computing $\sigma(s, a)$ would typically be the actions present in the dataset $\mathcal{D}$ for state $s$. For policy training involving actions not in $\mathcal{D}$, alternative uncertainty computations might be needed or the distillation term might only apply to in-distribution actions.

This formulation allows the policy $\pi_{\phi}$ to learn from the offline RL objective (aiming for optimality based on estimated values) while being gently guided by the prior data $a$ primarily in state-action regions deemed reliable (low $\sigma(s, a)$) by the ensemble. In high uncertainty regions, the weight $w(s, a)$ diminishes, reducing the influence of potentially suboptimal prior actions and allowing the offlineRL component $\mathcal{L}_{\text{offline}}$ to drive policy updates, potentially correcting the prior's mistakes.

**3.4 Experimental Design**

*   **Environments:**
    *   **Atari Games:** Utilize the Atari 100k benchmark datasets (Agarwal et al., 2021), which provide offline data collected during the first 100k environment steps of DQN training. This naturally contains heterogeneity and suboptimality. We will select a representative subset of games (e.g., Pong, Breakout, Q*bert, Seaquest).
    *   **Continuous Control:** Employ D4RL benchmarks (Fu et al., 2020), focusing on MuJoCo locomotor tasks (e.g., HalfCheetah, Hopper, Walker2d). We will use various dataset types provided by D4RL ('medium', 'medium-replay', 'medium-expert') which explicitly capture different levels of data quality and suboptimality. We will also synthetically generate datasets as described in Section 3.2.
*   **Baselines:**
    *   **Tabula Rasa:** Train leading online RL algorithms (e.g., Rainbow DQN for Atari, SAC for MuJoCo) from scratch (as an upper bound reference where feasible, though computationally expensive).
    *   **Behavior Cloning (BC):** Train a policy solely by imitating the actions in the prior dataset $\mathcal{D}$.
    *   **Offline RL:** Apply state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms (e.g., CQL, IQL) directly to the dataset $\mathcal{D}$.
    *   **Naive Fine-tuning / Prior Reuse:** Where applicable (e.g., if the policy generating $\mathcal{D}$ is available), use simple fine-tuning (Agarwal et al., 2022) or potentially Residual Policy Learning (Silver et al., 2018) if a base policy is explicitly given and the framework applies. For dataset reincarnation, this might correspond to initializing the policy network with weights pre-trained via BC on $\mathcal{D}$.
*   **RPC Implementation:**
    *   We will implement RPC based on a strong offline RL algorithm backbone (e.g., IQL or CQL).
    *   Ensemble size $K$ will be varied (e.g., $K \in \{3, 5, 10\}$).
    *   Hyperparameters $\lambda$ and $\beta$ will be tuned via grid search or other optimization methods on a validation set or held-out tasks.
*   **Evaluation Procedure:**
    *   Policies trained using each method (RPC, baselines) will be evaluated by deploying them online in the respective environments.
    *   Performance will be measured by the average total reward accumulated over multiple evaluation episodes (e.g., 10-100 episodes per seed).
    *   Learning curves (performance vs. training steps/epochs) and final performance statistics (mean and standard deviation across multiple random seeds, e.g., 5-10 seeds) will be reported.
    *   Statistical significance tests (e.g., t-tests or bootstrap confidence intervals) will be used to compare methods.
*   **Suboptimality Robustness Analysis:** Performance will be plotted as a function of the controlled level of suboptimality introduced into the prior datasets (e.g., percentage of data from suboptimal source, noise level, training checkpoint used for data generation). We expect RPC to show slower degradation in performance compared to baselines as suboptimality increases.
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    *   **Effect of Uncertainty:** Compare full RPC with variants where $w(s, a)=1$ (equivalent to standard BC loss added to offline RL) or where uncertainty measure is different (e.g., using dropout-based uncertainty).
    *   **Effect of Ensemble Size ($K$):** Evaluate performance with varying $K$.
    *   **Sensitivity to $\lambda$ and $\beta$:** Analyze how performance changes with different values of the balancing and sensitivity parameters.
    *   **Choice of Base Offline RL Algorithm:** Test RPC built upon different offline RL backbones (e.g., IQL vs. CQL).

**3.5 Evaluation Metrics**
*   **Primary Metric:** Normalized Average Return. Scores will be normalized based on standard methods for each benchmark suite (e.g., using random policy score and expert score) to allow for comparison across different tasks.
*   **Secondary Metrics:**
    *   Final convergence performance (average return after training completion).
    *   Sample efficiency during the offline training phase (if relevant, e.g., comparing wall-clock time or gradient steps required).
    *   Robustness Score: Could be defined as the area under the performance vs. suboptimality level curve.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**
We hypothesize that the RPC framework will demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods when learning from suboptimal prior datasets in RL. Specifically, we expect the following outcomes:

1.  **Superior Performance:** RPC is expected to outperform baseline methods (standard offline RL, BC, naive fine-tuning) in terms of final policy performance, particularly when the prior dataset $\mathcal{D}$ contains substantial suboptimality or conflicting information.
2.  **Improved Robustness:** RPC should exhibit greater robustness to variations in the quality of the prior data. We expect its performance advantage over baselines to increase as the level of suboptimality in the prior dataset grows.
3.  **Effective Uncertainty Utilization:** The experimental results, particularly the ablation studies, should demonstrate that the uncertainty estimation and the uncertainty-weighting mechanism ($w(s,a)$) are crucial components contributing to RPC's success. We expect to gain insights into how epistemic uncertainty can effectively guide policy correction in offline settings.
4.  **Validation across Diverse Domains:** Successful application on both discrete (Atari) and continuous (MuJoCo) control tasks will validate the generality of the RPC framework.
5.  **Algorithmic Release:** A well-documented implementation of the RPC algorithm will be released as open-source code to facilitate reproducibility and adoption by the community.
6.  **Publication:** The findings will be compiled into a high-quality research paper suitable for submission to a top-tier machine learning conference (e.g., ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML) or journal.

**4.2 Potential Impact**
This research has the potential to make a significant impact on the field of Reinforcement Learning, particularly concerning the practical application and development of Reincarnating RL:

*   **Advancing Reincarnating RL:** RPC provides a concrete, principled solution to the critical problem of handling suboptimal priors, moving the Reincarnating RL paradigm closer to practical utility. It directly addresses a key challenge highlighted in the workshop call.
*   **Enabling Efficient Iterative Development:** By allowing effective reuse of imperfect data from previous iterations, RPC can drastically reduce the computational cost and time required for updating and improving RL agents in deployed systems or during lengthy research cycles.
*   **Democratizing Access to Large-Scale RL:** By making it feasible to build upon potentially flawed but publicly available datasets or model checkpoints, RPC lowers the barrier to entry for researchers and institutions with limited computational resources to work on challenging, large-scale RL problems.
*   **Improving Safety and Reliability:** By explicitly identifying and downweighting unreliable prior information, RPC may lead to safer RL systems that are less prone to inheriting and propagating potentially harmful biases or suboptimal behaviors from prior data.
*   **Informing Future Research:** This work could inspire further research into uncertainty-aware learning in RL, novel methods for distilling knowledge from heterogeneous data sources, and theoretical analyses of learning convergence and optimality guarantees when reusing imperfect prior computation.

In conclusion, the proposed Retroactive Policy Correction framework offers a promising direction for tackling the suboptimality challenge in Reincarnating RL. By enabling agents to critically assess and selectively leverage prior computational work, this research aims to contribute significantly to the development of more efficient, robust, and accessible reinforcement learning methodologies.
