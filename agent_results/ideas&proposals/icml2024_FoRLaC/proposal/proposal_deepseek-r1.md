### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in complex decision-making tasks, yet its adoption in safety-critical domains like autonomous vehicles, robotics, and industrial automation remains limited due to the lack of formal stability and robustness guarantees. In contrast, control theory provides well-established tools such as Lyapunov functions, which mathematically certify system stability but require precise system models that are often unavailable in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in deep learning enable approximation of Lyapunov functions using neural networks. However, integrating these approximations into RL frameworks to achieve both adaptability and safety remains an open challenge.  

Existing works—such as **Neural Lyapunov Function Approximation with Self-Supervised RL** (McCutcheon et al., 2025) and **SAC-CLF** (Chen et al., 2025)—highlight the potential of merging RL with Lyapunov stability theory but face limitations in generalizability and computational efficiency. A key gap lies in the *joint optimization* of policies and Lyapunov functions, enabling systems to adapt dynamically while preserving stability under perturbations.  

**Research Objectives**  
1. Develop a framework for training RL policies with neural Lyapunov functions that guarantees bounded state deviations and robustness to perturbations.  
2. Provide theoretical stability certificates for nonlinear systems via Lyapunov decay conditions.  
3. Validate the approach on high-dimensional control benchmarks and demonstrate computational feasibility.  

**Significance**  
This research bridges the adaptability of RL with the rigorous guarantees of control theory, fostering trust in learned policies for safety-critical applications. By addressing the fundamental challenge of stability in RL, the work contributes to the development of resilient autonomous systems and industrial processes.

### 3. **Methodology**  
**Research Design**  
The proposed framework combines constrained policy optimization with neural Lyapunov function learning. Key components include:  

#### **Data Collection**  
- **Simulated Environments**: Use OpenAI Gym’s Pendulum, MuJoCo’s HalfCheetah, and PyBullet’s Kuka robot to collect state-action trajectories.  
- **World Model Integration**: Adopt the self-supervised data generation method from McCutcheon et al. (2025) to sample underrepresented states, ensuring Lyapunov function validity across the entire state space.  
- **Perturbation Injection**: Introduce stochastic noise (e.g., Gaussian disturbances) to states during training to test robustness.  

#### **Algorithm Design**  
1. **Neural Architecture**:  
   - **Policy Network**: A stochastic actor $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ with parameters $\theta$ to map states to actions.  
   - **Lyapunov Network**: A critic $V_\phi(s)$ with parameters $\phi$ to approximate the Lyapunov function.  

2. **Stability Constraints**:  
   The key constraint is the *Lyapunov decay condition*: for all transitions $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$,  
   $$
   V_\phi(s_{t+1}) \leq \gamma V_\phi(s_t) + \ell(s_t, a_t),
   $$  
   where $\gamma \in (0, 1)$ is a discount factor and $\ell(s, a)$ penalizes unsafe states/actions.  

3. **Optimization Formulation**:  
   Use constrained policy gradient methods with a Lagrangian dual:  
   $$
   \max_\theta \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r(s_t, a_t) \right] \quad \text{subject to} \quad \mathbb{E}[V_\phi(s_{t+1}) - \gamma V_\phi(s_t)] \leq 0.
   $$  
   The augmented Lagrangian loss is:  
   $$
   \mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi, \lambda) = -\mathbb{E}[R(\tau)] + \lambda \cdot \mathbb{E}[V_\phi(s_{t+1}) - \gamma V_\phi(s_t)],
   $$  
   where $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier updated via gradient ascent.  

4. **Training Pipeline**:  
   - **Step 1**: Pre-train $V_\phi(s)$ using self-supervised data from a World Model.  
   - **Step 2**: Jointly update $\theta$ (policy) and $\phi$ (Lyapunov) via alternating gradient descent.  
   - **Step 3**: Periodically validate $V_\phi(s)$ on held-out states to ensure global stability.  

#### **Experimental Validation**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against SAC, PPO, and SAC-CLF (Chen et al., 2025).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - *Cumulative Reward*: Task performance.  
  - *Stability Rate*: $\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=0}^T \mathbb{I}(V_\phi(s_{t+1}) \leq \gamma V_\phi(s_t))$.  
  - *Robustness Score*: Performance degradation under injected perturbations.  
  - *Sample Efficiency*: Convergence speed in terms of training episodes.  
- **Benchmarks**:  
  - **Pendulum Swing-Up**: Validate stability under torque perturbations.  
  - **Quadrotor Control**: Test robustness in continuous state-action spaces.  
  - **Chemical Process Simulation**: Evaluate distributed control capabilities (cf. Yao et al., 2024).
