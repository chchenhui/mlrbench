Title: Fidelity-Aware Active Exploration for High-Dimensional Materials Discovery

Motivation: Discovering novel materials with targeted properties (e.g., high conductivity or strength) requires costly, labor-intensive experiments and large computational simulations. Current active learning and experimental‐design methods often ignore multiple fidelity levels (cheap simulations vs. expensive lab tests) and struggle in high-dimensional descriptor spaces, limiting data efficiency and real‐world applicability.

Main Idea: We propose a multi‐fidelity active learning framework that fuses low-cost simulators and high-cost physical assays to accelerate materials discovery. A Deep Kernel Learning Gaussian Process (DKL‐GP) models material descriptors, capturing nonlinear structure in high dimensions. We introduce a fidelity‐aware acquisition function that maximizes expected information gain per unit cost by weighting predictive uncertainty reduction against experiment expense. Domain knowledge from physics‐informed neural nets is encoded as a prior over the DKL kernel to ensure plausible predictions. To balance exploration and exploitation under safety constraints (e.g., avoid unstable chemistries), we integrate a constrained Thompson Sampling strategy that respects toxicity or instability bounds. We evaluate on benchmark conductivity and elasticity datasets, measuring reduction in real‐world assay calls. This approach aims to cut materials discovery time and cost by an order of magnitude, enabling faster deployment of advanced materials in energy, electronics, and aerospace.
