# NeuroGuided Protein Design: Active Learning in Protein Engineering

## Motivation
Protein engineering is crucial for developing new therapeutics, enzymes, and materials. However, traditional methods rely on expensive, time-consuming wet-lab experiments. The protein sequence space is vast (20^N possible sequences for N residues), making exhaustive exploration impossible. Current computational approaches often fail to capture the complex relationship between protein sequence and function. There is an urgent need for more efficient methods to navigate this massive search space and prioritize the most promising candidates for experimental validation.

## Main Idea
We propose NeuroGuided Protein Design, a novel active learning framework that combines deep learning with Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the protein sequence space. Our approach uses a neural network ensemble to model the protein function landscape and uncertainty estimates to guide experimental sampling. The system operates in iterations: (1) training surrogate models on existing data, (2) selecting the next batch of sequences to test using an acquisition function that balances exploration (high uncertainty regions) and exploitation (high predicted function), and (3) incorporating new experimental results to refine the models. A key innovation is our hierarchical representation of proteins that captures both local structural motifs and global folding patterns, enabling the model to transfer knowledge between related proteins and generalize to novel sequences. We expect this approach to reduce experimental iterations by 60-80% compared to traditional methods, dramatically accelerating the discovery of proteins with desired properties.
