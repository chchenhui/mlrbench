**Title:** Physics-Constrained Active Learning for Accelerated Materials Discovery

**Motivation:** Discovering novel materials with desired properties often involves expensive and time-consuming physical experiments or simulations. While active learning, particularly Bayesian Optimization (BO), can guide this search efficiently, it often explores regions of the design space that are physically implausible or violate known scientific principles, leading to wasted resources. Integrating domain-specific physical knowledge is key to making active learning truly practical in scientific discovery.

**Main Idea:** We propose a Physics-Constrained Bayesian Optimization (PC-BO) framework. This framework integrates known physical laws or constraints (e.g., thermodynamic stability, charge neutrality, synthesis feasibility rules) directly into the active learning loop. This can be achieved by: 1) Using physics-informed surrogate models (like constrained Gaussian Processes) that inherently respect these laws. 2) Modifying the acquisition function (e.g., Expected Improvement) to heavily penalize or explicitly exclude candidate points predicted to violate the constraints. The expected outcome is a significant acceleration in discovering *valid* and high-performing materials by focusing experimental effort on physically realistic candidates, thereby reducing experimental cost and time.
