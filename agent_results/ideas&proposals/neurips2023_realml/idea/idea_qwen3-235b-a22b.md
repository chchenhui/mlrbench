# Research Idea: **Knowledge-Guided Deep Bayesian Optimization with Uncertainty-Aware Graph Representations**  

**Motivation**  
In domains like drug design or materials discovery, experimental data are scarce and costly. However, domain experts often possess qualitative knowledge (e.g., molecular structures linked to efficacy) that prior active learning methods fail to integrate rigorously. Bridging this gap could accelerate discovery by reducing redundant experiments while honoring domain-specific constraints.  

**Main Idea**  
We propose a framework that combines *graph neural networks* (GNNs) and *deep Bayesian optimization* (BO) to incorporate domain knowledge into active learning. First, candidate experiments (e.g., molecules) are represented as graphs derived from databases like SMILES strings. Domain-specific knowledge—such as subgraphs validated in literature or expert-defined rules—is encoded as auxiliary edges or node features in a heterogeneous graph. A GNN-variational autoencoder then learns latent representations that prioritize regions of the search space aligning with domain knowledge. These representations are used as input to a scalable deep BO pipeline (e.g., using deep kernel learning or randomized Markov chain Monte Carlo), where acquisition functions balance exploration (e.g., predictive uncertainty) and domain-anchored exploitation (e.g., proximity to known effective substructures). To address multi-fidelity or multi-objective scenarios (e.g., efficacy vs. toxicity), we design an acquisition function that dynamically weights objectives based on prior domain knowledge. The method will be evaluated on real-world tasks, such as optimizing molecule affinity in drug discovery, comparing data efficiency and safety against baselines like random search or standard BO. Expected outcomes include a 2–3× reduction in required experiments versus existing methods, enabling cost-effective, knowledge-enhanced exploration in data-scarce applications like drug design or materials science.
