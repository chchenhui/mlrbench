# HyperPrompt: Dynamic Hyperparameter Adaptation in RL via LLM-Based Meta-Learning

## 1. Introduction

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in various domains, from games and robotics to complex decision-making systems. However, despite these advancements, the application of RL remains constrained by the need for manual hyperparameter tuning, which is often labor-intensive and prone to human error. This process is particularly challenging in novel environments where the optimal hyperparameters are not known a priori.

Recent developments in AutoML and Meta-Learning have shown promise in automating RL, but these approaches often lack real-time adaptability and are limited to offline optimization. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for automating RL, with LLMs demonstrating in-context learning capabilities that can be leveraged for dynamic hyperparameter adjustment.

This research proposes a novel approach, **HyperPrompt**, which employs pretrained LLMs as meta-learners to predict optimal hyperparameter schedules conditioned on real-time environment feedback. By treating hyperparameter adjustment as a partially observable meta-policy, HyperPrompt integrates seamlessly with meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL). This approach aims to reduce manual tuning efforts, improve convergence rates, and enable RL agents to adapt seamlessly to unseen scenarios, thus democratizing RL application.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Research Design

The HyperPrompt framework consists of two main components: a meta-training phase and a deployment phase. During the meta-training phase, the LLM is finetuned on diverse RL tasks to learn to generate context-aware hyperparameter updates. In the deployment phase, the LLM ingests real-time trajectory snippets and outputs hyperparameter updates, which are then applied to the RL agent.

### 2.2 Data Collection

**Meta-Training Data**: A diverse set of RL tasks will be used to train the LLM. These tasks will be selected from open-source RL benchmarks such as DMLab, MuJoCo, and Procgen to ensure a wide range of environments and algorithms. Each task will be paired with its respective hyperparameter configurations and performance metrics.

**Deployment Data**: Real-time trajectory snippets will be collected from the RL agent during deployment. These snippets will include the agent's actions, rewards, and environment states, along with the current hyperparameter settings.

### 2.3 Algorithmic Steps

**Meta-Training**:

1. **Data Preparation**: For each RL task, generate a dataset consisting of trajectories, hyperparameter configurations, and performance metrics. Each dataset will be split into training and validation sets.

2. **Prompt Engineering**: Design prompts that encode the RL task, trajectory, performance metrics, and hyperparameter history. The prompt format will be designed to facilitate the LLM's understanding of the context and its ability to generate relevant hyperparameter updates.

3. **LLM Finetuning**: Train the LLM on the prepared datasets using the designed prompts. The LLM will be optimized to predict optimal hyperparameter schedules conditioned on the input prompts.

**Deployment**:

1. **Real-Time Inference**: During deployment, the LLM will ingest real-time trajectory snippets and generate hyperparameter updates based on the current context.

2. **Hyperparameter Update**: The generated hyperparameter updates will be applied to the RL agent, and the agent will continue training with the updated settings.

3. **Feedback Loop**: The RL agent's performance will be monitored, and the generated hyperparameter updates will be evaluated. The feedback will be used to iteratively refine the LLM's predictions.

### 2.4 Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the HyperPrompt framework, the following metrics will be used:

1. **Convergence Rate**: The time taken for the RL agent to converge to a stable performance level will be measured. A faster convergence rate indicates improved sample efficiency.

2. **Performance Metrics**: The RL agent's performance on the deployment tasks will be evaluated using standard metrics such as average reward, success rate, and episode length. These metrics will be compared against baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of the hyperparameter updates.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The sensitivity of the RL agent's performance to the generated hyperparameter updates will be analyzed. This will involve measuring the impact of small perturbations in the hyperparameters on the agent's performance.

4. **Generalization**: The ability of the HyperPrompt framework to generalize across diverse RL tasks and environments will be evaluated. This will involve testing the framework on a set of unseen tasks and comparing the performance against baseline methods.

### 2.5 Experimental Design

**Procedural Benchmarks**: The HyperPrompt framework will be evaluated on procedurally generated benchmarks such as NetHack and Procgen. These benchmarks will be selected to ensure a wide range of environments and algorithms, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of the framework's generalization capabilities.

**Baseline Methods**: The performance of the HyperPrompt framework will be compared against several baseline methods, including:

- **Hand-Tuned Hyperparameters**: The performance of an RL agent with manually tuned hyperparameters will be used as a baseline for comparison.

- **Offline AutoML Methods**: Methods such as OptFormer, which focus on offline hyperparameter optimization, will be used as baselines to compare the real-time adaptability of the HyperPrompt framework.

- **Random Hyperparameter Updates**: The performance of an RL agent with randomly generated hyperparameter updates will be used as a baseline to assess the effectiveness of the LLM-based meta-learning approach.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

The HyperPrompt framework is expected to yield several key outcomes:

1. **Reduced Manual Tuning Efforts**: By automating dynamic hyperparameter adjustment, the HyperPrompt framework will significantly reduce the need for manual tuning, making RL more accessible to researchers and practitioners with limited expertise.

2. **Improved Convergence Rates**: The real-time adaptability of the HyperPrompt framework will enable RL agents to converge more quickly to stable performance levels, enhancing sample efficiency.

3. **Enhanced Generalization**: The framework's ability to generalize across diverse RL tasks and environments will enable RL agents to adapt seamlessly to unseen scenarios, broadening the applicability of RL.

4. **Standardized Benchmarks**: The development of standardized benchmarks for evaluating AutoRL approaches will facilitate fair comparison and progress in the field. The HyperPrompt framework will contribute to this effort by providing a comprehensive evaluation framework.

5. **Collaboration Across Communities**: By connecting the communities working on RL, Meta-Learning, AutoML, and LLMs, the HyperPrompt framework will foster collaboration and cross-pollination of ideas, ultimately leading to faster and more focused progress on AutoRL.

## 4. Conclusion

The HyperPrompt framework represents a significant advancement in the field of AutoRL, leveraging the power of LLMs to automate dynamic hyperparameter adjustment. By integrating seamlessly with meta-RL, the framework addresses the challenges of real-time adaptability and generalization, making RL more accessible and robust.
