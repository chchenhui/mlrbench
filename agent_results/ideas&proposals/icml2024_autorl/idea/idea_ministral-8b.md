### Title: Meta-Learning Enhanced AutoML for Reinforcement Learning

### Motivation:
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great promise but remains challenging to apply effectively in novel and complex environments. Traditional RL algorithms often require significant manual tuning and domain expertise. Meta-learning and AutoML have the potential to automate and generalize RL, making it more accessible and efficient. However, the integration of these approaches with Large Language Models (LLMs) and their in-context learning capabilities remains underexplored. This research aims to bridge these gaps by developing a meta-learning framework that leverages AutoML techniques and LLMs to automate RL algorithm discovery and adaptation.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research will focus on developing a meta-learning enhanced AutoML framework for RL. This framework will integrate LLMs to enable in-context learning and adaptability, allowing it to discover and optimize RL algorithms automatically. The methodology involves:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather diverse RL datasets to train the meta-learner.
2. **Meta-Learner Architecture**: Design a meta-learner that combines AutoML techniques and LLMs to discover and optimize RL algorithms.
3. **In-Context Learning**: Utilize LLMs to enable the meta-learner to adapt to new tasks and environments with minimal data.
4. **Evaluation and Iteration**: Evaluate the performance of the meta-learner on various RL benchmarks and iteratively refine the architecture and training procedures.

Expected outcomes include:
- A robust meta-learning framework that can automate RL algorithm discovery and adaptation.
- Improved generalization and efficiency in RL across different domains and environments.
- Enhanced interpretability and fairness in RL through feature and hyperparameter importance analysis.

Potential impact:
- This research will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in AutoRL, making RL more accessible and practical.
- The integration of LLMs will open new avenues for in-context learning and adaptability in RL.
- The proposed framework can be extended to other areas of machine learning, promoting broader applicability and impact.
