**Title**  
**Adaptive Inference Computation for Efficient LLM Planning**  

---

### 1. Introduction  

#### Background  
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning and planning tasks, such as sequential decision-making and multi-step problem-solving. However, traditional inference methods rely on fixed computational budgets (e.g., static Chain-of-Thought depth, beam search width), leading to inefficiencies. For instance, computationally demanding reasoning steps (e.g., resolving ambiguities) are often under-resourced, while simpler steps consume excessive resources. This mismatch hinders both efficiency and scalability, particularly in real-time or resource-constrained applications. Recent works like **AdaPlanner** ([1]) and **LLM-DP** ([2]) have explored closed-loop and neuro-symbolic frameworks for adaptive planning, but they focus on domain-specific heuristics or static resource allocation. Others, including **AdaLLaVA** ([3]) and **LLM-RAO** ([4]), introduced resource-aware strategies in multimodal and wireless domains but lack generalization to diverse planning tasks. Dynamic allocation of computational resources using reinforcement learning (RL) and meta-reasoning components ([6]-[9]) has been proposed, yet a unified framework for LLM planning remains elusive.  

#### Research Objectives  
This research aims to design and validate an **Adaptive Inference Planner (AIP)** that dynamically allocates computational resources during LLM planning. Specific objectives include:  
1. **Meta-reasoning for difficulty assessment**: Develop a component to estimate the complexity of sub-goals or reasoning steps using contextual cues (e.g., uncertainty in sub-task feasibility).  
2. **Resource allocation policy**: Create an RL-agent that maps difficulty estimates to computational actions (e.g., increasing Chain-of-Thought depth, invoking specialized tools).  
3. **Efficient training**: Train the AIP through RL with a multi-objective reward balancing solution quality and computational cost.  
4. **Evaluation**: Benchmark the framework on diverse planning tasks, comparing against static baselines in terms of speed, accuracy, and resource adaptability.  

#### Significance  
Addressing this gap will enable LLMs to:  
- **Reduce inference costs** by up to 40% on simple planning tasks without sacrificing accuracy.  
- **Improve performance** on complex tasks by intelligently reallocating resources to critical steps.  
- **Generalize across domains** (e.g., robotics, logistics) through task-agnostic resource allocation logic.  
This aligns with the workshop’s focus on scalable reasoning, efficient inference, and benchmarking, advancing LLMs’ deployment in real-world systems requiring adaptive planning.

### 2. Methodology  

#### System Architecture  
The **AIP** operates as a meta-controller around a base LLM, dynamically adjusting inference parameters based on per-step difficulty (Figure 1). It comprises three components:  
1. **Difficulty Estimator (DE)**: Uses the LLM’s hidden states and task-specific features to quantify sub-step complexity.  
2. **Resource Allocator (RA)**: Maps difficulty scores to discrete actions (e.g., "increase reasoning depth", "use tool Z").  
3. **Policy Learner (PL)**: An RL agent trained to optimize a reward function balancing solution quality and cost.

#### Data Collection  
- **Benchmarks**: Train and evaluate AIP on **ALFWorld** (object interaction tasks), **MiniWoB++** (web interfacing), and **Meta-World** (robot control). These tasks range from low-level action planning to long-horizon reasoning.  
- **Synthetic Complexity**: Augment datasets with artificially generated high- and low-difficulty sub-goals (e.g., nested vs. single-step reasoning) to stress-test allocation strategies.  
- **Human Feedback**: For tasks like **StrategyQA**, use crowd-sourced annotations to validate plan quality.

#### Algorithmic Details  

##### **Difficulty Estimator (DE)**  
Let $ s_t $ denote the state at planning step $ t $, represented by the LLM’s last-layer hidden state $ h_t \in \mathbb{R}^d $ and additional task-specific features (e.g., entropy of the LLM’s action logits). DE computes a difficulty score $ d_t \in [0,1] $:  
$$
d_t = \sigma\left( W_d \cdot \text{MLP}(h_t) + b_d \right)
$$  
where $ \sigma $ is the sigmoid function, $ W_d \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times k} $, and $ \text{MLP} $ projects $ h_t $ into a $ k $-dimensional space.  

##### **Resource Allocator (RA)**  
RA selects an action $ a_t $ from a discrete set $ \mathcal{A} = \{\text{default}, \text{depth+1}, \text{use-tool}, \text{beam+width}\} $, governed by:  
$$
a_t \sim \pi_{\theta}(a_t | d_t)
$$  
where $ \pi_{\theta} $ is a neural policy network parameterized by $ \theta $.  

##### **Policy Learner (PL) Training**  
PL uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a reward function:  
$$
R = Q(\text{plan}) - \lambda C(\text{resources})
$$  
where $ Q(\text{plan}) $ measures plan validity (e.g., 1 if sub-goal achieved, 0 otherwise), $ C(\text{resources}) $ quantifies computational cost (e.g., tokens generated), and $ \lambda $ balances both.  

##### **Training Pipeline**  
1. Pre-train DE on supervised labels from human-annotated difficulty scores.  
2. Train RA + PL using PPO in a simulated environment where AIP solves tasks iteratively.  
3. Fine-tune end-to-end on real-world environments.

#### Experimental Design  
- **Baselines**: Compare against fixed-depth CoT, beam search, and AdaPlanner ([1]).  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Efficiency**: FLOPs, inference speed (steps/second).  
  - **Quality**: Task success rate, number of sub-steps.  
  - **Adaptability**: Correlation between DE estimates and manual difficulty labels.  
- **Ablation Studies**:  
  - Remove DE/RA modules individually to assess their impact.  
  - Vary $ \lambda $ to analyze tradeoffs.
