### Title: Adaptive Inference Computation for Efficient LLM Planning

---

### 1. Introduction

The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities in reasoning, planning, and decision-making. However, the efficiency of these models during inference remains a critical challenge, particularly for complex planning tasks. Current LLMs typically allocate fixed computational resources, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. This research aims to address these challenges by proposing an "Adaptive Inference Planner" (AIP) mechanism integrated within LLMs. The AIP dynamically assesses the difficulty or uncertainty of each planning step and allocates computational resources accordingly, optimizing both efficiency and performance.

#### Research Objectives
1. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Develop a meta-reasoning component within LLMs to assess the complexity of planning steps and allocate computational resources dynamically.
2. **Efficient Planning**: Enhance the efficiency of LLM planning by focusing computational resources on critical steps.
3. **Balanced Performance**: Achieve a balance between computational cost and solution quality, ensuring that simpler tasks are handled efficiently and complex tasks are tackled effectively.
4. **Generalization**: Ensure that the adaptive inference mechanism generalizes across diverse tasks and environments without extensive retraining.

#### Significance
The proposed AIP mechanism has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and performance of LLMs in planning tasks. By dynamically allocating computational resources, it can handle simpler tasks more efficiently and improve performance on complex tasks by focusing computation where it is most needed. This research contributes to the broader theme of enhancing LLM reasoning and planning capabilities, which is a key focus area in the workshop on reasoning and planning for large language models.

### 2. Methodology

#### Research Design
The research design involves the following key components: data collection, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

##### Data Collection
- **Datasets**: We will utilize a diverse set of planning datasets, including ALFWorld, MiniWoB++, and other relevant benchmarks. These datasets will cover a range of task complexities and environments.
- **Annotations**: The datasets will be annotated to include task difficulty levels and potential computational requirements for each step.

##### Model Architecture
- **LLM Base**: We will use a state-of-the-art LLM as the base model, such as OpenAI's o1 model.
- **Adaptive Inference Planner (AIP)**: The AIP will consist of a meta-reasoning component that assesses the difficulty of each planning step and a resource allocation module that adjusts computational resources accordingly.

##### Training
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The AIP will be trained using reinforcement learning, where it is rewarded for achieving planning goals efficiently (balancing solution quality and computational cost).
- **Training Procedure**:
  1. **Initialization**: Initialize the AIP with random parameters.
  2. **Planning Iteration**: For each planning step, the AIP assesses the difficulty and allocates computational resources.
  3. **Reward Calculation**: The reward is calculated based on the planning goal achieved and the computational cost.
  4. **Policy Update**: Update the AIP parameters using the reward signal.
  5. **Iteration**: Repeat steps 2-4 for multiple planning episodes.

##### Mathematical Formulation
The reward function \( R \) can be defined as:
\[ R = \alpha \cdot Q - \beta \cdot C \]
where:
- \( Q \) is the quality of the solution (e.g., distance to the goal in a pathfinding task).
- \( C \) is the computational cost (e.g., number of inference steps or model invocations).
- \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are hyperparameters that balance the trade-off between solution quality and computational cost.

##### Experimental Design
- **Baseline Comparison**: Compare the performance of the AIP with a fixed resource allocation baseline.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the model using metrics such as planning time, solution quality, and computational efficiency.
- **Generalization**: Test the AIP on diverse datasets and tasks to ensure its generalization capabilities.
