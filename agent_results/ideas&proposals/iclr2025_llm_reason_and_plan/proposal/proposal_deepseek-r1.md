**Research Proposal: Adaptive Inference Computation for Efficient LLM Planning**  

---

### **1. Introduction**  

#### **Background**  
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning and planning tasks, yet their computational inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck. Current LLMs allocate fixed computational resources during inference, regardless of task complexity. This "one-size-fits-all" approach leads to inefficient resource usage: overspending on simple sub-tasks and underperforming on complex steps. Recent works, such as AdaPlanner [1] and LLM-DP [2], highlight the need for dynamic resource allocation, while adaptive frameworks like AdaLLaVA [3] and LLM-RAO [4] demonstrate the potential of meta-reasoning in balancing accuracy and computational cost.  

#### **Research Objectives**  
This project proposes an **Adaptive Inference Planner (AIP)** to dynamically allocate computational resources during LLM-based planning tasks. Key objectives include:  
1. Design a meta-reasoning component to assess the difficulty, uncertainty, or criticality of each planning step.  
2. Develop adaptive mechanisms to allocate resources, such as adjusting Chain-of-Thought (CoT) depth, beam search width, or invoking specialized tools.  
3. Train the AIP using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize both task performance and computational efficiency.  
4. Validate the approach on multi-step planning benchmarks (e.g., ALFWorld, MiniWoB++) and quantify the trade-offs between inference speed and solution quality.  

#### **Significance**  
By enabling *variable effort* during inference, AIP addresses a critical limitation of current LLMs. The framework has broad applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and real-time decision-making, where balancing speed and accuracy is paramount. It also advances the theoretical understanding of adaptive computation in neural models, providing insights into meta-reasoning and resource-efficient planning.

### **2. Methodology**  

#### **Research Design**  
The AIP framework consists of two components: a **task planner** (the base LLM) and a **meta-reasoning controller** that dynamically allocates resources.  

**Data Collection:**  
- **Benchmark Tasks:** Use ALFWorld (text-based embodied planning) and MiniWoB++ (web-based task automation) for training and evaluation.  
- **Synthetic Data:** Generate tasks with variable complexity (e.g., easy steps requiring 2–3 actions, hard steps requiring 10+ actions) to train the controller.  

**Architecture:**  
1. **Meta-Reasoning Controller:** A lightweight neural network or a fine-tuned LLM head that estimates the "difficulty score" $d_t$ of the next planning step $t$ based on:  
   - Contextual embeddings of the current state $s_t$  
   - Historical performance metrics (e.g., failure rate for similar steps)  
   $$ d_t = f_\theta(s_t, h_{t-1}), $$  
   where $f_\theta$ is the controller network and $h_{t-1}$ is the hidden state.  
2. **Resource Allocation:** Based on $d_t$, the controller selects a computation mode:  
   - **Minimal Effort (Low $d_t$):** Single inference step, greedy decoding.  
   - **Moderate Effort (Medium $d_t$):** Multi-step CoT (e.g., 3–5 steps).  
   - **High Effort (High $d_t$):** Beam search (width=5) + tool invocation (e.g., code interpreter).  

**Training via Reinforcement Learning:**  
- **Reward Function:** Balance task success and computational cost:  
  $$ R = \alpha \cdot \text{Success} + \beta \cdot \frac{1}{\text{Compute Cost}}, $$  
  where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are tunable weights. Compute cost is measured in FLOPs or inference time.  
- **Policy Optimization:** Use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train the controller, with the base LLM frozen.  

**Experimental Validation:**  
- **Baselines:** Compare against (1) Fixed-Computation LLMs (no adaptation), (2) AdaPlanner [1], (3) LLM-DP [2].  
- **Metrics:**  
  - **Success Rate:** Proportion of tasks solved.  
  - **Inference Time:** Total computation time per task.  
  - **Cost-Adjusted Score:** $S = \text{Success Rate} \times \frac{1}{\text{Inference Time}}$.  
- **Ablation Studies:** Test the impact of individual components (e.g., RL vs. heuristic-based controllers).

### **3. Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

#### **Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Efficiency:** AIP will reduce inference time by 30–50% on simple planning tasks while maintaining comparable success rates.  
2. **Enhanced Performance:** Complex tasks (e.g., ALFWorld cooking scenarios) will see a 15–20% improvement in success rates due to targeted resource allocation.  
3. **Generalization:** The controller will adapt to unseen tasks in the same domain (e.g., new MiniWoB++ tasks) without retraining.  

#### **Broader Impact**  
- **Scalable LLM Applications:** Enable real-time deployment of LLMs in latency-sensitive domains like robotics and autonomous driving.  
- **Resource Efficiency:** Reduce the carbon footprint of LLM inference by minimizing redundant computation.  
- **Foundational Insights:** Advance adaptive computation techniques applicable to multimodal and embodied AI systems.

### **4. Timeline**  
1. **Months 1–3:** Implement the meta-reasoning controller and integrate it with open-source LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral).  
2. **Months 4–6:** Train and evaluate AIP on ALFWorld and MiniWoB++.  
3. **Months 7–9:** Extend to multi-modal tasks (e.g., vision-language planning) and refine the RL training pipeline.  
4. **Months 10–12:** Publish results and release code/model checkpoints.
