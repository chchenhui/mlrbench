# Adaptive Meta-Planning: Dynamic Computational Resource Allocation for Efficient Large Language Model Planning

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning and planning tasks, from solving complex puzzles to generating multi-step strategies for embodied agents. However, the inference process for these models often employs a fixed computational approach regardless of the varying complexity across different planning stages. This "one-size-fits-all" approach leads to significant inefficiencies: computational resources are wasted on simple reasoning steps while complex reasoning challenges may receive insufficient processing power.

Recent advances in LLM-based planning systems have shown promising results. AdaPlanner (Sun et al., 2023) demonstrated how LLMs can refine plans through environmental feedback, while LLM Dynamic Planner (Dagan et al., 2023) successfully combined symbolic planners with LLMs for embodied tasks. Similarly, work on adaptive computation in multimodal contexts (Xu et al., 2025) and resource allocation in wireless environments (Noh et al., 2025) has highlighted the potential benefits of dynamic resource management. Despite these advances, existing research has not fully addressed the challenge of dynamically allocating computational resources during LLM inference based on the varying complexity of planning substeps.

Planning tasks are inherently variable in their computational requirements. For instance, when an LLM plans a multi-step solution to a problem, certain steps might involve straightforward decision-making (e.g., "pick up the red block") while others demand complex causal reasoning (e.g., determining which sequence of actions will unblock a path). Current inference mechanisms are unable to distinguish between these different computational needs, leading to inefficient resource allocation and suboptimal planning performance.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

This research proposes Adaptive Meta-Planning (AMP), a novel framework for enhancing planning efficiency in LLMs through dynamic computational resource allocation. The primary objectives of this research are:

1. To develop a meta-reasoning component that can effectively assess the complexity and uncertainty of individual planning steps within an LLM planning process.

2. To design and implement an adaptive computation mechanism that dynamically allocates computational resources based on the assessed complexity of planning steps.

3. To train this adaptive system using reinforcement learning, optimizing for both planning effectiveness and computational efficiency.

4. To evaluate the proposed framework across diverse planning domains, demonstrating improvements in both computational efficiency and planning quality.

### 1.3 Significance

The significance of this research extends across several dimensions:

**Theoretical Advancement**: This work advances our understanding of meta-reasoning within LLMs, exploring how models can become aware of their own uncertainty and reasoning challenges.

**Practical Efficiency**: By optimizing computational resource allocation, AMP can significantly reduce inference costs for LLM planning tasks, making these systems more economically viable for real-world applications.

**Planning Performance**: Dynamic resource allocation allows models to devote more computation to challenging planning steps, potentially improving overall planning quality for complex tasks.

**Scalability**: As LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient inference becomes increasingly critical. This research provides a pathway toward more scalable LLM planning systems.

**Broader Applications**: While focused on planning, the principles of adaptive computation developed in this research may extend to other reasoning-intensive LLM applications, including causal inference, scientific discovery, and strategic decision-making.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Overview of Adaptive Meta-Planning Framework

The Adaptive Meta-Planning (AMP) framework consists of four main components:

1. **Base LLM Planning System**: A foundation LLM capable of generating plans through techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.

2. **Complexity Assessment Module (CAM)**: A meta-reasoning component that evaluates the difficulty or uncertainty of each planning step.

3. **Resource Allocation Controller (RAC)**: A mechanism that dynamically determines the computational resources to allocate based on the CAM's assessment.

4. **Learning Optimizer**: A reinforcement learning system that trains the CAM and RAC to optimize the balance between computational efficiency and planning performance.

Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of the AMP framework:

                                                                                              ↑
                              [Learning Optimizer (Reinforcement Learning)] ⟲ [Environment Feedback]
```

### 2.2 Complexity Assessment Module (CAM)

The CAM evaluates the difficulty of each planning step by analyzing:

1. **Model Uncertainty**: The entropy of the next-token distribution, indicating the model's uncertainty.
2. **Step Complexity Indicators**: Linguistic markers that suggest complex reasoning (e.g., causal conjunctions, hypotheticals).
3. **Goal-State Distance**: Estimated distance to goal achievement based on current planning state.

For a given planning state $s$ and partial plan $p$, the complexity score $C(s, p)$ is computed as:

$$C(s, p) = \alpha \cdot H(P(x|s,p)) + \beta \cdot I(s,p) + \gamma \cdot D(s,p)$$

Where:
- $H(P(x|s,p))$ is the entropy of the next-token distribution
- $I(s,p)$ is a function that detects complexity indicators in the current context
- $D(s,p)$ is the estimated goal-state distance
- $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are weighting parameters learned during training

### 2.3 Resource Allocation Controller (RAC)

Based on the complexity score from the CAM, the RAC determines which computational resources to allocate. These resources include:

1. **Inference Depth**: Number of reasoning steps (e.g., CoT depth)
2. **Sampling Parameters**: Temperature, top-p, and beam width
3. **Tool Usage**: Whether to invoke specialized external tools or models
4. **Verification Steps**: Whether to allocate resources for self-verification

The resource allocation function maps complexity scores to resource configurations:

$$R(C) = \{d, t, p, b, u, v\}$$

Where:
- $d$ is the inference depth
- $t$ is the sampling temperature
- $p$ is the top-p value
- $b$ is the beam search width
- $u$ is a binary vector indicating which tools to use
- $v$ is the level of verification

The mapping function is implemented as a parameterized policy network $\pi_\theta(R|C)$ that is trained through reinforcement learning.

### 2.4 Learning Optimizer

The Learning Optimizer trains the CAM and RAC using reinforcement learning. For each planning task, the reward function balances planning effectiveness against computational cost:

$$Reward = \lambda \cdot PlanningSuccess - (1-\lambda) \cdot ComputationalCost$$

Where:
- $PlanningSuccess$ is a binary or continuous measure of plan quality
- $ComputationalCost$ is normalized computational resource usage
- $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter balancing these objectives

The policy is optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with the following objective:

$$L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \hat{E}_t\left[\min(r_t(\theta)\hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)\hat{A}_t)\right]$$

Where:
- $r_t(\theta)$ is the probability ratio $\frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}$
- $\hat{A}_t$ is the estimated advantage
- $\epsilon$ is a hyperparameter typically set to 0.2

### 2.5 Implementation Details

The AMP framework will be implemented as follows:

1. **Base Models**: We will use state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, Claude, or Llama-2 as the base planning models.

2. **CAM Implementation**: The CAM will be implemented as a lightweight neural network that takes as input the hidden states of the base LLM along with features extracted from the current planning context.

3. **RAC Implementation**: The RAC will be implemented as a policy network that maps complexity scores to discrete and continuous resource allocation decisions.

4. **Training Procedure**:
   a. Pre-training: Initial training of the CAM using supervised learning on human-annotated examples of planning step complexity
   b. RL Fine-tuning: End-to-end training using PPO with online evaluation in planning environments
   c. Curriculum Learning: Gradually increasing the difficulty of planning tasks during training

### 2.6 Benchmarks and Evaluation

We will evaluate AMP on the following benchmarks:

1. **ALFWorld**: A suite of embodied planning tasks in household environments
2. **BabyAI**: A platform for evaluating instruction following and planning
3. **WebShop**: An e-commerce environment requiring multi-step planning
4. **GSM8K**: Mathematical planning problems requiring sequential reasoning

Evaluation metrics will include:

1. **Planning Success Rate**: Percentage of tasks completed successfully
2. **Computational Efficiency**: Measured by total inference FLOPs or token consumption
3. **Performance-Efficiency Curve**: Plot of success rate against computational resources
4. **Adaptivity Effectiveness**: Correlation between allocated resources and actual step complexity

### 2.7 Ablation Studies

We will conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component:

1. Comparing AMP to fixed-computation baselines with equivalent average resource usage
2. Evaluating different complexity assessment features and methods
3. Testing various resource allocation strategies
4. Analyzing the impact of different reward formulations in the RL training
5. Comparing direct complexity assessment versus learned assessment

## 3. Methodology Details

### 3.1 Algorithm for Adaptive Meta-Planning

The complete algorithm for Adaptive Meta-Planning is presented below:

```
Algorithm: Adaptive Meta-Planning (AMP)

Input: Planning task T, base LLM M, initial state s₀, goal state g
Output: Plan p, computational resource usage u

Initialize:
  p ← ∅
  s ← s₀

While s ≠ g and not timeout:
  // Assess step complexity
  c ← CAM(M, s, p)
  
  // Determine resource allocation
  r ← RAC(c)
  
  // Extract components of resource allocation
  d, t, top_p, b, tools, v ← r
  
  // Execute planning step with allocated resources
  next_step ← ExecuteWithResources(M, s, p, d, t, top_p, b, tools)
  
  // Optional verification if allocated
  if v > threshold:
    next_step ← VerifyAndRefine(M, s, p, next_step)
  
  // Update plan and state
  p ← p ∪ {next_step}
  s ← Execute(s, next_step)
  
  // Track resource usage
  u ← u + ResourceCost(r)

Return p, u
```

### 3.2 Complexity Assessment Implementation Details

The CAM evaluates planning step complexity using both model-derived and context-derived features:

**Model-derived features**:
- Entropy of next-token distribution: $H(P(x|s,p)) = -\sum_{x} P(x|s,p) \log P(x|s,p)$
- Perplexity on current context
- KL divergence between prior and posterior distributions

**Context-derived features**:
- Presence of reasoning indicators (e.g., "because", "however", "if-then")
- Number of entities and relationships in current context
- Syntactic complexity measures (e.g., tree depth)

These features are combined using a neural network:

$$C(s, p) = \text{NN}_\phi(f_1, f_2, ..., f_n)$$

Where $f_i$ represents the individual features and $\text{NN}_\phi$ is a neural network with parameters $\phi$.

### 3.3 Resource Allocation Strategy

The RAC maps complexity scores to specific resource allocations following these principles:

1. **Depth Allocation**: For complex steps, increase reasoning depth:
   $$d = d_{\min} + (d_{\max} - d_{\min}) \cdot \sigma(w_d \cdot c + b_d)$$
   where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, and $w_d$, $b_d$ are learned parameters.

2. **Sampling Control**: For uncertain steps, decrease temperature and/or increase beam width:
   $$t = t_{\max} - (t_{\max} - t_{\min}) \cdot \sigma(w_t \cdot c + b_t)$$
   $$b = b_{\min} + (b_{\max} - b_{\min}) \cdot \sigma(w_b \cdot c + b_b)$$

3. **Tool Selection**: Determine which specialized tools to use based on complexity:
   $$P(u_i = 1) = \sigma(w_i \cdot c + b_i)$$
   where $u_i$ represents the use of the $i$-th tool.

4. **Verification Level**: Determine the extent of verification:
   $$v = v_{\min} + (v_{\max} - v_{\min}) \cdot \sigma(w_v \cdot c + b_v)$$

### 3.4 Training Details

The training process involves the following steps:

1. **Supervised Pre-training**: 
   - Collect human annotations of planning step complexity
   - Train CAM using MSE loss between predicted and annotated complexity

2. **RL Training**:
   - Environment: Planning benchmarks (ALFWorld, BabyAI, etc.)
   - State: Current planning state and partial plan
   - Action: Resource allocation decisions
   - Reward: $\lambda \cdot PlanSuccess - (1-\lambda) \cdot NormalizedComputationalCost$
   - Optimization: PPO with clipped objective
   - Hyperparameters:
     - Learning rate: 3e-5
     - Batch size: 64
     - PPO epochs: 4
     - Discount factor $\gamma$: 0.99
     - GAE parameter $\lambda$: 0.95
     - Clipping parameter $\epsilon$: 0.2

3. **Curriculum Learning**:
   - Start with simple planning tasks
   - Gradually increase task difficulty
   - Adjust $\lambda$ to emphasize efficiency more as training progresses
