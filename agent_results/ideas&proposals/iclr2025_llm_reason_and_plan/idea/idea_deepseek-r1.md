**Title:** Hierarchical Adaptive Computation for Efficient LLM Reasoning  

**Motivation:** As LLMs tackle increasingly complex reasoning tasks, uniform computational allocation during inference becomes inefficient. Current models expend fixed resources regardless of problem difficulty, leading to wasted computation on simple queries and insufficient depth for hard ones. This research addresses the critical need for dynamic, context-aware resource allocation to balance accuracy and efficiency.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a two-stage hierarchical framework where a lightweight "planner" module first assesses input complexity and dynamically routes tasks to appropriate computational pathways. For simpler queries, a shallow network generates immediate responses; for complex tasks, a deeper, resource-intensive reasoning module is activated. The planner is trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize a reward function combining correctness, latency, and computational cost. To enable fine-grained control, we introduce a sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts architecture with RL-trainable gating, allowing adaptive layer-wise computation. Expected outcomes include 30-50% faster inference on average while maintaining accuracy on benchmarks like GSM8K and HotpotQA. This approach could democratize LLM deployment in latency-sensitive applications (e.g., robotics, real-time tutoring) while maintaining robustness on challenging reasoning tasks.
