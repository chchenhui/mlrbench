**Title:** Adaptive Inference Computation for Efficient LLM Planning

**Motivation:** Complex planning tasks often require variable computational effort depending on the problem stage or complexity. Current LLMs typically use fixed computational resources during inference, leading to inefficiency (overspending on simple steps) or poor performance (underspending on hard steps). Dynamic resource allocation is crucial for scalable and effective LLM planning.

**Main Idea:** We propose an "Adaptive Inference Planner" (AIP) mechanism integrated within LLMs. During planning, the AIP meta-reasoning component assesses the estimated difficulty or uncertainty of the next required planning step (e.g., predicting sub-goal feasibility, evaluating alternative actions). Based on this assessment, it dynamically allocates computational resources, such as invoking more inference steps (like Chain-of-Thought depth), employing specialist tool-use models, or increasing beam search width. Training involves reinforcement learning where the AIP is rewarded for achieving planning goals efficiently (balancing solution quality and computational cost). Expected outcomes are significantly faster inference for simpler planning tasks and improved performance on complex ones by focusing computation where it's most needed.
