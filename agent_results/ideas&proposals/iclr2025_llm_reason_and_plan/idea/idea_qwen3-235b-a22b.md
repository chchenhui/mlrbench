**1. Title:**  
**DynaBench: Adversarial Task Generation for Dynamic Reasoning and Planning Evaluation in LLMs**  

**2. Motivation:**  
Current benchmarks for evaluating LLM reasoning and planning often rely on static, predefined tasks, which fail to capture the dynamic, evolving nature of real-world problems. This limits progress in developing models that adapt to novel, complex scenarios. A dynamic, adversarial benchmarking framework is needed to rigorously test and improve LLMs' ability to handle long-horizon reasoning, resource allocation, and multi-step planning under uncertainty.  

**3. Main Idea:**  
We propose **DynaBench**, a framework that uses a **generative adversarial approach** to dynamically create reasoning and planning tasks. A "generator" LLM designs tasks (e.g., multi-step puzzles, resource allocation problems) tailored to challenge a "target" LLM, while a "discriminator" LLM evaluates the target's solutions for correctness, efficiency, and robustness. The generator and discriminator are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to iteratively produce harder tasks and sharper evaluations, respectively. The target LLM is fine-tuned using feedback from the discriminator and in-context learning to improve its planning strategies. Key innovations include:  
- **Dynamic task complexity scaling** based on the target model's performance.  
- **Multi-objective metrics** (e.g., plan optimality, adaptability to task drift, uncertainty handling).  
- **Cross-domain generalization** via synthetic task generation spanning logistics, games, and causal reasoning.  

Expected outcomes: A self-improving benchmark that exposes weaknesses in current LLMs (e.g., myopic planning, overfitting to static data) and drives advancements in efficient, robust reasoning. Impact: Standardizing dynamic evaluation for LLMs, enabling progress toward real-world deployment in unpredictable environments.
