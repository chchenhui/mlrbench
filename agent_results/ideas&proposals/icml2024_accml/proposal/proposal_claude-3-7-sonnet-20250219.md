# ActiveLoop: A Resource-Efficient Active Learning Framework for Iterative Fine-Tuning of Biological Foundation Models

## 1. Introduction

Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have led to the development of powerful foundation models that demonstrate remarkable capabilities across various biological domains, including protein function prediction, gene expression analysis, and drug discovery. These models, pre-trained on vast amounts of biological data, can capture complex patterns and relationships that are critical for scientific discovery. However, despite their potential, there exists a significant gap between state-of-the-art ML research and practical application in biological laboratories and clinical settings.

The primary barriers to adoption include computational resource constraints, as most biological laboratories lack access to the extensive GPU clusters required for training and fine-tuning large models. Additionally, current foundation models rarely adapt efficiently to new experimental data in an iterative manner, limiting their utility in discovery-oriented research environments. Furthermore, many existing ML systems fail to provide intuitive interfaces for non-ML experts, making them inaccessible to domain scientists who could benefit most from these tools.

We propose ActiveLoop, a novel framework designed to address these challenges by enabling an efficient "lab-in-the-loop" approach to biological discovery. ActiveLoop combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques with active learning strategies and knowledge distillation to create a resource-efficient system that can iteratively incorporate experimental feedback. Our approach enables biological laboratories with modest computational resources to leverage the power of foundation models while maintaining a continuous cycle of prediction, experimentation, and model refinement.

The core objectives of this research are to:
1. Develop a modular, computationally efficient framework for fine-tuning biological foundation models using limited hardware resources
2. Design uncertainty-aware active learning strategies that intelligently guide experimental exploration and maximize information gain
3. Implement knowledge distillation techniques to create compact, deployable models tailored to specific research questions
4. Create an accessible interface that facilitates seamless interaction between computational predictions and wet-lab experimentation

By addressing these objectives, ActiveLoop aims to democratize access to advanced ML methods in biology, accelerate the pace of scientific discovery through iterative refinement, and enhance the alignment between computational predictions and experimental realities. This framework represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between cutting-edge ML research and practical biological applications.

## 2. Methodology

ActiveLoop is designed as a comprehensive framework consisting of three main components: (1) parameter-efficient fine-tuning, (2) uncertainty-based active learning, and (3) knowledge distillation. These components are integrated within a cloud-based interface that manages the workflow between computational predictions and experimental validation. Below, we detail each component and their interactions.

### 2.1 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Biological Foundation Models

The first component addresses the computational efficiency challenge by implementing lightweight adaptation methods for foundation models.

**Foundation Model Selection**: Our framework supports various pre-trained biological foundation models, including protein language models (e.g., ESM-2, ProtBERT), genomic models (e.g., Enformer), and multi-modal biomedical models. The selection depends on the specific biological task.

**Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: We employ LoRA to enable efficient fine-tuning by introducing trainable low-rank decomposition matrices to the attention layers of the foundation model:

$$\Delta W = BA$$

where $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ and $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$ are low-rank matrices with rank $r \ll \min(d, k)$. The original weights $W_0$ are frozen, and only the low-rank matrices are updated during fine-tuning:

$$W = W_0 + \Delta W = W_0 + BA$$

The forward pass becomes:

$$h = W_0x + BAx$$

This approach reduces the number of trainable parameters from $d \times k$ to $r \times (d + k)$, enabling fine-tuning on modest hardware while preserving model performance.

**Adapter Modules**: In addition to LoRA, we implement task-specific adapter modules that can be inserted between layers of the foundation model. Each adapter consists of a down-projection followed by an up-projection with a residual connection:

$$h_{out} = h_{in} + f(W_{up} \cdot \text{ReLU}(W_{down} \cdot h_{in}))$$

where $W_{down} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times b}$ reduces the dimension from $d$ to bottleneck dimension $b$, and $W_{up} \in \mathbb{R}^{b \times d}$ projects back to the original dimension.

**Early Pruning Strategy**: To further optimize efficiency, we implement an early pruning strategy during fine-tuning that identifies and eliminates redundant parameters:

1. Compute importance scores for parameters based on magnitude and gradient information:
   $$S(W_{ij}) = |W_{ij}| \cdot \left|\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_{ij}}\right|$$

2. Prune parameters with scores below a threshold $\tau$:
   $$\hat{W}_{ij} = \begin{cases} 
   W_{ij} & \text{if } S(W_{ij}) \geq \tau \\
   0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}$$

3. Apply gradual pruning schedule that increases sparsity over training iterations.

### 2.2 Uncertainty-Driven Active Learning for Experiment Selection

The second component focuses on intelligently selecting experiments to maximize information gain while minimizing experimental costs.

**Uncertainty Quantification**: We implement multiple approaches to estimate predictive uncertainty:

1. **Monte Carlo Dropout**: By enabling dropout during inference and performing multiple forward passes, we approximate Bayesian posterior sampling:
   $$\mathbb{V}[y] \approx \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} f_{\theta}(x)^2 - \left(\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} f_{\theta}(x)\right)^2$$

2. **Deep Ensembles**: We train an ensemble of $M$ models with different initializations and compute variance across predictions:
   $$\mathbb{V}[y] = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} (f_{\theta_m}(x) - \bar{f}(x))^2$$
   where $\bar{f}(x) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} f_{\theta_m}(x)$

3. **Evidential Networks**: For regression tasks, we model aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty using evidential deep learning, which predicts the parameters of a distribution rather than point estimates:
   $$p(y|x,\omega) = \int p(y|\theta)p(\theta|x,\omega)d\theta$$

**Acquisition Functions**: Based on the uncertainty estimates, we employ various acquisition functions to select the most informative experiments:

1. **Expected Improvement (EI)** for optimization tasks:
   $$\text{EI}(x) = \mathbb{E}[\max(f(x) - f(x^+), 0)]$$
   where $f(x^+)$ is the best observed value.

2. **Entropy-based** acquisition for classification:
   $$H(x) = -\sum_{c=1}^{C} p(y=c|x) \log p(y=c|x)$$

3. **BALD (Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement)**:
   $$\text{BALD}(x) = H(y|x) - \mathbb{E}_{p(\theta|\mathcal{D})}[H(y|x,\theta)]$$

4. **Batch Acquisition**: To enable parallel experimentation, we implement batch acquisition using determinantal point processes (DPPs) to ensure diversity:
   $$P(S) \propto \det(L_S)$$
   where $L_S$ is the kernel matrix restricted to subset $S$.

**Experimental Design**: The system manages experiment prioritization through:

1. Ranking candidate experiments according to the acquisition function
2. Accounting for experimental constraints (cost, time, feasibility)
3. Providing detailed protocols for wet-lab execution
4. Tracking experiment status and results

### 2.3 Knowledge Distillation for Deployment Efficiency

The third component focuses on compressing the fine-tuned model for efficient deployment.

**Teacher-Student Framework**: After each round of fine-tuning, we distill knowledge from the adapted foundation model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student):

$$\mathcal{L}_{KD} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{CE}(y, \sigma(z_s)) + (1-\alpha) \tau^2 \mathcal{L}_{KL}(\sigma(z_s/\tau), \sigma(z_t/\tau))$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{CE}$ is the cross-entropy loss, $\mathcal{L}_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, $\sigma$ is the softmax function, $z_s$ and $z_t$ are the logits from student and teacher models respectively, $\tau$ is the temperature parameter, and $\alpha$ balances the two loss terms.

**Feature Distillation**: In addition to logit-based distillation, we implement feature-level distillation:

$$\mathcal{L}_{FD} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left\| \frac{F_t^i}{||F_t^i||_2} - \frac{F_s^i}{||F_s^i||_2} \right\|_2^2$$

where $F_t^i$ and $F_s^i$ are the feature representations from teacher and student models.

**Quantization**: We further optimize the student model through post-training quantization:

1. Weight quantization to 8-bit or 4-bit precision
2. Activation quantization with calibration
3. Mixed-precision quantization for critical layers

**Model Compression Pipeline**:
1. Train student model using distillation
2. Apply quantization
3. Optimize inference runtime for target hardware
4. Validate against original model performance
