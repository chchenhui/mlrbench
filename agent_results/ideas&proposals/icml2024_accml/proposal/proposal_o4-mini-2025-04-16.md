Title  
ActiveLoop: Lab-in-the-Loop Active Fine-Tuning of Biological Foundation Models for Resource-Efficient Discovery  

Introduction  
Background  
Recent advances in large foundation models—such as protein language models and single-cell expression transformers—have shown remarkable power for predicting molecular properties, guiding protein engineering, and forecasting drug responses. However, the computational and methodological barriers to deploying these models in typical wet-lab environments remain formidable. Training or fine-tuning gigabyte-scale networks often requires multi-node GPU clusters, and non-expert users struggle to integrate model outputs into experimental workflows. Moreover, static models lack the ability to rapidly adapt to new experimental data, slowing the iterative “predict–test–update” cycle that drives biological discovery.  

Research Objectives  
ActiveLoop aims to bridge this gap by developing:  
1. A parameter- and compute-efficient fine-tuning module based on low-rank adapters that can be trained on a single GPU.  
2. A Bayesian active learning engine to select the most informative wet-lab experiments via uncertainty quantification.  
3. A knowledge-distillation pipeline to compress the updated model into a deployable student network.  
4. A cloud-based orchestration framework that integrates prediction, experiment tracking, and asynchronous model updates, enabling iterative lab-in-the-loop refinement.  

Significance  
By dramatically reducing GPU hours and wet-lab cost per iteration, ActiveLoop democratizes foundation-model-driven discovery, empowering labs with modest computational budgets. The framework aligns predictive uncertainty with experimental design, accelerating hypothesis-driven research in protein engineering, drug discovery, and other molecular sciences.  

Methodology  
1. Overview  
ActiveLoop consists of three core components (Figure 1):  
• Adapter-Based Fine-Tuning  
• Bayesian Active Learning  
• Knowledge Distillation & Deployment  
A serverless cloud interface orchestrates data flow between these modules and the wet lab.  

2. Data Collection and Preprocessing  
We will validate ActiveLoop on two representative applications:  
A. Protein Stability Optimization – using the ProTherm database (∼25 000 enzyme variants with measured ΔΔG values).  
B. Single-Cell Drug Response – leveraging a subset of the Perturb-Seq dataset (∼10 000 single-cell profiles across multiple drug treatments).  
Raw inputs (amino-acid sequences or gene expression vectors) will be tokenized and embedded by a pre-trained foundation model (e.g., ProtBERT for proteins, scBERT for single cells).  

3. Adapter-Based Fine-Tuning  
We adopt a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) strategy. Given a pre-trained weight matrix $$W_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k},$$ we parameterize the fine-tuning update as  
$$W = W_0 + \Delta W,\quad \Delta W = A B,$$  
where $A\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times r}$ and $B\in\mathbb{R}^{r\times k}$, and $r\ll \min(d,k)$. Only $A$ and $B$ are trainable, reducing parameter count from $dk$ to $r(d+k)$.  

Fine-tuning procedure:  
Step 1: Initialize $A,B$ with small random values.  
Step 2: For each mini-batch $(x_i,y_i)$, compute loss $$\mathcal{L}_{\rm task} = \frac1N\sum_i\ell(f_{W}(x_i),y_i)\,, $$ where $\ell$ is mean squared error for stability or cross-entropy for classification.  
Step 3: Update $A,B$ via Adam optimizer with learning rate $\eta_{\rm adapter}$.  
Step 4: Repeat for $T_{\rm adapter}$ epochs, monitoring validation performance to prevent overfitting.  

4. Bayesian Active Learning  
To decide which wet-lab experiment to conduct next, we quantify predictive uncertainty with Monte Carlo Dropout or ensemble sampling.  

Acquisition function – BALD (Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement):  
Given a candidate input $x^*$, we estimate mutual information between model predictions and parameters:  
$$\mathrm{MI}(x^*) = H\big[p(y\mid x^*,\mathcal{D})\big] - \mathbb{E}_{\theta\sim p(\theta\mid \mathcal{D})}\big[H\big[p(y\mid x^*,\theta)\big]\big].$$  
In practice, we draw $M$ stochastic forward passes $\{p_m(y\mid x^*)\}$ and approximate:  
$$\hat{H}\big[p(y\mid x^*)\big] = -\sum_{c} \bar{p}_c\log \bar{p}_c,\quad \bar{p}_c = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M p_m(y=c\mid x^*),$$  
$$\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M \Big(-\sum_{c}p_m(y=c\mid x^*)\log p_m(y=c\mid x^*)\Big).$$  
We rank a pool of $K$ candidate variants or perturbations by $\mathrm{MI}(x)$ and select the top $B$ within the lab’s budget.  

5. Wet-Lab Experimentation  
The selected candidates are synthesized and assayed for the target property (e.g., ΔΔG measurement or cell viability). Experimental results $y_{\rm wet}$ are recorded in the cloud database.  

6. Asynchronous Adapter Update  
New labeled data $\{(x_{\rm wet},y_{\rm wet})\}$ are fetched periodically. We fine-tune adapters further, initializing from previous adapter weights to warm-start. This continual learning step uses the same loss $\mathcal{L}_{\rm task}$ but with a smaller learning rate and early stopping to prevent catastrophic forgetting.  

7. Knowledge Distillation & Model Compression  
After each active loop iteration, the updated “teacher” model (foundation model + adapters) is distilled into a compact “student” network.  

Distillation loss:  
$$\mathcal{L}_{\rm distill} = \alpha\,\mathcal{L}_{\rm CE}(f_{\rm student}(x),y_{\rm wet}) + (1-\alpha)\,\mathrm{KL}\big(p_{\rm teacher}(y\mid x)\;\|\;p_{\rm student}(y\mid x)\big),$$  
where $\mathrm{KL}$ is the Kullback–Leibler divergence, and $\alpha\in[0,1]$ balances supervised and distillation terms. The student uses fewer Transformer layers or a shallower MLP architecture to fit on a single GPU or CPU.  

8. Cloud-Based Orchestration  
We implement a web interface and RESTful API that allows non-expert users to:  
• Upload candidate pools and view ranking by uncertainty.  
• Track experiments, import wet-lab results.  
• Monitor fine-tuning progress (loss curves, performance metrics).  
• Download the latest student model for local deployment.  

9. Experimental Validation  
We design two evaluation tracks:  

A. Simulated Active Learning  
– Use held-out labels from ProTherm and Perturb-Seq as oracle.  
– Compare ActiveLoop to baselines: random sampling, uncertainty sampling without adapter freezing, full model fine-tuning, and zero-adaptation.  
– Metrics: predictive accuracy (RMSE, Pearson’s $r$, AUC), number of labeled examples needed to reach target performance, GPU hours consumed per iteration, model size (parameters & memory), inference latency.  

B. Real-World Lab Collaboration  
– Partner with a protein engineering lab.  
– Task: optimize enzyme thermal stability across 3–5 active learning cycles with budget $B=20$ variants per cycle.  
– Baselines: static pre-trained model, LoRA fine-tuning without active learning, ActiveLoop without distillation.  
– Metrics: wet-lab cost (# assays), improvement in stability, time to achieve a benchmark ΔΔG, user satisfaction survey.  

Evaluation Metrics  
– Predictive performance: RMSE, Spearman correlation, accuracy or AUC as appropriate.  
– Efficiency: GPU hours per adapter update, wall-clock time for model update, memory footprint.  
– Label efficiency: number of experiments to reach 95% of maximum performance.  
– Deployment footprint: student model size (MB), CPU inference time (ms per sample).  

Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Outcomes  
1. A fully documented open-source codebase implementing ActiveLoop with tutorials, enabling labs to plug in their foundation model and assay pipeline.  
2. Empirical validation showing a 5× reduction in GPU hours and 40% fewer wet-lab assays compared to naïve fine-tuning.  
3. Demonstration of real-world lab success in enzyme stability optimization, reaching target performance in fewer than 100 total assays.  
4. A peer-reviewed publication benchmarking ActiveLoop against state-of-the-art adapter-based fine-tuning (Maleki et al. 2024; Zhan et al. 2024) and active learning frameworks (Doe et al. 2023; Brown et al. 2023).  

Impact  
• Democratization of ML-driven discovery: By slashing computational and experimental costs, ActiveLoop enables small labs and clinics to adopt foundation models for hypothesis-driven research.  
• Accelerated iterative science: The lab-in-the-loop paradigm—predicting, testing, and updating in days instead of months—promises to shorten the cycle from idea to insight.  
• Generalizability: While demonstrated on proteins and single cells, the modular pipeline applies to other modalities (e.g., small-molecule design, CRISPR screens).  
• Community resource: An extensible cloud platform and distilled model zoo will foster collaboration between ML researchers and experimental biologists.  

Conclusion  
ActiveLoop unites efficient adapter-based fine-tuning, Bayesian active learning, and knowledge distillation in a cloud-orchestrated lab-in-the-loop system. By co-designing computational and experimental workflows, we aim to close the gap between powerful foundation models and hands-on biological discovery, ushering in a new era of accessible, rapid, and cost-effective ML-guided science.
