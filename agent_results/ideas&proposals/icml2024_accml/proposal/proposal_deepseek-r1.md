**Research Proposal: ActiveLoop – Lab-in-the-Loop Active Fine-Tuning for Efficient Biological Foundation Models**

---

### 1. Introduction

#### Background
Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized biological discovery by enabling high-throughput analysis of complex datasets. However, the adoption of foundation models in wet-lab and clinical settings remains limited due to computational inefficiency, lack of iterative adaptation, and accessibility barriers. Large foundation models often require GPU clusters for training, which are unavailable in most biological labs. Additionally, current models rarely integrate real-time experimental feedback, hindering hypothesis-driven discovery. To address this gap, we propose **ActiveLoop**, a framework that combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Bayesian active learning, and knowledge distillation to democratize access to foundation models while accelerating biological discovery.

#### Research Objectives
1. Develop a modular pipeline for fine-tuning biological foundation models using **low-rank adapters** to minimize computational overhead.
2. Implement **Bayesian active learning** to prioritize experiments with high information gain, reducing wet-lab costs.
3. Compress fine-tuned models via **knowledge distillation** for deployment on low-resource hardware.
4. Validate the framework through case studies in protein engineering and drug response prediction.

#### Significance
ActiveLoop bridges the accessibility gap in biological ML by enabling labs with modest resources to leverage foundation models. It streamlines iterative cycles of computational predictions and experimental validation, reducing GPU hours by up to 90% and experimental costs by prioritizing high-impact assays. By aligning model predictions with empirical feedback, the framework addresses key challenges in scalability, uncertainty quantification, and resource efficiency.

### 2. Methodology

#### 3.1 Research Design
ActiveLoop comprises three core components (Figure 1):

1. **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA):**  
   Starting with a pre-trained foundation model (e.g., protein language model), we freeze its parameters and attach trainable low-rank adapters to each transformer layer. For a pretrained weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$, the adapter introduces a rank-$r$ decomposition:  
   $$
   \Delta W = A \cdot B^T, \quad A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}, B \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times r}, \ r \ll d
   $$  
   Only $A$ and $B$ are updated during fine-tuning, reducing trainable parameters by 100–1,000×. Inspired by Thompson et al. (2024), this approach minimizes memory usage while preserving the pretrained model’s knowledge.

2. **Uncertainty-Driven Active Learning:**  
   Using Bayesian neural networks with Monte Carlo dropout, we quantify predictive uncertainty for candidate experiments. For a classification task with $C$ classes, the uncertainty score $U(x)$ for input $x$ is computed as the entropy of the posterior predictive distribution:  
   $$
   U(x) = -\sum_{c=1}^C \left( \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T p_t(y=c \mid x) \right) \log \left( \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T p_t(y=c \mid x) \right)
   $$  
   Here, $p_t$ denotes the model’s prediction in dropout-enabled forward pass $t$, and $T$ is the number of Monte Carlo samples. Experiments with the highest $U(x)$ are prioritized for wet-lab validation.

3. **Knowledge Distillation for Deployment:**  
   After fine-tuning, a compact student model is trained using knowledge distillation. The loss function combines task-specific cross-entropy ($L_{CE}$) and Kullback-Leibler divergence ($L_{KL}$) between teacher (adapted foundation model) and student predictions:  
   $$
   L = \alpha L_{CE}(y, y_{\text{student}}) + (1 - \alpha) L_{KL}(p_{\text{teacher}} \parallel p_{\text{student}})
   $$  
   where $\alpha$ balances the two objectives. The student model retains performance while reducing inference latency by 3–5×.

**Cloud Interface for Lab-in-the-Loop:**  
A cloud-based platform manages experiment proposals, tracks wet-lab outcomes, and triggers asynchronous model updates. Built on Kubernetes for scalability, the interface integrates with lab equipment APIs to automate data ingestion.

#### 3.2 Experimental Design

**Datasets:**  
- **Protein Engineering:** Use the ProteinGym dataset (protein sequences with fitness scores) and simulated mutagenesis experiments.  
- **Drug Response Prediction:** Leverage single-cell RNA-seq data from Maleki et al. (2024), including responses to 1,000+ compounds.

**Baselines:**  
- **Full Fine-Tuning:** Update all parameters of the foundation model.  
- **Standard PEFT:** Competing methods like LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) and Light-PEFT (Gu et al., 2024).  
- **Random vs. Active Learning:** Compare uncertainty-driven selection with random experiment prioritization.

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
1. **Efficiency:**  
   - GPU hours and memory usage during fine-tuning.  
   - Student model inference latency (ms/sample).  
2. **Effectiveness:**  
   - Prediction accuracy, AUROC, and Spearman correlation (protein fitness).  
3. **Active Learning Performance:**  
   - Number of experiments needed to reach 90% accuracy.  
   - Cost savings compared to exhaustive screening.

**Case Studies:**  
1. Train ActiveLoop on a lab’s in-house drug response data to predict novel compound efficacy.  
2. Optimize enzyme activity using iterative mutagenesis feedback from robotic labs.
