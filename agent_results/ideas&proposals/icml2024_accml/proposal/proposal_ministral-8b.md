### Title: ActiveLoop â€“ Lab-in-the-Loop Active Fine-Tuning for Efficient Biological Foundation Models

---

### Introduction

#### Background

The integration of machine learning (ML) with biological research has the potential to revolutionize the field by enabling rapid and efficient discovery of biological phenomena. However, the gap between ML research and practical application in the lab or clinic is significant. Large foundation models, while powerful, often require extensive computational resources and are not readily adaptable to new data from wet-lab experiments. This hinders their adoption in biological research, where computational resources are typically limited.

#### Research Objectives

This research aims to bridge the gap between ML research and practical biological applications by developing a modular pipeline, ActiveLoop, that enables efficient and accessible fine-tuning of large foundation models. The main objectives are:
1. **Initialization and Fine-Tuning**: To initialize from a pre-trained biological foundation model and attach lightweight low-rank adapters for fast fine-tuning on local GPUs.
2. **Uncertainty-Driven Experiment Selection**: To employ Bayesian active learning to rank candidate experiments by predictive uncertainty, guiding wet-lab assays towards maximal information gain.
3. **Model Compression**: To use knowledge distillation to compress the updated model into a compact student network deployable on modest hardware.
4. **Cloud-Based Management**: To develop a cloud-based interface that manages experiment proposals, records outcomes, and triggers asynchronous adapter updates.

#### Significance

ActiveLoop addresses the key challenges of computational resource constraints, data scarcity, model adaptation efficiency, experimental feedback integration, and uncertainty quantification. By democratizing advanced ML in biology and aligning computational predictions with empirical feedback, ActiveLoop will accelerate hypothesis-driven discovery, making biological research more efficient and accessible.

### Methodology

#### Research Design

ActiveLoop is designed as a modular pipeline that iteratively refines a biological foundation model based on wet-lab experiments. The pipeline consists of three main components: initialization and fine-tuning, uncertainty-driven experiment selection, and model compression.

#### Initialization and Fine-Tuning

1. **Initialization**: Start with a pre-trained biological foundation model, such as a protein language model.
2. **Low-Rank Adapters**: Attach lightweight low-rank adapters to the foundation model for efficient fine-tuning. This approach reduces the number of trainable parameters, making the model adaptable on limited hardware.

   $$
   \mathbf{W}_i = \mathbf{W}_i + \Delta \mathbf{W}_i
   $$
   where $\mathbf{W}_i$ are the original model parameters, and $\Delta \mathbf{W}_i$ are the low-rank updates.

#### Uncertainty-Driven Experiment Selection

1. **Predictive Uncertainty**: Use Bayesian active learning to quantify the predictive uncertainty of the model. This involves estimating the posterior distribution over model predictions and selecting experiments that maximize information gain.

   $$
   P(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}) = \int P(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) P(\mathbf{w} | \mathbf{x}) d\mathbf{w}
   $$
   where $\mathbf{y}$ is the observed data, $\mathbf{x}$ is the input data, $\mathbf{w}$ are the model parameters, and $P(\mathbf{w} | \mathbf{x})$ is the posterior distribution over the model parameters.

2. **Experiment Proposal**: Rank candidate experiments based on their estimated predictive uncertainty and propose the most informative ones for wet-lab assays.

#### Model Compression

1. **Knowledge Distillation**: Use knowledge distillation to compress the updated model into a compact student network. This involves training a smaller model to mimic the behavior of the larger model.

   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{distillation}} = \sum_{\mathbf{x}} D_{\text{KL}}(P_{\text{teacher}}(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}_{\text{teacher}}) || P_{\text{student}}(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}_{\text{student}}))
   $$
   where $D_{\text{KL}}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, $P_{\text{teacher}}$ is the distribution of the teacher model, and $P_{\text{student}}$ is the distribution of the student model.

2. **Deployment**: Deploy the compact student model on modest hardware for real-time predictions.

#### Cloud-Based Management

1. **Experiment Proposal Management**: The cloud-based interface manages experiment proposals, records outcomes, and triggers asynchronous adapter updates.
2. **Data Sharing**: Facilitate real-time data sharing between the lab and the cloud-based platform.
3. **Model Updates**: Continuously update the model based on new experimental data, ensuring that the model remains accurate and relevant.

#### Evaluation Metrics

To validate the method, we will use the following evaluation metrics:
1. **Fine-Tuning Efficiency**: Measure the number of GPU hours required for fine-tuning and the reduction in trainable parameters.
2. **Model Performance**: Evaluate the accuracy and generalization performance of the fine-tuned model on unseen data.
3. **Experiment Selection Efficiency**: Assess the effectiveness of the uncertainty-driven experiment selection in guiding informative assays.
4. **Model Compression**: Measure the size and inference speed of the compressed model compared to the original model.
5. **User Satisfaction**: Conduct user studies to assess the usability and accessibility of the ActiveLoop platform.
