**ActiveLoop: A Lab-in-the-Loop Framework using Bayesian Active Learning and Efficient Fine-Tuning for Accessible Biological Foundation Models**

---

## **2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**

The advent of large-scale Foundation Models (FMs) has revolutionized many fields, including biology. Models pre-trained on vast biological data like protein sequences (e.g., ESM, ProtT5), genomic sequences (e.g., DNABERT, Nucleotide Transformer), or single-cell transcriptomics (e.g., scGPT, scBERT) hold immense potential for accelerating biological discovery, from understanding disease mechanisms to designing novel therapeutics and engineering enzymes [Referencing general FM impact]. However, a significant gap persists between the cutting-edge capabilities demonstrated in machine learning (ML) research and their practical adoption within typical biological laboratories or clinical settings. This "accessibility gap," as highlighted by the workshop theme, stems primarily from the immense computational resources (GPU clusters, large memory) required to train and even fine-tune these FMs [Workshop Call]. Most biological labs operate with modest computational budgets, hindering their ability to leverage these powerful tools. Furthermore, the static nature of pre-trained FMs often conflicts with the dynamic, iterative process of experimental biology, where hypotheses are refined based on wet-lab results. There is a pressing need for methods that make FMs computationally efficient, easily adaptable to specific experimental contexts, and seamlessly integrated into the cyclical workflow of biological research [Workshop Call, Key Challenge 1 & 3].

Recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [9, Thompson et al., 2024] and adapter modules [1, Maleki et al., 2024; 2, Zhan et al., 2024], offer promising avenues for reducing the computational burden of adapting FMs. These methods allow tuning only a small fraction of the model parameters while keeping the large pre-trained backbone frozen, enabling effective specialization on downstream tasks with significantly fewer resources [3, Diao et al., 2023; 4, Gu et al., 2024]. Concurrently, Active Learning (AL) provides a principled framework for efficiently acquiring informative data points, minimizing the number of costly or time-consuming experiments needed to achieve a desired model performance [5, Doe et al., 2023; 6, Brown et al., 2023; 10, Miller et al., 2023]. Bayesian Active Learning (BAL), in particular, leverages uncertainty quantification to guide the selection process, aligning well with the hypothesis-driven nature of scientific inquiry [5, 6]. Integrating these concepts—efficient adaptation and intelligent experiment selection—within a "lab-in-the-loop" system presents a powerful strategy to bridge the accessibility gap. While platforms for integrating ML and wet-lab experiments exist [8, Wilson et al., 2023], a system specifically designed for iterative, uncertainty-guided, and resource-efficient FM adaptation remains an open challenge.

**2.2 Research Objectives**

This research proposes **ActiveLoop**, a modular framework designed to enable efficient and accessible use of biological FMs through iterative, lab-in-the-loop refinement. The primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop the ActiveLoop Framework:** Construct a pipeline integrating:
    *   Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), specifically Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for adapting pre-trained biological FMs on resource-constrained hardware.
    *   Bayesian Active Learning (BAL) methodologies for quantifying model uncertainty and selecting maximally informative candidate experiments (e.g., protein variants, drug candidates) for wet-lab validation.
    *   Knowledge Distillation (KD) techniques [7, Lee et al., 2024] to compress the iteratively refined model (FM + adapter) into a highly efficient "student" model suitable for deployment on standard lab computers or edge devices.
    *   A user-friendly interface (potentially cloud-based) to manage the workflow: presenting predictions and uncertainty estimates, facilitating experiment selection, recording experimental outcomes, and triggering asynchronous model updates.

2.  **Validate ActiveLoop's Efficiency and Effectiveness:** Demonstrate quantitatively that ActiveLoop:
    *   Significantly reduces the computational cost (GPU time, memory) and the number of required experiments compared to standard fine-tuning approaches and non-active learning baselines.
    *   Achieves comparable or superior predictive performance on specific biological tasks (e.g., protein function prediction, drug response prediction) compared to less efficient methods.
    *   Effectively incorporates experimental feedback to iteratively improve model specialization and accuracy.

3.  **Demonstrate Applicability to Biological Discovery:** Showcase ActiveLoop's utility in a realistic biological discovery scenario, highlighting its potential to accelerate hypothesis testing and lead generation within a typical lab setting.

**2.3 Significance**

ActiveLoop directly addresses the central themes of the workshop by proposing a concrete solution to the efficiency and accessibility challenges of applying FMs in biology. Its significance lies in:

*   **Democratizing Foundation Models:** By drastically reducing the computational and experimental resources needed, ActiveLoop empowers smaller labs with limited budgets to harness the power of state-of-the-art FMs.
*   **Accelerating Biological Discovery:** The iterative refinement cycle, guided by intelligent experiment selection, promises to shorten the time from hypothesis generation to experimental validation and model improvement, thereby accelerating the pace of research.
*   **Bridging the ML-Biology Gap:** ActiveLoop provides a practical framework that integrates ML predictions directly into the experimental workflow, fostering closer collaboration between computational and experimental biologists.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Minimizing both computational hours and wet-lab experimentation costs addresses critical resource constraints faced by research labs.
*   **Advancing Lab-in-the-Loop Methodologies:** The integration of PEFT, BAL, and KD within an iterative framework represents a novel methodological contribution applicable to various scientific domains requiring sequential experimentation and model refinement.

## **3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework**

ActiveLoop operates as an iterative cycle, seamlessly integrating computational modeling with experimental feedback. The core steps are:

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a pre-trained biological FM (e.g., ESM-2 for proteins) and initialize a task-specific PEFT module (LoRA adapter). Optionally, use a small initial labeled dataset for preliminary adapter tuning.
2.  **Prediction & Uncertainty Estimation:** Use the current model (FM + adapter) to predict outcomes for a pool of unlabeled candidate experiments (e.g., protein sequences, compounds). Simultaneously, estimate the predictive uncertainty associated with each candidate using BAL techniques.
3.  **Active Selection:** Employ a BAL acquisition function to rank candidates based on their uncertainty (and potentially other criteria like diversity or expected improvement). Select the top-ranked candidates for experimental validation.
4.  **Wet-Lab Experimentation:** Perform the selected experiments in the lab to obtain ground-truth labels for the chosen candidates.
5.  **Model Update (PEFT):** Incorporate the newly acquired labeled data into the training set and efficiently update the PEFT module (LoRA adapter) using the augmented dataset. The FM backbone remains frozen.
6.  **Knowledge Distillation (Optional but Recommended):** Periodically, or upon reaching a performance milestone, distill the knowledge from the large FM combined with the tuned adapter (the "teacher") into a smaller, faster "student" model for efficient deployment or inference.
7.  **Iteration:** Repeat steps 2-6, iteratively refining the model's specialization and predictive accuracy for the target biological task.

This cycle is managed via an interface that facilitates communication between the ML components and the experimental workflow.

**3.2 Algorithmic Details**

**3.2.1 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) Module**

*   **Base Model:** We will select a relevant pre-trained biological FM based on the task, e.g., ESM-2 [Lin et al., 2022] or ProtT5 [Elnaggar et al., 2021] for protein engineering tasks, or a genomic FM [2, Zhan et al., 2024] for genomic annotation tasks. The parameters $\Phi$ of the base FM remain frozen during fine-tuning.
*   **LoRA Adapters:** We will employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [Hu et al., 2021, referenced via 9, Thompson et al., 2024]. For a target weight matrix $W_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$ in the FM, LoRA introduces two low-rank matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$, where the rank $r \ll min(d, k)$. The update is represented as $W = W_0 + \Delta W = W_0 + BA$. Only $A$ and $B$ (containing $r(d+k)$ parameters) are trained, drastically reducing the number of tunable parameters compared to full fine-tuning ($d \times k$).
    $$ W_{updated} = W_{frozen} + B \cdot A $$
    where $W_{frozen}$ represents the weights of the pre-trained FM and $B, A$ are the trainable LoRA matrices. The rank $r$ will be a hyperparameter, typically small (e.g., 4, 8, 16), explored during initial setup.
*   **Training:** Adapter training will use standard optimization techniques (e.g., AdamW) with a suitable loss function for the task (e.g., cross-entropy for classification, mean squared error for regression). This training happens efficiently on a single GPU.

**3.2.2 Bayesian Active Learning (BAL) Module**

*   **Uncertainty Quantification:** To implement BAL, we need to estimate the model's predictive uncertainty. We will primarily explore Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout [Gal & Ghahramani, 2016] as a computationally efficient approximation to Bayesian inference in deep networks. During inference, dropout layers are kept active, and predictions are made multiple times ($T$ stochastic forward passes). The variance or entropy of these predictions serves as an uncertainty estimate.
    Let $f_{\theta}(x)$ be the model (FM + adapter) with parameters $\theta$. With MC Dropout, we approximate the posterior predictive distribution $p(y|x, D_{train})$ by averaging over $T$ samples from the approximate posterior $q(\theta)$:
    $$ p(y|x, D_{train}) \approx \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} p(y|x, \hat{\theta}_t), \quad \hat{\theta}_t \sim q(\theta) $$
    Uncertainty can then be quantified using metrics like predictive entropy $H(y|x, D_{train})$ or variance $Var(y|x, D_{train})$.
*   **Acquisition Function:** We will primarily use uncertainty-based acquisition functions common in BAL:
    *   **Maximum Entropy:** Selects candidates where the model is most uncertain about the prediction: $x^* = \arg\max_x H(y|x, D_{train})$.
    *   **Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD):** Selects candidates that maximize the mutual information between the model parameters and the prediction, seeking points where resolving uncertainty would be most informative about the model itself:
        $$ x^* = \arg\max_x I(y; \theta | x, D_{train}) = H(y | x, D_{train}) - \mathbb{E}_{p(\theta | D_{train})}[H(y | x, \theta)] $$
        The expectation is approximated using the MC samples.
*   **Selection Strategy:** In each iteration, the acquisition function is evaluated over a pool of unlabeled candidates. The top-$k$ candidates (where $k$ is the batch size for experimentation) are selected for wet-lab validation.

**3.2.3 Knowledge Distillation (KD) Module**

*   **Objective:** To create a smaller, faster student model $f_S$ that mimics the behavior of the larger teacher model $f_T$ (FM + fine-tuned adapter).
*   **Student Architecture:** The student model will have a significantly smaller architecture (e.g., a smaller transformer, a BiLSTM, or even a CNN depending on the task and input type) chosen for deployment efficiency.
*   **Distillation Loss:** We will use a standard KD loss function that combines the standard supervised loss on the labeled data with a term that encourages the student's output distribution (soft labels) to match the teacher's output distribution.
    $$ L_{Total} = \alpha L_{Task}(y_S, y_{true}) + (1-\alpha) L_{KD}(p_S^\tau, p_T^\tau) $$
    where $y_S = f_S(x)$ are the student's predictions, $y_{true}$ are the ground-truth labels, $L_{Task}$ is the task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy), $p_S^\tau$ and $p_T^\tau$ are the softened output probabilities from the student and teacher respectively (using temperature scaling $\tau > 1$), $L_{KD}$ is typically the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence $KL(p_T^\tau || p_S^\tau)$, and $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter balancing the two terms. [7, Lee et al., 2024].
*   **Training:** The student model is trained using the accumulated labeled data $(x, y_{true})$ generated throughout the ActiveLoop iterations, optimizing the $L_{Total}$.

**3.2.4 Cloud Integration and Workflow**

*   **Interface:** A simple web-based interface will be developed (or mocked using standard tools like Streamlit or Flask) to manage the workflow [8, Wilson et al., 2023]. It will display candidate experiments ranked by the BAL module, allow users (biologists) to confirm or modify selections, log experimental outcomes, and trigger model updates.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Unlabeled candidates are loaded into the system.
    2.  The backend runs prediction and uncertainty estimation (using the latest model state).
    3.  Ranked candidates are presented on the interface.
    4.  User selects candidates for experiments.
    5.  Experimental results are entered through the interface.
    6.  Backend triggers asynchronous PEFT update using the new data.
    7.  (Optionally) Backend triggers KD training.
*   **Asynchronicity:** Model updates can run in the background, allowing users to continue planning experiments without waiting for computations to finish.

**3.3 Experimental Design for Validation**

**3.3.1 Tasks and Datasets**

We will validate ActiveLoop on at least two representative biological tasks:

1.  **Protein Engineering:** Predicting protein fluorescence intensity or enzyme catalytic activity from sequence. We can use established benchmark datasets like the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) landscape [Sarkisyan et al., 2016] or enzyme activity datasets. The "wet lab" experiment will be simulated by querying the ground truth label from a held-out portion of the dataset for the selected sequences.
    *   *Base FM:* ESM-2 or ProtT5.
    *   *Candidates Pool:* A large set of unlabeled protein sequences (mutants).
    *   *Goal:* Efficiently identify high-performing protein variants with minimal simulated experiments.
2.  **Drug Response Prediction:** Predicting cell line sensitivity to different drugs based on gene expression or mutation profiles, potentially leveraging single-cell FMs and adapters [1, Maleki et al., 2024]. Datasets like GDSC (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer) can be used.
    *   *Base FM:* Relevant transcriptomic or multi-omic FM.
    *   *Candidates Pool:* Unlabeled (cell line, drug) pairs.
    *   *Goal:* Efficiently identify drug-sensitive cell lines or effective compounds with minimal simulated screens.

**3.3.2 Baselines for Comparison**

ActiveLoop will be compared against several baselines to demonstrate the contribution of each component:

1.  **Full Fine-Tuning (Upper Bound/Cost Baseline):** Fine-tuning the entire FM on the full dataset (computationally expensive, serves as a performance reference).
2.  **PEFT + Random Sampling:** Using LoRA adapters but selecting experiments randomly instead of using AL.
3.  **PEFT + Uncertainty Sampling (No KD):** Using LoRA and BAL but without the final knowledge distillation step. This isolates the benefit of AL+PEFT.
4.  **ActiveLoop (Full System):** The proposed framework combining PEFT, BAL, and KD.
5.  **Standard AL (No PEFT):** Attempting active learning with full FM updates (likely computationally infeasible or very slow, highlighting the need for PEFT).

**3.3.3 Evaluation Metrics**

Performance will be evaluated using metrics relevant to both ML efficacy and resource efficiency:

*   **Model Performance:** Task-specific metrics (e.g., Accuracy, AUC-ROC, F1-score for classification; Spearman/Pearson correlation, R², Mean Absolute Error for regression) evaluated on a fixed, held-out test set.
*   **Active Learning Efficiency:**
    *   Performance vs. Number of Labeled Samples/Experiments: Plotting model performance as a function of the number of acquired labels, comparing the learning curves of ActiveLoop against baselines (especially random sampling).
    *   Sample Efficiency: Number of experiments required to reach a target performance threshold (e.g., 90% of the performance achieved by full fine-tuning on the entire dataset).
*   **Computational Efficiency:**
    *   Training Time: Wall-clock time and/or GPU hours required for adapter updates per iteration and total time.
    *   Inference Time: Time required for prediction and uncertainty estimation per candidate.
    *   Parameter Efficiency: Number of trainable parameters (LoRA vs. full model).
    *   Memory Footprint: Peak GPU memory usage during training and inference.
*   **Distillation Effectiveness:**
    *   Student Model Performance: Performance of the distilled student model compared to the teacher (FM+adapter).
    *   Student Model Size & Speed: Model size (MB) and inference speed of the student compared to the teacher.

**3.4 Implementation Details**

We will leverage existing open-source libraries such as Hugging Face Transformers [Wolf et al., 2020] for FMs and PEFT implementations (including LoRA), PyTorch [Paszke et al., 2019] for model building and training, and potentially libraries like modAL [Danka & Horvath, 2018] or custom implementations for the active learning loop. Cloud components might be simulated locally or deployed using platforms like AWS SageMaker or Google AI Platform for scalability testing if resources permit.

*(Self-correction during generation: Initially focused heavily on just AL+PEFT, but the idea description explicitly mentions KD. Integrated KD more formally into the methodology, framework description, experimental design, and expected outcomes. Ensured mathematical notations were correct LaTeX. Checked that all key challenges from the literature review were implicitly or explicitly addressed - e.g., resource constraints by PEFT/KD, data scarcity by AL, adaptation efficiency by PEFT, feedback integration by the loop structure, uncertainty by BAL module.
