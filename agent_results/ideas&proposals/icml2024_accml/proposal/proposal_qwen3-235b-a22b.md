# Research Proposal: ActiveLoop – Lab-in-the-Loop Active Fine-Tuning for Efficient Biological Foundation Models

---

## 1. Introduction

### Background  
The rise of foundation models in biology—such as protein language models (e.g., ProtBERT) and genomic sequence predictors—has unlocked transformative potential for drug discovery, protein engineering, and cellular perturbation predictions. However, their clinical and experimental adoption remains limited due to three core challenges: (1) computational inefficiency (e.g., requiring GPU clusters), (2) inability to adapt iteratively to domain-specific lab data, and (3) lack of alignment between algorithmic predictions and wet-lab feedback. For instance, while frameworks like Lingo (Zhan et al., 2024) demonstrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning via genomic-specific adapters, they lack mechanisms to integrate dynamic experimental results. Similarly, methods like Light-PEFT (Gu et al., 2024) enhance efficiency via pruning but neglect iterative refinement with real-world data. This gap creates a critical need for systems that combine resource-efficient fine-tuning, uncertainty-driven experimentation, and real-time model adaptation.

ActiveLoop directly addresses this challenge by integrating **three innovations**:  
1. **Low-Rank Adapters**: Efficient fine-tuning on local GPUs by modifying a small fraction of model parameters (Maleki et al., 2024; Thompson et al., 2024).  
2. **Bayesian Active Learning**: Prioritizing high-uncertainty experiments to maximize information gain (Doe et al., 2023; Miller et al., 2023).  
3. **Knowledge Distillation**: Compressing updated models into lightweight versions deployable on modest hardware (Lee et al., 2024).  

### Research Objectives  
1. **Efficient Adaptation**: Design and validate a modular pipeline enabling fine-tuning of large foundation models on local GPUs using low-rank adapters.  
2. **Uncertainty-Driven Experimentation**: Develop Bayesian active learning strategies to reduce experimental costs by selecting assays with maximal predictive uncertainty.  
3. **Real-Time Integration**: Deploy a cloud-based interface to synchronize prediction cycles with lab workflows, enabling asynchronous updates and distillation.  

### Significance  
ActiveLoop democratizes access to foundation models by eliminating reliance on cloud-scale GPUs while accelerating discovery. For example, a lab targeting novel protein variants could reduce experimental cycles from 24 months to 6 months by focusing resources on high-impact assays. The framework also advances the workshop’s goals by bridging "lab-in-the-loop" experimentation with efficient ML, directly addressing challenges in parameter efficiency (Hutten et al., 2024), hypothesis-driven learning (Brown et al., 2023), and model accessibility (Wilson et al., 2023).

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Modular Pipeline Architecture  

**System Overview**  
ActiveLoop’s pipeline (Figure 1) consists of three modules:  
1. **Low-Rank Adapters**: Initialize from pre-trained foundation models (e.g., ESM2 (Abedi et al., 2022)) and attach lightweight adapter layers.  
2. **Active Learning Selector**: Rank candidate experiments via Bayesian uncertainty estimates.  
3. **Distilled Student Model**: Compress updated models into deployable networks using knowledge distillation.  

**Low-Rank Adapter Implementation**  
Given a pre-trained transformer layer with weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, we parameterize its update as:  
$$
W' = W + \Delta W, \quad \Delta W = U \cdot V^T
$$  
where $U, V \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ with $r \ll d$ (e.g., $r=64$ for $d=1,024$). This reduces trainable parameters by 99% (Maleki et al., 2024). The adapter is fine-tuned on lab-specific data $\mathcal{D}_{\text{lab}} = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ by minimizing:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{finetune}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \ell(y_i, f_{\text{adapter}}(x_i)),  
$$  
where $\ell$ is a task-appropriate loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification).  

**Knowledge Distillation**  
After adaptation, the updated teacher model $f_{\text{teacher}}$ is distilled into a compact student $f_{\text{student}}$ using KL-divergence loss (Lee et al., 2024):  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}} = \mathbb{E}_{x \in \mathcal{D}_{\text{unlab}}} \left[ \text{KL}\left( \sigma\left( \frac{f_{\text{teacher}}(x)}{\tau} \right) \parallel \sigma\left( \frac{f_{\text{student}}(x)}{\tau} \right) \right) \right],  
$$  
where $\tau$ is a temperature scaling parameter to control the smoothness of the output distribution.

### 2.2 Bayesian Active Learning for Experiment Selection  

**Uncertainty Quantification**  
We model predictive uncertainty using Monte Carlo dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016), where multiple stochastic forward passes estimate variance:  
$$
\sigma^2(x) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T (f_{\theta_t}(x) - \mu(x))^2, \quad \mu(x) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T f_{\theta_t}(x),  
$$  
where $f_{\theta_t}$ denotes the model under dropout sampling.  

**Acquisition Function**  
Candidate experiments $\mathcal{X}_{\text{pool}}$ are scored by a hybrid acquisition function:  
$$
\alpha(x) = \lambda \cdot \text{BALD}(x) + (1-\lambda) \cdot \text{Diversity}(x),  
$$  
where BALD (Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement) captures uncertainty, and diversity maximization ensures coverage of sequence space (Miller et al., 2023). Diversity is computed via $k$-means clustering in latent space.  

**Batch Selection**  
For parallel assays, we implement greedy batch selection:  
1. Rank $\mathcal{X}_{\text{pool}}$ by $\alpha(x)$.  
2. Select top-$b$ candidates while penalizing for pairwise cosine similarity:  
$$
\text{Penalty}(x_i, x_j) = 1 - \frac{x_i^\top x_j}{\|x_i\| \|x_j\|}.  
$$

### 2.3 Cloud-Based Pipeline and Implementation  

**System Workflow**  
1. **Initialization**: Lab submits task description; ActiveLoop selects a pre-trained model (via LMFlow toolkit (Diao et al., 2023)).  
2. **First Cycle**:  
   - Preprocess lab data $\mathcal{D}_{\text{init}}$ (e.g., labeled protein sequences).  
   - Fine-tune adapter and deploy distilled model $\rightarrow$ make predictions on $\mathcal{X}_{\text{pool}}$.  
   - Active selector prioritizes top-K experiments; lab runs them.  
3. **Update**: New data $\mathcal{D}_{\text{new}}$ is uploaded; adapter weights are updated via incremental learning.  

**Cloud Interface**  
- **Frontend**: Web dashboard for experiment proposal, data upload, and result visualization.  
- **Backend**: Flask API connected to a lightweight model container (via FastAPI). Model updates are triggered on a GPU instance (e.g., AWS g4dn.xlarge).

### 2.4 Experimental Evaluation  

**Datasets**:  
- **Protein Engineering**: Deep mutational scans for P450 (Stiffler et al., 2015, N=5,500).  
- **Drug Discovery**: ChEMBL29 (assay IC50 for 1,000 compounds on EGFR).  

**Baselines**:  
- **Random Selection + Full Fine-Tuning**: Naïve baseline.  
- **Lingo + Distillation**: Adapter-based but passive experiment selection (Zhan et al., 2024).  
- **Light-PEFT (Gu et al., 2024)** + Active Learning: Pruned model with uncertainty sampling.  

**Metrics**:  
- **Accuracy**: AUROC, AUPRC, Pearson $r$ for regression.  
- **Efficiency**: GPU hours, inference latency.  
- **Biological Efficacy**: Number of high-confidence hits (e.g., active P450 mutants).  

**Ablation Studies**:  
1. **Adapter vs. Full Fine-Tuning**: Measure compute cost vs. accuracy.  
2. **Distillation Loss**: Compare student-teacher performance.  
3. **Active Learning Efficacy**: Cumulative hits vs. random baselines (Figure 2).

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Technical Contributions  
1. **Reduction in Compute Costs**: Adapter-based fine-tuning (vs. full parameter updates) is projected to reduce GPU hours by 90% (assuming $1\%$ parameters updated).  
2. **Improved Efficiency**: Knowledge distillation will shrink model size by $\times 10$ (e.g., 350M $\rightarrow 35M$ parameters), enabling deployment on Jetson or Raspberry Pi clusters.  
3. **Active Learning Gains**: Bayesian selection is expected to achieve 2$\times$ faster discovery of high-impact assays compared to random sampling (Miller et al., 2023).  

### Biological Impact  
- **Accelerated Discovery**: A lab identifying therapeutic antibodies could reduce iterations from 6 to 2 cycles, saving 18 months.  
- **Democratization**: Enabling low-budget labs to perform foundation model-based research without purchasing cloud GPUs.  

### Broader Implications  
Activeloop aligns with the workshop’s mission by creating a feedback loop where computational predictions and empirical validation co-evolve. By combining parameter efficiency (Hutten et al., 2024), active learning (Brown et al., 2023), and deployment-aware distillation (Lee et al., 2024), it provides a blueprint for accessible, hypothesis-driven ML in biology. The open-source toolkit will foster reproducibility and adaptation to new domains like single-cell transcriptomics or CRISPR screening.
