**Title:** Efficient Lifelong Adaptation of Biological Foundation Models via Lab-in-the-Loop Learning  

**Motivation:** Biological labs generate incremental experimental data but lack resources to retrain large foundation models. Current approaches require cost-prohibitive fine-tuning, hindering real-time model updates for new findings. Bridging this gap demands methods that enable efficient, continuous adaptation of models alongside lab workflows.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a framework integrating parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA) with dynamic model compression to support lifelong model updates. Lab-generated data triggers localized adjustments to compact adapter modules, while quantization-aware training and selective pruning maintain inference efficiency. A tiered cloud interface allows biologists to submit data via user-friendly prompts and receive refined model predictions, prioritizing high-uncertainty samples for experimental validation. Expected outcomes include scalable adaptation of models (e.g., for protein design or gene expression prediction) with <10% of original training costs and compatibility with consumer-grade GPUs. This workflow closes the loop between experimental discovery and model iteration, democratizing access to cutting-edge ML in resource-limited settings.
