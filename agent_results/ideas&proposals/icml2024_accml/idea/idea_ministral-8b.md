### Title: Parameter-Efficient Foundation Models for Biological Discovery

### Motivation:
The growing gap between machine learning (ML) research and its practical application in biological discovery is a significant challenge. Large ML models often require extensive computational resources, which are inaccessible to many biological labs. Additionally, the complexity of these models hinders their usability by non-expert users. This research aims to bridge this gap by developing parameter-efficient foundation models that can be easily adapted and used in biological settings.

### Main Idea:
We propose the development of parameter-efficient foundation models for biological discovery, focusing on model compression and quantization techniques. These models will be designed to use significantly less computational resources while maintaining high accuracy. The methodology will involve:
1. **Model Compression**: Utilizing techniques such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to reduce the number of parameters in the model.
2. **Efficient Training**: Implementing algorithms that allow for efficient training of these compressed models even on modest computational resources.
3. **User-Friendly Interfaces**: Creating accessible cloud/web-based platforms that enable non-expert users to interact with and fine-tune the models based on their specific biological data.

The expected outcomes include:
- **Improved Efficiency**: Models that can be trained and used in resource-constrained environments.
- **Increased Accessibility**: User-friendly interfaces that democratize access to advanced ML techniques.
- **Adaptive Models**: Models that can be iteratively refined based on new experimental data, fostering a "lab in the loop" approach.

The potential impact of this research is significant, as it will enable biologists and clinicians to leverage the power of ML in their discoveries, leading to more efficient and effective biological research and clinical applications.
