### Title: **Data Attribution and Selection for Optimized Model Performance**

### Motivation
The composition of training data significantly influences the performance and behavior of machine learning models. Understanding and attributing model outputs back to specific training examples can help optimize model capabilities and mitigate biases. Efficient data attribution and selection can enhance model performance, reduce training time, and address data leakage issues, especially in large-scale datasets.

### Main Idea
This research focuses on developing methods to attribute model outputs to specific training examples and selecting data to optimize downstream performance. The proposed approach involves:
1. **Attribution Methodology**: Employing techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to attribute model predictions to individual training examples. This will help understand which examples are most influential in shaping model behavior.
2. **Data Selection Framework**: Developing an algorithm that can select a subset of training data to optimize model performance. This involves using active learning and reinforcement learning techniques to iteratively improve the selected data.
3. **Monitoring Data Leakage**: Implementing a system to detect and mitigate data leakage at scale. This includes monitoring feedback loops and ensuring data integrity throughout the training process.
4. **Expected Outcomes**: The research aims to create a framework that can efficiently attribute model outputs to specific training examples, select optimal data subsets, and monitor data integrity. This will lead to more transparent, efficient, and unbiased models.
5. **Potential Impact**: The proposed methods can significantly enhance the performance of machine learning models by optimizing data usage, reducing training times, and mitigating biases. This will have practical implications across various domains, from healthcare to finance, where data quality and model interpretability are critical.
