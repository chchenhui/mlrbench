Title: Concept Mapping for Black-Box Model Interpretability at Scale

1. Introduction  
Background  
Recent advances in large-scale machine learning have dramatically improved model performance across vision, language, and multimodal tasks. However, as models grow in size and complexity, understanding how internal representations give rise to particular behaviors remains an open challenge. In particular, attributing model behaviors—such as classification decisions, biases, or emergent capabilities—to human-understandable factors (“concepts”) is critical for model debugging, fairness audits, and safe deployment. Traditional neuron-level mechanistic interpretability methods excel at identifying individual activation patterns but struggle to connect them to semantic concepts. Conversely, concept-based approaches (e.g., TCAV, ConceptDistil) provide high-level explanations but often rely on expensive human-labeled probe datasets, may not generalize across architectures, and can suffer from dataset dependence or concept leakage. Bridging these two paradigms at scale promises a systematic pathway to attribute model behaviors to latent concepts and to intervene effectively.

Research Objectives  
1. Automatically discover clusters of activation patterns (“latent concepts”) within pre-trained black-box models, without requiring extensive manual concept annotation.  
2. Map these latent concepts to human-interpretable semantic concepts using a small curated concept dataset, aligning machine representations with stakeholder‐relevant notions.  
3. Track how concept representations evolve and combine across layers to influence final predictions, enabling attribution of end‐to‐task behaviors to individual or combined concepts.  
4. Develop targeted intervention mechanisms that modify concept activations mid-inference, thereby allowing controlled mitigation or amplification of specific behaviors (e.g., bias reduction) without full model retraining.  
5. Deliver an open‐source visualization toolkit that presents concept activation paths for arbitrary inputs, facilitating practitioner insight, model audits, and user‐friendly explanations.

Significance  
By unifying activation clustering, concept probing, and intervention, our framework addresses key challenges in model behavior attribution: scalability to large models, minimal reliance on labeled probe data, principled mapping from neurons to concepts, and actionable insights for model improvement. This work stands to advance interpretability in both research and applied settings, improving trust, safety, and fairness in AI systems.

2. Methodology  
Overview  
Our framework comprises four stages: (A) Activation Extraction, (B) Latent Concept Clustering, (C) Concept Attribution & Tracking, and (D) Targeted Intervention & Evaluation. We describe each stage in detail, along with the data, algorithms, and evaluation metrics.

A. Activation Extraction  
Given a pre-trained model \(f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}\) (e.g., a vision or language model), we select a set of \(L\) layers at which to probe activations. For each input example \(x\in\mathcal{X}\), we record the post-activation feature map or vector at layer \(\ell\), denoted \(a^\ell(x)\in\mathbb{R}^{d_\ell}\).  
Data:  
• Unlabeled in‐domain dataset \(\mathcal{D}_\text{probe}\) of size \(N\) (e.g., 100k images/text).  
• Small curated concept dataset \(\mathcal{D}_\text{concept} = \{(x_i, c_i)\}\) where \(c_i\in\{1,\dots,C\}\) indexes human-defined concepts; \(|\mathcal{D}_\text{concept}|\approx 5{,}000\).  

Algorithmic Step A1:  
For each \(\ell=1,\dots,L\) and each \(x\in\mathcal{D}_\text{probe}\), compute \(a^\ell(x)\). Store \(\{a^\ell(x)\}_{x,\ell}\).

B. Latent Concept Clustering  
We aim to discover clusters of activation patterns that recur across inputs, hypothesizing each cluster corresponds to a latent concept or feature.  

B1. Preprocessing  
Normalize activations via layer‐wise whitening:  
$$
\tilde a^\ell(x) = \Sigma_\ell^{-1/2}(a^\ell(x) - \mu_\ell),
$$  
where \(\mu_\ell\) and \(\Sigma_\ell\) are empirical mean and covariance over \(\mathcal{D}_\text{probe}\).  

B2. Clustering  
For each layer \(\ell\), apply \(K\)-means clustering to \(\{\tilde a^\ell(x)\}\), yielding clusters \(\{C_{1}^\ell,\dots,C_{K_\ell}^\ell\}\) with centroids \(\{\mu_{1}^\ell,\dots,\mu_{K_\ell}^\ell\}\). Typical \(K_\ell\) ranges from 50 to 200, selected via silhouette analysis.  

Output: A set of latent clusters \(\{C_k^\ell\}\) across all probed layers.

C. Concept Attribution & Tracking  
We now align latent clusters with human‐interpretable concepts and trace how concept activations flow through the network.

C1. Concept Classifiers  
For each cluster centroid \(\mu_k^\ell\) and each concept \(j\in\{1,\dots,C\}\), train a lightweight linear probe \(g_{j,k}^\ell: \mathbb{R}^{d_\ell}\to[0,1]\) on \(\mathcal{D}_\text{concept}\) to predict concept presence. Loss: binary cross‐entropy. Record the concept‐cluster association score  
$$
s_{j,k}^\ell = \text{AUC}(g_{j,k}^\ell\!\circ\! \tilde a^\ell(x),\,\mathbf{1}_{c(x)=j}).
$$  

Assign cluster \(C_k^\ell\) to the top‐\(M\) concepts with highest \(s_{j,k}^\ell\), thresholded by a minimum AUC (e.g., 0.75).  

C2. Concept Activation Paths  
Given a new input \(x\), compute for each layer \(\ell\) and cluster \(k\) the assignment probability  
$$
p_{k}^\ell(x) = \frac{\exp(-\|\tilde a^\ell(x)-\mu_{k}^\ell\|^2)}{\sum_{k'}\exp(-\|\tilde a^\ell(x)-\mu_{k'}^\ell\|^2)}.
$$  
For each concept \(j\), define its activation at layer \(\ell\) as  
$$
\alpha_j^\ell(x) = \sum_{k\,:\,j\in\mathrm{TopM}(k,\ell)} p_{k}^\ell(x)\,s_{j,k}^\ell.
$$  
The sequence \(\{\alpha_j^1(x),\dots,\alpha_j^L(x)\}\) forms the concept activation path. We visualize these paths to show how each concept’s influence grows, shrinks, or merges across layers.

D. Targeted Intervention & Experimental Validation  
To test attribution and enable bias mitigation, we introduce interventions that perturb concept activations.  

D1. Concept Intervention Operator  
For a target concept \(j\) at layer \(\ell\), define a gating operator  
$$
T_{j,\ell}^\gamma(a^\ell)=a^\ell + \gamma\,( \mu_{k^*}^\ell - a^\ell),
$$  
where \(k^*=\arg\max_k\{\mathbf{1}_{j\in\mathrm{TopM}(k,\ell)}\,p_k^\ell(x)\}\) is the cluster most associated with \(j\), and \(\gamma\in[-1,1]\) controls the interpolation (negative to suppress, positive to amplify). We apply \(T_{j,\ell}^\gamma\) during a forward pass and record the change in output:  
$$
\Delta f(x) = f(x)\bigl|_{\text{with }T_{j,\ell}^\gamma} - f(x)\bigl|_{\text{orig}}.
$$  

D2. Experimental Design  
We evaluate on two domains:  
• Vision: Pre-trained ResNet50 on ImageNet, concept dataset drawn from Broden with 75 visual concepts (e.g., textures, shapes).  
• Language: Pre-trained T5 on sentiment analysis (IMDb), concept dataset labeled for sentiment cues (e.g., “negation”, “positive adjective”).  

For each domain, we perform:  
1. Attribution Fidelity: Compare concept activation paths against TCAV scores and neuron-saliency baselines. Metrics: rank correlation (Spearman ρ) between our \(\{\alpha_j^L\}\) and TCAV concept importance.  
2. Intervention Effectiveness: For concepts known to be biases (e.g., gendered roles), measure reduction in biased predictions when applying \(\gamma=-0.5\) at the top two layers. Metric: bias score reduction (∆ in demographic parity).  
3. Generalization & Scalability: Vary \(K_\ell\) and \(|\mathcal{D}_\text{concept}|\) to assess stability of concept‐cluster mappings (measured by cluster‐concept assignment stability across runs).  

Implementation Details  
• Optimization for clustering: use mini-batch K-means with 250‐sample batches.  
• Probe training: single‐layer linear classifiers, early stopping on validation AUC.  
• Visualization: interactive web interface showing layer‐by‐layer bar charts of \(\alpha_j^\ell(x)\), with links to representative input patches or tokens.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate the following primary outcomes:  
• A scalable, semi-automatic pipeline for discovering and mapping latent concepts in large models, reducing reliance on extensive manual annotation.  
• Quantitative evidence that concept activation paths correspond closely to existing concept importance measures (e.g., TCAV), with improved localization of concept emergence in layers.  
• Demonstrations of targeted concept interventions that meaningfully alter model outputs—e.g., mitigating identified biases—without full model retraining.  
• An open-source toolkit (code, documentation, and visualization interface) enabling researchers and practitioners to apply concept mapping to their own models and datasets.  

Impact  
Our proposed framework directly advances the goals of model behavior attribution by providing:  
1. Data Attribution: It illustrates how specific semantic concepts (rooted in training data) propagate through network layers to produce behaviors.  
2. Mechanistic Bridging: By clustering activations at multiple depths, we open a path toward mechanistic interpretability that operates at the concept level, facilitating more intuitive insights than neuron‐level approaches alone.  
3. Algorithmic Insights: Tracking concept flows uncovers which architectural choices or optimization details (e.g., layer normalization, depth) influence concept emergence, guiding future architecture design.  
4. Safety & Fairness: The intervention mechanism serves as a blueprint for bias mitigation strategies that act on intermediate activations, offering a lightweight alternative to dataset re-training or post-hoc filtering.  

In sum, Concept Mapping for Black-Box Model Interpretability at Scale promises to deepen our understanding of how models internalize and combine human-understandable concepts, thereby fostering more accountable, transparent, and controllable AI systems.
