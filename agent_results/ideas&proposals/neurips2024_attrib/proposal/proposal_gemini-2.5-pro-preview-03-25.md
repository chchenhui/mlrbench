# **Research Proposal: Tracing Concept Evolution Through Deep Neural Networks for Enhanced Model Behavior Attribution**

## 1. Title

**Tracing Concept Evolution: A Framework for Attributing Deep Learning Model Behavior via Unsupervised Concept Mapping and Flow Analysis**

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Background

The remarkable capabilities of modern machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs) like large language models (LLMs) and complex vision transformers, stem from intricate interactions between vast datasets, sophisticated architectures, and advanced training algorithms. However, this complexity renders them largely "black boxes," hindering our ability to understand *why* they behave the way they do. As highlighted by the workshop theme "Attributing Model Behavior at Scale," a critical challenge remains: connecting observable model behaviors (predictions, errors, biases) back to their underlying causes, whether in the training data, the model's internal components, or the learning process itself. Without robust attribution methods, ensuring model reliability, fairness, safety, and facilitating systematic improvement becomes exceedingly difficult.

Current interpretability research offers valuable tools but often falls short in providing a comprehensive understanding. Mechanistic interpretability (Olah et al., 2017; Elhage et al., 2021) delves into neuron-level operations but struggles to scale or link findings to high-level, human-understandable functions. Conversely, concept-based interpretability methods (Kim et al., 2018; Ghorbani et al., 2019) aim to explain model decisions in terms of human-defined concepts. Recent advances like ConLUX (Liu et al., 2024) and ConceptDistil (Sousa et al., 2022) provide concept-based explanations for black-box models. However, as Ramaswamy et al. (2022) point out, these methods face significant challenges: dependence on potentially biased or poorly learnable predefined concept datasets, limitations in human cognitive capacity to process numerous concepts, and difficulties in ensuring true alignment between machine representations and human semantics (Marconato et al., 2023). Furthermore, most existing methods offer static snapshots or local explanations, failing to capture how concepts are represented, transformed, and combined dynamically *through* the layers of a deep network to produce the final output.

### 2.2 Research Idea and Gap

This research proposes a novel framework, **ConceptFlow Mapper**, designed to bridge the gap between low-level mechanisms and high-level conceptual understanding. Our core idea is to automatically identify latent conceptual representations within trained models and map their evolution across network layers. We aim to achieve this by:

1.  Employing unsupervised clustering on neuron activations within different layers to discover emergent, data-driven 'latent concepts' without relying solely on predefined concept libraries.
2.  Developing techniques to automatically associate these latent concepts with human-interpretable labels, potentially leveraging multimodal models or external knowledge bases.
3.  Explicitly modeling and tracking the *transformation* and *interaction* of these concepts as information flows through the network hierarchy.
4.  Visualizing these 'concept flow' pathways to provide intuitive explanations for specific model predictions or behaviors.

This approach directly addresses several key challenges identified in the literature. By using unsupervised discovery, we reduce dependence on potentially problematic predefined probe datasets (Ramaswamy et al., 2022). By tracking transformations, we move beyond static concept attribution and gain insight into the *process* by which concepts contribute to decisions, offering a richer understanding of internal mechanisms and improving alignment (Marconato et al., 2023). By visualizing concept pathways, we aim to present complex information in a potentially more digestible format, mitigating cognitive overload.

### 2.3 Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop an Unsupervised Latent Concept Discovery Module:** To identify stable and meaningful clusters of activation patterns within different layers of pre-trained DNNs, representing latent concepts learned by the model.
2.  **Develop an Automated Concept Labeling Module:** To map the discovered latent concepts to human-interpretable names or descriptions using techniques like multimodal embedding alignment (e.g., CLIP) or ontology mapping, minimizing reliance on manual annotation or fixed concept datasets.
3.  **Develop a Concept Flow Analysis Module:** To model and quantify how these concepts transform and interact across successive layers of the network, potentially represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
4.  **Implement an Interactive Visualization Tool:** To display the discovered concepts, their assigned labels, and their activation pathways for given inputs, allowing users to explore how concept combinations lead to specific outputs.
5.  **Validate the Framework:** To empirically demonstrate the framework's ability to attribute model behavior (e.g., correct predictions, errors, biased outputs) to specific concept pathways on benchmark datasets and models, comparing its effectiveness against existing interpretability methods.

### 2.4 Significance

This research holds significant potential for advancing the field of machine learning interpretability and attribution. By providing a principled way to map and track concepts through deep networks, ConceptFlow Mapper can offer:

*   **Enhanced Transparency:** Deeper insights into the internal reasoning processes of complex models beyond input-output correlations.
*   **Improved Debugging and Diagnosis:** Pinpointing specific conceptual processing failures or problematic concept associations responsible for errors or biases (e.g., identifying reliance on spurious correlations represented as concepts).
*   **Principled Model Comparison:** Analyzing how different architectures or training regimes lead to different internal concept representations and processing pathways.
*   **Contribution to Responsible AI A:** Facilitating audits for fairness and safety by revealing how sensitive attributes might be encoded and processed conceptually within the model.
*   **Bridging Interpretability Paradigms:** Connecting neuron-level activity (via activations) to high-level conceptual reasoning, offering a more holistic understanding.

Successfully achieving these objectives will provide researchers and practitioners with a powerful new tool for understanding and attributing the behavior of complex AI systems, directly contributing to the goals outlined by the "Attributing Model Behavior at Scale" workshop.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Research Design Overview

Our research will follow a constructive methodology, involving the design, implementation, and empirical validation of the ConceptFlow Mapper framework. The framework consists of several interconnected modules:

1.  **Activation Data Collection:** Extracting activation vectors from target layers of pre-trained models for a representative dataset.
2.  **Layer-wise Latent Concept Discovery:** Applying unsupervised clustering to activations within each target layer.
3.  **Concept Labeling and Mapping:** Associating cluster centroids with human-interpretable labels.
4.  **Concept Flow Graph Construction:** Modeling transitions between concepts across layers.
5.  **Attribution and Visualization:** Using the graph to trace concept paths for specific inputs and generate explanations.
6.  **Experimental Validation:** Evaluating the framework's performance and utility.

We will primarily focus on image classification and potentially natural language processing tasks, using widely studied model architectures and benchmark datasets.

### 3.2 Data Collection and Preparation

*   **Models:** We will select representative pre-trained models from different families, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (e.g., ResNet-50, InceptionV3) and Vision Transformers (e.g., ViT-Base) for image tasks, and potentially Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-Base, GPT-2) for language tasks. Models will be sourced from standard repositories like PyTorch Hub or Hugging Face.
*   **Input Datasets:** For activation extraction, we will use diverse subsets of standard benchmark datasets relevant to the pre-trained models (e.g., ImageNet validation set for vision models, GLUE benchmark subsets for NLP models). We will ensure the subsets cover a wide range of classes and potential concepts. Let $X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_N\}$ be the input dataset.
*   **Activation Extraction:** For each input $x_i \in X$, we will perform a forward pass through the model and collect activation vectors from selected intermediate layers $L = \{l_1, l_2, ..., l_M\}$. We focus on layers known to capture increasingly abstract features (e.g., intermediate convolutional blocks, transformer layers). The activation vector for input $x_i$ at layer $l$ is denoted $A_{l,i} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_l}$, where $d_l$ is the dimensionality of the activation space at layer $l$. If $d_l$ is excessively large, dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, Autoencoders trained on activations) may be applied, $A'_{l,i} = \text{ReduceDim}(A_{l,i})$.

### 3.3 Algorithmic Steps

**Step 1: Layer-wise Latent Concept Discovery**

For each target layer $l \in L$, we apply unsupervised clustering to the set of activation vectors $\{A'_{l,i}\}_{i=1}^N$.

*   **Clustering Algorithm:** We will explore algorithms like K-Means (for efficiency), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) (for probabilistic assignments), or density-based methods like DBSCAN/HDBSCAN (to avoid specifying the number of clusters). The choice may depend on the activation distribution characteristics.
*   **Distance Metric:** Cosine similarity is often suitable for high-dimensional vectors like activations, measuring orientation rather than magnitude. Euclidean distance will also be considered.
*   **Output:** For each layer $l$, this step yields a set of $k_l$ clusters. Each cluster $j$ is represented by its centroid $c_{l,j}$ (e.g., mean activation vector for K-Means/GMM) or a set of core points (for DBSCAN). These centroids represent the identified 'latent concepts' at layer $l$. $C_l = \{c_{l,1}, c_{l,2}, ..., c_{l,k_l}\}$.

**Step 2: Automated Concept Labeling**

We aim to associate each latent concept centroid $c_{l,j}$ with a human-interpretable label $T_{l,j}$.

*   **Multimodal Alignment (for Vision):** We will leverage pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021).
    1.  Identify representative image patches corresponding to activations belonging to cluster $j$ at layer $l$. This can be done by finding inputs $x_i$ whose activations $A'_{l,i}$ are closest to the centroid $c_{l,j}$ and mapping the activation location back to the input image space (potentially using attention maps or receptive fields).
    2.  Encode these image patches using CLIP's image encoder: $E_{img} = \text{CLIP_ImageEncoder}(\text{Patch}(x_i))$.
    3.  Compare $E_{img}$ against text embeddings of candidate concept names from a predefined vocabulary (e.g., WordNet synsets, existing concept dataset labels like Broden) using cosine similarity: $S(E_{img}, E_{text}) = \frac{E_{img} \cdot E_{text}}{\|E_{img}\| \|E_{text}\|}$.
    4.  Assign the label $T_{l,j}$ corresponding to the highest average similarity across representative patches.
    $$ T_{l,j} = \arg \max_{T \in \text{Vocabulary}} \mathbb{E}_{i \sim \text{Cluster}(j)} \left[ S(\text{CLIP_ImageEncoder}(\text{Patch}(x_i)), \text{CLIP_TextEncoder}(T)) \right] $$
*   **Ontology / Knowledge Base Mapping (General):** For concepts that might not be easily visualizable or for NLP tasks, we can explore mapping activation cluster centroids (potentially after further embedding) to concepts in structured knowledge bases like WordNet or domain-specific ontologies using embedding similarity.
*   **Label Quality Assessment:** We will use metrics like label coherence (e.g., pointwise mutual information between generated labels for related clusters) and potentially human evaluation on a subset of concepts to assess label quality.

**Step 3: Concept Flow Graph Construction**

We model the transformation of concepts between adjacent layers $l$ and $l+1$.

*   **Input-Specific Tracing:** For each input $x_i$, determine the closest concept centroid (cluster) for its activation at each layer: $k_{l,i}^* = \arg \min_j \text{distance}(A'_{l,i}, c_{l,j})$. This gives a sequence of active concepts $(k_{l_1,i}^*, k_{l_2,i}^*, ..., k_{l_M,i}^*)$ for input $x_i$.
*   **Transition Probability Estimation:** Aggregate these sequences over the dataset $X$ to estimate the probability of transitioning from concept $j$ at layer $l$ to concept $k$ at layer $l+1$:
    $$ P(c_{l+1,k} | c_{l,j}) \approx \frac{ |\{ i \mid k_{l,i}^* = j \land k_{l+1,i}^* = k \}| }{ |\{ i \mid k_{l,i}^* = j \}| } $$
    These probabilities represent the weights of edges in a directed graph where nodes are $(l, j)$ (concept $j$ at layer $l$).
*   **Graph Refinement:** Consider incorporating activation magnitudes or attention weights (if applicable) to refine edge weights, representing not just transition likelihood but also signal strength. Prune low-probability transitions.

**Step 4: Attribution and Visualization**

*   **Concept Activation Path:** For a new input $x_{new}$, compute its activation sequence $(k_{l_1,new}^*, ..., k_{l_M,new}^*)$. This path, visualized on the Concept Flow Graph using the assigned labels $T_{l,j}$, provides an explanation based on the sequence of concepts activated.
*   **Concept Influence Score:** Define a score $\text{Inf}(c_{l,j} \to y)$ quantifying the influence of concept $j$ at layer $l$ on the final prediction $y$. This could be based on:
    *   Path analysis on the graph (e.g., aggregating transition probabilities along paths leading to the prediction).
    *   Perturbation methods: Estimate the change in prediction $y$ when activations corresponding to concept $c_{l,j}$ are perturbed or ablated.
    *   Gradient-based methods: Adapt techniques like Integrated Gradients to the concept space, measuring the integral of gradients with respect to the activation strength of concept $c_{l,j}$.
*   **Visualization Tool:** Develop an interactive interface (e.g., using D3.js or Plotly) that displays:
    *   The layered Concept Flow Graph with labeled nodes.
    *   Highlighted activation paths for user-selected inputs.
    *   Concept influence scores for the final prediction.
    *   Representative input examples (or patches) associated with specific concept nodes.

### 3.4 Experimental Design and Validation

We will conduct rigorous experiments to validate the ConceptFlow Mapper framework.

*   **Baselines:** We will compare our framework against relevant state-of-the-art interpretability methods:
    *   **Concept-based:** TCAV (Testing with Concept Activation Vectors) (Kim et al., 2018), ConceptShap (Yeh et al., 2020), potentially ConLUX (Liu et al., 2024) and ConceptDistil (Sousa et al., 2022) if implementations are available or reproducible.
    *   **Mechanistic/Feature Attribution:** Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2017), Network Dissection (Bau et al., 2017).
*   **Tasks & Datasets:** Primarily image classification (ImageNet) and potentially fine-grained classification (e.g., CUB-200-2011) or NLP tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis on SST-2).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Faithfulness:**
        *   *Prediction Correlation:* Correlation between the presence/activation score of high-influence concepts and the model's prediction score/class probability.
        *   *Perturbation Analysis:* Measure the drop in prediction accuracy when high-influence concepts (identified by our method vs. baselines) are "removed" (e.g., by setting corresponding activations to zero or their mean).
    *   **Interpretability & Coherence:**
        *   *Label Quality:* Use automated metrics (e.g., NPMI for text labels) and conduct small-scale user studies asking participants to rate the meaningfulness and consistency of the automatically generated concept labels and flow explanations.
        *   *User Studies:* Evaluate the utility of the visualization tool. Task participants (e.g., ML students/researchers) with diagnosing model errors or identifying biases using our tool versus baseline methods, measuring task completion time and accuracy.
    *   **Robustness:** Assess the stability of discovered concepts and flow graphs under minor perturbations of input data or model parameters (e.g., different initialization seeds if retraining small models, or comparing across similar architectures).
    *   **Scalability:** Measure the computational time and memory requirements for each module (clustering, labeling, graph construction) as a function of model size (number of layers, layer width) and dataset size $N$.
    *   **Case Studies:** Provide qualitative examples demonstrating how ConceptFlow Mapper can attribute specific behaviors:
        *   Explaining correct classifications based on intuitive concept paths.
        *   Diagnosing misclassifications by identifying erroneous concept activations or transitions.
        *   Uncovering reliance on spurious correlations (e.g., a 'water' concept strongly influencing 'boat' predictions, even when inappropriate).
        *   Identifying potential biases by tracing how concepts related to sensitive attributes influence outcomes.
