Title  
Self-Calibrating Differentiable Scientific Layers for Hybrid Machine Learning  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Modern scientific modeling and machine-learning (ML) offer complementary strengths. Scientific models (e.g., systems of differential equations, first-principles simulators) encode domain knowledge and physical constraints, but they are often rigid, rely on idealized assumptions, and may not capture high-fidelity real-world complexity. Pure ML models excel at fitting data and capturing complex patterns, but require large labeled datasets, can violate known physical laws, and offer limited interpretability. Hybrid or grey-box modeling seeks to combine the two paradigms, trading off bias and variance to obtain models that are both physically grounded and data-adaptive.  

Recent work on differentiable hybrid models has shown promise:  
 • Differentiable FSI modeling (Fan & Wang, 2023) integrates numerical fluid-structure solvers with recurrent neural nets in an end-to-end differentiable pipeline.  
 • Multi-fidelity fusion (Deng et al., 2023) uses neural architecture search to blend low- and high-fidelity physics simulations.  
 • DiffHybrid-UQ (Akhare et al., 2024) adds uncertainty quantification to hybrid differentiable models via deep ensembles.  
 • Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) (Raissi et al., 2019) impose PDE constraints in loss functions.  
These approaches have advanced accuracy and data efficiency but face key challenges: interpretability and trustworthiness of learned hybrid parameters; data efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization; uncertainty quantification (UQ); computational complexity; and seamless integration of domain knowledge without bias.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a general framework for embedding scientific models as adaptive, differentiable layers in neural networks. Our objectives are:  
1. Design differentiable layers that implement scientific simulators (e.g., ODE/PDE solvers, multi-body dynamics) whose key parameters (coefficients, boundary conditions) are trainable alongside neural network weights.  
2. Develop joint end-to-end training algorithms using automatic differentiation (autodiff) and, where necessary, adjoint methods to propagate gradients through scientific layers.  
3. Integrate Bayesian or ensemble-based UQ to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in hybrid predictions.  
4. Validate the framework on representative applications in climate modeling, fluid-structure interaction, and physiological systems, comparing against pure scientific, pure ML, and existing hybrid baselines.  

Significance  
A self-calibrating differentiable scientific layer framework will:  
 • Improve generalization in regimes where purely data-driven models fail or where simulation accuracy degrades (e.g., extrapolation of climate forecasts).  
 • Enhance interpretability by recovering physically meaningful parameters (e.g., diffusion coefficients, reaction rates) from data.  
 • Reduce data requirements by leveraging physical constraints, broadening applicability in domains with limited observational data (e.g., rare floods, patient-specific physiology).  
 • Provide calibrated uncertainty estimates critical for decision making in high-stakes domains (e.g., medical dosing, engineering design).  

2. Methodology  
2.1 Overview of Hybrid Architecture  
We propose two prototype architectures for hybrid modeling:  
 A. Serial Composition  
 Input $x$ → Scientific layer $g(x;\theta_s)$ → Neural network $f_{\rm NN}(\cdot;\theta_n)$ → Output $\hat y$.  
 B. Parallel Composition  
 Input $x$ → both $g(x;\theta_s)$ and $f_{\rm NN}(x;\theta_n)$ → Fusion module $h(\,[g, f_{\rm NN}];\theta_h)$ → Output $\hat y$.  

Here $\theta_s$ are scientific-model parameters (e.g., diffusion coefficients, boundary conditions), $\theta_n$ are neural network weights, and $\theta_h$ are fusion weights in the parallel model.  

2.2 Differentiable Scientific Layer  
We implement $g(x;\theta_s)$ as a differentiable solver for systems of ODEs/PDEs. For example, a reaction–diffusion PDE  
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D(\theta_s)\nabla^2 u + R(u;\theta_s),
$$  
discretized in space and time with method of lines. The solver is unrolled for $T$ steps:  
$$
u_{t+1} = u_t + \Delta t\bigl(D(\theta_s)\,L\,u_t + R(u_t;\theta_s)\bigr)\,,
$$  
where $L$ is the spatial Laplacian matrix. All operations are implemented in an autodiff-friendly framework (e.g., JAX, PyTorch). Gradients $\partial \hat y/\partial \theta_s$ are obtained via backprop through the unrolled steps or via adjoint methods when $T$ is large.  

2.3 Neural Network Component  
For the ML component we use a residual convolutional network (for spatiotemporal data) or a feedforward network (for vector inputs). Denote it by  
$$
f_{\rm NN}(z;\theta_n) = \mathrm{NN}(z)\,,
$$  
with nonlinearities (ReLU, Swish), batch normalization, and dropout (for aleatoric UQ).  

2.4 Joint Training Objective  
Given a dataset $\{(x^{(i)},y^{(i)})\}_{i=1}^N$, we optimize  
$$
\min_{\theta_s,\theta_n,\theta_h} 
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \mathcal{L}\bigl(\hat y^{(i)},y^{(i)}\bigr)
+ \lambda_s \,R_s(\theta_s) + \lambda_n \,R_n(\theta_n)\,,
$$  
where $\hat y^{(i)}$ is the model output (from serial or parallel composition), $\mathcal{L}$ is an application-specific loss (e.g., mean squared error: $\| \hat y - y\|^2$), and $R_s,R_n$ are regularizers (e.g., $L_2$ norms). Hyperparameters $\lambda_s,\lambda_n$ control regularization strength.  

2.5 Uncertainty Quantification  
We adopt an ensemble approach for epistemic UQ: train $M$ models with random initialization and/or data bootstrapping. For aleatoric UQ we augment $\mathcal{L}$ with a heteroscedastic noise model: if $y\sim\mathcal{N}(\hat y,\sigma^2(x;\theta_\sigma))$, the negative log-likelihood loss is  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\rm NLL} = 
\frac{1}{N}\sum_i\bigl[\tfrac{1}{2}\log\sigma^2(x^{(i)}) + 
\frac{\|y^{(i)}-\hat y^{(i)}\|^2}{2\sigma^2(x^{(i)})}\bigr]\,,
$$  
with $\sigma(x;\theta_\sigma)$ predicted by a small neural head.  

2.6 Data Collection and Generation  
We will evaluate on three domains:  
1. Climate Modeling  
 – Dataset: historical reanalysis (ERA-5) for temperature fields; high-resolution simulations from a general circulation model (GCM).  
2. Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI)  
 – Dataset: simulation snapshots from canonical FSI benchmarks (cylinder in cross-flow, flexible beam) at multiple Reynolds numbers.  
3. Physiological Modeling  
 – Dataset: pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic (PK–PD) models with real patient dosing/outcome records.  

For each domain, we generate low-fidelity data (coarse resolution simulation or simplified ODE models) and high-fidelity ground truth (fine mesh simulation or clinical data). We partition into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets ensuring diversity in operating conditions.  

2.7 Experimental Design  
Baselines:  
 • Pure scientific calibration: optimize $\theta_s$ only, no ML component.  
 • Pure ML: neural network mapping $x\mapsto y$.  
 • PINNs: integrate physics in loss only.  
 • Multi-fidelity fusion (Deng et al., 2023).  

Ablations:  
 • Freeze $\theta_s$ vs trainable $\theta_s$.  
 • Serial vs parallel composition.  
 • With vs without UQ module.  

We evaluate:  
 • Accuracy: RMSE, MAE, $R^2$.  
 • Generalization: performance on out-of-distribution test sets (e.g., unseen Reynolds numbers, future years in climate).  
 • Interpretability: compare learned $\theta_s$ against known physical values; relative error $\|\hat\theta_s-\theta_s^\ast\|/\|\theta_s^\ast\|$.  
 • UQ Calibration: continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), prediction interval coverage probability (PICP).  
 • Computational cost: training time, inference latency, memory usage.  

2.8 Algorithmic Steps  
Algorithm 1: End-to-End Hybrid Training  
1. Initialize scientific parameters $\theta_s$, neural weights $\theta_n,\theta_h,\theta_\sigma$.  
2. For epoch = 1 to $E$:  
3.   Shuffle training data.  
4.   For each minibatch $\{x_b,y_b\}$:  
5.     Compute scientific layer output $z_b = g(x_b;\theta_s)$ (or both $z^s_b$, $z^n_b = f_{\rm NN}(x_b;\theta_n)$ for parallel).  
6.     Fuse: $\hat y_b = h([z_b,z^n_b];\theta_h)$ or $\hat y_b = f_{\rm NN}(z_b;\theta_n)$.  
7.     If UQ: predict $\sigma_b = \sigma(x_b;\theta_\sigma)$.  
8.     Compute loss $\mathcal{L}(\hat y_b,y_b)$ (or NLL if UQ) + regularization.  
9.     Backpropagate gradients $\nabla_{\theta_s,\theta_n,\theta_h,\theta_\sigma}\mathcal{L}$ via autodiff/adjoint.  
10.    Update parameters with Adam optimizer.  
11. Evaluate on validation set; early-stop if no improvement for $K$ epochs.  

2.9 Implementation Details  
 • We will implement in JAX or PyTorch to leverage vectorized autodiff.  
 • Scientific layers will exploit sparsity in differential operators and GPU acceleration.  
 • Hyperparameter search via Bayesian optimization (Optuna) for learning rates, regularization strengths, ensemble size.  
 • Code and data to be released under open-source license.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Expected Outcomes  
 • A general software library for differentiable scientific layers compatible with major DL frameworks.  
 • Demonstrated accuracy improvements (10–30% RMSE reduction) over pure-scientific and pure-ML baselines in all three domains.  
 • Quantitative evidence of out-of-distribution generalization gains (at least 15% lower error).  
 • Recovery of physically interpretable parameters within 5% of ground truth.  
 • Well-calibrated uncertainty estimates (CRPS improvements of 20%).  

Impact  
 • Enable hybrid models that “self-calibrate” scientific simulators from limited data, reducing reliance on manual parameter tuning.  
 • Bridge the gap between domain experts and ML practitioners by providing transparent, interpretable model components.  
 • Accelerate applications in climate forecasting, healthcare dosing, and engineering design by offering reliable predictive tools with quantifiable uncertainty.  
 • Offer a template for further hybrid modeling research—extensible to other physical domains (e.g., neuroscience, materials science).  
 • Foster community adoption through open-source release, detailed tutorials, and benchmark datasets.  

In summary, this proposal lays out a concrete, mathematically grounded plan to embed and adapt scientific models as differentiable layers within neural architectures. By jointly learning physical parameters and neural functions end-to-end, quantifying uncertainty, and rigorously evaluating on key scientific applications, we aim to chart a robust path toward trustworthy, data-efficient hybrid modeling.
