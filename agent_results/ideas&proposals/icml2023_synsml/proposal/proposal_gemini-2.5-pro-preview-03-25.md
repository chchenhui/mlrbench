## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **Adaptive Differentiable Scientific Layers for Physically-Consistent and Data-Efficient Hybrid Neural Modeling**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
The scientific community is increasingly facing complex modeling challenges where purely data-driven or purely theory-driven approaches show limitations. Machine learning (ML) models, particularly deep neural networks, excel at learning intricate patterns from large datasets but often lack interpretability, struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, and require substantial labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive in scientific domains [5]. Conversely, traditional scientific models, derived from first principles (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology), offer interpretability and incorporate domain knowledge, ensuring physical consistency. However, they often rely on simplifying assumptions, empirical closures, or poorly calibrated parameters, limiting their accuracy and applicability to complex, real-world phenomena [4].

The Synergy of Scientific and Machine Learning Modeling (SynS & ML) workshop highlights the critical need to bridge this gap by combining the strengths of both paradigms. This emerging field, often termed hybrid modeling or grey-box modeling, aims to create models that are both data-aware and physically-informed. Early successes include Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], which incorporate physical laws (typically partial differential equations, PDEs) as soft constraints within the ML model's loss function. While powerful, PINNs primarily use physics to regularize the ML solution, often treating the underlying physical model structure as fixed.

Recent advances in differentiable programming [1, 4] and automatic differentiation libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX) have opened new avenues. It is now feasible to differentiate through complex computational pipelines, including iterative solvers or simulations derived from scientific principles. This enables the direct embedding of scientific models as components (layers) within larger ML architectures, allowing for end-to-end training via gradient descent. Several works have explored differentiable hybrid models, integrating numerical representations of physics with neural networks for specific applications like fluid-structure interaction [1] or leveraging multi-fidelity data [2]. Differentiable modeling is also gaining traction in specific domains like geosciences [4].

**2.2 Problem Statement**
Despite progress, significant challenges remain in hybrid modeling [Lit Review Challenges]:
*   **Rigidity of Embedded Knowledge:** Existing hybrid approaches often embed scientific knowledge in a fixed manner (e.g., fixed PDE forms in PINNs, fixed simulation structures). Real-world systems often exhibit behaviors that deviate slightly from idealized models, or key physical parameters might be uncertain or vary under different conditions. There is a need for hybrid models where the embedded scientific component itself can adapt based on data.
*   **Interpretability and Trustworthiness:** While hybrid models promise improved interpretability, the interaction between the black-box ML components and the scientific model can still be opaque. Making the *parameters* of the scientific model learnable offers a potential avenue for enhanced interpretability, grounding model adaptations in physically meaningful terms [Lit Review Challenge 1].
*   **Data Efficiency and Generalization:** Leveraging domain knowledge should ideally reduce the reliance on large datasets and improve generalization beyond the training distribution. However, effectively achieving this synergy requires architectures that seamlessly integrate and co-adapt both knowledge and data [Lit Review Challenge 2].
*   **Seamless Integration:** Developing flexible frameworks that allow domain scientists to easily integrate their existing (potentially complex) scientific models into ML pipelines and make them differentiable and adaptable remains a practical hurdle [Lit Review Challenge 5].

This research proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by formulating scientific models as **adaptive differentiable layers** within neural networks. Instead of treating the scientific model as immutable or solely as a loss constraint, we propose to make key parameters *within* the scientific model (e.g., physical constants, coefficients, boundary condition parameters, reaction rates) learnable alongside the standard ML model parameters during end-to-end training.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop a Conceptual and Algorithmic Framework:** Formalize the integration of scientific models (represented by functions, ODEs, simplified PDEs, or simulation steps) as differentiable layers within neural network architectures, explicitly allowing for adaptivity of internal scientific parameters.
2.  **Implement Differentiable Scientific Layers:** Create proof-of-concept implementations of representative scientific models (e.g., from mechanics, thermodynamics, or chemical kinetics) as adaptive differentiable layers using modern automatic differentiation libraries.
3.  **Design and Implement Joint Optimization Strategy:** Develop and implement a robust gradient-based optimization strategy for jointly learning both the neural network parameters ($\theta_{ML}$) and the tunable scientific model parameters ($\theta_{Sci}$) from observational data.
4.  **Evaluate Performance and Adaptability:** Empirically evaluate the proposed hybrid model's performance in terms of prediction accuracy, generalization capabilities (especially under distributional shifts), and data efficiency compared to baseline models (pure ML, pure scientific model, standard PINNs). Critically, assess the model's ability to adapt its internal scientific parameters to match underlying data characteristics or varying conditions.
5.  **Assess Interpretability:** Analyze the learned scientific parameters ($\hat{\theta}_{Sci}$) to understand if they converge to physically meaningful values (when ground truth is known) or provide insights into discrepancies between the idealized model and real-world data.

**2.4 Significance**
This research will contribute to the methodological advancement of hybrid modeling, directly addressing the SynS & ML workshop's focus. By enabling scientific model components to adapt during training, we anticipate several significant impacts:
*   **Enhanced Model Accuracy and Applicability:** Allows scientific models to self-calibrate and correct for inaccuracies or idealized assumptions using data, broadening their deployment scope.
*   **Improved Data Efficiency and Generalization:** Leverages strong inductive biases from adaptable physics, potentially requiring less data and generalizing better than pure ML or rigidly constrained hybrid models.
*   **Increased Interpretability and Trust:** Provides insights through learned physical parameters, making the model's adaptations more transparent and trustworthy for domain experts.
*   **Facilitation of Scientific Discovery:** Deviations of learned parameters from expected values could highlight areas where existing scientific understanding is incomplete, potentially guiding new theoretical developments.
*   **A Bridge Between Communities:** Offers a concrete methodology that resonates with both ML researchers seeking robust, knowledge-infused models and domain scientists aiming to enhance their existing models with data-driven insights.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Conceptual Framework**
We propose a hybrid neural network architecture where a scientific model, $f_{Sci}$, is embedded as a distinct layer or block. Crucially, this layer is designed to be differentiable not only with respect to its inputs but also with respect to a set of internal *tunable parameters*, $\theta_{Sci}$. These parameters represent aspects of the scientific model that might be uncertain, variable, or require calibration (e.g., friction coefficients, heat transfer rates, reaction constants, material properties, simplified model coefficients). The overall hybrid model, $f_{Hybrid}$, can take various forms, for example:

*   **Serial Integration:** $y = f_{NN2}(f_{Sci}(f_{NN1}(x; \theta_{NN1}); \theta_{Sci}); \theta_{NN2})$
*   **Parallel Integration / Residual Correction:** $y = f_{Sci}(x; \theta_{Sci}) + f_{NN}(x; \theta_{ML})$
*   **Internal Component Replacement:** A complex scientific simulation might have a sub-component replaced or augmented by an NN, with parameters $\theta_{Sci}$ governing other parts of the simulation.

For clarity, let's focus on a structure where an NN preprocesses input or acts on the output of the adaptive scientific layer: $y = f_{NN}(f_{Sci}(x; \theta_{Sci}); \theta_{ML})$. Here, $x$ is the input, $y$ is the prediction, $\theta_{ML}$ are the parameters of the neural network components (e.g., weights and biases), and $\theta_{Sci}$ are the learnable parameters embedded within the scientific layer.

The core idea is that during training, gradient information flows back through the entire network, including the scientific layer $f_{Sci}$, updating both $\theta_{ML}$ and $\theta_{Sci}$ simultaneously to minimize a loss function based on observational data.

**3.2 Mathematical Formulation**
Let the hybrid model be represented as $y_{\text{pred}} = f_{Hybrid}(x; \Theta)$, where $\Theta = \{\theta_{ML}, \theta_{Sci}\}$ represents the complete set of learnable parameters. Given a dataset $D = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ of input-output pairs, the objective is to find the optimal parameters $\Theta^*$ by minimizing a loss function $\mathcal{L}(\Theta)$:

$$
\Theta^* = \arg \min_{\Theta} \mathcal{L}(\Theta) = \arg \min_{\theta_{ML}, \theta_{Sci}} \left[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \mathcal{L}_{data}(y_i, f_{Hybrid}(x_i; \theta_{ML}, \theta_{Sci})) + \mathcal{R}(\theta_{ML}, \theta_{Sci}) \right]
$$

where:
*   $\mathcal{L}_{data}$ is a data fidelity term, measuring the discrepancy between predictions and observations (e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE): $\mathcal{L}_{data}(y, y_{\text{pred}}) = ||y - y_{\text{pred}}||^2$).
*   $\mathcal{R}$ is an optional regularization term, which could penalize complexity of $\theta_{ML}$ (e.g., L2 regularization) or enforce constraints/priors on $\theta_{Sci}$ (e.g., ensuring positivity of physical parameters, or penalizing large deviations from known values).

The optimization is performed using gradient-based methods (e.g., Adam, SGD). The key step is computing the gradients with respect to both sets of parameters:

$$
\nabla_{\theta_{ML}} \mathcal{L} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta_{ML}}
$$
$$
\nabla_{\theta_{Sci}} \mathcal{L} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta_{Sci}}
$$

The computation requires the Jacobian of the scientific layer $f_{Sci}$ with respect to its inputs *and* its parameters $\theta_{Sci}$. This is enabled by implementing $f_{Sci}$ using differentiable programming constructs.

**3.3 Differentiable Scientific Layer Implementation ($f_{Sci}$)**
The implementation of $f_{Sci}$ will depend on the nature of the scientific model:

*   **Algebraic Equations / Functions:** If the model consists of explicit mathematical functions (e.g., constitutive laws, simplified physics equations), these can be directly implemented using operations supported by automatic differentiation libraries (e.g., `torch.sin`, `tf.exp`, JAX equivalents). $\theta_{Sci}$ would represent coefficients or constants within these equations.
*   **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):** For models described by ODEs, $\frac{dz}{dt} = g(z, t; \theta_{Sci})$, we can use differentiable ODE solvers (e.g., `torchdiffeq`, `DiffEqFlux.jl`, JAX-based solvers). These solvers compute the forward solution and use adjoint sensitivity methods or direct backpropagation through the solver steps to efficiently compute gradients $\frac{\partial z(T)}{\partial z(0)}$ and $\frac{\partial z(T)}{\partial \theta_{Sci}}$, where $z(T)$ is the solution at time $T$. $\theta_{Sci}$ could represent parameters within the function $g$.
*   **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):** For simple PDEs, methods like finite differences or finite elements can be implemented differentiably. The discretization scheme itself becomes part of the computational graph. $\theta_{Sci}$ could represent parameters in the PDE (e.g., diffusion coefficient, wave speed), boundary condition parameters, or even parameters of a closure model. This approach is related to differentiable physics simulators [1]. More complex PDE solvers might require specialized techniques or surrogate modeling.
*   **Simulation Steps:** If the scientific model involves iterative algorithms or specific numerical schemes (e.g., a single step of a climate model's physics parameterization), these steps can potentially be implemented differentiably if they consist of compatible operations.

We will leverage libraries like JAX or PyTorch for their automatic differentiation capabilities and ecosystem support (e.g., differentiable ODE solvers). Initial implementations will focus on simpler, well-understood scientific models (e.g., damped harmonic oscillator with learnable damping/frequency, reaction kinetics with learnable rates, simplified advection-diffusion with learnable coefficients) to clearly demonstrate the concept.

**3.4 Experimental Design**

*   **Datasets:**
    1.  **Synthetic Datasets:** Generate data from known scientific models (e.g., ODE systems, simple PDE solutions) where the ground truth parameters $\theta_{Sci}^*$ are known. This allows direct evaluation of parameter recovery. We will introduce noise and vary the underlying $\theta_{Sci}^*$ in different dataset regimes (e.g., training on data from systems with low damping, testing on high damping) to assess adaptation and generalization.
    2.  **Benchmark Scientific Datasets:** Utilize established datasets from relevant domains if available and appropriately scoped (e.g., benchmark fluid dynamics simulation results, simplified climate model output, reaction data). This will test the approach on more realistic, potentially complex data patterns.

*   **Baseline Models:**
    1.  **Pure ML Model:** A standard neural network (e.g., MLP, LSTM, or CNN depending on data structure) trained solely on the data, without explicit physics knowledge.
    2.  **Standard Scientific Model:** The scientific model $f_{Sci}$ with fixed, literature-based or *a priori* estimated parameters $\theta_{Sci}^{fixed}$.
    3.  **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN):** An NN trained with the scientific model's governing equations included as a residual term in the loss function [5], using fixed $\theta_{Sci}^{fixed}$.
    4.  **Proposed Adaptive Hybrid Model:** The $f_{Hybrid}$ model with jointly learned $\theta_{ML}$ and $\theta_{Sci}$.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Prediction Accuracy:** Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on held-out test data.
    2.  **Generalization Error:** Accuracy on out-of-distribution (OOD) test datasets (e.g., data generated with different $\theta_{Sci}^*$, extrapolated time ranges, different initial/boundary conditions).
    3.  **Data Efficiency:** Plot accuracy curves against varying training dataset sizes (e.g., 10%, 25%, 50%, 100% of available data).
    4.  **Parameter Recovery (Synthetic Data):** Relative error $||\hat{\theta}_{Sci} - \theta_{Sci}^*|| / ||\theta_{Sci}^*||$ for learned parameters on synthetic datasets. Analyze bias and variance of estimated parameters.
    5.  **Interpretability Analysis:** Examine the learned $\hat{\theta}_{Sci}$ values. Do they converge to meaningful physical values? How do they adapt when trained on data reflecting different physical regimes?
    6.  **Physical Consistency:** Measure adherence to known physical laws or invariants (e.g., conservation of energy/mass) in the model's predictions, even if not explicitly enforced in the loss beyond the structure of $f_{Sci}$.
    7.  **Computational Cost:** Training time, number of parameters, inference speed. Compare complexity against baselines, especially PINNs [Lit Review Challenge 4].

*   **Specific Experiments:**
    1.  **Parameter Identification:** Train the adaptive hybrid model on synthetic data with known $\theta_{Sci}^*$. Evaluate parameter recovery accuracy and prediction performance.
    2.  **Adaptation to Regime Shift:** Train on data from one physical regime (e.g., $\theta_{Sci}^A$) and fine-tune or evaluate on data from another regime ($\theta_{Sci}^B$). Compare the adaptive model's ability to adjust $\hat{\theta}_{Sci}$ versus baselines.
    3.  **Performance Comparison:** Systematically compare the adaptive model against all baselines across metrics (accuracy, generalization, data efficiency) on both synthetic and benchmark datasets.
    4.  **Ablation Study:** Compare the full adaptive model against variants (e.g., fixing $\theta_{Sci}$ after initialization, removing regularization on $\theta_{Sci}$) to understand the contribution of parameter adaptivity.
    5.  **Sensitivity Analysis:** Analyze the sensitivity of learned $\hat{\theta}_{Sci}$ to noise levels, data scarcity, and initialization strategies.

It directly contributes to the methodological studies sought by the SynS & ML workshop.
*   **Enhanced Scientific Modeling:** Provide domain scientists with a powerful tool to refine their existing models using observational data, leading to more accurate simulations and predictions in fields like climate science, fluid dynamics, systems biology, materials science, and engineering. The "self-calibrating" nature could significantly accelerate model development and deployment.
*   **More Robust and Trustworthy AI:** By grounding ML models with adaptable domain knowledge, this approach can lead to AI systems that are more robust, generalize better, and whose decisions are more interpretable through the lens of underlying scientific principles, addressing trustworthiness concerns [Lit Review Challenge 1].
*   **Accelerated Scientific Discovery:** The framework could help identify regimes where current scientific models are inadequate by observing how learned parameters deviate from expected values, thus guiding future theoretical or experimental research.
*   **Fostering Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** The proposed framework acts as a concrete bridge between ML and scientific domain expertise, potentially lowering the barrier for collaboration and enabling the co-design of more effective models, aligning perfectly with the "rendezvous" goal of the SynS & ML workshop.

While challenges like computational complexity [Lit Review Challenge 4] and ensuring identifiability of all parameters exist, the potential benefits of creating truly adaptive, physically-grounded, and data-aware models offer a compelling direction for future research at the confluence of scientific modeling and machine learning. Future work could also explore integrating uncertainty quantification techniques [3] within this adaptive framework.
