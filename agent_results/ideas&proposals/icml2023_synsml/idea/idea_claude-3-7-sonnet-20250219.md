# Physics-Informed Neural Operators for Multi-scale Fluid Dynamics

## Motivation
Traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models struggle with multi-scale phenomena, requiring prohibitive computational resources for high-fidelity simulations. Meanwhile, pure data-driven approaches often fail to generalize beyond training conditions and violate fundamental physical principles. This research addresses the critical need for accurate, efficient, and physically consistent models that can handle complex fluid dynamics across varying scales and boundary conditionsâ€”essential for climate modeling, aerospace engineering, and biomedical applications.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel framework combining Neural Operators (which learn mappings between function spaces) with physics-informed constraints through differentiable numerical solvers. Our approach embeds Navier-Stokes equations as soft constraints in the neural architecture while learning correction terms for sub-grid scale phenomena from high-resolution simulation data. The framework features a multi-resolution attention mechanism that dynamically focuses computational resources on regions with complex dynamics. By decomposing the solution into physically-interpretable components, we maintain analytical guarantees while leveraging data-driven insights. This hybrid approach offers orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CFD while maintaining physical consistency and generalization capabilities. We will validate the method on turbulent flow problems, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict flow patterns under previously unseen boundary conditions and physical parameters.
