Title: Hybrid Residual Neural Operator for Scientific Simulators

Motivation:  
Scientific simulators (e.g., climate, fluid dynamics) encode rich domain knowledge but are computationally intensive and often miscalibrated by simplifying assumptions. Pure data-driven models, while fast, struggle outside their training distribution. A lean hybrid approach can leverage existing simulators to guide neural operators, reducing data requirements, correcting systematic biases, and accelerating inference.

Main Idea:  
We propose a two‐stage operator learning framework. First, run the scientific simulator over a coarse parameter grid to generate paired inputs and outputs. Train a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) as a surrogate to approximate this mapping. Second, learn a lightweight residual network that ingests the FNO’s coarse prediction and raw inputs to model the simulator’s systematic errors. Both modules are trained end-to-end with physics-informed loss terms (e.g., conservation laws) and uncertainty quantification via dropout ensembles. At inference, the hybrid model delivers near-simulator accuracy at orders-of-magnitude faster speeds and adapts to new parameter regimes with minimal fine-tuning. This approach broadens simulator applicability, guides experimental design, and democratizes large-scale scientific modeling.
