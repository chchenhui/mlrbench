**Title:** Differentiable Scientific Models as Adaptive Layers for Hybrid Learning  

**Motivation:** Scientific models offer domain-specific constraints but are often rigid, while ML models lack interpretability and require vast data. Integrating scientific models as trainable components within ML frameworks can enhance adaptability, accuracy, and trustworthiness in applications like climate science or healthcare, where partial domain knowledge exists but real-world complexity demands flexibility.  

**Main Idea:** Embed scientific models (e.g., differential equations, physics simulations) as differentiable layers in neural networks. This enables end-to-end gradient-based optimization, where both the ML parameters *and* tunable scientific model parameters (e.g., coefficients, boundary conditions) are jointly learned from data. For instance, a climate prediction model could combine a differentiable atmospheric physics layer with neural networks capturing unresolved small-scale processes. The scientific layerâ€™s gradients guide ML training, ensuring physical consistency, while ML components refine inaccuracies in the scientific model. Expected outcomes include improved out-of-domain generalization, interpretability via grounded scientific parameters, and reduced reliance on large datasets. Impact: Enables "self-calibrating" hybrid models that leverage domain principles while adapting to real-world data, accelerating discoveries in fields like biomedicine and engineering.
