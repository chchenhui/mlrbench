1. **Title**: AutoElicit: Using Large Language Models for Expert Prior Elicitation in Predictive Modelling (arXiv:2411.17284)
   - **Authors**: Alexander Capstick, Rahul G. Krishnan, Payam Barnaghi
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces AutoElicit, a method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract knowledge and construct informative priors for predictive models. The approach aims to reduce the sample complexity of learning through Bayesian inference by generating priors that can be refined using natural language. The authors demonstrate that AutoElicit substantially reduces error over uninformative priors and outperforms in-context learning, saving significant labeling effort in applications like healthcare.

   - **Authors**: Tennison Liu, Nicol√°s Astorga, Nabeel Seedat, Mihaela van der Schaar
   - **Summary**: The authors present LLAMBO, a novel approach that integrates the capabilities of LLMs within Bayesian Optimization (BO). By framing the BO problem in natural language, LLAMBO enables LLMs to iteratively propose and evaluate promising solutions conditioned on historical evaluations. The method enhances surrogate modeling and candidate sampling, particularly in the early stages of search when observations are sparse, and is validated on hyperparameter tuning tasks.
