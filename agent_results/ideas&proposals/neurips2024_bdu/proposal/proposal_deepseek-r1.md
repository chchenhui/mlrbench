**Research Proposal: Large Language Model-Guided Prior Elicitation for Scalable Bayesian Optimization**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing expensive black-box functions, with applications ranging from hyperparameter tuning to drug discovery. Its efficiency hinges on the surrogate model (typically a Gaussian Process, GP) and the acquisition function, which balances exploration and exploitation. A critical yet understudied challenge is the specification of *informative priors* for the GP, which encode domain knowledge and guide the optimization process. Poorly chosen priors can lead to slow convergence or suboptimal solutions, particularly in high-dimensional or poorly understood search spaces.  

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for automating prior elicitation. LLMs, trained on vast scientific and technical corpora, can synthesize domain-specific knowledge from natural language problem descriptions (e.g., "optimize a high-temperature superconducting material with low cost"). By leveraging this capability, we can generate priors that reflect nuanced constraints and historical patterns, bypassing the need for manual expert input.  

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal aims to:  
1. Develop a framework for **LLM-guided prior elicitation** in BO, translating natural language problem descriptions into structured GP priors (kernel choices, hyperparameters, and input space constraints).  
2. Validate the framework’s ability to reduce the number of function evaluations required for convergence compared to standard BO baselines.  
3. Investigate the generalizability of the approach across domains (e.g., materials science, drug discovery) and its robustness to noisy or ambiguous problem descriptions.  

**Significance**  
The integration of LLMs into BO addresses two critical gaps:  
- **Democratization**: Non-experts can deploy BO effectively by describing their problem in natural language.  
- **Scalability**: LLMs enable the encoding of complex, domain-specific knowledge into priors, improving optimization efficiency in high-dimensional spaces.  
This work bridges the gap between probabilistic machine learning and generative AI, advancing the deployment of Bayesian methods in real-world scientific and industrial applications.

### 2. **Methodology**  

**Research Design**  
The proposed framework consists of three stages: (1) **Prior Elicitation** via LLMs, (2) **Bayesian Optimization** with LLM-generated priors, and (3) **Validation** through benchmark and real-world tasks.  

#### **Stage 1: LLM-Guided Prior Elicitation**  
- **Input**: Natural language description of the optimization task (e.g., "Design a molecule with high binding affinity to protein X and solubility > 10 mg/L").  
- **LLM Processing**:  
  - A pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3) is prompted to:  
    1. Identify relevant input dimensions and constraints.  
    2. Propose kernel functions (e.g., Matérn, spectral mixture) suited to the problem’s smoothness and periodicity.  
    3. Suggest hyperparameter ranges (e.g., length scales, output scales) based on domain knowledge.  
  - Example prompt structure:  
    ```  
    "You are a materials scientist optimizing a superconducting material. Based on prior research, suggest a kernel function for modeling its electrical conductivity as a function of temperature and doping concentration. Justify your choice."  
    ```  
- **Output Parsing**:  
  - The LLM’s text response is parsed into a structured prior configuration using rule-based or fine-tuned classifiers.  
  - For hyperparameters, the LLM generates distributions (e.g., "length scale: LogNormal(μ=1.2, σ=0.3)") or constrained ranges.  

#### **Stage 2: Bayesian Optimization with LLM Priors**  
- **GP Surrogate Model**:  
  The GP prior is defined as:  
  $$f(\mathbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{GP}\left(\mu(\mathbf{x}), k(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}')\right),$$  
  where $\mu(\mathbf{x})$ is the mean function (often zero-mean), and $k(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}')$ is the LLM-suggested kernel.  
- **Acquisition Function**:  
  Expected Improvement (EI) is used to select the next evaluation point:  
  $$\alpha_{\text{EI}}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}\left[\max(f(\mathbf{x}) - f(\mathbf{x}^+), 0)\right],$$  
  where $f(\mathbf{x}^+)$ is the current best observation.  
- **Adaptation Mechanism**:  
  If the LLM-generated prior leads to poor initial performance (e.g., low predictive likelihood on early samples), the framework falls back to a default prior (e.g., isotropic Matérn kernel) and updates the LLM’s prompt with feedback.  

#### **Stage 3: Experimental Validation**  
- **Benchmark Tasks**:  
  - **Synthetic Functions**: Branin, Hartmann-6, and Levy functions with added noise.  
  - **High-Dimensional Problems**: Robot pushing (15D), aircraft design (10D).  
- **Real-World Applications**:  
  - **Drug Discovery**: Optimizing molecular properties using the Olympus benchmark suite.  
  - **Material Design**: Maximizing thermoelectric efficiency via the Materials Project database.  
- **Baselines**:  
  Compare against standard BO (uninformative priors), human-expert priors, and state-of-the-art methods like BOHB and TuRBO.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  1. **Regret**: Cumulative and observed values and observed values and observed values.  
  2. **Convergence Speed**: Number of evaluations to reach 95% of the maximum objective.  
  3. **Prior Quality**: KL divergence between LLM-generated priors and expert-specified ground-truth priors (where available).  

**Algorithmic Workflow**  
1. **Input**: Natural language problem description $D$.  
2. **LLM Prior Elicitation**: Generate kernel $k$, hyperparameters $\theta$, and constraints $C$.  
3. **Initialize GP** with prior $p(f) = \mathcal{GP}(0, k(\theta))$.  
4. **For** $t = 1$ to $T$:  
   a. Select $\mathbf{x}_t = \arg\max \alpha_{\text{EI}}(\mathbf{x})$.  
   b. Observe $y_t = f(\mathbf{x}_t) + \epsilon$.  
   c. Update GP posterior $p(f | \mathbf{x}_{1:t}, y_{1:t})$.  
   d. If $t \mod M = 0$, refine LLM prior using accumulated data.  
5. **Output**: Optimal solution $\mathbf{x}^*$.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Convergence Efficiency**:  
   - LLM-guided priors will reduce the number of function evaluations by 20–40% compared to standard BO, particularly in early optimization stages.  
   - High-dimensional tasks will benefit most, as LLMs can identify low-effective dimensionality or hierarchical structures.  
2. **Robustness to Noisy Descriptions**:  
   - The framework will demonstrate tolerance to ambiguous or incomplete problem descriptions by leveraging LLMs’ ability to infer implicit constraints.  
3. **Generalizability**:  
   - Success in diverse domains (e.g., materials science, pharmacology) will validate the method’s adaptability, with minimal task-specific tuning.  

**Impact**  
- **Scientific Discovery**: Accelerate high-cost experiments (e.g., drug candidate screening) by reducing trial-and-error cycles.  
- **Industrial Applications**: Enable non-experts to deploy BO in manufacturing, aerospace, and energy systems.  
- **Methodological Advancements**: Establish a blueprint for integrating generative AI with probabilistic machine learning, fostering interdisciplinary research.  

**Challenges & Mitigation**  
- **LLM Hallucinations**: Implement consistency checks via ensemble prompting and validation against domain-specific databases.  
- **Computational Overhead**: Optimize LLM inference using quantization and caching mechanisms for real-time prior elicitation.  
- **Ethical Considerations**: Audit generated priors for biases (e.g., excluding unsafe chemical compounds) through human-in-the-loop verification.
