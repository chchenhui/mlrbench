1. **Title**: Diffusion-Driven Stochastic Control via Trajectory-Conditioned Generative Modeling  
2. **Motivation**: Traditional stochastic optimal control methods (e.g., MPC, POMDPs) struggle with high-dimensional, nonlinear systems under partial observability and complex noise distributions. Existing approaches often rely on simplified dynamics or restrictive assumptions (e.g., Gaussian noise), limiting their applicability to real-world robotics, autonomous systems, and finance. Generative diffusion models, however, excel at capturing intricate data distributions and long-term dependencies in sequential data. Bridging diffusion models with control theory could enable robust, data-driven control policies for uncertain, high-dimensional environments.  
3. **Main Idea**: Propose a framework where diffusion models are trained to generate future state trajectories conditioned on control inputs and historical observations. These generative models are then integrated into a stochastic control pipeline: (1) Learn a neural SDE/ODE to parameterize system dynamics using trajectory data; (2) Train a diffusion model to reverse the SDE and refine trajectory predictions; (3) Optimize control sequences by sampling diverse plausible futures from the diffusion model and minimizing a cost functional over these samples. The method leverages diffusionâ€™s ability to model non-Gaussian uncertainties and multi-modal distributions, enabling adaptive control under partial observability. Expected outcomes include improved robustness in robotic path planning, energy-efficient control for autonomous vehicles, and better handling of delayed/sparse feedback in financial systems. This unifies probabilistic inference and control, advancing applications where uncertainty quantification is critical.
