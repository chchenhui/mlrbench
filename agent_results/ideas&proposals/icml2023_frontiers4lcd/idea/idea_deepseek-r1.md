**Title:** Optimal Transport-Driven Neural ODEs for Robust Control Policies  

**Motivation:** Control systems often face challenges in handling distribution shifts and model uncertainties, particularly in real-world environments. Bridging Neural ODEs (which model continuous dynamics) with Optimal Transport (OT, which quantifies distance between distributions) could enable learning control policies that are robust to varying initial conditions or perturbations. This integration addresses the need for adaptable, theoretically grounded controllers in robotics, autonomous systems, and physics-based simulations.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a framework where Neural ODEs parameterize the time-evolving state distributions of dynamical systems, optimized via OT-based objectives to steer trajectories toward desired distributions. The system’s dynamics are governed by a Neural ODE, and its loss combines OT metrics (e.g., Wasserstein distance) between predicted and target state distributions with control cost penalties. Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) principles are integrated via adversarial perturbations during training to ensure robustness against uncertainties. This approach will be validated on tasks like robotic manipulation under variable friction or supply-chain optimization with stochastic demands. Expected outcomes include improved sample efficiency and stability in policy learning, along with theoretical guarantees on convergence. The work could unify OT’s geometric insights with Neural ODEs’ flexibility, advancing data-driven control for complex, non-stationary environments.
