## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** Meta-Learned Neuro-Symbolic Hierarchies for Robust Cross-Domain Planning and Generalization

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Sequential decision-making (SDM) represents a cornerstone challenge in Artificial Intelligence, encompassing tasks from robotic manipulation and navigation to complex game playing and logistical planning. Humans exhibit remarkable proficiency in SDM, rapidly adapting existing skills to novel situations and generalizing knowledge learned from limited experiences to solve entirely new problems (Lake et al., 2017). However, replicating this capability in artificial agents remains a long-standing open problem. Current state-of-the-art approaches often fall into two distinct paradigms, each with complementary strengths and weaknesses, creating a significant gap hindering the development of truly general-purpose AI.

On one hand, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved impressive results in complex, high-dimensional control tasks (Mnih et al., 2015; Silver et al., 2017). DRL methods excel at learning policies directly from raw sensory inputs and demonstrate strong performance in specific domains. However, they typically suffer from poor sample efficiency, requiring vast amounts of data to converge, and struggle with generalization and transferability to tasks or environments even slightly different from their training distribution (Cobbe et al., 2019). Their learned policies often lack interpretability and struggle with long-horizon reasoning where complex sequences of actions are needed.

On the other hand, the AI planning community has developed robust symbolic methods based on logical representations like PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) (McDermott et al., 1998). These methods leverage explicit domain models and search algorithms to generate plans that are provably correct (under model assumptions), highly generalizable across instances within a domain, and inherently interpretable. Symbolic planning excels at long-horizon reasoning and combinatorial task structures. However, crafting accurate symbolic models is often labor-intensive and brittle; these models struggle to capture the nuances of complex, continuous state-action spaces or adapt to unforeseen environmental dynamics, limiting their applicability in noisy, real-world scenarios. Furthermore, grounding abstract symbolic actions into low-level control remains a significant challenge.

Bridging this gap between data-driven learning and symbolic reasoning is crucial for developing AI systems capable of human-like generalization and adaptability in SDM. The Workshop on Generalization in Planning specifically calls for research addressing this synthesis, highlighting the need for novel formulations, representations, and learning algorithms that integrate the strengths of both fields. Neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy), which aims to combine neural networks' learning capabilities with symbolic reasoning's structure and interpretability, offers a promising avenue (Garcez & Lamb, 2020). Recent works like NeSyC (Choi et al., 2025) and Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer (Baheri & Alm, 2025) explore integrating symbolic structures with neural components for improved generalization and long-horizon planning. VisualPredicator (Liang et al., 2024) focuses on learning abstract neuro-symbolic world models. However, key challenges remain, particularly in ensuring effective alignment between symbolic abstractions and learned neural policy capabilities, achieving robust generalization across *different domains*, and maintaining sample efficiency during learning (as highlighted in the provided literature review).

This proposal directly addresses these challenges by introducing a novel **Meta-Learned Neuro-Symbolic Hierarchical (MeNeSyH)** framework. We propose a hierarchical system where a high-level symbolic planner operates over abstract action schemas defined in a PDDL-like language. These schemas are grounded by low-level neural sub-policies responsible for executing skills in the environment. Crucially, these sub-policies are trained using meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) across a diverse distribution of tasks and environments, enabling them to rapidly adapt to new situations. Our core innovations lie in (1) a bi-level optimization procedure to co-adapt the symbolic abstractions and the meta-learned sub-policies for seamless integration, (2) a contrastive meta-learning objective designed to disentangle task-invariant skill representations from task-specific adaptations within the sub-policies, enhancing generalization, and (3) a neuro-symbolic plan repair mechanism, potentially guided by Large Language Models (LLMs), to handle execution failures and refine plans based on real-time feedback.

**2.2 Research Objectives**
The primary goal of this research is to develop and evaluate the MeNeSyH framework to significantly improve generalization and sample efficiency in complex, long-horizon SDM tasks, particularly focusing on cross-domain transfer. Our specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop the MeNeSyH Framework:** Design and implement the hierarchical architecture combining a symbolic planner operating on abstract schemas with meta-learned neural sub-policies. Define the PDDL-like representation for symbolic actions and their grounding via sub-policies.
2.  **Implement Contrastive Meta-RL for Sub-Policies:** Develop and apply a novel contrastive meta-RL algorithm to train the neural sub-policies. The objective is to learn policies that can be rapidly adapted to new tasks while retaining a core of generalizable, task-invariant skills. This specifically targets the sample efficiency challenge.
3.  **Formulate and Solve the Bi-Level Optimization Problem:** Define and implement the bi-level optimization process to align the symbolic action representations (e.g., preconditions, effects, parameter spaces) with the actual capabilities and constraints of the meta-learned sub-policies. This addresses the critical alignment challenge.
4.  **Integrate Neuro-Symbolic Plan Repair:** Design a mechanism that detects sub-policy execution failures or constraint violations and triggers a repair process. Explore using LLMs to analyze failure contexts and suggest modifications to the high-level symbolic plan, integrating symbolic reasoning with learned execution feedback.
5.  **Evaluate Cross-Domain Generalization and Sample Efficiency:** Empirically validate the MeNeSyH framework on challenging benchmark environments (e.g., ProcTHOR, AI2-THOR, robotics simulators). Systematically assess its zero-shot and few-shot generalization capabilities across distinct domains and compare its sample efficiency against relevant baselines (pure RL, hierarchical RL, existing NeSy methods). This directly addresses the generalization challenge.
6.  **Investigate Formal Verification Aspects:** Explore lightweight formal verification techniques applicable at the symbolic level to check plan feasibility and constraint satisfaction before dispatching sub-policies, addressing the verification challenge within the scope of the symbolic layer.

**2.3 Significance**
This research holds significant potential for advancing the state-of-the-art in AI generalization for planning and decision-making.

*   **Bridging Paradigms:** It offers a principled approach to integrate the strengths of symbolic planning (generalization, long-horizon reasoning, interpretability) and deep reinforcement learning (adaptability, learning from raw data), directly addressing a central theme of the workshop.
*   **Enhanced Generalization:** By leveraging symbolic structure for high-level task decomposition and meta-learned sub-policies for adaptable execution, the framework is hypothesized to achieve superior zero-shot and few-shot generalization across diverse tasks and domains compared to existing methods.
*   **Improved Sample Efficiency:** The use of meta-learning and the reuse of symbolic schemas are expected to drastically reduce the data requirements for learning effective policies in new environments or tasks.
*   **Towards Deployable AI:** The hierarchical and neuro-symbolic nature enhances interpretability and facilitates debugging. The plan repair mechanism increases robustness, bringing us closer to AI systems deployable in complex, unpredictable real-world settings like robotics and autonomous systems.
*   **Methodological Contributions:** The proposed contrastive meta-RL technique and the bi-level optimization for neuro-symbolic alignment represent novel methodological contributions relevant to the broader machine learning, RL, and AI planning communities.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework**
The proposed MeNeSyH framework features a two-level hierarchy:

*   **High-Level Symbolic Planner:** Operates on a domain description defined using PDDL-like predicates and abstract action schemas (e.g., `(navigate ?room_start ?room_end)`, `(pickup ?object ?location)`, `(place ?object ?receptacle)`). Given a task goal specified in terms of desired predicates, a symbolic planner (e.g., an off-the-shelf heuristic search planner like FastDownward, adapted for interaction) generates a sequence of abstract actions (a symbolic plan).
*   **Low-Level Meta-Learned Sub-Policies:** Each symbolic action schema is associated with a neural sub-policy, $\pi_{\phi}(a_t | s_t, g_{sub})$, parameterized by $\phi$. These sub-policies are trained using meta-RL to achieve the corresponding sub-goal $g_{sub}$ (derived from the instantiated symbolic action) starting from the current state $s_t$. The meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to specific environment dynamics or task variations encountered during execution.

**Interaction Flow:**
1.  Given a task goal $G$, the symbolic planner generates an abstract plan $P = [act_1, act_2, ..., act_N]$.
2.  For each abstract action $act_i = \text{Schema}(param_1, ..., param_k)$ in $P$:
    a.  The corresponding sub-goal $g_{sub, i}$ is extracted (e.g., for `navigate(roomA, roomB)`, $g_{sub}$ could be "agent is in roomB").
    b.  The associated meta-learned sub-policy $\pi_{\phi_{Schema}}$ is invoked.
    c.  The sub-policy executes low-level actions $a_t$ in the environment until $g_{sub, i}$ is achieved or a failure condition is met.
    d.  (Optional) Formal verification checks satisfaction of intermediate state constraints derived from PDDL effects/invariants before proceeding.
3.  If a sub-policy fails (timeout, constraint violation, inability to achieve $g_{sub, i}$), the plan repair mechanism is invoked.
4.  If all actions succeed, the task goal $G$ is achieved.

**3.2 Symbolic Layer**
We will use a PDDL-inspired representation.
*   **Predicates:** Define the state space symbolically (e.g., `(At ?agent ?loc)`, `(In ?obj ?recep)`, `(IsClean ?obj)`). Predicates will be grounded through perception modules (potentially learned, inspired by VisualPredicator (Liang et al., 2024)) that map raw observations to symbolic facts.
*   **Action Schemas:** Define high-level actions with parameters, preconditions, and effects (e.g., `(:action navigate :parameters (?from ?to) :precondition (At ?agent ?from) :effect (and (At ?agent ?to) (not (At ?agent ?from))))`). These effects define the expected symbolic state transition.
*   **Planning Algorithm:** We will start with a classical planner (e.g., based on heuristic search) capable of generating plans composed of these abstract actions. The planner's heuristic might be informed by the learned sub-policies' expected costs or success probabilities.

**3.3 Neural Sub-policy Layer: Contrastive Meta-Reinforcement Learning**
Sub-policies will be represented by neural networks (e.g., LSTMs or Transformers, similar to Baheri & Alm, 2025) that map state observations and sub-goals to low-level actions.

**Meta-Learning Objective:** We employ a meta-RL algorithm (e.g., MAML (Finn et al., 2017), ProMP (Rothfuss et al., 2019)) to train the sub-policy parameters $\phi$. The goal is to learn an initialization $\phi$ that can be quickly adapted to specific tasks $\mathcal{T}_i$ drawn from a distribution $p(\mathcal{T})$.

**Contrastive Disentanglement:** To enhance generalization, we propose a novel contrastive objective during meta-training. We hypothesize that a sub-policy's internal representation $z = f_{\phi}(s_t, g_{sub})$ can be decomposed into a task-invariant component $z_{inv}$ capturing the core skill essence (e.g., the general mechanics of navigation) and a task-specific component $z_{spec}$ capturing context-dependent adaptations (e.g., obstacle avoidance patterns specific to an environment layout).
Let $\mathcal{D}_{meta} = \{ \mathcal{D}_i \}_{i=1}^M$ be the meta-training dataset, where each $\mathcal{D}_i$ contains experience from task $\mathcal{T}_i$. We augment standard meta-RL loss $\mathcal{L}_{MRL}$ with a contrastive loss $\mathcal{L}_{CON}$:
$$ \mathcal{L}_{TOTAL} = \mathcal{L}_{MRL} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{CON} $$
The contrastive loss aims to:
1.  Pull together $z_{inv}$ representations from different tasks executing the *same* symbolic action schema.
2.  Push apart $z_{inv}$ representations from *different* action schemas.
3.  Pull together $z_{spec}$ representations from the *same* task $\mathcal{T}_i$, even across different schemas if applicable (e.g., environment dynamics).
4.  Push apart $z_{spec}$ representations from *different* tasks $\mathcal{T}_i$.

We can formulate this using InfoNCE loss (Oord et al., 2018). For instance, for task-invariance for a schema $S$:
$$ \mathcal{L}_{CON}^{inv} = - \sum_{i, j \neq i} \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_{inv, i}^S, z_{inv, j}^S) / \tau)}{\sum_{k \neq i} \exp(\text{sim}(z_{inv, i}^S, z_{inv, k}^S) / \tau) + \sum_{S' \neq S, l} \exp(\text{sim}(z_{inv, i}^S, z_{inv, l}^{S'}) / \tau)} $$
where $z_{inv, i}^S$ is the invariant representation for schema $S$ in task $\mathcal{T}_i$, $\text{sim}$ is a similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity), and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter. A similar loss $\mathcal{L}_{CON}^{spec}$ is defined for $z_{spec}$. The decomposition $z = [z_{inv}, z_{spec}]$ can be enforced structurally in the network or via regularization.

**3.4 Neuro-Symbolic Alignment: Bi-Level Optimization**
Aligning the symbolic action definitions (preconditions $\mathcal{P}$, effects $\mathcal{E}$, parameter feasible ranges $\Theta_{param}$) with the true capabilities of the meta-learned sub-policies $\pi_{\phi^*}$ is crucial. Discrepancies lead to symbolic plans that are unrealizable by the low-level policies. We propose a bi-level optimization approach:

*   **Inner Loop:** Meta-train the sub-policy parameters $\phi$ to minimize the meta-RL objective $\mathcal{L}_{inner} = \mathcal{L}_{MRL}(\phi | \theta_{sym}) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{CON}(\phi | \theta_{sym})$, potentially influenced by the current symbolic definitions $\theta_{sym} = \{\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{E}, \Theta_{param}\}$. This yields optimal (adapted) sub-policies $\phi^*(\theta_{sym})$.
*   **Outer Loop:** Optimize the symbolic action schema parameters $\theta_{sym}$ to maximize the overall task success rate or minimize execution cost/failure rate when using the inner loop's optimized policies $\phi^*$.
    $$ \max_{\theta_{sym}} \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{T} \sim p(\mathcal{T})} \left[ \text{SuccessRate}( G_{\mathcal{T}} | \text{Planner}( \theta_{sym} ), \pi_{\phi^*(\theta_{sym})} ) \right] $$
    Or minimize a surrogate loss $\mathcal{L}_{outer}$ reflecting planning failures due to misalignment (e.g., precondition violations detected during execution, sub-policy failures on theoretically valid actions).

Solving this bi-level problem is computationally challenging. We will explore:
*   Iterative methods: Alternate between optimizing $\phi$ (inner loop, standard meta-RL) and optimizing $\theta_{sym}$ (outer loop, potentially using gradient-based methods if differentiability allows, or gradient-free methods like evolutionary algorithms or Bayesian optimization).
*   Gradient approximation techniques for the outer loop based on the inner loop's dynamics.
*   Regularization terms in the inner loop that encourage policies consistent with current symbolic definitions.

This addresses the alignment and computational complexity challenges identified.

**3.5 Neuro-Symbolic Plan Repair**
When a sub-policy $\pi_{\phi_{Schema}}$ fails to execute $act_i$:
1.  **Failure Detection:** Identify failure type (timeout, constraint violation, unmet sub-goal).
2.  **Contextual Information:** Extract relevant state information $s_{fail}$, intended sub-goal $g_{sub, i}$, symbolic action $act_i$, and the partially executed plan $P_{prefix} = [act_1, ..., act_{i-1}]$.
3.  **LLM-Guided Refinement (Exploration):** Query an LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) with the context and failure information, prompting it to suggest modifications to the symbolic plan *around* the failure point (e.g., "Sub-policy for `pickup(apple, counter)` failed because the apple rolled off. Suggest alternative symbolic actions or parameters."). Potential suggestions: insert intermediate actions (e.g., `open(drawer)` if object might be inside), modify parameters (e.g., try `pickup(apple, floor)`), or replan from $s_{fail}$ with updated symbolic state information reflecting the failure. Inspired by NeSyC's use of LLMs (Choi et al., 2025).
4.  **Validation and Integration:** Validate the LLM's suggestion(s) symbolically (check preconditions) and potentially attempt execution of the revised plan segment. If successful, update the plan; otherwise, mark the state/action as problematic for the symbolic planner and trigger full replanning.

**3.6 Formal Verification Aspects**
We will integrate lightweight formal checks at the symbolic level:
*   **Precondition Checking:** Before invoking a sub-policy for $act_i$, verify if its symbolic preconditions $\mathcal{P}_i$ hold in the current grounded symbolic state.
*   **State Invariant Monitoring:** Define safety invariants (e.g., `(not (holding ?agent ?sharp_object))` during navigation). Check these invariants symbolically based on predicted intermediate states derived from action effects.
*   **Plan Validation:** Use standard PDDL validation tools on the generated high-level plan to ensure logical consistency before execution begins.
This addresses the formal verification challenge by leveraging the symbolic layer, although it doesn't fully verify the neural components' internal behavior.

**3.7 Data Collection and Simulation Environments**
We will utilize simulation environments that support procedural generation of diverse tasks and layouts, crucial for meta-learning and evaluating generalization.
*   **Primary Environments:** AI2-THOR (Kolve et al., 2017) / ProcTHOR (Deitke et al., 2022) for rich indoor interaction tasks. VirtualHome (Puig et al., 2018) for complex household activities.
*   **Robotics Simulators:** Potentially RLBench (James et al., 2020) or MuJoCo/RoboSuite (Todorov et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2020) for evaluating transfer to different dynamics and manipulation tasks.
*   **Data Generation:** Procedurally generate variations in object placements, room layouts, goal specifications, and potentially slight variations in object properties or physics across meta-training tasks.

**3.8 Experimental Design**
We will conduct a series of experiments to evaluate MeNeSyH against strong baselines.

*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **End-to-End Meta-RL:** Meta-RL agents (e.g., MAML-PPO, PEARL) trained directly on the tasks without symbolic structure.
    2.  **Hierarchical RL (HRL):** Standard HRL methods (e.g., HIRO, HAC) where high-level policies learn to set sub-goals for low-level policies, but without explicit symbolic planning.
    3.  **Standard Neuro-Symbolic:** Approaches like the Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer (Baheri & Alm, 2025) or simplified versions of NeSyC (Choi et al., 2025), potentially reimplemented in our benchmark environments for fair comparison.
    4.  **Ablation Studies:** Versions of MeNeSyH without contrastive learning, without bi-level optimization (using fixed schemas), and without plan repair.

*   **Evaluation Tasks:**
    1.  **Intra-Domain Generalization:** Train on a set of tasks within one domain (e.g., tidying rooms in ProcTHOR) and test on unseen configurations/goal objects within the *same* domain. Measure zero-shot and few-shot (allowing minimal adaptation steps) performance.
    2.  **Cross-Domain Generalization:** Train on tasks in one domain (e.g., cooking tasks in simulation) and test on significantly different tasks or domains (e.g., office organization tasks, potentially requiring reuse of `navigate`, `pickup`, `place` schemas but with different objects, receptacles, and constraints). This is the key test of our hypothesis.
    3.  **Long-Horizon Tasks:** Design tasks requiring long sequences of actions where intermediate sub-goals must be achieved correctly.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Success Rate (SR):** Percentage of tasks completed successfully.
    2.  **Sample Efficiency:** Number of environment interactions or adaptation steps required to reach a target performance level on new tasks/domains.
    3.  **Generalization Gap:** Difference in performance between training tasks and unseen testing tasks (lower is better).
    4.  **Planning Time:** Computational time taken by the symbolic planner.
    5.  **Execution Steps/Time:** Number of low-level actions or wall-clock time required for task completion.
    6.  **Constraint Violation Rate:** Frequency of violating predefined safety or state constraints during execution.
    7.  **Sub-policy Failure Rate:** Frequency with which sub-policies fail to achieve their assigned sub-goals.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**
Based on the proposed methodology, we anticipate the following outcomes:

1.  **Demonstration of Superior Generalization:** MeNeSyH will exhibit significantly higher zero-shot and few-shot success rates on cross-domain and complex long-horizon tasks compared to end-to-end (meta-)RL and standard HRL baselines. The combination of symbolic structure and meta-learned adaptability is expected to be key.
2.  **Improved Sample Efficiency:** The framework will require substantially fewer environment interactions to adapt to new tasks or domains compared to baselines, owing to the meta-learning approach and the reuse of learned sub-policies guided by the symbolic planner.
3.  **Effective Neuro-Symbolic Alignment:** The bi-level optimization process will demonstrably improve the alignment between symbolic action definitions and the capabilities of the underlying neural policies, leading to more reliable planning and execution compared to systems with fixed or manually defined abstractions.
4.  **Robustness through Plan Repair:** The neuro-symbolic plan repair mechanism will increase overall task success rates by allowing the system to recover from unexpected sub-policy failures, outperforming systems without such a mechanism.
5.  **Quantifiable Benefits of Contrastive Learning:** Ablation studies will show that the contrastive meta-learning objective leads to more disentangled and generalizable sub-policy representations, contributing measurably to cross-domain transfer performance.
6.  **A Flexible Open-Source Framework:** We plan to release the code for the MeNeSyH framework, providing a valuable tool for the research community to build upon.

**4.2 Impact**
This research aims to make significant contributions to multiple communities and AI capabilities:

*   **Advancing AI Planning and RL:** By providing a robust and effective method for integrating symbolic planning with meta-learned policies, this work will contribute directly to the goals of the Workshop on Generalization in Planning, fostering synergy between the AI planning and RL communities.
*   **Enabling More Capable Autonomous Systems:** The anticipated improvements in generalization, sample efficiency, and robustness are critical for developing practical AI agents, particularly in robotics, that can operate effectively in diverse, unstructured, and dynamic real-world environments with minimal task-specific retraining.
*   **Enhancing Interpretability and Trustworthiness:** The explicit symbolic layer provides a degree of interpretability regarding the agent's high-level strategy, while the formal verification checks add a layer of safety assurance, contributing to more trustworthy AI systems.
*   **New Research Directions:** This work will open up avenues for future research, including learning symbolic representations directly from interaction, extending formal verification to neural components, incorporating more sophisticated human-in-the-loop interaction for plan refinement, and scaling these methods to even more complex domains and real-world hardware.

While challenges related to the computational cost of bi-level optimization and the reliability of LLM-guided repair exist, the proposed methodology includes strategies to mitigate these. Successful completion of this research will represent a significant step towards AI systems that possess the flexible, generalizable planning and decision-making capabilities characteristic of human intelligence.
