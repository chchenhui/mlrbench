# Neuro-Symbolic Hierarchical Planning with Meta-Learned Sub-Policies for Cross-Domain Generalization

## Introduction

### Background

Sequential decision-making (SDM) is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence (AI), encompassing a wide range of applications from robotics to autonomous vehicles. Humans excel at SDM tasks, demonstrating remarkable abilities to generalize from limited examples and transfer learned skills to new, unseen problems. However, AI systems struggle with these tasks, particularly in long-horizon, cross-domain scenarios. Current AI systems predominantly rely on either data-driven reinforcement learning (RL) or symbolic planning approaches. Data-driven RL methods, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offer strong short-horizon reasoning and planning but are sample-inefficient and lack generalizability. Symbolic planning methods, on the other hand, provide sample-efficient generalizability and transferability but are rigid and struggle with short-horizon control.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to bridge the gap between data-driven RL and symbolic planning by developing a neuro-symbolic hierarchical planning framework that enhances cross-domain generalization and sample efficiency. The proposed framework will integrate a symbolic planner with meta-learned neural sub-policies to generate task-specific plans that are both adaptive and generalizable. The key innovations include bi-level optimization for aligning symbolic abstractions with sub-policy capabilities, contrastive meta-learning to disentangle task-invariant and task-specific policy components, and neuro-symbolic plan repair using Large Language Model (LLM)-guided refinement.

### Significance

This research has significant implications for advancing deployable AI systems that can generalize across tasks with minimal retraining. By unifying planning and RL communities, the proposed framework will enable AI agents to solve complex, long-horizon SDM tasks in diverse, real-world environments. The improved sample efficiency and cross-domain generalization will be particularly beneficial in robotics, where agents must adapt learned skills to unseen tasks with minimal data. The ability to integrate formal verification methods will also enhance safety and reliability, making the framework applicable to a wide range of critical domains.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed research will follow a systematic approach that combines theoretical analysis, algorithm development, and empirical evaluation. The methodology will consist of the following steps:

1. **Literature Review and State-of-the-Art Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive review of existing neuro-symbolic planning methods, meta-learning techniques, and formal verification approaches to identify gaps and opportunities for innovation.

2. **Framework Development**: Develop a neuro-symbolic hierarchical planning framework that integrates a symbolic planner with meta-learned neural sub-policies. The framework will include the following components:
   - **Symbolic Planner**: A symbolic planner that generates abstract task hierarchies using PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) representations.
   - **Meta-Learned Neural Sub-Policies**: A set of neural sub-policies trained via meta-reinforcement learning on diverse environments to embed adaptability into low-level execution.
   - **Bi-Level Optimization**: A bi-level optimization approach to align symbolic abstractions with sub-policy capabilities.
   - **Contrastive Meta-Learning**: A contrastive meta-learning algorithm to disentangle task-invariant and task-specific policy components.
   - **Neuro-Symbolic Plan Repair**: An LLM-guided refinement strategy to repair plans generated by the symbolic planner and neural sub-policies.

3. **Algorithm Development**: Develop the algorithms for each component of the framework, including the symbolic planner, meta-learning algorithm, bi-level optimization approach, and neuro-symbolic plan repair strategy.

4. **Experimental Design**: Design a set of experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The experiments will be conducted on cross-domain robotics benchmarks, such as ProcTHOR, to assess zero-shot generalization and sample efficiency. The evaluation metrics will include success rates, policy efficiency, and computational complexity.

5. **Empirical Evaluation**: Conduct the experiments and analyze the results to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Compare the performance of the framework with state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate its superiority in terms of cross-domain generalization and sample efficiency.

### Data Collection

The data for this research will consist of a diverse set of environments and tasks from the ProcTHOR benchmark, as well as other relevant datasets for cross-domain robotics. The environments will be designed to cover a wide range of task structures and environmental dynamics to evaluate the cross-domain generalization capabilities of the proposed framework.

### Algorithmic Steps

#### Symbolic Planner

The symbolic planner will generate abstract task hierarchies using PDDL representations. The planner will take as input a high-level task description and generate a sequence of abstract actions that can be executed by the neural sub-policies. The planner will also ensure that the generated plans adhere to global constraints and goals.

#### Meta-Learned Neural Sub-Policies

The meta-learned neural sub-policies will be trained via meta-reinforcement learning on a diverse set of environments. The training process will involve learning a set of policies that can be quickly adapted to new tasks with minimal data. The meta-learning algorithm will use a contrastive approach to disentangle task-invariant and task-specific policy components.

#### Bi-Level Optimization

The bi-level optimization approach will be used to align symbolic abstractions with sub-policy capabilities. The optimization process will involve iteratively refining the symbolic abstractions and sub-policies to minimize the discrepancy between their capabilities. The optimization will be performed using gradient-based methods, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

#### Contrastive Meta-Learning

The contrastive meta-learning algorithm will be used to disentangle task-invariant and task-specific policy components. The algorithm will involve training a meta-learner on a set of diverse tasks and then fine-tuning the meta-learner on new tasks. The contrastive approach will help the meta-learner to learn task-invariant features that can be generalized to new tasks.

#### Neuro-Symbolic Plan Repair

The neuro-symbolic plan repair strategy will use LLM-guided refinement to repair plans generated by the symbolic planner and neural sub-policies. The LLM will analyze the generated plans and suggest modifications to improve their performance. The modifications will be incorporated into the plans using a gradient-based approach.

### Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation metrics for this research will include:

- **Success Rate**: The proportion of tasks that are successfully completed by the proposed framework.
- **Policy Efficiency**: The average number of steps required to complete a task.
- **Sample Efficiency**: The amount of data required to achieve a given level of performance.
- **Computational Complexity**: The time and computational resources required to generate plans and execute the framework.
