# SYMERA: Symbolic Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Cross-Domain Generalization in Sequential Decision Making

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Sequential decision-making (SDM) problems are ubiquitous in artificial intelligence, ranging from robotic manipulation to household tasks and complex game-playing. While humans demonstrate remarkable capabilities in generalizing solutions across different problem instances and transferring skills to novel domains, AI systems continue to struggle with these challenges. The field is characterized by a significant divide between two primary approaches: data-driven reinforcement learning (RL) and symbolic planning.

Reinforcement learning approaches have shown impressive performance in specific domains but often require massive amounts of data and struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. Deep RL models excel at learning complex control policies for short-horizon tasks but typically fail to transfer these skills to new environments without substantial retraining. Conversely, classical AI planning techniques offer powerful formal methods for long-horizon reasoning and generalization across problems but lack the flexibility to adapt to noisy observations and continuous state-action spaces that characterize real-world environments.

This division has hampered progress in developing AI systems capable of human-like generalization in SDM tasks. Recent advances in neuro-symbolic AI suggest that integrating the complementary strengths of both paradigms may provide a path forward. By combining the robust generalization capabilities of symbolic reasoning with the adaptability of neural methods, we can potentially overcome the limitations of either approach in isolation.

### Research Objectives

This research proposal aims to develop SYMERA (SYMbolic mEta-Reinforcement leArning), a novel neuro-symbolic framework for generalizable sequential decision-making that bridges the gap between symbolic planning and reinforcement learning. The specific objectives are:

1. Design a hierarchical neuro-symbolic architecture that integrates a high-level symbolic planner with meta-learned neural sub-policies to enable both long-horizon planning and flexible execution.

2. Develop a bi-level optimization approach to align symbolic action schemas with neural policy capabilities, ensuring cohesive interaction between the symbolic and neural components.

3. Create a contrastive meta-learning algorithm that effectively disentangles task-invariant and task-specific components of policies, enhancing zero-shot generalization to novel tasks.

4. Implement a formal verification module that ensures constraint satisfaction and safety properties during plan execution in new domains.

5. Evaluate the framework's performance on cross-domain generalization benchmarks, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and generalization compared to existing methods.

### Significance

This research addresses a fundamental challenge in AI: enabling systems to generalize effectively across different sequential decision-making problems with minimal retraining. The proposed SYMERA framework has the potential to advance the field in several significant ways:

First, it offers a principled approach to integrating symbolic and neural methods, potentially unifying research directions in the planning and reinforcement learning communities. Second, the meta-learning component addresses the critical issue of sample efficiency, enabling systems to adapt to new domains with minimal data. Third, by incorporating formal verification, the framework enhances the reliability and safety of autonomous systems in deployment scenarios.

The practical implications of this research extend to numerous domains. In robotics, agents could leverage learned skills across different environments and tasks, dramatically reducing the need for task-specific training. In household assistants, systems could generalize knowledge across different homes and configurations. More broadly, this work contributes to the development of AI systems capable of human-like adaptation and generalization, a key milestone toward more capable and reliable artificial intelligence.

## 2. Methodology

Our methodology integrates symbolic planning, meta-reinforcement learning, and formal verification into a cohesive framework. We detail each component of SYMERA below.

### 2.1 Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Architecture

The SYMERA architecture consists of three primary layers:

1. **Symbolic Planning Layer**: This top-level component handles abstract task planning using a domain-independent PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) planner. It operates on a library of action schemas $\Sigma = \{\sigma_1, \sigma_2, ..., \sigma_n\}$, where each action schema $\sigma_i$ corresponds to a generalizable skill (e.g., "navigate," "grasp," "place").

2. **Meta-Learned Neural Policy Layer**: This middle layer contains a set of neural sub-policies $\Pi = \{\pi_1, \pi_2, ..., \pi_n\}$ where each $\pi_i$ implements the corresponding action schema $\sigma_i$. Each sub-policy is meta-trained across diverse environments to quickly adapt to new task instances.

3. **Execution and Monitoring Layer**: This bottom layer executes the selected sub-policies and monitors their performance, providing feedback to the planning layer for potential plan repair.

The formal definition of the framework is as follows:

- Let $\mathcal{S}$ represent the state space and $\mathcal{A}$ the primitive action space
- Let $\mathcal{G}$ be the space of goals that can be expressed in the symbolic language
- For a given goal $g \in \mathcal{G}$, the symbolic planner generates a plan $P_g = (\sigma_{i_1}, \sigma_{i_2}, ..., \sigma_{i_k})$ consisting of a sequence of action schemas
- Each action schema $\sigma_i$ is implemented by a corresponding neural policy $\pi_i: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{G}_i \rightarrow \Delta(\mathcal{A})$, where $\mathcal{G}_i$ is the space of sub-goals for action schema $\sigma_i$ and $\Delta(\mathcal{A})$ is a probability distribution over primitive actions

### 2.2 Bi-Level Optimization for Symbolic-Neural Alignment

A critical challenge in neuro-symbolic systems is ensuring that symbolic action schemas align with what the neural sub-policies can actually accomplish. We propose a bi-level optimization approach:

**Outer Loop**: Optimize the symbolic action schemas (preconditions and effects) based on empirical performance of neural policies.
**Inner Loop**: Meta-train neural sub-policies to implement the current action schemas effectively.

Formally, this optimization problem can be expressed as:

$$\min_{\Sigma, \Pi} \mathcal{L}(\Sigma, \Pi) = \mathcal{L}_{plan}(\Sigma) + \mathcal{L}_{exec}(\Pi | \Sigma) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{align}(\Sigma, \Pi)$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{plan}$ measures the quality of plans generated using the action schemas $\Sigma$
- $\mathcal{L}_{exec}$ measures the execution error of policies $\Pi$ when implementing the action schemas
- $\mathcal{L}_{align}$ is an alignment term that penalizes discrepancies between what actions claim to do (symbolically) and what they actually achieve (through neural execution)
- $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter balancing the alignment constraint

The alignment loss $\mathcal{L}_{align}$ is defined as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{align}(\Sigma, \Pi) = \mathbb{E}_{s,g} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \|eff(\sigma_i, s) - T(s, \pi_i(s, g_i))\|^2 \right]$$

Where $eff(\sigma_i, s)$ represents the expected effects of action schema $\sigma_i$ in state $s$, and $T(s, \pi_i(s, g_i))$ represents the actual state transition when executing policy $\pi_i$ from state $s$ with sub-goal $g_i$.

### 2.3 Contrastive Meta-Learning for Disentangled Representations

To enhance generalization across tasks, we develop a contrastive meta-learning approach that explicitly disentangles task-invariant and task-specific components of policies. This is achieved through a specialized neural architecture and training procedure:

1. **Architecture**: Each neural sub-policy $\pi_i$ is structured as:

$$\pi_i(a|s, g_i) = f_i(h_{inv}(s), h_{spec}(s, g_i))$$

Where:
- $h_{inv}: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{inv}$ is a task-invariant encoder that captures common features across tasks
- $h_{spec}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{G}_i \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{spec}$ is a task-specific encoder that captures goal-dependent features
- $f_i: \mathcal{H}_{inv} \times \mathcal{H}_{spec} \rightarrow \Delta(\mathcal{A})$ is a policy head that combines both representations

2. **Contrastive Meta-Learning Objective**: We train this architecture using a combination of task-based meta-learning and contrastive learning:

$$\mathcal{L}_{meta} = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim p(\tau)} \left[ -\log \pi_i(a|s, g_i; \theta) \right] + \beta \mathcal{L}_{contrast}$$

Where $\mathcal{L}_{contrast}$ is the contrastive loss defined as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{contrast} = -\mathbb{E}_{(s,g_i),(s',g_i')} \left[ \mathbb{1}_{[g_i=g_i']} \log \frac{e^{sim(h_{spec}(s,g_i), h_{spec}(s',g_i'))/\tau}}{\sum_{j} e^{sim(h_{spec}(s,g_i), h_{spec}(s_j,g_j))/\tau}} \right]$$

This contrastive objective encourages the task-specific encoder to group states associated with the same sub-goal together, while pushing apart representations for different sub-goals.

3. **Training Procedure**: We implement Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) with task-specific adaptation:

$$\theta_i' = \theta_i - \alpha \nabla_{\theta_i} \mathcal{L}_{\tau_i}(\theta_i)$$
$$\theta \leftarrow \theta - \beta \nabla_{\theta} \sum_{\tau_i \sim p(\tau)} \mathcal{L}_{\tau_i}(\theta_i')$$

Where $\tau_i$ represents task instances from a distribution $p(\tau)$, and $\alpha, \beta$ are learning rates.

### 2.4 Formal Verification Module

To ensure that executed plans adhere to safety constraints and domain-specific requirements, we incorporate a formal verification module that operates at two levels:

1. **Plan-Level Verification**: Before execution, the symbolic plan is verified against a set of requirements $\Phi = \{\phi_1, \phi_2, ..., \phi_m\}$ expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL). If the plan violates any requirement, it is refined using a symbolic plan repair mechanism.

2. **Execution-Level Verification**: During execution, the system continuously monitors for potential safety violations using a set of runtime monitors. When a violation is detected or predicted, the system triggers one of three responses:
   - Minor adjustment to the current sub-policy execution
   - Sub-goal revision within the current action schema
   - Plan repair at the symbolic level

Formally, we define a verification function $V: P \times \Phi \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ that returns 1 if plan $P$ satisfies all requirements in $\Phi$ and 0 otherwise. For runtime verification, we employ a predictive model $M$ that estimates the probability of constraint violation within a finite horizon:

$$M(s_t, \pi_i, \phi_j) = P(\exists t' \in [t, t+H] : \phi_j \text{ is violated} | s_t, \pi_i)$$

When this probability exceeds a predefined threshold, the system initiates the appropriate response mechanism.

### 2.5 Experimental Design

We will evaluate SYMERA across a diverse set of benchmarks designed to test cross-domain generalization in sequential decision-making:

1. **ProcTHOR**: A procedurally generated set of household environments with physics-based interaction, where agents must accomplish domestic tasks (cleaning, rearranging objects, etc.).

2. **Meta-World**: A benchmark of 50 robotic manipulation tasks with varying objects and objectives.

3. **MiniGrid-Generalization**: A customized version of MiniGrid with procedurally generated environments requiring navigation and interaction.

4. **Custom Cross-Domain Tasks**: We will create a set of novel tasks that specifically test transfer between significantly different domains (e.g., from virtual navigation to robotic manipulation).

#### Evaluation Metrics:

1. **Success Rate**: Percentage of tasks successfully completed in novel environments.

2. **Sample Efficiency**: Number of interactions required to adapt to new tasks, measured by:
   - Zero-shot performance (without any adaptation)
