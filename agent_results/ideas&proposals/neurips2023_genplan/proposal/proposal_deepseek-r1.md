**Neuro-Symbolic Hierarchical Planning with Meta-Learned Sub-Policies for Cross-Domain Generalization**  

---

### 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Sequential decision-making (SDM) in artificial intelligence faces a persistent tension between the adaptability of data-driven reinforcement learning (RL) and the generalizability of symbolic planning. While RL excels at short-horizon control in high-dimensional state spaces, it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, sample efficiency, and cross-task generalization. Conversely, symbolic planning algorithms (e.g., PDDL-based systems) enable robust long-horizon reasoning by leveraging domain-specific abstractions but often fail to adapt to real-world uncertainties. Bridging these paradigms is critical for applications like robotics, where agents must compose learned skills into hierarchical plans that transfer across domains with minimal retraining. Recent neuro-symbolic approaches (e.g., *Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer*, *VisualPredicator*) demonstrate promising results by combining symbolic abstraction with neural execution. However, challenges remain in aligning symbolic plan structures with adaptive sub-policies and enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen task configurations.  

**Research Objectives**  
This work proposes a neuro-symbolic framework to address these challenges through three objectives:  
1. **Bridging Symbolic and Neural Representations**: Develop a hierarchical planner where high-level symbolic action schemas are grounded in meta-learned neural sub-policies.  
2. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Enable zero-shot policy transfer by disentangling task-invariant skills (e.g., "grasp," "navigate") and task-specific compositions via contrastive meta-learning.  
3. **Formally Constrained Adaptability**: Integrate temporal logic verification and LLM-guided repair to ensure safety and feasibility during plan execution.  

**Significance**  
The proposed method unifies the sample efficiency of symbolic planning with the flexibility of RL, advancing AI systems toward human-like generalization in complex environments. By enabling cross-domain policy reuse, it reduces reliance on costly retraining in robotics, autonomous systems, and program synthesis. Additionally, the theoretical insights into bi-level optimization and neuro-symbolic alignment will inform broader research at the intersection of RL, planning, and formal methods.

### 2. Methodology  

#### 2.1 Neuro-Symbolic Architecture  
The framework comprises three layers:  
1. **Symbolic Planner**: Generates abstract task hierarchies using PDDL-like action schemas (e.g., $\texttt{(navigate ?start ?end)}$). Each schema is parameterized by $\theta_s$ and linked to a neural sub-policy.  
2. **Meta-Learned Sub-Policies**: A set of neural networks $\pi_{\phi_i}(a|s; \theta_n)$ trained via meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) on diverse environments. Each sub-policy executes a symbolic action (e.g., navigation or manipulation primitives).  
3. **Verification & Repair Module**: Uses linear temporal logic (LTL) to validate plans and an LLM-based refiner to correct violations (e.g., unmet preconditions).  

#### 2.2 Bi-Level Optimization for Symbolic-Neural Alignment  
To align symbolic abstractions with sub-policy capabilities, we formulate a bi-level optimization problem:  
- **Upper Level (Symbolic Abstraction)**: Optimize schema parameters $\theta_s$ to maximize plan feasibility:  
  $$\min_{\theta_s} \mathbb{E}_{p \sim \mathcal{P}} \left[ \mathcal{L}_{\text{feas}}(p(\theta_s)) \right],$$  
  where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{feas}}$ measures the gap between symbolic plans and sub-policy execution success rates.  
- **Lower Level (Sub-Policy Adaptation)**: Update neural parameters $\theta_n$ via meta-RL to minimize task loss for plans generated by $\theta_s$:  
  $$\min_{\theta_n} \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim p(\theta_s)} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t \mathcal{R}(s_t, a_t) \right].$$  
This hierarchy ensures symbolic plans remain executable while sub-policies adapt to their requirements.  

#### 2.3 Contrastive Meta-Learning for Disentangled Skills  
Sub-policies are trained using a contrastive meta-learning objective that separates task-invariant ($z_c$) and task-specific ($z_d$) latent factors:  
1. **Task Embedding**: For a task distribution $p(\mathcal{T})$, sample pairs of tasks $(\mathcal{T}_i, \mathcal{T}_j)$ with shared components.  
2. **Contrastive Loss**:  
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}} = -\log \frac{\exp(z_c^i \cdot z_c^j / \tau)}{\sum_{k} \exp(z_c^i \cdot z_c^k / \tau)},$$  
   where $\tau$ is a temperature parameter. This encourages $z_c$ to capture cross-task invariants (e.g., object affordances).  
3. **Meta-RL Objective**: Sub-policies are trained using MAML to adapt quickly to new tasks:  
   $$\min_\phi \sum_{\mathcal{T}_i \sim p(\mathcal{T})} \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(U_{\mathcal{T}_i}(\phi)),$$  
   where $U_{\mathcal{T}_i}$ is the adaptation operator for task $\mathcal{T}_i$.  

#### 2.4 Formal Verification and LLM-Guided Repair  
To ensure plans satisfy safety constraints:  
1. **Temporal Logic Constraints**: Represent safety rules as LTL formulas (e.g., $\square \lnot \text{collision}$).  
2. **Verification**: Check plan $p$ against constraints using a model checker. If violated, trigger repair.  
3. **LLM-Guided Refinement**: An LLM (e.g., GPT-4) proposes corrective actions by parsing the symbolic plan and environment context, generating candidate repairs (e.g., inserting $\texttt{(avoid-obstacle ?obj)}$).  

#### 2.5 Experimental Design  
**Benchmarks**: Evaluate on ProcTHOR (3D household environments), MetaWorld (robotic manipulation), and custom cross-domain tasks (e.g., kitchen-to-factory robot adaptation).  

**Baselines**: Compare against:  
- Pure RL (PPO, SAC)  
- Neuro-symbolic methods (Hierarchical Decision Transformer, VisualPredicator)  
- Classical planners (FastDownward with learned heuristics)  

**Metrics**:  
1. **Zero-Shot Success Rate**: Task completion in unseen domains.  
2. **Adaptation Efficiency**: Few-shot learning performance (success rate vs. samples).  
3. **Plan Feasibility**: Percentage of verified plans executed without repair.  
4. **Computational Overhead**: Planning and verification time vs. baselines.  

**Training Protocol**:  
- **Sub-Policies**: Meta-trained on 50+ procedurally generated environments (navigation, manipulation).  
- **Symbolic Planner**: Initialized with domain-specific PDDL schemas, refined via bi-level optimization.  
- **Repair Module**: LLM fine-tuned on planning-domain corpora (e.g., ASNet datasets).

### 3. Expected Outcomes  

1. **Improved Zero-Shot Generalization**: The framework will achieve $\geq 15\%$ higher success rates in unseen ProcTHOR configurations compared to neuro-symbolic baselines, validated via paired t-tests ($p < 0.05$).  
2. **Sample Efficiency**: Require $\leq 10$ environmental interactions for policy adaptation in new domains, outperforming MAML-based RL.  
3. **Formal Guarantees**: Demonstrate $\geq 90\%$ plan feasibility post-verification, with LLM repair reducing constraint violations by 50%.  
4. **Theoretical Contributions**: Prove bounds on the bi-level optimization gap and contrastive meta-learning’s disentanglement efficacy under Lipschitz continuity assumptions.  

**Impact**  
This work will provide a unified framework for combining symbolic reasoning with adaptive RL, directly addressing the workshop’s focus on generalization in SDM. By enabling cross-domain policy transfer with formal safety guarantees, it will accelerate deployment of AI systems in real-world robotics and autonomous agents. The open-sourced implementation and benchmarks will foster collaboration between planning and RL communities, advancing the frontier of generalizable AI.
