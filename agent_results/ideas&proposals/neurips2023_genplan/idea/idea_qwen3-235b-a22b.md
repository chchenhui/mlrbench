1. Title:  
**Meta-Neuro-Symbolic Learning for Hierarchical Transfer in Sequential Decision-Making**  

2. Motivation:  
Current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) excels at short-horizon tasks but struggles with sample inefficiency, poor generalization, and limited transferability. Conversely, symbolic planning methods offer strong long-horizon generalization but lack adaptability to complex, high-dimensional environments. Bridging these approaches is critical to building systems that can learn reusable skills and adapt rapidly to unseen tasks in real-world scenarios like robotics or autonomous planning, where efficiency and transferability are paramount.  

3. Main Idea:  
We propose a hierarchical framework combining **neuro-symbolic planning** and **meta-learning** to solve sequential decision-making (SDM) problems with cross-domain transferability. At the high level, a symbolic planner discovers abstract, composable subtasks (e.g., via program induction or hierarchical task networks) using domain-agnostic knowledge. At the low level, a meta-learned neural policy adapts these subtasks to new tasks by learning task-agnostic representations and rapid fine-tuning mechanisms. Specifically, meta-learning trains the policy to generalize from a few examples using diverse training tasks, while the symbolic hierarchy provides structured priors (e.g., heuristics, abstract actions) to reduce the search space. Expected outcomes include improved sample efficiency, few-shot adaptation to novel SDM problems, and transfer of subtask policies across domains (e.g., from navigation to robotic manipulation). This integration bridges the analytical rigor of AI planning with the flexibility of DRL, enabling systems that learn hierarchical, actionable knowledge for robust long-horizon planning and rapid real-world deployment.
