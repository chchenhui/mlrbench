# Meta-CRAFT: Meta-learning for Compositional Reasoning in Few-shot Sequential Decision Making

## Motivation
Sequential decision-making (SDM) systems often struggle with generalizing from limited examples, requiring extensive training for each new task. Humans, in contrast, quickly decompose novel problems into familiar subproblems and compose existing skills into solutions. Current approaches in reinforcement learning suffer from poor sample efficiency when transferring to new domains, while planning approaches lack adaptability to short-horizon control. We need methods that efficiently generalize across tasks using compositional reasoning with minimal examples.

## Main Idea
Meta-CRAFT leverages meta-learning to explicitly develop compositional reasoning for few-shot adaptation in SDM. The approach trains a meta-policy over a distribution of related tasks, learning not just how to solve specific problems but how to decompose unfamiliar problems into familiar components. The architecture consists of (1) a skill encoder that identifies reusable sub-skills from limited demonstrations, (2) a compositional reasoning module that sequences these skills for new problems, and (3) a meta-adaptation component that rapidly fine-tunes the composition strategy with few examples. By framing meta-learning as learning compositional structures rather than just parameter initialization, Meta-CRAFT can generalize to structurally similar but superficially different tasks using only 3-5 examples. This builds a bridge between the sample efficiency of planning approaches and the adaptability of reinforcement learning methods, with applications ranging from robot manipulation to automated software testing.
