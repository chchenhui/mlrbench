# Neuro-Symbolic Hierarchical Planning with Meta-Learned Sub-Policies for Cross-Domain Generalization  

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Background  
Humans exhibit remarkable capabilities in sequential decision-making (SDM), solving long-horizon tasks through generalization from sparse experiences and transferring learned skills to novel environments. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, however, face persistent challenges in reconciling the strengths of data-driven reinforcement learning (RL) with formal symbolic planning. Deep RL methods excel in short-horizon, high-dimensional control but suffer from sample inefficiency and poor cross-task generalization. Conversely, symbolic planning approaches achieve strong generalization via structured representations (e.g., PDDL schemas) but struggle with low-level control and perceptual complexity. This gap limits real-world deployment, particularly in robotics, where agents must adapt to unseen tasks with minimal retraining.  

Recent advancements in neuro-symbolic AI—integrating neural perception with symbolic reasoning—offer a promising bridge. For instance, works like NeSyC (2025) combine LLMs with symbolic planners for continual knowledge acquisition, while VisualPredicator (2024) introduces neuro-symbolic predicates to abstract sensorimotor complexities. These methods highlight the potential of hybrid architectures but leave critical challenges unmet: (1) aligning hierarchical symbolic action schemas with trainable sub-policies, (2) ensuring formal guarantees of plan validity in dynamic environments, and (3) achieving robust zero-shot generalization across domains.  

### 1.2 Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies hierarchical planning and meta-trained sub-policies. Key objectives include:  
1. **Bi-Level Optimization**: Jointly learn symbolic action schemas and meta-reinforcement learned sub-policies to maximize cross-domain transferability.  
2. **Contrastive Meta-Learning**: Disentangle task-invariant and task-specific policy components for few-shot adaptation.  
3. **Formal Verification**: Validate symbolic plans and refine neural executions using LLM-guided repairing.  
4. **Scalable Evaluation**: Benchmark performance in complex 3D environments (e.g., ProcTHOR) and robotic control tasks.  

### 1.3 Significance  
This work addresses two open problems in AI:  
- **Generalization in SDM**: By grounding abstract PDDL-like schemas in meta-learned neural policies, the framework enables agents to transfer high-level strategies across novel tasks with minimal adaptation.  
- **Safe and Efficient Transfer**: Combining formal verification (e.g., SMT solvers) with adaptive sub-policies ensures constraint satisfaction while preserving sample efficiency.  

Successful implementation will bridge the RL-planning divide, enabling practical applications like household robots that adapt to unseen chores or autonomous systems for logistics tasks.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Neuro-Symbolic Architecture Overview  
The framework comprises three layers (Figure 1):  
1. **Symbolic Planner**: Constructs abstract hierarchical task networks (HTNs) using domain-specific PDDL schemas.  
2. **Meta-Learned Sub-Policies**: Neural networks conditioned on task descriptors (e.g., initial states, goals) to execute low-level actions.  
3. **Verification-Refinement Module**: Ensures plan validity and repairs defects via LLM-guided logic.

### 2.2 Data Collection & Environment  
**Training Environments**:  
- **ProcTHOR**: Photorealistic 3D environments with customizable rooms and objects.  
- **Meta-World**: Multi-task robotic manipulation suite with varied task structures.  
- **Custom Compositional Tasks**: Blocks-world variants requiring combinatorial reasoning.  

**Data Structure**: Each environment yields tuples $(s_t, a_t, g_t, r_t)$, where $s_t$ is the state, $a_t$ the action, $g_t$ the goal, and $r_t$ the reward. Goals $g_t$ are parameterized symbolic expressions (e.g., $\texttt{Place}(obj, loc)$).  

### 2.3 Algorithmic Design  

#### 2.3.1 Symbolic Planner  
The planner generates HTNs by reasoning over task-specific logical propositions. Given a high-level goal $G$, it decomposes $G$ into primitive actions $\mathcal{A}^{\text{symb}} = \{a_1, \dots, a_K\}$ using PDDL schemas. For example, $\texttt{Navigate}(agent, target)$ expands to $\texttt{MoveToFront}(agent, door) \land \texttt{Open}(door)$.  

#### 2.3.2 Meta-Learned Sub-Policies  
Each symbolic action $a_k \in \mathcal{A}^{\text{symb}}$ maps to a neural sub-policy $\pi_k^\theta: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \Delta(\mathcal{A})$, where $\theta$ are parameters optimized via meta-RL. The policy is trained to maximize expected return across diverse base tasks $\mathcal{T}_{\text{base}}$:  
$$
\theta^* = \arg\max_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \mathcal{T}_{\text{base}}} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t r(s_t, a_t) \right],
$$  
where $\gamma$ is the discount factor. To enable few-shot adaptation to new tasks $\mathcal{T}_{\text{new}}$, we adopt the **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)** framework. For a few demonstrations $\mathcal{D}_{\text{new}} = \{(\hat{s}, \hat{g})\}$, the sub-policy adapts:  
$$
\theta_{\text{new}} = \theta^* - \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_{\text{new}}(\theta^*),
$$  
where $\alpha$ is the meta-step size and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{new}}$ measures expected task-specific loss.  

#### 2.3.3 Contrastive Meta-Learning  
To disentangle task-invariant and task-specific policy components, we pretrain a base policy $\pi_{\text{base}}$ using contrastive loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}} = -\log \frac{\exp(h_{\text{inv}}(s, g) \cdot h_{\text{spec}}(s, g))}{\sum_{g' \in \mathcal{G}_{\text{neg}}} \exp(h_{\text{inv}}(s, g) \cdot h_{\text{spec}}(s, g'))},
$$  
where $h_{\text{inv}}$ and $h_{\text{spec}}$ are invariant/specific encoders. Negative goals $\mathcal{G}_{\text{neg}}$ are sampled from unrelated tasks.  

### 2.4 Alignment via Bi-Level Optimization  
The symbolic planner and neural sub-policies are aligned through two objectives:  
1. **Policy-Grounded Abstraction**: Symbolic schemas are optimized to match sub-policy capabilities:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{schema}} = \mathbb{E}_{g \sim \mathcal{G}} \left[ D_{\text{KL}} \left( \pi_{\text{plan}}(a|g) \parallel \pi_{\text{sub}}(a|g) \right) \right],
$$  
where $\pi_{\text{plan}}$ is the symbolic plan distribution and $\pi_{\text{sub}}$ the sub-policy.  
2. **Refinement Loss**: The LLM-guided refiner suggests plan modifications when executions violate constraints. The loss penalizes invalid substitutions:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{repair}} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left\| z_t^{\text{LLM}} - \texttt{BERT}_{\phi}(a_t) \right\|^2,
$$  
where $z_t^{\text{LLM}}$ is the LLM’s refined action embedding and $\texttt{BERT}_{\phi}$ encodes executed actions.  

### 2.5 Experimental Design  

#### 2.5.1 Baselines  
- **Seq2Seq-RL**: End-to-end transformer policy.  
- **HTN-PDDL**: Pure symbolic planner.  
- **Meta-World**: RL-based hierarchical method.  
- **NeSIG** (2023): Neuro-symbolic planner without meta-learning.  

#### 2.5.2 Evaluation Metrics  
1. **Zero-Shot Success Rate (ZSSR)**: Fraction of novel tasks solved without fine-tuning.  
2. **Sample Efficiency**: Number of demonstrations required to adapt to new tasks.  
3. **Plan Validity ($\phi_{\text{valid}}$)**: Ratio of feasible action sequences.  
4. **Execution Efficiency (EE)**: Normalized task completion time.  

#### 2.5.3 Dataset & Implementation Details  
- **ProcTHOR**: Rendered RGB-D scenes with 200 objects across 10 room types.  
- **Meta-World**: 50 diverse robotic control tasks.  
- **Training**: Use PyTorch + PDDL4J. Sub-policy meta-training uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
