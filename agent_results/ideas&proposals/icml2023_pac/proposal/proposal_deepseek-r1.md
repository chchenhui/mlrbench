**Research Proposal: PAC-Bayesian Policy Optimization with Uncertainty-Aware Exploration for Reinforcement Learning**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms face a critical challenge: balancing exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional, stochastic environments. While deep RL methods like Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have achieved empirical success, their exploration strategies (e.g., ε-greedy or entropy regularization) lack theoretical guarantees of sample efficiency. This limitation is particularly acute in costly interactive settings, such as robotics or healthcare, where unguided exploration can lead to unsafe or inefficient learning.  

PAC-Bayesian theory provides a framework to derive generalization bounds for probabilistic learning algorithms by quantifying the trade-off between empirical performance and model complexity. Recent work has demonstrated its applicability to deep learning and RL, such as PAC-Bayesian Actor-Critic (PBAC) algorithms that bound Bellman approximation errors. However, existing methods do not fully leverage PAC-Bayes to *directly optimize exploration strategies* or handle nonstationary environments. Bridging this gap could yield RL algorithms with provable sample efficiency and robustness.  

**Research Objectives**  
This work aims to:  
1. Develop a **PAC-Bayesian policy optimization framework** that minimizes a tractable PAC-Bayes bound over policy distributions.  
2. Integrate **uncertainty-aware exploration** by prioritizing states with high posterior variance.  
3. Derive **time-uniform PAC-Bayes bounds** to handle distribution shifts in nonstationary environments.  
4. Validate the framework empirically on benchmark tasks (e.g., Atari, MuJoCo) against state-of-the-art baselines.  

**Significance**  
By unifying PAC-Bayesian theory with deep RL, this research will:  
- Provide **theoretical guarantees** for sample efficiency and generalization in interactive learning.  
- Enable **systematic exploration** guided by policy uncertainty, reducing wasteful data collection.  
- Advance the application of RL in safety-critical domains (e.g., robotics, autonomous systems) through robust, uncertainty-aware policies.

### 2. **Methodology**  

**Research Design**  
The proposed framework, **PAC-Bayesian Policy Optimization (PBPO)**, combines variational inference with PAC-Bayes theory to optimize a distribution over policies. Key components include:  

#### **A. PAC-Bayesian Policy Distribution**  
- **Variational Posterior**: Represent the policy as a deep neural network with parameters $\theta \sim Q$, where $Q$ is a variational posterior distribution.  
- **PAC-Bayes Bound**: Minimize the PAC-Bayesian generalization bound, which for a loss function $\mathcal{L}$ and prior $P$, is given by:  
  $$
  \mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim Q}[\mathcal{L}(\theta)] \leq \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim Q}[\hat{\mathcal{L}}_n(\theta)]}_{\text{Empirical Risk}} + \sqrt{\frac{\text{KL}(Q \| P) + \log\frac{n}{\delta}}{2n}},
  $$  
  where $\hat{\mathcal{L}}_n$ is the empirical risk on $n$ samples, and $\delta$ is the confidence parameter.  

#### **B. Uncertainty-Aware Exploration**  
- **Posterior Variance as Exploration Bonus**: Augment the reward function with an exploration term proportional to the posterior variance over policy parameters:  
  $$
  r_{\text{aug}}(s, a) = r(s, a) + \lambda \cdot \text{Var}_{\theta \sim Q}(Q_\theta(a|s)),
  $$  
  where $\lambda$ balances exploration and exploitation.  
- **Adaptive $\lambda$**: Adjust $\lambda$ dynamically using the PAC-Bayes bound to ensure theoretical guarantees on exploration efficiency.  

#### **C. Handling Nonstationarity**  
- **Time-Uniform Bounds**: Leverage the unified PAC-Bayes framework of Chugg et al. (2023) to derive bounds valid across all training steps. For a sequence of losses $\{\mathcal{L}_t\}_{t=1}^T$, the bound becomes:  
  $$
  \mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim Q}[\mathcal{L}_t(\theta)] \leq \mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim Q}[\hat{\mathcal{L}}_t(\theta)] + \sqrt{\frac{\text{KL}(Q \| P) + \log\frac{t^2}{\delta}}{2t}} \quad \forall t \leq T.
  $$  

#### **D. Algorithmic Implementation**  
1. **Variational Inference**: Train a Bayesian neural network policy using stochastic gradient variational inference (SGVI) to approximate $Q$.  
2. **Policy Optimization**: Minimize the PAC-Bayes bound via gradient descent, integrating the exploration bonus into the actor-critic loss:  
   - *Critic Loss*: PAC-Bayesian TD error with uncertainty penalization.  
   - *Actor Loss*: Policy gradient with entropy regularization and variance-based exploration.  
3. **Nonstationary Adaptation**: Periodically update the prior $P$ using a sliding window of recent transitions to account for distribution shifts.  

#### **E. Experimental Validation**  
- **Benchmarks**: Atari 2600, MuJoCo locomotion tasks, and a nonstationary variant of Procgen.  
- **Baselines**: Compare against SAC, PPO, and PBAC.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - *Sample Efficiency*: Learning curves vs. interaction steps.  
  - *Final Performance*: Average return over 100 episodes.  
  - *Uncertainty Calibration*: Correlation between posterior variance and prediction error.  
  - *Generalization*: Performance on unseen environments.
