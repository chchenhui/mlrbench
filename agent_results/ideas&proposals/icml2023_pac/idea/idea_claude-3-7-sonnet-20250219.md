# PAC-Bayesian Bounds for Robust Exploration in Non-Stationary Bandits

## Motivation
In real-world interactive learning scenarios, environments are rarely static. Recommendation systems, clinical trials, and autonomous systems operate in dynamic settings where reward distributions shift over time. Traditional bandit algorithms struggle with these non-stationary environments, often requiring environment-specific knowledge or manual tuning. PAC-Bayesian theory offers a promising framework to analyze and develop adaptive algorithms with theoretical guarantees in such challenging settings, potentially leading to more robust and sample-efficient exploration strategies.

## Main Idea
This research proposes a PAC-Bayesian framework for multi-armed bandits under non-stationary conditions with bounded distribution shifts. We introduce a novel posterior update mechanism that incorporates both recent observations and uncertainty about the rate of distribution change. The approach dynamically adjusts exploration rates based on detected distribution shifts, striking a balance between leveraging past knowledge and adapting to new conditions. Our method maintains a time-dependent prior that evolves based on the estimated non-stationarity, enabling theoretical PAC-Bayesian guarantees that adapt to the actual (unknown) degree of non-stationarity. We develop practical algorithms with these guarantees and demonstrate their effectiveness in domains with varying degrees of distribution shift, showing improved regret bounds compared to existing methods that lack principled adaptation mechanisms.
