**Title:** PAC-Bayesian Policy Optimization with Uncertainty-Aware Exploration for Reinforcement Learning  

**Motivation:** Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with sample inefficiency due to unguided exploration strategies (e.g., ε-greedy) lacking theoretical guarantees. PAC-Bayes theory provides generalization bounds that could systematically quantify policy uncertainty, enabling data-efficient exploration. Bridging this gap could yield RL algorithms with robustness and provable sample efficiency.  

**Main Idea:** This work proposes a PAC-Bayesian framework for RL that optimizes a distribution over policies while explicitly minimizing a PAC-Bayes bound. By approximating a variational posterior over deep neural network policies, the bound is reformulated as a tractable objective integrating policy performance and uncertainty. During training, exploration is guided by states where the posterior variance is high, prioritizing uncertain regions. The bound’s minimization automatically balances exploration-exploitation, while distribution shifts are handled via bounds adapted to non-stationary transitions. Expected outcomes include a practical deep RL algorithm with tighter sample complexity guarantees and improved empirical performance on benchmarks like Atari, compared to SAC or PPO. Impact: Enables sample-efficient RL in costly interactive settings (e.g., robotics) with theoretical safety nets.
