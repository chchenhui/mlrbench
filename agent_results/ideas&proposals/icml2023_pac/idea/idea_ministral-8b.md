### Title: PAC-Bayesian Analysis for Sample-Efficient Interactive Learning

### Motivation:
The increasing complexity of real-world data and the need for efficient learning algorithms have led to the rise of interactive learning methods. However, the high cost of acquiring observations in an interactive fashion presents a significant challenge. PAC-Bayesian theory, with its robust theoretical foundations, provides a promising framework for analyzing and improving the sample efficiency of interactive learning algorithms. This research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical implementation, ensuring that interactive learning algorithms can achieve optimal performance with minimal data requirements.

### Main Idea:
This research proposes a novel approach that combines PAC-Bayesian theory with deep interactive learning methods to develop sample-efficient algorithms. The key idea is to leverage the probabilistic nature of PAC-Bayesian bounds to analyze and optimize the exploration-exploitation trade-offs in interactive learning settings. The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Theoretical Analysis**: Develop PAC-Bayesian bounds for interactive learning scenarios, considering both distribution shifts and adversarial corruptions.
2. **Algorithm Design**: Design deep neural network-based interactive learning algorithms that incorporate PAC-Bayesian principles to guide exploration and exploitation.
3. **Empirical Evaluation**: Conduct extensive experiments to validate the sample efficiency of the proposed algorithms in various interactive learning tasks, including online learning, continual learning, and reinforcement learning.

The expected outcomes include:
- **Theoretical Insights**: Clear understanding of how PAC-Bayesian theory can be applied to analyze and improve the sample efficiency of interactive learning algorithms.
- **Practical Algorithms**: Development of sample-efficient interactive learning algorithms that can be easily implemented and applied to real-world scenarios.
- **Empirical Validation**: Demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.

The potential impact of this research is significant, as it can lead to more efficient and effective interactive learning algorithms, reducing the cost and time required for data acquisition and learning. Furthermore, the theoretical insights gained can contribute to the broader field of PAC-Bayesian theory and its applications in machine learning.
