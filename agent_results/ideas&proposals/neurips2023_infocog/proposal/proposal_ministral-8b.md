### Title: Information Bottleneck for Efficient Human-AI Communication in Cooperative Tasks

### Introduction

Effective human-AI collaboration is crucial for achieving high performance in various tasks, ranging from simple decision-making processes to complex cooperative endeavors. However, current AI agents often struggle with communicating effectively with humans, either by providing too much irrelevant information or by compressing information to the point of miscommunication. This research aims to address these challenges by leveraging the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle to optimize the trade-off between communicative expressiveness and complexity in human-AI interactions.

The Information Bottleneck principle, introduced by Tishby et al. (2000), provides a framework for compressing information while retaining its essential components. This principle has been successfully applied in various domains, including machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science. By applying the IB principle to human-AI communication, we can develop AI agents that learn to communicate concisely yet informatively, enhancing both task performance and user experience.

This proposal outlines a research plan to develop and validate an IB-based approach for training AI agents in cooperative tasks involving communication with humans. The proposed method will be evaluated using a combination of simulation and real-world experiments, with a focus on assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the communication strategies learned by the agents.

### Methodology

#### Research Design

The proposed research will follow a multi-stage approach, combining theoretical analysis, algorithm development, and empirical validation. The stages include:

1. **Theoretical Framework Development**: Establish the theoretical foundation for applying the IB principle to human-AI communication.
2. **Algorithm Development**: Design and implement deep variational IB methods within a reinforcement learning (RL) loop.
3. **Experimental Validation**: Evaluate the performance of the proposed method using simulation and real-world experiments.
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Refine the algorithm based on experimental results and feedback from human participants.

#### Data Collection

For the experimental validation, we will collect data from cooperative tasks involving human participants and AI agents. The tasks will be designed to cover a range of complexity and require effective communication between the human and AI. The data will include:

- **Task Data**: Information about the cooperative tasks, including task-specific goals, rules, and constraints.
- **Communication Data**: Records of communication exchanges between the human and AI, including the content of the messages and the timing of the messages.
- **Performance Data**: Measurements of task performance, such as success rates, completion times, and user satisfaction scores.

#### Algorithmic Steps

The core of the proposed method is the application of the IB principle within a deep variational framework. The following steps outline the algorithmic process:

1. **State Representation**: The agent's internal state, representing its understanding of the task and environment, is encoded as the source variable $X$.
2. **Communication Signal**: The communication signal sent to the human is the compressed representation of the agent's state, denoted as $Y = f(X, Z)$, where $Z$ is a latent variable representing the compression process.
3. **Objective Function**: The objective function aims to maximize mutual information between the signal $Y$ and the task-relevant aspects of the agent's state $R$, while minimizing the mutual information between $Y$ and the full internal state $X$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:
   $$
   \text{Maximize} \quad I(Y; R) - \beta I(Y; X)
   $$
   where $\beta$ is a regularization parameter controlling the trade-off between expressiveness and complexity.

4. **Deep Variational Information Bottleneck (DVIB)**: The DVIB method is used to learn the mapping $f$ from $X$ to $Y$. This involves training a variational autoencoder (VAE) with an additional constraint to enforce the IB objective. The VAE consists of an encoder network $q_\phi(z|x)$ and a decoder network $p_\theta(y|z)$, where $z$ is the latent variable. The objective function for the VAE is:
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{VAE} = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(y|z)] + \text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p(z))
   $$
   The IB constraint is added to this objective to enforce the desired communication strategy:
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{IB} = I(Y; R) - \beta I(Y; X)
   $$
   The total loss function is:
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{VAE} + \mathcal{L}_{IB}
   $$

5. **Reinforcement Learning Loop**: The DVIB method is integrated into an RL loop, where the agent learns to select actions based on the communication signal $Y$. The RL algorithm, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), optimizes the policy $\pi_\theta(a|s, y)$ to maximize the expected return $R(s, a, y)$. The state $s$ includes the agent's internal state $X$ and the communication signal $Y$.

#### Experimental Design

The experimental design will involve two phases: simulation and real-world experiments.

1. **Simulation Phase**: Simulate cooperative tasks using a set of predefined scenarios and human-like agents. The simulation will allow us to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in a controlled environment before testing it with real human participants.

2. **Real-World Experiments**: Conduct experiments with human participants in cooperative tasks. The experiments will be designed to collect data on task performance, communication efficiency, and user satisfaction. The human participants will interact with AI agents trained using the proposed DVIB method.

#### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the proposed method will be evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Task Performance**: Success rates, completion times, and other task-specific metrics.
- **Communication Efficiency**: The amount of information transmitted, the complexity of the communication signals, and the effectiveness of the information conveyed.
- **User Satisfaction**: Surveys and interviews to assess the users' satisfaction with the communication strategies used by the AI agents.
- **Generalization**: The ability of the trained agents to adapt to new tasks and environments.

### Expected Outcomes & Impact

The expected outcomes of this research include:

1. **Development of an IB-based Communication Framework**: A novel method for training AI agents to communicate effectively with humans, leveraging the IB principle to optimize the trade-off between informativeness and complexity.
2. **Improved Task Performance**: Enhanced performance in cooperative tasks, as measured by success rates, completion times, and other task-specific metrics.
