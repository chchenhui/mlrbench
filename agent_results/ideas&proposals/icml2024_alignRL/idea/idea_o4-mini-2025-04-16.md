Title: Structural Complexity Profiling: A Framework for Bridging RL Theory and Practice

Motivation:  
The gap between worst-case theoretical guarantees and empirically tuned RL methods stems from a lack of common language around the structural features of real tasks. Quantifying these features can guide both theorists and experimentalists toward algorithms that are provably effective under practical conditions, rather than tailored to contrived worst-case scenarios.

Main Idea:  
We introduce an open-source toolkit that empirically measures key complexity metrics—Bellman rank, exploration dimension, reward sparsity, and function-approximation smoothness—across standard and real-world RL environments. Tasks are then clustered into complexity classes, yielding a “complexity signature” for each environment. This signature drives two feedback loops: (1) an algorithm‐selection module that matches environments to RL methods with the tightest known guarantees for their class, improving sample efficiency and robustness; (2) a theoretical analysis pipeline that prioritizes tightening bounds for the most prevalent or poorly understood complexity classes. We will validate the approach by demonstrating statistically significant gains in learning speed and stability on a benchmark suite, thereby fostering a shared foundation for theory-practice collaboration.
