1. **Title**: Bridging RL Theory and Practice with the Effective Horizon (arXiv:2304.09853)
   - **Authors**: Cassidy Laidlaw, Stuart Russell, Anca Dragan
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces the "effective horizon," a complexity measure that correlates with the empirical performance of deep RL algorithms. By analyzing 155 deterministic MDPs, the authors demonstrate that the effective horizon can predict when deep RL succeeds or fails, offering a bridge between theoretical bounds and practical outcomes.

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Lack of Theoretical Justification for Heuristics**: Many RL heuristics are developed based on empirical success without formal theoretical backing, leading to challenges in understanding their generalizability and reliability.

2. **Sample Efficiency**: Heuristic-based methods often require extensive sampling to achieve significant improvements, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.

3. **Bias Introduction**: Certain heuristics, such as non-potential-based reward shaping, can introduce biases that negatively affect the performance and convergence of RL algorithms.

4. **Generalization to Novel Tasks**: Heuristic-driven approaches may perform well on specific tasks but struggle to generalize to new, unseen environments due to their task-specific design.

5. **Bridging Theory and Practice**: There exists a significant gap between theoretical RL research and practical applications, making it challenging to develop algorithms that are both theoretically sound and empirically effective.
