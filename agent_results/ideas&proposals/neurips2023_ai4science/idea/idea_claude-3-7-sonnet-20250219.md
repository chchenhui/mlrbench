# Physics-Informed Neural Network Ensembles for Robust Dynamical System Modeling

## Motivation
Modeling complex dynamical systems accurately at scale remains challenging due to computational constraints, sparse observations, and chaotic behaviors. Traditional physics simulations struggle with millions of particles, while pure data-driven approaches often produce physically implausible results. This research addresses the critical gap between computationally expensive physics-based models and data-hungry machine learning approaches by developing a hybrid framework that maintains physical consistency while scaling to large systems.

## Main Idea
We propose Physics-Informed Neural Network Ensembles (PINNEs) that combine multiple specialized neural networks, each handling different aspects of dynamical systems physics. The approach employs a hierarchical structure where: (1) Base networks learn fundamental conservation laws (momentum, energy) as hard constraints; (2) Specialized networks focus on specific interaction patterns between particles; and (3) A meta-network orchestrates when to activate each specialized network. By designing differentiable physics modules that encode domain knowledge as inductive biases, our approach requires significantly less training data while ensuring physical consistency. The ensembling strategy also provides uncertainty quantification, crucial for scientific applications. We'll implement adaptive resolution techniques where computationally intensive regions receive higher-fidelity treatment, enabling scaling to millions of particles. Applications include molecular dynamics, fluid simulations, and plasma physics, with potential to accelerate scientific discovery across disciplines by orders of magnitude.
