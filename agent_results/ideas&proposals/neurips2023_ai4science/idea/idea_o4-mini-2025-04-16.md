Title: Symplectic Graph Neural Operators for Scalable Particle Dynamics

Motivation:  
Modeling millions of interacting particles underpins discoveries in materials science, plasma physics, and molecular biology but remains computationally prohibitive with traditional solvers. Embedding physical structure directly into AI-driven models can deliver both speed and long-term stability.

Main Idea:  
We propose a Graph Neural Operator (GNO) augmented with symplectic integrators to respect energy and momentum conservation in large-scale particle simulations. Particles become graph nodes; edges encode interaction kernels (e.g., Lennard-Jones, Coulomb). The GNO learns a continuous update operator trained on small-to-medium scale trajectory datasets via a physics-informed loss (Hamiltonian residual and symplectic form preservation). At inference, the learned operator generalizes to millions of particles by kernel factorization and localized message passing. We incorporate adaptive time stepping driven by learned uncertainty estimates to maintain accuracy under varying densities. Expected outcomes include 10–100× speedup over classical MD while preserving bounded energy drift over billions of steps. This framework can transform large-scale molecular dynamics, accelerate materials design, and pave the way for AI-powered simulations in quantum and cosmological contexts.
