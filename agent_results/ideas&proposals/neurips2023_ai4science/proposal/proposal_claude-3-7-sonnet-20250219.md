# Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for De Novo Molecular Generation with Dynamic Stability Validation

## Introduction

Drug discovery is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, with high attrition rates occurring throughout the pipeline. Traditional approaches to de novo molecular design have been revolutionized by artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, enabling researchers to explore vast chemical spaces more efficiently. However, despite significant advancements in computational methods for molecular generation, a critical gap persists between the creation of chemically valid molecules and those that exhibit physical stability and favorable dynamic properties in biological environments.

Current state-of-the-art approaches in AI-driven molecular generation primarily focus on chemical validity, synthetic accessibility, and static property prediction. Models such as those presented by Park et al. (2024) with Mol-AIR and Xu et al. (2023) with Transformer-based reinforcement learning have demonstrated remarkable abilities to generate novel molecules with desired chemical properties. However, these approaches often neglect crucial physical aspects of molecular behavior, including conformational stability, binding dynamics, and free energy landscapes. As a result, many computationally designed molecules fail in later experimental stages due to poor physical properties that were not adequately considered during the generative process.

The fundamental issue lies in the disconnection between chemical graph generation and physical simulation in the molecule design workflow. While various reinforcement learning frameworks for de novo drug design have been proposed, as demonstrated by Gummesson Svensson et al. (2023) and Hu et al. (2023), these approaches typically evaluate candidate molecules using simplified scoring functions that cannot capture complex physical behaviors. This limitation results in a high proportion of false positives—molecules that appear promising based on static chemical descriptors but exhibit unfavorable physical properties when subjected to more rigorous testing.

Recent research has begun to address this gap by incorporating physics-informed approaches into molecular modeling. Work on physics-informed neural networks for molecular dynamics simulations (2024) and reinforcement learning guided by quantum mechanics (2023) represents initial steps toward integrating physical constraints into the generative process. However, these approaches have not yet fully bridged the divide between efficient molecular generation and comprehensive physical validation.

This research aims to develop a novel physics-informed reinforcement learning framework for de novo molecular generation that incorporates real-time physical validation through molecular dynamics simulations. By creating a closed-loop system where a generative model interacts directly with physics-based simulations, we seek to produce molecules that are not only chemically valid but also physically stable and functionally effective in biological contexts. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly reduce the attrition rate in drug discovery by filtering out physically implausible candidates early in the design process, thereby accelerating the identification of viable lead compounds.

The significance of this research extends beyond immediate applications in drug discovery. By establishing a methodology that integrates physical principles into AI-driven generative models, we contribute to the broader objective of developing scientifically grounded AI systems that respect fundamental physical laws. This approach aligns with the emerging field of science-informed AI, where machine learning methods are enhanced by incorporating domain-specific scientific knowledge, leading to more reliable and interpretable models.

## Methodology

Our research methodology integrates reinforcement learning with molecular dynamics simulations to create a physics-informed framework for de novo molecular generation. The approach consists of several interconnected components, described in detail below.

### 1. System Architecture

The proposed system comprises four main components:

1. **Molecular Generator**: A graph-based generative neural network that produces candidate molecular structures.
2. **Physical Validator**: A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation environment that evaluates the physical properties of generated molecules.
3. **Surrogate Model**: A lightweight neural network that approximates MD simulations for rapid feedback.
4. **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: A policy network that learns to generate molecules with optimal chemical and physical properties.

Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of the proposed system.

### 2. Molecular Generator

We will implement a graph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) as our molecular generator. The generator will be structured as follows:

1. **Encoder**: A graph neural network (GNN) that encodes molecular graphs into a latent representation.
2. **Decoder**: A graph construction network that reconstructs molecular graphs from latent representations.

The molecular generator will be formalized as:

$$G_\theta(z) \rightarrow M$$

where $G_\theta$ represents the generator with parameters $\theta$, $z$ is a latent vector, and $M$ is the generated molecular graph.

For encoding molecular graphs, we will use a message-passing neural network (MPNN) defined as:

$$h_v^{(t+1)} = \text{UPDATE}\left(h_v^{(t)}, \text{AGGREGATE}\left(\{h_u^{(t)} : u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\}\right)\right)$$

where $h_v^{(t)}$ is the feature vector of node $v$ at iteration $t$, $\mathcal{N}(v)$ is the set of neighboring nodes of $v$, and AGGREGATE and UPDATE are learnable functions.

### 3. Physical Validator

The physical validator will employ molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the physical properties of generated molecules. We will use OpenMM as the MD simulation engine, with the following setup:

1. **Force Field**: AMBER ff14SB for proteins and GAFF2 for small molecules.
2. **Simulation Parameters**:
   - Temperature: 310K (physiological)
   - Pressure: 1 atm
   - Time step: 2 fs
   - Simulation length: 10 ns (for full validation), 100 ps (for quick screening)

For each generated molecule, the physical validator will compute the following metrics:

1. **Conformational Stability**: Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions over the simulation trajectory.
2. **Binding Affinity**: Free energy of binding (ΔG) to a target protein using MM-GBSA calculations.
3. **Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA)**: To assess hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties.

These metrics will be formalized as:

$$\text{RMSD}(t) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N ||\mathbf{r}_i(t) - \mathbf{r}_i(0)||^2}$$

$$\Delta G_{\text{bind}} = G_{\text{complex}} - (G_{\text{protein}} + G_{\text{ligand}})$$

where $\mathbf{r}_i(t)$ represents the position of atom $i$ at time $t$, and $G$ represents the free energy.

### 4. Surrogate Model

To address the computational intensity of MD simulations, we will develop a surrogate model that approximates physical validation metrics. This model will be structured as:

$$S_\phi(M) \rightarrow (\hat{\text{RMSD}}, \hat{\Delta G}_{\text{bind}}, \hat{\text{SASA}})$$

where $S_\phi$ is the surrogate model with parameters $\phi$, and $\hat{\text{RMSD}}$, $\hat{\Delta G}_{\text{bind}}$, and $\hat{\text{SASA}}$ are the predicted physical properties.

The surrogate model will be trained using supervised learning on data generated from actual MD simulations. We will use a combination of graph neural networks and attention mechanisms:

$$h_M = \text{GNN}(M)$$
$$\hat{p} = \text{MLP}(h_M)$$

where $h_M$ is the graph-level representation of molecule $M$, and $\hat{p}$ represents the predicted physical properties.

To ensure the surrogate model's accuracy, we will implement an active learning strategy:

1. Initialize the surrogate model with a small set of MD simulation data.
2. Use the model to predict properties for new molecules.
3. Select molecules with high prediction uncertainty for full MD simulation.
4. Update the surrogate model with new simulation data.

### 5. Reinforcement Learning Framework

We will implement a policy gradient reinforcement learning framework where the molecular generator acts as the policy network. The RL framework will be formalized as:

1. **State**: The current molecular graph $M_t$ at step $t$.
2. **Action**: Modification to the molecular graph (add atom, add bond, remove atom, remove bond).
3. **Reward**: A composite function of chemical and physical properties.

The reward function $R(M)$ will be defined as:

$$R(M) = w_c \cdot R_{\text{chem}}(M) + w_p \cdot R_{\text{phys}}(M)$$

where:
- $R_{\text{chem}}(M)$ represents chemical property rewards (e.g., QED, SA score, synthetic accessibility)
- $R_{\text{phys}}(M)$ represents physical property rewards from the validator
- $w_c$ and $w_p$ are adaptive weights that balance chemical and physical considerations

The physical property reward component will be calculated as:

$$R_{\text{phys}}(M) = \alpha \cdot f_{\text{RMSD}}(M) + \beta \cdot f_{\Delta G}(M) + \gamma \cdot f_{\text{SASA}}(M)$$

where $f_{\text{RMSD}}$, $f_{\Delta G}$, and $f_{\text{SASA}}$ are normalized functions of the respective physical properties, and $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are weighting coefficients.

The policy network will be trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, with the objective function:

$$L(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t \left[ \min(r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t) \right]$$

where $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t|s_t)}$ is the probability ratio between the new and old policies, $\hat{A}_t$ is the estimated advantage at time $t$, and $\epsilon$ is a hyperparameter.

### 6. Adaptive Reward Balancing

To effectively navigate the trade-off between chemical validity and physical plausibility, we will implement an adaptive reward balancing mechanism. The weights $w_c$ and $w_p$ in the reward function will be dynamically adjusted based on the model's performance:

$$w_c = \sigma\left(\lambda_c \cdot \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \text{Valid}(M_i)\right)$$

$$w_p = \sigma\left(\lambda_p \cdot \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \text{StablePhys}(M_i)\right)$$

where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, $\lambda_c$ and $\lambda_p$ are scaling factors, $\text{Valid}(M_i)$ is a binary indicator of chemical validity, and $\text{StablePhys}(M_i)$ is a binary indicator of physical stability.

### 7. Experimental Design

To validate our approach, we will conduct a comprehensive set of experiments:

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare our physics-informed RL framework against state-of-the-art molecular generation methods, including:
   - MolGPT (Transformer-based)

2. **Target-Specific Molecule Generation**: Generate molecules for three diverse protein targets:
   - SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (MPro)
   - Dopamine D2 Receptor (DRD2)
   - Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2)

3. **Ablation Studies**:
   - Impact of surrogate model accuracy on generation quality
   - Contribution of different physical metrics to overall performance
   - Effect of adaptive reward balancing on molecular diversity

### 8. Evaluation Metrics

1. **Chemical Metrics**:
   - Validity: Proportion of chemically valid molecules
