# Adaptive Mathematical Reasoning Assessment System (AMRAS): A Dynamic Framework for Evaluating LLM Mathematical Capabilities

## 1. Introduction

### Background
Mathematical reasoning stands at the core of human intellectual achievement, enabling advances across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated increasingly impressive capabilities in mathematical problem-solving, raising fundamental questions about the nature of machine intelligence and its relationship to human cognition. However, existing evaluation methods for mathematical reasoning in LLMs face significant challenges. Static benchmarks like MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021) become less effective over time as models are trained on web data potentially containing these benchmark problems. This phenomenon, known as data contamination, compromises our ability to accurately assess whether models are truly reasoning or merely retrieving memorized solutions.

Moreover, current evaluation methods often focus exclusively on final answer accuracy rather than the quality of the reasoning process. This limitation obscures our understanding of how models approach problems and whether they employ genuine mathematical reasoning or rely on pattern matching and statistical correlations. As noted by Xia et al. (2024), improvements in final-answer accuracy do not necessarily correlate with better reasoning quality, highlighting the need for more sophisticated evaluation methodologies.

### Research Objectives
This research proposal aims to develop and validate the Adaptive Mathematical Reasoning Assessment System (AMRAS), a dynamic framework that addresses these limitations through procedural content generation of mathematical problems. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Design a system capable of generating novel, contamination-resistant mathematical problems that target specific reasoning skills while controlling for difficulty and complexity.

2. Implement adaptive generation mechanisms that dynamically adjust problem characteristics based on model performance, creating a responsive evaluation framework.

3. Develop comprehensive metrics that evaluate not only answer accuracy but also reasoning quality, strategy selection, and generalization capabilities.

4. Create detailed diagnostic profiles of LLM mathematical reasoning abilities that identify specific strengths and weaknesses.

### Significance
The significance of this research extends across multiple dimensions:

**Theoretical Significance**: AMRAS will advance our understanding of mathematical cognition in LLMs, helping to disentangle genuine reasoning from mere pattern matching. This contributes to fundamental questions about the nature of intelligence and the potential for machines to engage in mathematical thinking.

**Methodological Significance**: By moving beyond static benchmarks toward dynamic, adaptive evaluations, this research establishes a new paradigm for assessing AI systems' capabilities. This approach can potentially extend beyond mathematical reasoning to other cognitive domains.

**Practical Significance**: Robust evaluation methods are essential for responsible AI development and deployment. AMRAS will provide more accurate assessments of model capabilities, helping developers identify limitations and guide improvement efforts. It also enables more informed decisions about deploying LLMs in high-stakes mathematical contexts such as education, scientific research, and engineering applications.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 System Architecture Overview

The Adaptive Mathematical Reasoning Assessment System (AMRAS) consists of four core components:

1. **Problem Template Repository**: A structured collection of mathematical problem templates across various domains and difficulty levels.
2. **Problem Generator**: A procedural content generation engine that instantiates templates into specific problem instances.
3. **Evaluation Module**: A component that analyzes model responses, scoring both answers and reasoning processes.
4. **Adaptation Engine**: A mechanism that modifies problem generation parameters based on model performance.

Figure 1 illustrates the system architecture and data flow between components:

### 2.2 Problem Template Repository

The Problem Template Repository will be organized hierarchically across multiple dimensions:

1. **Mathematical Domains**: Algebra, geometry, calculus, probability, number theory, and logic.
2. **Reasoning Types**: Deductive reasoning, algebraic manipulation, visual/spatial reasoning, pattern recognition, and quantitative comparison.
3. **Difficulty Levels**: Based on complexity metrics including computational steps, concept density, and required background knowledge.

Each template consists of:
- A parameterized problem structure with variable elements
- Constraints on parameter values to ensure problem validity
- Complexity metrics for difficulty estimation
- Expected solution approach(es)
- Metadata tags for categorization

Example template for a quadratic equation problem:

```
Template ID: ALG-QUAD-001
Type: Algebra - Quadratic Equations
Description: Word problem requiring formulation and solution of a quadratic equation
Template: "A rectangle has a perimeter of {p} units. If its length is {a} units more than its width, find the dimensions of the rectangle."
Parameters:
  - p: Integer [20, 100]
  - a: Integer [1, 10]
Constraints:
  - The solution must yield positive integer or simple fraction dimensions
Complexity Metrics:
  - Concept Count: 2 (rectangle properties, quadratic equation)
  - Solution Steps: 5
  - Cognitive Load: Medium
```

### 2.3 Problem Generator

The Problem Generator instantiates templates into specific problems through the following process:

1. **Parameter Sampling**: Select values for template parameters according to specified constraints and current difficulty target.
2. **Constraint Verification**: Check that the resulting problem satisfies all constraints (e.g., has a valid solution, meets complexity requirements).
3. **Natural Language Formulation**: Generate the final problem statement with appropriate context and question formulation.
4. **Reference Solution Generation**: Produce a correct solution and reasoning path for evaluation purposes.

The generator employs several key algorithms:

**Complexity Estimation Function**:
$$C(p) = \alpha \cdot C_{conceptual}(p) + \beta \cdot C_{computational}(p) + \gamma \cdot C_{structural}(p)$$

where:
- $C(p)$ is the overall complexity of problem $p$
- $C_{conceptual}(p)$ measures the number and difficulty of mathematical concepts involved
- $C_{computational}(p)$ quantifies the computational steps required
- $C_{structural}(p)$ represents the problem's structural complexity
- $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are weighting coefficients determined empirically

**Validity Check Algorithm**:
```
function checkValidity(problem, parameters):
    solution = solveSymbolically(problem, parameters)
    if not solution.exists():
        return False
    if not meetsConstraints(solution, problem.constraints):
        return False
    if estimateComplexity(problem, parameters) outside targetRange:
        return False
    return True
```

### 2.4 Evaluation Module

The Evaluation Module analyzes LLM responses along multiple dimensions:

1. **Answer Correctness**: Verify if the final numerical answer (or symbolic expression) is correct.
2. **Reasoning Quality**: Evaluate the validity and efficiency of the reasoning process.
3. **Strategy Appropriateness**: Assess whether the chosen solution approach is suitable for the problem.
4. **Generalization Detection**: Identify if the model is applying appropriate general principles rather than using problem-specific heuristics.

We will implement the following evaluation metrics:

**Reasoning Score Calculation**:
$$R(r) = w_1 \cdot S_{validity}(r) + w_2 \cdot S_{redundancy}(r) + w_3 \cdot S_{efficiency}(r)$$

where:
- $R(r)$ is the overall reasoning score for response $r$
- $S_{validity}(r)$ measures the mathematical validity of each step (scale 0-1)
- $S_{redundancy}(r)$ penalizes unnecessary steps (scale 0-1, higher is better)
- $S_{efficiency}(r)$ rewards more elegant or efficient approaches (scale 0-1)
- $w_1$, $w_2$, and $w_3$ are weighting coefficients

The validity score utilizes symbolic mathematics processing to verify each reasoning step:
$$S_{validity}(r) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} v(s_i)$$

where $v(s_i)$ is 1 if step $s_i$ is mathematically valid given the previous steps, and 0 otherwise.

### 2.5 Adaptation Engine

The Adaptation Engine modifies problem generation parameters based on model performance, implementing a form of intelligent difficulty adjustment:

**Problem Difficulty Adaptation**:
$$D_{t+1} = D_t + \eta \cdot (T - P_t)$$

where:
- $D_t$ is the target difficulty at time $t$
- $P_t$ is the model's performance at time $t$ (scaled 0-1)
- $T$ is the target performance level (typically 0.7-0.8)
- $\eta$ is a learning rate parameter controlling adaptation speed

**Strategic Adaptation Algorithm**:
When the model demonstrates mastery of one problem type, the system will:
1. Increase the difficulty of that problem type
2. Introduce structural variations that test the same reasoning skill
3. Combine the mastered skill with other skills to create more complex problems

When the model struggles with a problem type, the system will:
1. Generate simpler variations with more explicit clues
2. Break down the problem into component skills
3. Explore alternative formulations of the same underlying concept

### 2.6 Experimental Design

To validate AMRAS, we will conduct experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini, as well as open-source models like Llama-3 and Mistral. The experimental design involves:

**Phase 1: System Calibration**

2. Collect model responses to establish baseline performance profiles
3. Calibrate complexity metrics and adaptation parameters

**Phase 2: Dynamic Assessment**
1. Deploy AMRAS to conduct adaptive assessments of each model
2. Record performance trajectories as difficulty adapts
3. Develop detailed capability profiles for each model

**Phase 3: Comparative Analysis**
1. Compare AMRAS results with performance on standard benchmarks
2. Identify areas of potential data contamination
3. Analyze differences in reasoning approaches across models

**Phase 4: Generalization Testing**
1. Test models on novel problem variations not seen in training
2. Evaluate transfer learning across mathematical domains
3. Assess resistance to superficial problem transformations

### 2.7 Evaluation Metrics

We will use the following metrics to assess both model performance and the effectiveness of AMRAS:

**Model Performance Metrics**:
- Answer Accuracy: Percentage of correct final answers
- Reasoning Score: Quality of reasoning paths (as defined above)
- Adaptation Profile: How performance changes as problems adapt
- Generalization Index: Performance on novel variations vs. familiar structures

**AMRAS Effectiveness Metrics**:
- Discrimination Power: Ability to distinguish between models with different capabilities
- Contamination Resistance: Performance differences between potentially contaminated and novel problems
- Diagnostic Precision: Correlation between identified weaknesses and targeted interventions
- Test-Retest Reliability: Consistency of results across multiple assessment runs
