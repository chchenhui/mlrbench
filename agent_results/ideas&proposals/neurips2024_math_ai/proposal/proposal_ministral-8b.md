Adaptive Mathematical Reasoning Assessment via Procedural Problem Generation

## 2. Introduction

### Background

Mathematical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition that underpins many scientific, engineering, and everyday applications. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for AI to engage in mathematical reasoning tasks, ranging from solving complex problems to proving theorems. However, traditional benchmarks for evaluating mathematical reasoning, such as MATH and GSM8k, often suffer from issues like data contamination and limited problem diversity. These benchmarks may not accurately assess the true reasoning capabilities of LLMs, as they can be compromised by exposure to training data.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a system for adaptive mathematical reasoning assessment via procedural problem generation. This system aims to generate novel, diverse mathematical problems tailored to evaluate specific reasoning skills and adapt problem difficulty based on the LLM's performance. By doing so, we seek to:

1. **Mitigate Data Contamination**: Ensure that evaluation benchmarks are free from data contamination, providing a more accurate assessment of a model's reasoning capabilities.
2. **Enhance Problem Diversity**: Generate a wide range of problem instances that challenge different aspects of mathematical reasoning, promoting generalization.
3. **Assess Reasoning Processes**: Evaluate the quality of reasoning steps beyond final-answer accuracy, providing detailed diagnostic profiles of model strengths and weaknesses.
4. **Promote Adaptive Learning**: Enable LLMs to autonomously determine and apply appropriate reasoning strategies based on their intrinsic capabilities.

### Significance

The proposed research is significant for several reasons:

1. **Robust Evaluation**: By developing contamination-resistant benchmarks, we can provide a more accurate assessment of LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities.
2. **Enhanced Learning**: Adaptive problem generation can enhance the learning process by tailoring challenges to the model's performance, promoting better generalization and engagement.
3. **Practical Applications**: The proposed system can be applied to various domains, including software verification, sciences, engineering, finance, education, and mathematics itself.
4. **Theoretical Insights**: The research will contribute to our understanding of mathematical reasoning in AI, providing insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs.

## 3. Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed research involves several key components:

1. **Procedural Content Generation (PCG)**: Develop a system for generating mathematical problems based on templates and constraints. This system will create diverse problem instances, ensuring variance and controlling for difficulty.
2. **Adaptive Problem Generation**: Implement a mechanism to adapt problem generation based on the LLM's performance. The system will generate harder or stylistically different problems in areas where the model succeeds and simpler variations where it fails.
3. **Reasoning Quality Assessment**: Incorporate a methodology for evaluating the quality of reasoning steps, assessing validity and redundancy in the problem-solving process.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Define evaluation metrics to assess the overall performance and reasoning capabilities of the LLM.

### Data Collection

The data collection process will involve:

1. **Template Selection**: Curate a set of mathematical problem templates covering various reasoning skills, such as algebraic manipulation, geometric intuition, and logical deduction.
2. **Constraint Definition**: Define constraints for problem generation to control difficulty and ensure variance.
3. **Problem Generation**: Use the PCG system to generate diverse problem instances based on the selected templates and constraints.

### Algorithmic Steps

The algorithmic steps for the proposed system are as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Load the LLM and initialize the problem generation system.
   - Define the set of mathematical problem templates and constraints.

2. **Problem Generation**:
   - Select a template and apply constraints to generate a problem instance.
   - Evaluate the difficulty of the generated problem and adjust if necessary.

3. **LLM Interaction**:
   - Present the generated problem to the LLM and obtain the solution.
   - Analyze the LLM's performance and reasoning steps.

4. **Adaptive Problem Generation**:
   - Based on the LLM's performance, adapt the problem generation process.
   - Increase difficulty or change the problem style if the LLM performs well.
   - Decrease difficulty or simplify the problem style if the LLM struggles.

5. **Reasoning Quality Assessment**:
   - Evaluate the quality of the LLM's reasoning steps using a predefined methodology.
   - Assess validity and redundancy in the reasoning process.

6. **Evaluation**:
   - Define evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, reasoning quality, and generalization performance.
   - Evaluate the overall performance of the LLM based on the defined metrics.

### Mathematical Formulas

The following mathematical formulas illustrate the core concepts of the proposed system:

1. **Problem Generation**:
   $$ P = \text{Template}(T, C) $$
   where \( P \) is the generated problem, \( T \) is the selected template, and \( C \) are the applied constraints.

2. **Difficulty Adjustment**:
   $$ D_{new} = D_{old} + \Delta D $$
   where \( D_{new} \) is the new difficulty level, \( D_{old} \) is the current difficulty level, and \( \Delta D \) is the difficulty adjustment based on LLM performance.

3. **Reasoning Quality Assessment**:
   $$ Q = \text{Validity}(R) + \text{Redundancy}(R) $$
   where \( Q \) is the reasoning quality score, \( R \) is the reasoning process, and \( \text{Validity}(R) \) and \( \text{Redundancy}(R) \) are functions assessing the validity and redundancy of the reasoning steps, respectively.

### Experimental Design

To validate the proposed method, we will conduct the following experiments:

1. **Baseline Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of LLMs on static benchmarks (e.g., MATH, GSM8k) to establish a baseline.
2. **Proposed System Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of LLMs using the proposed adaptive problem generation system.
3. **Comparison Study**: Compare the results of the baseline evaluation and the proposed system evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.
4. **Generalization Study**: Evaluate the generalization performance of LLMs on entirely novel problem distributions to assess their ability to reason on unseen problems.

### Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation metrics for the proposed system will include:

1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly solved problems.
2. **Reasoning Quality**: The quality score of the reasoning steps, assessed using the ReasonEval methodology.
3. **Generalization Performance**: The performance of LLMs on entirely novel problem distributions.
