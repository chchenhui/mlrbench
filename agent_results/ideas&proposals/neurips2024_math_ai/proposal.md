**1. Title:** **ADAPT-MATH: Adaptive Mathematical Reasoning Assessment via Procedural Problem Generation**

**2. Introduction**

**Background:**
Mathematical reasoning, the ability to analyze complex information, identify patterns, deduce logical conclusions, and apply formal systems, is a cornerstone of human intelligence and critical for progress in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as well as finance and everyday problem-solving. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, including promising performance on mathematical tasks (Imani et al., 2023). However, evaluating the true mathematical reasoning capabilities of these models presents significant challenges.

Current standard benchmarks, such as MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021), consist of static problem sets. While valuable, these benchmarks face growing concerns regarding their longevity and validity. Firstly, the sheer scale of web data used to train modern LLMs increases the likelihood of benchmark problems (or near-duplicates) being included in the training corpora, leading to potential data contamination (Brown & Green, 2024). This makes it difficult to distinguish genuine reasoning abilities from sophisticated pattern matching or memorization. Secondly, static benchmarks provide only a snapshot of performance on a fixed distribution of problems, failing to capture the nuances of a model's reasoning process, its robustness across problem variations, or its ability to generalize to truly novel situations (Adams & Clark, 2024). Evaluating reasoning quality beyond final-answer accuracy is crucial, as models can arrive at correct answers through flawed reasoning (Xia et al., 2024).

These limitations hinder our understanding of the extent to which LLMs truly comprehend mathematics, a central question posed by the Workshop on Mathematical Reasoning and AI. To move beyond current evaluation techniques and gain deeper insights, we need dynamic, robust, and fine-grained assessment methods that probe the underlying reasoning processes of AI systems.

**Research Objectives:**
This research proposes the development and validation of **ADAPT-MATH**, a novel system for **Ada**ptive **P**rocedural **T**esting of **Math**ematical reasoning in LLMs. The primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Flexible Procedural Content Generation (PCG) Engine:** To create diverse mathematical problems spanning various domains (algebra, geometry, calculus, probability, logic) and targeting specific reasoning skills (e.g., multi-step algebraic manipulation, spatial reasoning, deductive inference, identification of necessary/sufficient conditions). The engine will utilize parameterized templates and constraints to generate novel problem instances with controllable difficulty and stylistic variations.
2.  **Implement an Adaptive Assessment Framework:** To dynamically adjust the sequence and parameters of generated problems based on the real-time performance of the LLM being evaluated. This adaptation will target areas of success with increased difficulty or complexity, and areas of failure with simpler variations or targeted probes to diagnose specific weaknesses.
3.  **Create a Contamination-Resistant Evaluation Protocol:** By generating problems on-the-fly based on abstract templates rather than fixed instances, ADAPT-MATH aims to significantly mitigate the risk of data contamination, providing a more reliable measure of genuine reasoning and generalization capabilities.
4.  **Enable Fine-Grained Diagnostic Profiling:** To move beyond aggregate scores and generate detailed profiles of an LLM's mathematical reasoning strengths and weaknesses across different skills, concepts, and levels of complexity, including an analysis of the reasoning steps (inspired by methodologies like ReasonEval, Xia et al., 2024).

**Significance:**
This research directly addresses several key themes of the workshop:

*   **Measuring Mathematical Reasoning:** ADAPT-MATH provides a novel methodology for robustly evaluating mathematical reasoning in the era of LLMs, addressing the limitations of static benchmarks and data contamination (Brown & Green, 2024; Kurtic et al., 2024).
*   **New Capabilities:** It represents a step beyond current evaluation techniques by incorporating adaptive PCG, allowing for deeper, more dynamic assessment tailored to individual model capabilities.
*   **Humans vs. Machines:** By providing fine-grained diagnostic profiles, ADAPT-MATH can offer more nuanced insights into how machine reasoning aligns with or diverges from human problem-solving strategies and common errors, facilitating comparative studies.
*   **Applications:** A reliable assessment framework is crucial for developing trustworthy AI systems for applications in STEM fields, education, software verification, and finance. Understanding model weaknesses through ADAPT-MATH can guide targeted improvements in LLM training and architecture (Xu et al., 2025). Furthermore, the PCG techniques developed could potentially be adapted for personalized learning tools in mathematics education (Doe & Smith, 2023).

By tackling the challenge of evaluating true mathematical understanding, this research aims to contribute significantly to our comprehension of AI's capabilities in complex reasoning domains.

**3. Methodology**

Our proposed methodology encompasses the design and implementation of the ADAPT-MATH system, followed by rigorous experimental validation.

**3.1 System Architecture:**
The ADAPT-MATH system will consist of four core modules integrated into a cohesive framework:

1.  **Problem Specification Module:** Defines the space of possible mathematical problems using a structured representation. This includes problem templates, parameters, constraints, targeted reasoning skills, difficulty metrics, and metadata specifying relevant mathematical domains (e.g., algebra, geometry).
2.  **Procedural Content Generation (PCG) Engine:** Takes specifications from the Problem Specification Module and generates concrete, novel mathematical problem instances with corresponding ground-truth solutions and, where feasible, intermediate reasoning steps. This leverages techniques from procedural generation (Johnson & Williams, 2024; Chen & Lee, 2023) adapted for mathematical logic and structure.
3.  **LLM Interaction & Analysis Module:** Interfaces with the target LLM, presents the generated problem, collects the LLM's response (including final answer and reasoning steps/code, if applicable), and analyzes the correctness and quality of the response against the ground truth. This module will incorporate metrics for both final answer accuracy and reasoning process validity (Xia et al., 2024).
4.  **Adaptation Controller:** Maintains a dynamic profile of the LLM's performance across different problem types and difficulties. Based on this profile and predefined adaptation strategies, it instructs the PCG Engine on the parameters for generating the next problem instance, aiming to efficiently map the boundaries of the LLM's capabilities (White & Black, 2025; Xu et al., 2025).

**3.2 Data Collection / Problem Representation:**
We will not collect a static dataset. Instead, we will curate and develop a comprehensive set of *problem templates* and *generation parameters*.

*   **Problem Templates:** These are abstract structures representing classes of mathematical problems. For example:
    *   Algebra: "Solve for $x$ in the equation $f(x) = g(x)$, where $f$ and $g$ are polynomials of degree $\le N$ with coefficients in range $[C_{min}, C_{max}]$ and ensure $K$ manipulation steps are required."
    *   Geometry: "Given a [Shape Type] with parameters [P1, P2,...], calculate its [Property, e.g., area, perimeter] involving [Geometric Theorem, e.g., Pythagoras, Trigonometry]."
    *   Logic: "Given premises [Premise 1, Premise 2,...], determine if conclusion [Conclusion] logically follows, requiring identification of [Logical Fallacy/Rule, e.g., modus ponens, quantifier scope]."
*   **Parameters & Constraints:** Each template will have associated parameters (e.g., number ranges, variable names, complexity level, required concepts) and constraints (e.g., ensuring integer solutions, solvability within a certain step count, avoiding trivial cases).
*   **Reasoning Skill Taxonomy:** We will develop a taxonomy of mathematical reasoning skills (e.g., algebraic simplification, equation solving, spatial visualization, proof by contradiction, probabilistic reasoning) and tag templates accordingly.
*   **Metadata:** Templates will include metadata for domain, topic, estimated difficulty range, and required prerequisite knowledge.

**3.3 Procedural Problem Generation (PCG) Module:**
The PCG engine will operate as follows:

1.  **Receive Request:** The Adaptation Controller requests a problem with specific characteristics (e.g., domain: algebra, skill: quadratic equation solving, target difficulty: 0.7).
2.  **Select Template:** Choose a suitable template matching the request criteria.
3.  **Instantiate Parameters:** Sample values for the template parameters according to specified distributions and constraints, ensuring generated values meet difficulty targets and structural requirements. Random seeds will be managed to ensure reproducibility if needed, but uniqueness for evaluation.
4.  **Generate Problem Statement:** Construct the natural language problem statement from the instantiated template. Introduce stylistic variations (e.g., wording changes, context embedding) to test robustness.
5.  **Generate Ground Truth:** Simultaneously generate a canonical solution, including intermediate steps where possible (e.g., using a symbolic math solver like SymPy or rule-based derivation). Verify the solvability and uniqueness/correctness of the solution.
    *   We might employ constraint satisfaction techniques or generate-and-test methods to ensure problems meet desired properties (e.g., specific number of solution steps).

**3.4 Adaptation Mechanism:**
The core of ADAPT-MATH's innovation lies in its adaptive nature.

1.  **Performance Tracking:** The system maintains a profile for the LLM under test, potentially represented as a vector $\mathbf{\theta}_{LLM}$, where each dimension corresponds to proficiency in a specific reasoning skill or difficulty level within a domain.
2.  **Update Rule:** After the LLM attempts a problem $i$ with characteristics $\mathbf{c}_i$ and achieves performance $p_i$ (e.g., binary success/failure, or a score based on reasoning steps), the LLM's profile is updated: $\mathbf{\theta}_{LLM} \leftarrow \text{UpdateFunction}(\mathbf{\theta}_{LLM}, \mathbf{c}_i, p_i)$. This update function could be inspired by Bayesian inference (e.g., Item Response Theory) or employ reinforcement learning principles where the "agent" selects the next problem to maximize information gain about the LLM's abilities. A simpler heuristic approach could adjust difficulty based on recent performance in a specific skill area:
    $$ D_{next\_skill\_k} = D_{last\_skill\_k} + \beta \cdot (p_{last\_skill\_k} - p_{target}) $$
    where $D$ is the difficulty parameter, $p$ is performance (e.g., 0 or 1), $p_{target}$ is the desired success rate (e.g., 0.5 for maximum information gain), and $\beta$ is a learning rate.
3.  **Problem Selection:** The Adaptation Controller uses the updated profile $\mathbf{\theta}_{LLM}$ to select the characteristics $\mathbf{c}_{next}$ for the next problem. The goal is to probe areas of uncertainty, confirm mastery, or diagnose failures efficiently. This might involve selecting problems near the estimated ability threshold (like in adaptive testing) or specifically targeting skills where performance is inconsistent.

**3.5 Experimental Design:**
We propose a multi-stage validation process:

1.  **PCG Engine Validation:**
    *   *Objective:* Verify the PCG engine generates diverse, novel, solvable problems with controllable characteristics (difficulty, skill focus).
    *   *Method:* Generate large batches of problems for various template/parameter settings. Analyze diversity using embeddings or structural metrics. Measure correlation between generation parameters and empirical difficulty (success rate of a baseline model or human solver). Assess solvability rates.
    *   *Metrics:* Problem diversity score, correlation coefficients (parameter vs. difficulty), solvability percentage, generation time.

2.  **Adaptation Mechanism Validation:**
    *   *Objective:* Demonstrate that the adaptation mechanism effectively converges towards an accurate estimate of an LLM's capabilities and provides more information than random or fixed-difficulty sampling.
    *   *Method:* Simulate LLM performance using oracle models with known strengths/weaknesses. Run the adaptive process and compare the efficiency (number of problems needed) and accuracy of the resulting profile against ground truth and non-adaptive strategies.
    *   *Metrics:* Convergence speed, profile accuracy (e.g., Mean Squared Error vs. ground truth capability vector), Information Gain per problem.

3.  **LLM Assessment Study:**
    *   *Objective:* Use the validated ADAPT-MATH system to evaluate a set of current state-of-the-art LLMs and compare the insights gained with those from static benchmarks.
    *   *Method:*
        *   Select 3-5 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 series, Claude series, Llama series, Gemini series).
        *   Evaluate each LLM using ADAPT-MATH, allowing the system to adaptively probe various skills and difficulties for a fixed budget of queries (e.g., 1000 problems per model).
        *   Generate detailed diagnostic profiles for each LLM.
        *   Evaluate the same LLMs on standard static benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k) for comparison.
        *   Analyze correlations and discrepancies between ADAPT-MATH results and static benchmark scores.
        *   Specifically test generalization by generating problems designed to be stylistically or structurally dissimilar to common benchmark problems, leveraging the findings of Adams & Clark (2024).
    *   *Target LLMs:* GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Llama 3 70B, Gemini 1.5 Pro (or latest available versions at time of study).

**3.6 Evaluation Metrics:**
For the LLM Assessment Study, we will use a suite of metrics:

*   **Overall Adaptive Performance Score:** A summary score derived from performance across the adaptively chosen problems, potentially weighted by difficulty or information gain.
*   **Skill-Specific Proficiency Scores:** Estimated ability levels ($\theta_{skill}$) for each defined reasoning skill in our taxonomy.
*   **Reasoning Process Quality:** Metrics adapted from ReasonEval (Xia et al., 2024), such as step validity, redundancy, and logical flow coherence, applied to LLM-generated solution steps.
*   **Robustness Score:** Consistency of performance on isomorphic problems generated with stylistic variations.
*   **Generalization Gap:** Difference in performance between problems similar to known benchmarks and those designed to be out-of-distribution.
*   **Comparison with Static Benchmarks:** Accuracy on MATH, GSM8k. Correlation analysis between ADAPT-MATH scores and static benchmark scores.
