**2. Key Challenges**

1. **Data Contamination**: Ensuring that evaluation benchmarks are free from data contamination is crucial, as exposure to test data during training can lead to inflated performance metrics that do not accurately reflect a model's reasoning capabilities.

2. **Adaptive Problem Generation**: Developing systems that can dynamically generate and adjust the difficulty of mathematical problems based on model performance is challenging. Such systems must balance providing appropriate challenges without leading to overfitting or underfitting.

3. **Evaluation of Reasoning Processes**: Assessing the quality of reasoning steps, beyond final-answer accuracy, is complex. It requires methodologies that can evaluate the validity and efficiency of intermediate steps in problem-solving processes.

4. **Generalization to Unseen Problems**: Ensuring that LLMs can generalize their mathematical reasoning to entirely new problem distributions is a significant challenge. Models often struggle with problems that deviate from their training data, highlighting limitations in their reasoning abilities.

5. **Balancing Multiple Reasoning Strategies**: Enabling LLMs to autonomously select and apply appropriate reasoning strategies based on their intrinsic capabilities requires sophisticated training and evaluation frameworks. Balancing different strategies effectively remains an open research question.
