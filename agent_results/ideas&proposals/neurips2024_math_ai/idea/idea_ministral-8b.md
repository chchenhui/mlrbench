### Title: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in AI with Multi-modal Learning

### Motivation:
Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of human intelligence, yet current AI models struggle with its complexity and nuances. This research aims to bridge the gap between human and machine mathematical reasoning by leveraging multi-modal learning. By integrating text, images, and symbolic representations, we can enable AI models to comprehend and generate mathematical proofs more effectively.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research focuses on developing a multi-modal learning framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with computer vision and symbolic reasoning systems. This approach will enable AI models to process and understand mathematical content from various modalities, enhancing their ability to reason mathematically.

**Methodology:**
1. **Data Collection:** Gather a diverse dataset of mathematical problems, proofs, and images, such as those found in textbooks, research papers, and educational resources.
2. **Preprocessing:** Annotate data with relevant metadata, including problem types, solution steps, and any visual components.
3. **Model Architecture:** Design a multi-modal model that incorporates LLM for text understanding, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing, and symbolic reasoning modules for formal proofs.
4. **Training:** Train the model using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques, focusing on tasks like problem-solving, theorem proving, and visual reasoning.
5. **Evaluation:** Develop benchmark datasets to assess the model's performance in mathematical reasoning tasks, comparing it with human performance and existing AI models.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Improved AI models capable of understanding and generating mathematical proofs.
- Enhanced collaboration between humans and AI in mathematical problem-solving.
- New educational tools for teaching and learning mathematics, especially in resource-limited contexts.

**Potential Impact:**
This research has the potential to revolutionize how AI interacts with mathematics, leading to breakthroughs in software verification, scientific discovery, and educational tools. It also paves the way for more advanced AI systems capable of high-level reasoning and problem-solving across various domains.
