# SymGPT: A Symbolic Reasoning Layer for Enhanced LLM Mathematical Performance

## Motivation
While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in mathematical reasoning, they still struggle with complex calculations, systematic derivations, and proof verification. The statistical nature of LLMs means they approximate rather than execute precise mathematical operations. This fundamental limitation restricts their reliability for applications requiring mathematical certainty, such as formal verification, scientific computing, and educational tools where correctness is non-negotiable. A solution bridging LLMs' natural language understanding with precise symbolic computation could significantly advance AI's mathematical reasoning capabilities.

## Main Idea
SymGPT proposes a novel architecture that integrates a symbolic reasoning layer with traditional LLMs. When encountering mathematical problems, the system dynamically routes computation to either the neural or symbolic component based on task requirements. The symbolic layer can execute precise algebraic manipulations, calculus operations, and formal proofs using established computer algebra systems. This hybrid approach maintains the language model's flexibility while guaranteeing mathematical correctness. The system will include a self-verification mechanism whereby the LLM can reflect on the symbolic solver's results and request clarification when needed. We aim to create a benchmarking suite specifically designed to evaluate this symbolic-neural integration, measuring both accuracy and the system's ability to explain its reasoning process transparently to users.
