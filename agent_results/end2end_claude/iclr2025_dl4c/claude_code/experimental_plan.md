# Experimental Plan for MACP Framework Evaluation

## 1. Experiment Overview

This experiment aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Multi-Agent Collaborative Programming (MACP) framework compared to baseline single-agent approaches for solving programming tasks. The MACP framework structures AI agents into specialized roles mirroring human software development teams (architect, implementer, tester, reviewer) with a moderator meta-agent for coordination.

## 2. Research Questions

1. Does the MACP framework produce higher quality code solutions compared to single-agent approaches?
2. How do different team structures and role specializations affect performance?
3. What communication patterns emerge between specialized agents?
4. How does the MACP framework perform across tasks of varying complexity?
5. What is the impact of the moderator meta-agent on team coordination and conflict resolution?

## 3. Experimental Setup

### 3.1 Models

- **Base LLM**: Claude-3.7-sonnet (via API) for all agents
- **Prompt Engineering**: Role-specific prompts to create specialized agents

### 3.2 Systems to Compare

1. **Single-Agent Baseline**: A single LLM-based agent that attempts to solve the entire programming task.
2. **MACP Framework**: Multiple specialized agents with defined roles collaborating to solve tasks:
   - Architect Agent: Responsible for high-level design
   - Implementer Agent: Translates designs into code
   - Tester Agent: Creates test cases and verifies functionality
   - Reviewer Agent: Evaluates code quality and suggests improvements
   - Moderator Meta-Agent: Coordinates team activities and resolves conflicts
3. **Ablation Studies**:
   - MACP without Moderator
   - MACP with different communication protocols
   - MACP with varying team structures

### 3.3 Dataset and Tasks

For feasibility in this experimental setup, we'll use a subset of programming tasks:

1. **Programming Tasks Dataset**: A set of 5 programming tasks of varying complexity:
   - Simple: Function implementations (e.g., sorting algorithms, string manipulation)
   - Moderate: Class implementations with multiple methods
   - Complex: Small system design with multiple components

Each task will include:
- A problem description
- Requirements specification
- Evaluation criteria

## 4. Evaluation Metrics

### 4.1 Solution Correctness
- Functional correctness (pass/fail on test cases)
- Bug density (bugs per 1000 lines of code)
- Test coverage percentage

### 4.2 Solution Quality
- Code complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity)
- Maintainability index
- Adherence to best practices and patterns

### 4.3 Efficiency Metrics
- Time to solution
- Number of messages exchanged
- Number of iterations required

### 4.4 Collaboration Metrics
- Communication patterns analysis
- Knowledge distribution among agents
- Conflict frequency and resolution time

## 5. Experimental Procedure

1. **Task Initialization**:
   - Present each system with the same programming task
   - Record initial time stamp

2. **Solution Development**:
   - For single-agent: Allow the agent to work on the entire task
   - For MACP: Initialize all agents with their roles and facilitate communication

3. **Data Collection**:
   - Record all agent interactions
   - Capture intermediate artifacts (designs, code drafts, tests)
   - Log time taken for each phase

4. **Solution Evaluation**:
   - Run automated test suites on final solutions
   - Calculate quality metrics using code analysis tools
   - Evaluate communication patterns and collaboration metrics

5. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Compare performance across systems for each task
   - Analyze the impact of different components through ablation studies
   - Identify patterns and insights from collaboration data

## 6. Implementation Plan

1. **Framework Development**:
   - Implement the base agent architecture
   - Develop role-specific agent prompts and knowledge
   - Create communication protocol and artifact sharing mechanisms
   - Implement the moderator meta-agent

2. **Evaluation Infrastructure**:
   - Set up test runners and validation tools
   - Implement code quality assessment tools
   - Develop collaboration metrics analysis tools

3. **Experiment Execution**:
   - Run all systems on each programming task
   - Collect and store results
   - Generate visualizations and analysis

## 7. Expected Outcomes

1. The MACP framework will produce higher quality solutions than single-agent approaches, especially for complex tasks.
2. Role specialization will lead to more comprehensive test coverage and better code quality.
3. The moderator meta-agent will significantly improve coordination efficiency and conflict resolution.
4. Different communication protocols will show varying effectiveness depending on task complexity.
5. Emergent collaboration patterns will reveal insights into effective team structures for AI coding agents.

## 8. Visualization and Analysis Plan

1. **Performance Comparison Visualizations**:
   - Bar charts comparing metrics across systems
   - Radar charts showing multi-dimensional performance profiles
   - Box plots showing variance in performance across tasks

2. **Communication Network Analysis**:
   - Node-link diagrams showing agent interaction patterns
   - Heat maps of message frequency between roles
   - Time-series visualization of communication volume

3. **Quality Metrics Tracking**:
   - Line charts showing quality metrics over iterations
   - Comparative visualizations of code complexity across systems
   - Spider charts for multi-metric quality comparisons

## 9. Documentation Plan

1. **Results Report**:
   - Summary of key findings
   - Detailed metric analysis
   - Visualization interpretation
   - Implications for multi-agent collaboration

2. **Methodology Documentation**:
   - Framework implementation details
