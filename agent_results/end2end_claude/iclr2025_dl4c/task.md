The thrid DL4C workshop titled "Emergent Possibilities and Challenges in Deep Learning for Code" provides a vibrant platform for researchers to share their work on deep learning for code, emphasizing emergent possibilities and challenges, for example: agentic methods for programming tasks, post-training and alignment for code, developer productivity and HCI for code, open science and responsible AI for code, and benchmarking and evaluation for code.

We invite original research paper submissions from any topic that is relevant to deep learning for code. This year, we specifically welcome submissions addressing recent challenges like:

- Agentic Methods for Programming Tasks Agents able to solve realistic coding tasks, such as solving GitHub issues or software developing tasks.

- Post-training and Alignment for Code Alignment for code, including but not limited to how to learn from human feedback, execution feedback, and AI feedback for better code generation.

- Developer Productivity and HCI for Code Adaptation of models to usersâ€™ needs to increas developer productivity, including studies on human-AI interaction for code from different disciplines (Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction, and Software Engineering, etc.).

- Open Science and Responsible AI for Code Contributions from researchers who follow responsible AI practices and strive for openness and transparency in their work and who are willing to share their code, models, and data. We also welcome contributions from researchers interested in developing open science practices for deep learning for code.

- Benchmarking and Evaluation for Code Benchmarks for code such execution-based benchmarks, code understanding, code efficiency, model-based judges, and project-level context.

Other topics of interest include but are not limited to, for example:

- Reinforcement Learning for Code
- Data for Code
- Pre-training Methods and Representation for Code
- Natural Language To Code
- Formal Methods for Code
- Program Repair
- Code Translation
- Code Explanation
- Code Summarization
- Code Generation for Applications Beyond Code such as Reasoning, Decision Making, and Algorithmic Discovery
