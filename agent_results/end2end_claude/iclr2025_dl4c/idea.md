# Multi-Agent Collaborative Programming Framework: A Team-Based Approach to Software Development

## Motivation
Current agentic methods for programming tasks often rely on single agents with limited perspectives. This approach falls short when tackling complex software development challenges that typically require multiple specialized roles in human teams. Additionally, existing agents lack the social dynamics and collaborative problem-solving capabilities that characterize effective human development teams. As AI systems take on increasingly complex programming tasks, there's a pressing need to develop collaborative multi-agent frameworks that can share knowledge, distribute workload, and iteratively improve solutions through structured interaction.

## Main Idea
We propose a Multi-Agent Collaborative Programming (MACP) framework that structures AI agents into specialized roles mirroring human software development teams (architect, implementer, tester, reviewer). Each agent has specialized knowledge, tools, and evaluation metrics. The framework includes a coordination protocol enabling structured information exchange through artifacts (design documents, code snippets, test results) and a meta-agent moderator that manages workflow and resolves conflicts. MACP supports asynchronous development through shared memory and version control, with agents capable of self-critique and negotiation to refine solutions. We'll evaluate MACP on real-world GitHub issues and complex development tasks while comparing it to both individual agent and human team performance. This approach could significantly enhance AI capabilities for collaborative software development, closely mirroring human team dynamics.
