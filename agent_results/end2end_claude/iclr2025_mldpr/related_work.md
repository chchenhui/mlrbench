1. **Title**: A Framework for Deprecating Datasets: Standardizing Documentation, Identification, and Communication (arXiv:2111.04424)
   - **Authors**: Alexandra Sasha Luccioni, Frances Corry, Hamsini Sridharan, Mike Ananny, Jason Schultz, Kate Crawford
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces a Dataset Deprecation Framework to address the lack of standardized procedures for deprecating datasets in machine learning. The framework includes considerations of risk, mitigation of impact, appeal mechanisms, timeline, post-deprecation protocols, and publication checks. It also proposes creating a centralized repository system for archiving datasets, tracking modifications or deprecations, and facilitating practices of care and stewardship.

   - **Authors**: Bernard Koch, Emily Denton, Alex Hanna, Jacob G. Foster
   - **Summary**: This study examines the dynamics of dataset usage in machine learning from 2015 to 2020, highlighting increasing concentration on fewer datasets within task communities and significant adoption of datasets from other tasks. The findings underscore the need for standardized dataset deprecation procedures to manage the lifecycle of datasets effectively.

3. **Title**: A critical examination of robustness and generalizability of machine learning prediction of materials properties (arXiv:2210.13597)
   - **Authors**: Kangming Li, Brian DeCost, Kamal Choudhary, Michael Greenwood, Jason Hattrick-Simpers
   - **Summary**: This paper investigates the degradation in prediction performance of machine learning models trained on older datasets when applied to newer datasets, due to distribution shifts. It emphasizes the importance of dataset versioning and the need for mechanisms to handle outdated datasets, aligning with the proposed framework's goals.

4. **Title**: DeltaGrad: Rapid retraining of machine learning models (arXiv:2006.14755)
   - **Authors**: Yinjun Wu, Edgar Dobriban, Susan B. Davidson
   - **Summary**: The authors propose DeltaGrad, an algorithm for rapid retraining of machine learning models when datasets are modified, such as through the addition or deletion of data points. This work is relevant to the deprecation framework as it offers a method to efficiently update models in response to dataset changes.

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Lack of Standardized Deprecation Procedures**: The absence of uniform guidelines for dataset deprecation leads to inconsistent practices, causing confusion and potential misuse of outdated or problematic datasets.

2. **Communication of Deprecation Status**: Effectively notifying users about a dataset's deprecation status and the reasons behind it is challenging, potentially resulting in continued use of deprecated datasets.

3. **Preservation of Research Continuity**: Balancing the removal or restriction of access to deprecated datasets while maintaining the integrity and reproducibility of existing research that utilized these datasets is a significant challenge.

4. **Identification and Management of Dataset Issues**: Detecting ethical, legal, or technical issues in datasets post-publication and deciding on appropriate deprecation actions require robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.

5. **Implementation in Existing Repositories**: Integrating a deprecation framework into current dataset repositories necessitates technical modifications and cooperation among various stakeholders, which can be complex and resource-intensive.
