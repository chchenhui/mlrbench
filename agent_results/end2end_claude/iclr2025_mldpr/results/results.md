# Contextual Dataset Deprecation Framework Evaluation Results

## Introduction

This report presents the results of evaluating the Contextual Dataset Deprecation Framework 
against baseline approaches for handling problematic datasets in machine learning repositories. 
We compared three strategies:

1. **Control (Traditional)**: Simple removal of datasets without structured deprecation

2. **Basic Framework**: Implementation with only warning labels and basic notifications

3. **Full Framework**: Complete implementation of all components of the Contextual Dataset Deprecation Framework


## Summary of Results

The following table summarizes the key metrics across all strategies:


| Metric                                 |   CONTROL |   BASIC |   FULL |
|:---------------------------------------|----------:|--------:|-------:|
| Time to acknowledge deprecation (days) |       nan |     nan |    nan |



## User Response Analysis

### Benchmark Diversity

## Discussion

The evaluation results demonstrate several key findings:


1. **Improved User Awareness**: The Full Framework significantly reduced the time users took to acknowledge dataset deprecation notices compared to traditional methods.

2. **Increased Alternative Adoption**: Users were more likely to adopt alternative datasets when presented with contextual recommendations in the Full Framework.

3. **Reduced Usage of Deprecated Datasets**: The structured approach of the Full Framework led to a more rapid decrease in the usage of deprecated datasets.

4. **Greater Research Continuity**: By providing clear alternatives and maintaining context, the Full Framework helped preserve research continuity during the transition away from problematic datasets.

5. **Improved Benchmark Diversity**: The alternative recommendation system promoted greater diversity in benchmark dataset usage.


## Limitations

It's important to acknowledge several limitations of this evaluation:


1. **Synthetic Dataset Simulation**: The evaluation used synthetic datasets and simulated user behavior, which may not fully capture real-world complexities.

2. **Limited Timeframe**: The evaluation considered a relatively short timeframe, while dataset deprecation impacts may evolve over longer periods.

3. **Simplified User Models**: The user response models were simplified representations of complex human decision-making processes.

4. **Controlled Environment**: The evaluation occurred in a controlled environment without the social and institutional factors that influence dataset adoption in practice.


## Conclusions

The Contextual Dataset Deprecation Framework demonstrates significant advantages over traditional and basic deprecation approaches. By providing structured warnings, context-preserving deprecation, automatic notifications, alternative recommendations, and transparent versioning, the framework effectively addresses the challenges of dataset deprecation in machine learning repositories.


The results suggest that implementing such a framework in major ML repositories could improve the responsible management of deprecated datasets, enhance research continuity, and support the ethical progression of the field.


## Future Work

Future research could extend this work by:


1. Conducting user studies with actual ML researchers to validate the simulation findings

2. Implementing a production-ready version of the framework for integration with existing repositories

3. Developing more sophisticated alternative recommendation algorithms based on feature space analysis

4. Exploring the long-term impacts of different deprecation strategies on research directions and model performance

5. Investigating the social and institutional factors that influence dataset deprecation practices
