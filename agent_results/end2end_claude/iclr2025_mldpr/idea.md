# Title: Contextual Dataset Deprecation Framework

## Motivation
As ML datasets proliferate, many become outdated or reveal ethical issues post-publication. Current repositories lack standardized processes for dataset deprecation, leading to continued use of problematic datasets. When datasets are deprecated, it often happens without clear communication about why they were removed and what alternatives exist. This creates confusion in the research community and impedes progress toward more responsible ML practices. A systematic approach to dataset deprecation is essential to maintain the integrity of ML research and reduce harm.

## Main Idea
We propose a Contextual Dataset Deprecation Framework that formalizes the process of retiring problematic datasets while preserving research continuity. The framework includes: (1) A tiered warning system with increasingly severe labels (caution, limited use, deprecated) based on documented issues; (2) Automated notifications to previous users when a dataset's status changes; (3) Context-preserving deprecation that maintains dataset metadata and documentation while restricting access; (4) Required alternative dataset recommendations when deprecating widely-used benchmarks; and (5) A transparent versioning system documenting the dataset's lifecycle. Implementation in repositories would include a dedicated "Dataset Retirement" section highlighting deprecated datasets and their alternatives. This approach ensures ethical accountability while avoiding the knowledge gaps created by complete dataset removal, ultimately fostering responsible progression in ML research.
