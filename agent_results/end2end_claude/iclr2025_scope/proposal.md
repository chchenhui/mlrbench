# Adaptive Token-Relevance Sparse KV-Cache for Efficient Long Context Understanding

## Introduction

Foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating text across various domains. However, as these models are tasked with processing increasingly longer contexts—ranging from thousands to potentially millions of tokens—they face significant computational and memory bottlenecks that impede their practical deployment. The key challenge lies in the quadratic scaling of attention mechanisms with respect to sequence length, leading to prohibitive memory requirements for the key-value (KV) cache during inference.

The KV cache, which stores precomputed key and value representations for tokens in the input sequence, enables efficient autoregressive generation by avoiding redundant computations during decoding. However, as context lengths grow, the memory footprint of the KV cache expands dramatically, becoming a critical limitation for deployment on memory-constrained devices and for real-time applications. Current approaches to address this challenge often rely on fixed eviction strategies based on token position or adopt uniform compression techniques that fail to account for the varying importance of different tokens within a context.

Recent work has explored several directions to mitigate these challenges. DynamicKV (Zhou et al., 2024) proposes layer-wise token retention based on task-specific patterns, while MEDA (Wan et al., 2025) leverages cross-modal attention entropy for multimodal contexts. KVLink (Yang et al., 2025) and RocketKV (Behnam et al., 2025) introduce novel approaches for KV cache reuse and compression. However, these methods typically do not exploit fine-grained token-level relevance prediction that adapts dynamically to the evolving context during inference.

This research addresses this critical gap by proposing Adaptive Token-Relevance Sparse KV-Cache (ATSKV), a novel approach that dynamically predicts the contextual relevance of each token's KV representation and selectively retains only the most important information. Our approach differs from existing methods by introducing a learnable token-level relevance prediction mechanism that continuously refines its predictions during inference, enabling more precise and adaptive sparsity patterns. By integrating this with an efficient retrieval mechanism, ATSKV can offload less relevant tokens to external memory and retrieve them only when needed, significantly reducing GPU memory requirements while maintaining model performance.

The objectives of this research are threefold:
1. Develop a lightweight token relevance prediction mechanism that can accurately identify the most contextually important tokens
2. Design an adaptive KV cache management system that dynamically updates sparsity patterns during inference
3. Evaluate the proposed approach across diverse long-context benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing memory footprint while preserving model performance

The significance of this research lies in its potential to enable much more efficient long-context understanding in foundation models. By addressing the KV cache bottleneck, ATSKV could facilitate deployment of these models in resource-constrained environments and enable the processing of substantially longer contexts than currently possible. This has implications for a wide range of applications, including document analysis, conversational AI, and multimodal reasoning, where the ability to maintain and process extended context is essential.

## Methodology

Our proposed Adaptive Token-Relevance Sparse KV-Cache (ATSKV) methodology consists of three main components: (1) a token relevance prediction module, (2) an adaptive sparsity management system, and (3) an external memory integration mechanism. This section details the design and implementation of each component.

### 3.1 Token Relevance Prediction

To accurately predict the contextual relevance of each token's KV representation, we develop a lightweight neural network that runs alongside the main foundation model. This relevance predictor takes as input the token representations and attention patterns from the main model and outputs a relevance score for each token at each layer.

For a given layer $l$ and token position $i$, we compute the relevance score $r_i^l$ as:

$$r_i^l = \sigma\left(w_r^T \cdot [h_i^l; a_i^l; f_i^l] + b_r\right)$$

where:
- $h_i^l$ is the hidden state representation of token $i$ at layer $l$
- $a_i^l$ is a feature vector derived from the attention patterns for token $i$ at layer $l$
- $f_i^l$ is a set of handcrafted features capturing token characteristics
- $w_r$ and $b_r$ are learnable parameters
- $\sigma$ is the sigmoid activation function

The attention-derived feature $a_i^l$ captures the token's importance based on how frequently it is attended to by other tokens:

$$a_i^l = \frac{1}{H} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \left[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{j,i}^{l,h} \right]$$

where $A_{j,i}^{l,h}$ represents the attention weight from token $j$ to token $i$ in attention head $h$ at layer $l$, $H$ is the number of attention heads, and $n$ is the sequence length.

The handcrafted features $f_i^l$ include:
1. Token type information (e.g., whether it's a special token, numeric, named entity)
2. Positional information (normalized position in the sequence)
3. Layer-specific statistics (e.g., norm of the hidden state)
4. Historical attention patterns (aggregated from previous layers)

To make the relevance predictor computationally efficient, we leverage a small MLP architecture with dimensionality reduction:

$$r_i^l = \sigma(W_2 \cdot \text{ReLU}(W_1 \cdot [h_i^l; a_i^l; f_i^l] + b_1) + b_2)$$

where $W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_r \times d_i}$, $W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times d_r}$, $d_i$ is the input dimension, and $d_r$ is a reduced dimension (typically 32 or 64).

### 3.2 Adaptive Sparsity Management

Based on the predicted relevance scores, we implement an adaptive sparsity management system that determines which tokens' KV pairs to retain in the cache. We employ a dynamic thresholding approach that adapts to the current context:

$$\mathcal{M}_i^l = \mathbb{1}[r_i^l > \tau^l(t)]$$

where $\mathcal{M}_i^l$ is a binary mask indicating whether to retain the KV pair for token $i$ at layer $l$, and $\tau^l(t)$ is a layer-specific threshold that varies with decoding step $t$.

The threshold $\tau^l(t)$ is computed as:

$$\tau^l(t) = \beta^l \cdot \text{quantile}(\{r_i^l\}_{i=1}^n, q^l(t))$$

where $\beta^l$ is a layer-specific scaling factor, and $q^l(t)$ determines the quantile threshold. The quantile function $q^l(t)$ adaptively changes based on the current memory usage and target sparsity level:

$$q^l(t) = q_{\text{min}}^l + (q_{\text{max}}^l - q_{\text{min}}^l) \cdot \min\left(1, \frac{M_{\text{current}}}{M_{\text{target}}}\right)$$

where $q_{\text{min}}^l$ and $q_{\text{max}}^l$ are the minimum and maximum quantile values for layer $l$, $M_{\text{current}}$ is the current memory usage, and $M_{\text{target}}$ is the target memory budget.

To ensure stability during inference, we incorporate a momentum-based update for the mask:

$$\mathcal{M}_i^l(t) = \lambda \cdot \mathcal{M}_i^l(t-1) + (1-\lambda) \cdot \mathbb{1}[r_i^l > \tau^l(t)]$$

where $\lambda$ is a momentum factor (typically 0.7-0.9).

### 3.3 External Memory Integration

For extremely long contexts, we integrate an external memory system that stores KV pairs for tokens with lower relevance scores. This allows the model to offload less important information to slower but larger memory while keeping the most relevant information in the GPU-accessible KV cache.

We implement a two-tier storage system:
1. **Active Cache**: Contains KV pairs for tokens with high relevance scores, stored in GPU memory
2. **Passive Store**: Contains KV pairs for tokens with lower relevance scores, stored in CPU memory or disk

When a token's relevance score crosses a threshold, we implement a migration policy:

$$\text{if } r_i^l > \tau_{\text{promote}}^l \text{ and } i \in \text{PassiveStore} \Rightarrow \text{move to ActiveCache}$$
$$\text{if } r_i^l < \tau_{\text{demote}}^l \text{ and } i \in \text{ActiveCache} \Rightarrow \text{move to PassiveStore}$$

where $\tau_{\text{promote}}^l$ and $\tau_{\text{demote}}^l$ are the promotion and demotion thresholds for layer $l$.

To ensure efficient retrieval from the passive store, we implement a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme that enables fast approximate retrieval based on semantic similarity:

$$\text{bucket}(k_i^l) = \text{argmin}_{j} \|\text{sgn}(P \cdot k_i^l) - c_j\|_1$$

where $P \in \mathbb{R}^{b \times d_k}$ is a random projection matrix, $k_i^l$ is the key vector for token $i$ at layer $l$, $c_j$ is the centroid of bucket $j$, and $b$ is the hash dimension.

### 3.4 Training Procedure

We train the relevance predictor using a two-phase approach:

1. **Supervised Pretraining**: We generate training data by running the foundation model on benchmark datasets and computing "ground truth" relevance labels based on attention distribution and influence on output probabilities.

2. **Reinforcement Learning Fine-tuning**: We fine-tune the relevance predictor using a policy gradient approach, where the reward function combines model performance and memory efficiency:

$$R = \alpha \cdot \text{Performance} - (1-\alpha) \cdot \text{MemoryUsage}$$

where $\alpha$ balances the trade-off between performance and memory efficiency.

The performance component is measured using task-specific metrics (e.g., perplexity, accuracy), while memory usage is calculated as the proportion of retained KV pairs.

The policy gradient update follows:

$$\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) \cdot R]$$

where $\pi_\theta$ represents the policy defined by the relevance predictor with parameters $\theta$, $a$ represents actions (which tokens to keep), and $s$ represents states (current context and model state).

### 3.5 Experimental Design

To validate the effectiveness of ATSKV, we design comprehensive experiments across multiple dimensions:

1. **Models**: We implement ATSKV on different foundation models, including Llama 2 (7B, 13B, 70B), Mistral (7B), and GPT-3.5/4.

2. **Benchmarks**: We evaluate on long-context understanding benchmarks, including:
   - LongBench v2 (Bai et al., 2025)
   - ∞Bench (Zhang et al., 2024)
   - ZeroSCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2023)
   - RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024)

3. **Metrics**: We measure:
   - Task performance: accuracy, F1, perplexity, ROUGE, etc.
   - Memory efficiency: KV cache size reduction (%)
   - Computational efficiency: throughput (tokens/s), time-to-first-token
   - Scaling behavior: performance vs. context length

4. **Baselines**: We compare against:
   - Full KV cache (no compression)
   - Fixed sliding window approaches
   - DynamicKV (Zhou et al., 2024)
   - MEDA (Wan et al., 2025)
   - RocketKV (Behnam et al., 2025)
   - KVLink (Yang et al., 2025)

5. **Ablation Studies**:
   - Impact of different components of the relevance predictor
   - Effect of varying sparsity levels
   - Contribution of external memory integration
   - Comparison of different threshold adaptation strategies

Each experiment is repeated with 3 different random seeds to ensure statistical significance, and we report means and standard deviations for all metrics.

### 3.6 Implementation Details

Our implementation leverages the following technologies:
- PyTorch for model implementation and training
- CUDA kernels for efficient sparse attention computation
- Hugging Face Transformers for model integration
- Memory-mapped arrays for efficient external memory management

The relevance predictor is implemented as a lightweight module with approximately 100K-500K parameters, adding minimal overhead to the main model. For distributed training and inference, we employ model parallelism to distribute the KV cache across multiple GPUs, with communication optimized for our sparse representation.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### 4.1 Expected Outcomes

The successful implementation of Adaptive Token-Relevance Sparse KV-Cache (ATSKV) is expected to yield several significant outcomes:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: We anticipate achieving an 80-90% reduction in KV cache memory usage compared to the full dense cache while maintaining performance within 1-2% of the baseline across various long-context benchmarks. This substantial memory reduction will enable processing of much longer contexts with the same hardware constraints.

2. **Computational Speedup**: By reducing memory bandwidth requirements and focusing computation on the most relevant tokens, we expect a 2-3x improvement in inference throughput (tokens/second) for generation tasks, particularly for long contexts exceeding 10,000 tokens.

3. **Scalability**: The proposed approach should demonstrate sublinear scaling of memory usage with context length, enabling effective processing of extremely long contexts (100K+ tokens) that are currently infeasible with standard approaches.

4. **Adaptive Performance**: Unlike fixed sparsity patterns, our approach should show adaptive behavior across different tasks and document types, automatically identifying which tokens are most relevant for the specific context and query.

5. **Model-Agnostic Improvements**: We expect the method to provide benefits across different model architectures and sizes, with potentially larger gains for larger models where memory constraints are more severe.

6. **Insights on Token Relevance**: Analysis of the learned relevance patterns should provide valuable insights into how different models utilize context, potentially informing future model designs and training procedures.

### 4.2 Impact

The potential impact of this research extends across several domains:

1. **Democratizing Access to Long-Context Models**: By significantly reducing the memory requirements for long-context processing, ATSKV could enable deployment of these capabilities on more accessible hardware, democratizing access to advanced AI technologies.

2. **Enabling New Applications**: The ability to efficiently process very long contexts opens up new application domains, including:
   - Complete book analysis and summarization
   - Comprehensive medical record processing
   - Long-form creative writing assistance
   - Multi-document reasoning and synthesis

3. **Environmental Benefits**: More efficient inference reduces the energy consumption and carbon footprint associated with AI deployments, contributing to more sustainable AI systems.

4. **Advancing Foundation Model Design**: Insights from this research could influence the design of future foundation models, potentially leading to architectures that are inherently more efficient for long-context processing.

5. **Integration with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: The proposed external memory mechanism provides a natural bridge to RAG systems, potentially leading to hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both paradigms.

6. **Practical Deployment Considerations**: By addressing one of the key bottlenecks in deploying foundation models, this research could accelerate the practical adoption of these technologies in real-world settings.

7. **Scientific Understanding**: The analysis of token relevance patterns could contribute to our scientific understanding of how large language models utilize context, potentially revealing insights about their internal mechanisms.

In conclusion, ATSKV represents a significant step toward making long-context understanding more practical and accessible. By addressing the critical KV cache bottleneck through adaptive, token-level relevance prediction, this approach could substantially expand the practical utility of foundation models across a wide range of applications. The potential to reduce memory requirements by up to 90% while maintaining performance would represent a step-change in the efficiency of long-context processing, enabling new capabilities and applications previously constrained by hardware limitations.
