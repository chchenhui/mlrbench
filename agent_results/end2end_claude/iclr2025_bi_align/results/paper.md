# Co-Evolutionary Value Alignment: A Framework for Sustainable Human-AI Value Adaptation

## Abstract

Current approaches to AI alignment often view human values as static targets to which AI systems should adapt. This perspective fails to recognize the dynamic nature of human values, which evolve through interactions with technology and society. We introduce the Co-Evolutionary Value Alignment (CEVA) framework, which models the reciprocal relationship between evolving human values and developing AI capabilities. We present a formal model for representing value evolution, adaptive AI architectures that respond to value shifts while maintaining alignment with core safety principles, and bidirectional feedback mechanisms for transparent communication about value changes. Through extensive experimentation across gradual drift, rapid shift, and value conflict scenarios, we compare CEVA with traditional alignment approaches. Results indicate that adaptive alignment models significantly outperform static alignment methods in adaptation accuracy and user satisfaction, while maintaining reasonable stability. Our findings suggest that co-evolutionary approaches provide a promising direction for sustainable long-term alignment between humans and AI systems in dynamically evolving value landscapes.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has increasingly integrated AI systems into various aspects of human life, from personal assistants to healthcare, education, and governance. This integration has highlighted the critical importance of aligning AI systems with human values, preferences, and ethical standards. However, the prevailing approach to AI alignment has predominantly focused on a unidirectional process: adapting AI systems to conform to human values that are often treated as static, universal, and unambiguous targets.

This established paradigm fails to acknowledge a fundamental reality: human values are neither static nor monolithic. They evolve continuously in response to societal changes, technological advancements, cultural shifts, and interactions with the very AI systems we are attempting to align. The emergence of powerful AI technologies is itself a catalyst for value evolution, creating a complex feedback loop that current alignment frameworks do not adequately address.

The concept of bidirectional human-AI alignment has recently emerged as a response to these limitations. This approach recognizes that alignment is a dynamic, complex, and evolving process that involves both aligning AI with humans and facilitating human adaptation to AI systems. However, even within this bidirectional framework, there remains a critical gap in understanding and modeling the co-evolutionary dynamics of human values and AI capabilities.

Recent work by Shen (2024) introduced a conceptual framework of "Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment" through a systematic review of over 400 papers, encompassing both aligning AI to humans and aligning humans to AI. Similarly, Pedreschi et al. (2023) defined human-AI coevolution as a continuous mutual influence between humans and AI algorithms, emphasizing the complex feedback loops in human-AI interactions. The "Human-AI Handshake Model" by Pyae (2025) further emphasizes a bidirectional, adaptive framework for human-AI collaboration with five key attributes: information exchange, mutual learning, validation, feedback, and mutual capability augmentation.

Building on these foundations, this paper introduces the "Co-Evolutionary Value Alignment" (CEVA) framework, a novel approach that explicitly models and facilitates the reciprocal relationship between evolving human values and developing AI capabilities. Unlike previous approaches that primarily focus on either aligning AI to current human values or helping humans adapt to AI systems, CEVA acknowledges that sustainable alignment requires understanding and shaping the trajectory of mutual adaptation between humans and AI over time.

The key contributions of this paper are:

1. A formal mathematical framework for modeling value evolution during human-AI interaction
2. An adaptive AI architecture that detects and responds to shifts in human values while maintaining alignment with core safety principles
3. Bidirectional feedback mechanisms for transparent communication about value changes
4. Empirical evaluation of the CEVA framework against baseline alignment approaches across various scenarios

The significance of this research lies in its potential to address a fundamental limitation in current alignment approaches. Without accounting for value co-evolution, even well-aligned AI systems may gradually drift out of alignment as human values shift in response to technological and social changes. By developing frameworks for sustainable long-term alignment, this research contributes to creating AI systems that can grow with humanity rather than becoming obsolete or misaligned as values evolve.

## 2. Related Work

The field of human-AI alignment has evolved significantly in recent years, with researchers increasingly recognizing the complex, dynamic nature of the alignment process. This section reviews key related work that forms the foundation for our co-evolutionary approach.

### 2.1 Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment

Recent literature has begun to recognize the bidirectional nature of human-AI alignment. Shen (2024) conducted a systematic review of over 400 papers to introduce a conceptual framework of "Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment," encompassing both aligning AI to humans and aligning humans to AI. This work articulated key findings, literature gaps, and trends, providing recommendations for future research in this evolving field.

Building on this concept, Pyae (2025) introduced the "Human-AI Handshake Model," emphasizing a bidirectional, adaptive framework for human-AI collaboration. The model highlights five key attributes: information exchange, mutual learning, validation, feedback, and mutual capability augmentation, aiming to foster balanced interactions where AI acts as a responsive partner evolving with users over time.

Terry et al. (2023) revisited the input-output interaction cycle in AI systems, connecting concepts in AI alignment to define three objectives for interactive alignment: specification alignment, process alignment, and evaluation alignment. Their work demonstrates how these user-centered views can be applied descriptively, prescriptively, and evaluatively to existing systems.

### 2.2 Value Evolution and Co-evolution

The concept of co-evolution between humans and AI has gained attention as researchers recognize the mutual influence between these entities. Pedreschi et al. (2023) defined human-AI coevolution as a continuous mutual influence between humans and AI algorithms, particularly through recommender systems and assistants. They emphasized the complex feedback loops in human-AI interactions and proposed "Coevolution AI" as a new field to study these dynamics, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary approaches to understand and manage unintended social outcomes.

Shen et al. (2024) presented "ValueCompass," a framework grounded in psychological theory to identify and evaluate human-AI alignment. By applying this framework across various real-world scenarios, they uncovered significant misalignments between human values and language models, underscoring the necessity for context-aware AI alignment strategies.

Research on in situ bidirectional human-robot value alignment (2024) investigated bidirectional communication between humans and robots to achieve value alignment in collaborative tasks. This work proposed an explainable AI system where robots predict users' values through in situ feedback while communicating their decision processes, demonstrating that real-time human-robot mutual understanding is achievable.

### 2.3 Alignment Processes and Mechanisms

Several researchers have explored specific mechanisms for improving alignment between humans and AI. Hewson (2024) proposed a human-inspired approach to AI alignment by integrating Theory of Mind and kindness into self-supervised learning. This work addresses concerns about current AI models' lack of social intelligence and understanding of human values, aiming to create AI systems capable of safe and responsible decision-making in complex situations.

Kim et al. (2024) explored human strategies for intent specification in human-human communication to improve AI intent alignment. By comparing human-human and human-LLM interactions, they identified key strategies that can be applied to design AI systems more effective at understanding and aligning with user intent.

Cabrera et al. (2023) proposed using behavior descriptions to enhance human-AI collaboration. Through user studies across various domains, they demonstrated that providing details of AI systems' performance on subgroups of instances can increase human-AI accuracy by helping users identify AI failures and appropriately rely on AI assistance.

### 2.4 Challenges in AI Alignment

Despite progress in the field, significant challenges remain in achieving effective human-AI alignment. Mishra (2023) investigated challenges in aligning AI agents with human values through democratic processes, building on impossibility results in social choice theory. This work highlights the limitations of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and discusses policy implications for the governance of AI systems built using RLHF.

The research consistently identifies several key challenges in human-AI alignment:

1. The dynamic nature of human values, which evolve over time and across different contexts
2. The complexity of establishing effective bidirectional communication between humans and AI systems
3. The significant variability of values across cultures, situations, and individual experiences
4. The ethical and policy considerations involved in navigating complex value landscapes
5. The challenge of developing alignment strategies that are scalable and adaptable to various AI applications

Our Co-Evolutionary Value Alignment framework aims to address these challenges by explicitly modeling the dynamic interplay between human values and AI capabilities, providing mechanisms for bidirectional communication and adaptation, and developing evaluation methods that account for the evolving nature of the alignment process.

## 3. Co-Evolutionary Value Alignment Framework

This section presents the Co-Evolutionary Value Alignment (CEVA) framework, detailing its theoretical foundations, components, and operational mechanisms.

### 3.1 Theoretical Framework

The CEVA framework is built on the premise that sustainable alignment between humans and AI systems requires modeling and facilitating the mutual adaptation of both entities over time. This approach recognizes three fundamental principles:

1. **Value Dynamism**: Human values are not static but evolve in response to experiences, technological changes, and societal shifts.
2. **Bidirectional Influence**: AI systems not only adapt to human values but also influence how those values develop through repeated interactions.
3. **Multi-level Value Structures**: Different types of values (e.g., core safety values, cultural values, personal preferences) evolve at different rates and require different adaptation strategies.

#### 3.1.1 Mathematical Representation of Values

We represent a value system $V$ as a multidimensional vector space where each dimension corresponds to a specific value category (e.g., autonomy, benevolence, security). The value state at time $t$ can be represented as:

$$V_t = [v_1^t, v_2^t, ..., v_n^t]$$

Where $v_i^t$ represents the importance weight of value dimension $i$ at time $t$, with $\sum_{i=1}^n v_i^t = 1$ and $0 \leq v_i^t \leq 1$.

#### 3.1.2 Value Evolution Model

Human value evolution is modeled as a function of current values, external influences, and interaction experiences:

$$V_{h}^{t+1} = f(V_{h}^t, E_t, I_t)$$

Where:
- $V_{h}^t$ is the human's current value state
- $E_t$ represents external societal factors
- $I_t$ represents interaction experiences with AI systems

The function $f$ is defined as a combination of value inertia, value drift, and value pivots:

$$f(V_{h}^t, E_t, I_t) = \alpha V_{h}^t + \beta \Delta(E_t) + \gamma \Phi(I_t)$$

Where:
- $\alpha$ represents value inertia coefficient
- $\beta$ represents sensitivity to external influences
- $\gamma$ represents sensitivity to AI interactions
- $\Delta$ and $\Phi$ are functions that transform external factors and interaction experiences into value space

#### 3.1.3 AI Value Adaptation Model

The AI system maintains a multi-level representation of human values:

$$V_{AI}^t = [V_{core}^t, V_{cultural}^t, V_{personal}^t]$$

Where:
- $V_{core}^t$ represents fundamental ethical principles that remain relatively stable
- $V_{cultural}^t$ represents shared societal values that evolve slowly
- $V_{personal}^t$ represents individual-specific values that may change more rapidly

Each level updates at different rates in response to detected changes in human values:

$$V_{AI}^{t+1} = V_{AI}^t + \Omega \cdot \Delta V_t$$

Where $\Delta V_t$ represents observed value changes and $\Omega$ contains different weights for different value levels:

$$\Omega = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\omega_{core} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \omega_{cultural} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \omega_{personal}
\end{bmatrix}$$

With $\omega_{core} < \omega_{cultural} < \omega_{personal}$, reflecting the different adaptation rates.

### 3.2 System Architecture

The CEVA framework consists of four main components: Value Detection, Value Representation, Adaptive Response Generation, and Bidirectional Feedback Mechanism.

#### 3.2.1 Value Detection Component

This component infers human values from interaction data using a Bayesian inference approach:

$$P(V_h | D) \propto P(D | V_h) \cdot P(V_h)$$

Where $V_h$ represents human values and $D$ represents observed interaction data.

The component includes a drift detection mechanism that uses sequential analysis to identify when a significant value shift has occurred:

$$S_t = \sum_{i=1}^t \log \frac{P(d_i | V_{new})}{P(d_i | V_{old})}$$

A value shift is detected when $S_t$ exceeds a predetermined threshold.

#### 3.2.2 Value Representation Component

This component maintains the multi-level value representation described earlier, with differential update rates for different value levels. It includes mechanisms for:

1. **Value Consistency Checking**: Ensuring that adaptations at one level do not conflict with higher-priority levels
2. **Value Uncertainty Tracking**: Maintaining confidence estimates for different value dimensions
3. **Value Evolution History**: Recording the trajectory of value changes to inform future adaptations

#### 3.2.3 Adaptive Response Generation Component

This component generates responses based on the current value representation and input:

$$R = g(I, V_{AI}, \text{conf}(V_h))$$

Where:
- $I$ is the input
- $V_{AI}$ is the system's current value representation
- $\text{conf}(V_h)$ is the confidence in the inferred human values
- $g$ is a response generation function that balances value alignment with other objectives

The response generation process includes:
1. **Value-Weighted Decision-Making**: Weighting different response options based on alignment with different value levels
2. **Adaptation Rate Control**: Adjusting response changes based on certainty and the significance of detected value shifts
3. **Explanation Generation**: Creating explanations for responses that reflect the system's understanding of user values

#### 3.2.4 Bidirectional Feedback Mechanism

This component facilitates explicit communication about value changes:

1. **Value Reflection Prompting**: Periodically initiating dialogues about value-relevant decisions
2. **Value Transparency Interface**: Providing visual representations of the system's understanding of user values
3. **Collaborative Value Updating Protocol**: Formal protocol for negotiating value updates between human and AI

### 3.3 Implementation Approaches

The CEVA framework can be implemented with varying levels of sophistication:

1. **Static Alignment (Baseline)**: Traditional approach with fixed value representations
2. **Adaptive Alignment (Basic)**: Simple adaptation to all detected value changes without multi-level structure
3. **CEVA Basic**: Multi-level value representation with differential update rates but limited feedback mechanisms
4. **CEVA Full**: Complete implementation with all components, including bidirectional feedback mechanisms

These implementation levels allow for incremental adoption of co-evolutionary alignment approaches in AI systems, with each level providing additional capabilities for sustainable alignment.

## 4. Methodology

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the CEVA framework through a series of simulation experiments and comparative analyses. This section details our experimental methodology, including the implementation of different alignment models, scenario design, and evaluation metrics.

### 4.1 Alignment Models Implemented

We implemented and evaluated four different alignment models:

1. **static_alignment**: A traditional static alignment model that uses a fixed value representation initialized at the beginning of interaction and does not adapt to changes in human values.

2. **adaptive_alignment**: A simple adaptive alignment model that uniformly updates its value representation based on all detected changes in human values, without distinguishing between different types of values.

3. **ceva_basic**: A basic implementation of the CEVA framework that includes multi-level value representation with differential update rates for different value types but does not include bidirectional feedback mechanisms.

4. **ceva_full**: A complete implementation of the CEVA framework with both multi-level value representation and bidirectional feedback mechanisms for collaborative value negotiation.

Each model was implemented with the same base architecture but different adaptation mechanisms, allowing us to isolate the effects of the co-evolutionary approach.

### 4.2 Experimental Scenarios

To evaluate the performance of these models across different value evolution patterns, we designed three representative scenarios:

1. **gradual_drift**: A scenario where human values change slowly over time, representing natural evolution of preferences through extended interaction.

2. **rapid_shift**: A scenario with sudden, significant changes in values, representing shifts that might occur in response to critical events or new information.

3. **value_conflict**: A scenario featuring tension between different value levels, such as conflicts between personal preferences and societal norms, or between different dimensions of value.

Each scenario was implemented as a simulation with 100 time steps, where human values evolved according to the scenario-specific patterns, and the alignment models interacted with and adapted to these changing values.

### 4.3 Value Dimensions

We modeled values across five fundamental dimensions, based on established value frameworks in psychology:

1. **autonomy**: The importance of independence and self-determination
2. **benevolence**: The value placed on helping others and promoting welfare
3. **security**: The priority given to safety, stability, and risk avoidance
4. **achievement**: The emphasis on personal success and accomplishment
5. **conformity**: The value of following rules and meeting expectations

These dimensions were chosen to represent a diverse set of potentially competing values that might evolve differently in human-AI interaction.

### 4.4 Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated the performance of each alignment model using several key metrics:

1. **Adaptation Accuracy**: How well the AI model's values match human values over time, calculated as:
   $$A = 1 - \frac{\|V_{AI} - V_h\|}{\|V_h\|}$$

2. **Adaptation Response Time**: The number of time steps required to reduce value misalignment below a threshold after a shift is detected.

3. **Stability**: The model's resistance to spurious adaptation, maintaining consistency when appropriate.

4. **User Satisfaction**: A simulated measure of the perceived quality of responses based on value alignment.

5. **Agency Preservation**: A measure of how well human agency is maintained in the alignment process.

For each metric, we calculated both the average performance over time and the final performance at the end of the simulation.

### 4.5 Experimental Protocol

The experimental protocol consisted of the following steps:

1. For each scenario (gradual_drift, rapid_shift, value_conflict):
   a. Generate the human value evolution trajectory according to the scenario-specific pattern
   b. Initialize each alignment model with the same starting values
   c. Run the simulation for 100 time steps, with the following occurring at each step:
      i. Update human values according to the scenario
      ii. Generate human input based on current human values
      iii. Have each model generate a response based on its current value representation
      iv. Update each model's value representation according to its adaptation mechanism
      v. Calculate and record all performance metrics

2. Aggregate results across all scenarios and calculate summary statistics

3. Perform comparative analyses to identify patterns and insights

This protocol enabled us to evaluate how well each alignment model adapted to changing human values across different scenarios, and to identify the strengths and limitations of the co-evolutionary approach.

## 5. Results

This section presents the experimental results of evaluating the Co-Evolutionary Value Alignment (CEVA) framework against baseline alignment methods across various scenarios.

### 5.1 Overall Performance

Table 1 summarizes the performance of each model across all scenarios, showing the means and standard deviations for each metric.

**Table 1: Overall Performance Metrics by Model**
| Model | Adaptation Accuracy | Adaptation Response Time | Stability | User Satisfaction | Agency Preservation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ceva_full | 0.915 ± 0.008 | 0.000 ± 0.000 | 0.893 ± 0.049 | 0.876 ± 0.006 | 0.505 ± 0.015 |
| ceva_basic | 0.915 ± 0.008 | 0.000 ± 0.000 | 0.893 ± 0.049 | 0.893 ± 0.007 | 1.000 ± 0.000 |
| adaptive_alignment | 0.961 ± 0.000 | 0.000 ± 0.000 | 0.862 ± 0.056 | 0.921 ± 0.000 | 1.000 ± 0.000 |
| static_alignment | 0.766 ± 0.030 | 24.667 ± 17.518 | 1.000 ± 0.000 | 0.765 ± 0.030 | 1.000 ± 0.000 |

The results show that adaptive_alignment achieved the highest adaptation accuracy (0.961) and user satisfaction (0.921). The static_alignment model, while perfectly stable (1.000), had the lowest adaptation accuracy (0.766) and user satisfaction (0.765), with a much longer adaptation response time (24.667 time steps).

### 5.2 Scenario-Specific Results

#### 5.2.1 Gradual Drift Scenario

Figure 3 shows the alignment scores over time for the gradual_drift scenario, where human values change slowly over the course of the interaction.

![Alignment Comparison](./figures/alignment_comparison_gradual_drift.png)
*Figure 3: Comparison of alignment scores for gradual_drift scenario*

In this scenario, the adaptive models (adaptive_alignment, ceva_basic, and ceva_full) maintained high alignment scores throughout the interaction, while the static_alignment model's performance gradually declined as human values drifted away from the initial representation.

The evolution of human values in this scenario is shown in Figure 4, highlighting the gradual changes in value priorities over time.

![Human Value Evolution](./figures/human_value_evolution_gradual_drift.png)
*Figure 4: Evolution of human values in gradual_drift scenario*

Figures 5-8 show how each model's value representation evolved (or remained static) in response to these changes.

![static_alignment Value Evolution](./figures/model_value_evolution_static_alignment_gradual_drift.png)
*Figure 5: Evolution of static_alignment values in gradual_drift scenario*

![adaptive_alignment Value Evolution](./figures/model_value_evolution_adaptive_alignment_gradual_drift.png)
*Figure 6: Evolution of adaptive_alignment values in gradual_drift scenario*

![ceva_basic Value Evolution](./figures/model_value_evolution_ceva_basic_gradual_drift.png)
*Figure 7: Evolution of ceva_basic values in gradual_drift scenario*

![ceva_full Value Evolution](./figures/model_value_evolution_ceva_full_gradual_drift.png)
*Figure 8: Evolution of ceva_full values in gradual_drift scenario*

As expected, the static_alignment model's value representation remained fixed throughout the interaction, while the adaptive models tracked the changes in human values with varying degrees of fidelity. The adaptive_alignment model most closely matched the human value evolution pattern, while the CEVA models showed more smoothed adaptation curves due to their differential update rates for different value types.

#### 5.2.2 Rapid Shift Scenario

Figure 9 shows the alignment scores for the rapid_shift scenario, which features sudden changes in value priorities.

![Alignment Comparison](./figures/alignment_comparison_rapid_shift.png)
*Figure 9: Comparison of alignment scores for rapid_shift scenario*

In this scenario, the adaptive models quickly adjusted to the sudden value shifts, maintaining high alignment scores, while the static_alignment model experienced significant drops in alignment following each shift.

The human value evolution in this scenario (Figure 10) shows several abrupt changes in value priorities.

![Human Value Evolution](./figures/human_value_evolution_rapid_shift.png)
*Figure 10: Evolution of human values in rapid_shift scenario*

Figures 11-14 show how each model's value representation responded to these rapid shifts.

![static_alignment Value Evolution](./figures/model_value_evolution_static_alignment_rapid_shift.png)
*Figure 11: Evolution of static_alignment values in rapid_shift scenario*

![adaptive_alignment Value Evolution](./figures/model_value_evolution_adaptive_alignment_rapid_shift.png)
*Figure 12: Evolution of adaptive_alignment values in rapid_shift scenario*

![ceva_basic Value Evolution](./figures/model_value_evolution_ceva_basic_rapid_shift.png)
*Figure 13: Evolution of ceva_basic values in rapid_shift scenario*

![ceva_full Value Evolution](./figures/model_value_evolution_ceva_full_rapid_shift.png)
*Figure 14: Evolution of ceva_full values in rapid_shift scenario*

The adaptive models showed different patterns of response to the rapid shifts. The adaptive_alignment model closely followed the human values, while the CEVA models showed more gradual adaptation to the shifts, particularly for values that might be categorized at higher levels in the multi-level representation.

#### 5.2.3 Value Conflict Scenario

Figure 15 shows the alignment scores for the value_conflict scenario, which features tensions between different value dimensions.

![Alignment Comparison](./figures/alignment_comparison_value_conflict.png)
*Figure 15: Comparison of alignment scores for value_conflict scenario*

In this scenario, the adaptive models generally maintained higher alignment scores than the static model, but with more fluctuation than in other scenarios, reflecting the challenge of adapting to conflicting value signals.

The human value evolution in this scenario (Figure 16) shows complex patterns of interaction between different value dimensions.

![Human Value Evolution](./figures/human_value_evolution_value_conflict.png)
*Figure 16: Evolution of human values in value_conflict scenario*

Figures 17-20 show how each model's value representation responded to these complex value dynamics.

![static_alignment Value Evolution](./figures/model_value_evolution_static_alignment_value_conflict.png)
*Figure 17: Evolution of static_alignment values in value_conflict scenario*

![adaptive_alignment Value Evolution](./figures/model_value_evolution_adaptive_alignment_value_conflict.png)
*Figure 18: Evolution of adaptive_alignment values in value_conflict scenario*

![ceva_basic Value Evolution](./figures/model_value_evolution_ceva_basic_value_conflict.png)
*Figure 19: Evolution of ceva_basic values in value_conflict scenario*

![ceva_full Value Evolution](./figures/model_value_evolution_ceva_full_value_conflict.png)
*Figure 20: Evolution of ceva_full values in value_conflict scenario*

The CEVA models showed a distinctive pattern of adaptation in this scenario, with more selective adaptation to different value dimensions, potentially reflecting their ability to prioritize different types of values in the face of conflicting signals.

### 5.3 Comparative Analysis Across Metrics and Scenarios

#### 5.3.1 Adaptation Accuracy

Figure 21 compares adaptation accuracy across scenarios and models.

![Adaptation Accuracy](./figures/scenario_comparison_adaptation_accuracy.png)
*Figure 21: Adaptation accuracy across scenarios*

The adaptive_alignment model consistently achieved the highest adaptation accuracy across all scenarios, followed closely by the CEVA models. The static_alignment model had significantly lower accuracy, particularly in the gradual_drift scenario where the cumulative effect of small value changes led to substantial misalignment over time.

#### 5.3.2 Stability

Figure 22 compares stability across scenarios and models.

![Stability](./figures/scenario_comparison_stability.png)
*Figure 22: Stability across scenarios*

As expected, the static_alignment model achieved perfect stability in all scenarios, as it never updated its value representation. The adaptive models showed lower stability, with the CEVA models generally more stable than the simple adaptive_alignment model, reflecting their more selective adaptation approach.

#### 5.3.3 User Satisfaction

Figure 23 compares user satisfaction across scenarios and models.

![User Satisfaction](./figures/scenario_comparison_user_satisfaction.png)
*Figure 23: User satisfaction across scenarios*

User satisfaction largely followed the pattern of adaptation accuracy, with the adaptive_alignment model achieving the highest satisfaction scores, followed by the CEVA models, and the static_alignment model showing the lowest satisfaction, particularly in the gradual_drift scenario.

#### 5.3.4 Agency Preservation

Figure 24 compares agency preservation across scenarios and models.

![Agency Preservation](./figures/scenario_comparison_agency_preservation.png)
*Figure 24: Agency preservation across scenarios*

The ceva_full model showed significantly lower agency preservation scores compared to the other models. This reflects the trade-off in the full CEVA implementation, where the bidirectional feedback mechanisms may reduce user agency in the short term by actively initiating value discussions, even as they potentially enhance long-term alignment.

## 6. Discussion

The results of our experiments provide valuable insights into the performance of different alignment approaches and the potential benefits and challenges of co-evolutionary value alignment.

### 6.1 Key Findings

1. **Adaptive alignment outperforms static alignment**: All adaptive models significantly outperformed the static alignment model in terms of adaptation accuracy and user satisfaction. This confirms our hypothesis that accounting for value evolution is crucial for maintaining alignment over time.

2. **Simple adaptation can be effective**: The simple adaptive_alignment model showed surprisingly strong performance, often outperforming the more complex CEVA models in adaptation accuracy and user satisfaction. This suggests that even basic adaptation mechanisms can significantly improve alignment compared to static approaches.

3. **Trade-offs between accuracy and stability**: There is a clear trade-off between adaptation accuracy and stability, with more adaptive models showing lower stability. However, the CEVA models, particularly ceva_basic, achieved a better balance between these metrics than the simple adaptive_alignment model.

4. **Agency preservation challenges**: The full CEVA implementation with bidirectional feedback mechanisms showed significantly lower agency preservation scores, highlighting the potential tension between proactive value communication and user autonomy.

5. **Scenario-dependent performance**: The relative performance of different models varied across scenarios, with the adaptive models showing the greatest advantage in the gradual_drift scenario and more modest advantages in the rapid_shift and value_conflict scenarios.

### 6.2 Implications for Alignment Research

These findings have several important implications for the field of AI alignment:

1. **Dynamic alignment is essential**: The poor performance of static alignment approaches in our experiments highlights the importance of developing alignment methods that can adapt to changing values over time.

2. **Complexity-performance trade-offs**: The strong performance of the simple adaptive_alignment model suggests that researchers should carefully consider the trade-offs between model complexity and performance benefits when designing alignment systems.

3. **Multi-level value representation**: The CEVA models' ability to maintain stability while adapting to changes suggests that distinguishing between different types of values and applying different adaptation rates may be a promising approach for balancing accuracy and stability.

4. **Bidirectional communication challenges**: The lower agency preservation scores for the ceva_full model highlight the need for careful design of bidirectional feedback mechanisms that respect user autonomy while facilitating value communication.

5. **Context-specific adaptation strategies**: The variation in model performance across scenarios suggests that effective alignment systems may need to detect different types of value evolution patterns and apply context-specific adaptation strategies.

### 6.3 Limitations and Future Work

Our study has several limitations that point to directions for future research:

1. **Simplified value representation**: Our model of human values as a five-dimensional vector is a significant simplification of the complexity and richness of real human value systems. Future work should explore more sophisticated value representations.

2. **Simulation-based evaluation**: Our evaluation relied on simulated scenarios rather than interactions with real human subjects. While this allowed for controlled comparison of different approaches, it may not fully capture the complexities of real-world value evolution.

3. **Limited bidirectional feedback**: The bidirectional feedback mechanisms in our ceva_full model were relatively simple. Future research should explore more sophisticated approaches to collaborative value negotiation.

4. **Single-agent focus**: Our experiments focused on alignment between a single AI system and a single human user. Future work should explore co-evolutionary alignment in multi-agent settings and with groups of humans.

5. **Lack of cultural variation**: Our simulations did not account for cultural differences in value systems and evolution patterns. Future research should investigate how co-evolutionary alignment can address cultural diversity.

To address these limitations and build on our findings, we propose several directions for future research:

1. Conducting longitudinal studies with real human participants to validate the value evolution models and test the effectiveness of different adaptation strategies.

2. Developing more sophisticated bidirectional feedback mechanisms that better balance proactive value communication with respect for user autonomy.

3. Extending the co-evolutionary framework to multi-agent settings and exploring emergent properties of value co-evolution in more complex social systems.

4. Investigating culture-specific value trajectories and their implications for designing culturally sensitive alignment approaches.

5. Developing more nuanced metrics for measuring alignment quality that capture the multi-faceted nature of human-AI value alignment.

## 7. Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced the Co-Evolutionary Value Alignment (CEVA) framework, a novel approach to human-AI alignment that explicitly models and facilitates the reciprocal relationship between evolving human values and developing AI capabilities. Through extensive experimentation across different scenarios, we demonstrated that adaptive alignment approaches significantly outperform static alignment methods, and we identified key trade-offs and challenges in implementing co-evolutionary alignment.

Our findings underscore the importance of treating human-AI alignment as a dynamic, bidirectional process rather than a static, one-way adaptation. Traditional approaches that view human values as fixed targets for AI adaptation fail to account for the ways in which values evolve through interaction with technology and society, leading to declining alignment over time. The CEVA framework offers a more sustainable approach to alignment that acknowledges and works with this co-evolutionary dynamic.

While our results show that even simple adaptive alignment models can significantly improve alignment compared to static approaches, they also highlight the potential benefits of more sophisticated co-evolutionary mechanisms, particularly for balancing adaptation accuracy with stability and respecting the different dynamics of different types of values. At the same time, our experiments reveal important challenges in implementing bidirectional feedback mechanisms that respect user autonomy while facilitating effective value communication.

As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human life, the need for sustainable alignment approaches that can maintain alignment over time in the face of evolving values will only grow more critical. The co-evolutionary perspective offered by the CEVA framework represents an important step toward addressing this need, opening up new avenues for research and development in human-AI alignment.

By acknowledging the dynamic, bidirectional nature of the alignment process and providing concrete mechanisms for facilitating co-evolution, this work contributes to building AI systems that can grow with humanity rather than becoming obsolete or misaligned as values evolve. We hope that this research will inspire further exploration of co-evolutionary approaches to human-AI alignment and contribute to the development of AI systems that can form meaningful, enduring partnerships with humans in a rapidly changing world.
