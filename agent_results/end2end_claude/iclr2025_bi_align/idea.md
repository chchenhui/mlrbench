# Human-AI Value Co-Evolution Framework

## Motivation
Current approaches to AI alignment often view human values as static targets that AI systems should adapt to. However, human values themselves evolve through interactions with technology and society. This research addresses a critical gap in bidirectional alignment: how human values and AI capabilities can co-evolve in a mutually beneficial way, rather than pursuing a one-sided adaptation of AI to current human values or vice versa. Without addressing this dynamic interplay, we risk creating systems that quickly become misaligned as human values shift in response to AI's societal integration.

## Main Idea
I propose a framework for Human-AI Value Co-Evolution that models the reciprocal relationship between evolving human values and developing AI capabilities. The approach combines longitudinal studies of value shifts in human-AI interaction with adaptive AI architectures that can detect and respond to these shifts. The methodology involves: (1) creating explicit value representation models that capture not just current values but their trajectory and variability across cultures; (2) developing feedback mechanisms where both humans and AI systems can reflect on and communicate about value changes; and (3) implementing differential updating rates where critical safety-aligned values remain more stable while preference-based values can adapt more fluidly. The framework would provide insights into sustainable long-term alignment strategies and practical guidelines for developing AI systems that grow with humanity rather than becoming obsolete or misaligned as values evolve.
