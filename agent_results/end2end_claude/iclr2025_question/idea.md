# Reasoning Uncertainty Networks: Enhancing LLM Transparency Through Graph-Based Belief Propagation

## Motivation
Large language models frequently generate hallucinations that appear factual due to their inability to transparently represent uncertainty. Current approaches like calibration or ensemble methods treat uncertainty as a post-hoc calculation rather than an integral part of the reasoning process. This research addresses the fundamental challenge of making uncertainty explicit throughout a model's reasoning chain, enabling systems to flag potential hallucinations and communicate confidence levels to users in high-stakes domains where reliability is critical.

## Main Idea
We propose "Reasoning Uncertainty Networks" (RUNs), a graph-based approach that represents LLM reasoning as a directed graph where nodes are factual assertions and edges represent logical dependencies. Each node carries an explicit uncertainty distribution based on both its own evidence and propagated uncertainty from dependent nodes. The system uses belief propagation algorithms to continuously update confidence levels as reasoning progresses, automatically flagging potential hallucination points when uncertainty exceeds thresholds. By representing reasoning as an inspectable graph with quantified uncertainty at each step, RUNs provide transparency into how confidence flows through complex reasoning chains. The approach is computationally efficient as it operates on the semantic level rather than requiring multiple forward passes, and offers powerful explainability benefits by allowing users to identify precisely where reasoning uncertainty originates, making it particularly valuable for legal, medical, and scientific applications.
