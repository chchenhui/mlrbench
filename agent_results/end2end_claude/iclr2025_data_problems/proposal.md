# Attribution-Guided Training: Enhancing Foundation Model Transparency and Copyright Compliance Through Embedded Attribution Mechanisms

## 1. Introduction

Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized machine learning by demonstrating remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. These models are trained on massive datasets often containing billions of examples, including text, images, and other modalities. While this scale contributes to their impressive performance, it also introduces significant challenges related to data attribution, copyright compliance, and transparency.

Current foundation models frequently generate content that closely resembles training examples without providing proper attribution or acknowledgment to original creators. This issue has led to increasing concerns about copyright infringement, lack of transparency, and ethical implications in AI-generated content. As Dornis and Stober (2025) highlight, many current FM training practices may not align with "fair use" doctrines, especially given models' tendency to memorize and reproduce copyrighted content.

Existing approaches to data attribution are predominantly retroactive, applied only after a model has been trained, making them inefficient and often impractical for identifying potential copyright violations during the training process. Henderson et al. (2023) emphasize that fair use is not guaranteed when training foundation models on copyrighted material, highlighting the need for technical mitigations that align model development with legal frameworks. Additionally, Franceschelli et al. (2024) suggest that model weights could be considered reproductions of copyrighted works, further complicating the legal landscape.

Traditional attribution methods like influence functions (Mlodozeniec et al., 2024) and Data Shapley (Wang et al., 2024) provide valuable insights but face significant challenges when scaled to foundation models due to their computational intensity and post-hoc nature. These limitations underscore the need for novel approaches that integrate attribution directly into the training process.

This research proposes Attribution-Guided Training (AGT), a novel framework that embeds attribution signals during foundation model training rather than applying them post-hoc. By incorporating attribution mechanisms directly into the training pipeline, AGT aims to address key challenges in transparency, copyright compliance, and ethical AI development. The framework utilizes a dual-objective optimization approach that balances predictive performance with attribution accuracy, creating models that can automatically cite sources based on activation patterns during inference.

The significance of this research extends across multiple dimensions:

1. **Legal and Ethical Compliance**: AGT provides a technical foundation for addressing copyright concerns raised by researchers like Dornis and Stober (2025) and Henderson et al. (2023), potentially establishing new standards for responsible AI development.

2. **Transparency and Accountability**: By enabling automatic attribution during generation, AGT enhances model transparency, addressing the interpretability challenges highlighted by Chen et al. (2025).

3. **Technical Innovation**: The proposed framework advances the field by integrating attribution into the training process itself, offering an alternative to computationally intensive post-hoc methods discussed by Wang et al. (2024).

4. **Practical Applications**: AGT could benefit content creators, model developers, and end-users by establishing clear provenance for AI-generated content, addressing the genericization concerns raised by Chiba-Okabe and Su (2024).

Through this research, we aim to bridge the gap between state-of-the-art foundation model capabilities and the growing need for attribution, transparency, and copyright compliance in AI systems.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Overview of Attribution-Guided Training (AGT)

The Attribution-Guided Training framework consists of three key components:

1. **Dual-Objective Optimization**: Balancing conventional training loss with attribution loss
2. **Attribution Network**: A parallel network that maps model activations to source documents
3. **Attribution-aware Generation**: Mechanisms for automatic citation during inference

The core innovation of AGT lies in embedding attribution signals during foundation model training rather than applying attribution methods post-hoc. This approach creates models that inherently track and represent the provenance of information.

### 2.2 Formal Definition and Mathematical Framework

Let $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)\}$ represent the training dataset, where each $(x_i, y_i)$ pair corresponds to an input-output example. Each example has an associated source identifier $s_i$ that represents its origin (e.g., document ID, creator information).

The foundation model $f_\theta$ with parameters $\theta$ produces representations at each layer $l$ denoted as $h^l(x)$. We introduce an attribution network $g_\phi$ with parameters $\phi$ that takes these representations and predicts the source of the input:

$$g_\phi(h^l(x_i)) \approx s_i$$

The traditional training objective for foundation models typically minimizes a loss function $\mathcal{L}_{pred}$ that measures the discrepancy between model predictions and ground truth:

$$\mathcal{L}_{pred}(\theta) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \ell(f_\theta(x_i), y_i)$$

where $\ell$ is a task-specific loss function (e.g., cross-entropy for classification).

The AGT framework introduces an additional attribution loss that encourages the model to encode source information in its internal representations:

$$\mathcal{L}_{attr}(\theta, \phi) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} d(g_\phi(h^l(x_i)), s_i)$$

where $d$ is a distance function measuring how accurately the attribution network identifies the source. This could be implemented as cross-entropy loss for categorical source identifiers or other appropriate metrics depending on how sources are represented.

The complete AGT objective function combines these losses with a weighting parameter $\lambda$ that controls the trade-off between predictive performance and attribution:

$$\mathcal{L}_{AGT}(\theta, \phi) = \mathcal{L}_{pred}(\theta) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{attr}(\theta, \phi)$$

During optimization, we update both the foundation model parameters $\theta$ and the attribution network parameters $\phi$:

$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \alpha \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{AGT}(\theta_t, \phi_t)$$
$$\phi_{t+1} = \phi_t - \beta \nabla_\phi \mathcal{L}_{attr}(\theta_t, \phi_t)$$

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are learning rates for the respective networks.

### 2.3 Attribution Network Architecture

The attribution network $g_\phi$ maps from the foundation model's internal representations to source identifiers. We propose multiple design options for this network:

1. **Layer-specific Attribution**: Dedicated attribution networks for specific layers of the foundation model, targeting layers that are known to capture different levels of abstraction.

$$g_\phi^l(h^l(x)) \approx s$$

2. **Multi-layer Attribution**: Combining information from multiple layers to make more robust attribution predictions.

$$g_\phi([h^{l_1}(x); h^{l_2}(x); ...; h^{l_k}(x)]) \approx s$$

where $[;]$ denotes concatenation and $l_1, l_2, ..., l_k$ are selected layers.

3. **Attention-based Attribution**: Using attention mechanisms to dynamically weight the importance of different representation components for attribution.

$$g_\phi(Attention(h^{l_1}(x), h^{l_2}(x), ..., h^{l_k}(x))) \approx s$$

For large-scale implementation, we propose a lightweight attribution network architecture to minimize computational overhead. The attribution network can be implemented as a shallow MLP or transformer, depending on the complexity of the attribution task and the size of the source space.

### 2.4 Attribution-Aware Generation

During inference or generation, the model should provide attribution information for its outputs. We propose two approaches:

1. **Threshold-based Attribution**: When generating content, the model computes attribution scores for each generated segment (e.g., sentence or paragraph) using the attribution network. If the score exceeds a predefined threshold $\tau$, the model includes a citation to the source:

$$\text{If } \max_{s \in \mathcal{S}} p(s|h^l(x_{gen})) > \tau \text{, then cite source } \arg\max_{s \in \mathcal{S}} p(s|h^l(x_{gen}))$$

where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all sources and $x_{gen}$ is the generated content.

2. **Top-k Attribution**: For each generated segment, the model provides the top-k most likely sources along with confidence scores:

$$\text{Cite sources } \text{TopK}_{s \in \mathcal{S}} p(s|h^l(x_{gen}))$$

To implement these approaches efficiently, we maintain an index of source identifiers that can be quickly matched against attribution predictions during inference.

### 2.5 Data Collection and Preparation

To implement and evaluate AGT, we will use the following data:

1. **Training Dataset**: A diverse corpus with clear provenance information, including:
   - Public domain texts (e.g., Project Gutenberg)
   - Licensed content with permission (e.g., through partnerships with content providers)
   - Academic publications with proper licensing
   - Creative Commons licensed materials

2. **Source Annotation**: Each training example will be annotated with:
   - Source identifier (unique ID for each source document)
   - Creator information (author, publisher)
   - License information
   - Publication date

3. **Test Datasets**:
   - In-distribution test sets with known sources
   - Out-of-distribution test sets to evaluate generalization
   - Adversarial test sets designed to challenge the attribution mechanism

### 2.6 Experimental Design

We will evaluate AGT through comprehensive experiments designed to answer the following questions:

1. **Attribution Accuracy**: How accurately does AGT attribute generated content to its sources?
2. **Performance Trade-offs**: What is the impact of attribution mechanisms on model performance?
3. **Generalization**: Does AGT generalize to unseen data and novel generation tasks?
4. **Scalability**: How does AGT scale with model size and dataset size?

#### Experiment 1: Attribution Accuracy Evaluation

We will assess attribution accuracy using both automatic and human evaluation:

- **Automatic Evaluation**: 
  - Precision, recall, and F1 score for source prediction
  - Mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of correct source in attribution predictions
  - Area under the ROC curve (AUC) for binary attribution decisions

- **Human Evaluation**:
  - Expert evaluators will assess the correctness of attributions
  - Blind comparison of AGT versus baseline attribution methods

#### Experiment 2: Performance Comparison

We will compare AGT against the following baselines:

1. Standard foundation model without attribution mechanisms
2. Post-hoc attribution methods including:
   - Influence functions (Mlodozeniec et al., 2024)
   - Data Shapley (Wang et al., 2024)
   - Minimal interpretable subset selection (Chen et al., 2025)

Metrics for comparison will include:
- Standard task performance metrics (e.g., perplexity, BLEU score)
- Computational overhead (training time, inference time)
- Memory requirements

#### Experiment 3: Ablation Studies

We will conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components:

1. Varying the attribution loss weight $\lambda$
2. Testing different attribution network architectures
3. Comparing layer-specific versus multi-layer attribution approaches
4. Evaluating different thresholds for attribution during generation

#### Experiment 4: Generalization Assessment

We will test the model's ability to:
- Attribute content from different domains
- Handle paraphrases and stylistic variations of source content
- Recognize when generated content should not be attributed (novel generation)

#### Experiment 5: Scaling Behavior

We will investigate how attribution performance scales with:
- Model size (from small to large foundation models)
- Dataset size (from thousands to millions of examples)
- Source space size (from hundreds to thousands of sources)

### 2.7 Evaluation Metrics

In addition to the metrics mentioned in the experimental design, we will develop specialized metrics for attribution quality:

1. **Attribution Precision Score (APS)**:
   $$APS = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{|\text{Correct Attributions in }x_i|}{|\text{Total Attributions in }x_i|}$$

2. **Attribution Recall Score (ARS)**:
   $$ARS = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{|\text{Correct Attributions in }x_i|}{|\text{Required Attributions in }x_i|}$$

3. **Attribution F1 Score (AF1)**:
   $$AF1 = \frac{2 \times APS \times ARS}{APS + ARS}$$

4. **Content Originality Score (COS)**: Following Chiba-Okabe and Su (2024), we will implement a metric to quantify how much generated content is novel versus derived from sources:
   $$COS = 1 - \frac{|\text{Content Requiring Attribution}|}{|\text{Total Generated Content}|}$$

5. **Attribution Efficiency (AE)**: Measuring computational overhead relative to attribution quality:
   $$AE = \frac{AF1}{\text{Relative Computational Cost}}$$

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### 3.1 Technical Outcomes

The successful implementation of Attribution-Guided Training is expected to yield several significant technical outcomes:
