**Key Challenges:**

1. **Error Propagation in Training**: Incorporating incorrect code examples during fine-tuning can inadvertently reinforce erroneous patterns, leading to models that generate faulty code.

2. **Scalability of Formal Verification Integration**: Integrating formal verification tools with large language models poses scalability challenges, as verification processes can be computationally intensive and may not scale efficiently with large datasets.

3. **Balancing Model Creativity and Correctness**: Ensuring that models generate functionally correct code without stifling their creative problem-solving abilities remains a significant challenge.

4. **Automated Error Explanation Generation**: Developing systems that can automatically generate accurate and comprehensible natural language explanations for code errors is complex and requires sophisticated natural language understanding.
