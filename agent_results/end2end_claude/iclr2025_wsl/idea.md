# Neural Weight Archeology: Decoding Model Behaviors from Weight Patterns

## Motivation
With millions of pre-trained models available, understanding what capabilities and biases are encoded in their weights remains a critical challenge. Current approaches to model analysis rely heavily on input-output behavior testing, which is computationally expensive and often incomplete. Direct analysis of weight patterns could reveal model properties more efficiently, enabling better model selection, identifying potential risks, and understanding how models encode knowledge. This research addresses the need for techniques that can "read" neural weights as an information-rich data modality.

## Main Idea
We propose developing a weight pattern analyzer that treats neural networks as archeological artifacts, extracting insights directly from weight structures without requiring inference runs. Our method combines graph neural networks to capture weight connectivity patterns with attention mechanisms to identify important weight clusters. The system will be trained to predict model properties (e.g., training data characteristics, generalization ability, vulnerability to specific attacks) from weights alone. We'll create a standardized benchmark of labeled models with known properties to train our system. The expected outcome is a tool that can efficiently screen models for desired capabilities or hidden risks, trace model lineage, and potentially guide model editing operations. This could dramatically accelerate model auditing processes and enhance our theoretical understanding of how neural networks encode knowledge.
