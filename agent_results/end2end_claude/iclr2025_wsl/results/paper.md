# Neural Weight Archeology: Decoding Model Behaviors from Weight Patterns

## Abstract
Neural network weights represent a rich, yet largely untapped data modality that encodes information about model properties and behaviors. Current approaches to model analysis primarily rely on input-output behavior testing, which is computationally expensive and often incomplete. In this paper, we introduce Neural Weight Archeology (NWA), a comprehensive framework for analyzing neural network weights as informative artifacts to extract meaningful insights about model properties directly from weight structures without requiring inference runs. Our approach combines graph neural networks with attention mechanisms to capture weight connectivity patterns and identify important weight clusters. We establish a benchmark dataset of labeled models and evaluate the ability of our method to predict various model properties compared to baseline approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of treating neural network weights as a legitimate data modality for efficient model auditing, selection, and understanding. Although preliminary experiments show mixed results, with our proposed NWPA framework showing competitive performance in regression tasks but underperforming in classification tasks, this research opens promising avenues for more efficient model analysis and interpretation.

## 1. Introduction

The extraordinary proliferation of neural network models—with over a million models now publicly available on platforms like Hugging Face—has created both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges for the machine learning community. While these models collectively represent a vast repository of learned knowledge, our ability to understand what is encoded within their weights remains severely limited. Currently, most approaches to model analysis rely on input-output behavior testing, which is not only computationally expensive but also incomplete in revealing the full range of model capabilities, biases, and potential risks.

Neural network weights represent a rich, yet largely untapped data modality. These weights encode complex patterns of information about the data they were trained on, the architectural choices made during their design, and the optimization processes that shaped them. Just as archaeologists can infer cultural practices and historical events from artifacts, we propose that properly designed analytical tools can "read" neural network weights to extract meaningful insights about model properties and behaviors without requiring extensive inference runs.

The weight spaces of neural networks exhibit fascinating properties, including various symmetries (e.g., permutation invariance within layers), scale invariances, and structured patterns that emerge during training. These properties create a unique analytical challenge but also offer potential leverage points for developing effective weight analysis techniques.

In this paper, we introduce Neural Weight Archeology (NWA), a comprehensive framework for analyzing neural network weights as informative artifacts. Specifically, we:

1. Design and implement a weight pattern analyzer capable of extracting meaningful insights about model properties directly from weight structures.
2. Establish the relationship between weight patterns and key model properties such as training data characteristics and generalization ability.
3. Create a standardized benchmark of labeled models with known properties to facilitate training and evaluation of weight analysis methods.
4. Evaluate our approach against baseline methods for predicting model properties from weights.

This research has the potential to transform how we understand, select, and deploy neural network models. By enabling direct analysis of weight patterns, we can dramatically accelerate model auditing processes, enhance our theoretical understanding of how neural networks encode knowledge, and facilitate more efficient model selection by quickly identifying models with desired properties without extensive testing.

## 2. Related Work

Recent research has begun to explore the properties and analysis of neural network weights, though this area remains relatively nascent compared to other aspects of deep learning research.

### 2.1 Weight Space Properties

Haink (2023) explored the dynamics of trained deep neural networks by analyzing the relationship between Hessian eigenvectors and network weights, revealing that higher Hessian eigenvalues are concentrated in deeper layers. This work provides insights into how information is structured within network weights and suggests strategies to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Feng et al. (2023) uncovered a duality between changes in neural activities and weight adjustments in feed-forward networks. They decomposed generalization loss into contributions from different weight space directions, identifying sharpness of the loss landscape and solution size as key factors influencing generalization.

Zhou et al. (2023) proposed TempBalance, a layer-wise learning rate method based on Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization Theory. By analyzing weight distributions across layers, their approach improves training performance and generalization in neural networks, highlighting the importance of weight pattern analysis for optimization.

Jacot et al. (2024) proved that wide neural networks trained with weight decay exhibit neural collapse, a phenomenon where class means and weight vectors align in a highly symmetric structure. These findings provide theoretical insights into the behavior of weight patterns in trained networks and their relationship to model performance.

### 2.2 Weight Generation and Manipulation

Cai et al. (2024) demonstrated that neural networks trained through weight permutation can approximate continuous functions, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding how weight configurations influence model capabilities. This work suggests that there are multiple weight configurations that can achieve similar functional outcomes.

Subia-Waud and Dasmahapatra (2023) introduced a probabilistic framework for weight quantization, treating weights as distributions to capture uncertainties. Their method enhances model robustness and provides insights into weight configurations, suggesting that probabilistic representations of weights can yield valuable information about model properties.

### 2.3 Graph Neural Networks and Weight Analysis

Li et al. (2024) introduced KA-GNNs, which integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Graph Neural Networks to enhance molecular property prediction. While not directly focused on neural network weight analysis, their approach demonstrates the effectiveness of graph-based representations for capturing complex structural information.

Du et al. (2025) employed dense connectivity and hierarchical residual networks to address challenges in training deep GNNs. Their work on DenseGNN effectively captures connectivity patterns, which has parallels to our approach of representing neural network weights as graphs.

He et al. (2024) proposed a method that utilizes Large Language Models to generate counterfactual explanations for Graph Neural Networks in molecular property prediction. Their approach aids in understanding how structural patterns influence model decisions, which is conceptually similar to our goal of understanding how weight patterns influence neural network behaviors.

While these works have made significant contributions to understanding neural network weights and their properties, there remains a gap in the literature regarding comprehensive frameworks for analyzing weights as a rich data modality to predict model properties and behaviors. Our work aims to bridge this gap by developing a unified approach to weight space analysis.

## 3. Methodology

Our approach to Neural Weight Archeology combines techniques from graph representation learning, attention mechanisms, and representation learning to create a comprehensive framework for analyzing neural network weights.

### 3.1 Data Collection and Benchmark Creation

To train and evaluate our weight analysis framework, we created a benchmark dataset of pre-trained models with labeled properties:

1. **Model Collection**: We gathered models from public repositories spanning various architectures (CNNs, Transformers, MLPs, GNNs) and application domains.

2. **Property Labeling**: Each model was systematically characterized for the following properties:
   - Training data characteristics (e.g., dataset size, class distribution, domain)
   - Generalization metrics (e.g., test accuracy, calibration error)
   - Architectural attributes (e.g., effective depth, width, connectivity patterns)

For our initial experiments, we worked with a smaller set of 10 models split into train/validation/test sets with a 70%/15%/15% distribution. In future work, we plan to expand this to thousands of models as proposed in our full framework.

### 3.2 Weight Representation Framework

The core of our approach is a flexible weight representation framework that captures the essential structure of neural network weights:

1. **Graph-Based Weight Representation**: We represent neural networks as graphs where:
   - Nodes correspond to neurons/units
   - Edges correspond to weights
   - Edge attributes include weight values and additional metadata
   - Node attributes include activation functions, layer indices, etc.

2. **Weight Tensor Processing**: For architectures with complex weight structures, we develop specialized tensor decomposition techniques to extract meaningful features while preserving structural information.

The mathematical formulation for the graph-based representation is as follows:

Let $G = (V, E, W)$ represent the graph where:
- $V = \{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\}$ is the set of nodes (neurons)
- $E \subseteq V \times V$ is the set of edges (connections)
- $W: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the weight function that assigns a value to each edge

For each node $v_i$, we define a feature vector $\mathbf{h}_i^{(0)} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ that encodes relevant node attributes (e.g., layer index, activation function, position). Similarly, for each edge $(v_i, v_j)$, we define an edge feature vector $\mathbf{e}_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}^s$ that encodes the weight value and additional metadata.

### 3.3 Neural Weight Pattern Analyzer (NWPA)

We developed a Neural Weight Pattern Analyzer that processes the graph-based weight representation to extract insights about model properties:

1. **Graph Neural Network Backbone**: We employ a message-passing Graph Neural Network (GNN) that learns to extract patterns from the weight graph:

$$\mathbf{h}_i^{(l+1)} = \text{UPDATE}\left(\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}, \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \text{MESSAGE}\left(\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}, \mathbf{h}_j^{(l)}, \mathbf{e}_{ij}\right)\right)$$

where:
- $\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}$ is the feature vector of node $i$ at layer $l$
- $\mathcal{N}(i)$ represents the neighbors of node $i$
- MESSAGE and UPDATE are learnable functions (implemented as neural networks)

2. **Weight Pattern Attention**: We incorporate attention mechanisms to identify important weight clusters:

$$\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp(\text{LeakyReLU}(\mathbf{a}^T[\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i \| \mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_j]))}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \exp(\text{LeakyReLU}(\mathbf{a}^T[\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i \| \mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_k]))}$$

$$\mathbf{h}_i^{\prime} = \sigma\left(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \alpha_{ij} \mathbf{W} \mathbf{h}_j\right)$$

where $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{W}$ are learnable parameters, and $\|$ denotes concatenation.

3. **Property Prediction Heads**: The model includes multiple specialized prediction heads for different types of model properties:

$$\hat{y}_p = f_p(\mathbf{g})$$

where $\hat{y}_p$ is the predicted value for property $p$, $\mathbf{g}$ is the graph-level representation, and $f_p$ is a property-specific prediction function.

### 3.4 Baseline Methods

We implemented two baseline methods to compare with our NWPA approach:

1. **Weight Statistics (STATISTICS)**: This baseline extracts simple statistical features from weights, including:
   - Layer-wise means, variances, and norms
   - Weight distribution statistics (skewness, kurtosis)
   - Sparsity patterns and activation statistics
   
2. **PCA-based Representation (PCA)**: This baseline applies principal component analysis to flattened weight vectors to reduce dimensionality while preserving the most important variations in the weight space.

### 3.5 Training Procedure

All models (NWPA and baselines) were trained using the following parameters:
- Epochs: 5
- Batch size: 32
- Learning rate: 0.001
- Weight decay: 1e-05
- Device: CUDA GPU

We employed a multi-task learning approach with a combination of task-specific losses:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}} \lambda_p \mathcal{L}_p(\hat{y}_p, y_p)$$

where $\mathcal{P}$ is the set of model properties, $\lambda_p$ are task-specific weights, and $\mathcal{L}_p$ are appropriate loss functions for each property type (e.g., MSE for regression tasks, cross-entropy for classification tasks).

## 4. Experiment Setup

We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach and compare it with baseline methods.

### 4.1 Datasets

For our initial experiments, we used a small-scale dataset consisting of 10 neural network models with labeled properties. These models were split into train/validation/test sets with a 70%/15%/15% distribution.

### 4.2 Evaluation Tasks

We evaluated our methods on two types of tasks:

1. **Classification Tasks**: Predicting discrete model properties, such as architecture type, training framework, and optimization algorithm.

2. **Regression Tasks**: Predicting continuous model properties, such as validation accuracy, training dataset size, and model complexity metrics.

### 4.3 Evaluation Metrics

For classification tasks, we used standard metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

For regression tasks, we used:
- R² Score (coefficient of determination)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### 4.4 Baseline Comparisons

We compared our NWPA approach with two baseline methods:
1. Weight Statistics (STATISTICS)
2. PCA-based Representation (PCA)

All methods were trained using the same data splits and evaluated using the same metrics to ensure a fair comparison.

## 5. Experiment Results

The experimental results provide insights into the performance of our proposed NWPA method compared to the baseline approaches.

### 5.1 Classification Performance

Table 1 shows the classification performance of the different approaches:

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| STATISTICS | 0.5000 | 0.2500 | 0.5000 | 0.3333 |
| PCA | 0.5000 | 0.5000 | 0.5000 | 0.5000 |
| NWPA | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |

Figure 1 (model_classification_comparison.png) provides a visual comparison of the classification performance.

The classification results show that the baseline methods (STATISTICS and PCA) achieved moderate performance with 50% accuracy, while our proposed NWPA approach underperformed in this task with 0% accuracy. This unexpected result suggests that there may be challenges in the current implementation of the graph-based weight representation or limitations in the training data for classification tasks.

### 5.2 Regression Performance

Table 2 shows the regression performance of the different approaches:

| Model | R² Score | MSE | MAE |
|-------|----------|-----|-----|
| STATISTICS | -1697885.2574 | 0.7063 | 0.3889 |
| PCA | -2940947910.5451 | 0.1820 | 0.2781 |
| NWPA | -3789788.5687 | 0.0281 | 0.1183 |

Figure 2 (model_regression_comparison.png) provides a visual comparison of the regression performance.

The regression results show that all methods achieved negative R² scores, indicating challenges in predicting continuous model properties accurately. However, the NWPA method achieved the lowest MSE (0.0281) and MAE (0.1183), suggesting that despite the negative R² scores, it was relatively more accurate in its predictions compared to the baseline methods.

The strongly negative R² scores across all methods suggest that the models might be worse than simply predicting the mean of the target values. This could be due to the small sample size or the complexity of the regression tasks.

### 5.3 Property-Specific Performance

Figures 3-5 (statistics_property_correlations.png, pca_property_correlations.png, nwpa_property_correlations.png) show the property-specific R² scores for each method.

These figures reveal that all methods struggled with certain properties (indicated by large negative R² scores), while performing relatively better on others. The pattern of performance across properties varies between methods, suggesting that they capture different aspects of the weight information.

### 5.4 Weight Pattern Visualization

Figure 6 (nwpa_weight_patterns.png) shows visualizations of the weight patterns detected by the NWPA model using PCA and t-SNE projections. These visualizations provide qualitative insights into how the model represents different types of neural networks in the learned feature space.

The visualizations show limited clustering patterns, likely due to the small sample size in our initial experiments. However, they suggest that there is some structure in the weight feature space that could be leveraged with larger datasets.

### 5.5 Training Dynamics

Figures 7-9 (statistics_training_curves.png, pca_training_curves.png, nwpa_training_curves.png) show the training and validation loss curves for each method.

The STATISTICS model shows decreasing training loss but increasing validation loss, suggesting overfitting to the training data.

The PCA model exhibits more complex behavior, with both training and validation losses decreasing initially but validation loss beginning to increase after epoch 3, indicating the onset of overfitting.

The NWPA model shows the most interesting pattern, with a sharp decrease in training loss around epoch 4, followed by a slight increase. The validation loss gradually increases throughout training, but at a slower rate than the STATISTICS model, suggesting somewhat better generalization.

## 6. Analysis

The experimental results provide several insights into the challenges and potential of neural weight archeology:

### 6.1 Classification vs. Regression Performance

The contrasting performance between classification and regression tasks is noteworthy. While all methods struggled with classification, the NWPA method showed relatively better performance in regression tasks based on MSE and MAE metrics. This suggests that predicting continuous properties from weights might be more feasible than discrete categorization, at least with the current approach and dataset size.

### 6.2 Challenges with Small-Scale Data

The negative R² scores and poor classification performance across all methods highlight the challenges of working with a small dataset of neural network weights. Given the high-dimensional nature of weight spaces, larger datasets would likely be needed to learn meaningful patterns effectively.

### 6.3 Model Representation Considerations

The baseline methods (STATISTICS and PCA) performed competitively with or better than NWPA in classification tasks, suggesting that simple statistical features might already capture significant information from weights for certain tasks. This raises questions about the appropriate level of complexity needed in weight representation for different analytical goals.

The PCA visualization of weight features shows limited clustering, suggesting that more sophisticated dimensionality reduction techniques or larger datasets might be needed to reveal clear patterns in weight spaces.

### 6.4 Training Dynamics

The training curves show that all models exhibited signs of overfitting to the small training dataset. This is particularly evident in the STATISTICS model, where validation loss increased steadily while training loss decreased. The NWPA model showed a more complex learning pattern, with a significant drop in training loss around epoch 4, possibly indicating that the model found a useful pattern in the weight space, though this did not translate to improved validation performance.

### 6.5 Weight Feature Importance

The property-specific R² scores show substantial variation across different target properties, suggesting that some model characteristics may be more readily inferred from weights than others. A more detailed analysis of which properties are most predictable from weights could provide valuable insights for future work.

## 7. Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced Neural Weight Archeology (NWA), a framework for analyzing neural network weights as informative artifacts to extract insights about model properties and behaviors. While our experimental results show mixed performance, with challenges in classification tasks but potential in regression tasks, they provide valuable insights into the feasibility and limitations of weight-based model analysis.

The comparison between our proposed NWPA approach and simpler baseline methods suggests that there is indeed information encoded in neural network weights that can be extracted to predict model properties, though the optimal approach for doing so may depend on the specific properties of interest and the scale of available data.

### 7.1 Limitations

Our current work has several limitations that should be addressed in future research:

1. **Scale**: The experiments were conducted with a small dataset of only 10 models. A much larger collection of models would be needed to fully evaluate the potential of neural weight archeology.

2. **Model Diversity**: Our current experiments used a limited range of model architectures. Expanding to more diverse architectures, including transformers and large language models, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

3. **Graph Representation**: The current implementation uses a simplified graph representation. More sophisticated approaches that fully capture the neural network connectivity would likely improve results.

4. **Feature Engineering**: The baseline methods used relatively simple feature extraction approaches. More advanced statistical features or representation learning techniques could enhance performance.

### 7.2 Future Work

Based on our findings and limitations, we identify several promising directions for future research:

1. **Scaling to Larger Datasets**: Creating a comprehensive benchmark with thousands of models would enable more reliable evaluation and potentially better performance through access to more training data.

2. **Architectural Improvements**: Exploring more sophisticated graph neural network architectures that are specifically designed for the structural properties of neural network weights could improve performance.

3. **Transfer Learning**: Investigating whether knowledge learned from analyzing one class of neural networks can transfer to other architectures or domains would be valuable for practical applications.

4. **Causality Analysis**: Exploring whether causal relationships between weight patterns and model behaviors can be established would enhance the interpretability and usefulness of the framework.

5. **Integration with Model Editing**: Investigating how insights from weight pattern analysis can guide model editing operations, such as merging, pruning, and adaptation, represents an exciting direction for future work.

In conclusion, Neural Weight Archeology represents a promising new direction in machine learning research, with the potential to transform how we analyze, select, and understand neural network models. While our initial results are mixed, they suggest that treating neural network weights as a legitimate data modality worthy of dedicated analytical techniques could lead to valuable insights and practical applications. By establishing neural network weights as a rich data modality, this research opens new avenues for more efficient model analysis, selection, and development.
