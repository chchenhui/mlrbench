**2. Key Challenges**

The main challenges and limitations in current research on decoding model behaviors from weight patterns include:

1. **Complexity of Weight Space**: Neural networks possess high-dimensional weight spaces with intricate structures, making it difficult to interpret and extract meaningful patterns directly from the weights.

2. **Lack of Standardized Benchmarks**: There is an absence of standardized datasets and benchmarks with labeled models that have known properties, hindering the development and evaluation of weight analysis methods.

3. **Computational Constraints**: Analyzing weight patterns, especially in large-scale models, requires significant computational resources, posing challenges for scalability and efficiency.

4. **Generalization of Findings**: Insights derived from weight analysis in specific models or tasks may not generalize well across different architectures or domains, limiting the applicability of the findings.

5. **Integration with Existing Tools**: Developing tools that can seamlessly integrate weight pattern analysis into existing machine learning pipelines without disrupting workflows remains a challenge.
