# Causally-Informed Multi-Modal Representation Learning for Robust Performance Against Shortcut Learning (CIMRL)

## 1. Introduction

### Background
The remarkable success of Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) has transformed numerous applications across diverse domains. These models integrate information from multiple modalities (e.g., text, images, audio) to perform complex tasks ranging from visual question answering to medical diagnosis and autonomous navigation. Despite their impressive capabilities, LMMs remain susceptible to a fundamental limitation known as shortcut learning or spurious correlation reliance. This phenomenon occurs when models exploit statistical patterns in training data that do not reflect true causal relationships but happen to correlate with target outcomes.

In multi-modal contexts, the problem is particularly pernicious as spurious correlations can exist both within and across modalities. For instance, a medical diagnosis model might rely on irrelevant background features in X-ray images rather than actual pathological indicators, or a visual reasoning model might exploit statistical regularities in question-answer pairings rather than understanding the visual content. Recent work by Hosseini et al. (2024) demonstrates that state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs can be highly susceptible to spurious visual cues, often leading to object hallucination and incorrect reasoning.

Traditional approaches to mitigate shortcut learning typically require explicit identification of spurious features or extensive group annotations (Zhou & Zhu, 2024), making them impractical for real-world deployment. This dependency on prior knowledge creates a significant barrier to developing robust systems, especially in high-stakes domains where unidentified spurious correlations can lead to dangerous failures.

### Research Objectives
This research proposal aims to develop a robust framework for multi-modal representation learning that inherently mitigates shortcut learning without requiring explicit annotation of spurious features. Our objectives are to:

1. Design a causal representation learning framework specifically for multi-modal data that can automatically distinguish between causal and spurious features across modalities.

2. Develop a contrastive invariance mechanism that identifies and preserves causally relevant features while discarding spurious correlations.

3. Create a modality disentanglement component that separates shared causal features from modality-specific spurious ones.

4. Implement an intervention-based fine-tuning approach enabling models to maintain predictions when spurious features are manipulated.

5. Validate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse multi-modal tasks and evaluate its performance against state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

### Significance
The proposed research addresses a fundamental challenge in machine learning with far-reaching implications. By developing methods that can automatically identify and mitigate reliance on spurious correlations across modalities, we can significantly enhance the robustness and reliability of multi-modal systems in critical applications.

Our approach is particularly significant because:

1. It tackles shortcut learning without requiring prior knowledge of spurious features, making it applicable to new domains and datasets where such knowledge is unavailable.

2. It provides a principled framework for improving out-of-distribution generalization in multi-modal models, a critical requirement for deployment in dynamic real-world environments.

3. It offers a fine-tuning methodology compatible with existing foundation models, ensuring practical deployment without requiring complete retraining of resource-intensive models.

4. It advances our theoretical understanding of causal representation learning in multi-modal contexts, contributing to the broader field of robust AI.

As AI systems increasingly power critical applications, ensuring they rely on causal rather than spurious features becomes essential for safety, fairness, and reliability. Our proposed framework directly addresses this need, potentially transforming how multi-modal models are developed and deployed across diverse domains.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed framework, Causally-Informed Multi-Modal Representation Learning (CIMRL), consists of several interdependent components designed to identify, disentangle, and mitigate spurious correlations in multi-modal data. The methodology leverages causal principles to distinguish between features that have a genuine causal relationship with the target and those that merely correlate spuriously.

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

We will evaluate our framework on established multi-modal datasets containing known spurious correlations, as well as creating synthetic datasets with controlled spurious features. Specifically, we will use:

1. **Existing datasets**: We will use the Waterbirds dataset (land birds vs. waterbirds with background as spurious feature), the MultiModal CelebA dataset (augmenting CelebA with text descriptions where gender might correlate with attributes), and medical imaging datasets where acquisition artifacts correlate with diagnoses.

2. **Synthetic datasets**: We will create controlled multi-modal datasets by introducing artificial spurious correlations between modalities. For example, we will pair images with text descriptions where certain visual features artificially correlate with specific linguistic patterns.

For preprocessing, we will implement:
- Standard normalization of input features across modalities
- Data augmentation techniques including random cropping, flipping, and color jittering for images
- Text augmentation methods such as synonym replacement, random insertion/deletion, and back-translation

### Core Algorithm

The CIMRL framework consists of three key components:

#### 1. Contrastive Invariance Mechanism

The contrastive invariance mechanism identifies features that remain stable across intentionally perturbed inputs. For each sample $(x_i^1, x_i^2, ..., x_i^M, y_i)$ with $M$ modalities and label $y_i$, we create perturbed versions $(\tilde{x}_i^1, \tilde{x}_i^2, ..., \tilde{x}_i^M)$ using targeted data augmentation. The model is trained to minimize the distance between representations of original and perturbed samples while maximizing the distance to negative samples.

The contrastive invariance loss is defined as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{CI} = -\sum_{i=1}^N \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, \tilde{z}_i)/\tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, \tilde{z}_i)/\tau) + \sum_{j \neq i}\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_j)/\tau)}$$

where $z_i$ and $\tilde{z}_i$ are the representations of the original and perturbed samples, $\text{sim}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the cosine similarity, and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.

#### 2. Modality Disentanglement Component

The modality disentanglement component separates shared causal features from modality-specific spurious ones by analyzing cross-modal prediction errors. We introduce separate encoders $E_m$ for each modality $m$ and a shared encoder $E_S$ for cross-modal features:

$$h_m = E_m(x^m)$$
$$h_S = E_S([x^1, x^2, ..., x^M])$$

We then train the model to perform predictions using different combinations of modality-specific and shared representations:

$$\hat{y}_m = f_m(h_m)$$
$$\hat{y}_S = f_S(h_S)$$
$$\hat{y}_{combined} = f_C([h_1, h_2, ..., h_M, h_S])$$

The modality disentanglement loss enforces that shared representations focus on causal features:

$$\mathcal{L}_{MD} = \alpha \sum_m \mathcal{L}_{CE}(\hat{y}_m, y) + \beta \mathcal{L}_{CE}(\hat{y}_S, y) + \gamma \mathcal{L}_{CE}(\hat{y}_{combined}, y) + \lambda \sum_m \mathcal{L}_{ortho}(h_m, h_S)$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{CE}$ is the cross-entropy loss, $\mathcal{L}_{ortho}$ is an orthogonality constraint between modality-specific and shared representations, and $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\lambda$ are hyperparameters.

#### 3. Intervention-based Fine-tuning

The intervention-based fine-tuning approach trains the model to maintain predictions when spurious features are manipulated. We identify potential spurious features through gradient attribution and create counterfactual samples by intervening on these features:

1. For each training example, we compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the input: $\nabla_{x^m} \mathcal{L}(f(x^1, ..., x^M), y)$

2. We identify potential spurious features by analyzing the gradient patterns across correctly and incorrectly classified examples

3. We create counterfactual samples by modifying the identified potential spurious features: $x^m_{CF} = x^m + \delta^m$

4. We train the model to maintain consistent predictions for these counterfactual samples:

$$\mathcal{L}_{IF} = \mathcal{L}_{CE}(f(x^1, ..., x^M), y) + \mu \mathcal{L}_{KL}(f(x^1, ..., x^M_{CF}, ...), f(x^1, ..., x^M, ...))$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{KL}$ is the KL-divergence between predictions on original and counterfactual samples, and $\mu$ is a hyperparameter.

#### Combined Loss Function

The overall loss function combines all components:

$$\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{CE} + \omega_1 \mathcal{L}_{CI} + \omega_2 \mathcal{L}_{MD} + \omega_3 \mathcal{L}_{IF}$$

where $\omega_1$, $\omega_2$, and $\omega_3$ are weights for each component.

### Model Architecture

We will implement CIMRL as an extension layer on top of existing foundation models:

1. For vision modality: We will use pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) or ResNet backbones
2. For text modality: We will use pre-trained BERT or RoBERTa architectures
3. For cross-modal processing: We will implement a cross-attention mechanism similar to that used in mPLUG (Li et al., 2022)

The key addition will be our causal representation learning layers, which will be inserted between the pre-trained encoders and the task-specific heads.

### Experimental Design

We will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CIMRL across multiple dimensions:

#### Benchmark Tasks and Datasets

1. **Image-Text Classification**: Using Waterbirds, CelebA+text, and MS-COCO with synthetic spurious correlations

2. **Visual Question Answering**: Using VQA-CP, where question types correlate with answers

3. **Medical Diagnosis**: Using multi-modal datasets (e.g., MIMIC-CXR with clinical notes) where acquisition artifacts correlate with diagnoses

4. **Domain Generalization**: Testing on out-of-distribution versions of the above datasets

#### Baselines

We will compare CIMRL against several baselines:

1. Standard fine-tuning of pre-trained multi-modal models without robustness interventions
2. Group DRO (Distributionally Robust Optimization) with group annotations
3. JTT (Just Train Twice) and other upweighting methods
4. The CCR method (Zhou & Zhu, 2024) adapted for multi-modal data
5. The multi-modal contrastive approach of Yang et al. (2023)

#### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Standard Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, F1 score, AUROC on in-distribution test sets

2. **Out-of-Distribution Robustness**: 
   - Worst-group accuracy across demographic or spurious attribute groups
   - Performance on datasets with altered spurious correlation patterns
   - Average accuracy drop when spurious features are randomized

3. **Causal Feature Identification**:
   - Overlap between identified features and known causal features (where available)
   - Activation map alignment with ground truth regions of interest (e.g., in medical imaging)
   - Consistency of predictions under counterfactual interventions

4. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - Training time relative to baselines
   - Inference overhead compared to the base model

#### Implementation Details

Our experiments will be conducted using:
- PyTorch as the deep learning framework
- NVIDIA A100 GPUs for training
- We will release all code, model weights, and data preprocessing scripts publicly
- Each experiment will be run with 5 different random seeds to ensure statistical significance

#### Ablation Studies

We will conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component:

1. CIMRL without the contrastive invariance mechanism
2. CIMRL without the modality disentanglement component
3. CIMRL without the intervention-based fine-tuning
4. Variations in the weighting parameters $\omega_1$, $\omega_2$, and $\omega_3$
5. Different choices of pre-trained encoders for each modality

6. **Educational Tools**: Our visualization and interpretation methods could serve as educational tools, helping practitioners understand and address shortcut learning in their own models.

### Limitations and Future Directions

While we anticipate significant advances from this research, several limitations and future directions should be acknowledged:

1. **Computational Requirements**: Although designed to be efficient, our approach still requires additional computation compared to standard fine-tuning. Future work could explore further optimizations.

2. **Causal Ambiguity**: In some domains, the distinction between causal and spurious features may be ambiguous or context-dependent. Further research into causal discovery methods could address this limitation.

3. **Modality-Specific Challenges**: Different modalities present unique challenges for identifying spurious correlations. Future work could develop more specialized techniques for particular modality combinations.

4. **Extension to Self-Supervised Learning**: Extending our approach to self-supervised learning scenarios, where labeled data is scarce, represents an important future direction.

5. **Theoretical Guarantees**: Developing formal theoretical guarantees for the identification of causal features remains an open challenge that could significantly strengthen the foundation of this work.

In conclusion, the proposed CIMRL framework represents a significant step toward more robust and reliable multi-modal AI systems. By addressing the fundamental challenge of shortcut learning without requiring explicit annotation of spurious features, our approach has the potential to transform how multi-modal models are developed and deployed across diverse domains.
