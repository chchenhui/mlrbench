Interpretable Language Models for Low-Resource Languages: Enhancing Transparency and Equity

## 2. Introduction

### Background
Language models (LMs) have become ubiquitous in natural language processing (NLP), transforming various applications from machine translation to sentiment analysis. However, the development and deployment of these models pose significant challenges when applied to low-resource languages. Low-resource languages are those with limited availability of annotated data, making it challenging to train robust and accurate models. Furthermore, the lack of transparency in these models exacerbates issues of bias and reliability, particularly when deployed in communities where linguistic diversity is high and trust in technology is low.

### Research Objectives
The primary objectives of this research are:
1. To develop an interpretability framework tailored to low-resource language models.
2. To extend local explanation techniques to accommodate unique linguistic features of low-resource languages.
3. To collaborate with native speakers to co-design intuitive explanation interfaces that align with cultural communication norms.
4. To establish evaluation metrics assessing both technical robustness and user-perceived trust.
5. To create open-source tools for model introspection and guidelines for culturally grounded explainability.

### Significance
This research aims to address critical gaps in socially responsible AI by making LMs both accessible and accountable for underrepresented languages. By enhancing transparency and interpretability, we can reduce bias risks, foster equitable LM adoption, and empower communities to audit and refine models. This work aligns with the goals of the SoLaR workshop, promoting fairness, equity, accountability, transparency, and safety in language modeling research.

## 3. Methodology

### Data Collection
The data for this research will include:
1. **Multilingual Corpora**: Datasets covering low-resource languages, such as those provided by Glot500 and InkubaLM.
2. **Code-Switching Data**: Corpora that include frequent code-switching patterns to test the robustness of the interpretability framework.
3. **Community Feedback**: Surveys and interviews with native speakers to gather insights into cultural communication norms and user trust.

### Algorithmic Steps
1. **Local Explanation Techniques**: Extend local explanation methods like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to accommodate unique linguistic features.
   - **SHAP Adaptation**: Modify SHAP values to account for morphological and syntactic complexities in low-resource languages.
   - **LIME Adaptation**: Adjust LIME to handle code-switching patterns by incorporating language identification models like GlotLID.

2. **Community Collaboration**: Work with native speakers to co-design intuitive explanation interfaces.
   - **Interface Design**: Develop user-friendly interfaces that align with cultural communication norms.
   - **User Testing**: Conduct usability tests with native speakers to refine the interfaces.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Technical Robustness**: Assess model performance under perturbed input tests to ensure robustness.
   - **User-Perceived Trust**: Evaluate trust through surveys and task-based trials with native speakers.

### Experimental Design
1. **Model Training**: Train low-resource language models using datasets like Glot500 and InkubaLM.
2. **Interpretability Application**: Apply the adapted local explanation techniques to the trained models.
3. **Community Engagement**: Collaborate with native speakers to validate and refine the explanation interfaces.
4. **Evaluation**: Conduct evaluations using both technical robustness tests and user-perceived trust metrics.

### Evaluation Metrics
1. **Technical Robustness**:
   - **Perturbation Tests**: Measure the model's performance under perturbed inputs to assess robustness.
   - **Accuracy and F1 Score**: Evaluate the model's accuracy and F1 score on relevant tasks.
   - **SHAP and LIME Performance**: Assess the accuracy and interpretability of the adapted explanation techniques.

2. **User-Perceived Trust**:
   - **Surveys**: Conduct surveys with native speakers to gauge their trust in the model's outputs.
   - **Task-Based Trials**: Evaluate the model's performance in real-world scenarios and gather user feedback.
   - **Usability Tests**: Assess the effectiveness and usability of the explanation interfaces.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes
1. **Interpretability Framework**: A comprehensive framework that extends local explanation techniques to accommodate unique linguistic features of low-resource languages.
2. **Community-Centered Explanation Interfaces**: Intuitive and culturally grounded interfaces designed in collaboration with native speakers.
