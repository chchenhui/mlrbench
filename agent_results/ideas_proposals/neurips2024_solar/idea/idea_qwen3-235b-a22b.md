1. **Title**: **Causal Reasoning for Mitigating Intersectional Bias in Language Models**  

2. **Motivation**:  
Language models often perpetuate harmful biases against marginalized groups, especially when sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, disability) intersect. Existing bias mitigation techniques typically address single-axis biases in isolation, failing to capture complex, overlapping disparities. This gap risks exacerbating exclusion for underrepresented communities. Developing methods to systematically identify and mitigate intersectional biases is critical for equitable AI deployment.  

3. **Main Idea**:  
We propose a causal reasoning framework to model and mitigate intersectional biases in language models. First, we construct a causal graph linking sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race) to model outputs, using counterfactual analysis to disentangle direct and indirect bias pathways. Next, we introduce a training objective that penalizes spurious correlations between intersectional identities and stereotypical representations in the modelâ€™s latent space. This involves adversarial learning to enforce invariance to sensitive attribute combinations and a fairness-aware loss function that prioritizes equitable performance across subgroups. Finally, we validate the approach using intersectional bias benchmarks (e.g., gender-race-occupation stereotypes) and real-world datasets with diverse demographic annotations. Expected outcomes include reduced stereotyping in downstream tasks (e.g., translation, text generation) and a toolkit for auditing intersectional fairness. This work bridges a critical gap in bias research, enabling models to address systemic inequities rather than reinforcing them.
