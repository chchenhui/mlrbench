Title: Causal Counterfactual Explanations for LLM Outputs

Motivation:  
Modern large language models (LLMs) behave as opaque “black boxes,” hindering user trust, regulatory compliance, and the diagnosis of harmful or biased outputs. Generating clear, causally grounded explanations for why an LLM produced a particular response can improve transparency, aid auditing, and guide responsible deployment.

Main Idea:  
We propose a framework that blends causal mediation analysis with counterfactual input perturbations to produce concise, faithful explanations of LLM decisions. First, we identify key input tokens and hidden representations by measuring their influence on the final output via gradient-based saliency and information bottleneck probes. Next, we generate minimal counterfactual edits—e.g., token substitutions or context shifts—that flip the model’s output class or sentiment. By correlating these edits with changes in intermediate activations, we compute causal effect scores for each token and layer. Explanations are then delivered as ranked “what-if” statements (“If you replace X with Y, the answer would differ because layer Z’s activation drops by Δ”). We will evaluate faithfulness against existing benchmarks, measure user trust in a human study, and assess robustness under adversarial edits. This approach promises interpretable, actionable insights into LLM behavior, advancing transparency and accountability.
