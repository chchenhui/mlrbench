1. **Title**: CoNFiLD: Conditional Neural Field Latent Diffusion Model Generating Spatiotemporal Turbulence (arXiv:2403.05940)
   - **Authors**: Pan Du, Meet Hemant Parikh, Xiantao Fan, Xin-Yang Liu, Jian-Xun Wang
   - **Summary**: This study introduces the CoNFiLD model, a generative learning framework designed for rapid simulation of complex spatiotemporal dynamics in turbulent systems within three-dimensional irregular domains. By integrating conditional neural field encoding with latent diffusion processes, CoNFiLD enables efficient and robust probabilistic generation of turbulence under various conditions. The model demonstrates versatility in applications such as zero-shot full-field flow reconstruction from sparse sensor data, super-resolution generation, and spatiotemporal flow data restoration.

2. **Title**: Prediction of Turbulent Channel Flow Using Fourier Neural Operator-Based Machine-Learning Strategy (arXiv:2403.03051)
   - **Authors**: Yunpeng Wang, Zhijie Li, Zelong Yuan, Wenhui Peng, Tianyuan Liu, Jianchun Wang
   - **Summary**: This paper investigates the use of an implicit U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (IUFNO) for stable, long-term prediction of three-dimensional turbulent channel flows. The IUFNO model outperforms traditional large-eddy simulation models in predicting various flow statistics and structures, including mean and fluctuating velocities, Reynolds stress profiles, and kinetic energy spectra. Additionally, the trained IUFNO models are computationally more efficient, making them promising for fast predictions of wall-bounded turbulent flows.

   - **Authors**: Vivek Oommen, Aniruddha Bora, Zhen Zhang, George Em Karniadakis
   - **Summary**: This work addresses the spectral limitations of neural operators in surrogate modeling of turbulent flows by integrating them with diffusion models. The combined approach enhances the resolution of turbulent structures and improves the alignment of predicted energy spectra with true distributions. The method is validated on datasets including high Reynolds number jet flow simulations and experimental Schlieren velocimetry, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing high-frequency flow dynamics.

   - **Authors**: Katsiaryna Haitsiukevich, Onur Poyraz, Pekka Marttinen, Alexander Ilin
   - **Summary**: This paper explores the use of diffusion-based generative models as neural operators for partial differential equations (PDEs). The authors demonstrate that these models can effectively generate PDE solutions conditionally on parameters and recover unobserved parts of dynamical systems. The proposed approach is adaptable to multiple tasks and outperforms other neural operators in experiments with various realistic dynamical systems.

**2. Key Challenges**

1. **High-Dimensional Inverse Problems**: Accurately and efficiently solving inverse problems in high-dimensional spaces, such as turbulent flow fields, remains challenging due to the complexity and computational demands involved.

2. **Data Scarcity**: Limited availability of high-quality data for training models can hinder the development of robust and generalizable solutions for inverse modeling in turbulent flows.

3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Effectively quantifying both epistemic (model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) uncertainties is crucial for reliable predictions but remains a significant challenge in current research.

4. **Simulation-to-Real Gap**: Bridging the gap between simulated environments and real-world applications is difficult due to discrepancies in conditions, leading to reduced model performance in practical scenarios.

5. **Computational Efficiency**: Developing models that balance accuracy with computational efficiency is essential, especially for real-time applications, yet achieving this balance is a persistent challenge.
