Title: Conditional Neural Operator for Probabilistic Inverse Modeling in Turbulent Flows

Motivation:  
Accurate and fast inversion of high-dimensional PDE parameters (e.g., turbulent flow fields) is critical for control, design, and uncertainty quantification. Conventional inference relies on repeated expensive solvers and provides limited posterior estimates under data scarcity.

Main Idea:  
We propose a Conditional Neural Operator (CNO) that jointly learns the forward PDE solution map and an approximate posterior over input parameters given sparse observations. A Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) encodes the PDE structure, while a conditional normalizing flow models the posterior distribution. We train both modules end-to-end via amortized variational inference on synthetically generated Navierâ€“Stokes simulations. At inference time, the CNO delivers real-time posterior samples, supports backpropagation through the surrogate for gradient-based design, and quantifies epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. We will benchmark speed-accuracy trade-offs, assess calibration of predictive intervals, and demonstrate inverse flow identification and control tasks. This framework bridges the simulation-to-real gap by offering a fast, differentiable, and uncertainty-aware inversion engine for complex physical systems.
