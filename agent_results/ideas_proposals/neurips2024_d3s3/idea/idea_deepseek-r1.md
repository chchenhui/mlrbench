**Title**: Bayesian Differentiable Simulators for Uncertainty-Aware Inverse Problems  
**Motivation**: Differentiable simulators enable efficient inverse problem-solving via backpropagation but often lack robust uncertainty quantification, risking overconfident predictions in critical domains like climate modeling and materials science. Integrating Bayesian principles addresses this gap by capturing epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, enhancing decision reliability.  
**Main Idea**: Develop a framework embedding Bayesian neural networks within differentiable simulators, using stochastic variational inference to approximate parameter posteriors. The simulatorâ€™s forward pass samples from probabilistic networks, while inverse optimization employs Bayesian backpropagation to propagate uncertainty gradients. This allows joint estimation of optimal parameters and their confidence intervals. The method will be validated on physics-based tasks (e.g., inferring material properties from deformations) and real-world datasets, comparing uncertainty calibration and optimization efficiency against deterministic baselines. Expected outcomes include a scalable approach for uncertainty-aware inverse solutions, reducing sim2real gaps by explicitly modeling confidence in predictions. Impact: Enables safer deployment of ML-driven simulations in high-stakes applications where risk-aware decisions are paramount.
