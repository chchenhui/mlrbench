**Title:** Physics-Constrained Neural Residuals for Sim2Real Gap Mitigation

**Motivation:** Physical simulators often exhibit discrepancies compared to real-world phenomena (sim2real gap) due to unmodeled effects or calibration errors. Directly correcting complex simulators is challenging. This research aims to improve simulation accuracy by learning corrections directly from sparse real-world data while respecting known physical laws.

**Main Idea:** We propose augmenting existing (potentially differentiable) physical simulators with a Neural Residual Model (NRM). The NRM learns to predict the discrepancy between the simulator's output and corresponding real-world observations. Crucially, the NRM architecture or its training loss incorporates physics-based constraints (e.g., energy conservation, kinematic limits) relevant to the domain. By training the NRM using backpropagation, potentially through the simulator if differentiable, we learn physically plausible corrections that compensate for simulator inaccuracies. This hybrid approach leverages the simulator's structure while adapting it to reality using limited data, leading to more accurate predictions and improved transferability for downstream tasks like control or design optimization.
