Conditional Neural Operator for Probabilistic Inverse Modeling in Turbulent Flows

### 2. Introduction

#### Background

Turbulent flows are ubiquitous in various scientific and engineering domains, ranging from aerodynamics to climate modeling. Accurate and efficient modeling of turbulent flows is essential for control, design, and uncertainty quantification. Traditional methods, such as direct numerical simulations (DNS) and large-eddy simulations (LES), are computationally expensive and limited by data scarcity. Machine Learning (ML) techniques, particularly neural operators, offer promising solutions to bridge the simulation-to-real gap and improve the accuracy and efficiency of turbulent flow modeling.

#### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a Conditional Neural Operator (CNO) for probabilistic inverse modeling in turbulent flows. Specifically, the CNO will jointly learn the forward PDE solution map and an approximate posterior over input parameters given sparse observations. The proposed method aims to:

1. **Accelerate Inverse Modeling**: Provide a fast, differentiable, and uncertainty-aware inversion engine for complex physical systems.
2. **Improve Accuracy**: Enhance the accuracy of inverse modeling by leveraging the differentiability of neural operators.
3. **Quantify Uncertainty**: Offer real-time posterior samples and support backpropagation through the surrogate for gradient-based design and uncertainty quantification.

#### Significance

The proposed CNO framework addresses several key challenges in turbulent flow modeling:
- **High-Dimensional Inverse Problems**: By leveraging neural operators, the CNO can efficiently handle high-dimensional inverse problems.
- **Data Scarcity**: The CNO's ability to generate posterior samples and support backpropagation allows for robust inference even with limited data.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: The CNO provides a comprehensive framework for quantifying both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.
- **Simulation-to-Real Gap**: The CNO's real-time capabilities and differentiability help bridge the gap between simulated environments and real-world applications.

### 3. Methodology

#### Overview

The CNO framework consists of two main components: a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) for encoding the PDE structure and a conditional normalizing flow for modeling the posterior distribution. Both components are trained end-to-end via amortized variational inference on synthetically generated Navier–Stokes simulations. At inference time, the CNO delivers real-time posterior samples, supports backpropagation through the surrogate, and quantifies epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.

#### Data Collection

Synthetic Navier–Stokes simulations are generated using high-performance computing resources. These simulations provide diverse turbulent flow fields with varying parameters, enabling comprehensive training of the CNO. The synthetic data includes:

- **Input Parameters**: Initial conditions, boundary conditions, and physical parameters (e.g., viscosity, density).
- **Observations**: Sparse sensor data, such as velocity measurements at specific points in space and time.
- **Ground Truth**: Exact PDE solutions for validation and evaluation purposes.

#### Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)

The FNO encodes the PDE structure and maps input parameters to forward solutions. The FNO consists of a series of Fourier layers, each applying a linear transformation to the input data in the frequency domain. The FNO can be expressed as:

\[ FNO(x) = \mathcal{F}^{-1} \left( \sum_{j=1}^{N} W_j \cdot \mathcal{F}(x) \right) \]

where \( \mathcal{F} \) denotes the Fourier transform, \( W_j \) are learnable weights, and \( N \) is the number of layers.

#### Conditional Normalizing Flow

The conditional normalizing flow models the posterior distribution of input parameters given sparse observations. The flow consists of a series of invertible transformations, each parameterized by a neural network. The flow can be expressed as:

\[ p(z|y) = \frac{1}{Z(y)} \exp \left( -\log \left| \det \frac{\partial f_{\theta}(z)}{\partial z} \right| \right) \]

where \( z \) represents the input parameters, \( y \) represents the observations, \( f_{\theta}(z) \) denotes the forward transformation, and \( \theta \) represents the learnable parameters of the flow.

#### Amortized Variational Inference

The CNO is trained via amortized variational inference, which involves minimizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) with respect to the learnable parameters of the FNO and the flow. The ELBO can be expressed as:

\[ \mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi) = \mathbb{E}_{q(z|y)} \left[ \log p(y|z) \right] - \text{KL}(q(z|y) || p(z)) \]

where \( q(z|y) \) is the variational posterior distribution, and \( p(z) \) is the prior distribution of input parameters.

#### Experimental Design

The CNO is evaluated on a series of benchmarks, including:

1. **Speed-Accuracy Trade-offs**: Assessing the computational efficiency and accuracy of the CNO compared to traditional methods.
2. **Predictive Interval Calibration**: Evaluating the calibration of predictive intervals generated by the CNO.
3. **Inverse Flow Identification**: Demonstrating the ability of the CNO to identify and control turbulent flow fields.
4. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Assessing the effectiveness of the CNO in quantifying epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.

#### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the CNO is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measuring the accuracy of the CNO's predictions.
- **Computational Time**: Assessing the efficiency of the CNO compared to traditional methods.
- **Calibration**: Evaluating the calibration of predictive intervals using the Brier score.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Assessing the effectiveness of the CNO in quantifying uncertainties using the mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R²).
