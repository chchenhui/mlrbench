# Research Proposal: Conditional Neural Operator for Probabilistic Inverse Modeling in Turbulent Flows

## 1. Introduction

### Background
Turbulent flows, governed by the Navier–Stokes equations, are ubiquitous in engineering and natural systems, from aerospace design to weather prediction. Solving inverse problems—such as reconstructing unknown flow parameters (e.g., viscosity, boundary conditions) from sparse observations—is critical for control, design, and uncertainty quantification. However, conventional methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) require repeated executions of expensive numerical solvers, making them impractical for high-dimensional inverse tasks. Moreover, these approaches struggle to quantify epistemic uncertainty arising from limited data and model approximations.

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer promising alternatives. Neural operators, such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), learn solution maps for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) with near-real-time inference. Meanwhile, probabilistic deep learning frameworks, including normalizing flows and diffusion models, enable efficient sampling from complex posterior distributions. Integrating these techniques could bridge the gap between fast surrogate modeling and uncertainty-aware inversion, addressing key challenges in scientific machine learning.

### Research Objectives
This research aims to develop a **Conditional Neural Operator (CNO)** framework that integrates forward PDE modeling and probabilistic inverse inference into a unified, end-to-end architecture. Specific objectives include:
1. **Architecture Design**: Combine an FNO-based forward solver with a conditional normalizing flow to jointly approximate the PDE solution operator and the posterior distribution of input parameters.
2. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Enable simultaneous estimation of epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data noise) uncertainties via amortized variational inference.
3. **Inverse Problem Solving**: Demonstrate real-time posterior sampling and gradient-based optimization for turbulent flow control tasks.
4. **Validation**: Benchmark the framework against traditional solvers and state-of-the-art ML baselines in terms of speed, accuracy, and uncertainty calibration.

### Significance
The proposed CNO will advance ML-driven scientific computing by:
- **Efficiency**: Replacing iterative PDE solves with a single forward pass through the neural operator, enabling real-time inversion.
- **Differentiability**: Allowing gradient-based optimization for design and control tasks through automatic differentiation of the surrogate.
- **Uncertainty Awareness**: Providing calibrated probabilistic outputs critical for decision-making under data scarcity.
This framework has broad applications in aerospace, climate modeling, and energy systems, where fast and reliable inverse modeling is essential.

## 2. Methodology

### Research Design
The CNO framework comprises two tightly coupled modules: 
1. **Forward Model**: A Fourier Neural Operator maps input parameters (e.g., viscosity, initial conditions) to PDE solutions.
2. **Inverse Model**: A conditional normalizing flow generates posterior samples of parameters given sparse observations.

#### Data Collection
We generate a synthetic dataset of 2D/3D turbulent flow simulations using the Navier–Stokes equations:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u} = -\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}, \quad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0,
$$
where $\mathbf{u}$ is velocity, $p$ is pressure, and $\nu$ is viscosity. Simulations cover a range of Reynolds numbers ($10^2$ to $10^5$), boundary conditions, and forcing terms. Each training example includes:
- Input parameters: $\theta = (\nu, \text{boundary conditions})$
- Full-field solution: $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}, t)$
- Sparse observations: Randomly subsampled $\mathbf{u}$ at 1-5% of spatial locations.

#### Forward Model Architecture
The FNO learns the solution operator $G: \theta \mapsto \mathbf{u}$ by parameterizing the integral kernel in Fourier space. For input function $v$, the FNO layer computes:
$$
(G(v))(x) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(R \cdot \mathcal{F}(v)\right)(x) + Wv(x),
$$
where $\mathcal{F}$ denotes Fourier transform, $R$ is a learnable frequency-domain filter, and $W$ is a linear layer. Stacked FNO layers capture multiscale turbulent structures.

#### Inverse Model Architecture
The conditional normalizing flow models the posterior $p(\theta | \mathbf{y})$ as an invertible transformation $T_\phi$ of a base Gaussian distribution, conditioned on observations $\mathbf{y}$:
$$
\theta = T_\phi(\epsilon; \mathbf{y}), \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I).
$$
The flow $T_\phi$ uses coupling layers with transformer-based conditioners to adaptively incorporate $\mathbf{y}$.

#### Training Objective
Both modules are trained via amortized variational inference, minimizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO):
$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\theta|\mathbf{y})}\left[ \log p_\psi(\mathbf{y}|\theta) \right] - \text{KL}\left(q_\phi(\theta|\mathbf{y}) \| p(\theta)\right),
$$
where $p_\psi(\mathbf{y}|\theta)$ is the likelihood under the FNO-predicted flow field, and $p(\theta)$ is the prior. The KL divergence ensures that $q_\phi$ remains close to the prior while fitting observations.

### Experimental Design
We validate the CNO on three tasks:

#### Task 1: Posterior Estimation for Viscosity Inference
- **Setup**: Infer viscosity $\nu$ given sparse velocity measurements.
- **Baselines**: MCMC, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), and diffusion-based neural operators (arXiv:2405.07097).
- **Metrics**: 
  - Wasserstein distance between estimated and ground-truth posterior.
  - Computational time per sample.
  - Expected calibration error (ECE) for uncertainty intervals.

#### Task 2: Turbulent Flow Reconstruction
- **Setup**: Reconstruct full flow fields from 1% sparse sensors.
- **Baselines**: IUFNO (arXiv:2403.03051), CoNFiLD (arXiv:2403.05940).
- **Metrics**:
  - Root mean square error (RMSE) for velocity/pressure.
  - Energy spectrum $\mathcal{E}(k)$ alignment via Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

#### Task 3: Gradient-Based Flow Control
- **Setup**: Optimize boundary conditions to minimize drag using gradients from CNO.
- **Baselines**: Adjoint-based optimization with FEniCS.
- **Metrics**:
  - Final drag coefficient reduction.
  - Wall-clock time for convergence.
