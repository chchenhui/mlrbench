**LLM-Driven Carbon-Aware Workload Scheduling for Cloud Computing**

---

### 2. Introduction  

#### Background  
Cloud computing datacenters consume over 1% of global electricity, with emissions projected to rise as demand grows. Traditional workload schedulers prioritize performance and cost, often neglecting sustainability. Recent work (e.g., *CarbonScaler* [2023], *CASPER* [2024]) integrates carbon awareness into scheduling but relies on rule-based heuristics or shallow ML models, which struggle with complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Large language models (LLMs) offer transformative potential here due to their ability to model intricate patterns across multimodal data streams (e.g., carbon intensity trends, workload behavior, renewable forecasts). However, no existing system leverages LLMs for *dynamic, holistic carbon optimization* in cloud environments.

#### Research Objectives  
1. **Develop an LLM-based scheduler** that integrates real-time carbon data, workload characteristics, and datacenter efficiency metrics to minimize emissions.  
2. **Design a continuous learning framework** allowing the scheduler to adapt to evolving energy grids, workload mixes, and infrastructure changes.  
3. **Formalize a carbon-aware optimization problem** that balances emissions reduction with service-level agreements (SLAs) and operational constraints.  
4. **Empirically validate** the system’s ability to reduce emissions by 15–30% compared to state-of-the-art schedulers while maintaining performance.  

#### Significance  
This research addresses the ethical and operational imperative for sustainable cloud computing. By enabling datacenters to dynamically shift workloads across time and space based on carbon intensity, the system will:  
- Reduce the environmental impact of cloud infrastructure.  
- Provide a scalable framework for integrating renewable energy forecasts.  
- Establish LLMs as a viable tool for complex systems optimization, advancing the "ML for Systems" paradigm.

### 3. Methodology  

#### Research Design  
The proposed system combines a carbon-aware LLM scheduler with a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for continuous adaptation.  

**Data Collection & Integration**  
- **Carbon Intensity Data**: Real-time and forecasted carbon intensity signals from regional grids (e.g., using APIs like Electricity Maps).  
- **Workload Traces**: Historical and real-time task metadata (e.g., job deadlines, resource requirements) from cloud providers.  
- **Datacenter Metrics**: Server energy efficiency, cooling overheads, and renewable energy availability per location.  
- **Market Signals**: Electricity pricing and carbon credit costs for multi-objective optimization.  

**LLM Architecture**  
The scheduler uses a **fine-tuned transformer model** optimized for spatiotemporal reasoning:  
- **Input Encoding**:  
  - *Temporal Features*: Time of day, carbon intensity forecasts, renewable generation predictions.  
  - *Spatial Features*: Geographic grid regions, datacenter locations.  
  - *Workload Features*: CPU/memory demands, deadlines, priorities.  
- **Output**: A probability distribution over scheduling actions (e.g., deferring workloads, redistributing tasks across regions).  

**Reinforcement Learning Framework**  
The LLM is trained via **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to optimize a multi-objective loss:  

$$
\mathcal{L} = \alpha \cdot \text{CarbonCost} + \beta \cdot \text{SLAPenalty} + \gamma \cdot \text{EnergyCost},
$$  

where:  
- $\text{CarbonCost} = \sum_{t=1}^T \text{EmissionRate}(t) \cdot \text{EnergyUsed}(t)$  
- $\text{SLAPenalty} = \sum_{i=1}^N \max(0, \text{CompletionTime}_i - \text{Deadline}_i)$  
- Coefficients $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ are dynamically adjusted to reflect operator priorities.  

**Algorithm Steps**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize carbon, workload, and infrastructure data into a unified temporal graph structure.  
2. **Training**: Initialize LLM with pre-trained weights (e.g., CodeLlama), then fine-tune using historical data and RL-generated trajectories.  
3. **Inference**: At each timestep, the LLM generates scheduling decisions conditioned on current inputs and minimizes $\mathcal{L}$.  
4. **Continuous Learning**: Deploy a feedback loop where SLA violations and energy usage metrics refine the model’s policy.  

**Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against *PCAPS* [2025], *CASPER* [2024], *CarbonClipper* [2024], and a carbon-agnostic scheduler.  
- **Simulation Environment**: Use CloudSimPlus augmented with real carbon data from 5 geographic regions (e.g., California, Germany, Texas).  
- **Workload Traces**: Replay Google Cluster Data and Alibaba Cluster Trace with synthetic deadline constraints.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - *Carbon Reduction*: Tons of CO₂eq saved vs. baselines.  
  - *SLA Compliance*: Percentage of deadlines met.  
  - *Energy Efficiency*: Compute resource utilization (e.g., PUE-adjusted energy per task).  
  - *Overhead*: Scheduling latency and CPU/memory consumption.

#### Expected Outcomes  
1. **Carbon Reduction**: Demonstrated 15–30% reduction in emissions across diverse workload scenarios.  
2. **Performance**: SLA compliance within 2% of carbon-agnostic schedulers, ensuring practicality.  
3. **Generalization**: Proven efficacy across geographic regions with varying carbon intensity profiles.  
4. **Scalability**: Linear computational overhead growth with cluster size, validated up to 10,000 nodes.  

#### Impact  
- **Environmental**: Enables cloud providers to meet sustainability targets (e.g., Google’s 2030 24/7 carbon-free energy goal).  
- **Technical**: Establishes LLMs as a paradigm for systems optimization, influencing future work on ML-driven resource management.  
- **Economic**: Reduces carbon credit costs for operators and aligns with global carbon pricing policies.
