**Title:** "Agentic Methods for Empowering Programmer Productivity: Learning from Human Feedback in Realistic Coding Tasks"

**Motivation:** Automatic programming is a significant challenge in software development, with researchers addressing it using deep learning-based approaches. However, current models often struggle to learn from human feedback, leading to suboptimal code generation. This research aims to bridge this gap by developing a novel Agentic Method that effectively leverages human feedback to improve code generation, addressing a critical challenge in developer productivity.

**Main Idea:**

Methodology: We propose a hybrid reinforcement learning approach, combining model-based and model-free methods to effectively learn from human feedback. This will involve:

1. Developing a code generator based on transformer models.
2. Creating a feedback mechanism that utilizes human input (corrections, justifications, or ratings) to update the model.
3. Employing a value function to assess the quality of generated code.
4. Using inverse reinforcement learning to align the model's goals with the human feedback.

Expected Outcomes:

* Improved code quality and accuracy by effectively integrating human feedback.
* A robust framework for real-world code generation, capable of adapting to diverse feedback styles.
* Enhanced developer productivity by offering real-time assistance and code suggestions.

Potential Impact:

* Improved code quality and development speed, leading to higher-quality software products.
* The developed method can be applied in various settings, such as educational tools, code completion plugins, or paired programming systems.
