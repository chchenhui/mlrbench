1. **Title**: Agentic Feedback Loops: Integrating Human-AI Collaboration for Realistic Programming Tasks  
2. **Motivation**: Current code-generation agents struggle with complex, open-ended tasks (e.g., resolving GitHub issues) without real-time human guidance, leading to ineﬃcient workflows or misaligned outputs. While reinforcement learning (RL) methods exist, they often lack dynamic adaptation to developer intent, reducing trust and utility. This work addresses the gap in collaborative agent design, prioritizing developer-AI co-creation.  
3. **Main Idea**: Propose a novel agent framework combining RL with human-in-the-loop mechanisms, enabling interactive feedback during task-solving. The agent decomposes tasks into traceable steps, executes partial solutions in a sandboxed environment, and queries developers for preferences at critical decision points via a lightweight interface (e.g., natural language or code comments). These preferences are used in inverse RL to align neural policies with user values. The method prioritizes explainability by visualizing execution states and intent inferences. Evaluation will use realistic GitHub issues (e.g., SciPy/Pandas) and measure task success, developer eﬀort, and code quality. Expected outcomes include improved completion accuracy (by 15-20%) and reduced human correction overhead, fostering trustworthy co-development practices. This directly enhances developer productivity and bridges the HCI gap in agentic coding workflows.
