**Title:** CodeAgent: Integrating Execution and Human Feedback for Aligned GitHub Issue Resolution  

**Motivation:** While AI models can generate code, they often fail to address *realistic* GitHub issues, which require understanding project context, debugging, and alignment with developer intent. Current approaches lack mechanisms to iteratively refine solutions using both execution-based validation and human preferences, limiting practical utility.  

**Main Idea:** Develop **CodeAgent**, an agentic framework that combines *execution feedback* (via automated testing) and *human feedback* (via preference learning) to resolve GitHub issues. The agent first generates candidate patches, validates them through test execution, and then presents a shortlist to developers. Their feedback (e.g., code style, efficiency preferences) is used to fine-tune the model via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The methodology includes:  
1. **Context-aware code synthesis** using retrieval-augmented generation to incorporate project-specific codebases.  
2. **Dynamic test generation** to verify functional correctness.  
3. **Interactive preference learning** to align solutions with developer priorities.  

Expected outcomes include a benchmark for GitHub issue resolution and a model that improves over time with user interaction. This approach bridges the gap between correctness and usability, enhancing developer productivity while ensuring solutions are both functional and contextually appropriate. Potential impact includes scalable, human-aligned tools for software maintenance and collaborative coding.
