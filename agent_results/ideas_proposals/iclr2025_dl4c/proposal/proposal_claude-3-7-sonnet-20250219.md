# Human-AI Co-Adaptation Loops for Personalized Code Assistants: A Framework for Continuous Mutual Learning

## Introduction

Software development has been revolutionized by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) capable of generating and understanding code. Current AI code assistants can suggest completions, fix bugs, and even generate entire functions based on natural language descriptions. Despite these advancements, there remains a significant gap in how these systems adapt to individual developers' unique coding styles, workflows, and preferences. Most existing solutions operate as static tools that fail to evolve with continued use, missing opportunities to become more aligned with specific users over time.

This research proposes a novel framework for human-AI co-adaptation in code assistants, where both the AI system and the human developer continuously learn from each other through iterative interactions. Unlike traditional systems that employ one-way adaptation (either the human learning to use the AI effectively or the AI being trained on general data), our approach establishes a bidirectional learning loop. The AI adapts to the developer's unique coding patterns, preferences, and workflows, while simultaneously providing feedback that helps the developer understand the AI's capabilities and limitations.

Recent work has explored aspects of this problem space. Liu et al. (2024) introduced methods for capturing programming learning styles to provide personalized guidance, while Dai et al. (2024) developed MPCODER to generate code aligned with user-specific style representations. Systems like CodingGenie (Zhao et al., 2025) have implemented proactive suggestions based on code context, but lack sophisticated mechanisms for continuous adaptation. Despite these advances, a comprehensive framework for real-time, bidirectional learning in code assistant systems remains undeveloped.

The significance of this research extends beyond immediate productivity gains. By creating AI assistants that truly adapt to individual developers, we can:
1. Reduce the cognitive load associated with translating between a developer's mental model and the AI system's capabilities
2. Increase code quality by generating suggestions that better align with project-specific conventions and individual practices
3. Enhance developer satisfaction and trust in AI assistants through increased personalization
4. Provide insights into effective human-AI collaboration patterns that can inform broader AI assistant design

This research addresses the fundamental question: How can we design AI code assistants that continuously learn from and adapt to individual developers while enabling developers to shape AI behavior in meaningful ways?

## Methodology

Our research methodology encompasses three interconnected components: (1) a data collection framework embedded within popular IDEs, (2) algorithms for online personalization, and (3) comprehensive evaluation protocols.

### 1. Multi-Modal Feedback Collection Framework

We will develop plugins for Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs, and other popular development environments to collect rich, multi-modal feedback during normal coding activities. The feedback collection system will capture:

**Explicit Feedback:**
- Direct acceptance/rejection of suggestions (binary feedback)
- Modification patterns of accepted suggestions (edit distance and transformation operations)
- Voice commands and reactions (using speech-to-text processing)
- UI-based controls for adjusting suggestion parameters (e.g., risk tolerance, creativity level)

**Implicit Feedback:**
- Time spent reviewing suggestions before acceptance/rejection
- Hover patterns and cursor movements around suggestions
- Context switches following suggestion presentation
- Code editing patterns preceding suggestion requests

The data collection system will be designed with privacy preservation as a priority. All data will be processed locally when possible, and users will have granular control over what information is shared. Additionally, we will implement techniques such as differential privacy to protect sensitive information while maintaining utility for personalization.

The plugin architecture will include:
```
CodeAssistantPlugin
├── FeedbackCollector
│   ├── ExplicitFeedbackModule
│   └── ImplicitFeedbackModule
├── ModelInterface
│   ├── LocalModelConnector
│   └── RemoteAPIConnector
├── UserPreferenceManager
└── PrivacyController
```

### 2. Online Personalization Algorithms

We will develop novel algorithms for rapidly adapting model behavior based on streaming user feedback. Our approach will integrate several techniques:

**User Style Representation Learning:**
We will represent each user's coding style as a learnable embedding vector $\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ that captures syntactic and semantic preferences. This embedding will be initialized from a clustering of common programming styles and refined through interaction.

The user embedding will be updated using stochastic gradient descent:

$$\mathbf{u}_{t+1} = \mathbf{u}_t - \eta \nabla_{\mathbf{u}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{u}_t, f_t)$$

where $\eta$ is the learning rate, $\mathcal{L}$ is a loss function measuring alignment between user preferences and feedback $f_t$ at time $t$.

**Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation:**
We will employ model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to enable rapid personalization from limited user feedback. The meta-learning objective is:

$$\min_\theta \sum_{i=1}^N \mathcal{L}(\theta_i', \mathcal{D}_i^{val})$$

where $\theta_i' = \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta, \mathcal{D}_i^{train})$

This allows the model to quickly adapt to new users based on a few interactions, leveraging patterns learned across the user population.

**Contextual Bandit Learning:**
To balance exploration of new suggestion types with exploitation of known user preferences, we will implement a contextual bandit framework. For each suggestion type $a \in \mathcal{A}$ in context $\mathbf{x}$, we estimate the expected reward (user satisfaction) as:

$$Q(\mathbf{x}, a) = \mathbf{x}^T W_a \mathbf{u} + b_a$$

where $W_a$ and $b_a$ are learnable parameters. Suggestions are selected using an upper confidence bound approach:

$$a_t = \arg\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} (Q(\mathbf{x}_t, a) + c\sqrt{\frac{\ln(t)}{N_a(t)}})$$

where $N_a(t)$ is the number of times action $a$ has been taken up to time $t$, and $c$ controls exploration.

**Memory-Augmented Personalization:**
To capture longer-term preferences and handle concept drift in user behavior, we will implement a memory module that stores exemplar interactions. The memory $\mathcal{M} = \{(x_i, a_i, r_i)\}_{i=1}^M$ consists of context-action-reward tuples.

When making predictions, the model queries this memory using attention:

$$\alpha_i = \frac{\exp(s(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}_i))}{\sum_{j=1}^M \exp(s(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}_j))}$$

$$\hat{y} = f_\theta(\mathbf{x}, \sum_{i=1}^M \alpha_i \mathbf{v}_i)$$

where $s$ is a similarity function, $\mathbf{v}_i$ is a value vector derived from $(a_i, r_i)$, and $f_\theta$ is the prediction function.

### 3. Experimental Design and Evaluation

We will conduct both controlled laboratory studies and real-world deployments to evaluate our approach. The evaluation will be conducted in three phases:

**Phase 1: Controlled Laboratory Evaluation**
We will recruit 50 professional developers with varying experience levels to complete a set of standardized programming tasks in both a personalized and non-personalized condition. Measurements will include:

1. **Task Completion Time**: Time to complete standardized programming tasks
2. **Code Quality Metrics**: Cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index, and other static analysis metrics
3. **Suggestion Acceptance Rate**: Percentage of AI suggestions accepted
4. **Suggestion Modification Effort**: Edit distance between suggested code and final code
5. **Cognitive Load**: NASA Task Load Index (TLX) self-reporting

**Phase 2: Longitudinal Field Study**
We will deploy our system to 100 developers for a 12-week period in their everyday work environments. Data collection will include:
1. **Daily Usage Patterns**: Frequency and contexts of assistant invocation
2. **Learning Curve**: Changes in interaction patterns over time
3. **Personalization Efficacy**: Improvements in suggestion relevance over time
4. **User Satisfaction**: Weekly surveys and semi-structured interviews
5. **System Interventions**: Frequency and nature of explicit corrections/guidance

**Phase 3: Ablation Studies**
To understand the contribution of different components of our system, we will conduct ablation studies removing individual elements (e.g., implicit feedback, meta-learning, memory module) and measuring the impact on performance.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
For quantitative evaluation, we will define a comprehensive set of metrics:

1. **Suggestion Relevance Score (SRS)**:
   $$\text{SRS} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (1 - \text{normalized\_edit\_distance}(s_i, f_i))$$
   where $s_i$ is the suggested code and $f_i$ is the final code after user edits.

2. **Personalization Gain (PG)**:
   $$\text{PG} = \frac{\text{SRS}_{\text{personalized}} - \text{SRS}_{\text{generic}}}{\text{SRS}_{\text{generic}}}$$

3. **Time Efficiency Improvement (TEI)**:
   $$\text{TEI} = \frac{\text{Time}_{\text{baseline}} - \text{Time}_{\text{with\_assistant}}}{\text{Time}_{\text{baseline}}}$$

4. **User Satisfaction Index (USI)**:
   A composite score derived from survey responses on a 7-point Likert scale covering aspects like perceived helpfulness, frustration levels, and trust.

5. **Learning Rate (LR)**:
   $$\text{LR} = \frac{d(\text{SRS})}{dt}$$
   The rate of improvement in suggestion relevance over time.
