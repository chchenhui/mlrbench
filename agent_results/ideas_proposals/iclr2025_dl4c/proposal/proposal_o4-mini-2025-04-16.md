Title  
‚ÄúHuman-AI Co-Adaptation Loops for Personalized Code Assistants‚Äù

1. Introduction  
Background  
Deep learning‚Äìbased code assistants (e.g., OpenAI Codex, CodeGen, Code-LLAMA) have demonstrated remarkable zero- and few-shot performance on tasks ranging from code completion to bug fixing. Yet these models remain largely static: once deployed, they provide generic suggestions that poorly align with individual developers‚Äô coding styles, habitual workflows, or domain‚Äêspecific patterns. Prior efforts in personalization‚ÄîMPCODER‚Äôs contrastive style embeddings (Dai et al. 2024), PERS‚Äôs learning‚Äêstyle simulator (Liu et al. 2024), and CodingGenie‚Äôs customizable suggestions (Zhao et al. 2025)‚Äîeither operate offline or require extensive user data and retraining. Meanwhile, HCI work (Holter & El-Assady 2024; Chen et al. 2024) underscores the importance of seamless, in-situ feedback channels for effective human‚ÄìAI collaboration.  

Research Objectives  
We aim to develop and evaluate a ‚Äúhuman‚ÄêAI co-adaptation loop‚Äù framework for personalized code assistants that:  
1. Continuously learns from lightweight, multi-modal user feedback (in situ edits, explicit UI signals, voice commands).  
2. Updates a base LLM in real time via online and meta-learning methods (e.g., MAML, LoRA).  
3. Provides users with direct controls to steer assistant behavior and interpret model adaptations.  
4. Evaluates impact on code correctness, developer productivity, and perceived alignment under realistic IDE settings.  

Significance  
By integrating principles from deep learning for code, software engineering, and HCI, this research addresses core challenges in the DL4C workshop call: (1) agentic methods for programming tasks through adaptive assistants, (2) post-training/alignment via human and execution feedback, (3) developer productivity/HCI through in-situ interactions, (4) open science by releasing code and data, and (5) benchmarking by designing new evaluation protocols. The project promises both theoretical advances in meta-learning for code and practical tools to transform everyday coding workflows.  

2. Methodology  
Our methodology comprises four pillars: (A) Data Collection and Instrumentation, (B) Adaptive Model Architecture, (C) Online and Meta-Learning Algorithms, and (D) Experimental Design and Evaluation.

A. Data Collection and Instrumentation  
1. IDE Plug-in Design  
   ‚Ä¢ We implement a plugin for VSCode and JetBrains IDEs capable of capturing:  
     ‚Äì Code context $C_t$: preceding $k$ lines of code and AST features.  
     ‚Äì Model suggestion $S_t$: token sequence proposed by the LLM.  
     ‚Äì User feedback signals:  
       ‚Ä¢ Implicit: code edits $E_t$ measured via token‚Äêlevel diff.  
       ‚Ä¢ Explicit: UI buttons (üëç/üëé), sliders for ‚Äúverbosity‚Äù or ‚Äúsafety,‚Äù or voice commands.  
     ‚Äì Execution feedback: test‚Äêcase pass/fail outcomes.  
   ‚Ä¢ All user data are locally stored and streamed to a secure backend with end‚Äêto‚Äêend encryption.

2. Privacy and Ethical Safeguards  
   ‚Ä¢ To preserve developer privacy, we integrate local differential privacy (‚Ñì‚ÄêDP) using DP-SGD (Abadi et al., 2016). For each gradient $\nabla\ell_i(\theta)$ computed on user data, we clip and add Gaussian noise:  
     $$
       \bar g = \frac{1}{b}\sum_{i=1}^b \mathrm{clip}(\nabla\ell_i(\theta), C) + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 C^2 I).
     $$  
   ‚Ä¢ Users can opt in/out of various data‚Äêsharing levels; no raw code leaves the user‚Äôs machine without consent.

B. Adaptive Model Architecture  
1. Base LLM  
   ‚Ä¢ We build on a pre-trained code LLM (e.g., Code-LLAMA-7B), parameterized by $\theta_0$.  

2. Personalization via LoRA and Meta‚ÄêParameters  
   ‚Ä¢ We attach a lightweight LoRA adapter matrix $A_u \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times r}$, $B_u \in \mathbb{R}^{r\times d}$ for each user $u$. During inference, the adapted weights are  
     $$
       W' = W + A_u B_u.
     $$  
   ‚Ä¢ We maintain a meta-parameters $\phi$ for fast adaptation across users. The inner‚Äêloop update for user $u$ at time $t$ is:  
     $$
       A_u^{t+1},B_u^{t+1} \leftarrow A_u^t,B_u^t - \alpha \nabla_{A_u,B_u}\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{user}(A_u^t,B_u^t; \mathcal{D}_t),
     $$  
     and the outer‚Äêloop meta‚Äêupdate:  
     $$
       \phi \leftarrow \phi - \beta \sum_u \nabla_\phi \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{meta}(A_u^{T_u}(\phi)),
     $$  
     where $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{user}$ includes cross‚Äêentropy on corrected code plus penalty terms, and $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{meta}$ encourages rapid adaptation.

3. Feedback Modeling and Reward  
   ‚Ä¢ We train a small reward model $R_\psi(C_t, S_t, F_t)$ to map context, suggestion, and user feedback $F_t$ to a scalar reward $r_t$.  
   ‚Ä¢ $R_\psi$ is trained on pairs $\{(C,S), r\}$ where $r$ is derived from execution results (pass=+1, fail=‚àí1), edit‚Äêdistance improvement, and explicit thumbs‚Äêup/down.  

C. Online and Meta-Learning Algorithms  
1. Online Update Loop  
   For each interaction $(C_t,S_t,F_t)$:  
   a. Compute immediate loss $\ell_t = -R_\psi(C_t,S_t,F_t)$.  
   b. Update LoRA parameters via SGD with DP:  
      $$
        A_u^{t+1},B_u^{t+1} \leftarrow A_u^t,B_u^t - \eta \nabla_{A_u,B_u}\ell_t + \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 I).
      $$  
2. Meta-Learning Schedule  
   ‚Ä¢ After every $N$ interactions, perform meta‚Äêupdate of $\phi$ (outer loop) using collected trajectories across users to minimize $ \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{meta} $.  

3. Pseudocode  
```
Initialize base weights Œ∏0, meta-params œÜ, adapter matrices {Au,Bu}=0
for user u in Participants:
  for t in 1‚Ä¶T:
    Ct ‚Üê capture_context(u)
    St ‚àº Model(Ct; Œ∏0 + AuBu)
    Ft ‚Üê collect_feedback(Ct,St)
    rt ‚Üê Rœà(Ct,St,Ft)
    ‚Ñìt ‚Üê -rt + Œª||Au,Bu||^2
    Au,Bu ‚Üê DP-SGD_update(Au,Bu,‚àá‚Ñìt)
    if t mod N == 0:
      œÜ ‚Üê œÜ ‚àí Œ≤ ‚àëu ‚àáœÜ Lmeta(Au(œÜ),Bu(œÜ))
```

D. Long-Term Vision  
This project paves the way for truly agentic code assistants that dynamically evolve with their users. In the long run, we envision an ecosystem of modular adapters that can be shared, fine-tuned, and composed‚Äîenabling communities of developers to benefit from collective learning while preserving individual workflows and privacy. Such adaptive assistants could transform pair programming, education, code review, and large‚Äêscale software maintenance.
