# Contrastive Goal-State Alignment for Sample-Efficient Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction

Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) represents a promising paradigm for teaching agents to achieve diverse objectives without manually engineered reward functions. Instead of learning a policy to maximize a scalar reward signal, GCRL agents learn to reach arbitrary goal states specified by the user. This approach offers several advantages: it enables more intuitive specification of desired behaviors through demonstration rather than mathematical reward engineering; it facilitates transfer learning across related tasks; and it allows for compositional learning of complex behaviors by chaining together goal-reaching policies.

Despite these benefits, current GCRL methods face significant challenges that limit their practical application. First, goal-conditioned policies must operate in sparse reward environments where feedback is only provided upon reaching the goal state, making credit assignment difficult. Second, GCRL agents typically require extensive training data, particularly in complex domains like robotic manipulation or molecular design. Third, most approaches fail to leverage the rich relational structure between goals and intermediate states, treating the goal simply as an additional input to the policy rather than exploiting the geometric and semantic relationships in the underlying state space.

Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have demonstrated remarkable success in learning meaningful representations from unlabeled data across domains including computer vision, natural language processing, and graph neural networks. The key insight from SSL is that data itself contains rich structural information that can be leveraged through carefully designed pretext tasks, such as contrastive learning, which pulls together semantically similar examples while pushing apart dissimilar ones.

This research proposes a novel framework that bridges GCRL with self-supervised representation learning to address these limitations. Our approach, Contrastive Goal-State Alignment (CGSA), leverages the complementary strengths of both paradigms: the sample efficiency and representation quality of contrastive learning, and the flexibility and generalizability of goal-conditioned policies. CGSA employs a hierarchical attention-based architecture to capture both local and global dependencies between states and goals, using a context-aware contrastive objective that explicitly models temporal relationships in successful goal-reaching trajectories.

The significance of this research is threefold. First, we advance the theoretical understanding of how representation learning and reinforcement learning can be integrated in a principled manner. Second, we introduce a practical algorithm that significantly improves sample efficiency and generalization capabilities in GCRL. Third, we demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in both continuous control domains (robotic manipulation) and discrete action spaces (molecular design), showcasing its versatility across application domains.

Our work directly addresses several key questions posed in the GCRL workshop. It explores the connections between GCRL and representation learning, showing how effective representation learning can emerge from goal-conditioned tasks. It addresses limitations of existing methods by incorporating hierarchical abstractions and contrastive objectives. Finally, it demonstrates how these improved techniques can enable applications to broader domains beyond the traditional focus areas of GCRL.

## Methodology

Our methodology consists of two integrated components: (1) a self-supervised goal-state representation learning module that captures the relational structure between goals and intermediate states, and (2) a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages these learned representations to efficiently learn policies for arbitrary goals. We detail each component below.

### 3.1 Self-Supervised Goal-State Representation Learning

The representation learning module aims to learn an embedding space where distances between state and goal embeddings correspond to meaningful progress toward goals. We employ a hierarchical attention-based encoder architecture coupled with a context-aware contrastive learning objective.

#### 3.1.1 Hierarchical Attention Encoder

Let $s_t \in \mathcal{S}$ denote a state at time $t$, and $g \in \mathcal{G}$ a goal state. We define two encoder networks:
- A state encoder $f_θ: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ that maps states to $d$-dimensional embeddings
- A goal encoder $h_φ: \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ that maps goals to the same embedding space

The hierarchical attention encoder processes state and goal information at multiple levels of abstraction. Given a sequence of states $\{s_t, s_{t+1}, ..., s_{t+k}\}$ and a goal $g$, the encoder first computes low-level features:

$$z_{s_i} = f_θ(s_i), \quad z_g = h_φ(g)$$

These embeddings are then processed through a multi-head attention mechanism to capture dependencies between states and goals:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d}}\right)V$$

where $Q$ (queries), $K$ (keys), and $V$ (values) are linear projections of the embeddings. The attention mechanism is applied hierarchically:

1. **Local Attention**: Captures relationships between consecutive states
   $$H_{\text{local}} = \text{MultiHead}(Z_s, Z_s, Z_s)$$

2. **Goal-State Attention**: Captures relationships between states and the goal
   $$H_{\text{goal}} = \text{MultiHead}(Z_s, z_g, z_g)$$

3. **Global Integration**: Integrates local and goal-specific information
   $$H_{\text{final}} = \text{MLP}([H_{\text{local}}; H_{\text{goal}}])$$

where $Z_s = [z_{s_t}, z_{s_{t+1}}, ..., z_{s_{t+k}}]$ and $[;]$ denotes concatenation.

#### 3.1.2 Context-Aware Contrastive Loss

The key innovation in our approach is a context-aware contrastive loss that explicitly accounts for the temporal progress toward goals. Traditional contrastive losses treat all negative examples equally, but in GCRL, states that are temporally closer to the goal should be treated differently from those that are far from it.

For a batch of trajectories, we define positive pairs as (state, goal) pairs from successful trajectories, and negative pairs as (state, goal) pairs from different trajectories. Our context-aware contrastive loss is defined as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \log \frac{\exp(s_i^T g_i / \tau)}{\exp(s_i^T g_i / \tau) + \sum_{j \neq i} \exp(s_i^T g_j / \tau) \cdot w(s_i, g_j)}$$

where $\tau$ is a temperature parameter and $w(s_i, g_j)$ is a weighting function that accounts for the estimated distance between state $s_i$ and goal $g_j$:

$$w(s_i, g_j) = \exp\left(-\alpha \cdot d_{\text{est}}(s_i, g_j)\right)$$

Here, $d_{\text{est}}$ is an estimated distance (e.g., number of steps) between a state and a goal, and $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter that controls the sensitivity to distance.

Additionally, we introduce a temporal consistency loss that ensures embeddings of states along successful trajectories exhibit smooth progression toward the goal:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{temp}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \max(0, d(z_{s_{i,t+1}}, z_{g_i}) - d(z_{s_{i,t}}, z_{g_i}) + \beta)$$

where $d$ is a distance function (e.g., Euclidean distance) in the embedding space, and $\beta$ is a margin parameter.

The total representation learning loss is a weighted combination:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{repr}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}} + \lambda_{\text{temp}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{temp}}$$

### 3.2 Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning

The second component of our framework is a GCRL algorithm that leverages the learned representations. We build upon Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), a state-of-the-art RL algorithm known for its sample efficiency and stability, extending it to incorporate our learned representations.

#### 3.2.1 Goal-Conditioned Soft Actor-Critic

In standard SAC, the objective is to learn a policy that maximizes expected return while also maximizing entropy. We adapt this to the goal-conditioned setting by defining the Q-function as $Q(s, a, g)$, representing the expected return when taking action $a$ in state $s$ to reach goal $g$.

The key modification is to compute the Q-values using our learned representations:

$$Q(s, a, g) = Q_\psi([z_s; z_g], a)$$

where $[z_s; z_g]$ is the concatenation of the state and goal embeddings from our representation learning module, and $Q_\psi$ is a neural network parameterized by $\psi$.

The policy is similarly conditioned on the learned representations:

$$\pi_\omega(a|s,g) = \pi_\omega(a|[z_s; z_g])$$

The goal-conditioned SAC objective becomes:

$$J(\omega) = \mathbb{E}_{s,g \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_\omega(a|s,g)} \left[ Q_\psi(s, a, g) - \alpha \log \pi_\omega(a|s,g) \right] \right]$$

where $\mathcal{D}$ is a replay buffer of past experiences, and $\alpha$ is a temperature parameter that controls the tradeoff between maximizing returns and entropy.

#### 3.2.2 Hierarchical Goal Generation and Hindsight Experience Replay

To further improve sample efficiency, we incorporate hierarchical goal generation and hindsight experience replay (HER) techniques.

**Hierarchical Goal Generation**: Our approach generates subgoals at multiple time scales to facilitate learning of complex behaviors. Using the learned representations, we identify clusters of states in the embedding space and select centroids as candidate subgoals. These subgoals are then used to train a hierarchical policy:

1. A high-level policy $\pi_{\text{high}}(g_{\text{sub}}|s,g)$ that selects subgoals $g_{\text{sub}}$ given the current state $s$ and final goal $g$.
2. A low-level policy $\pi_{\text{low}}(a|s,g_{\text{sub}})$ that selects actions to reach the subgoal.

The high-level policy operates at a lower frequency (e.g., every $k$ steps) than the low-level policy, which selects actions at every step.

**Enhanced Hindsight Experience Replay**: We extend HER by leveraging our learned representations to select more informative goals for relabeling. Given a trajectory $(s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, ..., s_T)$ that was attempting to reach goal $g$ but failed, traditional HER randomly selects future states from the trajectory as alternative goals. We improve upon this by selecting states that maximize information gain in the representation space:

$$g_{\text{relabel}} = \arg\max_{s_t \in \{s_k, k>i\}} I(z_{s_t}; z_g | z_{s_i})$$

where $I$ is the mutual information. In practice, we approximate this by selecting states that are diverse in the embedding space and also make progress toward the original goal.

### 3.3 Experimental Design

To evaluate our approach, we design experiments in both continuous control and discrete action domains, focusing on sparse-reward settings where traditional RL methods struggle.

#### 3.3.1 Continuous Control Domain: Meta-World

Meta-World is a benchmark of 50 robotic manipulation tasks, including reaching, pushing, door opening, and tool use. We evaluate our method on both single-task and multi-task learning scenarios:

1. **Single-Task Learning**: We select 10 representative tasks from Meta-World and train our algorithm on each task independently, comparing its sample efficiency and success rate against baseline methods (SAC, GCRL, HER, LEAP).

2. **Multi-Task Learning**: We train a single model on all 50 Meta-World tasks simultaneously, evaluating its ability to transfer knowledge across tasks and generalize to new goal configurations.

3. **Zero-Shot Transfer**: After training on a subset of tasks, we evaluate the model's ability to solve new tasks without additional training by specifying appropriate goals.

#### 3.3.2 Discrete Action Domain: Molecular Generation

For molecular generation, we use the ZINC database of commercially available compounds and the MolGym environment, which provides a reinforcement learning interface for molecular design. The goal is to generate molecules with specified properties (e.g., solubility, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness).

1. **Property Optimization**: Given a target set of molecular properties, the agent must generate molecules that optimize these properties.

2. **Scaffold-Based Generation**: Given a molecular scaffold, the agent must complete the molecule to satisfy specified property constraints.

3. **Cross-Domain Transfer**: We evaluate whether representations learned from one molecular property optimization task transfer to other property optimization tasks.

#### 3.3.3 Evaluation Metrics

We employ the following metrics to evaluate our approach:

1. **Sample Efficiency**: Number of environment interactions required to reach a specified success rate.

2. **Success Rate**: Percentage of episodes in which the agent successfully reaches the goal.

3. **Generalization Performance**: Success rate on unseen goal configurations.

4. **Representation Quality**:
   - Alignment between state and goal embeddings for corresponding (state, goal) pairs
   - Separation between embeddings of unrelated (state, goal) pairs
   - Smoothness of the learned representation space

5. **Ablation Studies**: We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each component:
   - Hierarchical attention vs. simple encoders
   - Context-aware contrastive loss vs. standard contrastive loss
   - Hierarchical goal generation vs. flat policies
   - Enhanced HER vs. standard HER

The context-aware contrastive approach is expected to substantially improve sample efficiency by capturing the relational structure between goals and states, enabling more effective generalization across tasks. The hierarchical attention architecture will provide a principled way to model both local and global dependencies in sequential decision-making, facilitating the learning of complex behaviors from sparse rewards.

The framework is designed to be algorithm-agnostic, meaning that while we implement it with SAC, the representation learning component can be integrated with any goal-conditioned RL algorithm. This flexibility will foster broader adoption and extension by the research community.
