Enhancing Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning through Self-Supervised Goal Representation Learning

## 2. Introduction

### Background

Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) has emerged as a promising approach to learning goal-directed behavior in various domains. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning (RL), where agents learn from explicit reward functions, GCRL allows users to specify desired outcomes with a single observation, making it more flexible and applicable to complex tasks such as robotics, language models tuning, molecular design, and instruction following. However, GCRL faces significant challenges in sparse reward environments and sample inefficiency, particularly in complex domains. Existing methods often ignore the rich relational structure between goals and states, limiting their generalization and adaptability.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to enhance the capabilities of GCRL by integrating self-supervised learning techniques. Specifically, we aim to:
1. Develop a self-supervised module that learns a metric-shared goal-state representation using contrastive learning on diverse experience sequences.
2. Utilize hierarchical attention to encode goals and intermediate states, capturing their relational structure.
3. Implement a context-aware contrastive loss that aligns representations across temporally distant goals, enabling the agent to infer abstract subgoals and transfer policies across tasks.
4. Evaluate the proposed approach in sparse-reward continual-control and discrete-action domains, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and compositional generalization.

### Significance

The proposed method addresses several key challenges in GCRL, including sparse reward environments, sample inefficiency, lack of rich goal-state representations, and transferability across tasks. By integrating self-supervised learning, we aim to create interpretable latent spaces that facilitate causal goal reasoning and accelerate real-world deployment. This research has the potential to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in GCRL, making it more practical and effective for a wide range of applications.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Research Design

The proposed research follows a two-stage framework:

1. **Self-Supervised Goal Representation Learning**:
   - **Data Collection**: Collect diverse experience sequences from various environments and tasks.
   - **Contrastive Learning**: Utilize contrastive learning to learn a shared goal-state representation. The contrastive loss encourages the model to align representations of co-occurring goals and states (positive pairs) while differentiating them from dispreferred ones (negative pairs).
   - **Hierarchical Attention**: Employ hierarchical attention to encode goals and intermediate states, capturing their temporal dependencies and relational structures.

2. **Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning**:
   - **Policy Learning**: Use the learned goal-state representation to compute goal-conditioned Q-values. A GCRL agent (e.g., Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)) utilizes this representation to dynamically relabel goals during replay.
   - **Context-Aware Contrastive Loss**: Implement a context-aware contrastive loss that aligns representations across temporally distant goals, enabling the agent to infer abstract subgoals and transfer policies across tasks.

### 3.2 Algorithmic Steps

#### Stage 1: Self-Supervised Goal Representation Learning

1. **Input**: Diverse experience sequences $\{(s_i, g_i, a_i, r_i, s_{i+1})\}$ from various environments.
2. **Goal and State Encoding**: Encode goals $g_i$ and states $s_i$ using a shared embedding network $f$.
   - $g_i \rightarrow g_i' = f(g_i)$
   - $s_i \rightarrow s_i' = f(s_i)$
3. **Contrastive Learning**:
   - **Positive Pairs**: Select co-occurring goals and states from successful trajectories.
   - **Negative Pairs**: Sample random goals and states from the experience sequences.
   - **Contrastive Loss**:
     \[
     L_{contrastive} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ y_i \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(g_i', s_i'))}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(\text{sim}(g_j', s_j'))} + (1 - y_i) \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(g_i', s_{i+1}'))}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(\text{sim}(g_j', s_{j+1}'))} \right]
     \]
     where $y_i$ is the label (1 for positive pairs, 0 for negative pairs), and $\text{sim}$ is the similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity).
4. **Hierarchical Attention**: Apply hierarchical attention to encode goals and intermediate states, capturing their relational structure.

#### Stage 2: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning

1. **Input**: Goal-state representation $z_i = [g_i', s_i']$ from the self-supervised module.
2. **Goal-Conditioned Q-Learning**:
   - Compute goal-conditioned Q-values using the learned representation:
     \[
     Q(s_i, g_i, a_i) = \mathbb{E}_{s_{i+1} \sim \pi(a_i | s_i, g_i)} [r(s_i, g_i, a_i) + \gamma Q(s_{i+1}, g_{i+1}, a_{i+1})]
     \]
     where $\pi$ is the policy, $r$ is the reward function, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor.
3. **Context-Aware Contrastive Loss**:
   - Align representations of temporally distant goals:
     \[
     L_{context-aware} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ y_i \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(g_i', g_{i+1}'))}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(\text{sim}(g_j', g_{j+1}'))} + (1 - y_i) \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(g_i', g_{i+2}'))}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(\text{sim}(g_j', g_{j+2}'))} \right]
     \]
4. **Policy Optimization**: Use the goal-conditioned Q-values to optimize the policy $\pi$ using SAC or another suitable GCRL algorithm.

### 3.3 Experimental Design

#### Datasets

1. **Meta-World**: A sparse-reward continual-control dataset consisting of various tasks with infrequent rewards.
2. **3D Molecular Generation**: A discrete-action dataset for generating molecular structures, where rewards are sparse and task-specific.

#### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Sample Efficiency**: Measure the number of samples required to achieve a certain performance level.
2. **Compositional Generalization**: Evaluate the ability of the agent to transfer policies across tasks with different goal distributions.
3. **Policy Performance**: Assess the performance of the agent on the target tasks using standard RL metrics (e.g., success rate, average reward).
4. **Interpretability**: Analyze the learned goal representations to ensure they capture meaningful relational structures and facilitate causal goal reasoning.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### 4.1 Expected Outcomes

1. **Improved Sample Efficiency**: The proposed method is expected to significantly reduce the number of samples required to learn effective policies in sparse reward environments.
2. **Enhanced Compositional Generalization**: By learning a shared goal-state representation, the agent should be able to transfer policies across tasks with different goal distributions, demonstrating improved compositional generalization.
3. **Interpretable Latent Spaces**: The hierarchical attention and context-aware contrastive loss should result in interpretable latent spaces that facilitate causal goal reasoning and enhance the agent's adaptability.
4. **Real-World Deployment**: The proposed approach offers practical benefits for real-world deployment, where reward engineering is impractical, and users can specify desired outcomes with a single observation.
