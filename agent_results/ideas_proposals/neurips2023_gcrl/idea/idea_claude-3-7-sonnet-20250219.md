# Goal-Directed Molecular Design with Multi-Objective GCRL

## Motivation
Traditional molecular generation approaches often struggle to create molecules that simultaneously satisfy multiple desired properties (e.g., solubility, synthesizability, and target binding). Current methods typically rely on complex reward functions that require significant domain expertise to formulate. Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) offers a promising alternative by allowing chemists to specify desired molecular properties directly as goals, without needing to design explicit reward functions. This research addresses a critical need in drug discovery and material science for more intuitive and effective molecular design tools.

## Main Idea
We propose a multi-objective GCRL framework for molecular design where goals are specified as desired molecular properties in a continuous property space. The framework employs a hierarchical architecture: a high-level policy determines subgoals in molecular property space, while a low-level policy generates molecular structures that achieve these subgoals. We introduce a novel representation learning component that automatically discovers latent factors controlling molecular properties, enabling efficient goal-directed exploration. The system will incorporate self-supervised pretraining on large molecular databases to learn meaningful relationships between structure and properties. By providing chemists with an intuitive interface to specify molecular design goals directly, our approach aims to accelerate drug discovery and novel material design while making advanced molecular engineering more accessible to domain experts who may lack ML expertise.
