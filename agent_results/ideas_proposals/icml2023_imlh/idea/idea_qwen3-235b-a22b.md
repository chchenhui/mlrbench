**Title:** Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning over Medical Knowledge Graphs for Clinically Aligned Explanations  

**Motivation:**  
Black-box machine learning models limit trust and adoption in healthcare due to their opaque decision-making. Clinicians require explanations that align with well-established medical knowledge to validate predictions. Current methods often fail to connect model outputs to clinical concepts or prioritize patient-specific versus population-level reasoning, risking misinterpretation or bias. Transparent integration of structured medical knowledge with model interpretability is essential to bridge this gap.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a neuro-symbolic framework that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) with medical knowledge graphs (e.g., SNOMED-CT, ICD-10 hierarchies) to generate interpretable reasoning paths for clinical risk predictions. The model uses hierarchical attention mechanisms to identify and ground predictions on subgraphs in the knowledge base, directly linking input data (e.g., lab results, imaging) to clinical logic. Symbolic rules (e.g., diagnostic criteria) are encoded as differentiable constraints during training, ensuring consistency with established medical guidelines. Explanations will be visualized as path-based contributions (e.g., “elevated glucose levels + family history → diabetes prediction via pathways X and Y”). Evaluation metrics will prioritize both technical performance (robustness to distributional shifts) and clinical utility (agreement with expert reviews). This approach aims to improve trust, reduce diagnostic biases, and enable actionable debugging of model decisions.
