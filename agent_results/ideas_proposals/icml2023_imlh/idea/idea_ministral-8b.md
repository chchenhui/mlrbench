### Title: Clinically Aligned Interpretability in Machine Learning for Healthcare

### Motivation:
The lack of interpretability in machine learning models hinders their adoption in healthcare, where trust and reliability are paramount. Existing black-box models often fail to provide insights that clinicians can understand and verify, leading to hesitancy in deploying these systems. To address this, it is crucial to develop interpretable models that align with clinical reasoning and incorporate structured medical knowledge, thereby enhancing trust and facilitating deployment.

### Main Idea:
This research aims to develop a novel framework for Clinically Aligned Interpretability in Machine Learning (CAIM), which integrates medical knowledge graphs and clinical reasoning to enhance the interpretability of healthcare ML models. The proposed methodology includes:

1. **Knowledge Graph Embedding**: Embed medical knowledge graphs into ML models to capture structured clinical information and relationships.
2. **Reasoning-Augmented Models**: Design models that incorporate symbolic reasoning over the knowledge graph to align predictions with clinical logic.
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Develop techniques to quantify and communicate uncertainty in model predictions, aiding in clinical decision-making.
4. **Evaluation Protocols**: Establish metrics to assess the interpretability and clinical relevance of the models, ensuring they meet healthcare standards.

Expected outcomes include more interpretable and trustworthy healthcare ML systems, improved clinical decision support, and enhanced model robustness and generalizability. The potential impact includes broader adoption of ML in healthcare, better patient outcomes, and reduced healthcare costs.
