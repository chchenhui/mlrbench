**Title:** Clinical Pathway-Driven Neural Networks for Transparent Diagnosis Prediction  

**Motivation:** Clinical decision-making relies on structured reasoning guided by medical guidelines and pathways. Current ML models lack explicit alignment with these protocols, reducing trust and interpretability. This research aims to bridge the gap by designing models that mirror clinical workflows, enhancing transparency and facilitating physician validation.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a neural network architecture where each layer corresponds to a step in a clinical pathway (e.g., symptom assessment, lab analysis, differential diagnosis). Medical knowledge graphs will constrain layer connections and parameters to reflect guideline-based decisions. For instance, attention modules could highlight relevant lab results or symptoms at each step, while intermediate outputs represent provisional diagnoses. The model will be trained on electronic health records, with regularization terms enforcing adherence to pathway logic. Outcomes include quantifiable alignment with clinical guidelines (via similarity metrics against expert annotations) and improved interpretability (validated through clinician surveys). This approach could reduce biases by grounding predictions in established protocols and enable debugging via pathway step tracing, accelerating real-world adoption.
