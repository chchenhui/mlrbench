# Knowledge-Infused Graph Networks for Interpretable and Uncertainty-Aware Diagnosis

## 1. Introduction

### Background  
Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated transformative potential in healthcare, enabling early disease detection, precision medicine, and personalized treatment planning. However, the deployment of ML models in clinical settings remains hindered by two critical challenges: **interpretability** and **uncertainty quantification**. Traditional black-box models, such as deep neural networks, often fail to justify their predictions through mechanisms aligned with clinical reasoning, eroding trust among healthcare practitioners. Simultaneously, the absence of reliable uncertainty estimates—particularly in high-stakes decisions like cancer diagnosis or critical care monitoring—poses risks when models are applied to out-of-distribution or ambiguous cases.  

The integration of **medical knowledge graphs (KGs)** offers a pathway to address these challenges. KGs encode structured relationships between biomedical entities (e.g., genes, symptoms, diseases, drugs), providing a scaffold for learning representations grounded in expert-curated knowledge. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which naturally operate on relational data, offer a mechanism to propagate information across KG topologies while leveraging patient-specific data (e.g., electronic health records, imaging features) for diagnosis. However, existing GNNs in healthcare face limitations:  
1. **Insufficient interpretability**: Attention mechanisms in GNNs often fail to highlight clinically meaningful pathways, limiting their utility for physicians.  
2. **Poormodeling of uncertainty**: Predictive uncertainties (epistemic, arising from data limitations; aleatoric, from inherent noise) are rarely disentangled, leading to overconfident or underconfident predictions.  
3. **Robustness to noisy data**: Missing or noisy observations in EHRs frequently degrade model performance without compensatory uncertainty signals.  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop **Knowledge-Infused Graph Networks (KIGNet)**, a novel framework combining GNNs, domain-specific KGs, and uncertainty quantification to address these challenges. The objectives are:  
1. **Interpretable Diagnosis via Knowledge-Driven Propagation**: Integrate a medical KG (e.g., SNOMED-CT, Gene Ontology) into a GNN architecture using attention mechanisms that explicitly highlight salient biomedical entities and relationships during prediction.  
2. **Uncertainty Quantification with Disentanglement**: Incorporate evidential deep learning or conformal prediction methods within the GNN to quantify and disentangle aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, providing calibrated confidence scores for diagnostic decisions.  
3. **Validation for Clinical Utility**: Evaluate the framework on diverse diagnostic tasks (e.g., diabetic retinopathy classification, cancer subtyping) using clinical datasets, focusing on accuracy, interpretability (via clinician feedback), and reliability under distributional shifts.  

### Significance  
KIGNet advances the field of explainable AI (XAI) in healthcare by bridging the gap between complex ML models and clinical practice. By aligning representations with established medical knowledge, the framework ensures that diagnostic rationales adhere to biological plausibility, fostering clinician trust. Additionally, explicit uncertainty signaling helps avoid high-risk decisions when evidence is ambiguous (e.g., distinguishing lung cancer vs. tuberculosis in radiographs). This work directly addresses the NIH’s goals for trustworthy AI and has potential applications in safety-critical domains like radiology, genomics, and chronic disease management.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
**Datasets**:  
- **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)**: MIMIC-IV, Cerner Real-World Data (de-identified patient records containing diagnoses, lab results, medications).  
- **Imaging Data**: NIH ChestX-ray14 (chest radiographs with multi-label annotations).  
- **Genetic Data**: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for multi-omics features in cancer subtyping.  
- **Synthetic Data**: Generate adversarial examples and noisy instances to benchmark robustness.  

**KG Construction**:  
- **Biomedical KGs**: Leverage SNOMED-CT (clinical concepts), MeSH (medical subject headings), and Gene Ontology (GO) to model relationships between diseases, treatments, and biological markers.  
- **Knowledge Embedding**: Use TransE to precompute $d$-dimensional embeddings $\{h_e\}_{e \in \mathcal{E}}$ for entities $\mathcal{E}$, ensuring compatibility with GNN propagation.  

**Patient Graph Construction**:  
- For each patient, map EHR variables (e.g., "elevated glucose" = yes/no) and imaging features (e.g., deep learning-derived lesion attributes) to KG nodes. Let $\mathcal{G}_p = (\mathcal{V}_p, \mathcal{E}_p)$ denote the patient graph, where $\mathcal{V}_p \subseteq \mathcal{V}_{\text{KG}}$ includes nodes present in the patient’s data.  

### 2.2 Interpretable GNN Architecture  
**Graph Attention Propagation**:  
We employ a two-layer **Graph Attention Network (GAT)** to learn node representations:  

1. **First Layer**:  
$$
h'_i = \sigma\left( \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \alpha_{ij} \cdot W_1 h_j \right),
$$
where $W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ is a weight matrix, $\sigma$ is LeakyReLU, and $\alpha_{ij}$ is the attention coefficient between nodes $i$ and $j$:  
$$
\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp(\text{LeakyReLU}(a^T [W_1 h_i \| W_1 h_j]))}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \exp(\text{LeakyReLU}(a^T [W_1 h_i \| W_1 h_k]))}
$$
Here, $a \in \mathbb{R}^{2d}$ and $\|$ denotes concatenation.  

2. **Second Layer**:  
$$
h''_i = \text{ELU}\left( \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \beta_{ij} \cdot W_2 h'_j \right),
$$
with $\beta_{ij}$ computed similarly using a learnable vector $b \in \mathbb{R}^{2d}$.  

**Interpretability Mechanism**:  
- Normalize attention scores $\alpha_{ij}$ and $\beta_{ij}$ to identify high-weight edges during prediction.  
- Visualize the most influential subgraph (e.g., "elevated glucose" → "diabetic retinopathy") for a given diagnosis.  

**Uncertainty Quantification**:  
**Option A: Evidential Learning**  
Introduce an evidential output layer that estimates Dirichlet parameters $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_C)$ for $C$-class classification:  
$$
\boldsymbol{\alpha} = \text{Softplus}(W_{evi} h''_{\text{root}}),
$$
where $h''_{\text{root}}$ is the representation for the diagnosis node. Use the log-likelihood loss from evidential deep learning:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{evi} = \sum_{c=1}^C \left[ (y_c - \alpha_c) \cdot \log(\alpha_c) + \beta_{\text{KL}} \cdot D_{\text{KL}}(\text{Dir}(\boldsymbol{\alpha} \| y)) \right].
$$  
**Option B: Conformal Prediction**  
Apply the CF-GNN framework to construct $(1-\alpha)$-coverage prediction sets:  
1. Split the training set into proper training (~80%) and calibration (~20%) subsets.  
2. For each sample in the calibration set, compute nonconformity scores $s_i = 1 - p_{\text{pred}}(y_i)$, where $p_{pred}$ is the softmax probability.  
3. For a new sample $x_{n+1}$, define the prediction set $\Gamma^\epsilon = \{y | s(x_{n+1}, y) \leq Q_{1-\alpha}(s_i)\}$, ensuring $P(y_{n+1} \in \Gamma^\epsilon) \geq 1-\alpha$.  

### 2.3 Training and Evaluation  

**Loss Functions**:  
The total loss combines classification accuracy, evidence calibration, and attention sparsity:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}} + \lambda_{\text{evi}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{evi}} + \lambda_{\text{sparsity}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{sparsity}},
$$
where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{sparsity}} = \sum_{i,j} \| \beta_{ij} \cdot W_2 h'_j \|$ promotes sparse attention.  

**Baselines**:  
1. **GNN-agnostic Models**: XGBoost, Deep Patient with SHAP explanations.  
2. **KG-aware Models**: GCN, GAT, and GPRGNN without uncertainty modules.  
3. **Interpretable-Only**: GNNExplainer applied to GPRGNN.  
4. **Uncertainty-Only**: MC-Dropout with GAT.  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
1. **Diagnostics**: Accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC.  
2. **Interpretability**:  
   - Concordance between attention pathways and expert-reviewed clinical guidelines (e.g., Jaccard index).  
   - Faithfulness and sensitivity scores for explanation quality.  
3. **Uncertainty**:  
   - Brier score, negative log-likelihood (NLL).  
   - Coverage and prediction set size for conformal methods.  
4. **Robustness**: Ablation studies with noisy features (e.g., accuracy drop vs. uncertainty increase).
