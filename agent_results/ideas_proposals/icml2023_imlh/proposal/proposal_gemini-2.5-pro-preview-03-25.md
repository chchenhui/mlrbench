**Knowledge-Infused Graph Networks for Interpretable and Uncertainty-Aware Medical Diagnosis**

## 2. Introduction

**2.1. Background**
The integration of Machine Learning (ML) into healthcare holds transformative potential, promising enhanced diagnostic accuracy, personalized treatment strategies, and streamlined clinical workflows. From analyzing medical images to predicting disease progression from Electronic Health Records (EHRs), ML models are increasingly demonstrating capabilities that rival or even surpass human experts in specific tasks. However, a significant barrier to the widespread clinical adoption of these powerful tools is their inherent "black-box" nature. Many state-of-the-art ML models, particularly deep learning architectures, provide predictions without clear, understandable justifications for their reasoning process. This lack of transparency hinders clinician trust, makes it difficult to verify model outputs against established medical knowledge, and raises safety concerns, especially in high-stakes clinical decision-making environments where errors can have severe consequences (Task Description; Lit Review: 7).

Interpretability and reliability are therefore paramount. Clinicians need diagnostic aids that not only predict accurately but also explain *why* a particular diagnosis is suggested, ideally referencing underlying medical knowledge and principles familiar to practitioners (Lit Review: 7). Furthermore, these systems must recognize their own limitations and reliably indicate *when* they are uncertain about a prediction. Quantifying uncertainty is crucial for safe deployment, allowing clinicians to appropriately weigh the model's suggestion based on its confidence and the nature of its uncertainty â€“ whether it stems from insufficient patient data (aleatoric uncertainty) or limitations in the model's knowledge (epistemic uncertainty) (Task Description; Lit Review: 6).

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling relational data, making them well-suited for healthcare applications where data is often interconnected (e.g., patient histories, biological networks, medical ontologies) (Lit Review: 5). Concurrently, Medical Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide structured representations of complex medical knowledge, linking concepts like diseases, symptoms, tests, treatments, and genes (Lit Review: 8). Integrating KGs with GNNs offers a promising avenue to develop models whose reasoning processes are inherently grounded in established medical knowledge, thus enhancing interpretability. Combining this with sophisticated uncertainty quantification techniques can address the critical needs for trustworthy AI in healthcare.

**2.2. Research Objectives**
This research aims to develop and evaluate a novel framework, termed Knowledge-Infused Graph Network (KIGNET), specifically designed for interpretable and uncertainty-aware medical diagnosis. The primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Knowledge-Infused GNN Framework:** Design and implement a GNN architecture that explicitly integrates a pre-existing or constructed medical knowledge graph. The model will learn patient representations by propagating information conditioned on the relationships defined within the KG.
2.  **Incorporate Attention Mechanisms for Interpretability:** Integrate graph attention mechanisms within the GNN to identify and quantify the importance of specific medical concepts (nodes) and relationships (edges) in the KG that contribute most significantly to a given diagnostic prediction. This aims to provide explanations aligned with clinical reasoning pathways.
3.  **Integrate Robust Uncertainty Quantification:** Implement and compare state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods (e.g., Evidential Deep Learning, Conformal Prediction) within the KIGNET framework to provide reliable estimates of diagnostic uncertainty, distinguishing between different sources of uncertainty where possible.
4.  **Evaluate Performance, Interpretability, and Uncertainty Calibration:** Rigorously evaluate the proposed KIGNET framework on benchmark medical datasets (e.g., EHR data). The evaluation will encompass predictive accuracy, the quality and clinical relevance of generated explanations, and the calibration and usefulness of the uncertainty estimates.
5.  **Demonstrate Alignment with Clinical Reasoning:** Through case studies and potentially qualitative evaluation with clinicians, assess the extent to which the model's explanations, derived from attention weights over the KG, align with human clinical diagnostic reasoning processes.

**2.3. Significance**
This research directly addresses the critical bottleneck of trust and transparency hindering the adoption of advanced ML in clinical practice. By developing an inherently interpretable model grounded in medical knowledge and equipped with reliable uncertainty awareness, this work offers several significant contributions:

*   **Enhanced Trust and Clinical Utility:** Provides clinicians with a decision support tool that offers not just predictions, but also evidence-based explanations rooted in familiar medical concepts and reliable confidence scores, facilitating safer and more informed clinical decision-making.
*   **Improved Model Reliability and Safety:** Explicit uncertainty quantification allows the system to flag cases where its prediction is unreliable, enabling clinicians to exercise caution or seek further information, thereby increasing patient safety.
*   **Advancement in Interpretable ML for Healthcare:** Contributes a novel methodology combining GNNs, KGs, attention mechanisms, and UQ, specifically tailored for the complexities of medical diagnosis, pushing the boundaries of interpretable and trustworthy AI in healthcare.
*   **Facilitating Regulatory Approval and Deployment:** Models that offer transparency and reliability quantification are more likely to meet regulatory requirements and gain acceptance from healthcare institutions and practitioners.
*   **Bridging ML and Clinical Knowledge:** Provides a concrete framework for integrating structured medical knowledge into deep learning models, moving beyond purely data-driven approaches towards systems that leverage established clinical understanding.

## 3. Methodology

This section details the proposed research design, including data sources, knowledge graph construction, the KIGNET model architecture, interpretability mechanisms, uncertainty quantification techniques, and the experimental validation plan.

**3.1. Data Collection and Preparation**
*   **Primary Data Source:** We will primarily utilize publicly available, large-scale de-identified Electronic Health Record (EHR) datasets such as MIMIC-III or MIMIC-IV. These datasets contain rich longitudinal patient information, including demographics, diagnoses (ICD codes), procedures, medications, laboratory results, clinical notes (requiring NLP preprocessing, e.g., BioBERT, ClinicalBERT), and potentially vital signs.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Standard preprocessing steps will be applied, including data cleaning (handling missing values via imputation or masking), normalization of numerical features, encoding of categorical features, and extraction of relevant clinical concepts (e.g., symptoms, conditions, lab abnormalities) from notes using NLP techniques. Patients will be segmented into encounters or suitable time windows for diagnostic prediction tasks.
*   **Target Task:** The primary task will be diagnostic prediction, such as predicting primary diagnosis codes for a hospital admission based on initial presentation data (e.g., symptoms, demographics, initial labs). Secondary tasks might include predicting complication risks or differential diagnosis ranking.

**3.2. Medical Knowledge Graph (KG) Construction**
*   **Sources:** We will leverage existing large-scale biomedical knowledge graphs and ontologies, such as UMLS (Unified Medical Language System), SNOMED-CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms), DrugBank, Gene Ontology (GO), and potentially disease-specific knowledge bases.
*   **Structure:** The KG will comprise nodes representing medical entities (e.g., diseases, symptoms, findings, laboratory tests, medications, genes) and edges representing relationships between them (e.g., `causes`, `associated_with`, `treats`, `measures`, `indicates`, `is_a`). Entities extracted from EHR data will be mapped to canonical concepts in the KG (e.g., using UMLS Metathesaurus).
*   **Integration:** We will construct a unified graph representation integrating these sources. Challenges include schema alignment, entity resolution, and handling noise or inconsistencies (Lit Review: 4, 8). Techniques for knowledge graph embedding might be used to pre-train node features, capturing semantic similarities.

**3.3. Proposed Model: Knowledge-Infused Graph Network (KIGNET)**

The KIGNET framework integrates patient data with the medical KG for prediction, interpretability, and UQ.

*   **Input Representation:** For each patient encounter, relevant clinical features (e.g., observed symptoms, abnormal lab results) are identified and mapped to corresponding entity nodes in the medical KG. These nodes form the initial state or 'query' nodes within the larger KG structure, perhaps represented by injecting patient-specific feature vectors into these nodes. The model will operate on a relevant subgraph centered around these patient-specific nodes or the entire KG with patient features localized.

*   **GNN Architecture:** We will employ a multi-layer Graph Neural Network. A suitable base architecture like Graph Attention Network (GAT) or Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) will be adapted, as they naturally handle heterogeneous graphs and provide attention mechanisms (Lit Review: 5, 9). The message passing mechanism allows nodes (medical concepts) to iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors in the KG.

    Let $h_v^{(l)}$ be the representation of node $v$ at layer $l$. The update rule can be generally formulated as:
    $$ h_v^{(l+1)} = \sigma \left( \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} \sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}_r(v)} \alpha_{vu}^{(l, r)} W_r^{(l)} h_u^{(l)} + W_0^{(l)} h_v^{(l)} \right) $$
    where $\mathcal{N}_r(v)$ is the set of neighbors of node $v$ under relation type $r$, $W_r^{(l)}$ and $W_0^{(l)}$ are learnable weight matrices for relation $r$ and self-connection at layer $l$, $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function (e.g., ReLU), and $\alpha_{vu}^{(l, r)}$ is the attention weight determining the importance of neighbor $u$ (connected via relation $r$) to node $v$ at layer $l$.

*   **Knowledge Infusion:** The GNN explicitly learns on the structure of the medical KG. Information propagation is constrained by medically meaningful relationships (edges), ensuring that the learned representations are grounded in established knowledge pathways. Different edge types (relations) can be associated with distinct transformation matrices ($W_r$), allowing the model to learn relation-specific semantics.

*   **Interpretability via Attention:** The attention weights $\alpha_{vu}^{(l, r)}$ (Lit Review: 4, 9) computed during message passing serve as the basis for interpretability. High attention weights indicate that specific neighboring concepts $u$ and relations $r$ were deemed important for updating the representation of concept $v$. By aggregating and tracing these attention weights from the patient's initial query nodes towards the final prediction layer (e.g., disease nodes), we can construct an explanation subgraph highlighting the most salient medical concepts and relationships driving the diagnostic prediction. Visualization techniques will be employed to present these explanation subgraphs to users.

*   **Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) Module:** We will implement and compare two primary UQ approaches integrated into the KIGNET framework:

    1.  **Evidential Deep Learning (EDL):** Inspired by Dempster-Shafer theory and Subjective Logic (Lit Review: 2, 6). The final layer of the GNN is modified to output parameters (e.g., 'evidence' or 'concentration' parameters $\alpha_k > 0$) of a Dirichlet distribution over the categorical distribution of possible diagnoses. Let $\mathbf{\alpha} = (\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_K)$ for $K$ diagnostic classes. The predicted probability for class $k$ is $p_k = \alpha_k / S$, where $S = \sum_{i=1}^K \alpha_i$ is the total evidence.
        *   *Epistemic Uncertainty (Model Uncertainty):* Quantified by the total evidence $S$. Low $S$ indicates high epistemic uncertainty (lack of evidence). Vacuity can be measured as $U_{vacuity} = K / S$.
        *   *Aleatoric Uncertainty (Data Uncertainty):* Reflected in the distribution of evidence across classes. Dissonance (conflict) can be measured based on the relative evidence values.
        *   *Training:* Requires a modified loss function, often incorporating a regularization term to penalize predictions made with low evidence, encouraging the model to learn high evidence only when confident.

    2.  **Conformal Prediction (CP):** A distribution-free approach providing prediction sets with guaranteed marginal coverage (Lit Review: 1, 10).
        *   *Procedure:* Requires a hold-out calibration set, $\{(X_i^{cal}, Y_i^{cal})\}_{i=1}^{n_{cal}}$. A non-conformity score $s(X, y)$ measures how 'unusual' observation $X$ is relative to class $y$ (e.g., $s(X, y) = 1 - \hat{p}_y$, where $\hat{p}_y$ is the model's predicted probability for class $y$). Calculate scores $s_i = s(X_i^{cal}, Y_i^{cal})$ for all calibration examples. Determine the $(1-\epsilon)$ quantile, $q_{1-\epsilon}$, of these scores (specifically, the $\lceil (n_{cal}+1)(1-\epsilon) \rceil / n_{cal}$ empirical quantile). For a new input $X_{new}$, the prediction set is $\mathcal{C}(X_{new}) = \{ y : s(X_{new}, y) \le q_{1-\epsilon} \}$.
        *   *Uncertainty:** The size of the prediction set $|\mathcal{C}(X_{new})|$ directly reflects uncertainty. Larger sets indicate higher uncertainty.
        *   *Adaptation for Graphs (CF-GNN):* We will adapt CP for GNNs, potentially using techniques like the topology-aware residual correction model proposed in CF-GNN (Lit Review: 1) to improve the efficiency (reduce set size) while maintaining coverage guarantees.

    The choice between EDL and CP (or potentially combining aspects) will depend on empirical performance regarding calibration, the ability to distinguish uncertainty types (EDL), and the strictness of coverage guarantees (CP).

*   **Training:** The KIGNET model will be trained end-to-end using standard gradient-based optimization (e.g., Adam). The loss function will primarily be cross-entropy for the diagnostic prediction task. If EDL is used, the loss will be modified accordingly (e.g., Type II Maximum Likelihood objective with KL divergence regularizer). Hyperparameters (learning rate, layer sizes, dropout rates, attention heads) will be tuned using a validation set.

**3.4. Experimental Design**
*   **Datasets:** MIMIC-III/IV or similar large EHR datasets. A held-out portion will be used for testing, and another portion for calibration (if using CP).
*   **Baselines:**
    *   *Standard ML:* Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Trees (using curated features).
    *   *Black-Box DL:* Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on curated features, standard GNN (e.g., GCN, GAT) without KG integration (operating on a generic patient similarity graph or simpler graph structure).
    *   *Post-hoc Interpretability:* Apply LIME or SHAP to the black-box DL models.
    *   *Simpler Interpretable Models:* Decision Trees, Rule-based systems.
    *   *Alternative UQ:* Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles applied to baseline GNNs.
    *   *Existing KG-based Models:* Compare against relevant published works if code/models are available (e.g., Lit Review: 4 adaptations if applicable).
*   **Evaluation Setup:**
    *   *Splitting:* Patient-level splits for training, validation, calibration (if needed), and testing to avoid data leakage. Standard k-fold cross-validation (e.g., k=5) on the training/validation data for robust performance estimation and hyperparameter tuning.
    *   *Implementation:* Python using libraries like PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, DGL, alongside libraries for UQ (e.g., Uncertainty Baselines) and interpretability (e.g., Captum).

**3.5. Evaluation Metrics**
*   **Predictive Performance:**
    *   Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score (macro- and micro-averaged), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR).
*   **Interpretability:**
    *   *Quantitative:*
        *   *Faithfulness:* Measure the impact on prediction when high-attention nodes/edges are removed or perturbed (e.g., Fidelity+ or Fidelity-). Higher impact suggests more faithful explanations.
        *   *Sparsity:* Measure the size or complexity of the explanation subgraph (e.g., number of nodes/edges with attention above a threshold). Smaller, focused explanations are often preferred.
    *   *Qualitative:*
        *   *Case Studies:* Generate explanations for selected patient cases (correctly/incorrectly classified, high/low uncertainty).
        *   *Clinician Evaluation:* Present case studies and explanations (visualized explanation subgraphs) to domain experts (physicians) for blinded evaluation. Assess: 1) Clinical relevance/correctness of highlighted concepts/relationships. 2) Understandability and clarity ('Does this explanation make sense?'). 3) Actionability ('Does insight help clinical judgment?'). Use Likert scales or structured feedback forms.
*   **Uncertainty Quantification:**
    *   *Calibration:* Reliability diagrams and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to assess if confidence scores match empirical accuracy. Brier score.
    *   *Coverage (for CP):* Verify if the empirical coverage on the test set matches the target coverage level ($1-\epsilon$).
    *   *Efficiency (for CP):* Average size of the prediction sets. Smaller sets (while maintaining coverage) are better.
    *   *Uncertainty Correlation:* Assess correlation between uncertainty scores (e.g., Vacuity from EDL, set size from CP) and prediction error. Evaluate if higher uncertainty correlates with out-of-distribution samples or rare disease prediction tasks. Visualization of uncertainty versus accuracy.
    *   *AUROC for OOD Detection:* Use uncertainty scores to distinguish in-distribution vs. out-of-distribution samples.
