**Title:** Harnessing Heavy Tails in Parameter Space for Improved Generalization

**Motivation:** While heavy-tailed distributions often arise naturally during neural network training, their direct impact on generalization remains poorly understood and often viewed negatively. This research seeks to re-evaluate this perception by investigating whether specific heavy-tailed characteristics in model parameters can be actively leveraged to enhance generalization performance and robustness.

**Main Idea:** We hypothesize that the degree and nature (e.g., tail index) of heavy-tailedness in weight distributions correlate with a model's ability to generalize. We propose systematically training various architectures on benchmark datasets, quantifying the heavy-tailed properties of their final parameter distributions using estimators robust to high dimensions. We will correlate these metrics with standard generalization measures (test accuracy, generalization gap) and robustness assays (e.g., performance under covariate shift). Crucially, we will explore novel regularization techniques or adaptive optimization strategies specifically designed to promote or control the emergence of heavy tails associated with better generalization, potentially leading to models that are inherently more robust and adaptable.
