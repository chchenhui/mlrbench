# SynDA: Synthetic Data Augmentation Meets Active Learning for Low-Resource ML in Developing Regions

## Introduction

The constant progress in machine learning (ML) has the potential to transform societies across the globe. However, the adoption of state-of-the-art (SOTA) ML methods in developing countries remains a significant challenge due to resource constraints. These constraints include limited labeled data, computational resources, and the cost of data annotation. Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and generative image models, while promising, often require large datasets and complex models that are infeasible to deploy in low-resource settings. Transfer learning, although a promising approach, often fails due to domain mismatch and biases in pre-training datasets. This gap between the requirements of SOTA methods and the capacities of developing countries hinders the democratization of ML.

The main goal of SynDA is to develop a framework that combines lightweight generative models with active learning to address the challenges of data scarcity and computational constraints in low-resource settings. By generating context-aware synthetic data and strategically selecting real samples for labeling, SynDA aims to reduce labeling costs, improve model adaptability, and enhance robustness to domain shifts. This approach has the potential to enable scalable ML solutions in sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, and education, thereby bridging the gap between SOTA methods and the realities of developing regions.

## Methodology

### Data Augmentation

The data augmentation component of SynDA leverages lightweight generative models to produce context-aware synthetic data. The key steps involved are:

1. **Generative Model Selection**: Choose a lightweight generative model such as distilled diffusion models or tiny Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that can be efficiently trained and deployed in resource-constrained environments.
2. **Minimal Local Data Seeds**: Use minimal local data seeds to initialize the generative model, ensuring that the synthetic data is relevant to the local context.
3. **Prompt-Guided Augmentation**: Employ prompt-guided augmentation techniques to mimic local agricultural landscapes, dialects, or other culturally significant features, ensuring that the synthetic data is contextually appropriate.
4. **Model Quantization**: Quantize the generative model to reduce its computational footprint, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

### Active Learning

The active learning component of SynDA involves iteratively generating synthetic data and selecting real samples for labeling based on model uncertainty and domain representativeness. The key steps are:

1. **Initial Model Training**: Train an initial model using the minimal local data seeds and the generated synthetic data.
2. **Model Uncertainty Estimation**: Estimate the uncertainty of the model's predictions for each sample in the dataset using techniques such as dropout or Monte Carlo dropout.
3. **Domain Representativeness**: Prioritize samples that are both uncertain and representative of the local domain, ensuring that the labeled data captures the diversity of real-world scenarios.
4. **Proxy Networks**: Use proxy networks to efficiently estimate the uncertainty of samples, reducing the computational cost of active sampling.
5. **Iterative Labeling**: Iteratively label the selected real samples and retrain the model, repeating the process until convergence or a predefined stopping criterion is met.

### Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness of SynDA, the following metrics will be used:

1. **Reduced Labeling Costs**: Measure the reduction in the number of real labels required to achieve a target performance level.
2. **Model Performance**: Evaluate the performance of the model on a held-out test set using standard metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
3. **Robustness to Domain Shifts**: Assess the model's ability to generalize to new domains by measuring its performance on domain-shifted datasets.
4. **Computational Efficiency**: Measure the computational resources required to train and deploy the model, including memory usage and inference time.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Reduced Labeling Costs

SynDA is expected to reduce the cost of data annotation by up to 50% compared to traditional approaches. This reduction is achieved by strategically selecting real samples for labeling based on model uncertainty and domain representativeness, thereby minimizing the amount of real data required.

The combination of synthetic data augmentation and active learning is expected to improve the adaptability of ML models to low-resource settings. By generating context-aware synthetic data and iteratively labeling real samples, SynDA ensures that the model captures the diversity of real-world scenarios, leading to improved performance and robustness.

### Robustness to Domain Shifts

SynDA is designed to enhance the robustness of ML models to domain shifts. By generating synthetic data that is relevant to the local context and iteratively labeling real samples, SynDA ensures that the model is adaptable to new domains, reducing the risk of performance degradation when deployed in different environments.

### Scalability and Computational Efficiency

SynDA is optimized for computational efficiency, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. By using lightweight generative models and quantizing the model, SynDA reduces the computational footprint, enabling efficient training and inference on resource-constrained devices.
