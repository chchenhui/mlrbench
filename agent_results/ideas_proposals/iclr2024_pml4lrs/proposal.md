# **Title**  
**SynDA: Synthetic Data Augmentation Meets Active Learning for Low-Resource ML in Developing Regions**  

---

# **1. Introduction**  

## **Background**  
Machine learning (ML) has achieved remarkable success in domains like healthcare, agriculture, and finance, but its deployment in developing regions remains limited. Resource constraints—such as scarce labeled data, computational bottlenecks, and domain mismatches—stall the adoption of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Transfer learning often fails due to biases in pre-trained models, while data annotation is prohibitively costly. For instance, in sub-Saharan Africa, only 5% of agricultural data is labeled, stifling AI-driven yield prediction tools. These challenges necessitate novel frameworks that balance data efficiency, computational practicality, and domain relevance.  

## **Research Objectives**  
This proposal aims to develop **SynDA**, a framework that synergizes *synthetic data generation* and *active learning* to address three key challenges in low-resource settings:  
1. **Data Scarcity**: Generate context-aware synthetic data using minimal local seed samples.  
2. **Cost-Efficient Labeling**: Prioritize labeling by quantifying uncertainty and domain representativeness.  
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Implement lightweight architectures via model compression for deployment on edge devices.  

## **Significance**  
SynDA bridges the gap between global SOTA methods and localized constraints by:  
- Enhancing fairness and cultural relevance via prompt-guided synthetic data.  
- Reducing labeling costs by 50% for equivalent or superior model performance.  
- Enabling real-time deployment through quantized models tailored for edge devices.  

This work directly aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2 (Zero Hunger) and 3 (Good Health), envisioning ML democratization in agriculture and healthcare in underserved regions.

# **2. Methodology**  

## **2.1 Lightweight Synthetic Data Generation**  
### **Architecture Design**  
We propose **TinySynth**, a family of generative models inspired by distilled diffusion models and compact GANs:  
- **Distilled Diffusion Models**: Simplify the noise prediction network (e.g., replacing ResNet blocks with MobileNet-style depthwise convolutions) while retaining multimodal capabilities for text- or domain-guided generation.  
- **TinyGANs**: Implement lightweight discriminators and generators using neural architecture search (NAS) for parameter-efficient design.  

### **Prompt-Guided Contextual Augmentation**  
To address domain mismatches (e.g., agricultural landscapes in rural India vs. datasets dominated by U.S. farms), SynDA employs:  
1. **Prompt Engineering**: Local experts define contextual cues (e.g., "rice paddies in monsoon season" for agriculture or dialectal phonetic markers for speech).  
2. **Conditional Generation**: Synthetic data is conditioned on these prompts using a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder for images or BPE tokenizers for text. For diffusion models, the noise prediction network incorporates prompt embeddings via cross-attention.  

**Example Mathematical Workflow**:  
For an image generation task:  
$$
x_{t} = \sqrt{\alpha_t} x_{t-1} + \sqrt{1-\alpha_t} \epsilon_{\theta}(x_{t-1}, c),
$$  
where $x_{t}$ represents the noised image at step $t$, $\epsilon_{\theta}$ predicts noise conditioned on $c$ (prompt embeddings), and $\alpha_t$ controls the noise schedule.  

### **Quantization and Computation Optimization**  
To meet constrained computational budgets:  
- **8-bit Quantization**: Reduce generator model size by 4× using Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) in TensorFlow Lite.  
- **Pruning**: Remove redundant filters in CNNs using magnitude-based pruning (∼30% sparsity).  
- **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**: Simulate low-precision inference during training for robustness.  

**Validation**: Compare FLOPs (Floating-Point Operations per Second) and latency (in milliseconds per image) against full-precision baselines using ONNX benchmarking.

## **2.2 Active Learning with Uncertainty and Domain Representativeness**  
### **Proxy-Based Active Sampling**  
We deploy a **low-capacity proxy network** (e.g., a shallow CNN) to emulate the full learner’s uncertainty, reducing compute costs. Let $f_{\theta} : \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ denote the classifier. For unlabeled samples $x \in \mathcal{U}$, SynDA computes two scores:  
1. **Uncertainty Score**:  
   $$
   U(x) = 1 - \max_{y} f_{\theta}(y|x),
   $$  
   quantifying confidence in top predictions.  
2. **Domain Representativeness Score**:  
   $$
   D(x) = \text{Cosine Similarity}(\phi(x), \mu_{\text{target}}),
   $$  
   where $\phi(x)$ are feature embeddings from the proxy model, and $\mu_{\text{target}}$ is the mean embedding of target domain samples.  

### **Composite Sampling Strategy**  
Candidates are selected via:  
$$
\text{Score}(x) = \alpha \cdot U(x) + (1 - \alpha) \cdot D(x),
$$  
where $\alpha \in [0,1]$ balances uncertainty and domain alignment. We iteratively query human annotators (local experts) for labels of top-$k$ samples.  

**Algorithm Outline**:  
1. Initialize generator $G$ with local seed data.  
2. Train classifier $f_{\theta}$ on synthetic data.  
3. Compute $U(x)$ and $D(x)$ for all unlabeled samples $\mathcal{U}$.  
4. Select $k$ samples with highest $\text{Score}(x)$ for labeling.  
5. Retrain $f_{\theta}$ and fine-tune $G$ using newly labeled data.

## **2.3 Experimental Design**  
### **Datasets**  
- **Agriculture**: Maize disease images from Kenya (200 images) and synthetic counterparts.  
- **Text**: Swahili news classification (1,000 labeled sentences).  
- **Speech**: Dialectal speech recognition in Nigeria (50 hours of audio).  

### **Baselines**  
1. **Synth-Only**: Full resource generation without active learning (e.g., AugGen (2025)).  
2. **AL-Only**: Active learning with SMOTE-based augmentation (Chen et al. 2024).  
3. **Hybrid**: State-of-the-art combining synthesis and AL (Kimmich et al. 2022).  

### **Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Primary**: Label efficiency (labels to reach 90% baseline accuracy) and domain adaptation error.  
- **Secondary**: Uncertainty calibration (Brier score), generation quality (FID for images), computational latency (ms/frame).  
- **Fairness**: Disparate impact in synthetic data (e.g., $\Delta \text{Accuracy} \leq 5\%$ between skin tones in healthcare datasets).  

### **Ablation Studies**  
- Impact of $\alpha$ imbalance on labeling cost.  
- Trade-offs between generation quality (FID) and quantizer bitwidth (e.g., 4-bit vs. 8-bit).  

### **Metrics**  
- **Label Cost**: \% reduction vs. baselines.  
- **Model Adaptability**: Accuracy on domain-shifted test data (e.g., cropping patterns from Tanzania after training on Kenya).  
- **Computational Efficiency**: FPS on a Jetson Nano GPU.
