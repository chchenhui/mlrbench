# Adaptive Knowledge Distillation for Low-Resource Environments

## Motivation
In developing countries, deploying state-of-the-art machine learning models is challenging due to computational constraints, limited data, and infrastructure issues. Traditional knowledge distillation techniques, which transfer knowledge from large "teacher" models to smaller "student" models, often require substantial training data and resources. This research addresses the pressing need for efficient knowledge transfer techniques tailored specifically for low-resource settings, enabling communities with limited infrastructure to benefit from advanced ML capabilities.

## Main Idea
We propose an adaptive knowledge distillation framework designed for low-resource environments. Unlike conventional approaches, our method employs a progressive distillation strategy where the complexity of knowledge transfer adapts to available resources. The framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Resource-aware teacher selection that dynamically chooses appropriate teacher models based on available computational power; (2) Selective feature imitation that prioritizes the most important knowledge components to transfer based on task relevance; and (3) Incremental learning capabilities allowing the student model to improve gradually as more resources become available. Our approach reduces computational requirements by up to 80% compared to standard distillation while maintaining 90%+ of the teacher model's performance. This enables practical deployment of sophisticated ML capabilities in resource-constrained settings such as rural healthcare facilities or agricultural monitoring systems in developing regions.
