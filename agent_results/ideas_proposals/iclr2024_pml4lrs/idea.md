**Title:** SynDA: Synthetic Data Augmentation Meets Active Learning for Low-Resource ML in Developing Regions  

**Motivation:** In developing regions, data scarcity and biased pre-trained models hinder the deployment of ML solutions. Transfer learning often fails due to domain mismatch, while labeling real data is costly. A method to generate context-aware synthetic data and strategically collect labels is critical to bridge this gap.  

**Main Idea:** Develop *SynDA*, a framework combining lightweight generative models (e.g., distilled diffusion models or tiny GANs) with active learning. First, minimal local data seeds synthetic data generation, ensuring cultural/environmental relevance via prompt-guided augmentation (e.g., mimicking local agricultural landscapes or dialects). Next, an active learning loop prioritizes labeling real samples that maximize model uncertainty *and* domain representativeness, avoiding biases in synthetic data. The pipeline optimizes for compute efficiency: generators use quantization, and active sampling employs proxy networks. Outcomes include reduced labeling costs (50% fewer labels), improved model adaptability, and robustness to domain shifts. Impact: Enables scalable ML solutions in healthcare, agriculture, etc., by addressing both data scarcity and computational constraints.
