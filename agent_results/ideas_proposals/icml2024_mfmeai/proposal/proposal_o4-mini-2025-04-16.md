Title  
Semantic-Hierarchical Control: A Multi‐Modal Foundation Model–Powered Embodied AI Controller

1. Introduction  
Background  
Recent advances in Multi‐Modal Foundation Models (MFMs) such as CLIP, GPT-4V, ImageBind and DALL·E 3 have delivered rich, high‐level semantic representations of visual, depth and audio streams. Meanwhile, Embodied AI has made strides in photorealistic simulators (Habitat, AI2-THOR, RoboTHOR) and hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) for navigation and manipulation. Yet a fundamental gap persists: How can we transform the broad‐scope semantic insights of MFMs into precise, low‐level controls for real‐world robots?  

Research Objectives  
1. Design a two‐tiered, modular architecture that unites a frozen MFM (upper tier) with a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) controller (lower tier).  
2. Develop algorithms for self‐supervised pseudo‐instruction generation by the MFM to bootstrap HRL subgoal discovery.  
3. Demonstrate significant gains in sample efficiency, task generalization and sim‐to‐real transfer for embodied tasks such as object fetching, navigation and pick-and-place.  

Significance  
Bridging semantic reasoning and motor control is vital for generalist robots—home assistants, warehouse manipulators or search‐and‐rescue drones. Our framework unifies:  
• High‐level goal reasoning (e.g., “bring me the red mug”) powered by MFMs.  
• Low‐level, skill‐based controllers (e.g., grasp, navigate) optimized via HRL.  
Such an approach promises to reduce expensive data collection, improve adaptability to novel scenarios, and accelerate real‐world deployment of embodied agents.

2. Literature Review  
1. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning in Complex 3D Environments (Pires et al., 2023)  
   • Introduces H2O2, an HRL agent that discovers options autonomously in 3D tasks.  
   • Demonstrates competitive performance in DeepMind Hard Eight, highlighting the power of hierarchy in partial observability.  

2. PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model (Driess et al., 2023)  
   • Integrates continuous real‐world sensor inputs into a language model for planning and VQA.  
   • Shows positive transfer across manipulation, navigation and captioning tasks.  

3. Hierarchical Skills for Efficient Exploration (Gehring et al., 2021)  
   • Presents unsupervised skill acquisition of varying complexity to accelerate exploration.  
   • Balances generality and specificity for sparse‐reward robotic tasks.  

4. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning By Discovering Intrinsic Options (Zhang et al., 2021)  
   • Proposes HIDIO, which learns task‐agnostic options via intrinsic entropy minimization.  
   • Achieves high sample efficiency in sparse‐reward navigation and manipulation.  

Key Challenges  
• Semantic‐to‐motor gap: Translating MFM outputs into precise actions.  
• Sample efficiency: Learning in complex, partially observed 3D environments with minimal data.  
• Generalization: Adapting to novel tasks and objects without retraining.  
• Multimodal fusion: Unifying RGB, depth and audio signals.  
• Sim-to-real transfer: Overcoming reality gaps in sensor noise and dynamics.

3. Methodology  
3.1 System Architecture  
Our framework comprises two tiers (Figure 1):  
• Tier I: Frozen Multi‐Modal Foundation Model (MFM)  
  – Input: Raw streams $\mathbf{x}_t = \{\text{RGB}_t, \text{Depth}_t, \text{Audio}_t\}$.  
  – Output: Semantic affordance map $A_t$ and goal embedding $g_t$.  
• Tier II: Hierarchical Controller  
  – High‐Level Policy $\pi_H$: maps $(A_t, g_t)\to$ discrete subgoals $o_t$ (e.g., “navigate to red mug”).  
  – Low‐Level Controllers $\{\pi_L^i\}$: each specialized motion skill (navigation, grasp, place) that executes actions $a_t$ conditioned on subgoal $o_t$.  

3.2 Problem Formulation  
We model an embodied task as a Partially‐Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)  
$$\mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{O}, T, R, \gamma),$$  
where $\mathcal{S}$ is the state space, $\mathcal{A}$ the action space, $\mathcal{O}$ the observation space, $T$ the transition model, $R$ the reward, and $\gamma$ the discount factor.  

Hierarchical decomposition:  
• High‐level MDP: states $s^H_t = (A_t, g_t)$, actions $o_t\in \mathcal{O}$, reward $r^H_t$, transition $T^H$.  
• Low‐level MDP for each skill $i$: states $s^L_t$, actions $a_t$, reward $r^L_t$, transition $T^L$.  

The overall objective is to maximize  
$$J(\theta_H,\theta_L) = \mathbb{E}\bigg[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t\bigg],$$  
where $r_t = r^H_t + r^L_t$ and policies are parameterized by $\theta_H,\theta_L$.

3.3 Data Collection & Self‐Supervision  
• Simulator: Habitat-SIM with photorealistic scans.  
• Exploration: Randomized episodes where MFM generates pseudo‐instructions.  
• Pseudo‐Instruction Generation: Given scene $\mathbf{x}_t$, MFM outputs language prompt $\ell_t$ (e.g., “Pick up the blue book”).  
• Affordance Labeling: MFM produces soft masks $A_t^c$ per object class $c$.  
• Dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(\mathbf{x}_t, A_t, \ell_t)\}_{t=1}^N$ for bootstrapping high‐level policy.  

3.4 Algorithmic Details  
Step 1: High‐Level Policy Pretraining  
  • Use imitation learning on $\mathcal{D}$.  
  • Behavioral cloning loss:  
    $$\mathcal{L}_{BC}(\theta_H) = -\mathbb{E}_{(A,\ell,o^\ast)\sim\mathcal{D}}\big[\log \pi_H(o^\ast\,|\,A,\ell;\theta_H)\big].$$  

Step 2: Low‐Level Controller Pretraining  
  • Train each skill $\pi_L^i$ via on-policy RL in skill‐specific environments (e.g., navigation in empty room, grasping in clutter).  
  • Use PPO or SAC to optimize  
    $$\mathcal{L}_{RL}(\theta_L^i) = -\mathbb{E}[\sum_t \gamma^t r^L_t].$$  

Step 3: Hierarchical Fine‐Tuning  
  • End‐to‐end HRL: interleaved updates of $\theta_H,\theta_L$ using hierarchical PPO:  
    – Collect rollouts where $\pi_H$ selects subgoals and $\pi_L$ executes.  
    – Compute hierarchical advantage estimators $A^H_t,A^L_t$.  
    – Update  
      $$\theta_H \leftarrow \theta_H + \alpha_H \nabla_{\theta_H} \mathcal{L}_{PPO}^H,\quad  
        \theta_L \leftarrow \theta_L + \alpha_L \nabla_{\theta_L} \mathcal{L}_{PPO}^L.$$  

3.5 Fusion of Multimodal Inputs  
• Affordance Map $A_t$ is a concatenation of per‐pixel class scores from MFM.  
• Goal Embedding $g_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a sentence embedding from MFM.  
• High‐level policy uses a Transformer encoder to fuse $(A_t,g_t)$ into a joint latent  
  $$h_t = \mathrm{Transformer}(\mathrm{Flatten}(A_t)\oplus g_t).$$  

3.6 Experimental Design  
Benchmarks:  
• ObjectNav ($\text{SPL}$, Success Rate),  
• Pick‐and‐Place (task success, average reward),  
• Multi‐Object Fetch (new in this work).  

Baselines:  
• Non‐hierarchical RL (PPO‐vision),  
• Hierarchical RL without MFM (H2O2),  
• PaLM-E stylized agent.  

Metrics:  
• Sample Efficiency: episodes to 80% success,  
• Generalization: zero‐shot to unseen objects/environments,  
• Sim‐to‐Real Transfer Gap: performance drop when deploying on a physical robot.  

Ablations:  
• No pseudo‐instructions,  
• Frozen vs. fine‐tuned MFM,  
• Single‐ vs. multi‐skill low‐level controllers.

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
4.1 Expected Outcomes  
• Sample Efficiency Gain: We expect a 3× reduction in required episodes vs. non‐hierarchical RL.  
• Enhanced Generalization: Zero‐shot success on 70% of novel object–environment pairs (vs. <40% for baselines).  
• Seamless Modularity: Demonstrated plug‐and‐play of new motion primitives without retraining high level.  
• Real‐World Viability: ≤15% performance degradation when transferring policies from sim to a WidowX 250 robot arm with onboard RGB-D.

4.2 Impact  
Bridging semantics and control at scale will:  
• Accelerate deployment of home assistant robots capable of understanding spoken instructions (“Bring me the red mug in the kitchen.”) and executing delicate manipulations.  
• Provide a blueprint for future embodied agents that leverage open‐source MFMs for high‐level reasoning, reducing the need for bespoke perception modules.  
• Enable research in interactive, lifelong‐learning robots by decoupling semantic understanding (frozen MFM) from policy learning (HRL), facilitating continual skill acquisition.  

In sum, this proposal charts a path toward truly generalist embodied AI by unifying the strengths of large‐scale, pre‐trained multimodal models with principled hierarchical control methods.
