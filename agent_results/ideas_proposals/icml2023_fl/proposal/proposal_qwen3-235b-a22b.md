# FedPEFT: Parameter-Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning for Foundation Models on Heterogeneous Devices  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
The rapid advancement of foundation models (FMs)—large-scale pre-trained models capable of adapting to diverse tasks—has transformed machine learning. Technologies like transformers have enabled breakthroughs in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal tasks. However, deploying FMs in federated learning (FL) settings poses unique challenges. FL’s emphasis on privacy preservation through decentralized training conflicts with the computational and communication demands of large models. Traditional full-model fine-tuning in FL requires transmitting high-dimensional gradients, leading to unacceptable communication overhead and resource constraints on edge devices.  

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and adapters, offer a solution. These methods introduce small, task-specific parameters (e.g., low-rank matrices) while freezing the majority of pre-trained weights, reducing both computation and communication costs. Existing works like SLoRA (Babakniya et al., 2023) and FeDeRA (Yan et al., 2024) have explored PEFT in FL but face limitations in handling device heterogeneity and fully leveraging adaptive resource allocation.  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop **FedPEFT**, a novel framework that enhances PEFT techniques for federated settings by addressing the following challenges:  
1. **Device Heterogeneity:** Design a dynamic allocation mechanism for PEFT modules based on client-specific computational, memory, and communication constraints.  
2. **Adaptive Aggregation:** Develop novel strategies to aggregate sparse, low-rank matrices while preserving global and task-specific knowledge.  
3. **Utility-Privacy Trade-off:** Maintain accuracy while minimizing the leakage of sensitive information from sparse updates.  

### Significance  
FedPEFT directly addresses FL’s core challenges:  
- **Scalability:** Reducing communication costs by transmitting only PEFT modules (≤1% of total parameters) instead of full models.  
- **Personalization:** Enabling device-specific adaptations without compromising global model performance.  
- **Privacy Preservation:** Limiting exposure of private data through task-agnostic parameter freezing.  

This work bridges the gap between theoretical PEFT advancements and practical deployment demands, paving the way for FL to leverage FMs in real-world applications like mobile healthcare, edge computing, and multilingual systems.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Overview  
FedPEFT integrates three core components:  
1. **PEFT-Aware Global Model Architecture:** Embedding configurable PEFT modules (e.g., LoRA, adapters) into each layer of the FM.  
2. **Resource-Aware Client Selection and Adaptation:** Dynamically allocating PEFT module types (rank, sparsity) based on client capabilities.  
3. **Aggregation of Low-Rank Updates:** Designing server-side aggregation protocols for sparse parameter matrices.  

### 2.2 PEFT Techniques for Foundation Models  

#### Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)  
LoRA introduces low-rank matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d}$ into a layer’s weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, replacing updates with $W = W_0 + AB^\top$, where $W_0$ is fixed. The rank $r \ll d$ reduces trainable parameters from $O(d^2)$ to $O(rd)$.  

#### Adapters  
Small bottleneck layers are inserted between existing modules, such as:  
$$
z = \sigma\left(\frac{W_{\text{down}}x}{\sqrt{r}}\right)W_{\text{up}} \quad \text{for } x \in \mathbb{R}^d,
$$  
with $W_{\text{down}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$, $W_{\text{up}} \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d}$.  

### 2.3 Dynamic PEFT Module Allocation  

Clients submit a **device profile** $\mathcal{D}_i = \{C_i, M_i, B_i\}$ specifying:  
- **Computation (C):** FLOPS capacity (e.g., mobile GPUs).  
- **Memory (M):** Available RAM for model caching and training.  
- **Bandwidth (B):** Effective upload speed.  

The server calculates a **budget score** $S_i = w_C C_i + w_M M_i + w_B B_i$, where $w_* \in [0,1]$ are weights determined by the task. Clients are grouped into clusters (e.g., using k-means), and each cluster is assigned tailored PEFT parameters:  
- **Mobile-tier clients (low S_i):** LoRA with $r=8$, sparsity $s=50\%$.  
- **Edge-tier clients (medium S_i):** LoRA with $r=16$, adapters in attention layers.  
- **Infrastructure-tier clients (high S_i):** Full PEFT fine-tuning.  

This allocation balances performance and efficiency (Figure 1).  

### 2.4 Training and Aggregation Protocol  

#### FedPEFT Algorithm  
1. **Initialization:**  
   - Preload $W_0$ into all clients.  
   - Allocate PEFT modules based on device profiles.  
2. **For each round $t = 1, ..., T$:**  
   a. **Client Update:**  
      i. Sample a batch $\{(x_j, y_j)\}$ at client $i$ using its local data.  
      ii. Compute gradients $\nabla \mathcal{L}(W_i^t, \{(x_j, y_j)\})$ only on PEFT parameters $P_i^t$.  
      iii. Transmit $P_i^t$ to the server.  
   b. **Global Aggregation:**  
      i. Aggregate modules using **Weighted Low-Rank Averaging (WLRA):**  
      $$
      P_{\text{global}}^{t+1} = \frac{1}{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} n_i} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} n_i \cdot P_i^t,
      $$  
      where $n_i$ is the client’s data size and $\mathcal{S}$ is the selected subset.  
      ii. Update the global $W_0$ using compressed PEFT layers.  

#### Mitigating Heterogeneity  
To address non-i.i.d. data, FedPEFT employs:  
1. **Personalized Regularization:** Add $ \lambda \cdot \|P_i - P_{\text{global}}\|$ to the loss to prevent overfitting.  
2. **Progressive Unfreezing:** Gradually unfreeze layers (from head to body) for clients with high data heterogeneity.  

### 2.5 Experimental Design  

#### **Datasets**  
1. **Text:** Federated version of GLUE benchmarks (with synthetic non-IID splits).  
2. **Speech:** Google Speech Commands (cross-device FL).  
3. **Vision:** Fed-NTU Dataset (cross-silo FL for human action recognition).  

#### **Baselines**  
- FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017), FedProx (Li et al., 2020), and FedOpt (Reddi et al., 2021).  
- PEFT-based: SLoRA (Babakniya et al., 2023), FedPEAT (Chua et al., 2023), FeDeRA (Yan et al., 2024).  

#### **Metrics**  
1. **Model Utility:** Macro F1-score, accuracy.  
2. **Efficiency:** Communication cost (bytes), training time.  
3. **Privacy:** Membership inference attack (MIA) risk (Yeom et al., 2018).  
4. **Fairness:** Disparate impact ratio across client clusters.  

#### **Implementation Details**  
All experiments use PySyft and Flower. For reproducibility, hyperparameters are as follows:  
- **Global Rounds:** 100  
- **Client Sample Rate:** 10% per round  
- **PEFT Ranks:** $r \in \{4, 8, 16\}$  
- **Learning Rate:** 3e-4 (clients), 1e-2 (AdamW optimizer).  

### 2.6 Theoretical Analysis  

#### Convergence Bound  
Under partial client participation and non-convex objectives, the convergence rate is bounded by:  
$$
\mathbb{E}\left[\|\nabla \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{w})\|^2\right] \leq \mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{n_{\min}}}\right),
$$  
where $R$ is the number of global rounds and $n_{\min}$ is the smallest client dataset size. This bound incorporates the heterogeneity-aware regularization term.  

#### Communication Cost Analysis  
For a model with $d$ total parameters, transmitting full gradients requires $O(d)$ bits. With FedPEFT, the cost reduces to $O(r \cdot d)$ per layer, achieving a compression ratio of $\frac{r}{d}$. For example, $r=8$ and $d=10^4$ yields a 1,250× reduction.

   - Reduce communication overhead by ≥1,000× compared to FedAvg on models like BERT$_\text{large}$ (335M parameters).  
   - Achieve ≥90% accuracy on GLUE tasks within 30% fewer training rounds versus SLoRA.  

2. **Adaptability:**  
   - Demonstrate robustness to device skew by outperforming FedProx by 15–20% in test accuracy under extreme non-IID splits (α < 0.1 in Dirichlet distribution).  

3. **Privacy Enhancements:**  
   - Reduce MIA success rates by 30% over full-model fine-tuning via parameter freezing and gradient sparsity.  

### 3.2 Anticipated Scientific Impact  
1. **Framework Generalization:** Enable FL deployment for FMs across domains (e.g., LLMs, vision models).  
2. **Industry Adoption:** Facilitate privacy-preserving updates in healthcare (HIPAA-compliant models) and personalized recommendation systems.  
3. **Open-Source Contribution:** Release FedPEFT with PySyft/FedML integration to accelerate FL-PEFT research.  

By unifying resource-aware PEFT modules with novel federation techniques, FedPEFT directly addresses FL’s scalability bottlenecks while maintaining accuracy and personalization. This work will catalyze future research in decentralized learning for billion-parameter models under real-world edge constraints.
