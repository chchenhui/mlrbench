**Title:** **Cognitive Architecture Infusion: Enhancing LLMs with Human Memory Systems for AGI Advancement**  

**Motivation:** Current LLMs excel at pattern recognition but struggle with dynamic reasoning, contextual planning, and long-term knowledge integration—hallmarks of human intelligence. Bridging this gap requires moving beyond data-driven models to architectures inspired by the brain’s memory systems, which enable humans to efficiently reason, learn, and adapt.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes integrating human-like memory hierarchies (working, episodic, semantic) into LLMs to mimic cognitive processes. A hybrid neuro-symbolic framework would map:  
- **Working Memory**: Short-term attention mechanisms for active problem-solving.  
- **Episodic Memory**: Retrieval-augmented modules to contextualize tasks using past experiences.  
- **Semantic Memory**: Structured knowledge graphs for persistent, abstract reasoning.  

The architecture would be tested on dynamic planning tasks (e.g., interactive simulations, iterative puzzles) requiring multi-step reasoning and adaptive learning. Performance would be benchmarked against traditional LLMs using metrics like task accuracy, reasoning depth, and temporal coherence. Expected outcomes include improved contextual awareness, reduced hallucination, and better transfer learning. By grounding LLMs in biologically inspired systems, this work could unlock more robust, generalizable intelligence—narrowing critical gaps toward AGI.
