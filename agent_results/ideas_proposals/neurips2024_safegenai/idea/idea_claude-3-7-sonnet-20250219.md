# Detection and Mitigation of Hallucinatory Confidence in Generative Models

## Motivation
Generative AI models, particularly large language models, often produce content with a false sense of certainty even when the information is incorrect or fabricated. This "hallucinatory confidence" can lead users to trust unreliable outputs, potentially causing harmful decision-making in critical domains like healthcare, legal contexts, or scientific research. Current approaches focus primarily on detecting factual inaccuracies but fail to address the problem of models expressing high confidence in incorrect outputs, which amplifies the risks of misinformation and erodes trust in AI systems.

## Main Idea
This research proposes a dual-phase approach to tackle hallucinatory confidence in generative models. First, we'll develop a novel confidence calibration framework that trains models to express appropriate uncertainty levels correlated with their actual knowledge boundaries. This involves creating specialized datasets of "known unknowns" and implementing uncertainty-aware training objectives. Second, we'll design an integrated confidence verification system that automatically flags potentially overconfident outputs by triangulating information across multiple knowledge sources and reasoning paths. The system will include human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms to continuously improve calibration. We expect this approach to significantly reduce instances of overconfidence while preserving model utility, ultimately creating safer generative AI systems that communicate their limitations transparently to users.
