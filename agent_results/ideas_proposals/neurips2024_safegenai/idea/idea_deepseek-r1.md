**Title:** Calibrating Confidence in Generative AI through Uncertainty-Aware Reinforcement Learning  

**Motivation:** Generative AI systems often produce overconfident outputs, leading users to overtrust incorrect or harmful content. This poses risks in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and scientific research, where uncalibrated confidence can propagate errors or unsafe decisions. Addressing this overconfidence is critical to ensuring reliable and trustworthy deployment of generative models.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes training generative models with **uncertainty-aware reinforcement learning (RL)** to align confidence scores with the true likelihood of correctness. The method integrates uncertainty quantification (e.g., Bayesian dropout or ensemble variance) into the RL reward function, penalizing both incorrect outputs and improperly calibrated confidence. For example, a language model generating medical advice would receive higher rewards for answers that are both accurate and accompanied by low confidence when uncertain. The framework will be tested on benchmarks spanning text, image, and multimodal generation tasks, evaluating both output quality and calibration metrics (e.g., expected calibration error). Expected outcomes include models that explicitly signal uncertainty, enabling safer human-AI collaboration. Potential impacts include reduced overtrust in generative AI and improved safety guardrails for critical applications.
