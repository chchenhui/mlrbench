**SmoothGen: Certified Robustness for Conditional Generative Models via Randomized Smoothing**  

---

### 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Generative models, including text-to-image diffusion models and large language models (LLMs), have revolutionized scientific discovery and industrial applications. They enable automated experimental design, hypothesis generation, and content creation at scale. However, their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations in conditioning inputs (e.g., text prompts or image seeds) poses significant safety risks. For instance, minor input alterations can lead to harmful outputs, such as biased medical diagnoses or misleading legal documents. Existing defenses, like adversarial training, often lack *provable* robustness guarantees, leaving systems vulnerable to novel attack vectors.  

**Research Objectives**  
This work aims to develop **SmoothGen**, a framework for certifying the robustness of conditional generative models against adversarial perturbations. Key objectives include:  
1. **Extend randomized smoothing** to high-dimensional generative tasks by deriving theoretical guarantees on output distribution stability under input perturbations.  
2. **Preserve generation quality** via adaptive noise calibration in latent space, balancing robustness and fidelity.  
3. **Empirically validate** the approach on diffusion models and LLMs, measuring certified robustness radii and perceptual quality.  

**Significance**  
SmoothGen addresses critical safety challenges in deploying generative AI for sensitive domains (e.g., healthcare, legal). By providing the first framework for *certified robustness* in conditional generation, it mitigates risks of adversarial misuse while maintaining practical utility.

### 2. Methodology  

#### 2.1 Algorithmic Framework  
SmoothGen integrates randomized smoothing with conditional generative models through three stages:  

**1. Input Perturbation**  
For a conditioning input $x$ (e.g., text embedding or image seed), sample $n$ noisy variants $\{\tilde{x}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ from a smoothing distribution $\mathcal{D}_x$. For text prompts, noise is added in the embedding space; for images, in pixel or latent space. The distribution $\mathcal{D}_x$ is designed to enable tractable certification—e.g., isotropic Gaussian noise $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$.  

**2. Noisy Generation**  
Pass each $\tilde{x}_i$ through the base generative model $G$ to produce outputs $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^n$. For diffusion models, this involves perturbing the initial noise or conditioning vectors; for LLMs, perturbing token embeddings.  

**3. Aggregation**  
Compute the smoothed output distribution $P_{\text{smooth}}(y | x)$ by averaging over the $n$ samples. For discrete outputs (e.g., text), use majority voting; for continuous outputs (e.g., images), employ Wasserstein barycenters:  
$$
\bar{y} = \arg \min_{y} \sum_{i=1}^n W_2^2(y, y_i),
$$  
where $W_2$ is the 2-Wasserstein distance.  

#### 2.2 Certified Robustness Analysis  
Let $\delta$ be an adversarial perturbation bounded by $\|\delta\|_2 \leq R$. SmoothGen certifies that the Wasserstein distance between the original and perturbed output distributions is bounded:  
$$
W_2\left(P_{\text{smooth}}(y | x), P_{\text{smooth}}(y | x + \delta)\right) \leq C \cdot R,
$$  
where $C$ depends on the noise magnitude $\sigma$ and the Lipschitz constant of $G$. Using the Neyman-Pearson lemma, we derive the maximum $R$ (certified radius) for which this bound holds with probability $1 - \alpha$.  

**Theorem 1 (Certified Robustness):**  
For a base generator $G$ with $L$-Lipschitz continuity in its conditioning input, and smoothing noise $\sigma$, the certified radius $R$ satisfies:  
$$
R \geq \frac{\sigma}{L} \left( \Phi^{-1}(p_A) - \Phi^{-1}(p_B) \right),
$$  
where $p_A$ and $p_B$ are the probabilities of the most probable and runner-up output classes (for discrete outputs) or modes (for continuous outputs), and $\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse Gaussian CDF.  

#### 2.3 Adaptive Noise Calibration  
To mitigate quality degradation from excessive noise, SmoothGen employs:  
- **Gradient-Based Noise Scaling**: Adjust $\sigma$ per input using the gradient of the generator’s loss:  
  $$
  \sigma(x) = \sigma_0 \cdot \left(1 + \lambda \|\nabla_x \mathcal{L}(G(x))\|_2\right),
  $$  
  where $\sigma_0$ is a baseline noise level and $\lambda$ controls sensitivity.  
- **Dynamic Sampling**: Allocate more samples $n$ to inputs with higher gradient magnitudes, reducing computational overhead.  

#### 2.4 Experimental Design  

**Datasets & Models**  
- **Text-to-Image**: Evaluate on Stable Diffusion (v2.1) with COCO and medical imaging datasets (e.g., CheXpert).  
- **Text Generation**: Test GPT-3 and Llama-2 on legal document drafting (e.g., CUAD dataset) and biomedical QA (PubMedQA).  

**Baselines**  
Compare against:  
1. Standard randomized smoothing for GANs [7].  
2. Adversarially trained generators [4].  
3. Non-smoothed generative models.  

**Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Certified Robustness Radius**: Maximum $R$ (in ℓ₂ norm) for which outputs remain stable.  
- **Generation Quality**: Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), BLEU score (for text).  
- **Human Evaluation**: Crowdsourced ratings of output relevance and coherence.  

**Attack Scenarios**  
- **White-Box Attacks**: Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) on text embeddings or image latents.  
- **Black-Box Attacks**: Transfer attacks from surrogate models.

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Theoretical Guarantees**: A robustness certificate bounding the Wasserstein shift in outputs under adversarial perturbations.  
2. **Empirical Validation**: SmoothGen will achieve:  
   - Certified radii 2–3× larger than baseline methods on text-to-image and text generation tasks.  
   - FID scores within 5% of non-smoothed models, demonstrating minimal quality loss.  
3. **Adaptive Noise Benefits**: Gradient-based calibration will reduce quality degradation by 30% compared to fixed-noise smoothing.  

**Impact**  
- **Safety-Critical Applications**: Enable reliable deployment of generative models in healthcare (e.g., synthetic MRI generation), legal tech, and autonomous systems.  
- **Research Community**: Establish a foundation for certifying robustness in high-dimensional generative tasks, influencing standards for AI safety evaluation.  
- **Societal Trust**: Mitigate risks of harmful content generation, fostering public confidence in generative AI technologies.
