# Interleaved Reasoning and Decision-Making Networks for Open-World Agents

## Motivation
Current AI systems excel at either reasoning (like LLMs in question-answering) or decision-making (like RL agents in control tasks), but rarely both simultaneously. This separation creates a critical gap in developing truly adaptive open-world agents. Human cognition seamlessly interleaves these processes - we reason about our environment while making decisions, and our decisions inform future reasoning paths. Bridging this divide is essential for creating agents that can navigate novel, dynamic environments with minimal supervision.

## Main Idea
I propose Interleaved Reasoning and Decision-Making Networks (IRDNs), an architecture that explicitly connects reasoning and action selection through a shared knowledge representation system. The IRDN consists of three components: (1) a reasoning module that generates explanations and predictions, (2) a decision module that selects actions, and (3) a mediating knowledge bank that facilitates bidirectional information flow between these systems. The key innovation is a "cognitive cycle" mechanism where reasoning outputs directly influence the action space, and action outcomes update the knowledge representations used for reasoning. Through continual learning, the system progressively builds abstracted reasoning patterns that facilitate generalization to novel scenarios. Success would be measured by the agent's ability to solve previously unseen tasks by drawing appropriate analogies from its knowledge bank without task-specific supervision.
