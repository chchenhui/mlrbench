**Title:** Dynamic Knowledge-Integrated Reinforcement Learning for Open-World Reasoning and Decision-Making  

**Motivation:** Current AI systems often compartmentalize reasoning (e.g., language models) and decision-making (e.g., reinforcement learning), limiting adaptability in open-world scenarios where novel tasks, dynamic environments, and continuous knowledge acquisition are critical. Bridging this gap is essential for creating agents that generalize across unseen challenges while leveraging prior and newly acquired knowledge.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a framework integrating large language models (LLMs) for contextual reasoning with model-based reinforcement learning (RL) for decision-making, mediated by a dynamic knowledge graph. The LLM generates hypotheses and plans based on the current state and knowledge graph, while the RL agent refines and executes actions, updating the knowledge graph with environmental feedback. Key innovations include: (1) a bidirectional interface where reasoning informs action exploration and outcomes refine reasoning priors, and (2) open-vocabulary knowledge acquisition via LLM-driven graph expansion. Benchmarks would test generalization in procedurally generated environments requiring multi-step planning and adaptation. Expected outcomes include improved task success rates in unseen scenarios and reduced human intervention for knowledge updates, advancing autonomous systems in robotics, game AI, and workflow automation.
