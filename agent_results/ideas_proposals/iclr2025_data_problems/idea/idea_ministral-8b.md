### Title: "Enhancing Foundation Model Training with Multi-Modal Data Curation"

### Motivation:
Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized machine learning by leveraging vast amounts of data. However, the process of curating and preparing this data remains a critical bottleneck. As FMs become more integrated into diverse applications, the need for effective, scalable, and multi-modal data curation strategies becomes paramount. This research aims to address the challenges of data curation in FM training, focusing on multi-modal data, to enhance the robustness and performance of these models.

### Main Idea:
This research proposes a novel framework for multi-modal data curation tailored to FM training stages. The framework combines traditional data curation techniques with advanced methods for handling diverse data types, such as text, images, and audio. The methodology involves:

1. **Data Filtering and Mixing**: Developing algorithms that can filter and mix data from various modalities to create balanced and representative datasets for FM training.
2. **Repairing and Augmentation**: Implementing techniques for data repair and augmentation that address the unique challenges posed by multi-modal data, such as noise in audio or distortion in images.
3. **Theoretical Guides and Scaling Laws**: Establishing theoretical frameworks to guide data selection and scaling laws for foundation models, ensuring that the curated data is both representative and efficient for training.

The expected outcomes include:
- Improved performance and robustness of FMs trained on curated multi-modal datasets.
- Enhanced interpretability and attribution of model outputs to specific training data.
- Development of practical strategies for data curation that can be easily adopted by the machine learning community.

The potential impact of this research is significant, as it addresses a critical challenge in FM development, fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, and contributes to the creation of more reliable and ethical AI systems.
