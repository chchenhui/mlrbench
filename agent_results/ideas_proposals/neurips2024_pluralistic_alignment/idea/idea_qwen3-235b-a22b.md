1. **Title**: Probabilistic Modeling of Diverse Annotations for Pluralistic AI Alignment  
2. **Motivation**: Current ML models often collapse annotation disagreements into single labels, erasing valuable insights about conflicting human values. This oversimplification risks excluding marginalized perspectives and perpetuating bias. Addressing this gap is critical for applications like hate speech detection, where cultural and ethical nuances shape perceptions of harm.  
3. **Main Idea**: We propose a probabilistic framework that models annotation disagreements as distinct value-driven distributions. Instead of resolving conflicts via majority voting, we train models to learn conditional distributions over labels given annotator metadata (e.g., cultural background, demographics). This involves: (1) collecting rich annotation metadata to identify value clusters, (2) training a neural network to predict label distributions conditioned on value embeddings, and (3) developing fairness-aware loss functions to balance performance across clusters. For evaluation, we will measure inter-cluster consistency, context-aware accuracy, and downstream impact using datasets like the recently released *Cross-Cultural Moral Scenarios* benchmark. Expected outcomes include models that transparently surface value trade-offs, enabling adaptive AI behavior in pluralistic contexts (e.g., moderating content differently for communities with divergent norms). This approach bridges ML and social science insights, offering a scalable technical solution for value-sensitive AI deployment.
