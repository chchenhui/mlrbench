# Behavioral Alignment Metrics: Evaluating LLMs through Psychological Validity

## Motivation
Current LLM evaluation frameworks focus primarily on accuracy, reasoning, and task performance but rarely assess whether model outputs align with genuine human behavioral patterns. This creates a disconnect between AI systems that perform well technically but produce responses that feel unnatural or uncanny to users. By developing evaluation metrics grounded in psychological validity, we can create more human-aligned AI systems that interact more naturally and build appropriate user trust.

## Main Idea
I propose developing a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses LLM outputs based on their alignment with established psychological models of human behavior. This framework would incorporate metrics derived from cognitive science, social psychology, and behavioral economics to evaluate whether model outputs reflect human-like decision-making processes, cognitive biases, emotional intelligence, and social norms. The methodology involves creating benchmark datasets with stimuli designed to elicit specific behavioral patterns, paired with validated human responses. Models would then be scored on how closely their outputs match human behavioral patterns rather than just factual correctness. This approach would allow for targeted improvements in alignment by identifying specific behavioral dimensions where models diverge from human patterns, ultimately leading to AI systems that interact more naturally and build appropriate user trust.
