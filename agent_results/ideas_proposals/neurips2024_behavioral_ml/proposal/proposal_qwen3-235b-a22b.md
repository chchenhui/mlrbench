# Cognitive Architecture-Guided Training for Human-Like Reasoning in Language Models  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language understanding and generation. However, their reasoning processes often lack transparency and alignment with human cognitive mechanisms, limiting their applicability in high-stakes domains like healthcare, education, and collaborative decision-making. While behavioral sciences offer well-validated models of human cognition—such as ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational) and CLARION—these insights remain underexploited in LLM design. Existing efforts to bridge this gap, such as the Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA) framework and LLM-ACTR, demonstrate promise but face challenges in scalability, generalization, and balancing interpretability with performance.  

### Research Objectives  
This research proposes a novel framework to train LLMs with explicit guidance from computational cognitive architectures. The primary objectives are:  
1. To design a hybrid training objective that aligns LLM reasoning pathways with cognitive model "traces" (e.g., step-by-step human problem-solving sequences).  
2. To develop a constrained decoding mechanism that prioritizes token sequences consistent with cognitive architecture predictions.  
3. To evaluate the model’s behavioral congruence with human reasoning using both quantitative metrics and human-in-the-loop experiments.  

### Significance  
By grounding LLMs in formal cognitive models, this work aims to enhance their trustworthiness, interpretability, and alignment with human expectations. Success would advance applications in education (e.g., tutoring systems that mimic human pedagogy), healthcare (e.g., diagnostic tools with explainable reasoning), and human-AI collaboration (e.g., agents that anticipate user needs via cognitive modeling).

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Data Collection  
**Sources**:  
- **Psychological Experiment Datasets**: Syllogistic reasoning tasks (e.g., the "Cognitive Atlas" dataset), moral dilemma responses (e.g., Moral Foundations Theory datasets), and problem-solving protocols from behavioral studies.  
- **Synthetic Cognitive Traces**: Generate step-by-step reasoning sequences using ACT-R and CLARION simulations for tasks like arithmetic reasoning, logical deduction, and planning.  
- **Human-Written Explanations**: Crowdsourced explanations for model outputs, annotated for alignment with cognitive model predictions.  

**Preprocessing**:  
- Tokenize text and align linguistic tokens with cognitive model states (e.g., mapping declarative memory retrievals in ACT-R to specific phrases).  
- Construct parallel data pairs: (input prompt, human/cognitive-trace reasoning steps, final answer).

### 2.2 Cognitive Architectures  
We adopt two complementary architectures:  
1. **ACT-R**: A rule-based model with modular memory systems (declarative, procedural, and perceptual-motor). Its symbolic production rules (e.g., `IF condition THEN action`) guide stepwise reasoning.  
2. **CLARION**: A hybrid architecture combining rule-based and neural network components, emphasizing implicit learning and metacognition.  

**Integration Strategy**:  
- Use ACT-R for structured tasks (e.g., logic puzzles) requiring explicit memory retrieval.  
- Use CLARION for creative or ambiguous tasks (e.g., moral reasoning) where implicit associations dominate.

### 2.3 Hybrid Training Framework  
**Objective Function**:  
We combine language modeling loss ($ \mathcal{L}_{LM} $) with a cognitive alignment loss ($ \mathcal{L}_{align} $):  
$$  
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{LM} + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{align}  
$$  
where $ \lambda $ balances the two components.  

**Components**:  
1. **Language Modeling Loss ($ \mathcal{L}_{LM} $)**: Standard cross-entropy loss for predicting the next token.  
2. **Cognitive Alignment Loss ($ \mathcal{L}_{align} $)**:  
   - **Trace Matching**: Compute KL-divergence between LLM attention weights and cognitive model activation patterns:  
     $$  
     \mathcal{L}_{trace} = D_{KL}\left(p_{cognitive}(h_t) \parallel p_{LLM}(h_t)\right)  
     $$  
     where $ h_t $ is the hidden state at step $ t $.  
   - **Step Consistency**: Penalize deviations from cognitive model-predicted reasoning steps using a contrastive loss:  
     $$  
     \mathcal{L}_{step} = \max\left(0, \gamma - \text{sim}(z_{LLM}, z_{cognitive})\right)  
     $$  
     where $ z $ represents embedding vectors and $ \gamma $ is a margin hyperparameter.  

**Training Pipeline**:  
1. Pretrain the LLM on standard corpora.  
2. Fine-tune using task-specific datasets with the hybrid loss.  
3. Use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize $ \lambda $ dynamically based on human feedback scores.

### 2.4 Constrained Decoding Mechanism  
To enforce cognitive alignment during inference:  
1. **Cognitive State Tracker**: Maintain a hidden state $ s_t $ representing the current step in the cognitive model (e.g., "retrieving declarative memory" in ACT-R).  
2. **Guided Beam Search**: At each decoding step, adjust token probabilities using:  
   $$  
   p(w_t | s_t) \propto p_{LLM}(w_t) \cdot \exp\left(\beta \cdot \text{score}_{cognitive}(w_t, s_t)\right)  
   $$  
   where $ \beta $ controls the strength of cognitive guidance and $ \text{score}_{cognitive} $ measures alignment with $ s_t $.  
3. **Fallback Strategy**: If the LLM deviates significantly from the cognitive trace, trigger a "replanning" module inspired by CLARION’s top-down metacognitive layer.

### 2.5 Experimental Design & Evaluation Metrics  

**Datasets**:  
- **Primary**: Syllogistic reasoning (e.g., "All A are B; Some B are C..."), moral dilemmas (e.g., trolley problems), and arithmetic word problems.  
- **Baselines**: Standard LLMs (e.g., Llama-3), cognitive-aligned models (e.g., CRV, LLM-ACTR), and human responses.  

**Metrics**:  
1. **Behavioral Congruence**:  
   - **Trace Similarity**: Cosine similarity between LLM attention maps and cognitive model activations.  
   - **Step Accuracy**: Proportion of reasoning steps matching cognitive model predictions.  
2. **Task Performance**: Accuracy, F1-score, and BLEU/Rouge scores for final answers.  
3. **Naturalness**: Human evaluation via Likert-scale surveys (e.g., "How human-like is this explanation?").  
4. **Interpretability**: Consistency of explanations (e.g., SHAP values) and faithfulness metrics (Perturbation-based tests).  

**Ablation Studies**:  
- Compare hybrid loss variants (w/wo $ \mathcal{L}_{align} $).  
- Evaluate impact of $ \lambda $ and $ \beta $ on trade-offs between performance and alignment.
