# Research Proposal: Adaptive Contextual Goal Generation for Lifelong Learning via Hierarchical Intrinsic Motivation  

---

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Autonomous lifelong learning agents must adapt to dynamic environments, generalize across tasks, and sustain skill acquisition without human intervention. A key enabler of this capability is *intrinsic motivation* (IM), which drives exploration by rewarding agents for novel or informative experiences (Oudeyer et al., 2007; Pathak et al., 2017). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) extends this by decomposing tasks into reusable sub-skills (Kulkarni et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2021). However, current methods face critical limitations:  
1. **Static Goal Spaces**: Predefined goals restrict adaptation to novel contexts (Sukhbaatar et al., 2018).  
2. **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off**: Agents struggle to balance discovering new skills and refining existing ones (Bellemare et al., 2016).  
3. **Skill Transfer**: Retaining and repurposing learned skills for unseen tasks remains challenging (Colas et al., 2022).  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a **hierarchical intrinsically motivated learning framework** that:  
1. Dynamically generates goals based on environmental context.  
2. Balances exploration and exploitation through meta-reinforcement learning.  
3. Retains and transfers skills across tasks via a modular library.  

### Significance  
This work bridges hierarchical IM with contextual goal generation, addressing long-standing challenges in open-ended learning. It advances the design of autonomous systems capable of lifelong adaptation in real-world settings, such as robotics and personalized AI assistants. By integrating insights from developmental psychology and meta-learning, it contributes theoretical and algorithmic foundations to the Intrinsically Motivated Open-Ended Learning (IMOL) community.

## 2. Methodology  

### Overview  
The proposed framework (Fig. 1) consists of:  
- **Lower-Level Policies**: Curiosity-driven skill learning with prediction error rewards.  
- **Meta-Level Controller**: Adaptive goal generation using an attention-based context analyzer.  
- **Skill Library**: Stores learned skills for reuse and compositional transfer.

### Algorithmic Components  

#### A. Lower-Level Skill Learning  
Each skill policy $\pi_z(a|s, g)$, parameterized by $\theta_z$, solves sub-tasks defined by goal $g \in \mathcal{G}$. Intrinsic rewards are generated via a *forward prediction model* $f_\phi(s_t, a_t)$:  
$$
r_t^{\text{int}} = \|f_\phi(s_t, a_t) - s_{t+1}\|^2_2 + \lambda \cdot H(\pi_z(\cdot|s_t, g)),
$$  
where $H$ denotes policy entropy, and $\lambda$ weights exploration. Skills are trained using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC):  
$$
\max_{\theta_z} \mathbb{E}_{\pi_z} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t \left( r_t^{\text{int}} + \alpha \log \pi_z(a_t|s_t, g) \right) \right],
$$  
with temperature $\alpha$ controlling stochasticity.  

#### B. Meta-Level Goal Generation  
The meta-controller $\mu(g|c)$, parameterized by $\psi$, selects goals based on environmental context $c$. Context is computed via a *temporal self-attention module*:  
$$
c_t = \text{Attn}(h_{t-K:t}; W_Q, W_K, W_V) = \sum_{i=t-K}^t \text{softmax}(W_Q h_i \cdot W_K h_{t-K:t}^\top) W_V h_i,
$$  
where $h_i$ encodes environment statistics (e.g., sensor entropy, skill success rates). The meta-policy is trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO):  
$$
\max_{\psi} \mathbb{E}_{\mu} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R^{\text{meta}}_t \right], \quad R^{\text{meta}}_t = \mathbb{E}_z \left[ \sum_{\tau=0}^{T_z} r_\tau^{\text{int}} \right] - \beta \cdot \text{KL}(\mu_{\text{old}} \| \mu_{\text{new}}),
$$  
where $\beta$ regularizes policy updates.  

#### C. Skill Library and Transfer  
Learned skills are stored in a library $\mathcal{L} = \{(\pi_z, \phi_z)\}$, where $\phi_z$ summarizes skill metadata (e.g., required resources, applicable contexts). For new tasks, skills are retrieved via similarity search over $\phi_z$, followed by few-shot adaptation using Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML):  
$$
\phi_z' \leftarrow \phi_z - \eta \nabla_{\phi_z} \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(\pi_z).
$$

### Experimental Design  

#### Environments  
1. **Procedural 3D Navigation**: Mazes with dynamic obstacles, varying textures, and randomized start-goal pairs.  
2. **Multi-Object Manipulation**: Robotic arm tasks requiring tool composition (e.g., stacking, sorting).  

#### Baselines  
- **HIDIO** (Zhang et al., 2021): Hierarchical IM with entropy minimization.  
- **h-DQN** (Kulkarni et al., 2016): Fixed intrinsic goal hierarchy.  
- **SAC+Curiosity** (Pathak et al., 2017): Flat curiosity-driven RL.  

#### Metrics  
- **Adaptation Speed**: Episode steps to achieve 80% success in new tasks.  
- **Task Coverage**: % of unique tasks solved in a 100-task benchmark.  
- **Skill Reusability**: Ratio of library skills used in novel contexts.  
- **Generalization Error**: Performance drop on tasks with perturbed dynamics.  

#### Training Protocol  
- **Phase 1**: Train lower-level policies in 50 procedurally generated environments.  
- **Phase 2**: Meta-controller training over 1M environment steps.  
- **Phase 3**: Evaluate on 100 unseen tasks with randomized parameters.
