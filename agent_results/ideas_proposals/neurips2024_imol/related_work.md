1. **Title**: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning By Discovering Intrinsic Options (arXiv:2101.06521)
   - **Authors**: Jesse Zhang, Haonan Yu, Wei Xu
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces HIDIO, a hierarchical reinforcement learning method that autonomously discovers task-agnostic options through intrinsic entropy minimization. The approach enhances sample efficiency and success rates in sparse-reward tasks by learning diverse, self-supervised options.

   - **Authors**: Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Emily Denton, Arthur Szlam, Rob Fergus
   - **Summary**: The authors propose an unsupervised learning scheme based on asymmetric self-play to learn sub-goal representations and corresponding low-level policies. This method enables a high-level policy to generate continuous sub-goal vectors, improving performance in complex environments.

3. **Title**: Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning: Integrating Temporal Abstraction and Intrinsic Motivation (arXiv:1604.06057)
   - **Authors**: Tejas D. Kulkarni, Karthik R. Narasimhan, Ardavan Saeedi, Joshua B. Tenenbaum
   - **Summary**: This work presents h-DQN, a framework combining hierarchical value functions with intrinsic motivation. A top-level policy selects intrinsic goals, while a lower-level policy executes actions to achieve these goals, facilitating efficient exploration in environments with sparse feedback.

**Key Challenges**:

1. **Dynamic Goal Adaptation**: Developing mechanisms that allow agents to autonomously adjust their intrinsic goals in response to evolving environmental contexts remains a significant challenge.

2. **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation**: Ensuring that agents effectively balance the pursuit of new knowledge (exploration) with the utilization of existing skills (exploitation) over extended periods is complex.

3. **Skill Retention and Transfer**: Creating systems capable of retaining learned skills and transferring them to novel tasks with minimal supervision is an ongoing research hurdle.

4. **Scalability in Hierarchical Structures**: Designing hierarchical reinforcement learning architectures that scale efficiently with increasing task complexity and environmental variability is challenging.

5. **Intrinsic Motivation Design**: Formulating intrinsic reward mechanisms that effectively drive exploration without leading to suboptimal behaviors or excessive computational overhead is a delicate task.
