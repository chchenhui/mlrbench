Title: GraphDeNovo – Conditional Graph Generative Modeling for PROTAC Design

Motivation:  
Targeted protein degradation via PROTACs offers a powerful strategy to eliminate disease-causing proteins, but designing bifunctional molecules that form stable ternary complexes is laborious and empirically driven. An AI-driven generative framework could dramatically accelerate PROTAC discovery, reduce experimental overhead, and expand the range of “undruggable” targets.

Main Idea:  
We propose GraphDeNovo, a conditional graph-based variational autoencoder that designs PROTAC candidates tailored to a given E3 ligase and protein-of-interest (POI). Binding sites of the ligase and POI are encoded as graphs with geometric and chemical node features. A transformer-enhanced VAE is pre-trained on large chemical graph datasets and fine-tuned on known PROTACs. Generation is conditioned on both pocket graphs and synthesizability metrics. A differentiable docking surrogate evaluates ternary complex stability, feeding a reinforcement-learning loop that steers molecule sampling toward high-stability candidates. An active-learning cycle then selects top predictions for experimental validation, and the resulting data further refine the model. This approach aims to yield potent, synthetically accessible PROTAC libraries, accelerating targeted degrader development.
