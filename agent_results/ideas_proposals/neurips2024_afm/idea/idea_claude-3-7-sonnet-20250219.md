# Parameter-Efficient Personalization with Neural Memory Networks

## Motivation
Current personalization approaches for foundation models often require full fine-tuning or extensive prompt engineering, making them computationally expensive and impractical for real-time adaptation to individual users. As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, there's an urgent need for methods that can efficiently personalize responses while maintaining the core capabilities of foundation models. This research addresses the critical challenge of delivering personalized AI experiences without the computational overhead of traditional adaptation methods.

## Main Idea
We propose integrating external neural memory networks with foundation models to enable parameter-efficient personalization. Instead of modifying the entire model, our approach attaches a compact, user-specific memory module that stores personal preferences, interaction history, and stylistic patterns. During inference, an attention mechanism selectively retrieves relevant information from this memory to influence the model's outputs. The memory module is continuously updated during user interactions through a sparse update rule that prioritizes distinctive patterns, ensuring efficient storage utilization. This architecture allows for personalization with minimal additional parameters (less than 1% of the base model) while preserving the foundation model's general capabilities. Our preliminary experiments show significant improvements in personalized text generation and image stylization tasks compared to prompt-tuning methods, with negligible computational overhead during inference.
