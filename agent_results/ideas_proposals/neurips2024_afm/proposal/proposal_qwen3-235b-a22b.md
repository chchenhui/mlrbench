# Dynamic Sparse Adapters for Scalable Personalized Foundation Models  

## Introduction  

### Background  
Foundation models like large language models (LLMs) and multimodal vision-language systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in zero-shot and few-shot settings. However, real-world deployment increasingly demands **personalization**—customizing models to individual user preferences, usage patterns, and domain-specific needs—without sacrificing efficiency. Current personalization methods face trade-offs: full fine-tuning adapts models comprehensively but incurs prohibitive computational costs for large-scale deployment, while parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and dense adapter layers reduce trainable parameters at the cost of memory scalability due to storage of user-specific modules. Recent works (e.g., **AdaLoRA**, **Light-PEFT**, **QEFT**) have advanced parameter efficiency but fail to address the compounding memory overhead when scaling personalization to millions of users. This work proposes **dynamic sparse adapters**, a novel architecture that combines sparsity-constrained optimization, meta-learning, and reinforcement learning (RL) to enable **5–10× memory reduction per user** compared to dense adapters while preserving performance.  

### Research Objectives  
Our research addresses three core challenges from the literature review:  
1. **Efficiency-Performance Trade-off**: Existing PEFT methods like LoRA add dense low-rank adapters, increasing memory footprint linearly with users.  
2. **Scalability**: Personalizing foundation models at scale remains impractical under edge-device constraints.  
3. **Dynamic Sparsity**: Prior static sparse fine-tuning approaches (e.g., **PEQA**) lack user-specific pathway adaptability.  

The objectives are:  
- Design lightweight dynamic sparse adapters that activate only 1–5% of a foundation model’s parameters per user.  
- Develop a hybrid **meta-learning + RL framework** to initialize and dynamically optimize sparse pathways.  
- Demonstrate scalability on 10⁴+ users with minimal performance degradation compared to full fine-tuning.  

### Significance  
This work directly advances NeurIPS workshops on adaptive foundation models by enabling:  
- **Cost-effective deployment** of personalized AI on edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT).  
- **Privacy-preserving personalization** via user-specific adapter storage without raw data exposure.  
- **Foundational tools** for applications like personalized chatbots, content moderation, and creativity-enhancing image generators.

## Methodology  

### Research Design  
We decompose the foundation model’s parameters into **global weights $ \theta \in \mathbb{R}^{d} $** (shared across users) and **user-specific dynamic sparse adapters $ \Delta \theta^{(u)} $** parameterized by a gating mechanism $ G(u; \phi) $:  
$$  
\Delta \theta^{(u)} = A(u) \odot M(G(u; \phi)),  
$$  
where:  
- $ A(u) \in \mathbb{R}^{d} $: continuous adapter parameters for user $ u $.  
- $ M(G(u; \phi)) \in \{0,1\}^{d} $: binary mask generated by the gate network $ G $ with parameters $ \phi $.  
- $ \odot $: element-wise multiplication.  

The gate network $ G $ uses user embeddings (e.g., behavior history, demographic data) to select subnetworks that maximize task-specific reward.  

#### Dynamic Sparsity Constraint  
We enforce sparsity via the $ \ell_0 $-norm constraint $ \| M(G(u; \phi)) \|_0 \leq s $, where $ s \ll d $. To optimize this non-differentiable constraint, we relax the mask using Concrete dropout (Maddison et al., 2017):  
$$  
M_i = \sigma\left( \frac{\log \alpha_i + \text{Gumbel}(0,1)}{\tau} \right),  
$$  
where $ \alpha_i $ is gate parameter $ i $, $ \sigma $ is the sigmoid function, and $ \tau $ controls sparsity temperature.  

#### Meta-Learning for Adapter Initialization  
To accelerate adaptation to new users, we meta-learn $ \theta $ and $ A_0 $ (initial adapter parameters) using Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML):  
$$  
\theta^*, A_0^* = \arg\min_{\theta, A_0} \sum_{u \in \mathcal{T}_{\text{train}}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}\left(\theta + A(u)', \mathcal{D}^{\text{val}}_u\right),  
$$  
where $ A(u)' $ is $ A_0 $ updated via one or more gradient steps on user $ u $’s training data $ \mathcal{D}^{\text{train}}_u $.  

#### Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Gating  
The gate network uses proximal policy optimization (PPO) to maximize reward $ r(u) $ (task accuracy penalized by sparsity):  
$$  
\max_{\phi} \mathbb{E}_{u \sim \mathcal{U}} \left[ r(u) - \lambda \| M(G(u; \phi)) \|_0 \right],  
$$  
where $ \lambda $ balances performance and sparsity.  

### Data Collection  
We evaluate on three personalized tasks:  
1. **Text Generation**: PersonaChat dialogue personalization.  
2. **Image Customization**: User-specific style transfer on CelebA.  
3. **Multimodal Retrieval**: Personalized image-text matching on CLIP-co-occurrence data.  

For each task:  
- **User Embeddings**: Generated via PCA of user interaction logs (text dialogues) or pre-trained style encoders (images).  
- **Baselines**: Full fine-tuning, LoRA, dense adapters, and Light-PEFT.  

### Experimental Design  

#### Training Pipeline  
1. **Meta-training Phase**:  
   - Sample batches of “pseudo users” from public datasets.  
   - Optimize $ \theta $ and $ A_0 $ with MAML on task losses $ \mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}}, \mathcal{L}_{\text{LPIPS}} $.  
2. **Adaptation Phase**:  
   - For new user $ u $, finetune $ A(u) $ with task loss and sparsity penalty.  
   - Train gate policy $ G(u;\phi) $ via RL to maximize task reward.  

#### Evaluation Metrics  
- **Performance**: BLEU-4 ($ \uparrow $) for text, FID ($ \downarrow $) and LPIPS ($ \downarrow $) for images.  
- **Efficiency**: Memory per user (MB), inference latency (ms/query), and training cost (GPU hours).  
- **Scalability**: Throughput at 10⁴ users on edge devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson).  

#### Ablation Studies  
- **Sparsity Budget**: Performance vs. $ s/d \in \{0.5\%, 1\%, 5\%\} $.  
- **Gate Architectures**: Comparing Transformer-, MLP-, and attention-based gates.
