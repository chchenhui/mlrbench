Title  
Dynamic Sparse Adapters: A Scalable Framework for Personalized Foundation Models  

Introduction  
Background and Motivation  
Foundation models (FMs) such as BERT, GPT, and Stable Diffusion have demonstrated impressive zero- and few-shot capabilities across language, vision, and multimodal tasks. However, large-scale personalization remains a key challenge. Conventional personalization techniques—full fine-tuning, dense adapters, prompt tuning, or LoRA—either incur prohibitive memory/computation costs per user or compromise on task performance. Meanwhile, emerging applications (personalized chat assistants, custom image generation, adaptive recommendation systems) demand that millions of end-users each have a “personalized copy” of a base model, yet run on resource-constrained hardware.  

Research Objectives  
We propose Dynamic Sparse Adapters (DSA), a parameter- and compute-efficient mechanism to personalize a foundation model for each user. Our objectives are to:  
1.  Design a sparsity-constrained adapter architecture that shares most parameters globally while retaining user-specific weights only on a small subset of model units.  
2.  Develop a gating network that dynamically selects sparse pathways in the FM conditioned on a user embedding, minimizing per-user memory footprint.  
3.  Combine meta-learning for fast adapter initialization with reinforcement-learning (RL) for optimizing the gating policy, ensuring stable training and high personalization accuracy.  
4.  Evaluate the DSA framework at scale on diverse language and vision tasks, measuring trade-offs among personalization quality, memory overhead, inference speed, and privacy preservation.  

Significance  
By reducing per-user adapter size by 5–10× compared to dense adapters (e.g., LoRA), DSA paves the way for large-scale deployment of personalized FMs on edge devices and servers alike. The combination of sparse pathways and dynamic gating addresses catastrophic forgetting in continual updates and alleviates privacy concerns: user updates need only store a small adapter vector rather than full model weights.  

Methodology  
Our methodology consists of three components: (a) the DSA architecture, (b) meta-learning–based adapter initialization, and (c) RL-driven gating optimization. We then detail data collection, training procedures, and evaluation protocols.  

1. Dynamic Sparse Adapter Architecture  
We denote the pretrained foundation model by $f_\theta(\cdot)$ with parameters $\theta\in\mathbb{R}^d$. For each user $u_i$, we introduce a sparse adapter module parameterized by $\phi_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and a gating network $g_\psi:\mathbb{R}^m\!\to\![0,1]^d$ parameterized by $\psi$. A fixed user embedding $\mathbf{u}_i\in\mathbb{R}^m$ encodes user preferences or historical data.  

At inference time for input $x$, the personalized model’s output is:  
$$
\hat y = f_{\theta + g_\psi(\mathbf{u}_i)\odot \phi_i}(x)\,,
$$  
where $\odot$ is element-wise multiplication. The gating vector $g_\psi(\mathbf{u}_i)$ activates a small subset of $\phi_i$’s dimensions: if $[g_\psi(\mathbf{u}_i)]_j=0$, then adapter weight $\phi_{i,j}$ is zeroed out. We enforce a sparsity budget $k \ll d$ such that  
$$
\|g_\psi(\mathbf{u}_i)\|_0 \le k,\quad\forall i\,,
$$  
ensuring that each user only stores and updates $k$ adapter weights rather than full $d$ dimensions.  

Architecture Details  
- Gating network $g_\psi$ is implemented as a two-layer MLP with hard-concrete gates:  
  $$  
    g_\psi(\mathbf{u}_i)_j = \mathrm{HardConcrete}\big(\sigma(w_j^\top \mathbf{u}_i + b_j)\big)\,,
  $$  
  where $\sigma$ is sigmoid and hard-concrete relaxation enables differentiable Bernoulli sampling.  
- Adapter $\phi_i$ is a sparse vector in the same dimension as $\theta$, but since only $k$ entries are ever nonzero, memory cost per user is $O(k)$.  
- The overall personalized parameter vector is $\theta + \Delta_i$, where $\Delta_i = g_\psi(\mathbf{u}_i)\odot \phi_i$.  

2. Meta-Learning for Rapid Adapter Initialization  
To enable fast personalization for new users, we adopt a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) scheme. Let $\mathcal{U}_\text{meta}$ be a set of $N$ users with their own data $\mathcal{D}_i=\{(x_{ij},y_{ij})\}$. We learn a meta-initialization $\phi_0$ and gating parameters $\psi$ by solving:  
$$  
\min_{\phi_0,\psi}\sum_{i=1}^N \mathcal{L}_\text{meta}\Big(f_{\theta + g_\psi(\mathbf{u}_i)\odot \phi_i^\prime} , \mathcal{D}_i^{\text{val}}\Big)\quad\text{s.t.}\;\phi_i^\prime = \phi_0 - \alpha\nabla_{\phi}\mathcal{L}\big(f_{\theta + g_\psi(\mathbf{u}_i)\odot \phi_0}, \mathcal{D}_i^{\text{train}}\big)\,.  
$$  
Here $\alpha$ is the inner-loop step size and $\mathcal{L}$ is the task loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification or token-level negative log-likelihood for text). This meta-training yields an adapter init $\phi_0$ that can be fine-tuned in one or two gradient steps per new user.  

3. Reinforcement-Learning for Gating Optimization  
While meta-learning aligns $\phi_0$ across users, we require a more expressive method to optimize the discrete gating policy under the sparsity constraint. We formulate the gating network as an RL agent: for each user $u_i$, the agent chooses a mask $g$ (an action) and receives reward  
$$
R = -\mathcal{L}\big(f_{\theta + g\odot \phi_i}, \mathcal{D}_i^{\text{val}}\big) - \beta\,\|g\|_0,
$$  
where $\beta$ penalties larger mask size. We maximize expected reward $J(\psi) = \mathbb{E}_{g\sim\pi_\psi(\cdot|\mathbf{u}_i)}[R]$ using REINFORCE with baseline and entropy regularization to encourage exploration.  

4. Overall Training Algorithm  
Algorithmic Steps  
1. Initialize $\theta$ from pretrained FM, randomly initialize $\phi_0,\psi$.  
2. Meta-Iteration:  
   a. Sample a batch of users $\{u_i\}$ from $\mathcal{U}_\text{meta}$.  
   b. For each $u_i$, compute one inner-loop update $\phi_i^\prime = \phi_0 - \alpha\nabla_{\phi}\mathcal{L}(f_{\theta+g_\psi(\mathbf{u}_i)\odot\phi_0},\mathcal{D}_i^{\text{train}})$.  
   c. Update $(\phi_0,\psi)$ by minimizing sum of meta-losses on $\mathcal{D}_i^{\text{val}}$.  
3. Gating RL:  
   a. For each user $u_i$, sample gating masks $g^{(t)}\sim \pi_\psi(\cdot|\mathbf{u}_i)$.  
   b. Compute rewards $R^{(t)}$ on validation split.  
   c. Update $\psi$ via policy gradient:  
      $$\nabla_\psi J(\psi)\approx \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T (R^{(t)}-b)\nabla_\psi\log\pi_\psi(g^{(t)}|\mathbf{u}_i)\,. $$  
   d. Periodically fine-tune $\phi_i$ on $\mathcal{D}_i^{\text{train}}$ while holding $\psi$ fixed.  
4. Repeat steps 2–3 until convergence.  

Data Collection and Tasks  
We will evaluate DSA on both language and vision personalization scenarios:  
- Language Personalization:  
  • Personalized text generation (e.g., user-specific writing style) using GPT-style model and Reddit comment data partitioned by user.  
  • Task adaptation (summarization, sentiment analysis) with few examples per user (5–20 shots).  
- Vision Personalization:  
  • Text-to-image personalization (e.g., consistent object appearance/style) using Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth-style datasets.  
  • Style transfer and single-subject capture for thousands of users.  
- Multimodal Adaptation (optional extension):  
  • Instruction-based robot control with user-specific preferences.  

Experimental Design  
Baselines  
- Full fine-tuning of $\theta$ per user.  
- Dense Adapter (e.g., LoRA) without gating.  
- AdaLoRA and Light-PEFT with parameter budgets matched to DSA’s $k$.  
- Prompt tuning or prefix tuning.  

Evaluation Metrics  
- Personalization Accuracy: task loss (perplexity, classification accuracy, FID) on held-out user data.  
- Memory Footprint: number of nonzero adapter parameters per user.  
- Inference Latency: tokens/sec or images/sec on GPU/CPU/edge.  
- Adaptation Time: time to personalize a new user.  
- Privacy Leakage: membership inference attack success rate on adapter weights vs. full-model weights.  

Protocol  
1. Simulate 1,000 users to meta-train $\phi_0,\psi$.  
2. Sample 100 unseen users; measure adaptation performance after one inner gradient step (5–20 examples) and after full few-shot.  
3. Vary sparsity budget $k\in\{1\%,5\%,10\%\times d\}$ to trace accuracy vs. memory curves.  
4. Benchmark inference speed on desktop GPU (A100), mobile GPU (Jetson), and CPU (Intel i7).  
5. Conduct privacy attacks on adapter parameters to evaluate information leakage.  

Hyperparameter Tuning  
We will conduct grid searches over $\alpha\in\{10^{-4},10^{-3}\}$, meta-batch size $\in\{8,16\}$, RL learning rate $\in\{10^{-5},10^{-4}\}$, and sparsity regularizer $\beta\in\{0.1,1.0\}$. All experiments will be repeated with three random seeds for statistical significance.  

Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Anticipated Results  
- Memory Reduction: We expect DSA to achieve a 5–10× decrease in per-user adapter size compared to dense adapters at equivalent personalization accuracy.  
- Fast Adaptation: With meta-initialized $\phi_0$, new users should attain >90% of full performance with just one gradient update on $<20$ examples.  
- Inference Efficiency: Dynamic gating will incur negligible overhead ($<2\%$ latency increase) while reducing memory I/O.  
- Privacy Preservation: Smaller adapter sizes and on-device adaptation will lower membership inference risks by at least 20% relative to full-model tuning.  

Broader Impacts  
1. Democratizing Personalized AI: DSA enables deployment of customized language and vision models on mobile and embedded devices, fostering inclusive access.  
2. Continual Learning: The sparse adapter mechanism naturally extends to continual weight updates, mitigating catastrophic forgetting by localizing user-specific knowledge.  
3. Efficient Resource Utilization: Data centers and edge servers benefit from drastically reduced storage and bandwidth requirements when serving millions of users.  
4. Research Synergy: By integrating meta-learning and RL in the context of sparse adaptation, this work bridges efficient fine-tuning, dynamic adaptation, and personalization—key themes in modern ML.  

Future Directions  
- Retrieval-Augmented DSA: Incorporate a dynamic retrieval module that conditions gating on external knowledge sources (e.g., personal document corpora or web news).  
- Token/Prompt Tuning Integration: Explore a hybrid of sparse adapters and prompt tuning where discrete prompts trigger adapter pathways.  
- Multimodal Extension: Apply DSA to vision-language models (e.g., CLIP, DALL·E) for personalized multimodal generation.  
- Privacy-Enhancing Mechanisms: Combine DSA with federated learning or differential privacy to further protect user data during meta-training and adaptation.  

In summary, Dynamic Sparse Adapters present a principled, scalable, and efficient framework for personalized foundation models. By activating only the most relevant pathways for each user, we achieve strong personalization with minimal resource overhead, unlocking new possibilities for customized AI across devices and applications.
