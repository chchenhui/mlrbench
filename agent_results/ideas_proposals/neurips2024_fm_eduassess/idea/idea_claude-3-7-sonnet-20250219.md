# Dual-Stage Multimodal Evaluation Framework for Foundation Models in Educational Assessment

## Motivation
Educational assessments increasingly involve complex, multimodal tasks that require creative thinking and high-order reasoning. However, current large foundation models lack adequate explainability and accountability when evaluating such responses, limiting their adoption in high-stakes assessments. Educational stakeholders need transparent systems that can reliably score nuanced, multi-format student work while providing clear reasoning behind their evaluations to build trust in AI-assisted assessment.

## Main Idea
I propose a dual-stage framework that combines foundation model evaluation with human-interpretable reasoning. In the first stage, a multimodal foundation model processes student responses (text, diagrams, audio, etc.) and generates both a preliminary score and a detailed reasoning trace. The second stage employs a specialized evaluation module fine-tuned on educational rubrics that validates the reasoning trace against established assessment criteria. This module can challenge or refine the initial evaluation, creating a transparent dialogue between scoring stages. The system generates a final assessment report that includes the score, key observations about the response, alignment with rubric elements, and suggested improvements. By making the evaluation process explainable through this dual-stage approach, we increase assessment validity and stakeholder trust while maintaining the powerful pattern recognition capabilities of foundation models.
