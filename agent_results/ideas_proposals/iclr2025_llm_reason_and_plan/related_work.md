1. **Title**: AdaPlanner: Adaptive Planning from Feedback with Language Models (arXiv:2305.16653)
   - **Authors**: Haotian Sun, Yuchen Zhuang, Lingkai Kong, Bo Dai, Chao Zhang
   - **Summary**: AdaPlanner introduces a closed-loop approach that enables large language models (LLMs) to refine their self-generated plans adaptively in response to environmental feedback. The method employs both in-plan and out-of-plan refinement strategies and utilizes a code-style prompt structure to facilitate plan generation across various tasks. Additionally, it incorporates a skill discovery mechanism that leverages successful plans as few-shot exemplars, enhancing planning and refinement with fewer task demonstrations. Experiments in ALFWorld and MiniWoB++ environments demonstrate that AdaPlanner outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while utilizing significantly fewer samples.

   - **Authors**: Gautier Dagan, Frank Keller, Alex Lascarides
   - **Summary**: This paper presents LLM Dynamic Planner (LLM-DP), a neuro-symbolic framework where an LLM collaborates with a traditional planner to solve embodied tasks. LLM-DP addresses the challenges of complex, multi-step reasoning by combining the strengths of symbolic planners and LLMs, enabling efficient and effective planning in environments with noisy observations and high uncertainty. The approach demonstrates faster and more efficient problem-solving in the Alfworld environment compared to a naive LLM ReAct baseline.
