**1. Title:** **Adaptive Inference Planner (AIP): Enhancing Large Language Model Planning via Dynamic Computational Resource Allocation and Reinforcement Learning**

**2. Introduction**

*   **Background:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent capabilities in complex cognitive tasks, including reasoning and planning [Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023]. Their ability to process and generate coherent text allows them to tackle problems traditionally requiring structured algorithms or symbolic methods, such as generating step-by-step plans for tasks ranging from everyday activities (e.g., cooking recipes) to complex problem-solving in domains like robotics and software development [Ahn et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2023]. However, a significant challenge lies in the efficiency and adaptability of LLMs during the planning process. Current inference paradigms typically employ a fixed computational budget (e.g., a set number of generation steps, fixed beam width, consistent model size) regardless of the specific demands of the planning sub-problem being addressed [Wei et al., 2022]. This rigidity leads to suboptimal performance: computational resources may be wasted on simple planning steps, while complex or critical steps might be underserviced, resulting in incomplete or flawed plans.

    This limitation is particularly relevant to the goals of the *Workshop on Reasoning and Planning for Large Language Models*, which emphasizes enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities through methods like reinforcement learning (RL), optimizing post-training processes, and developing efficient inference techniques (Workshop Topics 1 & 2). Existing research has started exploring adaptive planning and inference. For instance, AdaPlanner uses environmental feedback to refine plans [Sun et al., 2023], while LLM-DP integrates LLMs with traditional planners for dynamic environments [Dagan et al., 2023]. Approaches like AdaLLaVA [Xu et al., 2025] and the work by Noh et al. [2025] demonstrate dynamic resource allocation for multimodal models and wireless environments, respectively, highlighting the growing interest in adaptive computation. Several preprints [arXiv:2304.98765, arXiv:2305.13579, arXiv:2303.54321, arXiv:2302.67890, arXiv:2301.12345, arXiv:2306.78901] specifically target adaptive inference, meta-reasoning, and RL for optimizing LLM computation, often focusing on planning tasks. However, a comprehensive framework that integrates learnable meta-reasoning for predicting step difficulty with an RL-trained policy for dynamically allocating diverse computational resources specifically within the LLM's planning generation process remains an open area. Addressing the key challenges identified in the literature – the complexity of dynamic resource allocation, balancing efficiency and performance, adaptability across tasks, seamless integration, and robust evaluation – is critical for advancing scalable LLM reasoning.

*   **Research Objectives:** This research proposes the development and evaluation of the **Adaptive Inference Planner (AIP)**, a novel mechanism integrated within LLMs to optimize the planning process through dynamic computational resource allocation. The primary objectives are:
    1.  **Design and Implement the AIP Framework:** Develop the core components of AIP, including a meta-reasoning module to assess planning step difficulty/uncertainty and a resource allocation module to dynamically adjust computational effort during inference.
    2.  **Develop a Meta-Reasoning Component:** Investigate and implement techniques for the LLM to predict the anticipated difficulty or uncertainty associated with generating the next part of a plan (e.g., a sub-goal, an action). This could involve methods like analyzing internal model states (e.g., attention patterns, token probabilities), using auxiliary prediction heads, or prompting techniques.
    3.  **Formulate and Train an RL-based Allocation Policy:** Define a reinforcement learning problem where the AIP agent learns an optimal policy for allocating computational resources (e.g., inference steps, beam search width, tool invocation, model selection). The reward function will be designed to explicitly balance planning success, plan quality, and computational cost.
    4.  **Integrate AIP with a Base LLM:** Seamlessly integrate the trained AIP mechanism into the inference loop of a state-of-the-art LLM suitable for planning tasks.
    5.  **Empirically Evaluate AIP:** Rigorously evaluate the performance of AIP-enhanced LLMs on diverse planning benchmarks, comparing against relevant baselines in terms of plan success rate, plan quality, computational efficiency, and overall cost-effectiveness. This aligns with Workshop Topic 3 (Benchmarking).

*   **Significance:** This research directly addresses crucial challenges in scaling LLM reasoning and planning capabilities, contributing significantly to the workshop's themes.
    1.  **Enhanced Efficiency:** AIP promises substantial reductions in computational cost and latency for planning tasks by allocating resources judiciously, making complex LLM planning more feasible and accessible (contributing to Workshop Topic 2).
    2.  **Improved Performance:** By focusing computational power on critical or difficult planning steps, AIP aims to improve the success rate and quality of generated plans, particularly for long-horizon or complex tasks.
    3.  **Scalability:** Dynamic resource allocation is a key enabler for scaling LLMs to handle increasingly complex planning problems where uniform high computational cost is prohibitive.
    4.  **Advancing Adaptive Inference:** This work will contribute novel techniques for meta-reasoning about computational needs within LLMs and using RL to learn adaptive inference strategies, advancing the state-of-the-art discussed in the literature [e.g., arXiv:2305.13579, arXiv:2303.54321].
    5.  **Broader Applicability:** The principles of AIP could potentially be extended beyond planning to other reasoning-intensive tasks like mathematical problem solving, code generation, or complex question answering, and potentially inform reasoning in multi-modal and embodied settings (Workshop Topics 4 & 5).

**3. Methodology**

*   **Research Design Overview:** This research employs a constructive and empirical methodology. We will first design and implement the AIP framework, integrating meta-reasoning and resource allocation components into a base LLM. An RL agent controlling the resource allocation will be trained using simulated planning episodes. Finally, the AIP-enhanced LLM will be rigorously evaluated on standard planning benchmarks against non-adaptive baselines.

*   **Data Collection and Generation:**
    *   **Base LLM:** We will leverage a pre-trained LLM known for strong reasoning and instruction-following capabilities (e.g., models from the GPT family, Llama, Flan-T5, or potentially newer models like OpenAI's o1 if accessible).
    *   **Planning Benchmarks:** We will utilize established benchmarks that test diverse planning capabilities. Potential candidates include:
        *   **ALFWorld:** Embodied task planning based on natural language instructions [Shridhar et al., 2020], used by AdaPlanner [Sun et al., 2023] and LLM-DP [Dagan et al., 2023].
        *   **Blocks World:** A classic symbolic planning domain, adaptable for LLM evaluation.
        *   **PDDL-based Domains:** Problems defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language, potentially translated into natural language prompts for the LLM (e.g., logistics, scheduling).
        *   **WebShop/MiniWoB++:** Environments requiring planning and interaction with web interfaces or GUIs [Yao et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2017].
    *   **RL Training Data:** Training data for the RL agent will be generated through interactions within simulated planning environments derived from the chosen benchmarks. The LLM (initially potentially guided or exploring randomly with AIP) will attempt to solve planning problems, generating state-action-reward trajectories. We may also incorporate data from successful plans (expert demonstrations) to bootstrap the learning process.

*   **Adaptive Inference Planner (AIP) Design:**
    *   **Core Architecture:** AIP will operate within the LLM's generative inference loop. At each potential planning step (e.g., before generating the next action or sub-goal), the AIP modules will be invoked.
    *   **Meta-Reasoning Module ($f_{meta}$):** This module estimates the difficulty or uncertainty of the upcoming generation step.
        *   *Input:* Current state $s_t$ (including problem description, goal, current plan prefix $p_t$, possibly internal LLM hidden states).
        *   *Output:* A difficulty score $d_t \in \mathbb{R}$ or a vector representing uncertainty dimensions.
        *   *Implementation:* We will explore several methods:
            1.  *Predictive Uncertainty:* Using techniques like Monte Carlo dropout or querying model perplexity/entropy over the next few tokens.
            2.  *Auxiliary Prediction Head:* Training a small network head on top of the LLM's intermediate representations to predict downstream task success probability or required computation, potentially supervised using outcomes from previous planning attempts.
            3.  *Self-Correction/Critique:* Prompting the LLM itself to assess the complexity or ambiguity of the current planning state. E.g., "How complex is the next step? Rate 1-5."
        *   *Mathematical Sketch:* $d_t = f_{meta}(s_t, p_t, g; \theta_{meta})$, where $g$ is the goal and $\theta_{meta}$ are the parameters of the meta-reasoning module (either implicit within the LLM or explicit).
    *   **Resource Allocation Module ($\pi_{alloc}$):** This module acts as the RL agent's policy function.
        *   *Input:* The difficulty assessment $d_t$ from the meta-reasoning module and potentially other contextual information from $s_t$.
        *   *Output:* An action $a_t$ specifying the computational resources to allocate for the *next* generation step.
        *   *Resource Dimensions:* The action space $A$ will likely be discrete or discretized continuous, controlling resources such as:
            1.  *Inference Steps:* Number of decoding steps or layers to use (if applicable via techniques like layer dropping).
            2.  *Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Depth/Complexity:* Length or structural complexity of intermediate reasoning steps generated.
            3.  *Beam Search Width:* Number of beams to maintain during decoding.
            4.  *Tool Use:* Decision to invoke external tools (e.g., a calculator, a search engine, a specialized symbolic planner).
            5.  *Model Selection:* Potentially switching between a smaller, faster model for simple steps and a larger, more powerful model for complex steps (if multiple models are available).
        *   *Mathematical Sketch:* $a_t = \pi_{alloc}(s_t, d_t; \theta_{alloc})$, where $\theta_{alloc}$ represents the parameters of the allocation policy network.

*   **Reinforcement Learning Framework:**
    *   **Objective:** Train the allocation policy $\pi_{alloc}$ to maximize the expected cumulative reward, balancing plan success, quality, and computational cost.
    *   **State ($S$):** The state $s_t$ provided to the RL agent will encapsulate the current planning progress, including the problem definition, goal, plan generated so far, the latest meta-reasoning assessment $d_t$, and potentially historical resource usage.
    *   **Action ($A$):** The resource allocation vector $a_t$ chosen by the policy $\pi_{alloc}$.
    *   **Reward Function ($R$):** The reward function is critical for achieving the desired balance. It will be computed at the end of a planning episode (or potentially with intermediate signals):
        $$ R_{total} = w_s \cdot R_{success} + w_q \cdot R_{quality} - w_c \cdot C_{compute} $$
        Where:
        *   $R_{success} \in \{0, 1\}$ indicates whether the final plan successfully achieves the goal.
        *   $R_{quality}$ measures the quality of the successful plan (e.g., inverse of plan length, score based on intermediate checkpoints). Can be $0$ if the plan fails.
        *   $C_{compute}$ represents the total computational cost incurred during the planning episode, measured using metrics defined below (e.g., total tokens processed, weighted sum of resource usage).
        *   $w_s, w_q, w_c$ are weighting hyperparameters to balance the objectives. These will be tuned carefully.
    *   **RL Algorithm:** We propose using a policy gradient algorithm suitable for potentially complex state and action spaces, such as **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** [Schulman et al., 2017], known for its stability and sample efficiency. Alternatively, if the action space is manageable, a value-based method like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) [Mnih et al., 2015] or its variants could be considered.
    *   **Training Procedure:** The LLM integrated with the (initially untrained) AIP will attempt planning tasks. Trajectories $(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$ will be collected. The RL algorithm will update the parameters $\theta_{alloc}$ of the allocation policy based on these trajectories to maximize expected return.

*   **Experimental Design:**
    *   **Baselines:**
        1.  *Fixed Low Resource LLM:* Base LLM with minimal computation (e.g., greedy decoding, short CoT).
        2.  *Fixed Medium Resource LLM:* Base LLM with moderate computation (e.g., small beam search, standard CoT).
        3.  *Fixed High Resource LLM:* Base LLM with extensive computation (e.g., large beam search, complex CoT).
        4.  *(Optional) State-of-the-art Adaptive Methods:* If feasible, comparison against methods like AdaPlanner [Sun et al., 2023] or re-implementations of adaptive computation ideas [e.g., arXiv:2304.98765] on the same benchmarks.
    *   **Experimental Procedure:**
        1.  Train the AIP RL agent on a designated training set of planning problems.
        2.  Evaluate the trained AIP-LLM on a held-out test set from the chosen benchmarks.
        3.  Run baseline models on the same test set.
        4.  Collect performance and computational cost metrics for all models.
        5.  **Ablation Studies:** Evaluate the contribution of different components:
            *   Effectiveness of the meta-reasoning module (compare AIP with random or heuristic allocation).
            *   Impact of different resource types (e.g., AIP controlling only CoT vs. CoT + beam width).
            *   Sensitivity to RL reward function weights ($w_s, w_q, w_c$).
    *   **Computational Cost Measurement:** Define cost metrics consistently across experiments:
        *   *Token Count:* Total number of tokens processed by the LLM (input + output).
        *   *Wall-Clock Time:* Inference latency (averaged over multiple runs).
        *   *FLOPs Estimate:* Approximate Floating Point Operations, if feasible to estimate.
        *   *Weighted Resource Cost:* A composite score $C_{compute} = \sum_{t} c(a_t)$, where $c(a_t)$ is a predefined cost for the resources used at step $t$.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Plan Success Rate:** Percentage of tasks where a valid plan achieving the goal is generated.
    2.  **Plan Quality:** Metrics appropriate for the domain (e.g., plan length, number of steps, optimality ratio if ground truth is available).
    3.  **Computational Cost:** Average measured cost (Tokens, Time, FLOPs, Weighted Cost) per task.
    4.  **Efficiency Frontier:** Plotting Success Rate vs. Computational Cost to visualize the trade-offs achieved by different methods (Pareto frontier).
    5.  **Resource Allocation Analysis:** Statistics on how AIP allocates different resources based on perceived difficulty.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

*   **Expected Outcomes:**
    1.  **A Functional AIP Framework:** A robust implementation of the Adaptive Inference Planner integrated with a base LLM, capable of dynamic resource allocation during planning.
    2.  **Trained AIP Agent:** An RL policy demonstrating effective resource allocation strategies learned through interaction and reward optimization.
    3.  **Empirical Results:** Comprehensive benchmark results demonstrating the quantitative benefits of AIP compared to fixed-resource baselines, showcasing improvements in efficiency (reduced cost for similar performance) and/or effectiveness (better performance for similar or slightly increased cost, especially on complex tasks). This directly addresses Workshop Topic 3 requirements.
    4.  **Analysis and Insights:** Detailed analysis of the meta-reasoning component's accuracy, the learned allocation policies, and the impact of different design choices (resource types, reward formulations) through ablation studies. This will shed light on how LLMs can perform effective meta-reasoning for computational management.
    5.  **Publications and Dissemination:** High-quality publications detailing the AIP methodology, results, and analysis, potentially submitted to relevant ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) and workshops like this one. Open-sourcing the code and potentially trained model components would be a valuable contribution.

*   **Impact:**
    1.  **Scientific Contribution:** This research will advance the understanding of efficient inference in large models (Workshop Topic 2), particularly for complex, multi-step reasoning tasks like planning (Workshop Topic 1). It will provide novel methods for integrating meta-reasoning and RL for adaptive computation, contributing directly to addressing the challenges outlined in the literature review (dynamic allocation complexity, efficiency/performance balance, adaptability).
    2.  **Practical Relevance:** By significantly improving the computational efficiency of LLM-based planning, AIP could make these powerful tools more practical and cost-effective for real-world applications, such as automated workflow generation, robotics control, interactive assistants, and complex decision support systems.
    3.  **Foundation for Future Work:** The AIP framework could serve as a foundation for exploring adaptive computation in other LLM tasks (e.g., code generation, mathematical reasoning) and in more complex settings like multi-modal reasoning (Workshop Topic 4) or multi-agent collaborative planning (Workshop Topic 5). The learned meta-reasoning capabilities might also offer insights into model uncertainty and explainability (Workshop Topic 5).
    4.  **Addressing Workshop Goals:** This proposal directly aligns with the workshop's focus on training methodologies (RL for post-training optimization), efficient inference for complex tasks, benchmarking, and exploring broader topics like uncertainty and dynamic resource management in LLMs. The findings will provide valuable insights and potential solutions relevant to the workshop's discussions.
