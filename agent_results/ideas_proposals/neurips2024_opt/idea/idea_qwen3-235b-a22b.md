**Title:** Meta-Optimization for Scalable Hyperparameter Scaling Laws  

**Motivation:** Training large language models (LLMs) incurs massive computational and environmental costs due to trial-and-error hyperparameter tuning. Existing methods optimize hyperparameters independently for each model size, ignoring potential scaling patterns across architectures. Developing a framework to extrapolate optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes) from small-scale experiments could drastically reduce resource use while improving optimization efficiency.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a meta-optimization framework that learns hyperparameter scaling laws across model sizes and architectures. First, train a meta-model on diverse tasks to map model properties (depth, width, dataset) and compute budgets to optimal hyperparameters using historical training data. This meta-model encodes scaling laws via neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to capture continuous dependencies on model size. Second, integrate differentiable hyperparameter optimization: treat hyperparameters as learnable functions parameterized by the meta-model, enabling gradient-based updates during training. Validate by extrapolating hyperparameters from small models to LLMs, comparing against grid search and Bayesian optimization baselines. Expected outcomes include a 30â€“50% reduction in tuning compute costs and novel insights into hyperparameter dependencies. Impact spans faster LLM fine-tuning, democratized access to large-scale optimization, and reduced carbon footprints via resource-efficient training.
