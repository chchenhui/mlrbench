**1. Title:** **Optimization-Aware Scaling Laws for Efficient Hyperparameter Transfer in Large Model Training**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1. Background**
The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML), particularly the emergence of large-scale models like Large Language Models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023), has revolutionized numerous fields. However, training these colossal models presents significant challenges, primary among them being the immense computational cost and energy consumption (Patterson et al., 2021). Optimization algorithms are the bedrock upon which these models are trained, converting vast datasets and complex architectures into functional intelligence. Yet, the process of finding optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, momentum coefficients) for these optimizers remains a notoriously resource-intensive bottleneck.

The concept of "scaling laws" has provided valuable insights into how model performance predictably improves with increases in model size, dataset size, and compute (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Alabdulmohsin et al., 2022). These laws have guided efficient resource allocation for training ever-larger models. However, existing scaling laws predominantly focus MMD model performance as a function of model size ($N$), dataset size ($D$), and compute ($C$), often overlooking the crucial interplay between these factors and the specific dynamics of the chosen optimization algorithm and its hyperparameters ($H$). This oversight leads to a significant gap: hyperparameters meticulously tuned for smaller models often perform poorly when transferred to larger scales, necessitating expensive, iterative, and often ad-hoc tuning campaigns for each new target model size. This trial-and-error process consumes vast amounts of computational resources, hindering research progress and increasing the environmental footprint of AI.

Recent work has begun to address this gap, exploring scaling behaviors of specific hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size (Li et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2024) or developing sophisticated hyperparameter optimization (HPO) techniques aware of scaling costs (Fetterman et al., 2023). However, a comprehensive framework that systematically integrates the choice of optimizer and its core parameters into predictive scaling laws for efficient *transfer* across scales is still lacking. The sensitivity of large models to hyperparameter choices (Lit Review Challenge 1), coupled with the high cost of tuning (Challenge 2) and potential limitations of direct transfer (Challenge 4), highlights the urgent need for such a framework. Addressing how optimization algorithms themselves influence scaling (a key theme for OPT 2024) is paramount for unlocking truly compute-efficient training paradigms.

**2.2. Research Objectives**
This research aims to bridge the gap between architectural/data scaling laws and optimization dynamics by developing and validating **Optimization-Aware Scaling Laws (OASLs)**. These laws will explicitly model the relationship between optimal training hyperparameters, model scale, dataset characteristics, and the specific properties of the optimization algorithm employed.

The primary objectives are:

1.  **Derive Empirical OASLs:** Systematically investigate and quantify how optimal hyperparameters (specifically learning rate, batch size, momentum parameters, weight decay, and potentially parameters of learning rate schedules) scale as a function of model size (e.g., number of parameters, depth, width) for different families of commonly used optimizers (e.g., AdamW, SGD with Momentum, Adafactor). This involves large-scale, controlled experiments across a range of model sizes and architectures.
2.  **Develop a Formal Framework:** Formalize the observed empirical relationships into mathematical scaling laws. We hypothesize these laws may take forms like power laws or more complex functions that incorporate optimizer-specific constants or terms. For example, model the optimal learning rate $\eta^*$ as $\eta^*(N, O) \approx C_O N^{-\alpha_O}$, where $N$ is model size, $O$ represents the optimizer, and $C_O, \alpha_O$ are optimizer-dependent constants.
3.  **Create a Predictive Tool:** Implement the derived OASLs into a lightweight, practical framework or tool that can extrapolate from experiments on smaller models to predict (near-)optimal hyperparameter configurations for significantly larger target models, given the chosen optimizer. This tool aims to provide strong starting points, drastically reducing the search space for hyperparameter tuning.
4.  **Validate Extrapolation Performance:** Rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the OASL framework by applying its hyperparameter recommendations to train large-scale models (specifically LLMs) on downstream tasks (e.g., fine-tuning). Compare the training efficiency (convergence speed, final performance) and tuning cost (compute required to find hyperparameters) against standard baselines (e.g., naive transfer, common heuristics, limited HPO).

**2.3. Significance**
This research directly addresses the OPT 2024 focus on "Scaling up optimization" and the challenge of efficiently training large models. By integrating optimization dynamics into scaling laws, we anticipate the following significant contributions:

1.  **Reduced Computational Cost and Energy Consumption:** The primary impact will be a substantial reduction in the computational resources wasted on hyperparameter tuning for large models. By providing accurate initial hyperparameter estimates via extrapolation, OASLs can drastically shorten or even eliminate costly grid/random searches, saving significant compute time, cost, and energy, thereby contributing to more sustainable AI development.
2.  **Accelerated Model Development:** Faster and more reliable hyperparameter configuration will accelerate the training and deployment cycle for large models, enabling researchers and practitioners to iterate more quickly on model architectures and applications.
3.  **Improved Understanding of Optimization Dynamics at Scale:** The research will provide deeper theoretical and empirical insights into the complex interplay between model size, optimizer choice, and hyperparameter settings (addressing Lit Review Challenge 5). Understanding *why* hyperparameters scale differently for different optimizers can inform the design of future optimization algorithms better suited for large-scale regimes.
4.  **Democratization of Large Model Training:** By lowering the barrier (in terms of compute cost for tuning) to training large models effectively, this work can make state-of-the-art AI more accessible to research groups with limited computational resources.
5.  **Direct Contribution to Scaling Law Research:** This work extends the existing scaling law literature (Kaplan et al., 2023; Li et al., 2025) by introducing the crucial dimension of the optimizer, providing a more complete picture of predictable scaling in deep learning.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1. Research Design**
The research will follow a two-phase empirical and modeling approach:
*   **Phase 1: OASL Derivation:** Conduct systematic, controlled experiments training models of varying sizes using different optimizers and hyperparameter configurations to identify optimal settings and derive scaling relationships.
*   **Phase 2: Validation and Framework Development:** Formalize the derived laws, implement them in a predictive tool, and validate the tool's effectiveness by using its recommendations to train large models on downstream tasks, comparing against baselines.

**3.2. Data Collection (for Law Derivation)**
We will generate training trajectories and performance data, not collect pre-existing datasets in the traditional sense. The process involves:
*   **Model Architectures:** Primarily focus on Transformer-based architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017) commonly used for LLMs (e.g., GPT-style decoder-only, BERT-style encoder-only). We will systematically vary model size ($N$) by scaling depth and width across a wide range (e.g., from ~10 Million parameters up to ~1-10 Billion parameters, contingent on available compute). Multiple size points (e.g., 6-8 logarithmically spaced sizes) will be used for robust fitting of scaling laws.
*   **Datasets:** Utilize standard large-scale text corpora for pre-training tasks, such as subsets of The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) or C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), ensuring consistency across different model sizes. The total amount of data processed (tokens) will be controlled, potentially exploring data scaling effects alongside model scaling as in Hoffmann et al. (2022).
*   **Optimizers:** Select representative and widely used optimizers:
    *   AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) - Default choice for many LLMs.
    *   SGD with Momentum - A classical baseline with different dynamics.
    *   Adafactor (Shazeer & Stern, 2018) or other memory-efficient optimizers - Relevant for very large models.
*   **Hyperparameters Varied:** For each model size and optimizer combination, perform systematic sweeps (e.g., grid search over a logarithmically spaced range) to find the optimal values for key hyperparameters, primarily:
    *   Peak Learning Rate ($\eta_{peak}$)
    *   Batch Size ($B$)
    *   Momentum coefficients (e.g., $\beta_1, \beta_2$ for AdamW, momentum $\mu$ for SGD)
    *   Weight Decay ($\lambda$)
    *   Learning Rate Schedule parameters (e.g., warmup steps, decay strategy/rate like cosine decay).
*   **Definition of "Optimal":** Optimal hyperparameters will be defined based on achieving the lowest validation loss within a fixed computational budget (e.g., fixed number of training steps or FLOPs) or achieving a target validation loss most rapidly. This aligns with the practical goal of compute-efficient training. Multiple runs with different random seeds will be performed for each configuration to ensure statistical robustness.

**3.3. Algorithmic Steps and Mathematical Formulation (OASL Derivation)**

1.  **Data Generation:** For each optimizer $O$, model size $N_i$ (from the chosen range $N_1, ..., N_k$), train the model on the chosen dataset using a grid of hyperparameter settings $H_j$. Record the training/validation loss curves and compute usage (FLOPs/time).
2.  **Optimal Hyperparameter Identification:** For each $(O, N_i)$, identify the hyperparameter set $H^*_{O, N_i}$ that yields the best performance according to the chosen optimality criterion (e.g., lowest loss at step $T$).
3.  **Scaling Law Hypothesis:** Based on prior work (Kaplan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2025) and preliminary analysis, hypothesize functional forms for the scaling of each hyperparameter $h \in H^*$. A primary candidate is the power law:
    $$ h^*(N, O) \approx C_{h,O} N^{-\alpha_{h,O}} $$
    where $h^*$ is the optimal value of a specific hyperparameter (e.g., $\eta^*$, $B^*$), $N$ is the model size, and $C_{h,O}$ and $\alpha_{h,O}$ are constants specific to the hyperparameter $h$ and optimizer $O$. Other functional forms (e.g., incorporating logarithmic terms, or dependencies on optimizer-specific parameters like $\beta_1, \beta_2$) will also be explored. For batch size, the relationship might be different, potentially scaling with compute budget or having a more complex interaction with learning rate.
4.  **Parameter Fitting:** Fit the hypothesized scaling law models to the empirical data $(N_i, h^*_{O, N_i})$ collected in step 2. For power laws, this is typically done via linear regression on the log-log scale:
    $$ \log(h^*(N, O)) \approx \log(C_{h,O}) - \alpha_{h,O} \log(N) $$
    Goodness-of-fit metrics (e.g., $R^2$, Mean Squared Error on the log scale) will be used to evaluate the appropriateness of the model.
5.  **Optimizer-Specific Parameterization:** Analyze how the fitted parameters (e.g., $C_{h,O}, \alpha_{h,O}$) vary across different optimizers $O$. Investigate if these variations can be linked to theoretical properties of the optimizers (e.g., adaptivity, momentum usage). This step aims to understand *why* scaling differs between optimizers, potentially drawing inspiration from theoretical frameworks like SDE analysis (Xie et al., 2024).

**3.4. Experimental Design for Validation**

1.  **Target Models and Tasks:** Select target model sizes ($N_{target}$) significantly larger than the largest size ($N_k$) used for deriving the laws (e.g., extending to 7B, 13B, or larger parameter models if feasible). Choose representative downstream tasks, such as fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on benchmarks like GLUE (Wang et al., 2018), SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019), or specific instruction-following datasets.
2.  **Hyperparameter Recommendation:** Use the derived OASL functions $h^*(N, O)$ to predict the optimal hyperparameters $H^*_{O, N_{target}}$ for the target model sizes and chosen optimizers based on the fits obtained from smaller models.
3.  **Baseline Methods:** Compare the performance using OASL-recommended hyperparameters against:
    *   **Naive Transfer:** Using the optimal hyperparameters $H^*_{O, N_k}$ found for the largest model used in the derivation phase directly on the target model $N_{target}$.
    *   **Standard Heuristics:** Common practices for setting hyperparameters (e.g., default values in libraries, simple scaling rules like linear scaling of LR with batch size).
    *   **Limited HPO:** Performing a limited search (e.g., small grid or few random trials, Bayesian Optimization like CARBS (Fetterman et al., 2023) or LLM-based HPO (Zhang et al., 2023) with a restricted budget) directly on the target model $N_{target}$. This baseline helps quantify the cost savings of OASL.
    *   **(Optional) Full HPO:** If compute permits, perform extensive HPO on the target model to estimate the "true" optimal hyperparameters, serving as an oracle benchmark for OASL's prediction accuracy.
4.  **Training and Evaluation:** Train the target models using the hyperparameters from OASL and the baselines for a fixed computational budget or until convergence.

**3.5. Evaluation Metrics**

*   **OASL Fit Quality:**
    *   $R^2$ score for the regression fits of the scaling laws.
    *   Prediction error (e.g., Mean Absolute Percentage Error) of the laws on held-out model sizes within the derivation range.
*   **Validation Task Performance:**
    *   Final task performance (e.g., Accuracy, F1 score, Perplexity) achieved by models trained with OASL-recommended hyperparameters vs. baselines.
    *   Convergence Speed: Time (wall-clock or GPU hours) or number of training steps/tokens required to reach a target performance level. Plot Loss vs. Steps/Time.
*   **Tuning Efficiency:**
    *   **Extrapolation Cost:** The computational cost (FLOPs/time) to *derive* the OASL (amortized over potential uses) plus the negligible cost of *evaluating* the law for the target size.
    *   **Baseline Tuning Cost:** The computational cost (FLOPs/time) required by baseline HPO methods (Limited HPO) to find their respective hyperparameters on the target model.
    *   **Efficiency Gain:** Ratio or difference between Baseline Tuning Cost and Extrapolation Cost, demonstrating the practical savings offered by OASL. Compare the performance achieved by OASL recommendations directly vs. performance achieved by baselines *after* their tuning budget is spent.

In conclusion, this research proposes a systematic approach to developing and validating Optimization-Aware Scaling Laws. By bridging the gap between scaling laws and optimization theory, we aim to provide a powerful tool for making the training of large models significantly more efficient and predictable, directly impacting the cost, speed, and sustainability of future AI development.
