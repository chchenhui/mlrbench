**Benchmark Cards: Standardizing Context and Holistic Evaluation for ML Benchmarks**

### **2. Introduction**

#### **Background**  
Machine learning (ML) benchmarks and datasets are critical drivers of progress in AI research. However, reliance on oversimplified aggregate metrics, such as top-1 accuracy or F1 scores, has led to a culture of "leaderboard chasing," where models are optimized for narrow performance goals while neglecting other crucial aspects like fairness, robustness, efficiency, and context-specific suitability. This practice undermines real-world applicability, as models may fail under distribution shifts, exhibit biased behavior, or impose unsustainable computational costs. Moreover, benchmarks often lack standardized documentation, making it difficult to assess their scope, limitations, or alignment with deployment contexts. Existing solutions like Model Cards (Mitchell et al., 2018) address model transparency but leave a gap in benchmarking practices. The proposed **Benchmark Cards** framework aims to fill this gap by standardizing the documentation of evaluation contexts, dataset characteristics, and multi-dimensional metrics.

#### **Research Objectives**  
1. Develop a standardized **Benchmark Card** framework to document:  
   - The context and scope of a benchmark.  
   - Dataset characteristics, biases, and limitations.  
   - A suite of holistic evaluation metrics (e.g., subgroup fairness, robustness, efficiency).  
   - Use-case alignment and misuse scenarios.  
2. Validate the framework by populating cards for widely used benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet, GLUE) and evaluating their utility.  
3. Promote adoption through integration with ML repositories (e.g., HuggingFace, OpenML) and community-driven guidelines.  

#### **Significance**  
This work addresses critical gaps identified in the literature (e.g., HEM and HELM frameworks) by shifting benchmarking from single-score rankings to multi-faceted evaluation. By aligning with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, Benchmark Cards will improve reproducibility, reduce dataset misuse, and ensure models are evaluated in deployment-aligned contexts. This effort directly responds to the workshop’s call for improved data practices and benchmarking standards, with implications for ML research, education, and governance.

### **3. Methodology**  

#### **Research Design**  
**3.1. Meta-Analysis of Existing Benchmarks**  
- **Data Collection:** Catalog 50+ benchmarks from repositories (HuggingFace, OpenML, UCI) and recent literature.  
- **Gap Analysis:** Evaluate each benchmark’s documentation using criteria derived from HELM (Liang et al., 2022) and Model Cards (Mitchell et al., 2018), including:  
  - Presence of fairness/robustness metrics.  
  - Dataset provenance and bias reporting.  
  - Clarity on intended use cases.  
- **Quantification:** Use metrics like the **Documentation Completeness Score (DCS)**:  
  $$ \text{DCS} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{I}(\text{Criterion } i \text{ Addressed}), $$  
  where $N$ is the total criteria and $\mathbb{I}$ is an indicator function.  

**3.2. Benchmark Card Framework Development**  
- **Template Design:** Collaborate with ML repository administrators and ethicists to draft a structured template addressing:  
  1. **Context & Scope**: Deployment scenarios, target user groups.  
  2. **Dataset Characteristics**: Diversity, bias metrics (e.g., subgroup performance variance), and provenance.  
  3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Primary and secondary metrics (e.g., fairness, robustness, efficiency).  
  4. **Limitations**: Known dataset flaws, misuse risks.  
- **Metric Suite**: Incorporate:  
  - **Robustness**: Performance under distribution shifts (e.g., corrupted images), measured as relative drop:  
    $$ \text{Robustness Score} = \frac{\text{Performance}_{\text{shifted}}}{\text{Performance}_{\text{original}}}. $$  
  - **Fairness**: Disparity between subgroups using $\chi^2$ tests or equality of opportunity (Hardt et al., 2016).  
  - **Efficiency**: FLOPs, inference latency, energy consumption (Schwartz et al., 2020).  

**3.3. Experimental Validation**  
- **Benchmark Card Population**: Apply the framework to 10+ high-impact benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet, CIFAR-10, GLUE).  
- **User Studies**: Conduct surveys with 200+ ML practitioners to assess:  
  - **Usability**: Clarity and comprehensiveness of populated cards (5-point Likert scale).  
  - **Impact**: Changes in metric consideration during model selection (pre- vs. post-Benchmark Card usage).  
- **Repository Integration**: Partner with HuggingFace and OpenML to pilot card integration into dataset pages, tracking adoption rates and user feedback.  

**3.4. Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Primary Metrics**:  
  - Increase in DCS for benchmarks post-card implementation.  
  - Reduction in reported misuse cases (e.g., using ImageNet for medical diagnosis).  
- **Secondary Metrics**:  
  - User-reported confidence in model selection (survey-based).  
  - Community adoption rate (e.g., GitHub stars, citations).

### **4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

#### **Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Benchmark Card Framework**: A standardized, peer-reviewed template for holistic benchmark documentation.  
2. **Populated Cards**: Publicly available cards for 10+ benchmarks, hosted on HuggingFace and OpenML.  
3. **Validation Results**: Empirical evidence showing improved practitioner decision-making (e.g., 30% increase in multi-metric evaluation).  
4. **Community Guidelines**: Best practices for benchmark creation, endorsed by major ML repositories.  

#### **Impact**  
- **Research**: Enable context-aware model evaluation, reducing overfitting to narrow metrics. Foster reproducibility through FAIR-aligned documentation.  
- **Industry**: Mitigate deployment risks by aligning benchmarks with real-world requirements (e.g., fairness in hiring systems).  
- **Policy**: Inform regulatory frameworks for AI auditing (e.g., EU AI Act) by providing transparent benchmarking standards.  
- **Education**: Integrate Benchmark Cards into ML curricula to train next-generation researchers in responsible evaluation.

### **5. Conclusion**  
This proposal outlines a systematic approach to transforming ML benchmarking practices through the development and dissemination of Benchmark Cards. By bridging the gap between leaderboard optimization and real-world applicability, this framework will promote transparency, fairness, and robustness in AI development. The collaboration with ML repositories ensures immediate practical impact, while community engagement will drive long-term cultural change toward responsible benchmarking.
