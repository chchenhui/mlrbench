Title  
Benchmark Cards: Standardizing Context and Holistic Evaluation for Machine Learning Benchmarks  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Machine-learning research and applications critically depend on benchmark datasets and leaderboards for model development, comparison, and selection. Despite their ubiquity, current benchmarking practices exhibit several shortcomings: overemphasis on single aggregate metrics (e.g., top-1 accuracy), inconsistent or minimal documentation of dataset context, hidden biases within benchmark corpora, and a general lack of guidelines for holistic evaluation. This tunnel-vision on leaderboard position fosters “leaderboard chasing” rather than a comprehensive understanding of a model’s behavior under realistic conditions—robustness to distribution shifts, fairness across demographic subgroups, environmental efficiency, and domain-specific constraints often remain unexplored.  

Literature such as Model Cards for Model Reporting (Mitchell et al., 2018) introduced structured documentation for trained models, while HELM (Liang et al., 2022) and HEM (Li et al., 2024) propose multi-metric evaluation frameworks for language and federated learning models respectively. Yet, no work has standardized documentation for entire benchmarks themselves, leaving dataset curators and end-users without clear guidance on context, limitations, and recommended evaluation protocols.  

Research Objectives  
1. Design “Benchmark Cards,” a standardized documentation framework that accompanies any ML benchmark with metadata, usage context, and a prescriptive suite of holistic evaluation metrics.  
2. Develop an algorithmic toolkit to assist in populating Benchmark Cards from existing dataset repositories and README files, combining expert curation with automated extraction.  
3. Pilot the framework on three widely used benchmarks (e.g., GLUE for NLP, ImageNet for vision, SQuAD for question answering) and assess its effectiveness in improving model selection, reproducibility, and user understanding.  
4. Produce guidelines and open-source tooling that can be integrated into major ML data repositories (e.g., HuggingFace Datasets, OpenML).  

Significance  
By shifting the community’s focus from single-score leaderboards to context-aware, multi-dimensional evaluation, Benchmark Cards will promote more responsible model development, mitigate misuse of benchmarks, and improve transparency, reproducibility, and fairness in ML research.  

2. Literature Review  
Model Cards for Model Reporting (Mitchell et al., 2018)  
• Introduced structured documentation fields (intended use, performance across groups, ethical considerations).  
• Focused on trained models; did not address dataset-level context or benchmarking protocols.  

HELM: Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (Liang et al., 2022)  
• Evaluates language models across seven metrics (accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, efficiency) over 16 scenarios.  
• Emphasizes transparency but remains a manual framework without standardized templates for dataset curators.  

HEM: Use Case Sensitive Metrics for Federated Learning (Li et al., 2024)  
• Assigns importance weights to metrics (e.g., accuracy, convergence speed, fairness) based on use-case vectors.  
• Demonstrates improved algorithm selection but limited to federated settings and does not address dataset documentation.  

Gaps and Opportunities  
No current work offers:  
1. A template for documenting the intended scope, underlying biases, and holistic evaluation protocols of benchmarks themselves.  
2. An algorithmic toolkit for generating such documentation automatically or semi-automatically.  
3. An empirical evaluation of how standardized benchmark documentation affects model selection, reproducibility, and user satisfaction.  

3. Methodology  
Our methodology comprises four phases: (A) Template Design, (B) Algorithmic Toolkit Development, (C) Pilot Implementation, (D) Empirical Evaluation.  

Phase A: Benchmark Card Template Design  
Drawing from Model Cards, HELM, and HEM, we will define a JSON-schema template with the following required fields:  
  • Benchmark Overview: name, domain, version, source.  
  • Intended Use & Scope: target application contexts (e.g., medical imaging diagnosis), assumed data distributions.  
  • Dataset Characteristics: size, class distributions, data modalities, annotation processes.  
  • Known Biases & Limitations: subgroup disparities, sampling biases, underrepresented classes.  
  • Recommended Evaluation Suite: primary metric plus a prescriptive set $\{m_1,\ldots,m_k\}$ such as subgroup accuracy $m_{\text{sub}}$, robustness score $m_{\text{rob}}$, fairness index $m_{\text{fair}}$, latency/energy $m_{\text{eff}}$.  
  • Suggested Metric Definitions:  
 – Composite contextual score:  
  $$S = \sum_{i=1}^k w_i\,m_i,\quad \mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^k,\,\sum_i w_i=1,$$  
  where weights $w_i$ reflect stakeholder priorities.  
 – Fairness metric (max-min disparity):  
  $$\Delta_{\text{fair}} = \max_j m_j^{(\text{group})} - \min_j m_j^{(\text{group})}.$$  
 – Robustness to perturbations $\delta$:  
  $$m_{\text{rob}} = 1 - \frac{1}{|\Delta|}\sum_{\delta\in \Delta}\bigl|\mathrm{acc}(x)\!-\!\mathrm{acc}(x+\delta)\bigr|.$$  
  • Usage Guidelines & Potential Misuse Scenarios.  

Phase B: Algorithmic Toolkit  
We will build a Python library that semi-automatically populates Benchmark Cards by:  
1. Parsing dataset README and metadata via NLP pipelines.  
2. Extracting statistical summaries (e.g., class histograms, modality counts) with standard data-analysis tools.  
3. Running automated bias scans (e.g., disparity in label distributions across sensitive attributes) where attribute annotations exist.  
4. Suggesting additional evaluation metrics based on domain heuristics (e.g., word-error rate and robustness tests for speech).  
5. Generating a JSON-formatted Benchmark Card for manual expert review.  

Pseudocode:  
```
def generate_benchmark_card(dataset_path, schema):
    text = read_readme(dataset_path)
    meta = parse_metadata(text)              # NLP-based key-value extraction
    stats = compute_statistics(dataset_path) # histograms, missing values
    bias = run_bias_scanner(stats)           # disparity measures
    metrics = suggest_metrics(meta['domain'])
    weights = default_weights(metrics)
    card = assemble_json(schema, meta, stats, bias, metrics, weights)
    return card
```  
We will release this toolkit under an open-source license.  

Phase C: Pilot Implementation  
Select three widely used benchmarks:  
 • GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation)  
 • ImageNet (ILSVRC2012)  
 • SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)  

For each benchmark:  
1. Use our toolkit to generate initial Benchmark Cards.  
2. Convene a panel of domain experts (N=5 per benchmark) to review and refine the cards.  
3. Publish the finalized cards on a public repository and integrate with HuggingFace Datasets and/or OpenML.  

Phase D: Empirical Evaluation  
We will conduct a mixed-methods study to assess the impact of Benchmark Cards on (i) model selection accuracy, (ii) reproducibility, and (iii) user satisfaction.  

3.1 Model Selection Study  
Participants: 30 ML practitioners (PhD students, industry researchers).  
Design: Within-subjects. Each participant completes two tasks (A and B) in randomized order:  
  Task A (Control): Given only standard leaderboard tables + sparse README.  
  Task B (Experimental): Given leaderboard + Benchmark Card.  
Each task: choose the “best” model for a given application scenario (e.g., low-resource edge device requiring fairness guarantees), justify choice.  

Metrics:  
  • Selection accuracy: whether the chosen model meets scenario constraints (binary).  
  • Decision time $T$ (seconds).  
  • Cognitive load: NASA-TLX score.  
  • Justification quality: rated by blind reviewers on a 5-point rubric.  

Analysis: Paired t-tests on selection accuracy and $T$, Wilcoxon tests on TLX, rubric ratings.  

3.2 Reproducibility Study  
For each benchmark, ask participants to reproduce one published result (e.g., accuracy on GLUE’s SST-2). Compare:  
  • Control: traditional docs.  
  • Experiment: with Benchmark Card’s explicit evaluation protocol.  

Measure reproducibility error:  
$$E = |m_{\text{reproduced}} - m_{\text{reported}}|$$  
Hypothesis: $E_{\text{with\_cards}} < E_{\text{control}}$.  

3.3 Qualitative Feedback  
Post-study surveys and semi-structured interviews to assess perceived usefulness, clarity, and adoption barriers. Use Likert scales (1–7) and thematic coding.  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Deliverables  
• Benchmark Card JSON-schema and human-readable template.  
• Prototype Python toolkit for semi-automated card generation.  
• Completed Benchmark Cards for GLUE, ImageNet, and SQuAD, publicly hosted.  
• Empirical evidence demonstrating improved model selection accuracy, reduced reproducibility errors, and higher user satisfaction when using Benchmark Cards.  
• A set of community guidelines and best practices for dataset curators and repository maintainers.  

Impact  
• Culture Shift: Encourage the ML community to value context-aware, multi-metric evaluation over single-score optimization.  
• Improved Reproducibility: Clear, standardized protocols reduce ambiguity in experimental setups.  
• Enhanced Fairness & Robustness: Explicit reporting of biases and recommended tests promote more responsible model deployment.  
• Repository Integration: By collaborating with HuggingFace, OpenML, and the UCI ML Repository, facilitate broad adoption and sustainable maintenance of Benchmark Cards.  
• Educational Value: Provide students and newcomers with a structured approach to understanding dataset characteristics and benchmark limitations.  

Long-Term Vision  
We anticipate that Benchmark Cards will become a de facto standard for ML dataset repositories, akin to Model Cards for model reporting. In the longer term, the template and toolkit may be extended to dynamic benchmarks for foundation models, reinforcement learning environments, and federated learning settings, further fostering transparency and accountability in machine learning.
