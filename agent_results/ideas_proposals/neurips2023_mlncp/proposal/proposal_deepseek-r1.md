**Research Proposal: Co-Designing Physics-Informed Neural Architectures and Analog Hardware for Robust and Energy-Efficient Machine Learning**  

---

### 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Digital computing faces fundamental limitations in scalability, performance, and sustainability, exacerbated by the explosive compute demands of generative AI. Emerging non-traditional computing paradigms—such as analog, opto-analog, and neuromorphic hardware—offer energy-efficient alternatives but suffer from inherent challenges: noise, device mismatch, limited bit-depth, and dynamic operational variability. While prior work has explored noise-aware training and hardware-algorithm co-design, existing methods often treat hardware non-idealities as obstacles to overcome rather than features to exploit. This limits their ability to fully leverage the unique properties of analog systems, such as stochasticity and low-power computation.  

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal aims to develop a **hybrid training paradigm** that co-designs neural networks with analog hardware constraints by:  
1. Embedding **stochastic residual layers** to model hardware noise as probabilistic perturbations during forward and backward passes.  
2. Introducing a **physics-informed loss term** that regularizes weight updates to align with hardware-achievable dynamics (e.g., asymmetric activations, low bit-depth).  
3. Validating the approach via hardware-in-the-loop training and differentiable surrogate models of analog accelerators.  

**Significance**  
By co-designing models and hardware, this work will enable robust, energy-efficient training of compute-intensive architectures (e.g., energy-based models) on analog systems. It addresses critical gaps in sustainability and scalability while advancing the integration of machine learning with next-generation compute paradigms.

### 2. Methodology  

#### 2.1 Data Collection and Noise Modeling  
- **Datasets**: Standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and synthetic tasks to evaluate robustness under controlled noise conditions.  
- **Hardware Noise Profiles**: Characterize noise from analog accelerators (e.g., thermal noise, device mismatch) to build parametric models. For simulations, inject noise using:  
  $$ \eta \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu(t), \sigma^2(t)) $$  
  where $\mu(t)$ and $\sigma^2(t)$ are time-dependent parameters learned from hardware measurements.  

#### 2.2 Stochastic Residual Layers  
Each residual layer incorporates a **noise-aware perturbation module** during training:  
$$ \mathbf{h}_{l+1} = f_l(\mathbf{h}_l) + \alpha \cdot \mathbf{W}_l \mathbf{h}_l + \beta \cdot \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{h}_l; \theta_l) $$  
- $f_l$: Standard activation function.  
- $\mathcal{P}(\cdot; \theta_l)$: Noise generator parameterized by $\theta_l$, modeling hardware-specific perturbations.  
- $\alpha, \beta$: Learnable coefficients balancing signal and noise pathways.  

Gradients are computed through both deterministic and stochastic branches, enabling adaptive noise tolerance.  

#### 2.3 Physics-Informed Loss Function  
The total loss combines task-specific loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$ and hardware regularization $\mathcal{L}_{\text{phy}}$:  
$$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{phy}} $$  
- **Physics Regularizer**: Penalizes deviations from hardware constraints, e.g., limited bit-depth $b$:  
  $$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{phy}} = \sum_{l=1}^L \left( \text{ReLU}(|\mathbf{W}_l| - 2^{b}) \right)^2 $$  
- **Activation Alignment**: Enforces compatibility with asymmetric analog activations using a moment-matching term:  
  $$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{act}} = \mathbb{E}[(\phi(\mathbf{h}_l) - \phi_{\text{hardware}}(\mathbf{h}_l))^2] $$  

#### 2.4 Training Procedure  
1. **Forward Pass**: Compute outputs using stochastic residual layers and hardware noise profiles.  
2. **Backward Pass**: Differentiate through noise generators using reparameterization or surrogate gradients.  
3. **Hardware-in-the-Loop**: Periodically deploy models on physical analog hardware to refine noise parameters $\theta_l$.  
4. **Surrogate Models**: Train differentiable proxies of analog accelerators to simulate noise dynamics when hardware access is limited.  

#### 2.5 Experimental Design  
- **Baselines**: Compare against state-of-the-art methods:  
  - Variance-Aware Noisy Training [Wang et al., 2025]  
  - Noise-Aware Normalization [Tsai et al., 2020]  
  - Quantization-Aware Training [Zhou et al., 2020]  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Accuracy**: Top-1/Top-5 under varying noise levels.  
  - **Energy Efficiency**: Energy-per-inference (in pJ) measured via hardware profiling.  
  - **Robustness**: Accuracy drop under dynamic noise schedules.  
- **Hardware Setup**: Test on analog accelerators (e.g., IBM’s NorthPole, Mythic Analog Matrix Processor) and FPGA-based emulators.

### 3. Expected Outcomes  

1. **Noise-Robust Models**: Neural networks that achieve **<5% accuracy drop** under analog hardware noise, outperforming digital baselines at 4-bit precision.  
2. **Energy Efficiency**: **10–20× reduction** in energy consumption compared to GPU-trained models.  
3. **Generalization**: Improved performance on energy-based models (EBMs) by leveraging analog noise as free regularization.  

**Impact**  
- **Sustainability**: Enable large-scale AI training with lower carbon footprint.  
- **Edge AI**: Facilitate deployment of generative models on low-power devices (e.g., drones, IoT sensors).  
- **Community**: Open-source frameworks for hardware-algorithm co-design, accelerating adoption of analog accelerators.

### 4. Conclusion  
This proposal bridges the gap between machine learning and analog hardware by co-designing noise-aware architectures and physics-informed training paradigms. By treating hardware non-idealities as features rather than bugs, it paves the way for sustainable, scalable AI systems. Success will depend on cross-disciplinary collaboration—a key focus of the NeurIPS workshop on ML with New Compute Paradigms.
