# Physics-Informed Neural Architectures for Robust Training on Analog Hardware: A Noise-Adaptive Approach

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Digital computing is rapidly approaching fundamental physical limits, creating significant challenges for the continued advancement of machine learning, particularly for compute-intensive generative AI applications. As Moore's Law slows, traditional digital architectures face mounting obstacles in terms of energy efficiency, performance scaling, and overall sustainability. This comes at a time when AI compute demands are growing exponentially—training requirements for state-of-the-art models have been doubling approximately every 3.4 months, a trajectory that is clearly unsustainable with conventional hardware.

Analog and neuromorphic computing hardware offers a promising alternative path, with theoretical energy efficiency improvements of several orders of magnitude over digital counterparts. These non-traditional computing paradigms leverage physical principles to perform computations in the analog domain, eliminating the energy-intensive digital-to-analog conversions present in conventional systems. For example, analog accelerators can perform matrix multiplications—the dominant operation in neural networks—in constant time using physical properties like Ohm's law in resistive crossbar arrays.

However, the adoption of such hardware for mainstream machine learning has been limited by several fundamental challenges. Analog systems are inherently noisy, with computations susceptible to thermal noise, shot noise, and various other physical disturbances. They suffer from device mismatch during manufacturing, leading to non-uniform behavior across computational units. Additionally, these systems typically operate at reduced bit-depth compared to digital hardware, further complicating the deployment of neural networks that have been designed and optimized for high-precision computation.

Recent research has made promising strides in addressing these challenges. Approaches like Variance-Aware Noisy Training (Wang et al., 2025) and noise-aware batch normalization (Tsai et al., 2020) have demonstrated that neural networks can be made more robust to hardware noise through specialized training procedures. Knowledge distillation techniques have shown effectiveness in enhancing noise tolerance (Zhou et al., 2020), while physics-informed neural architectures have begun exploring how to incorporate hardware constraints directly into model design (White et al., 2023).

### Research Objectives

Despite these advances, a significant gap remains in developing a comprehensive framework that not only tolerates but actively exploits the unique characteristics of analog hardware. This research proposes to address this gap through the following objectives:

1. Develop a physics-informed neural architecture framework that explicitly incorporates analog hardware noise models into both the forward and backward passes during training.

2. Design novel "stochastic residual layers" that adaptively model hardware noise as probabilistic perturbations, allowing gradients to propagate through noise-aware pathways.

3. Formulate a hardware-aware loss function that regularizes weight updates to align with physically achievable dynamics on analog accelerators, including constraints like asymmetric activation functions and limited bit-depth.

4. Implement and evaluate a hardware-in-the-loop training methodology that alternates between software simulation and physical hardware to continuously refine the noise models.

5. Demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach across multiple model architectures, with a particular focus on energy-based models where noise can serve as a natural source of regularization.

### Significance

The successful realization of this research would have far-reaching implications for machine learning and computing:

First, it would establish a new paradigm for neural architecture design that treats hardware constraints not as limitations to be overcome but as features to be exploited. This shift in perspective could fundamentally change how we approach the development of machine learning models, particularly for specialized hardware.

Second, by enabling efficient training and inference on analog hardware, this research could dramatically reduce the energy footprint of machine learning, addressing one of the field's most pressing sustainability challenges. Current estimates suggest that training a single large language model can emit as much carbon as five cars over their lifetime; analog acceleration could potentially reduce this by orders of magnitude.

Third, the approach could democratize access to compute-intensive machine learning capabilities by enabling deployment on low-power edge devices. This would be particularly impactful for applications in resource-constrained environments, such as healthcare monitoring in developing regions or environmental sensing in remote areas.

Finally, the research could open new avenues for exploring model architectures that have been historically limited by computational resources, such as energy-based models, deep equilibrium models, and physically-informed neural networks, potentially leading to advances in model expressivity and efficiency.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Physics-Informed Noise Modeling

The first component of our methodology involves developing accurate physical models of noise and non-idealities in analog hardware. We will characterize these using both empirical measurements and theoretical analysis.

For a given analog hardware platform, we define a parameterized noise model $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ that captures the key sources of computational error:

$$\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \{f_{\text{thermal}}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t), f_{\text{quantization}}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_q), f_{\text{mismatch}}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_m), f_{\text{drift}}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_d), f_{\text{nonlinearity}}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_n)\}$$

where each function $f_i$ represents a specific noise source with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}_i$. For example, thermal noise might be modeled as a Gaussian distribution:

$$f_{\text{thermal}}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)(x) = x + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2(x, T))$$

where $\sigma^2(x, T)$ is the noise variance as a function of signal value $x$ and temperature $T$.

Similarly, quantization effects can be modeled as:

$$f_{\text{quantization}}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_q)(x) = \text{round}(x \cdot 2^b) / 2^b + \epsilon_q$$

where $b$ is the bit-depth parameter and $\epsilon_q$ represents additional quantization errors.

The complete noise model will incorporate all relevant noise sources and their interactions, based on the specific analog hardware platform being targeted.

### 2.2 Stochastic Residual Architecture

We propose a novel neural network architecture that incorporates stochastic residual layers (SRLs) specifically designed to adapt to and exploit hardware noise characteristics:

For a standard residual layer with function $F$ and input $x$, the output is typically:

$$y = x + F(x)$$

We modify this to create the Stochastic Residual Layer:

$$y = \alpha \odot x + (1-\alpha) \odot F(x) + \mathcal{N}_{\text{adapt}}(x, F(x), \boldsymbol{\theta})$$

where:
- $\alpha$ is a learnable parameter vector that controls the balance between the identity mapping and the residual function
- $\odot$ represents element-wise multiplication
- $\mathcal{N}_{\text{adapt}}$ is an adaptive noise function that models the expected hardware noise given the current inputs and network state

The adaptive noise function is implemented as:

$$\mathcal{N}_{\text{adapt}}(x, F(x), \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \sum_{i} w_i f_i(x, F(x), \boldsymbol{\theta}_i)$$

where $w_i$ are learnable weights that determine the contribution of each noise component, and $f_i$ are differentiable approximations of the hardware noise functions identified in section 2.1.

During backpropagation, we compute gradients through both the deterministic and stochastic paths using the reparameterization trick when necessary:

$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y} \left( \alpha + (1-\alpha) \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \mathcal{N}_{\text{adapt}}}{\partial x} \right)$$

This allows the network to learn how to effectively propagate signals through noisy computational pathways.

### 2.3 Physics-Informed Loss Function

We design a multi-component loss function that regularizes the model to operate effectively on analog hardware:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda_h \mathcal{L}_{\text{hardware}} + \lambda_r \mathcal{L}_{\text{robustness}}$$

The task-specific loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$ depends on the particular application (e.g., cross-entropy for classification).

The hardware-aware loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{hardware}}$ penalizes model parameters and activations that would be difficult to realize accurately on the target hardware:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{hardware}} = \beta_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{bit-depth}} + \beta_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{range}} + \beta_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{sparsity}}$$

where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{bit-depth}}$ penalizes weights requiring high precision: $\sum_i \text{complexity}(w_i)$
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{range}}$ ensures activations remain within the analog hardware's operating range
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{sparsity}}$ encourages activation sparsity to reduce energy consumption

The robustness loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{robustness}}$ promotes consistent predictions under varying noise conditions:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{robustness}} = \mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\theta})} [D(f(x), f(x+z))]$$

where $D$ is a suitable distance metric between clean and noisy predictions, and $z$ represents noise samples from our hardware noise model.

### 2.4 Hardware-in-the-Loop Training

We propose an alternating training procedure that combines simulation with actual hardware execution:

1. **Initialization Phase**: Train the model in simulation using the differentiable noise models described in Section 2.1.

2. **Hardware Calibration Phase**:
   - Deploy the current model to the target analog hardware
   - Execute forward passes on a calibration dataset
   - Measure the actual hardware outputs and compare with simulated predictions
   - Update the noise model parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ to minimize the discrepancy: 
     $$\boldsymbol{\theta}^* = \arg\min_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \sum_i ||y_{\text{hw},i} - y_{\text{sim},i}(\boldsymbol{\theta})||^2$$

3. **Simulation Phase**:
   - Continue training using the updated noise models
   - Optimize model parameters using the physics-informed loss function
   - Periodically return to the Hardware Calibration Phase

4. **Final Hardware Fine-tuning**:
   - In the final stage, perform limited fine-tuning directly on the hardware
   - Use specialized low-precision optimization techniques adapted for the analog platform

This alternating approach ensures that our models maintain consistency between simulated training and actual hardware performance.
