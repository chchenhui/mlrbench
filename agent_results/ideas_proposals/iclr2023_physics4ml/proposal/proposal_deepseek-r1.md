**Research Proposal: Symplectic Neural Networks: Enforcing Geometric Conservation Laws via Physics-Informed Architectures**

---

### 1. **Introduction**

**Background**  
The integration of physics principles into machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative paradigm, particularly in scientific computing and dynamical systems modeling. Physical systems inherently obey geometric conservation laws—such as energy preservation, symplecticity in Hamiltonian mechanics, and momentum conservation—yet conventional deep learning architectures often fail to enforce these invariants. This results in unphysical predictions in scientific applications (e.g., molecular dynamics, fluid simulations) and unstable training dynamics in classical tasks like video prediction. Recent advances in physics-inspired ML, such as Hamiltonian neural networks (HNNs) and symplectic integrators, have demonstrated the value of embedding physical priors. However, these methods often focus on specific system classes (e.g., separable Hamiltonians) or require ad hoc constraints, limiting their generality.

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal aims to develop **symplectic neural networks** (SympNNs), a novel architecture class that inherently preserves geometric invariants by structuring layers as symplectic maps. Specific objectives include:  
1. Designing scalable, parameter-efficient layers that enforce symplecticity via Hamiltonian splitting and constrained optimization.  
2. Validating SympNNs on physics-based tasks (e.g., molecular dynamics, fluid simulations) and classical ML problems (e.g., video prediction, graph representation learning).  
3. Analyzing the impact of geometric constraints on training stability, generalization, and data efficiency.  

**Significance**  
By unifying geometric physics with ML, SympNNs will address critical limitations in both scientific and industrial applications:  
- **Robustness**: Enforcing conservation laws ensures physically plausible predictions.  
- **Data Efficiency**: Inductive biases reduce reliance on large datasets.  
- **Interpretability**: Symplectic structures align with known physics, enhancing model trustworthiness.  
This work bridges the gap between theoretical physics and ML, offering a framework for building trustworthy models in domains where conservation laws are paramount.

### 2. **Methodology**

#### **Research Design**  
The methodology integrates theoretical insights from Hamiltonian mechanics with modern deep learning techniques. The core innovation lies in structuring neural network layers as symplectic transformations, which preserve phase-space volume and energy.

**Data Collection**  
- **Physics Datasets**:  
  - Molecular dynamics trajectories (e.g., MD17, ANI-1).  
  - Fluid flow simulations (e.g., Navier-Stokes solutions, vortex shedding data).  
  - Astrophysical N-body simulations.  
- **Classical ML Datasets**:  
  - Video prediction (e.g., Moving MNIST, KTH Action).  
  - Time-series forecasting (e.g., electricity consumption, traffic flow).  

**Algorithmic Framework**  
1. **Symplectic Layer Design**:  
   Each layer implements a symplectic map $f: (q, p) \mapsto (Q, P)$, where $(q, p)$ are generalized coordinates and momenta. Using Hamiltonian splitting, transformations decompose into kinetic ($K$) and potential ($V$) components:  
   $$
   f = \exp(h \cdot L_{K}) \circ \exp(h \cdot L_{V}),
   $$  
   where $h$ is the step size, and $L_{K}, L_{V}$ are Lie derivatives derived from the Hamiltonian. The network parameters are constrained to satisfy the symplectic condition:  
   $$
   J = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & I \\ -I & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \nabla f^T J \nabla f = J.
   $$  

2. **Hamiltonian Graph Neural Networks**:  
   For graph-based tasks (e.g., particle systems), message-passing layers model interactions via Hamilton’s equations:  
   $$
   \dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}, \quad \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i},
   $$  
   where $H$ is learned as a neural network with weight constraints ensuring symplecticity.  

3. **Training Strategy**:  
   - **Loss Function**: Combines task-specific loss (e.g., mean squared error) with a symplectic regularization term:  
     $$
     \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda \left\| \nabla f^T J \nabla f - J \right\|_F^2.
     $$  
   - **Optimization**: Use constrained optimizers (e.g., Riemannian SGD) to maintain layer symplecticity.  

**Experimental Validation**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against standard neural networks, HNNs, and symplectic integrators.  
- **Tasks**:  
  1. **Physics Applications**:  
     - Predict molecular forces and energies (evaluation: force MAE, energy drift).  
     - Simulate turbulent fluid flows (evaluation: vorticity error, long-term stability).  
  2. **Classical ML Applications**:  
     - Video frame prediction (evaluation: SSIM, MSE).  
     - Graph property prediction (evaluation: ROC-AUC, conservation error).  
- **Metrics**:  
  - Conservation error ($\Delta E = \|E(t) - E(0)\|$).  
  - Prediction accuracy (MSE, MAE).  
  - Training stability (loss convergence rate, gradient norms).
