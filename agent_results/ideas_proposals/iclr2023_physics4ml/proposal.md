Title  
Geometric Conservation Laws in Neural Networks via Symplectic Architectures  

Introduction  
Background  
Standard deep learning models excel at fitting complex data but often ignore fundamental physical principles such as conservation of energy, momentum, or phase-space volume. In scientific applications—molecular dynamics, fluid simulations, celestial mechanics—violating these invariants leads to unphysical behavior and long-term instability. In classical machine learning tasks (e.g., video prediction, dynamical system forecasting), models that fail to respect underlying geometric constraints can produce drift and degrade generalization. Recent work on Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs), symplectic integrators, and equivariant architectures has shown promise in embedding physical laws as inductive biases, yet a unifying framework that guarantees symplecticity and energy preservation across diverse domains remains lacking.  

Research Objectives  
1. Design a family of neural network architectures whose layers are provably symplectic maps, thereby conserving the canonical two-form and phase-space volume by construction.  
2. Extend these architectures to graph-structured data by embedding Hamiltonian splitting methods into message-passing layers, enabling energy-preserving updates in multi-particle and molecular systems.  
3. Develop training protocols that leverage symplectic constraints to improve sample efficiency, training stability, and long-term prediction accuracy.  
4. Evaluate the proposed symplectic networks on benchmarks spanning physics simulations (pendulum, n-body, fluid PDEs) and classical tasks (video-frame forecasting, generative modeling of dynamical processes).  

Significance  
By enforcing geometric conservation laws at the architectural level, we expect:  
- Robustness to long-term integration without drift in energy or volume.  
- Improved generalization across unseen initial conditions and parameter regimes.  
- Reduced data requirements through strong inductive biases.  
- A bridge between physical-science modeling and mainstream ML, offering trustworthy models for safety-critical applications.  

Methodology  
Overview  
Our approach builds on the theory of symplectic integrators and Hamiltonian splitting. We parameterize a Hamiltonian function $H(q,p)$ via neural networks and implement discrete-time layers that exactly preserve the symplectic form. We then generalize to graphs by treating nodes as particles and edges as interactions in the Hamiltonian. The full pipeline comprises data generation, architecture specification, training, and evaluation.  

1. Data Collection  
We will use a combination of synthetic and real datasets:  
- Canonical Hamiltonian systems: simple pendulum, double pendulum, spring–mass systems, Kepler n-body problems.  
- Partial differential equations (PDEs) cast as Hamiltonian systems: nonlinear Schrödinger equation, shallow-water equations, Euler equations for incompressible flow.  
- Molecular dynamics trajectories from standard benchmarks (e.g., MD17 dataset).  
- Classical ML tasks: video-frame prediction datasets (e.g., Moving MNIST, human action sequences), dynamical systems benchmarks (e.g., Lorenz attractor).  

2. Symplectic Neural Network Architecture  
2.1 Hamiltonian Parameterization  
We define trainable functions  
$$T(p; \theta_T)\,,\quad V(q; \theta_V)$$  
representing kinetic and potential energy, respectively. The total Hamiltonian is  
$$H(q,p;\theta) = T(p;\theta_T) + V(q;\theta_V)\,. $$  

2.2 Symplectic Integrator Layers  
We adopt a second-order Strang (leapfrog) splitting scheme. Given a time step $\Delta t$, each layer updates $(q_n,p_n)\to(q_{n+1},p_{n+1})$ as follows:  

$$
\begin{aligned}
p_{n+\tfrac12} &= p_n - \tfrac{\Delta t}{2}\,\nabla_q V(q_n;\theta_V)\,,\\
q_{n+1} &= q_n + \Delta t\,\nabla_p T(p_{n+\tfrac12};\theta_T)\,,\\
p_{n+1} &= p_{n+\tfrac12} - \tfrac{\Delta t}{2}\,\nabla_q V(q_{n+1};\theta_V)\,.
\end{aligned}
$$

By construction, this map is symplectic and preserves a modified energy up to local error $O(\Delta t^3)$. We stack $L$ such layers to form a deep network that maps an initial condition to a future state after $L$ time steps.  

2.3 Graph-Structured Symplectic Layers  
For a system of $N$ particles, let $q=(q_1,\dots,q_N)$, $p=(p_1,\dots,p_N)$ and let $\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$ denote the interaction graph. We parameterize the Hamiltonian as  
$$H(q,p) = \sum_{i\in\mathcal{V}} T_i(p_i) + \sum_{(i,j)\in\mathcal{E}} V_{ij}(q_i,q_j)\,. $$  
Here $V_{ij}$ is a neural network that models pairwise potential. The symplectic update uses the same leapfrog steps, with  
$$\nabla_q V(q) = \bigl[\sum_{j:(i,j)\in\mathcal{E}} \nabla_{q_i}V_{ij}(q_i,q_j)\bigr]_{i=1}^N\,. $$  
Message passing: in each half-step we compute edge messages $m_{ij}= \nabla_{q_i}V_{ij}(q_i,q_j)$, aggregate at nodes, and update $p$. The $q$-update uses gradients of kinetic terms per particle.  

3. Training Procedures  
3.1 Loss Functions  
We minimize a trajectory reconstruction loss over $M$ time steps:  
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{traj}} = \frac1M\sum_{n=1}^M \|q_n^{\text{pred}}-q_n^{\text{true}}\|^2 + \|p_n^{\text{pred}}-p_n^{\text{true}}\|^2\,. $$  
Optionally, we add an energy-error regularizer:  
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{energy}} = \frac1M\sum_{n=1}^M \bigl(H(q_n^{\text{pred}},p_n^{\text{pred}})-H(q_0,p_0)\bigr)^2\,. $$  
Because the architecture is symplectic, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{energy}}$ remains small without explicit enforcement; it serves principally as a diagnostic.  

3.2 Optimization  
- Optimizer: Adam with learning rate scheduling.  
- Mini-batching: for graph models, sample subgraphs or random initial conditions.  
- Regularization: weight decay, gradient clipping to maintain numerical stability.  

3.3 Baselines and Ablations  
- Hamiltonian Neural Networks (Greydanus et al., 2019).  
- Symplectic ODE-Nets (Zhong et al., 2022).  
- Non-symplectic MLP integrator.  
Ablations: remove splitting (use single-step Euler), omit graph structure, vary network depth.  

4. Experimental Design & Evaluation Metrics

In summary, this research will unify geometric physics principles with deep learning by constructing symplectic neural networks that guarantee conservation laws at the architectural level. Through rigorous methodology and comprehensive evaluation, we aim to demonstrate that these physics-inspired inductive biases yield more robust, generalizable, and data-efficient models for both scientific simulation and classical machine learning tasks.
