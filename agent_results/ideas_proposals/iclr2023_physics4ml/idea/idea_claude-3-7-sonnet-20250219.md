# Physics-Informed Diffusion Models for Improved Generative Capabilities

## Motivation
Current diffusion models achieve impressive results in generative tasks but often lack physical consistency, producing visually appealing but physically implausible outputs. This limits their application in domains requiring physical realism such as scientific simulations, virtual environments, and digital twins. By incorporating fundamental physical laws directly into the diffusion process, we can create generative models that respect conservation principles, symmetries, and causal relationships inherent in natural processes.

## Main Idea
We propose Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (PIDMs) that modify the standard score-based SDE framework by introducing physics-based regularization terms during both training and sampling. Our approach embeds physical constraints as differential operators in the score network architecture, ensuring generated samples follow trajectories consistent with physical laws. Specifically, we implement: (1) conservation-preserving noise schedules that maintain physical invariants throughout the diffusion process; (2) Hamiltonian-based correction steps during sampling that enforce energy conservation; and (3) symmetry-equivariant denoising networks that respect fundamental invariances like rotation, translation, and scale. Unlike traditional physics-based constraints that often sacrifice generative diversity, our method maintains the expressiveness of diffusion models while significantly improving physical plausibility. Preliminary experiments show PIDMs outperform standard diffusion models in tasks requiring physical coherence while maintaining comparable sample quality on standard benchmarks.
