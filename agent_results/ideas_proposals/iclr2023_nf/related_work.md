1. **Title**: A Physics-Informed Meta-Learning Framework for the Continuous Solution of Parametric PDEs on Arbitrary Geometries (arXiv:2504.02459)
   - **Authors**: Reza Najian Asl, Yusuke Yamazaki, Kianoosh Taghikhani, Mayu Muramatsu, Markus Apel, Shahed Rezaei
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces implicit Finite Operator Learning (iFOL), a physics-informed encoder-decoder network designed to solve parametric PDEs on arbitrary geometries. The framework employs an implicit neural field network conditioned on a latent code, with instance-specific codes derived through a second-order meta-learning technique. The approach emphasizes a physics-informed loss function expressed in an energy or weighted residual form, evaluated using discrete residuals from standard numerical PDE methods. Key features include the elimination of the traditional encode-process-decode pipeline, provision of solution-to-parameter gradients without additional loss terms, effective capture of sharp discontinuities, and applicability to arbitrary geometries and spatial sampling. The method demonstrates promising performance across stationary and transient PDEs in computational mechanics.

2. **Title**: Meta-learning of Physics-informed Neural Networks for Efficiently Solving Newly Given PDEs (arXiv:2310.13270)
   - **Authors**: Tomoharu Iwata, Yusuke Tanaka, Naonori Ueda
   - **Summary**: This work proposes a meta-learning approach for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to efficiently solve new PDE problems. The method encodes PDE problems into a representation using neural networks, where governing equations are represented by coefficients of a polynomial function of partial derivatives, and boundary conditions are represented by point-condition pairs. This problem representation serves as input to a neural network that predicts solutions, enabling efficient problem-specific solutions without updating model parameters. Training involves minimizing the expected error when adapted to a PDE problem based on the PINN framework, allowing error evaluation even when solutions are unknown. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in predicting solutions of PDE problems.

   - **Authors**: Nils Wandel, Stefan Schulz, Reinhard Klein
   - **Summary**: Metamizer introduces a neural optimizer that iteratively solves various physical systems with high accuracy by minimizing a physics-based loss function.

Notably, the model generalizes to PDEs not covered during training, such as the Poisson, wave, and Burgers equations, suggesting its potential impact on future numerical solvers for fast and accurate neural physics simulations without retraining.

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Optimization Difficulties in PINNs**: Physics-informed neural networks often face challenges in optimization, particularly when solving PDEs with distinct properties. The sensitivity of PINNs to activation functions can lead to convergence issues and suboptimal solutions. Adaptive activation functions have been proposed to address this, but selecting and tuning these functions remains a complex task.

2. **Generalization Across Geometries**: Traditional PINNs are typically trained for specific geometries, requiring retraining for each new geometry, which is computationally expensive. Developing models that can generalize across multiple irregular geometries without retraining is a significant challenge. Approaches like Physics-informed PointNet (PIPN) aim to address this by leveraging geometric feature extraction, but further research is needed to enhance scalability and efficiency.

3. **Capturing Multi-Scale Phenomena**: Accurately capturing multi-scale features in PDE solutions is challenging for neural field models. Adaptive activation functions and meta-learning techniques have been explored to improve the resolution of fine-scale features, but achieving consistent accuracy across different scales remains an open problem.

4. **Efficient Training and Inference**: Training neural field models for PDEs can be computationally intensive, especially when dealing with high-dimensional or dynamic systems. Developing efficient training algorithms and architectures that reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy is crucial for practical applications.
