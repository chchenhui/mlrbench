**Title:** **Self-Supervised Feature Learning from Neural Fields for Downstream Tasks**  

**Motivation:** Neural fields excel at representing complex, high-dimensional data (e.g., 3D scenes, medical images, climate signals) but lack explicit mechanisms to extract high-level semantic features for downstream tasks like classification, anomaly detection, or predictive modeling. While their interpolation capabilities are well-established, leveraging neural fields as a foundation for interpretable or task-driven analysis remains underexplored, limiting their utility in domains requiring actionable insights beyond reconstruction.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a self-supervised framework to learn disentangled, task-agnostic features directly from neural fields. Our architecture integrates a coordinate-based neural field (e.g., SIREN or Fourier Features) with a hypernetwork that generates lightweight, spatially aware feature embeddings. These embeddings are trained via contrastive learning, using spatial transformations (e.g., rotations, translations) as positive pairs and unrelated regions as negatives. This encourages the model to capture structural invariants and semantic hierarchies inherent in the data. For example, in medical imaging, the features could highlight anatomical relationships; in climate science, they might encode spatiotemporal weather patterns. The resulting features are then fine-tuned for downstream tasks (e.g., tumor detection in MRI scans or extreme weather prediction). We evaluate performance on diverse modalities (images, 3D shapes, climate data) and benchmark against traditional CNNs and pure neural field baselines. Success would enable efficient, interpretable analysis of neural fields across domains, addressing a critical gap in their current application.
