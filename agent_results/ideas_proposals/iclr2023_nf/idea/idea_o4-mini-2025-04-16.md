Title: Meta-Conditioned Implicit Neural Fields for Rapid Spatio-Temporal Weather Simulation  

Motivation: High-resolution weather forecasting is computationally intensive and often tailored to specific regions. Coordinate-based neural fields promise continuous spatio-temporal modeling but struggle to generalize across different climate regimes without costly retraining. A meta-learning approach can enable fast adaptation to new locales with minimal data.  

Main Idea: We propose a meta-learning framework that trains an implicit neural field fθ(x,y,t; c) → {temperature, pressure, wind} mapping spatial (x,y) and temporal t coordinates, conditioned on a context vector c encoding regional climate statistics. Coordinates are embedded via Fourier features; training minimizes supervised reconstruction loss on historical reanalysis data plus physics-informed losses enforcing mass and energy conservation (e.g., Navier–Stokes residuals). During meta-training over diverse climate zones, fθ learns initialization parameters that, when coupled with a small context set from an unseen region, can be fine-tuned in seconds to produce high-fidelity, resolution-agnostic forecasts. We will evaluate on global reanalysis benchmarks, measuring forecast accuracy, adaptation time, and computational savings against full retraining. This method aims to democratize localized weather prediction and scalable climate scenario analysis.
