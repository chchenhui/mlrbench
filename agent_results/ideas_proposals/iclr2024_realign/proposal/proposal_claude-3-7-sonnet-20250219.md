# Cross-Domain Representational Alignment via Invariant Feature Extraction (RIFE)

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Modern artificial intelligence systems increasingly form complex representations of the world, analogous to those created by biological neural systems. These representations serve as the foundation for reasoning, decision-making, and communication. A fundamental question in the study of intelligence, both artificial and natural, is whether different systems develop similar representations when exposed to similar tasks or environments. The concept of representational alignment—measuring and quantifying the similarity between representations across different systems—has emerged as a crucial area of research at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science.

Despite significant progress in representational alignment research, current methodologies face substantial limitations when comparing representations across fundamentally different domains. Traditional alignment metrics such as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and their variants, often struggle when applied to representations from disparate sources such as fMRI data and deep neural network activations. These metrics generally assume commensurate dimensionality, comparable scaling properties, or similar data structures—assumptions that rarely hold across biological and artificial systems.

The challenge is particularly acute when attempting to align representations across different modalities (e.g., visual cortex activity vs. CNN activations), architectures (e.g., recurrent neural networks vs. transformers), or even different layers within the same architecture. This misalignment limits our ability to understand shared computational principles and hinders the development of AI systems that can effectively communicate or cooperate with biological intelligence.

### Research Objectives

This research proposal introduces a novel framework called Representational Alignment via Invariant Feature Extraction (RIFE), designed to overcome the limitations of current alignment metrics. Our specific objectives are:

1. To develop a domain-agnostic framework for measuring representational alignment between arbitrary neural systems (both biological and artificial) without requiring direct correspondence between their architectures or modalities.

2. To leverage recent advances in domain adaptation, particularly contrastive-adversarial techniques, to learn invariant feature spaces where representations from different systems can be directly compared.

3. To validate the effectiveness of our approach by aligning representations across diverse pairs of systems, including primate visual cortex vs. computer vision models and human language processing vs. large language models.

4. To investigate whether alignment scores derived from our framework predict behavioral congruence between systems (e.g., similar error patterns, comparable generalization capabilities).

5. To provide insights into which representational features are conserved across different forms of intelligence and how this conservation relates to functional capabilities.

### Significance

The proposed research has significant implications for multiple fields:

In **neuroscience**, our framework will provide a more principled method for comparing neural representations across species, brain regions, or individuals, potentially revealing universal computational principles that transcend specific implementations.

In **artificial intelligence**, understanding which representational properties align with biological systems could guide the development of more human-like AI. This has applications in interpretable AI, AI safety, and human-AI collaboration.

In **cognitive science**, our approach will help bridge the gap between computational models of cognition and empirical observations, facilitating more precise theories of how representation enables intelligent behavior.

From a **practical perspective**, the ability to measure alignment across diverse systems could enable new techniques for knowledge transfer between models, more effective brain-computer interfaces, and better evaluation metrics for biologically-inspired AI architectures.

By addressing the fundamental question of when and why intelligent systems develop aligned representations, this research contributes to the broader goal of developing a unifying theory of intelligence that spans both biological and artificial systems.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed framework, Representational Alignment via Invariant Feature Extraction (RIFE), employs a two-stage approach that combines adversarial domain adaptation with contrastive learning to create a domain-invariant feature space. In this space, representational alignment between different neural systems can be measured using standard similarity metrics.

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

Let $X_A$ and $X_B$ represent the activation patterns (representations) from two neural systems A and B, respectively. These could be, for example, fMRI voxel activations from a human brain region and neuron activations from a layer in a deep neural network. We define:

- $X_A = \{x_A^1, x_A^2, ..., x_A^n\}$ where $x_A^i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_A}$ are representation vectors from system A
- $X_B = \{x_B^1, x_B^2, ..., x_B^m\}$ where $x_B^j \in \mathbb{R}^{d_B}$ are representation vectors from system B

Note that $d_A$ and $d_B$ may differ, and the representations might have completely different scales and structures. The stimulus sets for systems A and B are denoted by $S_A$ and $S_B$, respectively, where each stimulus corresponds to a representation vector.

Our goal is to learn transformation functions $f_A: \mathbb{R}^{d_A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $f_B: \mathbb{R}^{d_B} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d}$ that map the representations from each system into a shared feature space of dimension $d$, where alignment can be meaningfully measured.

### 2.2 Adversarial Alignment Stage

The first stage of RIFE aims to align the global distributions of representations from systems A and B using adversarial training. We employ a domain adversarial neural network architecture consisting of:

1. **Feature extractors** $f_A$ and $f_B$ (implemented as neural networks) that map representations from each system to the shared space.
2. A **domain discriminator** $D$ that attempts to classify whether a given feature vector in the shared space originated from system A or system B.

The adversarial training objective is:

$$\min_{f_A, f_B} \max_D \mathcal{L}_{adv}(f_A, f_B, D)$$

where:

$$\mathcal{L}_{adv} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\log D(f_A(x_A^i)) + \frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^{m}\log (1 - D(f_B(x_B^j)))$$

This adversarial loss encourages the feature extractors to map the representations from both systems to a common distribution in the shared space, making them indistinguishable to the discriminator.

### 2.3 Contrastive Refinement Stage

While the adversarial stage aligns the global distributions, it does not ensure that functionally equivalent representations are mapped to the same regions of the shared space. The contrastive refinement stage addresses this by leveraging the assumption that representations evoked by the same (or similar) stimuli should be close in the shared space.

For this stage, we need a set of paired stimuli $S_{AB} = \{(s_A^k, s_B^k)\}_{k=1}^p$ where $s_A^k \in S_A$ and $s_B^k \in S_B$ are semantically equivalent stimuli presented to systems A and B, respectively. Let $x_A^k$ and $x_B^k$ be the corresponding representations.

We employ a contrastive loss function:

$$\mathcal{L}_{cont} = \sum_{k=1}^{p} \Big[ -\log \frac{\exp(-d(f_A(x_A^k), f_B(x_B^k))/\tau)}{\sum_{l=1}^{p} \exp(-d(f_A(x_A^k), f_B(x_B^l))/\tau)} \Big]$$

where $d(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a distance function (e.g., Euclidean distance) in the shared space, and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.

To mitigate the issue of false negatives (when semantically similar stimuli are treated as negatives), we incorporate a clustering-based approach to identify potential false negatives. Specifically, we:

1. Apply k-means clustering to the projected representations in the shared space.
2. For each anchor, exclude from the negative set any representations that belong to the same cluster.

The refined contrastive loss becomes:

$$\mathcal{L}_{cont}^{refined} = \sum_{k=1}^{p} \Big[ -\log \frac{\exp(-d(f_A(x_A^k), f_B(x_B^k))/\tau)}{\sum_{l \in \mathcal{N}_k} \exp(-d(f_A(x_A^k), f_B(x_B^l))/\tau)} \Big]$$

where $\mathcal{N}_k$ is the set of indices for samples that do not belong to the same cluster as the anchor $x_A^k$.

### 2.4 Combined Training Objective

The overall training objective for RIFE combines the adversarial and contrastive losses:

$$\mathcal{L}_{total} = \lambda_{adv} \mathcal{L}_{adv} + \lambda_{cont} \mathcal{L}_{cont}^{refined}$$

where $\lambda_{adv}$ and $\lambda_{cont}$ are hyperparameters controlling the relative importance of each loss term.

### 2.5 Measuring Alignment in the Shared Space

Once the feature extractors $f_A$ and $f_B$ are trained, we can project new representations from systems A and B into the shared space and measure their alignment using standard similarity metrics. We propose several complementary measures:

1. **Representational Similarity Correlation:** For two sets of stimuli $S_A' \subset S_A$ and $S_B' \subset S_B$, we compute the pairwise distance matrices $D_A$ and $D_B$ in the shared space:

   $$D_A(i,j) = d(f_A(x_A^i), f_A(x_A^j))$$
   $$D_B(i,j) = d(f_B(x_B^i), f_B(x_B^j))$$

   The alignment is measured as the correlation between the flattened upper triangular portions of $D_A$ and $D_B$.

2. **Nearest Neighbor Accuracy:** For paired stimuli $(s_A^k, s_B^k)$, we compute the fraction of cases where $f_B(x_B^k)$ is the nearest neighbor of $f_A(x_A^k)$ in the shared space (and vice versa).

3. **Centroid Distance:** We compute the average distance between the centroids of clustered representations in the shared space, where clusters correspond to semantically equivalent stimuli categories.

### 2.6 Experimental Design

To validate our framework, we will conduct experiments across several pairs of neural systems:

#### Experiment 1: Visual Representations (Primate Visual Cortex vs. Computer Vision Models)
- **Biological System:** fMRI recordings from macaque IT cortex during visual object recognition.
- **Artificial Systems:** (a) Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet-50), (b) Vision Transformers (ViT), (c) Self-supervised models (CLIP, DINO).
- **Stimuli:** A diverse set of natural images from ImageNet and objects from COCO dataset.
- **Analysis:** Compare RIFE alignment scores with behavioral congruence measures (e.g., confusion matrices on object recognition tasks).

#### Experiment 2: Language Representations (Human Language Processing vs. LLMs)
- **Biological System:** fMRI or MEG recordings during language comprehension tasks.
- **Artificial Systems:** Representations from different layers of LLMs (GPT, BERT, etc.).
- **Stimuli:** Sentences varying in syntactic complexity, semantic ambiguity, and contextual dependencies.
- **Analysis:** Examine whether alignment predicts similarity in error patterns, generalization to novel linguistic constructions, and robustness to perturbations.

#### Experiment 3: Cross-modality Alignment
- **Systems:** Visual cortex representations vs. language model representations of visual concepts.
- **Stimuli:** Images paired with their textual descriptions.
- **Analysis:** Investigate whether our framework can capture semantic alignment across fundamentally different modalities.

#### Experiment 4: Intervention Study
- Using our framework, we will systematically modify training objectives for artificial neural networks to increase or decrease their representational alignment with biological systems.
- We will measure the effect of these interventions on task performance, generalization capabilities, and robustness.

### 2.7 Evaluation Metrics

We will evaluate the effectiveness of RIFE using the following metrics:

1. **Correlation with Behavioral Similarity:** The correlation between alignment scores and similarities in behavioral patterns (e.g., error distributions, reaction times).

2. **Predictive Power for Transfer Learning:** How well alignment scores predict the effectiveness of knowledge transfer between different neural systems.

3. **Robustness to Architectural Changes:** The stability of alignment scores when comparing different architectural variations of the same system.

4. **Comparison with Existing Methods:** Performance comparison with traditional alignment metrics (RSA, CCA, etc.) across various experimental conditions.
