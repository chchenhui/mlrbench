Title: Reinforcement Learningâ€“Guided Data Curation for Safety-Aligned Foundation Models

Motivation:  
Foundation Models trained on massive, unlabeled corpora often inherit toxic, biased, or misaligned content. Manual filtering is labor-intensive and scales poorly. An automated, data-centric method that dynamically prioritizes safer, alignment-friendly examples can substantially improve model reliability without sacrificing performance.

Main Idea:  
We propose an RL-driven data curation framework that incrementally learns a policy for selecting and weighting training samples to maximize safety and alignment metrics.  
1. Initialize a candidate pool drawn from large, raw text corpora.  
2. Define a composite reward combining (a) toxicity/classification scores from off-the-shelf safety detectors and (b) proxy alignment signals from small human-labeled probes.  
3. Train an RL agent (e.g., PPO) to assign selection probabilities to each sample, sampling mini-batches that optimize cumulative reward.  
4. Periodically fine-tune a lightweight foundation model on the curated batches, evaluate safety/alignment, and refine the reward model.  

Expected outcomes include a scalable, closed-loop data pipeline yielding FMs with significantly reduced harmful outputs and preserved linguistic capabilities. This approach paves the way for automated, data-centric safety alignment at scale.
