# DataCleanse: Automated Detection and Mitigation of Toxicity in Foundation Model Training Data

## Motivation
Foundation Models (FMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMA learn from vast internet-scale datasets, inevitably containing harmful content. This toxic data can lead to models that generate unsafe, biased, or offensive outputs, undermining their reliability and ethical deployment. Current manual content filtering is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often misses subtle forms of toxicity. As foundation models become increasingly integrated into critical applications, ensuring their training data is free from harmful content is not just a technical challenge but a societal imperative.

## Main Idea
DataCleanse is a multi-stage framework for automatically detecting and mitigating toxic content in FM training data. The system employs a hierarchical approach: first, a lightweight toxicity classifier identifies potentially problematic content for deeper analysis. Then, a context-aware evaluator assesses flagged content considering linguistic nuance, educational value, and cultural context. Rather than binary removal, DataCleanse implements a spectrum of interventions including selective redaction, contextual augmentation with counterbalancing content, and toxicity dilution through synthetic data generation. The system continuously improves through human-in-the-loop feedback from diverse demographic evaluators. This approach allows dataset curators to significantly reduce harmful content while preserving valuable educational examples and maintaining training data diversity, directly addressing the safety and alignment challenges in foundation model development.
