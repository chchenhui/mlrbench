**Title:** Dual-Objective Data Curation for Enhancing Alignment and Efficiency in Foundation Models  

**Motivation:** Foundation models (FMs) are trained on massive, diverse datasets, but existing curation methods prioritize generic quality metrics (e.g., deduplication, coherence) rather than addressing alignment with human values or training efficiency. Poorly aligned or redundant data can propagate biases, increase computational costs, and compromise safety. This research addresses the critical need to align data curation with *both* ethical and operational goals, ensuring FMs are efficient, safe, and human-centric.  

**Main Idea:** We propose a framework that dynamically curates training data by optimizing two objectives: (1) *alignment potential*, measured via similarity to human-preferred outputs or safety-filtered benchmarks, and (2) *efficiency contribution*, quantified by a sampleâ€™s estimated impact on reducing training instability or redundancy. A multi-armed bandit system iteratively selects data batches that maximize these dual objectives, using proxy models (e.g., small-scale FMs) to predict alignment and efficiency scores. High-scoring data is prioritized, while low-value samples are deprecated or reweighted. The approach would integrate with active learning loops and leverage lightweight human feedback for calibration. Expected outcomes include reduced training costs (e.g., faster convergence), improved alignment metrics (e.g., reduced harmful outputs), and interpretable data quality scores. This framework could reshape how FM datasets are constructed, balancing performance with ethical and practical constraints.
