Reinforcement Learning–Guided Data Curation for Safety-Aligned Foundation Models

## 2. Introduction

### Background

Foundation Models (FMs), such as GPT-3/4, LLaMA, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion, have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, these models often inherit toxic, biased, or misaligned content from their training data, which can lead to harmful outputs. Traditional manual filtering methods for data curation are labor-intensive and do not scale effectively. This necessitates the development of automated, data-centric methods that can dynamically prioritize safer, alignment-friendly examples to improve model reliability without sacrificing performance.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a reinforcement learning (RL)–guided data curation framework that incrementally learns a policy for selecting and weighting training samples to maximize safety and alignment metrics. This approach aims to:

1. **Improve Safety**: Reduce the occurrence of toxic, biased, or misaligned content in the training data.
2. **Enhance Alignment**: Ensure that the model's outputs align with human values and societal norms.
3. **Scale Effectively**: Develop a scalable, automated data curation pipeline that can handle large, raw text corpora.
4. **Preserve Performance**: Maintain the model's linguistic capabilities and performance on standard tasks.

### Significance

This research addresses a critical challenge in the field of AI safety and alignment. By developing an RL-driven data curation framework, we can significantly improve the reliability of foundation models without the need for extensive manual intervention. This approach has the potential to pave the way for automated, data-centric safety alignment at scale, contributing to the development of more responsible and trustworthy AI systems.

## 3. Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed RL-driven data curation framework consists of the following key components:

1. **Candidate Pool Initialization**: Draw a candidate pool from large, raw text corpora.
2. **Reward Model Definition**: Define a composite reward combining toxicity/classification scores from off-the-shelf safety detectors and proxy alignment signals from small human-labeled probes.
3. **RL Agent Training**: Train an RL agent (e.g., PPO) to assign selection probabilities to each sample, sampling mini-batches that optimize cumulative reward.
4. **Periodic Model Fine-Tuning**: Periodically fine-tune a lightweight foundation model on the curated batches, evaluate safety/alignment, and refine the reward model.

### Data Collection

The candidate pool will be drawn from large, raw text corpora, such as the Common Crawl, Wikipedia, and other public datasets. These corpora will serve as the initial source of training data for the RL agent.

### Reward Model Definition

The reward model will combine two components:

1. **Toxicity/Classification Scores**: Utilize off-the-shelf safety detectors, such as Perspective API, to assign toxicity scores to each sample. These scores will be used as a proxy for the safety of the content.
2. **Proxy Alignment Signals**: Use small, human-labeled probes to evaluate the alignment of each sample with human values. These probes will consist of prompts that assess the model's adherence to safety guidelines, such as avoiding harmful stereotypes or promoting respectful communication.

The composite reward \( R \) will be calculated as follows:

\[ R = \alpha \cdot T + \beta \cdot A \]

where:
- \( T \) is the toxicity score from the safety detector,
- \( A \) is the alignment score from the human-labeled probe,
- \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are weighting factors that balance the importance of toxicity and alignment in the reward function.

### RL Agent Training

The RL agent will be trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The agent will learn to assign selection probabilities to each sample in the candidate pool, with the goal of maximizing the cumulative reward. The PPO algorithm will be implemented using the Stable Baselines3 library.

The training process will involve the following steps:

1. **Initialize the RL agent** with a random policy.
2. **Sample mini-batches** of training samples from the candidate pool based on the current policy.
3. **Compute the reward** for each mini-batch using the composite reward model.
4. **Update the policy** using the PPO algorithm to maximize the cumulative reward.
5. **Repeat** the sampling, reward computation, and policy update steps until convergence.

### Experimental Design

To validate the effectiveness of the RL-driven data curation framework, we will conduct the following experiments:

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare the performance of the RL-driven data curation framework with traditional manual filtering methods and other automated data curation techniques.
2. **Safety and Alignment Evaluation**: Evaluate the safety and alignment of the foundation models trained on the curated data using a set of standard safety and alignment benchmarks.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the linguistic capabilities and performance of the foundation models on standard downstream tasks, such as text classification, question answering, and machine translation.
4. **Scalability Testing**: Test the scalability of the RL-driven data curation framework by applying it to larger and more diverse datasets.

### Evaluation Metrics

The effectiveness of the RL-driven data curation framework will be evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Safety Metrics**: Toxicity scores, harmful output rates, and adherence to safety guidelines.
2. **Alignment Metrics**: Scores from human-labeled probes, alignment with human values, and adherence to safety guidelines.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, F1 score, and other standard evaluation metrics for downstream tasks.
4. **Scalability Metrics**: Time and computational resources required to curate and fine-tune the data.

### Expected Outcomes

The expected outcomes of this research include:

1. **A Scalable, Closed-Loop Data Pipeline**: A data curation pipeline that can handle large, raw text corpora and incrementally learn a policy for selecting and weighting training samples to maximize safety and alignment metrics.
2. **Significantly Reduced Harmful Outputs**: Foundation models trained on the curated data will exhibit significantly reduced harmful outputs, such as toxic language, biased content, and misaligned behavior.
3. **Preserved Linguistic Capabilities**: The curated data will maintain the linguistic capabilities and performance of the foundation models on standard tasks.
4. **Dynamic Alignment**: The RL-driven data curation framework will enable dynamic alignment with human values and evolving societal norms.
