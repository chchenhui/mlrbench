**Title:** Developmental Stage-Aware LLMs for Early Pediatric Disease Detection  

**Motivation:** Childrenâ€™s symptoms and health data vary significantly across developmental stages, but current AI models often treat pediatric populations as homogeneous, leading to inaccurate diagnoses. A developmental stage-aware approach is critical to improve early detection of diseases (e.g., autism, developmental delays) and enable timely interventions, particularly in low-resource settings lacking pediatric specialists.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a large language model (LLM) framework that integrates developmental stage-specific data to enhance disease prediction. The model will ingest multimodal inputs (clinical notes, growth metrics, parental observations) and use a multi-task learning architecture to simultaneously predict disease risk and estimate developmental milestones. By training on age-stratified pediatric datasets and incorporating domain knowledge from child development experts, the model will learn context-aware patterns (e.g., distinguishing typical speech delays from autism red flags). Validation will involve benchmarking against existing pediatric AI tools and clinical assessments. Expected outcomes include improved diagnostic accuracy (especially for rare diseases) and a publicly available developmental stage-annotated dataset. This work could democratize access to early diagnosis in underserved regions and inform personalized care pathways, reducing infant mortality and long-term health disparities.
