**Title:** *Cross-Modal Generative Adversarial Training for Robust Large Multimodal Models*  

**Motivation:**  
Large multimodal models (LMMs) face unique security risks as cross-modal adversarial examples—e.g., toxic text triggering harmful image outputs—can exploit interactions between modalities. Existing adversarial training methods typically target single-modality perturbations, leaving LMMs vulnerable to cross-modal attacks that bypass unimodal defenses. Developing robustness strategies for these interdependent vulnerabilities is critical for applications like content moderation and biomedical imaging, where safety-critical failures are unacceptable.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a cross-modal generative adversarial training (CM-GAT) framework that leverages the intrinsic alignment between modalities in LMMs to synthesize and defend against cross-modal adversarial examples. Our approach uses a multimodal generator (e.g., CLIP or Flamingo-like backbone) to learn attack patterns that perturb one modality (e.g., text) to manipulate outputs in another (e.g., images). These generated adversaries are then used to iteratively refine the LMM’s robustness through a min-max optimization. The generator prioritizes “transferable” attacks that exploit relations between modalities (e.g., adversarial captions corrupting image classifiers). To balance fidelity and security, CM-GAT integrates a contrastive loss that enforces consistency across perturbed and clean data. We will benchmark performance against established cross-modal attacks on vision-language tasks and measure robustness gains using targeted accuracy metrics. The framework could establish a new standard for secure multimodal learning, enabling attack-aware LMMs that proactively generalize to unseen cross-modal threats.
