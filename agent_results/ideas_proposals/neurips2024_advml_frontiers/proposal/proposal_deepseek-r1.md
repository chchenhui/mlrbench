**Cross-Modal Adversarial Immunization: Strengthening LMMs Against Multi-domain Attacks**  

---

### 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have revolutionized AI by integrating vision, language, and other modalities to achieve human-like reasoning. However, their growing complexity introduces vulnerabilities to *cross-modal adversarial attacks*, where perturbations in one modality (e.g., imperceptible image noise) induce errors in another (e.g., text generation). For instance, an adversarial image could cause an autonomous vehicle’s LMM to misinterpret traffic signs or generate unsafe navigation instructions. Current defenses, such as single-modality adversarial training or input preprocessing, fail to address the unique challenges of cross-modal integration points, leaving LMMs exposed to sophisticated multi-domain attacks.  

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal introduces **Cross-Modal Adversarial Immunization (CMAI)**, a novel framework to fortify LMMs against cross-modal threats through three core innovations:  
1. **Cross-Modal Consistency Verification**: A module to detect and correct misalignments between modality representations.  
2. **Modality-Bridging Adversarial Training**: A training regime that generates perturbations targeting cross-modal transfer points.  
3. **Adaptive Robustness Mechanism**: A dynamic system that prioritizes defense resources based on real-time attack patterns.  

**Significance**  
CMAI addresses critical gaps in securing LMMs for high-stakes applications like healthcare diagnostics and autonomous systems. By explicitly modeling cross-modal interactions during defense design, the framework advances the reliability and ethical deployment of multimodal AI.

### 2. Methodology  

#### 2.1 Data Collection  
- **Datasets**: Use multimodal benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Visual Genome, Medical MNIST) and synthetic datasets simulating cross-modal attacks.  
- **Attack Simulation**: Inject perturbations using state-of-the-art methods (e.g., CrossFire [3], I2V [4]) to create adversarial examples across modalities.  
- **Preprocessing**: Normalize inputs and align modality embeddings using pretrained encoders (e.g., CLIP, Flamingo).  

#### 2.2 Cross-Modal Consistency Verification  
This module enforces semantic alignment between modalities by minimizing the distance between their embeddings. Let $\mathbf{e}_i$ and $\mathbf{e}_j$ denote embeddings from modalities $i$ and $j$. The consistency loss is:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}} = \sum_{i,j} \left(1 - \cos(\mathbf{e}_i, \mathbf{e}_j)\right) + \lambda \cdot \text{KL}(p_i \| p_j),
$$  
where $\cos(\cdot)$ measures cosine similarity, $\text{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between modality-specific probability distributions $p_i$ and $p_j$, and $\lambda$ balances the terms. A threshold-based detector flags inputs with $\mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}} > \tau$ as adversarial.  

#### 2.3 Modality-Bridging Adversarial Training  
We extend adversarial training to target cross-modal transfer points. For an input pair $(x_v, x_t)$ (visual and textual), we generate perturbations $\delta_v, \delta_t$ by solving:  
$$
\max_{\|\delta_v\| \leq \epsilon_v, \|\delta_t\| \leq \epsilon_t} \left[ \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(f(x_v + \delta_v, x_t + \delta_t), y) + \alpha \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}} \right],
$$  
where $f$ is the LMM, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$ is the task loss, and $\alpha$ controls the emphasis on cross-modal consistency. Training alternates between updating model parameters and generating perturbations, similar to [8].  

#### 2.4 Adaptive Robustness Mechanism  
A lightweight neural network $g$ dynamically adjusts defense priorities based on detected attack patterns. Let $\mathbf{h}_t$ be the hidden state of the LMM at time $t$. The gating network computes adaptive weights:  
$$
[\beta_{\text{task}}, \beta_{\text{consist}}, \beta_{\text{adv}}] = \text{Softmax}(g(\mathbf{h}_t)),
$$  
which reweight the total loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \beta_{\text{task}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \beta_{\text{consist}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}} + \beta_{\text{adv}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}}.
$$  
The network $g$ is trained via reinforcement learning to maximize robustness metrics over time.  

#### 2.5 Experimental Design  
- **Baselines**: Compare against ProEAT [1], CrossFire defenses [3], and consistency training [6].  
- **Models**: Test on CLIP, Flamingo, and OpenFlamingo.  
- **Attacks**: Evaluate using CrossFire [3], I2V [4], and universal attacks [2].  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**: Percentage of adversarial inputs causing misclassification.  
  - **Clean Accuracy**: Performance on unperturbed data.  
  - **Cross-Modal Consistency Score**: Average cosine similarity between modality embeddings.  
  - **Adaptation Latency**: Time to adjust defense weights after attack detection.  
- **Ablation Studies**: Isolate contributions of each CMAI component.

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Robustness Improvements**: CMAI is expected to reduce ASR by 30–50% compared to ProEAT [1] and consistency training [6], particularly under cross-modal attacks.  
2. **Preserved Clean Performance**: Clean accuracy degradation will be limited to <2% across tasks, outperforming existing adversarial training methods.  
3. **Adaptive Generalization**: The framework will demonstrate resilience to unseen attack patterns, with adaptation latency <100ms.  

**Broader Impact**  
- **Safety-Critical Applications**: Enhanced reliability of LMMs in autonomous systems and healthcare.  
- **Ethical AI**: Mitigation of risks from malicious cross-modal attacks (e.g., disinformation campaigns).  
- **Research Community**: Open-source release of CMAI and datasets to catalyze advancements in adversarial ML.
