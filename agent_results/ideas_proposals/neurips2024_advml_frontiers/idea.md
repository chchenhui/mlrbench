# Cross-Modal Adversarial Immunization: Strengthening LMMs Against Multi-domain Attacks

## Motivation
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly vulnerable to cross-modal adversarial attacks where perturbations in one modality (e.g., subtle image manipulations) trigger errors in another modality (e.g., text reasoning). These vulnerabilities pose serious risks for applications like autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, and content moderation systems. Current defenses typically focus on single-modality protection, leaving models exposed to cross-modal attack vectors that exploit the integration points between different perceptual domains.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel defensive framework called "Cross-Modal Adversarial Immunization" that strengthens LMMs against multi-domain attacks by training models to maintain cross-modal consistency under adversarial conditions. Our approach develops a three-pronged strategy: (1) Introducing a cross-modal consistency verification module that detects misalignments between representations across modalities; (2) Implementing modality-bridging adversarial training that explicitly generates perturbations targeting cross-modal transfer points; and (3) Developing an adaptive robustness mechanism that dynamically adjusts defensive priorities based on detected attack patterns. We expect this approach to significantly improve model robustness while maintaining performance on benign inputs. The framework can be integrated with existing LMMs with minimal modifications, providing an accessible defense strategy for deployment in high-stakes applications where reliability across multiple modalities is critical.
