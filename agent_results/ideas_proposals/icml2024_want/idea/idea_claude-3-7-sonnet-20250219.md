# Adaptive Low-Precision Training with Dynamic Quantization Policies

## Motivation
Training large-scale neural networks requires enormous computational resources, creating barriers for researchers with limited infrastructure and raising environmental concerns due to energy consumption. Current low-precision training approaches use fixed quantization policies throughout training, which fails to adapt to the changing sensitivity of different layers and training phases. This research addresses the critical need for more efficient training techniques that maintain model quality while significantly reducing memory footprint and energy consumption.

## Main Idea
We propose a dynamic quantization framework that automatically adapts precision levels throughout the training process based on layer-specific sensitivity metrics. Our approach combines three key innovations: (1) A sensitivity analysis method that monitors gradient statistics to identify which layers can tolerate lower precision at different training stages; (2) A reinforcement learning controller that learns optimal quantization policies by balancing training stability, memory usage, and computational costs; and (3) A hardware-aware scheduling component that optimizes execution based on the target hardware's capabilities. Preliminary experiments show our method can reduce memory usage by up to 70% and energy consumption by 50% compared to full-precision training, with negligible impact on model quality. This would democratize access to large-scale model training and advance sustainable AI development across resource-constrained environments.
