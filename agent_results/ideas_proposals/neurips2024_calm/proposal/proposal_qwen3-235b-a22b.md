# Counterfactually Guided Fine-tuning for Robust Large Language Models

## Introduction

### Background  
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and Llama have revolutionized natural language processing through their ability to generate coherent, contextually relevant text. However, these models often exhibit brittle behavior when deployed in real-world scenarios involving distribution shifts or safety-critical decisions. This fragility stems from their reliance on spurious statistical correlations in the training data, which may not reflect true causal mechanisms. For example, an LLM trained on clinical records might associate certain demographics with treatment outcomes due to societal biases, rather than medical necessity. Such behaviors pose significant risks in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and legal systems.  

Recent work highlights that LLMs struggle to distinguish correlation from causation (Zhijing *et al.*, 2023), generate causal arguments with unpredictable failures (Kıcıman *et al.*, 2023), and remain vulnerable to spurious patterns (Emily *et al.*, 2024). Counterfactual reasoning—a cornerstone of causal inference—offers a principled framework to address these issues. By enforcing consistency between predictions on factual and counterfactual observations, models can internalize invariant causal mechanisms that generalize beyond the training distribution (Jane & John, 2023; Alice & Lee, 2023).  

### Research Objectives  
This research aims to develop a novel fine-tuning framework for LLMs that systematically injects causal reasoning through counterfactual supervision. The key objectives are:  
1. **Identify spurious correlations** in textual datasets using causal graphs and domain knowledge.  
2. **Automate counterfactual pair generation** that modifies specific causal variables while preserving non-causal elements.  
3. **Design a consistency loss function** that penalizes divergent predictions across counterfactual pairs.  
4. **Empirically validate** the framework’s robustness gains on benchmarks with distribution shifts and fairness constraints.  

### Significance  
By grounding LLMs in causal logic, this work addresses critical gaps in reliability and trustworthiness. Success will enable safer deployment in high-risk applications while advancing theoretical understanding of alignment between neural networks and causal reasoning. The methodology bridges two major research directions from the Causality and Large Models workshop: "Causality for large models" (improving LLMs via causal tools) and "Causality in large models" (auditing their causal knowledge).

## Methodology  

### 1. Data Collection & Causal Graph Construction  
#### Dataset Selection  
Experiments will use:  
- **Synthetic datasets**: Text classification tasks (e.g., IMDb polarity, AG News) corrupted with spurious correlations (demographics → class labels).  
- **Real-world datasets**:  
  - **Bios**: Profession prediction from biographies (gender/ethnicity spuriously correlate with jobs).  
  - **CivilComments**: Toxicity detection with religious/ethnic associations.  

#### Causal Graph Specification  
A directed acyclic graph (DAG) $\mathcal{G} = (\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{E})$ will formalize causal relationships:  
- Nodes $\mathbf{X} = \{X_1, X_2, \dots, Y\}$ represent input features (e.g., $D$: demographics) and outcomes ($Y$: label).  
- Edges encode causal pathways, distinguishing direct cause variables $C \rightarrow Y$ from spurious $P \rightarrow Y$ (e.g., $D \rightarrow P \rightarrow Y$).  

For instance, in Bios: $$(\text{Gender} \rightarrow \text{WritingStyle}) \rightarrow \text{Profession}$$  
Here, $\text{WritingStyle}$ is a mediator variable that introduces spuriousness. The causal objective is to enforce invariance to $\text{Gender}$ while preserving relationships between $\text{WritingStyle}$ and $\text{Profession}$.

### 2. Counterfactual Pair Generation  
Two approaches will generate $(x^\text{fact}, x^\text{cf})$ pairs:  

#### A. Rule-Based Templates  
Pre-defined templates alter spurious features while preserving semantics. For Bios:  
- **Original**: "A nurse describes their compassion for patients."  
- **Counterfactual**: "A nurse describes their compassion" [**"despite being male"**]  

Formally, for each fact $x^\text{fact} = (C=c, P=p, Y=y)$, the counterfactual $x^\text{cf} = (C=1-c, P=p, Y=y^\text{cf})$ retains $P$ but flips $C$, where $y^\text{cf}$ satisfies the counterfactual invariance $P(Y^{C=1-c} = y \mid C=c)$.  

#### B. Generative Model Augmentation  
For complex tasks, counterfactuals will be generated via sequence-to-sequence models (e.g., T5) fine-tuned on paraphrasing datasets. Inputs will be conditioned on causal interventions:  
$$X^\text{cf} \sim p(x \mid \text{do}(C=1-c), \text{context}=p(x))$$  
This ensures minimal edits while enforcing causal variable changes.

### 3. Learning Framework  
#### Model Architecture  
A pretrained LLM (e.g., Llama-7B) will be fine-tuned with a two-stage loss:  
1. **Standard Cross-Entropy (CE)** on factual samples:  
   $$\mathcal{L}_\text{CE} = -\sum_{i=1}^N \left[ y_i \log p_\theta(Y^\text{fact}_i) + (1-y_i) \log (1 - p_\theta(Y^\text{fact}_i)) \right]$$  
2. **Counterfactual Consistency Loss (CCL)** on $M$ pairs:  
   $$\mathcal{L}_\text{CCL} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^M \ell(p_\theta(Y^\text{fact}_j), p_\theta(Y^\text{cf}_j))$$  
   where $\ell$ is symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence or Jensen-Shannon distance.  

#### Optimization Strategy  
- **Two-Step Curriculum Training**:  
  - Phase 1: Freeze causal features $P$ and fine-tune $C$-to-$Y$ invariance using $\mathcal{L}_\text{CCL}$.  
  - Phase 2: Unfreeze all parameters and jointly optimize $\mathcal{L}_\text{CE} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_\text{CCL}$, with $\lambda$ annealed from 0.5 to 0.1.  
- **Efficiency**: Counterfactual batches will alternate with factual batches to prevent overfitting.

### 4. Experimental Design  
#### Baselines  
- Standard fine-tuning with $\mathcal{L}_\text{CE}$.  
- Domain-Adversarial Training (Ganin *et al.*, 2016): Discriminate spurious attributes.  
- Invariant Risk Minimization (Arjovsky *et al.*, 2019): Enforce worst-case spurious correlation robustness.  

#### Evaluation Metrics  
| **Metric** | **Purpose** | **Calculation** |  
|-----------|---------|----------------|  
| Accuracy (in-distribution) | Baseline performance | $\frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{Total}}$ |  
| **Robustness Score** | Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization | $\text{Accuracy}_{\text{OOD}} / \text{Accuracy}_{\text{IND}}$ |  
| **Fairness Differential** | Spurious attribute invariance | $|p(\hat{Y}=1 \mid A=0) - p(\hat{Y}=1 \mid A=1)|$ |  
| Causal Faithfulness | Alignment with $\mathcal{G}$ | Structural Hamming Distance to ground truth DAG |  

#### Ablation Studies  
- Impact of counterfactual generation method (template vs. T5).  
- Sensitivity to $\lambda$ and batch size.  
- Visualization of causal knowledge using attention probes (Wiegreffe *et al.*, 2019).

## Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Anticipated Results  
1. **Improved Robustness**: The proposed framework will achieve ≥15% OOD accuracy improvement over baselines on synthetic datasets corrupted with $p \in \{30\%, 50\%, 70\%\}$ spurious associations.  
2. **Fairness Gains**: Reduce fairness differentials (e.g., gender bias in Bios) by ≥40% while maintaining ±2% in-distribution accuracy.  
3. **Causal Interpretability**: Attention analysis will reveal localized model behavior aligned with $\mathcal{G}$, demonstrating explicit causal knowledge internalization.  

### Broader Impact  
1. **Safety-Critical Applications**: Healthcare diagnostic systems resisting demographic biases and policy tools avoiding historical prejudices.  
2. **Theoretical Contributions**: Formalize connections between counterfactual consistency and intervention-aware learning, influencing future LLM architectures.  
3. **Community Resources**: Open-sourced code, synthetic counterfactual datasets, and benchmarking protocols to accelerate causality-LLM research.  

This work directly addresses the Causality and Large Models workshop’s goals by:  
- **Evaluating causal knowledge** (Direction 1) through consistency metrics.  
- **Augmenting models with causal tools** (Direction 2) via fine-tuning methodology.  
- **Investigating LLM interpretability** (Direction 4) via causal graph comparisons.
