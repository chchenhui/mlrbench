# Correctness-Guided Learning: Enhancing LLM Code Generation with Static Analysis Feedback

## Motivation
Code generation by Large Language Models (LLMs) has seen remarkable progress, but still suffers from reliability issues, particularly with logical errors, security vulnerabilities, and edge cases that slip past standard testing. While incorporating static analyzers as a post-generation verification step has shown promise, this creates a disjointed workflow where the LLM lacks insight into the verification process. This research addresses the gap between powerful code generation capabilities and formal verification by creating a tighter integration loop between these components.

## Main Idea
I propose a reinforcement learning framework where static analysis tools actively guide the LLM's code generation process through systematic feedback loops. The system would function in three key stages: (1) Initial code generation by the LLM; (2) Automated verification using multiple static analyzers that detect issues ranging from security vulnerabilities to algorithmic inefficiencies; and (3) A structured error feedback mechanism that transforms analyzer outputs into precise natural language guidance. The LLM would then learn to incorporate this verification feedback into its next generation attempt. Over time, the model would develop an internal representation of verification criteria and eventually "think like a verifier" during generation. This framework integrates formal methods directly into the generation process rather than treating verification as a separate post-processing step, potentially creating more robust, secure code generation systems that maintain the flexibility of LLMs.
