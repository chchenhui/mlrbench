1. **Title**: Iterative Code Generation with Multi-Tool Verification Feedback Loops  
2. **Motivation**: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating syntactically correct code but often fail to ensure semantic correctness, particularly in low-resource programming languages or safety-critical systems. While formal verification tools (e.g., static analyzers, SMT solvers) can validate properties like memory safety or functional correctness, integrating them into LLM-driven workflows remains ad hoc. Existing approaches typically apply verification as a one-time check, leaving error resolution to manual iteration. Bridging this gap could reduce reliance on human oversight and improve the trustworthiness of AI-generated code.  
3. **Main Idea**: Propose a framework where LLMs generate code in tandem with a suite of formal verification tools, creating a closed-loop system. The LLM first generates code from a specification. Verification tools then analyze the output, flagging violations (e.g., null-pointer dereferences, assertion failures). These violations are translated into natural language feedback and fed back to the LLM, prompting iterative refinement until verification passes. The system dynamically selects tools based on the specificationâ€™s domain (e.g., model checkers for concurrency, theorem provers for algorithms). A benchmark suite of safety-critical tasks (e.g., embedded systems, cryptographic protocols) will evaluate efficacy. Expected outcomes include higher verification pass rates, reduced manual debugging time, and improved generalization to low-resource languages. This work advances the VerifAI goal of merging probabilistic AI with formal guarantees, enabling scalable, trustworthy code generation.
