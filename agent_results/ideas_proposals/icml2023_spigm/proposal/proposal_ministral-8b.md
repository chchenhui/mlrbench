# Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural Networks for Robust Decision Making

## Introduction

### Background

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, with applications ranging from social network analysis to molecular property prediction. However, most GNN implementations provide point estimates without quantifying prediction uncertainty, which is critical in high-stakes applications where decision-makers need to understand the confidence levels associated with model predictions. Current uncertainty quantification methods for GNNs often treat uncertainty as an afterthought rather than integrating it into the core model architecture, leading to unreliable confidence estimates on out-of-distribution data.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a novel Bayesian Graph Neural Network framework that incorporates uncertainty quantification directly into the message-passing architecture. Specifically, we aim to:
1. Develop a variational inference scheme that maintains distributions over node and edge features throughout the computation graph.
2. Introduce learnable uncertainty parameters at each layer of the GNN that propagate and transform alongside feature information.
3. Distinguish between aleatoric uncertainty (data noise) and epistemic uncertainty (model knowledge gaps) through separate parameters.
4. Develop specialized attention mechanisms that weight neighbor contributions based on uncertainty levels.
5. Validate the method through experiments on molecular property prediction, traffic forecasting, and social network analysis.

### Significance

This research addresses a critical gap in the current state-of-the-art by directly integrating uncertainty quantification into the core GNN architecture. By providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates that correlate with actual prediction errors, our method will enhance the reliability and robustness of GNN-based decision-making systems. This will be particularly beneficial in high-stakes applications where the consequences of incorrect predictions can be severe.

## Methodology

### Research Design

#### Data Collection

We will collect datasets from diverse domains, including molecular property prediction, traffic forecasting, and social network analysis. The datasets will include graph-structured data with associated labels and, where possible, additional metadata to facilitate uncertainty quantification.

#### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Model Architecture**:
   - **Bayesian GNN**: We will develop a Bayesian Graph Neural Network (Bayesian GNN) that maintains distributions over node and edge features.
   - **Uncertainty Parameters**: Introduce learnable uncertainty parameters at each layer of the GNN, denoted as $\theta_u$.
   - **Variational Inference**: Implement a variational inference scheme to approximate the posterior distributions over node and edge features, using techniques such as the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).

2. **Uncertainty Quantification**:
   - **Aleatoric Uncertainty**: Model data-related uncertainty (aleatoric) using separate parameters, $\theta_a$.
   - **Epistemic Uncertainty**: Model model-related uncertainty (epistemic) using separate parameters, $\theta_e$.
   - **Attention Mechanism**: Develop a specialized attention mechanism that weights neighbor contributions based on uncertainty levels, denoted as $A_u$.

3. **Training Procedure**:
   - **Loss Function**: Define a loss function that combines the reconstruction loss and the KL-divergence term to optimize the model parameters, $\theta$, and uncertainty parameters, $\theta_u$, $\theta_a$, $\theta_e$.
   - **Optimization**: Use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to optimize the model parameters and uncertainty parameters.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: Measure the accuracy of the model predictions.
   - **Uncertainty Calibration**: Evaluate the calibration of uncertainty estimates using metrics such as the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and the Brier Score.
   - **Out-of-Distribution Performance**: Assess the model's performance on out-of-distribution data to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates.

#### Mathematical Formulation

The Bayesian GNN framework can be formulated as follows:

1. **Node Feature Distribution**:
   $$ p(\mathbf{x}_i) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_i \mid \mu_i, \Sigma_i) $$

2. **Edge Feature Distribution**:
   $$ p(\mathbf{e}_{ij}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{e}_{ij} \mid \mu_{ij}, \Sigma_{ij}) $$

3. **Uncertainty Parameters**:
   $$ \theta_u = \left\{ \mathbf{u}_i, \mathbf{u}_{ij} \right\} $$

4. **Variational Inference**:
   $$ \mathcal{L}(\theta, \theta_u) = \mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{e})} \left[ \log p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{e} \mid \theta) \right] - \text{KL}(q(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{e}) \mid \mid p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{e})) $$

5. **Attention Mechanism**:
   $$ A_u = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{u}_i \cdot \mathbf{u}_j}{\sqrt{d}}\right) $$

6. **Loss Function**:
   $$ \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{reconstruction}} + \text{KL}(q(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{e}) \mid \mid p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{e})) $$

### Experimental Design

We will validate the method through experiments on three datasets:
1. **Molecular Property Prediction**: Use the QM9 dataset to predict molecular properties.
2. **Traffic Forecasting**: Use the Chicago traffic dataset to predict traffic flow.
3. **Social Network Analysis**: Use the Facebook dataset to predict user interactions.

For each dataset, we will:
1. Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Train the Bayesian GNN on the training set and tune hyperparameters using the validation set.
3. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using accuracy, uncertainty calibration metrics, and out-of-distribution performance.
