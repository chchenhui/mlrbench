Title  
Bayesian Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural Networks for Robust Structured Decision Making  

1. Introduction  
1.1 Background  
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful class of models for learning over graph-structured data, achieving state-of-the-art results in chemistry, social networks, traffic forecasting, and more. Traditional GNNs produce point estimates of node or graph properties and lack a principled notion of uncertainty. In many high-stakes applications—drug discovery, fraud detection, infrastructure monitoring—decision makers require not only predictions but also confidence estimates. Recent works (e.g., LGNSDE, conformalized GNNs, evidential probes) have begun to address uncertainty quantification (UQ) in GNNs, but most treat UQ as a post-hoc add-on or rely on expensive ensembles, limiting scalability and reliability, especially under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.

1.2 Research Objectives  
This proposal develops a fully integrated Bayesian Graph Neural Network framework that:  
  •  Embeds aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty directly into the message-passing layers via variational inference.  
  •  Propagates distributions (means and covariances) through each layer rather than single points.  
  •  Introduces uncertainty-aware attention to weight neighbor messages by their estimated reliability.  
  •  Evaluates calibration, OOD detection, and predictive performance on molecular property prediction, traffic forecasting, and social network tasks.

1.3 Significance  
By unifying inference and uncertainty within the core GNN architecture, our approach overcomes limitations of shallow ensembles, energy-based post-hoc methods, and conformal predictors. Well-calibrated uncertainty estimates will enable safer deployment of GNNs in science and industry, fostering trust in automated decisions and guiding experimental designs in drug discovery, resource allocation in transportation, and risk management in finance.

2. Methodology  
2.1 Model Formulation  
We consider a graph $G=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$ with node features $\{x_i\}_{i\in\mathcal{V}}$ and edge features $\{e_{ij}\}_{(i,j)\in\mathcal{E}}$. At each layer $l$, instead of deterministic hidden vectors $h_i^l$, we maintain Gaussian distributions  
$$h_i^l\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu_i^l,\Sigma_i^l)\,.$$  
Node updates incorporate messages from neighbors weighted by uncertainty-aware attention. Let  
$$m_{ij}^{l} = \phi\bigl(h_i^{l-1},h_j^{l-1},e_{ij}\bigr)$$  
denote a differentiable message function (e.g., MLP). We define attention coefficients  
$$\alpha_{ij}^l = \frac{\exp\bigl(a(\mu_i^{l-1},\mu_j^{l-1},\sigma_i^{l-1},\sigma_j^{l-1})\bigr)}{\sum_{k\in\mathcal{N}(i)}\exp\bigl(a(\cdot)\bigr)}$$  
where $a(\cdot)$ is an MLP that takes as input both means and uncertainties $(\sigma^2=\mathrm{diag}(\Sigma))$ of sender and receiver nodes.  

The mean and covariance update rules are:  
$$\mu_i^l = W^l\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)}\alpha_{ij}^l\,\mathbb{E}[m_{ij}^l]\,,\qquad  
\Sigma_i^l = W^l\Bigl(\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)}(\alpha_{ij}^l)^2\mathrm{Cov}(m_{ij}^l)\Bigr)(W^l)^\top + \Sigma_{\text{ale}}^l$$  
where $W^l$ are learnable weight matrices with a prior, and $\Sigma_{\text{ale}}^l$ models layer-wise aleatoric noise. We assume a mean-field Gaussian prior over weights:  
$$p(W^l) = \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{0}^2 I)\,,\qquad  
q(W^l)=\prod_{k}\mathcal{N}(\mu_{W^l_k},\sigma_{W^l_k}^2)\,.$$  

2.2 Variational Inference and ELBO  
We optimize a variational posterior $q(\{W^l\})$ by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the marginal likelihood of targets $Y$:  
$$\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ELBO}} = \mathbb{E}_{q}\bigl[\log p(Y\mid H^L)\bigr]  
- \sum_l \mathrm{KL}\bigl(q(W^l)\,\|\,p(W^l)\bigr)\,. $$  
For regression tasks, $p(y_i\mid h_i^L)=\mathcal{N}(y_i;\,w_o^\top\mu_i^L,\;\sigma_{y,i}^2)$ where $\sigma_{y,i}^2$ includes propagated uncertainty and learned aleatoric term. For classification, we use a probit or softmax likelihood with variance-propagated logits.

We employ the reparameterization trick for weight sampling and Monte Carlo estimates of the expectation. Gradients are computed via automatic differentiation.

2.3 Uncertainty-Aware Attention  
The attention network $a(\cdot)$ is trained to downweight messages from highly uncertain neighbors. Concretely, we augment the input to $a$ with relative uncertainty ratios:  
$$u_{ij} = \frac{\mathrm{tr}(\Sigma_j^{l-1})}{\mathrm{tr}(\Sigma_i^{l-1}) + \mathrm{tr}(\Sigma_j^{l-1})}\,, $$  
so that  
$$\alpha_{ij}^l \propto \exp\Bigl(a\bigl(\mu_i^{l-1},\mu_j^{l-1},u_{ij}\bigr)\Bigr)\,. $$  
This mechanism ensures that nodes rely more heavily on confident neighbors, improving robustness under noise and distribution shift.

2.4 Algorithmic Steps  
Pseudocode for training one epoch:  
1. Sample weights $\{W^l\}\sim q(\{W^l\})$ via reparameterization.  
2. Initialize $(\mu_i^0,\Sigma_i^0)$ from input $x_i$ with a fixed encoding layer.  
3. For each layer $l=1,\dots,L$:  
 a. Compute $m_{ij}^l=\phi(\mu_i^{l-1},\mu_j^{l-1},e_{ij})$ and covariance $\mathrm{Cov}(m_{ij}^l)$ via Jacobian propagation.  
 b. Compute attention scores $\alpha_{ij}^l$ using $a(\cdot)$.  
 c. Update $\mu_i^l$ and $\Sigma_i^l$ as above.  
4. Compute likelihood term $\mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(Y\mid H^L)]$ using the per-node predictive distributions.  
5. Compute KL divergence over all layers.  
6. Backpropagate and update $\mu_{W},\sigma_{W}$ and neural network parameters in $\phi,a,w_o,\Sigma_{\text{ale}}^l$.  

2.5 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
We will evaluate on three domains:  
• Molecular property prediction (QM9, MoleculeNet). Use scaffolding splits for OOD testing. Node features: atom types; edge features: bond types.  
• Traffic forecasting (PeMS): nodes are sensors, edges by road adjacency or learned similarity. Target: future traffic flow. Spatial–temporal graphs processed by our spatiotemporal variant.  
• Social network classification (Cora, Citeseer): semi-supervised node classification with citation graphs. OOD simulated by community holdout.  

Standard normalization, train/val/test splits, data augmentation (drop edges, mask features) to stress test OOD performance.

2.6 Experimental Design  
Baselines: deterministic GNN (GCN, GAT), deep ensembles (5 models), DPOSE, LGNSDE, CF-GNN, EPN.  
Experiments:  
• Calibration: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Calibration curves.  
• Predictive accuracy: RMSE for regression, accuracy & F1 for classification.  
• Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), Brier Score.  
• OOD detection: AUROC based on predictive entropy or variance.  
• Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and interval width.  

Ablations:  
• Remove uncertainty-aware attention.  
• Share vs. separate aleatoric parameters across layers.  
• Vary number of Monte Carlo samples per update.  

Hardware: GPUs (NVIDIA A100), memory profiling to measure overhead.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
3.1 Anticipated Results  
• Superior calibration: our method will achieve ECE < 2% on in-domain tasks, outperforming deep ensembles by ≥50% relative reduction.  
• Robust OOD detection: AUROC > 0.9 in OOD node classification and regression tasks, surpassing conformal and energy-based methods.  
• Comparable or better predictive accuracy: match state-of-the-art RMSE on QM9 and PeMS, while providing uncertainty.  
• Efficient inference: only 2–3× overhead compared to deterministic GNN, significantly less than 10× for deep ensembles.

3.2 Broader Impact  
This research integrates structured probabilistic inference directly into generative modeling of graphs, addressing a key gap in the workshop’s scope. The principled separation of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty advances both theory and practice. Practitioners in drug discovery will be able to prioritize molecules with high predicted properties and low uncertainty; transportation agencies can allocate resources based on forecast confidence; social scientists can interpret network analysis results with calibrated trust. The open-source implementation will foster community adoption and further research in probabilistic GNNs.

By bringing together Bayesian inference, variational methods, and graph modeling, this work will catalyze new collaborations across academia and industry, aligning with the workshop’s goal of structured probabilistic inference & generative modeling on complex data modalities.
