1. Title  
Adaptive Learning Rate Scaling for Efficient Transformer-based Large Language Model Pretraining  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Training state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) now routinely requires hundreds of GPU-years and costs on the order of tens of millions of dollars. Beyond monetary expense, extensive training incurs substantial environmental impact. A primary driver of this cost is hyperparameter tuning—particularly the choice of learning rates—which is often done by heuristic grid or random search over a high-dimensional space. Recent works (Li et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2024; Bjorck et al., 2024) have begun to unveil power-law scaling relationships between model size, data size, and optimal learning rates, but a systematic, theory-driven framework for predicting adaptive learning rates across arbitrary transformer scales is still lacking.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop, validate, and release an end-to-end framework that:  
• Derives closed-form scaling laws for optimal learning rates as a function of model width ($N$), depth ($D$), and training data size ($S$).  
• Integrates spectral analysis of the Hessian to ground these scaling laws in curvature information.  
• Empirically fits the scaling exponents on small- to medium-scale transformers and extrapolates to billion-parameter regimes without costly grid searches.  
• Delivers an open-source library compatible with major deep learning frameworks, reducing training time by 25–40% on billion-parameter LLMs.  

Significance  
By replacing ad-hoc learning-rate schedules with theoretically motivated, size-dependent rules, we expect to:  
• Slash the compute and financial outlay of LLM pretraining.  
• Lower carbon emissions by reducing wasted epochs and hyperparameter sweeps.  
• Democratize access to LLM training for smaller labs and companies.  
• Provide insights into the interplay between optimization algorithms, curvature, and generalization in large-scale nonconvex settings.  

3. Methodology  
Our methodology comprises four stages: (1) data collection, (2) Hessian spectral analysis, (3) scaling-law derivation and fitting, and (4) large-scale validation.  

3.1 Data Collection  
We will train a family of transformer models on the C4 text corpus under controlled settings:  
– Model widths $N\in\{512,1024,2048\}$  
– Model depths $D\in\{12,24,48\}$  
– Dataset sizes $S\in\{10^8,10^9,10^{10}\text{ tokens}\}$  
– Batch sizes $B\in\{512,1024,2048\}$  
For each $(N,D,S,B)$ combination, we perform a coarse grid search over learning rates $\eta\in[10^{-5},10^{-2}]$ (log-uniform) to identify the empirical optimal $\eta^*_{N,D,S,B}$, defined as the rate minimizing validation perplexity within a fixed compute budget. We record:  
• Training loss $L_t(\theta)$ at each step $t$.  
• Validation loss $L_\mathrm{val}$.  
• GPU-hours and energy consumption (via NVIDIA’s nvml API).  

3.2 Hessian Spectral Analysis  
To ground learning-rate predictions in local curvature, we estimate the top eigenvalues of the Hessian $H(\theta)=\nabla^2_\theta L(\theta)$ at several checkpoints ($t=100,500,1000$). We use the stochastic Lanczos method with $k=20$ Lanczos vectors to approximate the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\max}(t)$. Empirically we observe $\lambda_{\max}(t)$ stabilizes after a few hundred steps. Under a quadratic approximation, the maximum stable learning rate for (stochastic) gradient descent satisfies  
$$  
\eta_{\max}(t) \approx \frac{2(1-\beta)}{\lambda_{\max}(t)}\,,  
$$  
where $\beta$ is the momentum coefficient. For Adam-style optimizers, we adjust this by the estimated second-moment parameter. We then average over checkpoints to obtain a curvature-based estimate $\bar\lambda_{\max}(N,D,S,B)$.  

3.3 Scaling-Law Derivation and Fitting  
Building on prior observations (Li et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2024), we posit a multivariate power-law form:  
$$  
\eta^*(N,D,S,B) = c \, N^{-\alpha} \, D^{-\beta} \, S^{-\gamma} \, B^{-\delta}\,.  
$$  
Taking logarithms yields a linear regression problem:  
$$  
\log \eta^* = \log c - \alpha\log N - \beta\log D - \gamma\log S - \delta\log B + \varepsilon\,,  
$$  
where $\varepsilon$ captures residual errors. We fit $(c,\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)$ via robust (Huber) regression using the collected $(N,D,S,B,\eta^*)$ dataset. We validate the fit with $k$-fold cross-validation and report $R^2$ and mean absolute error on held-out points.  

We further refine the fit by incorporating the curvature estimate $\bar\lambda_{\max}$ as a predictor:  
$$  
\eta^* \approx \kappa \,\bigl[\bar\lambda_{\max}(N,D,S,B)\bigr]^{-1}\,,  
$$  
and compare predictive power against the pure power-law model.  

3.4 Algorithmic Framework  
The following pseudocode summarizes the proposed library usage:  

```
Input: target model dims (N_target, D_target), data size S_target, batch B_target  
1. Load pre-computed scaling parameters (c,α,β,γ,δ).  
2. Predict learning rate:  
   η_pred = c * N_target^(−α) * D_target^(−β) * S_target^(−γ) * B_target^(−δ)  
3. (Optional) Fetch curvature estimate λ̄ from small-scale proxy, then  
   η_curv ← κ / λ̄  
4. Set training schedule: warm-up + cosine decay with peak η=max(η_pred,η_curv)  
5. Train model.  
```

3.5 Large-Scale Validation  
We will validate our scaling laws on two fronts:  

A. Billion-Parameter LLM Pretraining  
– Models: 1B, 5B, and 10B parameter transformers.  
– Baselines:  
   • Standard cosine learning-rate schedule (Liu et al., 2020)  
   • Heuristic linear warm-up + inverse sqrt decay.  
– Metrics:  
   1. Time-to-target (GPU-hours to reach a reference validation loss).  
   2. Final perplexity after fixed compute budget.  
   3. Downstream zero-shot and few-shot tasks (e.g., LAMBADA PPL, format-transfer accuracy).  
   4. Energy consumption (kWh).  

B. Cross-Architecture Generalization  
– Apply predicted schedules to:  
   • Vision transformers (Zhai et al., 2021) on ImageNet.  
   • MLP-mixers on language modeling tasks.  
– Measure performance gap vs baseline schedules to assess generality.  

Ablations  
• Remove each predictor (N, D, S, B, curvature) to quantify its contribution.  
• Test robustness under data distribution shifts (e.g., pretraining on The Pile vs. C4).  
• Evaluate sensitivity to momentum coefficient $\beta$ and Adam parameters.  

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Expected Outcomes  
• A validated, closed-form scaling law for learning rates that achieves $R^2>0.95$ in predicting $\log\eta^*$ across small- to medium-scale models.  
• Empirical demonstration of 25–40% reduced time-to-target on 1B–10B parameter LLMs, with no degradation in final perplexity.  
• An open-source Python library (“LRScale”) with ready-to-use APIs for PyTorch and JAX, including pre-fitted scaling parameters.  
• A deeper theoretical understanding of how Hessian spectral properties govern learning-rate limits in nonconvex, high-dimensional settings.  

Broader Impact  
The proposed framework stands to:  
• Dramatically lower the barrier to entry for training large models, broadening participation in AI research.  
• Reduce the environmental footprint of LLM training by cutting redundant hyperparameter sweeps.  
• Influence future work on adaptive optimizers by highlighting curvature-informed scheduling.  
• Bridge communities in optimization and deep learning by providing a concrete example of theory-inspired, large-scale algorithm design.  

In summary, this research will deliver both theoretical insights and practical tools for “scaling up optimization” in modern machine learning, aligning with the goals of the OPT 2024 workshop and advancing the state of the art in large-scale model training.
