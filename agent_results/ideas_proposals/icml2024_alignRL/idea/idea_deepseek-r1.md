**Title:** Empirical-Driven Theoretical Frameworks for Bridging RL Theory and Practice  

**Motivation:** The divergence between RL theory and practice stems from theorists focusing on idealized settings and worst-case guarantees, while experimentalists rely on heuristics tailored to specific tasks. This gap hinders the development of broadly applicable, theoretically sound algorithms. Addressing this requires a systematic approach to integrate empirical insights into theoretical formulations, ensuring algorithms are both practical and robust.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a methodology to extract structural patterns from empirically successful RL algorithms and formalize them as theoretical assumptions. First, conduct a meta-analysis of high-performing empirical RL methods (e.g., in robotics or game environments) to identify common heuristics, such as adaptive exploration or reward shaping. Next, translate these heuristics into mathematical properties (e.g., constrained MDP structures or smoothness assumptions). Using these properties, theorists can design algorithms with provable guarantees under the derived assumptions. Finally, validate the new algorithms on real-world tasks to ensure they retain empirical effectiveness.  

**Expected Outcomes & Impact:** The framework will yield algorithms with dual theoretical-practical strengths and a shared repository of problem classes aligned with real-world structures. This synergy could accelerate RL adoption in safety-critical domains by improving robustness while maintaining performance, fostering collaboration through a common language between theorists and experimentalists.
