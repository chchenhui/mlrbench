### Title: Bridging the Gap: A Multi-Model Framework for Reinforcement Learning

### Motivation
The rapid evolution of reinforcement learning (RL) has led to significant breakthroughs, but the gap between theoretical and practical applications remains substantial. Theorists often develop algorithms in simplified settings, while experimentalists face real-world complexities. This disconnect hinders the effective translation of theoretical advancements into practical solutions. Bridging this gap is crucial to unlock the full potential of RL.

### Main Idea
To address this, we propose a multi-model framework that integrates theoretical insights with empirical data. The framework comprises three components: a theoretical model, a practical model, and a hybrid model. The theoretical model focuses on developing and analyzing algorithms in simplified settings, providing theoretical guarantees. The practical model, on the other hand, evaluates these algorithms in real-world scenarios, identifying challenges and suggesting improvements. The hybrid model combines these insights to create robust, practical algorithms. This framework will facilitate knowledge exchange and collaboration between theorists and experimentalists.

The methodology involves:
1. **Theoretical Model:** Developing and analyzing RL algorithms in controlled environments.
2. **Practical Model:** Implementing and testing these algorithms in real-world scenarios, identifying practical challenges.
3. **Hybrid Model:** Combining theoretical insights and practical data to create resilient algorithms.

Expected outcomes include:
- Enhanced understanding of RL in real-world scenarios.
- Development of more robust and practical RL algorithms.
- Improved collaboration and knowledge exchange between theorists and experimentalists.

Potential impact:
- Faster and more effective translation of theoretical RL research into practical applications.
- Advancement in solving complex real-world problems using RL.
- Strengthening the RL community by fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.
