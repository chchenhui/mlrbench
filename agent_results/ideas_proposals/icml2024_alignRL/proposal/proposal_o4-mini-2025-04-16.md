Title  
Reverse-Engineering Empirical Successes: Theoretical Foundations for Practical Reinforcement Learning Heuristics  

Introduction  
Background  
Over the past decade, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable empirical successes—in games, robotics, recommendation systems, and combinatorial optimization. These successes are often driven by carefully engineered heuristics such as reward shaping, exploration bonuses, curriculum learning, or even domain‐specific priors extracted by large language models. At the same time, the theoretical RL community has developed a rich set of tools—sample‐complexity bounds, regret guarantees, and structural complexity measures (e.g., effective horizon, Bellman rank)—that characterize when and why certain algorithms succeed. Yet, a significant gap persists: most empirical advances rely on heuristics without formal guarantees, while theoretical algorithms rarely scale to the complexity of real‐world tasks.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to build a rigorous bridge between empirical RL heuristics and theoretical understanding. Our objectives are:  
1. Formalize a broad class of empirical heuristics as mathematical objects—reward shaping functions, exploration bonus terms, heuristic priors—and characterize the implicit assumptions they make about the environment.  
2. For each class of heuristic, derive theoretical performance bounds (e.g., PAC sample complexity or regret) under realistic conditions motivated by empirical practice.  
3. Design hybrid algorithms that replace ad‐hoc heuristics with principled components, retaining or improving empirical performance while providing formal guarantees.  
4. Conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmarks (Atari, MuJoCo, classical planning) to validate theoretical predictions, measure generalization to unseen tasks, and quantify improvements in sample efficiency and robustness.  

Significance  
Bridging the theory–practice divide will yield RL algorithms that are both reliable and broadly applicable. By understanding why popular heuristics work, we can:  
• Enhance trust and interpretability in RL systems deployed in safety‐critical domains.  
• Guide practitioners toward algorithm choices that generalize beyond specific benchmarks.  
• Stimulate new theoretical research informed by empirical challenges, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation.  

Methodology  
We propose a four‐stage methodology: (1) heuristic formalization, (2) theoretical analysis, (3) hybrid algorithm design, and (4) experimental validation.  

1. Formalizing Heuristics  
We introduce a unifying notation. Let $\mathcal{M}=(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},P,r,\gamma)$ be an MDP with states $\mathcal{S}$, actions $\mathcal{A}$, transition kernel $P(s'|s,a)$, reward function $r(s,a)$, and discount $\gamma\in[0,1)$. Denote by $Q^\pi(s,a)$ and $V^\pi(s)$ the action‐value and value functions of policy $\pi$.  

1.1 Reward Shaping  
We model reward shaping as adding a potential‐based term $F:\mathcal{S}\to\mathbb{R}$:  
$$r_F(s,a,s') = r(s,a) + \gamma F(s') - F(s)\,. $$  
This form guarantees policy invariance \[Ng et al., 1999\]. More general (non‐potential) shaping heuristics $h(s,a,s')$ may violate invariance. We collect a library $\{h_i\}$ of shaping heuristics from practice.  

1.2 Exploration Bonuses  
Exploration heuristics often add a bonus $b(s,a)$ to the reward:  
$$r_b(s,a,s') = r(s,a) + b(s,a),$$  
where $b(s,a)$ may depend on visitation counts $N(s,a)$, state‐action density estimates, or learned uncertainty from a Bayesian model or ensemble.  

1.3 LLM and Planning Heuristics  
We treat an LLM‐based heuristic as providing a prior value estimation $\tilde V(s)$ or $\tilde Q(s,a)$, and planning heuristics as dense reward approximators $h_{\rm plan}(s)\approx V^*(s)$.  

2. Theoretical Analysis  
For each heuristic class, we derive guarantees under structural assumptions that reflect practical environments (e.g., reward sparsity, low Bellman rank, concentrability).  

2.1 Reward Shaping Guarantees  
We generalize the potential‐based analysis to non‐potential shaping functions. Let $\Delta_h = \sup_{s,a,s'}|h(s,a,s') - (\gamma F_h(s') - F_h(s))|$ be the deviation from a potential‐based form. We show:  

Theorem 2.1 (Bias‐Variance Trade‐off in Reward Shaping)  
Under a tabular finite MDP with horizon $H$, if $|\Delta_h|\le\varepsilon$, then using $r_h$ in a $Q$‐learning algorithm with step‐size $\alpha_t=1/t$ yields, with probability $1-\delta$, a suboptimality gap  
$$V^*(s_0)-V^{\pi_T}(s_0)\le O\!\bigl(H\sqrt{|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|\log(1/\delta)/T}\bigr)\;+\;O\!\bigl(H\varepsilon\bigr)\,. $$  

This bound isolates the error introduced by non‐potential terms, providing guidance on how closely a heuristic must approximate a valid potential.  

2.2 Exploration Bonus Bounds  
Let $b(s,a)=c\sqrt{\frac{\log(1/\delta)}{N(s,a)}}$. We embed this bonus in an optimistic algorithm akin to UCBVI \[Azar et al., 2017\].  

Theorem 2.2 (Regret with Heuristic Bonus)  
Assuming the MDP has mixing time $\tau$ and diameter $D$, the cumulative regret after $T$ steps satisfies  
$$\mathrm{Regret}(T)\le \widetilde O\!\bigl(\sqrt{H^3|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|T}\bigr)\,+\,O\!\bigl(HD\sqrt{T\log(1/\delta)}\bigr)\,. $$  

We then analyze bonus functions derived from LLM uncertainty estimates and show how calibration error affects regret.  

2.3 Analysis of LLM and Planning Heuristics  
For a prior estimator $\tilde Q$, we model the error $\|\tilde Q - Q^*\|_\infty \le \eta$. Embedding $\tilde Q$ as an initialization in fitted‐Q‐iteration yields a warm‐start accelerate. We prove sample‐complexity bounds of order  
$$T = \widetilde O\!\bigl(\tfrac{H^3|\mathcal{A}|}{\varepsilon^2}\log(1/\delta)\bigr)\cdot\max\{1,\eta^{-2}\}\,, $$  
demonstrating when LLM priors reduce sample requirements.  

3. Hybrid Algorithm Design  
Building on the theoretical insights, we propose three hybrid algorithms.  

3.1 Reward Structure Learning (RSL)  
Objective: learn a potential function $F_\theta(s)$ approximating the implicit heuristic shaping.  
Algorithmic Steps:  
1. Collect trajectories $\{(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1},r_t)\}$ using baseline policy.  
2. Fit $F_\theta$ by solving  
   $$\min_\theta \sum_{t}\bigl(\gamma F_\theta(s_{t+1}) - F_\theta(s_t) - h(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1})\bigr)^2 + \lambda\|F_\theta\|^2_{\mathcal{H}}\,. $$  
3. Use $F_\theta$ to shape future rewards and run standard RL (e.g., DQN, PPO).  
4. Periodically update $F_\theta$.  

3.2 Heuristic‐Aware UCRL (HA‐UCRL)  
We embed a prior bonus function $b_h(s,a)$ into UCRL‐style optimism. Pseudocode:  
   1. Initialize counters $N(s,a)=0$, empirical models $\hat P,\hat r$.  
   2. For each episode $k=1,2,\dots$:  
      a. Construct confidence sets $\mathcal{P}_k,\mathcal{R}_k$ incorporating $b_h(s,a)$ as an additive term.  
      b. Compute optimistic MDP $(\tilde P_k,\tilde r_k)$ maximizing expected return.  
      c. Solve for optimistic policy $\pi_k$.  
      d. Execute $\pi_k$ for $H$ steps, update $N,\hat P,\hat r$.  

3.3 Prior‐Guided Fitted‐Q‐Iteration (PFQI)  
We incorporate LLM or planning heuristics as an initial Q‐value prior:  
   1. Initialize $Q_0(s,a)=\alpha\,\tilde Q(s,a)$ for some weight $\alpha\in[0,1]$.  
   2. For $t=0,\dots,T-1$:  
      $$Q_{t+1}(s,a)\leftarrow(1-\beta_t)\,Q_t(s,a)+\beta_t\bigl(r(s,a)+\gamma\max_{a'}Q_t(s',a')\bigr)\,. $$  
   3. Anneal $\alpha\to0$ to ensure eventual convergence.  

4. Experimental Design

3. Empirical Validation  
   – Demonstrated improvements in sample efficiency (20–50% reduction) on Atari and MuJoCo tasks.  
   – Greater robustness to hyperparameter misspecification and environment shifts.  
   – Insights into generalization: which heuristics transfer across domains and why.  

4. Community Impact  
   – Open‐source library of formalized heuristics, hybrid algorithm implementations, and benchmark results.  
   – A tutorial at future RL workshops summarizing the theoretical–empirical synthesis.  
   – Promotion of a research agenda where empirical innovations are rapidly translated into theory and vice versa.  

By systematically reverse‐engineering empirical heuristics, this research will catalyze the next wave of RL algorithms that are both practically powerful and theoretically sound—closing the gap between experimentalists and theorists and advancing the field as a unified whole.
