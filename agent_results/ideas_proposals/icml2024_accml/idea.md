Title: ActiveLoop – Lab-in-the-Loop Active Fine-Tuning for Efficient Biological Foundation Models

Motivation: Rapid cycles between ML predictions and wet-lab experiments can dramatically accelerate biological discovery. Yet large foundation models demand extensive compute and rarely adapt iteratively to new lab data. ActiveLoop bridges this gap by coupling uncertainty-driven experiment selection with resource-efficient model updates, empowering modest labs to harness foundation models in real time.

Main Idea: We propose a modular pipeline that (1) initializes from a pre-trained biological foundation model (e.g., protein language model) and attaches lightweight low-rank adapters for fast fine-tuning on local GPUs; (2) employs Bayesian active learning to rank candidate experiments by predictive uncertainty, guiding wet-lab assays toward maximal information gain; and (3) uses knowledge distillation to compress the updated model into a compact student network deployable on modest hardware. A cloud-based interface manages experiment proposals, records outcomes, and triggers asynchronous adapter updates. Through iterative cycles—predict, test, update—ActiveLoop converges on specialized models tailored to each lab’s targets, slashing GPU hours and experimental cost. This framework democratizes advanced ML in biology, aligns computational predictions with empirical feedback, and accelerates hypothesis-driven discovery.
