# Self-Regularized Interpretation Networks for Climate Science

## Motivation
Climate models are essential for understanding and predicting climate change, but they often function as black boxes, making it difficult to derive new scientific insights from their predictions. Traditional post-hoc explanation methods can be inconsistent and unreliable, especially for complex climate systems where small changes in input can lead to drastically different outcomes. We need models that not only predict climate patterns accurately but also explain their reasoning in a scientifically meaningful way, enabling climate scientists to discover new relationships and mechanisms in our changing climate.

## Main Idea
I propose Self-Regularized Interpretation Networks (SRINs), a novel ante-hoc interpretable architecture specifically designed for climate science applications. SRINs integrate interpretation directly into the learning process by adding self-regularization terms that enforce physical consistency and interpretability. The model architecture consists of modular components representing different climate processes (atmospheric circulation, ocean heat transfer, etc.), each constrained to operate within physically plausible bounds. During training, the model optimizes both prediction accuracy and interpretation quality, using physics-based regularizers that enforce conservation laws and known climate dynamics. This approach enables the model to autonomously discover meaningful climate patterns and potential causal relationships, presenting them alongside predictions through attention-based visualization channels that highlight critical spatiotemporal features governing climate phenomena.
