**Key Challenges:**

1. **Complexity of Legal Text Interpretation**: Accurately parsing and understanding the nuanced language of legal documents to extract rights, obligations, and prohibitions remains a significant challenge.

2. **Formalization of Legal Norms**: Translating extracted legal norms into formal representations, such as first-order logic predicates, that can be effectively integrated into machine learning models is complex and error-prone.

3. **Integration of Constraints into ML Training**: Incorporating legal constraints as differentiable penalty functions within machine learning loss functions requires sophisticated optimization techniques and can impact model performance.

4. **Scalability and Adaptability**: Developing systems that can scale across various regulations and adapt to evolving policies without extensive manual intervention is a persistent challenge.

5. **Balancing Compliance and Performance**: Ensuring that machine learning models adhere to regulatory requirements while maintaining high task performance involves navigating trade-offs and potential conflicts between compliance and accuracy.
