Title  
Policy2Constraint: Automated Translation of Regulatory Text into Differentiable Constraints for Compliant Machine Learning  

1. Introduction  
Background  
The rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) in domains from finance to healthcare has triggered a wave of regulatory interventions (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, EU AI Act) aimed at protecting individual rights, ensuring fairness, and enforcing data‐use obligations. Despite rich theoretical work on fairness, privacy, explainability, and robustness, practitioners often struggle to operationalize abstract legal requirements within ML pipelines. Manual codification of regulations into constraint functions is laborious, error‐prone, and difficult to maintain as policies evolve. This “regulation‐implementation gap” impedes compliance, exposes organizations to legal risk, and limits the social trustworthiness of automated systems.  

Objectives  
We propose Policy2Constraint, a three‐stage, end‐to‐end framework that automatically transforms normative statements in regulatory texts into differentiable penalty functions, then integrates them into standard ML training loops. The core research objectives are:  
  • To design a domain‐tuned Regulatory NLP module that semantically parses legal documents and extracts actionable norms (rights, obligations, prohibitions).  
  • To develop a Formalization engine that maps extracted norms into first‐order logic predicates and then into smooth, differentiable penalty functions.  
  • To construct a Constrained Optimization pipeline that ingests these penalty functions as soft constraints in multi‐objective ML training and evaluates trade‐offs between task performance and compliance.  

Significance  
Policy2Constraint will bridge the gap between regulatory text and ML implementations by automating a pipeline that currently demands legal experts, ML engineers, and significant manual effort. Deliverables include an open‐source toolkit, empirical benchmarks on credit‐scoring and GDPR case studies, and a set of best‐practice guidelines. Ultimately, the project will enable faster, more reliable deployment of regulation‐aligned ML systems, reducing legal exposure and fostering public trust.  

2. Methodology  
Our approach comprises three stages: (1) Regulatory NLP, (2) Formalization, and (3) Constrained Optimization. We describe data sources, algorithms, and experimental designs below.  

2.1 Data Collection  
  • Regulatory Corpora: Official texts of GDPR, U.S. Fair Housing Act, EU AI Act, and CCPA.  
  • Annotated Norm Dataset: We will crowdsource annotations of “norm triples” (subject, predicate, object) on 5K sentences (drawing inspiration from LegiLM [Zhu et al., 2024]). Each norm is categorized as a right, obligation, or prohibition.  
  • Case‐Study Datasets:  
    – Credit Scoring: German Credit dataset (1K examples) and Adult Income Census (~48K examples).  
    – GDPR‐style Data Usage: A synthetic log dataset with user records annotated for sensitive attributes and consent categories.  

2.2 Stage 1: Regulatory NLP (Norm Extraction)  
We adapt a three‐component semantic parsing pipeline:  
  1. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Fine‐tune a Legal‐BERT model on our annotated norm dataset to recognize entities (e.g., “data subject,” “controller”).  
  2. Relation Extraction: Use a graph‐based parser (akin to A Case Study for Compliance as Code [Ershov, 2023]) to link entities via typed edges (e.g., “hasRight,” “mustNotShare”).  
  3. Semantic Role Labeling (SRL): Assign roles (agent, action, patient) to capture the dynamics of each norm.  

Algorithm 1: Norm Extraction  
Input: Regulatory text $T$; pretrained Legal‐BERT parameters $\phi_{B}$  
Output: Set of norm triples $\mathcal{N} = \{(s,p,o)\}$  
Steps:  
  1. Tokenize $T$ into sentences $\{S_i\}$.  
  2. For each $S_i$:  
     a. Apply NER: identify entities $E_i = \{e_{ij}\}$ via Legal‐BERT($\phi_{B}$).  
     b. Perform SRL to label arguments.  
     c. Execute relation extraction to link $(e_{i,a},e_{i,b})$ pairs with predicate $p_{i}$.  
  3. Aggregate and deduplicate $\mathcal{N}$.  

2.3 Stage 2: Formalization (Logic to Penalty)  
Each extracted norm $(s,p,o)$ is mapped into a first‐order logic (FOL) predicate. Example:  
  • Norm: “Controllers must obtain consent before processing personal data.”  
  • FOL: $\forall x\,( \text{process}(x)\rightarrow \text{consent}(x))$.  

We then translate each predicate into a differentiable penalty function. Let $\theta$ denote ML model parameters. Suppose we have dataset $\mathcal{D}=\{(x_i,y_i)\}$ and a model $f_\theta$. We define:  
  • Task loss: $L_{\text{task}}(\theta)=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}|}\sum_i \ell(f_\theta(x_i),y_i)$.  
  • Constraint violation function $g_j(\theta)$ for norm $j$. For example, if norm $j$ demands $P(\hat{Y}\,\vert\,A=0)=P(\hat{Y}\,\vert\,A=1)$ (demographic parity), then  
$$g_j(\theta) \;=\;\bigl|\,P(\hat{Y}=1 \mid A=0)-P(\hat{Y}=1 \mid A=1)\bigr|\,. $$  
  • Soft penalty:  
$$L_{c,j}(\theta) \;=\;\lambda_j\;\max\!\bigl(\,0,\;g_j(\theta)-\tau_j\bigr)^2\,, $$  
where $\tau_j$ is a tolerance threshold (often $\tau_j=0$) and $\lambda_j$ is a Lagrange‐style weight.  

Total loss:  
$$L(\theta)\;=\;L_{\text{task}}(\theta)\;+\;\sum_j L_{c,j}(\theta)\,. $$  

2.4 Stage 3: Constrained Optimization  
We solve $\min_\theta L(\theta)$ using off‐the‐shelf optimizers (e.g., Adam) for soft constraints, and NSGA‐II for explicit multi‐objective trade‐off exploration.  

Experimental Design  
  • Baselines:  
    1. Unconstrained ML (standard cross‐entropy or MSE).  
    2. Manually coded constraint functions.  
    3. ACT framework [Wang et al., 2024] for aligning LLMs to constraints.  
  • Policy2Constraint variants:  
    • P2C‐Soft: Soft constraints as above.  
    • P2C‐MO: Multi‐objective via NSGA‐II.  
  • Metrics:  
    – Task Performance: Accuracy, AUC‐ROC, RMSE.  
    – Fairness: Demographic parity difference, equalized odds gap.  
    – Privacy: Empirical membership‐inference risk, $\varepsilon$ in differential privacy.  
    – Compliance Score: Fraction of extracted norms with $g_j(\theta)\le\tau_j$.  
    – Explanation Quality: Mean explanation fidelity (using SHAP) to penalties.  
  • Ablation Studies:  
    – Impact of Regulatory NLP errors on final compliance.  
    – Sensitivity to weight $\lambda_j$ and threshold $\tau_j$.  
    – Cross‐jurisdiction generalization: train on GDPR norms, test on CCPA.  
  • Statistical Validation:  
    – 5‐fold cross‐validation for predictive performance.  
    – Paired t‐tests or Wilcoxon signed‐rank tests on fairness/compliance metrics.

Impact on Research & Practice  
  • Bridging Theory and Regulation: Policy2Constraint will enable researchers to directly operationalize regulatory principles, fostering new work on tension analysis between norms (e.g., privacy vs. fairness).  
  • Industrial Adoption: By reducing manual overhead, ML teams can accelerate compliance audits, reduce legal risk, and build public trust.  
  • Policy Feedback: Quantitative trade‐off analyses can inform regulators about the practical implications of policy design.  
  • Extensibility: The framework can incorporate future regulations (e.g., AGI safety frameworks) with minimal human intervention.  

Broader Societal Impact  
With automated compliance pipelines in place, organizations are less likely to commit privacy breaches, discriminatory decisions, or opaque model behaviors. This contributes to:  
  • Enhanced individual rights (e.g., right to explanation, right to be forgotten).  
  • More equitable access to automated decision‐making.  
  • Informed, data‐driven policy revisions.  

Conclusion  
Policy2Constraint addresses a critical gap at the intersection of ML and regulation by delivering an automated, scalable pipeline from legal text to model training. With rigorous evaluation on real‐world case studies and a community‐centered open‐source release, this research will catalyze the development of truly regulatable ML systems.
