**1. Title: Policy2Constraint: Automated Translation of Regulatory Text into Verifiable Machine Learning Constraints**

**2. Introduction**

**Background:** Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly integrated into critical societal domains, including finance, healthcare, employment, and criminal justice. This pervasive deployment brings significant benefits but also raises profound ethical and legal concerns regarding fairness, privacy, transparency, and accountability (Mittal et al., 2023; Petersen et al., 2022). Recognizing these risks, governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are enacting policies like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the upcoming AI Act, Canada's Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA), and various US state-level regulations (e.g., CCPA/CPRA). These regulations aim to establish safeguards, enforce rights (such as the right to explanation, privacy, and non-discrimination), and ensure that ML systems are developed and deployed responsibly.

However, a significant gap exists between the high-level principles articulated in these legal and regulatory texts and their concrete implementation within ML pipelines (Marino et al., 2025). Translating abstract legal requirements (e.g., "ensure fairness," "process data lawfully," "provide meaningful explanations") into specific, verifiable, and computationally tractable constraints for ML model training is a highly challenging task. Current approaches often rely on manual interpretation and encoding by legal experts and ML engineers, a process that is labor-intensive, prone to misinterpretation, difficult to scale across numerous and evolving regulations, and hard to audit systematically (Hassani et al., 2024). This gap hinders the development of demonstrably compliant ML systems and creates significant legal and reputational risks for organizations. The complexity is further amplified by potential tensions between different regulatory desiderata, such as the trade-offs often observed between accuracy, fairness, privacy, and interpretability.

**Problem Statement:** The core problem addressed by this research is the lack of automated, reliable, and scalable methods for translating regulatory requirements from natural language text into formal constraints that can be directly integrated into the ML model development lifecycle. Manually bridging this gap is inefficient and error-prone, failing to keep pace with the rapid evolution of both ML techniques and regulatory landscapes. Key challenges include: i) the inherent ambiguity and complexity of legal language requiring sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) tailored for the legal domain (Ershov, 2023); ii) the difficulty in mapping extracted legal norms into precise mathematical or logical formulations suitable for algorithmic use (Wang et al., 2024); iii) the technical challenge of incorporating these formal constraints effectively into ML optimization processes without unduly compromising model performance (Shaikh et al., 2017); and iv) ensuring the resulting system is verifiable and auditable.

**Proposed Solution:** We propose "Policy2Constraint," a novel framework designed to automate the end-to-end process of embedding regulatory compliance into ML models. This framework comprises three interconnected stages:
    1.  **Regulatory NLP:** Utilizing advanced NLP techniques, potentially leveraging pre-trained legal language models (like LegiLM [Zhu et al., 2024]) fine-tuned on specific regulatory corpora, this stage extracts key entities (e.g., data subjects, protected attributes, processing activities), rights, obligations, prohibitions, and their associated conditions directly from regulatory texts.
    2.  **Formalization & Constraint Generation:** The structured information extracted by the NLP module is then mapped onto a formal representation, potentially using intermediate representations like knowledge graphs (Ershov, 2023) or directly into first-order logic predicates. These formal statements are subsequently translated into differentiable (or approximately differentiable) penalty functions or constraints applicable to ML models.
    3.  **Constrained ML Optimization:** These generated penalty functions are integrated as soft or hard constraints into the objective function of standard ML training algorithms. We will explore multi-objective optimization techniques to navigate the trade-offs between task performance (e.g., prediction accuracy) and the satisfaction of multiple regulatory constraints.

**Research Objectives:**
*   **O1:** Develop and evaluate advanced NLP models specifically tailored for extracting regulatory requirements (rights, obligations, prohibitions, conditions) from legal texts (e.g., GDPR, AI Act, fair lending laws).
*   **O2:** Design and implement a systematic methodology for translating extracted NLP outputs into formal logic predicates and subsequently into differentiable penalty functions suitable for ML optimization.
*   **O3:** Develop and adapt constrained optimization algorithms capable of integrating these regulatory penalty functions into the training process of various ML models, effectively balancing task performance and compliance.
*   **O4:** Empirically validate the Policy2Constraint framework on realistic case studies (e.g., fair credit scoring, GDPR-compliant recommender systems), measuring both model performance and the degree of regulatory adherence achieved.
*   **O5:** Produce an open-source toolkit implementing the Policy2Constraint pipeline and provide guidelines for its application, facilitating wider adoption and research.

**Significance:** This research directly addresses the critical challenge of operationalizing regulatory principles in ML, a key focus of the Workshop on Regulatable ML. By automating the translation process, Policy2Constraint promises to:
*   Enhance the scalability and efficiency of developing compliant ML systems.
*   Reduce the risk of human error in interpreting and implementing complex regulations.
*   Provide a systematic and verifiable approach to demonstrating regulatory compliance.
*   Lower the barrier for organizations, especially smaller ones, to adopt responsible AI practices.
*   Contribute novel techniques at the intersection of NLP, formal methods, and constrained optimization for trustworthy ML.
*   Offer empirical insights into the inherent trade-offs between different regulatory goals and model performance.

**3. Methodology**

Our proposed methodology follows the three-stage Policy2Constraint framework: Regulatory NLP, Formalization & Constraint Generation, and Constrained ML Optimization. We will complement this core pipeline development with rigorous experimental validation.

**3.1. Stage 1: Regulatory NLP (Requirement Extraction)**

*   **Data Collection and Preparation:** We will curate a corpus of relevant regulatory documents, focusing initially on key regulations like GDPR (especially articles related to data subject rights, lawful processing, data minimization), the draft EU AI Act (focusing on requirements for high-risk systems, non-discrimination, data governance), and specific sectoral regulations like US fair lending laws (e.g., Equal Credit Opportunity Act - ECOA) or fair housing laws. Texts will be segmented, cleaned, and potentially annotated (manually or semi-automatically) to create training and evaluation data for NLP models. We will leverage existing legal text datasets where available and potentially collaborate with legal experts for annotation validation.
*   **NLP Techniques:** We plan to employ a combination of state-of-the-art NLP techniques:
    *   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Fine-tune transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, or specialized legal models like LegiLM [Zhu et al., 2024]) to identify key legal entities such as 'personal data', 'data subject', 'controller', 'processor', 'sensitive attributes', 'automated decision-making system', 'high-risk AI system', etc.
    *   **Relation Extraction and Semantic Parsing:** Develop models to identify relationships between entities and extract predicate-argument structures representing rights, obligations, prohibitions, and conditions. For example, identifying structures like `Obligation(Controller, 'obtain consent', DataSubject, Condition('before processing personal data'))` or `Prohibition(Model, 'discriminate based on', SensitiveAttribute)`. Techniques may include sequence-to-sequence models, graph neural networks operating on dependency parses, or instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) prompted for structured output (Hassani et al., 2024). We will explore leveraging legal ontologies to guide the extraction process.
*   **Output:** The output of this stage will be a structured, machine-readable representation of the regulatory requirements extracted from the text. This could be a set of logical predicates, attribute-value pairs, or entries in a knowledge graph (Ershov, 2023). For example, a GDPR requirement might be translated to: `Requirement(ID=GDPR_Art6_Consent, Type=Obligation, Actor=Controller, Action=ObtainConsent, Target=DataSubject, Condition=BeforeProcessing)`.

**3.2. Stage 2: Formalization & Constraint Generation**

*   **Mapping to Formal Logic:** The structured NLP output will be systematically mapped into a formal logical representation, likely First-Order Logic (FOL) or a decidable fragment thereof. Predicates will be defined to capture essential regulatory concepts (e.g., `IsPersonalData(d)`, `HasConsent(s, d, p)`, `IsProtectedGroup(g)`, `ModelOutput(m, x)`, `IsFair_DP(m, G)`, `ProcessingPurpose(p)`). The extracted requirements will be translated into logical formulae using these predicates. For instance, the example above might become $\forall s, d, p: \text{RequiresConsent}(d, p) \land \text{Processes}(c, s, d, p) \implies \text{HasConsent}(s, d, p)$. A fairness requirement like "non-discrimination based on race" could be formalized as related to model predictions $f(x)$ for inputs $x$ with sensitive attribute $A$: potentially targeting statistical parity, $\forall a_1, a_2 \in \text{Values}(A) : P(f(x)=1 | A=a_1) \approx P(f(x)=1 | A=a_2)$.
*   **Translation to Differentiable Penalties:** This is a crucial step. We will translate the logical formulae into continuous, differentiable (or sub-differentiable) penalty functions $P_i(\theta)$ that quantify the degree of violation of the $i$-th requirement by an ML model with parameters $\theta$.
    *   For statistical fairness constraints (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity), established fairness metrics can be directly used as penalties. For example, for demographic parity on a binary classification task ($\hat{y}$) with sensitive attribute $G$:
        $$ P_{DP}(\theta) = | E_{x \sim D|G=g_1}[\hat{y}(x;\theta)] - E_{x \sim D|G=g_2}[\hat{y}(x;\theta)] | $$
        where $E[\cdot]$ denotes expectation over the data distribution $D$. In practice, this is computed over a batch or dataset.
    *   For constraints related to data usage (e.g., data minimization, purpose limitation), we might formulate penalties based on feature usage, input gradients, or attention weights within the model, penalizing reliance on features deemed unnecessary or prohibited for a given purpose. For example, a penalty could enforce low input gradients w.r.t. features $X_{forbidden}$: $P_{Usage}(\theta) = \sum_{j \in X_{forbidden}} || \nabla_{x_j} f(x; \theta) ||^2$.
    *   For rights like the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF), penalties could be related to the influence of specific data points on the model, potentially measurable using influence functions or proxies targeted by machine unlearning techniques (Marino et al., 2025).
    *   Challenges with non-differentiability or complex logical structures will be addressed using techniques like relaxation, smoothed approximations (e.g., using sigmoid functions for indicator functions), or surrogate functions, drawing inspiration from areas like differentiable logic programming and frameworks like ACT (Wang et al., 2024).
*   **Output:** A library of penalty functions $\{P_1(\theta), ..., P_k(\theta)\}$, each corresponding to a specific regulatory constraint identified in Stage 1 and mapped in Stage 2.

**3.3. Stage 3: Constrained ML Optimization**

*   **Objective Formulation:** The final training objective will combine the standard task-specific loss $L_{task}(\theta)$ (e.g., cross-entropy for classification, mean squared error for regression) with the generated regulatory penalty functions:
    $$ L_{total}(\theta) = L_{task}(\theta) + \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i P_i(\theta) $$
    Here, $\lambda_i \ge 0$ are hyperparameters that control the trade-off between task performance and satisfying the $i$-th regulatory constraint. Setting appropriate values for $\lambda_i$ is critical and may involve domain expertise or automated hyperparameter optimization techniques.
*   **Optimization Algorithms:** We will start with standard gradient-based optimizers (SGD, Adam). However, given that multiple constraints might conflict with each other or with the task objective, we will investigate more advanced multi-objective optimization techniques. Potential methods include:
    *   **Weighted Sum:** The basic approach described above. Needs careful tuning of $\lambda_i$.
    *   **Constraint-Based Optimization:** Treat some penalties as hard constraints (e.g., using Lagrangian multipliers, projected gradient descent, or interior-point methods if feasible).
    *   **Pareto Optimization Methods:** Algorithms like Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) or methods based on finding Pareto fronts (e.g., using evolutionary algorithms or gradient manipulation techniques like gradient surgery) to explore the trade-off surface explicitly.
*   **Output:** A trained ML model $\theta^*$ that represents a desirable balance between achieving the primary task objective and adhering to the specified regulatory constraints encoded in the penalty functions.

**3.4. Experimental Design and Validation**

*   **Case Studies:** We will select 2-3 specific case studies to validate the framework:
    1.  **Fair Credit Scoring:** Using datasets like German Credit, COMPAS, or FICO Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Regulations: ECOA, potentially aspects of the EU AI Act regarding non-discrimination. Constraints will focus on fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds) automatically derived from anti-discrimination clauses. (Ref: Rida, 2024; Shaikh et al., 2017).
    2.  **GDPR-Compliant Recommender System:** Using datasets like MovieLens or synthetic data. Regulations: GDPR articles on consent, purpose limitation, data minimization, potentially RTBF. Constraints might penalize using certain user attributes without explicit flags for consent, limit the scope of data used for recommendations, or facilitate approximate data point removal/unlearning. (Ref: Marino et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2024).
*   **Datasets:** We will use publicly available datasets relevant to the case studies and potentially generate semi-synthetic data where necessary (e.g., to simulate consent flags or RTBF requests). Data preprocessing will include identifying sensitive attributes and relevant metadata for constraint evaluation.
*   **Baselines:** The performance of models trained using Policy2Constraint will be compared against:
    *   Unconstrained models (standard training).
    *   Models trained with manually implemented constraints (if feasible and representative of current practices).
    *   Alternative methods for achieving compliance (e.g., post-processing adjustments for fairness).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Task Performance:** Standard metrics relevant to the task (e.g., Accuracy, AUC, F1-Score for classification; Precision/Recall@K, NDCG for recommendations).
    *   **Constraint Satisfaction:** Quantify the violation level of each targeted regulatory constraint $P_i(\theta^*)$ using the generated penalty functions evaluated on a held-out test set. We will also define interpretable metrics corresponding to the constraints (e.g., difference in acceptance rates between groups for fairness, percentage of data points used violating a purpose limitation rule).
    *   **Overall Compliance Score:** Potentially develop a composite score based on the satisfaction levels of multiple constraints, weighted by regulatory importance.
    *   **Computational Cost:** Training time and resource usage compared to baselines.
*   **Analysis:** We will analyze the trade-offs between task performance and constraint satisfaction, potentially visualizing Pareto fronts. Ablation studies will be conducted to evaluate the contribution of each stage of the Policy2Constraint framework. We will assess the robustness of the approach to variations in regulatory text phrasing and complexity. Statistical tests will be used to determine the significance of observed differences.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

This research is expected to produce several key outcomes:

*   **A Novel Framework (Policy2Constraint):** A comprehensive, theoretically grounded, and empirically validated methodology for automating the translation of regulatory text into ML constraints.
*   **An Open-Source Toolkit:** A publicly available software library implementing the Policy2Constraint pipeline, including modules for legal NLP, constraint generation, and constrained optimization. This will enable other researchers and practitioners to build upon our work and apply it to new domains and regulations.
*   **Benchmark Results and Case Studies:** Empirical validation on realistic ML tasks (credit scoring, recommendations), providing concrete evidence of the framework's effectiveness, limitations, and the performance-compliance trade-offs involved. This will include validated sets of penalty functions for common regulatory principles like fairness and data minimization derived from specific legal texts.
*   **Guidelines and Best Practices:** Recommendations for applying the Policy2Constraint framework, including insights on tuning hyperparameters ($\lambda_i$), handling ambiguity in legal text, and interpreting the results of constrained training.
*   **Academic Publications:** Contributions to leading ML, NLP, and AI & Society conferences and journals, advancing the state-of-the-art in regulatable ML.

**Impact:** The successful completion of this project will have significant impact:

*   **For ML Researchers and Practitioners:** Provide a powerful toolset and methodology to proactively incorporate regulatory compliance into the ML development lifecycle, moving beyond post-hoc audits towards "compliance-by-design."
*   **For Industry:** Reduce the cost, complexity, and risk associated with ensuring ML systems comply with regulations. Enable faster deployment of trustworthy AI systems, fostering innovation within regulatory boundaries.
*   **For Regulators and Auditors:** Offer a potential pathway towards more automated and verifiable compliance checks, improving the effectiveness of regulatory oversight. The framework could help identify potential conflicts or ambiguities *within* or *between* regulations when translated into computational terms.
*   **For Society:** Increase trustworthiness and accountability of AI systems by making regulatory compliance more systematic and transparent. Contribute to the development of AI that aligns better with societal values and legal norms, ultimately fostering responsible AI adoption.

By bridging the critical gap between regulatory text and ML implementation, the Policy2Constraint project aims to make substantial contribution towards building a future where AI systems are not only powerful but also provably aligned with our legal and ethical frameworks. This aligns directly with the goals of the Workshop on Regulatable ML, fostering research that translates regulatory principles into algorithmic reality.
