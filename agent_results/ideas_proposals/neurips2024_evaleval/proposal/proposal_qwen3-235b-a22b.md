# **CoEval – A Collaborative Multi-Stakeholder Framework for Assessing Generative AI’s Societal Impact**

---

## **1. Introduction**

### **Background**
Generative AI (GenAI) systems—ranging from text-to-image diffusion models to speech synthesis systems—have demonstrated transformative capabilities across industries, yet their societal impacts remain poorly understood. Unlike traditional machine learning systems, GenAI outputs are unbounded, dynamic, and context-sensitive, amplifying risks such as misinformation propagation, intellectual property disputes, labor displacement, and entrenchment of systemic biases (Solaiman et al., 2023). While NeurIPS’ Broader Impact requirements have spurred initial reflections, technical evaluations often lack standardized protocols, exclude non-technical stakeholders, and reduce complex societal dimensions to simplistic benchmarks (Chouldechova et al., 2024). Existing frameworks like PARTICIP-AI (Mun et al., 2024) highlight the value of layperson participation in identifying AI harms, but they focus narrowly on speculative harms rather than structured evaluation workflows.

### **Research Objectives**
This project aims to address three gaps:
1. **Ad Hoc Protocols**: Current evaluations are fragmented and lack reproducibility.
2. **Expert-Centric Processes**: Developers and ML researchers dominate impact assessments, marginalizing domain experts, end-users, and policymakers.
3. **Limited Metric Validity**: Computational metrics (e.g., bias detection) often fail to capture multifaceted societal effects.

CoEval proposes a three-phase, open-source framework to operationalize participatory evaluation in GenAI systems:
- **Co-Design Workshops**: Integrate diverse perspectives into defining impact criteria.
- **Mixed-Methods Toolkit**: Combine qualitative (surveys/focus groups) and quantitative (computational metrics) approaches.
- **Living Repository & Policy Templates**: Standardize protocols and democratize policy guidance.

### **Significance**
By institutionalizing stakeholder collaboration, CoEval will:
- Mitigate harms overlooked by technical experts (e.g., psychological impacts of AI-generated content).
- Align AI systems with societal values through policy-informed feedback loops (Parthasarathy et al., 2024).
- Establish a reproducible evaluation paradigm, bridging measurement theory from social sciences (Chouldechova et al., 2024) with AI development.

This work responds to urgent calls for accountability, particularly in domains like healthcare, education, and creative labor, where GenAI adoption is accelerating but governance lags.

## **2. Methodology**

### **2.1 Phase 1: Co-Design Workshops**
#### **Objective**
To co-create context-specific evaluation criteria by engaging stakeholders (developers, users, policymakers, domain experts) in structured facilitation.

#### **Design**
1. **Stakeholder Recruitment**:
   - Partner with civil society organizations, industry consortia, and academic networks to recruit 30–50 participants per domain (text, vision, audio).
   - Target marginalized communities disproportionately affected by AI harms (e.g., gig workers, low-literacy populations).

2. **Card-Sorting Sessions**:
   - **Procedure**: 
     - Use participatory card-sorting (adapted from Nielsen et al.): Stakeholders categorize AI risks/benefits using domain-specific cards (e.g., bias, environmental cost, copyright infringement).
     - Cards are derived from: a) NeurIPS societal impact themes (fairness, safety, sustainability), and b) PARTICIP-AI’s harm categories.
   - **Prioritization**: Apply the **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)** to assign weights to criteria via pairwise comparisons (Saaty, 1980):
     $$
     w_j = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{a_{ij}}{\sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik}} \right)}{n}, 
     $$
     where $w_j$ is the weight of criterion $j$, and $a_{ij}$ represents the preference of stakeholder $i$.

3. **Consensus Metrics**:
   - **Consensus Score ($C$)**: Measure stakeholder alignment using inter-quartile range (IQR):
     $$
     C = 1 - \frac{\text{IQR}}{\text{Max}(IQR)},
     $$
     where $C \in [0,1]$ quantifies agreement across criteria.
   - **Output**: Context-specific impact rubrics for pilot domains (e.g., toxicity thresholds in text generation, cultural sensitivity in visual synthesis).

#### **Data Collection**
- Workshop transcripts, card-sorting artifacts (digital or physical), and real-time sentiment analysis via chatbots.
- Demographics, roles, and domain-specific feedback (anonymized to protect privacy).

---

### **2.2 Phase 2: Mixed-Methods Toolkit**
#### **Objective**
To operationalize criteria from Phase 1 into a modular evaluation toolkit, combining qualitative and computational metrics.

#### **Components**
1. **Survey Instruments**:
   - Build Likert-scale surveys grounded in social science questionnaires (e.g., WHOQoL for quality-of-life impacts).
   - Validate against domain-specific rubrics using **Cronbach’s α**:
     $$
     \alpha = \frac{n}{n-1} \left(1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_j^2}{\sigma_t^2} \right),
     $$
     where $n$ is the number of survey items, $\sigma_j^2$ the variance of individual items, and $\sigma_t^2$ total variance.

2. **Focus-Group Protocols**:
   - Semi-structured interviews to surface unintended consequences (e.g., labor displacement in AI art tools).
   - Thematic analysis via **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for qualitative coding, with **Krippendorff’s α** for inter-coder agreement:
     $$
     \alpha = 1 - \frac{\text{Observed disagreement}}{\text{Expected disagreement}}.
     $$

3. **Scenario Simulations**:
   - Create synthetic data for edge cases (e.g., generating hate speech from a text model, biometric data leakage in voice synthesis).
   - Use perturbation experiments to measure **bias amplification ($BA$)** via KL divergence:
     $$
     BA = D_{KL}\left(P_{\text{output}} \parallel P_{\text{input}}\right) = \sum_{x} P_{\text{output}}(x) \log \left( \frac{P_{\text{output}}(x)}{P_{\text{input}}(x)} \right).
     $$

4. **Computational Metrics**:
   - **Media-Specific Tools**:
     - Text: Toxicity, hallucination, and copyright infringement via contrastive decoding (Gehrmann et al., 2022).
     - Vision: Cultural bias using CLIP-based embeddings and subgroup fairness (Zhao et al., 2019).
     - Audio: Anonymization leaks via speaker recognition models (Nagrani et al., 2020).
   - **Aggregate Reporting**: Combine qualitative and quantitative outputs into a **Societal Impact Index ($SII$)**:
     $$
     SII = \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{w_j \cdot \left(\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m m_{ij}\right)}{\max(SII)},
     $$
     where $w_j$ are criteria weights from Phase 1, $m_{ij}$ are metric values (normalized), $k$ = number of criteria, $m$ = data points.

---

### **2.3 Phase 3: Living Repository & Policy Templates**
#### **Objective**
To archive evaluation protocols and distill policy recommendations that adapt to evolving GenAI use cases.

#### **Design**
1. **Public Platform Development**:
   - Host protocols, anonymized pilot datasets, and code on GitHub with version control.
   - Use **Semantic Scholar** integration to tag outputs with MeSH terms for interdisciplinary discoverability.

2. **Policy Template Generation**:
   - Synthesize recommendations from Phase 2 qualitative/focus-group data.
   - Apply natural language generation (NLG) to create model-specific briefs (e.g., “AI Art Generators and Labor Equity”).

3. **Community Feedback Loops**:
   - Deploy an **Open Review System**:
     - Allow external researchers to validate metrics using their own datasets.
     - Update criteria weights via **Bayesian hierarchical modeling** as new data arrives:
       $$
       w_j^{(t)} = \frac{\alpha_j + n_j^{(t-1)}}{\beta + \sum_{j'=1}^k n_{j'}^{(t-1)}} \cdot w_j^{(t-1)},
       $$
       where $\alpha_j$ and $\beta$ are Dirichlet priors, and $n_j^{(t-1)}$ are previous observations.

### **2.4 Experimental Validation**
#### **Pilot Domains**
Evaluate CoEval across three GenAI modalities:
- **Text**: News article summarization systems (e.g., GPT-4o).
- **Vision**: Synthetic image generation for advertising (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
- **Audio**: Voice cloning for virtual assistants (e.g., Amazon Polly).

#### **Iterative Refinement**
- Three cycles of feedback:
  1. **Baseline Evaluation**: Apply rubrics without stakeholder input.
  2. **CoEval Pilot**: Execute Phases 1–2 with diverse stakeholders.
  3. **Validation Against Baseline**: Measure deviation in metrics (e.g., $\Delta BA$) and stakeholder satisfaction.

#### **Evaluation Metrics**
1. **Stakeholder Engagement**:
   - **Participation Index ($PI$)**: Log diversity (via Shannon entropy) and session attendance:
     $$
     PI = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \left(1 + H(\text{stakeholder categories})\right)}{n}, 
     $$
     where $H$ measures entropy over categories (age, gender, expertise).

2. **Metric Validity**:
   - **Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR)**: For qualitative data (α ≥ 0.8 acceptable).
   - **Convergent Validity**: Correlation between qualitative rubrics and computational metrics ($r \geq 0.6$).

3. **Scalability**:
   - **Adoption Rate ($AR$)**: Proportion of external teams using CoEval within 6 months of publication.
   - **Feedback Latency ($L$)**: Time to refine metrics via the living repository (target $L \leq 30$ days).

4. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - **Pre vs. Post CoEval**: Paired t-tests ($t$) for metrics like $SII$ and $BA$.
   - **Cost-Effectiveness**: Measure hours saved in impact assessments versus traditional methods.
