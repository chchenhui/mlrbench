# Concept Mapping for Black-Box Model Interpretability

## Motivation
As machine learning models become increasingly complex, understanding their internal decision-making processes remains a critical challenge. Current interpretability methods often fail to connect model behavior to human-understandable concepts, making it difficult to predict biases, ensure safety, or improve models systematically. This research addresses the gap between mechanistic interpretability (focused on neuron-level analysis) and concept-based interpretability (focused on human-understandable ideas), providing a bridge that enables more effective model attribution.

## Main Idea
We propose a framework that automatically identifies and maps latent concepts within trained models by combining activation clustering techniques with concept attribution methods. The approach uses unsupervised learning to group activation patterns across network layers, then correlates these clusters with human-interpretable concepts using a curated concept dataset. By tracking how these concept representations transform through the network, we can attribute model behaviors to specific concept combinations. The framework includes a visualization tool that shows concept activation paths for any given input, revealing which concepts influence predictions most strongly. This enables practitioners to identify problematic concept associations, locate the network regions responsible for specific biases, and potentially perform targeted interventions without retraining entire models. The approach scales to large models while providing actionable insights about their internal representations.
