1. **Title**: Federated Differentially Private Synthetic Data Generation for Collaborative Learning  
2. **Motivation**: Accessing sensitive data across organizations (e.g., healthcare, finance) is hindered by privacy, legal, and ethical barriers. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training models without sharing raw data, but gradients or model updates can still leak sensitive information. Synthetic data generation offers a promising alternative, but existing methods often lack rigorous privacy guarantees or fail to capture cross-client data diversity. This work addresses the critical need for a collaborative framework that ensures privacy, fairness, and utility in data access while enabling large-scale model training.  
3. **Main Idea**: We propose a novel FL framework where clients train **differentially private (DP) generative models** (e.g., GANs, VAEs) on their local data. The server aggregates these DP models to create a **global synthetic dataset** that preserves statistical properties of the original data while providing formal privacy guarantees. Key innovations include: (1) integrating DP mechanisms into federated generative model training to prevent leakage of individual data points, and (2) leveraging cross-client diversity to enhance synthetic data quality. The synthetic dataset is then used to train downstream models, eliminating the need for direct data sharing. We will evaluate the framework on healthcare and financial datasets, measuring privacy-utility trade-offs, fairness metrics, and model performance against real-data baselines. This approach could redefine secure data access, enabling collaborative AI development in regulated domains.
