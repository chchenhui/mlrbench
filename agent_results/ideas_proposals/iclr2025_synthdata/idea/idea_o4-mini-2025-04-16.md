Title: FairFlow: Fairness-Guided Normalizing Flows for Synthetic Data Generation

Motivation:  
Synthetic data can alleviate data‐access, privacy, and IP concerns, but often perpetuates historical biases and yields unfair downstream predictions. Embedding explicit fairness controls into generative models is critical for producing equitable datasets in sensitive domains (e.g., healthcare, finance).

Main Idea:  
We propose a normalizing flow framework augmented with a fairness critic that measures distributional disparities across protected groups. Training jointly minimizes the negative log-likelihood and a fairness loss term, weighted by a dynamically adjusted Lagrangian multiplier to achieve fine-grained parity control. To guarantee privacy, we incorporate DP-SGD on flow parameters, providing (ϵ,δ)-differential privacy. We will benchmark FairFlow on real-world datasets (MIMIC-III, loan approval) against existing syntheses, evaluating:  
• Utility: distributional fidelity, downstream model accuracy  
• Fairness: demographic parity, equalized odds  
• Privacy leakage metrics  
Expected outcomes include a deployable toolkit allowing practitioners to balance utility, fairness, and privacy in synthetic data generation, thereby advancing responsible, accessible ML.
