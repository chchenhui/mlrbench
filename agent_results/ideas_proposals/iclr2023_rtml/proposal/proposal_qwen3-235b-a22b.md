# Scalable Machine Unlearning via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models  

## Introduction  

### Background  
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse applications, from natural language understanding to code generation. However, their reliance on vast amounts of training data increases the risk of memorizing sensitive, toxic, or biased content. Such memorization raises ethical, legal, and security concerns, especially when deploying LLMs in mission-critical domains like healthcare, education, and law. For instance, LLMs may unintentionally leak sensitive personal information during inference or amplify biases against marginalized communities. Traditional solutions like retraining from scratch to excise problematic data are computationally prohibitive due to the scale of modern LLMs (e.g., models with billions of parameters). Existing machine unlearning methods—proposed to remove data influences without retraining—often struggle with scalability, precision, and formal guarantees.  

Machine unlearning seeks to guarantee that a model behaves *as if* it had trained on the dataset excluding specific subsets (e.g., private data). While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and adapters have enabled efficient downstream adaptation of LLMs, their integration with unlearning remains underexplored. Gradient-based influence estimation offers a promising pathway to identify data-specific parameters, but scaling this to LLMs requires novel architectural and algorithmic designs.  

### Research Objectives  
This research aims to develop a scalable, precise, and theoretically grounded framework for machine unlearning in LLMs by combining PEFT and gradient-based influence estimation. The objectives are:  
1. **Scalable Unlearning via PEFT**: Integrate PEFT modules (e.g., LoRA) to isolate data-specific influences in LLMs, enabling modular removal without retraining the entire model.  
2. **Gradient-Driven Influence Identification**: Use gradient tracing to pinpoint parameters most affected by target data (e.g., toxic samples), ensuring precise unlearning.  
3. **Formal Privacy Guarantees**: Analyze whether the method satisfies differential unlearning bounds, providing compliance with regulations like GDPR.  
4. **Utility Preservation**: Maintain model performance on non-target data through lightweight fine-tuning on a purified dataset.  
5. **Benchmarking**: Create a standardized evaluation suite to compare unlearning efficacy, computational efficiency, and bias mitigation.  

### Significance  
The proposed framework addresses critical gaps in trustworthy AI:  
1. **Ethical Compliance**: Enables organizations to comply with data deletion laws by efficiently purging unwanted information (e.g., copyrighted material or private user data).  
2. **Cost Reduction**: Achieves unlearning with <5% computational overhead compared to retraining, making it feasible for industry-scale LLMs.  
3. **Bias and Toxicity Mitigation**: Offers a targeted mechanism to reduce harmful outputs in high-stakes applications, such as hiring or criminal justice systems.  
4. **Foundational Research**: Advances theoretical understanding of machine unlearning for non-convex models, bridging gaps between empirical techniques and formal guarantees.  
5. **Tooling**: Delivers a publicly available toolkit for auditing and refining LLMs post-deployment, enhancing trust in deployed systems.  

## Methodology  

### Overview  
The framework operates on three core principles:  
1. **Gradient-Driven Influence Analysis**: Identify parameters strongly influenced by target data.  
2. **Modular Parameterization**: Encapsulate data-specific influences into PEFT modules (e.g., LoRA) while freezing core model weights.  
3. **Selective Unlearning**: Remove PEFT modules associated with target data and fine-tune on clean data to preserve utility.  

### Technical Details  

#### 1. Gradient-Based Influence Estimation  
Let $ f_\theta(x) $ denote a pre-trained LLM with parameters $ \theta $. For a target dataset $ D_{\text{bad}} \subset D_{\text{train}} $, we estimate the influence of $ D_{\text{bad}} $ on $ \theta $ via gradient tracing:  
$$
\mathcal{I}(\theta, D_{\text{bad}}) = \sum_{i \in D_{\text{bad}}} \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(f_\theta(x_i), y_i),
$$
where $ \mathcal{L} $ is the loss function. Parameters with high $ \|\mathcal{I}(\theta, D_{\text{bad}})\| $ are prioritized for unlearning. To scale this to LLMs, we approximate influence using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) in gradient space, as in SalUn \cite{SalUn}.  

#### 2. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA  
We decompose $ \theta $ into core weights $ \theta_{\text{core}} $ (frozen) and PEFT modules $ \theta_{\text{LoRA}} $. In LoRA, low-rank matrices $ \Delta W = B \cdot A $ are injected into attention layers, where $ B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d} $ and $ A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k} $. Targeted influences are isolated into $ \theta_{\text{LoRA}} $, allowing modular removal.  

#### 3. Selective Unlearning Algorithm  
**Steps**:  
1. **Data Partitioning**: Split $ D_{\text{train}} $ into clean data $ D_{\text{clean}} = D_{\text{train}} \setminus D_{\text{bad}} $.  
2. **Influence-Aware PEFT**: Train $ \theta_{\text{LoRA}} $ on $ D_{\text{train}} $, ensuring gradients from $ D_{\text{bad}} $ dominate $ \theta_{\text{LoRA}} $.  
3. **Module Removal**: Erase $ \theta_{\text{LoRA}} $ associated with $ D_{\text{bad}} $, yielding a partially "unlearned" model $ f_{\theta_{\text{core}}} $.  
4. **Utility Restoration**: Fine-tune $ \theta_{\text{core}} $ on $ D_{\text{clean}} $ with fresh PEFT modules to recover lost knowledge.  

**Pseudocode**:  
```python  
def unlearn(model, D_train, D_bad):  
    D_clean = D_train - D_bad  
    # Step 1: Pre-train PEFT modules  
    theta_LoRA = train_LoRA(model, D_train)  
    # Step 2: Estimate influence of D_bad on theta_LoRA  
    influence = gradient_trace(D_bad, theta_LoRA)  
    # Step 2: Remove modules with high influence  
    theta_LoRA_removed = remove_modules(theta_LoRA, influence > threshold)  
    # Step 3: Restore utility with clean data  
    theta_finetuned = fine_tune(model, D_clean)  
    return theta_finetuned  
```  

#### 4. Theoretical Guarantees  
Let $ \epsilon $-differential unlearning guarantee that the model’s output distribution is $ \epsilon $-indistinguishable before and after unlearning for $ D_{\text{bad}} $. For non-convex models, we enforce $ \epsilon $-guarantees via:  
$$
\Pr[f_{\theta_{\text{unlearned}}}(x) \in S] \leq e^\epsilon \cdot \Pr[f_{\theta_{\text{retrained on }D_{\text{clean}}}}(x) \in S], \quad \forall S \subseteq \text{Outputs}.  
$$
By constraining unlearning to low-rank subspace $ \theta_{\text{LoRA}} $, we show that $ \epsilon $-bounds scale linearly with the rank $ r $, enabling tighter guarantees than full-model retraining.
