# Title: Adaptive Adversarial Unlearning for Bias Mitigation in Large Language Models

## Motivation
Large language models (LLMs) often perpetuate and amplify societal biases against marginalized groups. Current bias mitigation approaches are typically applied uniformly across models, failing to address the varying manifestations of bias across different demographic dimensions. Moreover, traditional debiasing methods can degrade model performance on unrelated tasks. A targeted, adaptive approach is urgently needed to selectively unlearn harmful biases while preserving the model's overall capabilities.

## Main Idea
We propose Adaptive Adversarial Unlearning (AAU), a novel framework that combines machine unlearning with adversarial training to selectively mitigate biases in LLMs. AAU works by first identifying bias-prone regions in the model's representation space using a collection of specialized bias probes for different demographic attributes (race, gender, sexuality, etc.). Then, it deploys targeted adversarial perturbations to these specific regions, forcing the model to unlearn biased associations while leaving other knowledge intact. The framework employs a multi-objective optimization approach that balances three competing goals: bias reduction, task performance preservation, and generalization to unseen contexts. By focusing unlearning efforts only on the most problematic parts of the model's knowledge, AAU achieves more effective bias mitigation while minimizing performance degradation on general tasksâ€”a crucial consideration for deploying trustworthy LLMs in real-world applications.
