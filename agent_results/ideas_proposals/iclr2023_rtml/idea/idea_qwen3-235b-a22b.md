**Title:** Causal Insight: Modular Interpretability for Robust Large-Scale AI  

**Motivation:**  
Large-scale models often act as "black boxes," complicating trust in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law. Post-hoc interpretability methods frequently fail to provide *faithful explanations*—especially under domain shifts or adversarial scenarios—reducing their utility for ensuring robustness, fairness, and accountability. Existing approaches also lack modularity, hindering fine-grained diagnosis of model decisions. This research addresses the urgent need for interpretable systems that remain reliable and explainable in dynamic, real-world conditions.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a modular architecture that embeds *disentangled, causal reasoning* into the model design itself, rather than retrofitting explanations. Each module focuses on interpretable feature groups (e.g., bias-sensitive attributes, domain-specific signals) and learns causal chains linking inputs to outputs. These modules are trained with a multi-objective loss balancing task performance, interpretability constraints (e.g., feature attribution sparsity), and robustness to distributional shifts. To enhance efficiency, we employ lightweight causal graphs to identify key decision drivers and prune non-essential components. We will benchmark the framework against vision and language tasks under simulated adversarial attacks and domain shifts, measuring explanation fidelity (vs. model behavior), robustness (accuracy under perturbation), and transparency audit scores.  

**Expected Impact:**  
This work could resolve critical gaps in trustworthiness by enabling models that "explain as they infer," ensuring alignment with ethical standards without sacrificing scalability. Applications in medical AI and legal analytics would benefit from verifiable, modular diagnostics, directly addressing privacy, fairness, and robustness concerns raised in the task. The modular-causal framework’s extensibility also offers a unified blueprint for future trustworthy AI design.
