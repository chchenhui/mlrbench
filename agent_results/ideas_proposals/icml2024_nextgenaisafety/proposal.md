Title: Dynamic Risk-Adaptive Filtering for Dangerous‐Capability Queries in Language Models

1. Introduction  
1.1 Background  
The rapid advance of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked unprecedented capabilities in text understanding and generation. At the same time, these models can inadvertently reveal instructions for malicious activities—ranging from bioweapon design to cyber‐attack planning—when prompted. Traditional safety measures rely on rigid keyword‐ or rule‐based blocking, which either over‐restricts benign research or under‐captures novel attack vectors. A more nuanced, context‐sensitive defense is needed—one that dynamically assesses risk and modulates the model’s responses to balance safety and utility.

1.2 Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop and evaluate a two‐stage “Risk‐Adaptive Filter” (RAF) for LLMs. Our core objectives are:  
• To design a continuous risk‐scoring classifier that labels user queries according to a fine‐grained threat taxonomy.  
• To implement a dynamic policy module that, based on the classifier’s output, either (a) allows standard completion, (b) returns a “safe completion” with high‐level guidance only, or (c) refuses with redirection to vetted expert resources.  
• To incorporate reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with risk‐aware objectives (e.g., CVaR constraints) for policy fine‐tuning.  
• To benchmark the system on a synthetic “DangerQA” dataset of benign, benign‐adversarial, and truly dangerous queries, measuring safety (false negatives), utility (user satisfaction), and adaptability to emerging threats.

1.3 Significance  
Our approach will surpass static blocking by:  
• Minimizing false positives—preserving legitimate research queries.  
• Reducing false negatives—preventing disallowed disclosures.  
• Adapting over time to novel threats via periodic retraining and RLHF updates.  
This work advances AI safety by offering a deployable, statistically sound filter that balances openness and protection in high‐stakes domains such as biosecurity and cybersecurity.

2. Methodology  
2.1 Overview  
We decompose the Risk‐Adaptive Filter into two modules:  
• Stage 1 (Risk Classifier): A supervised model that assigns each query $x$ a continuous risk score $r(x)\in[0,1]$.  
• Stage 2 (Policy Engine): A decision layer that maps $r(x)$ into one of three actions: $\{\text{Allow},\text{SafeComplete},\text{Refuse}\}$, where the policy is optimized via RLHF under risk‐aware constraints.

2.2 Dataset Construction  
2.2.1 Threat Taxonomy & Annotation  
We curate a taxonomy of dangerous‐capability topics:  
1. Bioweapon synthesis  
2. Malware and cyber‐attack methods  
3. Chemical weapon procedures  
4. Disinformation and social‐engineering campaigns  
5. Weapons‐related technical instructions  

For each category, we collect:  
• Benign queries (e.g., “What are the symptoms of influenza?”)  
• “Benign‐adversarial” queries containing overlapping keywords but innocuous intent (“How do I test influenza vaccines safely?”)  
• Truly dangerous queries (“Outline the steps to engineer a novel influenza strain.”)

A team of domain experts labels 10,000 queries with risk levels: low ($r<0.3$), medium ($0.3\le r<0.7$), high ($r\ge0.7$).

2.2.2 Adversarial Augmentation  
We generate 5,000 paraphrases and obfuscated formulations via prompt‐based adversarial attacks (e.g., synonym substitution, code‐switching) to challenge the classifier.

2.3 Stage 1: Risk Classifier  
2.3.1 Model Architecture  
We fine‐tune a pre‐trained Transformer encoder (e.g., RoBERTa‐large) to map a token sequence $x$ to a scalar risk score $r(x)$. Formally,  
$$
h = \mathrm{Encoder}(x),\quad
r(x) = \sigma(w^\top h + b)\,,
$$  
where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid activation.  

2.3.2 Loss Function  
We treat risk scoring as regression with targets in $[0,1]$. We combine mean‐squared error with a ranking loss to encourage proper ordering:  
$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \bigl(r_i - \hat r_i\bigr)^2
+ \lambda_{\mathrm{rank}}\frac{1}{|\mathcal{P}|}\sum_{(i,j)\in\mathcal{P}}\max\bigl(0,\,\hat r_j-\hat r_i+\delta\bigr),
$$  
where $\hat r_i$ is the predicted score, $r_i$ the ground truth, $\mathcal{P}=\{(i,j)\,|\,r_i>r_j\}$ are positive pairs, and $\delta>0$ a margin.

2.3.3 Training & Validation  
• Train on 80% of labeled data (12K queries), validate on 10% (1.5K), test on 10% (1.5K).  
• Metrics: Pearson correlation, mean absolute error (MAE), and classification accuracy when thresholded at $0.3$ and $0.7$.

2.4 Stage 2: Policy Engine  
2.4.1 Policy Representation  
We define a stochastic policy $\pi_\theta(a\,|\,r)$ over actions $a\in\{A,S,R\}$ conditioned on risk score $r$:  
$$
\pi_\theta(a\,|\,r) = \frac{\exp\bigl(f_\theta(a,r)\bigr)}{\sum_{a'}\exp\bigl(f_\theta(a',r)\bigr)}.
$$

2.4.2 Reward and Cost Models  
We follow the Safe RLHF paradigm (Dai et al., 2023), training separate neural models:  
• $R_\phi(x,a)$: reward estimate of user satisfaction (higher for more informative completions).  
• $C_\psi(x,a)$: cost estimate of safety violation (higher if dangerous details leak).  

2.4.3 Constrained Objective  
We formulate policy optimization as:  
$$
\max_\theta\;\mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mathcal{D},\,a\sim\pi_\theta(\cdot|r(x))}\bigl[R_\phi(x,a)\bigr]
\quad\text{s.t.}\quad
\mathbb{E}_{x,a}\bigl[C_\psi(x,a)\bigr]\le d,
$$  
where $d$ is a user‐specified cost budget. Introducing a Lagrange multiplier $\lambda\ge0$, we optimize the Lagrangian:  
$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta,\lambda) = \mathbb{E}[R_\phi] - \lambda\bigl(\mathbb{E}[C_\psi]-d\bigr).
$$

We update $(\theta,\lambda)$ by gradient ascent‐descent:  
\[
\theta\leftarrow\theta + \alpha_\theta\nabla_\theta\mathbb{E}_{x,a}[R_\phi - \lambda C_\psi],\quad
\lambda\leftarrow\lambda - \alpha_\lambda\bigl(\mathbb{E}[C_\psi]-d\bigr).
\]

2.4.4 Incorporating CVaR  
To guard against rare, high‐cost failures, we also integrate Conditional Value‐at‐Risk (CVaR) constraints (Chen et al., 2023). Let $Z_{x,a}=C_\psi(x,a)$ be the random cost. For risk level $\alpha\in(0,1)$,  
$$
\mathrm{CVaR}_\alpha(Z) = \inf_{\nu}\Big\{\nu + \tfrac{1}{1-\alpha}\mathbb{E}[(Z-\nu)_+]\Big\}.
$$  
We enforce $\mathrm{CVaR}_\alpha(Z)\le d_\alpha$ in addition to the expectation constraint, using samples of $(x,a)$ to approximate and backpropagate.

2.5 Full Pipeline  
Pseudocode for online filtering:  
```
Input: user query x
Compute r = RiskClassifier(x)
Sample a ~ πθ(a|r)
If a==Allow:
    return LLM.generate(x)
Else if a==SafeComplete:
    return SafeTemplate(LLM, x)
Else:  # Refuse
    return RefusalMessage + ExpertLinks
```
SafeTemplate(·) invokes the LLM with a prompt engineered to omit step‐by‐step instructions but provide high‐level guidance.

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
3.1 Anticipated Results  
We expect the Risk‐Adaptive Filter to achieve:  
• FNR < 1% on held‐out dangerous queries, significantly lower than static baselines.  
• FPR < 5% on benign queries, preserving utility for legitimate research.  
• Robustness to adversarial rephrasings, with <10% relative degradation.  
• Demonstrated trade‐off curves between safety and utility by varying $d$ and $\alpha$.

3.2 Broader Impacts  
The proposed system will:  
• Enable safer release of powerful LLMs by mitigating unintentional disclosures of malicious content.  
• Preserve open scientific inquiry by reducing unnecessary overblocking of benign research.  
• Provide a framework for continuous safety‐monitoring via RLHF and CVaR, extensible to other modalities (multimodal queries).  
• Inform policy guidelines and best practices for AI providers, emphasizing risk‐adaptive approaches over static rules.

3.3 Long‐Term Vision  
In the long term, we foresee integrating our Risk‐Adaptive Filter into production LLM stacks, continuously learning from real‐world usage to anticipate new threat vectors. Extensions include multi‐modal risk scoring (audio, video), user‐level customization of cost budgets (e.g., medical vs. public forums), and automated discovery of emerging risk patterns via unsupervised threat detection. This work lays the foundation for next‐generation AI safety mechanisms that are both principled and practical.
