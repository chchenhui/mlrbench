## 1. Title

Dynamic Risk-Adaptive Filtering for Dangerous-Capability Queries

## 2. Introduction

### Background

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about significant improvements in various domains, from healthcare to entertainment. However, this progress has also introduced new challenges, particularly in ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of AI systems. As AI agents become more autonomous and capable, they pose risks such as unintended consequences, ethical issues, and the potential for misuse. In the context of AI systems that can generate and disseminate diverse modalities like audio, video, and images, the risks of content appropriateness, privacy, bias, and misinformation become even more pronounced. Furthermore, personalized interactions and sensitive applications in high-risk domains such as legal, medical, and mental health require stringent safety measures to prevent overreliance on automation and catastrophic errors.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a dynamic, context-aware defense mechanism that can intercept user queries before generation, thereby mitigating the risk of AI systems inadvertently disclosing instructions for harmful applications. Specifically, the research aims to:

1. **Develop a two-stage "Risk-Adaptive Filter"**: This filter will intercept user queries and assign a continuous risk score based on a learned risk classifier.
2. **Enforce dynamic policies**: Depending on the risk score, the filter will either allow the query to proceed normally, trigger safe-completion templates, or refuse the query with redirection to verified expert resources.
3. **Fine-tune policies via reinforcement learning from human feedback**: The filter will be regularly updated based on human feedback to adapt to emerging threat patterns.
4. **Evaluate the effectiveness of the filter**: The performance of the filter will be assessed using simulated dangerous queries, measuring false-negative rates, user satisfaction, and overall utility.

### Significance

The significance of this research lies in its potential to balance the need for safe AI systems with the legitimate utility of AI capabilities. By developing a flexible, context-aware defense mechanism, this research aims to minimize the misuse potential of AI systems while preserving constructive research access. This is particularly important in high-risk domains where the stakes are high, and the potential for catastrophic errors is significant.

## 3. Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed methodology involves the development of a two-stage "Risk-Adaptive Filter" that intercepts user queries before generation. The filter consists of the following components:

1. **Risk Classifier**: A learned risk classifier that assigns a continuous risk score to each query.
2. **Dynamic Policy Enforcer**: A component that enforces policies based on the risk score assigned by the risk classifier.
3. **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: A mechanism for fine-tuning the filter's policies based on human feedback.

### Data Collection

The data collection process will involve the following steps:

1. **Curated Threat Taxonomy**: A comprehensive threat taxonomy will be developed to cover various harmful applications and technologies.
2. **Adversarial Examples**: A dataset of adversarial examples will be created to augment the threat taxonomy, ensuring the risk classifier can handle a wide range of potential threats.
3. **Simulated Queries**: A benchmark of simulated dangerous queries will be generated to evaluate the performance of the filter.

### Algorithmic Steps

#### Stage 1: Risk Classification

The risk classifier will be trained using a supervised learning approach. The training data will consist of the curated threat taxonomy and adversarial examples. The classifier will assign a continuous risk score to each query, with higher scores indicating higher risk.

Let \( x \) be the input query, and \( y \) be the output risk score. The risk classifier can be represented as:

\[ y = f(x; \theta) \]

where \( \theta \) are the parameters of the classifier.

#### Stage 2: Dynamic Policy Enforcement

Based on the risk score assigned by the risk classifier, the dynamic policy enforcer will decide the appropriate action:

1. **Low-Risk Queries**: Queries with a risk score below a certain threshold will proceed normally.
2. **Medium-Risk Queries**: Queries with a risk score between the low-risk and high-risk thresholds will trigger safe-completion templates that omit sensitive steps but offer high-level guidance.
3. **High-Risk Queries**: Queries with a risk score above the high-risk threshold will be refused with an optional redirection to verified expert resources.

The dynamic policy enforcer can be represented as:

\[ \text{action} = g(y; \theta) \]

where \( \theta \) are the parameters of the policy enforcer.

#### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback

The filter's policies will be fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback. Human feedback will be collected through a user interface that allows users to rate the appropriateness of the filter's responses. The feedback will be used to train a reward model that guides the optimization of the filter's policies.

Let \( r \) be the reward signal based on human feedback, and \( \pi \) be the policy to be optimized. The reinforcement learning algorithm can be represented as:

\[ \pi^* = \arg\max_\pi \mathbb{E}[R(\pi)] \]

where \( R(\pi) \) is the expected reward under policy \( \pi \).

### Experimental Design

The performance of the filter will be evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **False-Negative Rate**: The proportion of high-risk queries that are incorrectly classified as low-risk.
2. **User Satisfaction**: The satisfaction of users with the filter's responses, measured through a user survey.
3. **Overall Utility**: The overall utility of the filter in balancing safety and legitimate utility, measured through a combination of the false-negative rate and user satisfaction.

The evaluation will be conducted using the benchmark of simulated dangerous queries, with the filter's performance compared against baseline methods.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

The expected outcomes of this research include:

1. **Development of a Dynamic Risk-Adaptive Filter**: A two-stage filter that intercepts user queries and assigns risk scores, enforcing dynamic policies based on these scores.
2. **Fine-Tuned Policies via RLHF**: Policies that are fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback, adapting to emerging threat patterns.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: A set of evaluation metrics to measure the performance of the filter, including false-negative rates, user satisfaction, and overall utility.

### Impact

The impact of this research is expected to be significant in several ways:

1. **Improved AI Safety**: By developing a dynamic, context-aware defense mechanism, this research aims to minimize the misuse potential of AI systems while preserving constructive research access.
2. **Balanced Safety and Utility**: The filter will provide a framework for balancing the need for safe AI systems with the legitimate utility of AI capabilities.
3. **Adaptation to Emerging Threats**: The use of reinforcement learning from human feedback will enable the filter to adapt to new and evolving threats, ensuring that it remains effective over time.
4. **Transparency and Interpretability**: The filter's decision-making process will be transparent and interpretable, enhancing trust and safety.

## Conclusion

The proposed research aims to develop a dynamic, context-aware defense mechanism for AI systems that can intercept user queries before generation and mitigate the risk of dangerous disclosures. By combining risk classification, dynamic policy enforcement, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, this research seeks to balance safety and utility in AI systems. The expected outcomes and impact of this research are significant, with the potential to improve AI safety, balance safety and utility, adapt to emerging threats, and enhance transparency and interpretability in AI systems.
