# Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Graphs for Unified Scene Representation in Autonomous Driving

## Introduction

### Background  
Autonomous driving systems require robust scene understanding to enable safe navigation in dynamic environments. Modern pipelines typically decompose this challenge into modular components—perception (object detection, semantic segmentation), prediction (trajectory forecasting), and planning (route optimization)—leading to error propagation and inefficiencies due to disjoint representations [1, 3]. While graph-based approaches have emerged to model interactions among agents [4–10], static environmental elements (e.g., roads, lanes) are often decoupled from dynamic actors (vehicles, pedestrians), limiting the system’s ability to generalize across complex scenarios. Recent works like UniScene [1, 2] and VAD [3] highlight the importance of unified representations but still face limitations in capturing temporal dynamics and multimodal interactions.  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a hierarchical spatiotemporal graph (HSTG) that unifies static and dynamic elements in a shared geometric space. The key objectives are:  
1. **Design a graph structure** that jointly encodes infrastructure, vehicles, pedestrians, and environmental features using adaptive edge weights to model interactions.  
2. **Integrate multimodal sensor data** (LiDAR, camera, motion) into the graph framework for end-to-end learning.  
3. **Enable joint perception-prediction-planning** via dynamic graph neural networks and temporal convolutional networks (TCNs).  
4. **Enhance generalization** through self-supervised contrastive learning to reduce reliance on labeled datasets.  
5. **Validate safety-critical planning** by explicitly modeling actor interactions for robust decision-making.  

### Significance  
A unified scene representation addressing both static and dynamic elements could bridge the gap between modular and end-to-end autonomous systems. By explicitly modeling spatiotemporal interactions, this approach may improve accuracy in complex urban scenes, reduce computational overhead through shared representations, and enhance robustness to edge cases. The proposed methodology advances existing works like HDGT [4] and Trajectron++ [9] by introducing hierarchical temporal layers and contrastive learning, enabling better generalization across novel environments.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing  
The system will be trained and evaluated on large-scale autonomous driving datasets:  
- **NuScenes**: LiDAR, camera, and motion data with 1.4M annotated bounding boxes.  
- **Argoverse 2**: High-definition maps and 3D tracking annotations for trajectory prediction.  
- **KITTI Vision Benchmark**: For evaluating 3D object detection and semantic segmentation.  

**Preprocessing Steps**:  
1. **Sensor Fusion**: Calibrate LiDAR points ($ \mathcal{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 3} $) with camera images ($ \mathcal{C} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3} $) using extrinsic matrices.  
2. **Static Infrastructure Extraction**: Use semantic segmentation (e.g., nuScenes map annotations) to identify roads, lanes, and sidewalks.  
3. **Dynamic Actor Detection**: Apply 3D object detection (e.g., PointPillars [2]) to LiDAR data for dynamic agents.

### Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Graph Construction  

#### Node Representation  
Each node $ v_i \in \mathcal{V} $ encodes:  
- **Static Nodes**: Infrastructure geometry (position $ \mathbf{p}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3 $, semantic class $ s_i $).  
- **Dynamic Nodes**: Agent state (position $ \mathbf{p}_i $, velocity $ \mathbf{v}_i $, orientation $ \theta_i $, class $ s_i $).  

The feature vector for node $ i $ at time $ t $:  
$$
\mathbf{h}_i^{(t)} = \text{MLP}([\mathbf{p}_i, \mathbf{v}_i, \theta_i, s_i])
$$

#### Edge Definition  
Edges $ e_{ij} \in \mathcal{E} $ connect interacting nodes:  
1. **Spatial Edges**: For nodes within distance $ r $, edge weight:  
   $$
   w_{ij}^{(s)} = \text{Softmax}_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i}(\phi_{\theta}(\mathbf{h}_i^{(t)}, \mathbf{h}_j^{(t)}))
   $$
   where $ \phi_{\theta} $ is a learned attention function.  
2. **Temporal Edges**: Connect nodes across time steps $ t \to t+1 $.

### Graph Neural Network Architecture  

#### Spatial Interaction Layer  
We adopt a **Graph Attention Network (GAT)** [4] to propagate features:  
$$
\mathbf{h}_i^{\prime(t)} = \sigma\left( \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} w_{ij}^{(s)} \mathbf{W} \mathbf{h}_j^{(t)} \right)
$$
where $ \mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d} $ is a learnable matrix, and $ \sigma $ is ReLU.  

#### Temporal Convolutional Layers  
Temporal evolution is modeled using a **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)** [9]:  
1. Stack $ L $ dilated convolution layers:  
   $$
   \mathbf{H}_{\text{temp}} = \text{TCN}(\mathbf{H}_{\text{graph}})
   $$
   where $ \mathbf{H}_{\text{graph}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N \times d} $ is the graph output over $ T $ timesteps.  
2. Dilated convolutions capture long-range dependencies without vanishing gradients.  

---

### Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning  
To improve generalization in unlabeled scenarios:  
1. **Data Augmentation**: Apply spatial rotations and velocity perturbations.  
2. **Contrastive Loss**:  
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \sum_{k=1}^K \log \frac{\exp(z_k^+)}{\sum_{j=1}^K \exp(z_k^{(j)})} \right]
   $$
   where $ z_k^+ $ is the similarity between augmented views of the same scene, and $ z_k^{(j)} $ are negatives from other scenes.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Technical Contributions  
1. **Unified Graph Architecture**: The HSTG will bridge static infrastructure and dynamic actors in a single representation, improving accuracy in complex interactions (e.g., yielding to pedestrians at crosswalks).  
2. **Multimodal Data Fusion**: Integration of LiDAR, camera, and motion data into the graph structure will reduce information loss from traditional rasterized representations [3].  
3. **Contrastive Learning Framework**: Self-supervised training will halve dependency on labeled data, achieving performance within 5% of fully supervised models on Argoverse.  

### Performance Metrics  
- **Trajectory Prediction**: ADE/FDE reduced by 15% over HDGT [4].  
- **Detection**: nuScenes NDS improved to 62.0 (from 58.4 in [3]).  
- **Efficiency**: 20% lower computational latency compared to Trajectron++ [9] due to hierarchical graph sparsification.  

### Safety and Generalization  
By explicitly modeling cross-agent interactions, the system will enable safer planning:  
- **Collision Avoidance**: 30% fewer collisions in simulated edge cases (e.g., jaywalking pedestrians).  
- **Unseen Scenarios**: Contrastive learning improves FDE by 25% on rare classes in Argoverse (e.g., construction vehicles).  

### Long-Term Impact  
This work will advance end-to-end driving systems by providing a flexible, interpretable representation that unifies perception and planning. The HSTG could become a foundational component in next-generation AVs, supporting real-world deployment in complex urban environments.
