### Title: Multi-Modal Scene Representations for Enhanced Autonomous Driving

### Motivation
The integration of various sensors and modalities in autonomous driving is crucial for robust and safe operation. However, the current scene representations often lack a unified framework that can effectively integrate and utilize diverse data sources. This research aims to address this gap by developing a multi-modal scene representation that enhances perception, prediction, and planning in autonomous driving.

### Main Idea
This research proposes a novel multi-modal scene representation framework that leverages deep learning techniques to fuse information from different sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radar. The framework consists of three main components:

1. **Sensor Fusion Module**: A deep neural network that fuses data from multiple sensors to create a comprehensive scene representation. This module employs attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of each sensor's input based on the current driving scenario.

2. **Contextual Embedding Module**: This module generates contextual embeddings that capture the spatial and temporal relationships within the scene. It uses a transformer-based architecture to model long-range dependencies and contextual information.

3. **Interpretability and Safety Module**: This module ensures that the generated scene representations are interpretable and safe. It employs explainable AI techniques to provide insights into the decision-making process and incorporates safety constraints to prevent unsafe maneuvers.

The expected outcomes of this research include improved perception accuracy, more reliable prediction models, and enhanced planning capabilities. The potential impact is a significant advancement in the safety, reliability, and efficiency of autonomous driving systems.
