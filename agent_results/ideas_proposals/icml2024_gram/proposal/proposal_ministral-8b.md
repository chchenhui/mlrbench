# Geometric Priors for Motion Planning in Robotics

## Introduction

Motion planning in robotics is a fundamental task that involves finding collision-free paths for robots to navigate from a start configuration to a goal configuration while respecting physical constraints. Traditional methods often rely on exhaustive exploration of high-dimensional configuration spaces or overfitted models that fail in novel environments. By incorporating geometric priors into learning-based motion planners, we can significantly improve sample efficiency, generalization capabilities, and solution quality while ensuring physical plausibility of generated trajectories. This research proposal outlines a structure-inducing approach that embeds geometric priors directly into neural network architectures for motion planning.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. To develop a framework that integrates geometric priors into neural network architectures for motion planning.
2. To demonstrate improved sample efficiency, generalization, and solution quality compared to traditional methods.
3. To ensure that generated trajectories respect physical constraints without explicit regularization.

### Significance

The proposed method has significant implications for robotics and related fields. By leveraging geometric priors, we can:
- Enhance the efficiency of motion planning algorithms by reducing the need for exhaustive exploration.
- Improve generalization capabilities, enabling robots to adapt to novel environments.
- Ensure that planned trajectories are physically plausible, reducing the risk of collisions and other safety issues.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed method employs a two-stage architecture for motion planning:
1. **Geometric Encoder**: This stage maps workspace obstacles onto the robot's configuration space manifold using SE(3) equivariant operations.
2. **Trajectory Generator**: This stage produces paths constrained to geodesics on the manifold using Riemannian optimization.

### Data Collection

The data collection process involves:
- **Workspace Data**: Obtaining 3D point clouds or other representations of the workspace, including obstacles and the robot's start and goal configurations.
- **Robot Kinematics**: Collecting data on the robot's kinematic constraints, such as joint limits and workspace boundaries.
- **Environment Geometry**: Gathering information about the environment's geometry, including walls, floors, and other static objects.

### Algorithmic Steps

#### Stage 1: Geometric Encoder

1. **Input**: Workspace data, robot kinematics, and environment geometry.
2. **SE(3) Equivariant Operations**: Apply SE(3) equivariant operations to map the workspace obstacles onto the robot's configuration space manifold.
3. **Manifold Embedding**: Embed the mapped obstacles into the configuration space manifold using a manifold-aware representation.

#### Stage 2: Trajectory Generator

1. **Input**: Manifold-embedded workspace data.
2. **Riemannian Optimization**: Formulate the motion planning problem as optimization on the appropriate manifold (e.g., SE(2) for mobile robots, SO(3) for orientation).
3. **Geodesic Paths**: Generate trajectories constrained to geodesics on the manifold using Riemannian optimization techniques.

### Mathematical Formulation

The optimization problem can be formulated as follows:
$$
\min_{\mathbf{x}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{geodesic}}(\mathbf{x}) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{constraints}}(\mathbf{x})
$$
where:
- $\mathbf{x}$ represents the robot's configuration.
- $\mathbf{y}$ represents the workspace obstacles.
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{geodesic}}(\mathbf{x})$ is the geodesic distance on the manifold.
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{constraints}}(\mathbf{x})$ represents the constraints derived from the robot's kinematics and environment geometry.
- $\lambda$ is a regularization parameter.

### Experimental Design

To validate the method, we will conduct experiments in various simulated and real-world environments. The evaluation metrics include:
- **Planning Time**: Measure the time taken to generate a valid trajectory.
- **Success Rate**: Calculate the percentage of successful plans (collision-free paths reaching the goal).
- **Path Quality**: Assess the quality of the generated paths using metrics such as path length and smoothness.
- **Generalization**: Evaluate the method's ability to generalize to novel environments with previously unseen obstacles.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Improved Sample Efficiency**: The proposed method will demonstrate reduced planning time compared to sampling-based methods.
2. **Enhanced Generalization**: The method will show superior generalization capabilities in environments with previously unseen obstacles.
3. **Physically Plausible Trajectories**: The generated trajectories will respect physical constraints without explicit regularization.
4. **Reduced Computational Complexity**: The method will reduce the computational complexity of motion planning by leveraging geometric priors.

### Impact

The proposed research has the potential to significantly impact the field of robotics by:
- **Enhancing Robustness**: By incorporating geometric priors, robots can navigate complex and dynamic environments more robustly.
- **Improving Efficiency**: The method will enable more efficient motion planning, reducing the computational burden on robots and their controllers.
- **Enabling Real-Time Planning**: The reduced planning time will allow robots to make quick decisions in real-time applications.
- **Promoting Interdisciplinary Research**: The integration of geometric priors into neural network architectures can inspire further research in areas such as computer vision, computer graphics, and control systems.
