Title  
E(3)-Equivariant Geometric Attention Networks for High-Precision Structure-Based Drug Design  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Drug discovery remains one of the most costly, time-consuming, and failure-prone endeavors in modern biotechnology. From target identification through lead optimization to clinical trials, each phase can take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to exploit three-dimensional (3D) information about protein targets and candidate ligands to accelerate early-stage discovery, improve binding affinities, and reduce off-target effects. In recent years, deep learning—especially graph neural networks (GNNs)—has demonstrated promising results for molecular property prediction, binding affinity estimation, and de novo molecule generation. However, most existing models fail to fully exploit the geometric symmetries inherent in 3D molecular structures, leading to suboptimal generalization across protein families, sensitivity to molecular pose, and limited ability to propose novel chemotypes.

Equivariance under the Euclidean group E(3) (rotations, reflections, and translations) is crucial for any model that consumes raw 3D coordinates: an equivariant model ensures that a rotated input yields a predictably rotated output, rather than arbitrary behavior. Recent works (EquiPocket, EquiCPI, SE(3)-Transformer) have shown that explicitly encoding E(3)-equivariance can significantly improve performance on tasks such as binding site prediction and protein–ligand affinity estimation. Separately, hierarchical attention mechanisms have been used to identify critical substructures in molecules and proteins, but these have largely been applied in 2D or non-equivariant contexts.

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop and validate a novel E(3)-equivariant geometric attention network (EGAN) that:  
• Jointly models protein and ligand as a heterogeneous, multi-scale graph with node coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and chemical features.  
• Incorporates hierarchical attention at both the atomic and residue/pocket levels to identify key interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts).  
• Predicts protein–ligand binding affinity with state-of-the-art accuracy on standard benchmarks (CASF-2016, PDBbind).  
• Iteratively refines 3D ligand structures via gradient-based optimization to generate novel molecules with improved predicted affinities.  

Significance  
A successful model would:  
1. Provide highly accurate in silico binding affinity predictions, reducing costly wet-lab screening.  
2. Enable virtual high-throughput screening with fewer false positives.  
3. Offer interpretable attention maps highlighting critical interaction sites, guiding medicinal chemists.  
4. Generate candidate ligands in 3D coordinate space, streamlining lead optimization.  

2. Related Work  
Equivariance in GNNs  
• EquiPocket (Zhang et al., 2023) and EquiCPI (Nguyen, 2025) apply E(3)/SE(3)-equivariant layers to ligand binding site prediction and affinity estimation, demonstrating improved robustness to molecular pose.  
• SE(3)-Transformer and EGNN (Jing et al., 2021) provide general frameworks for E(3)-equivariant message passing on 3D graphs.  

Attention Mechanisms  
• HAC-Net (Kyro et al., 2022) integrates 3D convolutions with attention to predict affinities but lacks full equivariance.  
• Geometric Attention Networks (Johnson & Lee, 2024) use spatial attention to highlight interaction hotspots, but their architecture is not explicitly equivariant.  
• Hierarchical attention for drug discovery (Green & Black, 2024) improves interpretability but was demonstrated on 2D molecular graphs.  

Generative Models  
• Attention-based molecular generation (Purple & Yellow, 2024) and diffusion models offer ligand generation in 2D or SMILES space but rarely refine 3D coordinates.  
• Existing equivariant generative models (e.g., EGNN Diffusion) have shown promise but have not been applied to structure-based contexts.  

Gaps  
Despite these advances, no published work unifies E(3)-equivariance with hierarchical attention in a GNN that both predicts affinities and directly generates/refines 3D ligand structures.  

3. Methodology  
Overview  
We propose EGAN, a two-branch model: (1) an affinity prediction branch trained on protein–ligand complexes, and (2) a generative refinement branch that iteratively updates ligand coordinates to maximize predicted affinity.

3.1 Data Collection & Preprocessing  
Datasets  
• PDBbind v2020 refined set (~17 000 complexes) with experimentally measured binding affinities.  
• CASF-2016 core set (~285 complexes) for benchmarking scoring, ranking, and docking power.  
• DUD-E decoys for virtual screening evaluation.  

Preprocessing  
1. Filter complexes: X-ray resolution ≤ 2.5 Å; remove ligands > 60 heavy atoms.  
2. Protonate with OpenBabel; assign partial charges via AM1-BCC.  
3. Construct heterogeneous graph $G=(V_p\cup V_l, E_{pp}, E_{ll}, E_{pl})$:  
   – $V_p$: protein atoms; $V_l$: ligand atoms.  
   – $E_{pp}$, $E_{ll}$: covalent bonds or residue adjacency.  
   – $E_{pl}$: noncovalent edges if interatomic distance ≤ 5 Å.  
4. Node features $h_i$: one-hot atom type, residue type, partial charge, hybridization.  
5. Coordinates $x_i\in\mathbb{R}^3$ for all atoms.

3.2 Model Architecture  
Let $G$ be the input graph. We stack $L$ E(3)-equivariant message-passing layers with hierarchical attention. At layer $l$, each node $i$ has hidden feature $h_i^{(l)}$ (scalar) and coordinate $x_i^{(l)}$ (vector).

Message Passing  
For each pair $(i,j)\in E$, compute an equivariant message:  
$$
m_{ij}^{(l)} = \phi_m\big(h_i^{(l)},\,h_j^{(l)},\,\|x_i^{(l)}-x_j^{(l)}\|^2\big)\,,
$$  
where $\phi_m$ is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Update scalar features:  
$$
h_i^{(l+1)} = \phi_h\Big(h_i^{(l)},\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)}\alpha_{ij}^{(l)}\;m_{ij}^{(l)}\Big)\,,
$$  
and coordinates:  
$$
x_i^{(l+1)} = x_i^{(l)} + \sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)} (x_i^{(l)}-x_j^{(l)})\,\phi_x(m_{ij}^{(l)})\,.
$$  

Hierarchical Attention  
We compute two levels of attention weights $\alpha_{ij}^{(l)}$:  
1. Atom-level:  
   $$
   e_{ij}^{(l)} = \psi\big(h_i^{(l)},\,h_j^{(l)},\,\|x_i^{(l)}-x_j^{(l)}\|\big)\,,\quad
   \alpha_{ij}^{(l)}=\frac{\exp(e_{ij}^{(l)})}{\sum_{k\in\mathcal{N}(i)}\exp(e_{ik}^{(l)})}\,,
   $$  
   where $\psi$ is an MLP producing a scalar score.  
2. Pocket-level: we cluster protein atoms into residues or functional pockets using a small GNN, then apply a second attention mechanism across clusters to reweight messages globally.  

Affinity Prediction  
After $L$ layers, we derive a graph-level embedding by pooling:  
$$
h_G=\text{MLP}\Big(\sum_{i\in V_p\cup V_l}w_i\,h_i^{(L)}\Big)\,,
$$  
where $w_i$ are learned per-node weights that emphasize ligand atoms and contacting protein residues. A final linear layer yields predicted binding affinity $\hat y$ (e.g., $pK_d$).

Loss Function  
We train on $N$ complexes with measured affinities $y_n$:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\rm aff}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N\big(\hat y_n - y_n\big)^2 + \lambda\|\theta\|_2^2\,.
$$  

3.3 Generative Refinement Branch  
To generate or optimize a ligand $M$ within a fixed protein pocket $P$, we perform iterative coordinate updates. Let $\{x_i^t\}$ denote ligand atomic coordinates at step $t$. We maximize $\hat y = f_\theta(P,M)$ via gradient ascent in coordinate space:  
For $t=0\ldots T-1$:  
$$
x^{{t+1}} = x^t + \gamma\;\nabla_{x^t}\,f_\theta(P,M)\,,
$$  
subject to chemical constraints: bond lengths remain within [min,max] thresholds; we project updated coordinates onto valid bond geometries using a simple structural relaxation (e.g., rigid-body bond length correction). The step size $\gamma$ is annealed from $0.1\,\text{Å}$ to $0.01\,\text{Å}$ over $T=20$ steps. After refinement, we conduct a quick energy minimization with OpenMM to relieve clashes.

4.3 Long-Term Vision  
By delivering an integrated, interpretable, and high-precision platform for structure-based drug design, this research will pave the way for AI-driven discovery pipelines that can propose, refine, and validate candidate therapeutics with minimal wet-lab overhead. Future extensions include coupling the model with generative diffusion processes, reinforcement learning for multi-objective optimization (e.g., ADMET), and integration with multi-omics data for precision medicine.  

In summary, this proposal combines state-of-the-art E(3)-equivariant GNNs and hierarchical attention to tackle key challenges in structure-based drug discovery, promising both predictive accuracy and generative capacity to streamline the path from 3D structure to novel therapeutics.
