# Self-Supervised Molecular Pre-training for Enhanced Drug Repurposing

## Motivation
Drug repurposing offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional drug discovery by identifying new therapeutic applications for existing drugs. However, current computational approaches often struggle with limited labeled data and capturing complex molecular interactions. This research addresses these challenges by developing a novel self-supervised learning framework that leverages the vast amounts of unlabeled molecular data to enhance drug repurposing capabilities, potentially reducing the time and cost of bringing new treatments to patients while addressing therapeutic areas with significant unmet needs.

## Main Idea
The proposed research develops a multi-modal self-supervised pre-training framework that jointly learns from molecular structures, bioactivity profiles, and clinical data without requiring explicit labels. Our approach integrates three key components: (1) a molecular graph transformer that captures structural information through masked substructure prediction, (2) a cross-modal contrastive learning module that aligns representations across modalities, and (3) a biological pathway-aware attention mechanism that incorporates domain knowledge. The pre-trained model can then be fine-tuned for specific drug repurposing tasks with minimal labeled data. We expect this approach to significantly outperform existing methods on standard benchmarks like DrugBank and TWOSIDES, particularly for rare diseases with limited training data. The framework's modular design also allows for continuous incorporation of new biomedical knowledge, creating an evolving system that improves with domain advances.
