1. **Title**: Neural Differential Geometry for Dynamic Molecular Representations  
2. **Motivation**: Accurate molecular representation is critical for predicting drug-target interactions and optimizing pharmaceutical properties. Existing methods often oversimplify molecular structures (e.g., static 2D graphs or rigid 3D coordinates), neglecting conformational flexibility and dynamic interactions. This limits predictive accuracy for binding affinity, solubility, and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity). A dynamic, physics-informed representation that captures molecular motion and spatial relationships could bridge this gap.  
3. **Main Idea**: Develop a **Neural Differential Geometry (NDG)** framework that integrates continuous 3D molecular dynamics with geometric deep learning. The method uses neural differential equations to model conformational changes as continuous trajectories in 3D space, preserving SE(3)-equivariance for rotational/translational invariance. A temporal-attention mechanism weights conformational states, while graph neural networks distill these states into a low-dimensional representation. This representation is used for multitask prediction of binding affinity, solubility, and toxicology. Training leverages large-scale molecular dynamics simulations (e.g., MD trajectories) alongside experimental datasets (e.g., PDBbind, ChEMBL). Expected outcomes include improved predictive accuracy, reduced reliance on computationally expensive docking simulations, and generalizability across undersampled drug-like molecules. Impact: Accelerated molecule optimization pipelines, better precision in preclinical safety assessments, and robustness to experimental data scarcity.
