**Title:** **E(3)-Equivariant Geometric Attention Networks for High-Precision Structure-Based Drug Design**  

**Motivation:**  
Current AI models for structure-based drug design often struggle to fully exploit 3D structural and chemical data, leading to suboptimal binding affinity predictions and molecule generation. Accurately modeling spatial interactions between proteins and ligands is critical to reduce costly experimental trial-and-error in drug discovery.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a novel **E(3)-equivariant graph neural network (GNN)** integrated with **hierarchical attention mechanisms** to model protein-ligand interactions. The model encodes 3D atomic coordinates and chemical features using E(3)-equivariant layers to preserve rotational/translational symmetries, ensuring robustness to molecular poses. Attention mechanisms then prioritize critical interaction sites (e.g., catalytic residues, binding pockets). The framework is trained on diverse protein-ligand complexes (e.g., PDBbind) to predict binding affinities and generate optimized molecules by iteratively refining 3D candidate structures.  

**Expected Outcomes & Impact:**  
The model aims to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in affinity prediction benchmarks and generate molecules with improved binding properties. If successful, this could streamline early-stage drug discovery by enabling rapid, precise virtual screening and structure-guided optimization, reducing time and costs for bringing therapies to market.
