# Explainable Mathematical Reasoning for LLMs through Knowledge Graphs

## Motivation
While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in mathematical reasoning, they often function as black boxes, making it difficult to understand their reasoning processes or identify where errors occur. This opacity limits their trustworthiness in critical applications like education, scientific research, and financial modeling. Additionally, current LLMs struggle with complex multi-step mathematical reasoning that requires maintaining coherent logical chains across multiple operations. Addressing these limitations is crucial for developing AI systems that not only solve mathematical problems but can explain their reasoning in human-interpretable ways.

## Main Idea
We propose integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs to create a hybrid system for explainable mathematical reasoning. The system would dynamically construct a mathematical reasoning graph during problem-solving, with nodes representing concepts, theorems, and intermediate calculations, and edges representing logical relationships. When solving problems, the LLM would explicitly update this graph, making each reasoning step transparent. This architecture offers three key advantages: (1) improved explainability by visualizing the complete reasoning chain, (2) enhanced reasoning capabilities by reducing hallucinations through structured representations, and (3) better error detection by allowing targeted inspection of specific reasoning steps. We will evaluate this approach on complex mathematical reasoning benchmarks while measuring both accuracy and explainability metrics to demonstrate its practical value in educational and scientific applications.
