1. **Title**: Adaptive AI Tutoring for Personalized Mathematical Reasoning Development in Resource-Limited Settings  

2. **Motivation**: Over 250 million children globally lack basic numeracy skills, exacerbated by a shortage of qualified educators. Traditional math tutoring systems often fail to adapt to individual reasoning gaps or are too costly to deploy at scale. AI tutors could democratize access to personalized learning but remain underexplored in low-resource environments. This research addresses how adaptive models can simultaneously detect cognitive misconceptions, scaffold problem-solving, and cultivate deeper mathematical reasoning in underserved learners.  

3. **Main Idea**: Develop a context-aware AI tutor using lightweight, fine-tuned language models that dynamicly trace student reasoning paths during problem-solving. The system will analyze stepwise responses (even incorrect ones), map them to cognitive frameworks (e.g., relational vs. instrumental understanding), and deliver targeted, Socratic-guided hints rather than direct answers. Training will leverage crowdsourced datasets of error patterns from low-bandwidth regions, while the interface will prioritize voice input and offline functionality. A key technical innovation is the integration of probabilistic logic programming to align neural predictions with formal mathematical axioms, improving reasoning coherence. Piloted in rural classrooms, this tutor will be evaluated on its ability to shift learning outcomes beyond procedural memorization, particularly enhancing abstract reasoning capabilities through iterative feedback loops. Success could transform equity in STEM education and provide empirical insights into human-AI collaborative cognition.
