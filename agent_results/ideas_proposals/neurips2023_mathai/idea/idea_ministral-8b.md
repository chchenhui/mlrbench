### Title: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in AI with Explainable Large Language Models

### Motivation:
The ability of AI to comprehend and reason mathematically is crucial for advancing various fields, from scientific research to software development. However, current AI models often lack transparency and fail to provide clear explanations for their reasoning processes, making them less trustworthy and less effective in complex mathematical tasks. This research aims to address these challenges by developing explainable large language models (LLMs) that can not only perform mathematical reasoning but also provide clear, human-understandable explanations for their decisions.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research focuses on creating explainable large language models that can perform mathematical reasoning tasks while providing clear, step-by-step explanations for their solutions. The methodology involves:
1. **Model Architecture**: Designing a LLM architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms to highlight the most relevant parts of the input and intermediate steps of the reasoning process.
2. **Explanation Generation**: Developing a module within the LLM that can generate natural language explanations for each step of the reasoning process.
3. **Evaluation Benchmarks**: Creating a benchmark dataset that includes both mathematical problems and their corresponding human-understandable explanations to evaluate the model's performance and explainability.
4. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Investigating how these explainable models can be integrated into educational settings to enhance learning and collaboration between humans and AI in mathematical problem-solving.

Expected outcomes include:
- Enhanced transparency and trust in AI-driven mathematical reasoning.
- Improved performance in complex mathematical tasks through better understanding and collaboration between AI and humans.
- New educational tools that leverage AI to provide personalized and explainable learning experiences.

Potential impact:
This research has the potential to revolutionize how mathematical reasoning is approached in AI, fostering more effective collaboration between humans and AI, and opening up new possibilities in education, research, and various industries that rely on mathematical reasoning.
