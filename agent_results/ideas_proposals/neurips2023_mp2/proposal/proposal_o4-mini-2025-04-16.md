Title  
Developmental Scaffolding for Moral AI: A Stage-Based Curriculum Inspired by Kohlberg’s Moral Development Theory  

Introduction  
Background.  Modern large-scale AI systems (e.g., LLMs trained with RLHF) have made impressive strides in natural language understanding and decision-making. However, their approaches to moral alignment are often “monolithic”: a single round of human feedback or static reward models. In contrast, human moral reasoning emerges over time through a sequence of developmental stages, as described by Kohlberg’s theory of moral development and related work in moral psychology. Infants and children first learn to avoid punishment and seek rewards (pre-conventional stage), then internalize social norms and expectations (conventional), and finally adopt abstract ethical principles (post-conventional). We argue that emulating this staged learning process in AI can yield more robust, context-sensitive, and adaptive moral reasoning.  

Research Objectives.  This project aims to:  
1. Design a curriculum for training AI agents through discrete moral development stages, each with tailored data, objectives, and reward signals.  
2. Formulate and implement a multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) framework that transitions agents automatically from one stage to the next based on performance thresholds.  
3. Evaluate whether “developmentally scaffolded” AI exhibits superior moral reasoning—measured by accuracy on benchmark moral dilemma tests, consistency with diverse value systems, and capacity for contextual adaptation—compared to baseline monolithic RLHF or IRL methods.  

Significance.  By grounding AI moral alignment in well-established developmental psychology, we expect to achieve:  
• Enhanced adaptability: Agents learn simple rules first, then generalize to complex abstract principles.  
• Better transparency: Stage-wise progression offers interpretable checkpoints.  
• Cross-cultural robustness: Early stages emphasize universal rules, later stages incorporate culturally specific norms through observational learning.  
• Reduced bias and unintended behaviors: Gradual scaffolding may mitigate overfitting to a particular dataset or feedback loop.  

Methodology  
Overview.  We propose a four-stage curriculum (including a preparatory phase) modeled on Kohlberg’s theory. Each stage corresponds to a Markov decision process (MDP) $M_i=(\mathcal S,\mathcal A,T,R_i,\gamma)$ with distinct reward functions $R_i$. Agents advance to the next stage only after satisfying a performance criterion.  

Data Collection and Stage Design  
Stage 0 (Preparatory): Basic language and knowledge grounding.  
• Data: General domain text corpora (Books, Wikipedia, Common Crawl).  
• Objective: Ensure fluency and factual reasoning.  
• Method: Pretrain a transformer model via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).  

Stage 1 (Pre-Conventional Moral Learning): Rule following and consequence awareness.  
• Data: Synthetic moral dilemma dialogues with explicit “right/wrong” labels (e.g., “stealing is punished,” “helping is rewarded”).  
• Reward $R_1(s,a)$: +1 for actions conforming to explicit rules; –1 otherwise.  
• Method: Reinforcement learning (e.g., PPO) to maximize  
  $$J_1(\theta)=\mathbb E_{\tau\sim\pi_\theta}\Bigl[\sum_{t=0}^T\gamma^tR_1(s_t,a_t)\Bigr].$$  

Stage 2 (Conventional Moral Learning): Social norms and peer approval.  
• Data: Human conversation logs annotated for social appropriateness; observational trajectories from crowd workers modeling social approval.  
• Reward $R_2(s,a)$ learned via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL):  
  $$\hat R_2=\arg\max_{R}\sum_{\tau\in\mathcal D}\log P(\tau\mid R),$$  
  where $\mathcal D$ is the demonstration set.  
• Method: First estimate $\hat R_2$, then apply RL to maximize $J_2(\theta)$ analogous to Stage 1.  

Stage 3 (Post-Conventional Moral Learning): Abstract ethical principles.  
• Data: Curated moral philosophy texts (e.g., Kant’s categorical imperative, Rawls’ justice theory), case studies of ethical dilemmas without clear societal consensus.  
• Reward $R_3(s,a)$: A composite function combining fidelity to abstract rules $R_{\rm abs}(s,a)$ (derived from propositional logic encodings of moral principles) and feedback from expert annotations ($\pm1$).  
  $$R_3(s,a)=\lambda_{\rm abs}R_{\rm abs}(s,a)+\lambda_{\rm exp}R_{\rm exp}(s,a).$$  
• Method: Multi-objective RL or hierarchical RL to balance competing principles.  

Stage 4 (Simulation and Cultural Adaptation): Integrating cultural variability.  
• Data: Culturally diverse human behavior logs; specify a latent cultural variable $c$ for each trajectory.  
• Reward $R_4(s,a,c)$: Conditioned on $c$, estimated via IRL per culture group.  
• Method: Meta-learning (e.g., MAML) to adapt quickly to new cultural contexts.  

Curriculum Progression  
Agents transition from Stage $i$ to $i+1$ when they exceed a threshold $\tau_i$ on an evaluation suite $\mathcal E_i$. Each $\mathcal E_i$ consists of held-out dilemmas and normative tasks tailored to the stage’s complexity. For example:  
• Stage 1: 100 rule-based quizzes, require ≥95% accuracy.  
• Stage 2: 50 social appropriateness rating tasks, require ≥90% approval.  
• Stage 3: 20 abstract reasoning cases, require ≥85% agreement with expert consensus.  

Algorithmic Workflow (Pseudocode)  
```
Initialize model parameters θ via Stage 0 pretraining.
for i in {1,2,3,4} do
  if i == 1 then
    define reward R_i from synthetic labels.
  else if i == 2 or 4 then
    estimate R_i via IRL on dataset D_i.
  else if i == 3 then
    construct R_3 as composite of R_abs and R_exp.
  end if
  repeat
    collect rollouts τ ∼ π_θ in MDP M_i.
    compute policy gradient ∇_θJ_i(θ).
    update θ ← θ + α ∇_θJ_i(θ).
    evaluate on E_i to get score s_i.
  until s_i ≥ τ_i or max iterations reached.
end for
Return final policy π_θ.
```

Evaluation and Experimental Design  
Baselines.  
1. Standard RLHF: A single-stage RLHF model trained on human feedback for moral tasks.  
2. Static IRL: IRL-trained policy without curriculum.  
3. Ablation variants: omit Stage 2 or Stage 3, or shuffle stage order.  

Datasets for Testing.  
• Moral Foundations Questionnaire (adapted for AI).  
• ETHICS benchmark (moral scenarios and Q&A).  
• Custom cross-cultural dilemma sets collected via crowd sourcing.  

Evaluation Metrics.  
1. Moral Accuracy: Percentage of correct responses on held-out dilemmas.  
2. Consistency Score: Measure of internal coherence across similar cases (e.g., Cohen’s κ between paired scenarios).  
3. Adaptability Index: Drop in performance when shifting to novel cultures or domains.  
4. Fairness and Bias Metrics: Disparate impact across demographic attributes embedded in scenario contexts.  
5. Human Trust and Interpretability: User studies rating trustworthiness and perceived transparency (Likert scales).  

Statistical Analysis.  
• Use paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare stage-scaffolded AI with baselines.  
• Estimate effect sizes (Cohen’s d) for each metric.  
• Perform ablation significance to assess the contribution of each stage.  

Infrastructure and Implementation Details  
• Base model: Transformer (e.g., 6-layer, 512-hidden, 8-head attention).  
• RL algorithms: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for policy learning, MaxEnt IRL for reward estimation.  
• Hardware: Distributed training on 16 GPUs; simulation environments for interactive dialogues.  
• Code repository and parameter settings will be published for reproducibility.
