**Adaptive Procedural Generation for Dynamic Assessment of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models**

### 2. Introduction  
**Background**  
Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of human intelligence, enabling problem-solving across scientific, engineering, and everyday contexts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to solve mathematical problems, yet their true reasoning capabilities remain poorly understood. Static benchmarks like MATH and GSM8k, while valuable, are increasingly compromised by data contamination—LLMs trained on vast web corpora may memorize solutions rather than develop genuine reasoning skills. This limitation underscores the need for dynamic evaluation frameworks that assess generalization, adaptability, and reasoning processes.

**Research Objectives**  
This project aims to:  
1. Develop a **procedural content generation (PCG)** system for creating mathematical problems that dynamically adapt to LLM performance, ensuring contamination-resistant evaluation.  
2. Design a diagnostic framework to profile LLM reasoning abilities, identifying strengths and weaknesses across skills like algebraic manipulation, logical deduction, and geometric intuition.  
3. Establish metrics for evaluating both final answers and intermediate reasoning steps, moving beyond accuracy to assess validity, redundancy, and strategy selection.  

**Significance**  
Current benchmarks fail to capture the *process* of mathematical reasoning, conflating pattern matching with true comprehension. By generating novel, adaptive problems, this work will:  
- Provide a robust evaluation tool for LLMs, resistant to data contamination.  
- Enable fine-grained analysis of reasoning capabilities, informing model improvement.  
- Support applications in education (e.g., personalized tutoring) and AI safety (e.g., verifying logical consistency).

### 3. Methodology  

#### 3.1 Problem Generation Framework  
**Data Collection & Template Design**  
- **Skill-Specific Templates**: Define parameterized problem templates for core mathematical domains (e.g., algebra, geometry). For example, an algebraic template might generate quadratic equations:  
  $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$  
  where coefficients $a, b, c$ are sampled from ranges that control difficulty (e.g., $a \in [1, 5]$, $b \in [-10, 10]$, $c \in \mathbb{Z}$).  
- **Constraint-Based Generation**: Use symbolic constraints to ensure problems are solvable and non-trivial (e.g., enforcing $b^2 - 4ac \geq 0$ for real roots).  

**Procedural Adaptation Algorithm**  
1. **Initialization**: Generate a problem $P_0$ with baseline difficulty $d_0$ using template parameters.  
2. **Model Response**: Query the LLM to solve $P_i$, extracting both the final answer $A_i$ and reasoning steps $S_i$.  
3. **Difficulty Adjustment**: Update difficulty $d_{i+1}$ using a Bayesian estimator:  
   $$d_{i+1} = d_i + \alpha \cdot (C_i - P(\text{correct} | d_i, \theta)),$$  
   where $C_i \in \{0, 1\}$ indicates correctness, $\theta$ is the model’s estimated ability, and $\alpha$ controls the adaptation rate.  
4. **Template Variation**: If the model solves $P_i$ correctly, apply transformations to $P_i$ (e.g., adding redundant steps, altering problem structure) to test robustness.  

#### 3.2 Evaluation Metrics  
- **Accuracy**: Fraction of correct final answers.  
- **Reasoning Quality**: Use **ReasonEval** (Xia et al., 2024) to score validity and redundancy in $S_i$.  
- **Diversity**: Entropy of generated problem features (e.g., coefficient ranges, geometric configurations).  
- **Generalization Gap**: Performance difference between seen and unseen problem templates.  

#### 3.3 Experimental Design  
- **Models**: Evaluate GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini Pro, and open-source models (e.g., LLaMA-3).  
- **Baselines**: Compare against static benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k) and prior adaptive systems (Mathador-LM).  
- **Ablation Studies**: Test the impact of difficulty adjustment and template variation modules.

### 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Contamination-Resistant Benchmark**: A procedurally generated dataset of 10,000+ problems across mathematical domains, with adaptive difficulty.  
2. **Diagnostic Profiles**: Quantitative summaries of LLM reasoning weaknesses (e.g., poor handling of negative coefficients in algebra).  
3. **Generalization Insights**: Evidence that LLMs overfit to static benchmarks, with performance drops of 15–30% on adaptive problems.  

**Impact**  
- **AI Development**: Enable targeted model improvements by identifying reasoning gaps.  
- **Education**: Support adaptive tutoring systems that adjust problem difficulty for learners.  
- **AI Safety**: Provide tools to verify logical consistency in mission-critical applications (e.g., theorem proving).
