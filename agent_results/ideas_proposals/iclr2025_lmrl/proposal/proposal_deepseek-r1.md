**Research Proposal: Causal Graph-Contrast: A Multimodal Pretraining Framework for Cross-Scale Biological Representations**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Biological systems are inherently multimodal and multiscale, spanning molecular interactions, cellular dynamics, and organism-wide phenotypes. Recent advances in high-throughput technologies—such as single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial omics, and high-content imaging—have produced vast datasets capturing these complex relationships. Foundation models trained on such data (e.g., protein language models, cell embedding frameworks) have shown promise but remain limited by their inability to (1) unify *cross-scale* interactions (e.g., atom-to-cell relationships) and (2) disentangle *causal* mechanisms underlying biological responses to perturbations. These limitations hinder progress toward predictive in-silico models for drug discovery, virtual cell simulation, and phenotype prediction.  

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal addresses these gaps by introducing **Causal Graph-Contrast**, a self-supervised pretraining framework designed to:  
1. **Integrate molecular and cellular data** into heterogeneous graphs that capture hierarchical relationships (atom → protein → cell).  
2. **Learn causal, perturbation-invariant representations** through multimodal contrastive learning and causal intervention modeling.  
3. **Enable robust generalization** to unseen biological conditions (e.g., novel drug compounds, genetic perturbations).  

**Significance**  
By unifying molecular and cellular graphs with causal reasoning, this work aims to bridge the gap between correlative embeddings and mechanistically interpretable representations. Successful implementation will advance foundational models for biology, with applications in drug response prediction, perturbation effect simulation, and precision medicine.

### 2. **Methodology**  

**Research Design**  
The framework consists of three stages: *data integration*, *self-supervised pretraining*, and *downstream task validation*.  

#### **2.1 Data Collection & Integration**  
- **Datasets**:  
  - **Molecular Graphs**: Small molecules (ChEMBL), protein structures (AlphaFold DB), and metabolic pathways (Reactome).  
  - **Cellular Graphs**: Cell morphology networks from JUMP-CP and RxRx3 imaging datasets.  
  - **Perturbation Metadata**: Dose-response data (DrugComb), CRISPR knockout effects (DepMap).  
- **Graph Construction**:  
  - **Atoms** (nodes) and **chemical bonds** (edges) form molecular subgraphs.  
  - **Cellular subgraphs** are extracted from imaging data by segmenting organelles and linking spatially adjacent regions.  
  - **Cross-Scale Edges**: Connect molecular subgraphs to cellular subgraphs via known interactions (e.g., drug targets, gene-protein associations).  

#### **2.2 Algorithmic Framework**  
**Step 1: Masked Node/Edge Recovery**  
- **Task**: Randomly mask 20% of nodes/edges in molecular and cellular subgraphs.  
- **Model**: A graph neural network (GNN) encoder (e.g., GraphSAGE) predicts masked features.  
- **Loss**: Cross-entropy for node labels (e.g., atom type) and mean squared error (MSE) for edge features (e.g., bond length):  
  $$  
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{mask}} = -\sum_{i \in \mathcal{M}} \log P\left(x_i | \mathbf{G}_{\text{masked}}\right) + \lambda \sum_{j \in \mathcal{E}} \left(\hat{e}_j - e_j\right)^2,  
  $$  
  where $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ are masked nodes/edges.  

**Step 2: Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning**  
- **Positive Pairs**: Molecular graph $G_m$ and cellular graph $G_c$ from the same perturbation (e.g., a drug and its morphological effects).  
- **Negative Pairs**: Randomly sampled $G_m$ and $G_c$ from different perturbations.  
- **Loss**: Normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy (NT-Xent):  
  $$  
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}} = -\log \frac{\exp\left(\text{sim}\left(\mathbf{h}_{G_m}, \mathbf{h}_{G_c}\right)/\tau\right)}{\sum_{k=1}^K \exp\left(\text{sim}\left(\mathbf{h}_{G_m}, \mathbf{h}_{G_c}^{(k)}\right)/\tau\right)},  
  $$  
  where $\mathbf{h}$ denotes graph embeddings, $\tau$ is temperature, and $\text{sim}$ is cosine similarity.  

**Step 3: Causal Intervention Modeling**  
- **Perturbation Variables**: Dose levels, genetic knockouts, or treatment durations.  
- **Counterfactual Augmentation**: Generate perturbed graphs $G_c^{\text{CF}}$ using structural causal models conditioned on interventions.  
- **Loss**: Minimize discrepancy between observed and counterfactual embeddings:  
  $$  
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}} = \mathbb{E}_{G_c, G_c^{\text{CF}}} \left[\left\|\mathbf{h}_{G_c} - \mathbf{h}_{G_c^{\text{CF}}}\right\|^2\right].  
  $$  

**Full Pretraining Loss**:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{mask}} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}} + \gamma \mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}.  
$$  

#### **2.3 Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against state-of-the-art methods:  
  - **MOGCL** (multi-omics contrastive learning)  
  - **HyperGCL** (hypergraph contrastive learning)  
  - **CausalRep** (latent causal variable disentanglement).  
- **Tasks**:  
  1. **Drug Response Prediction** (AUROC, RMSE).  
  2. **Few-Shot Phenotype Classification** (accuracy, F1-score).  
  3. **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization** (performance drop vs. domain adaptation metrics).  
- **Datasets**:  
  - **In-Domain**: Drugs and cell lines from DrugComb.  
  - **OOD**: Novel compounds in ChEMBL, unseen cell types in RxRx3.  
- **Ablation Studies**: Remove individual pretraining tasks (e.g., masking, contrastive learning) to isolate contributions.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Cross-Scale Representations**: Embeddings that encode hierarchical relationships (e.g., atom → pathway → phenotype).  
2. **Improved Generalization**: >15% higher AUROC on OOD drug response prediction compared to unimodal baselines.  
3. **Causal Interpretability**: Attention maps identifying critical molecular motifs and cellular regions driving predictions.  

**Impact**  
- **Biological Discovery**: Enable hypothesis generation for drug mechanisms (e.g., ligand-receptor interactions).  
- **Translational Applications**: Accelerate in-silico screening for drug repurposing and toxicity prediction.  
- **Benchmarking**: Release pretrained models and evaluation protocols to standardize representation learning in biology.
