### Title: "Harmonizing Multimodal Biological Representations via Multi-Scale Transformer Networks"

### Motivation:
The increasing availability of large-scale biological datasets necessitates the development of machine learning models capable of extracting meaningful representations that generalize well across different scales and modalities. Current methods often struggle to integrate information from disparate biological levels (e.g., genomic, proteomic, cellular) effectively. This research aims to address this challenge by proposing a novel multi-scale transformer network that harmonizes representations from different biological levels, enhancing the interpretability and utility of learned embeddings.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research will develop a Multi-Scale Transformer Network (MSTN) that integrates information from multiple biological modalities (genomic, proteomic, cellular) using a hierarchical transformer architecture. The MSTN will consist of three main components:

1. **Modality-specific Encoders**: Separate transformer encoders for each biological modality, capturing domain-specific features.
2. **Intermodal Fusion Layers**: Transformer layers that fuse information from different modalities, enabling cross-modal learning.
3. **Multi-Scale Decoder**: A decoder that aggregates information across different biological scales, from subcellular to organism-wide processes.

The methodology involves training the MSTN on a diverse set of biological datasets, including genomics, proteomics, and cell imaging data. The network will be evaluated using a combination of domain-specific benchmarks and generalizable tasks, ensuring that the learned representations capture rich biological information and generalize well to unseen data.

Expected outcomes include improved interpretability and utility of biological representations, enhanced in-silico simulation capabilities, and the development of a foundation model for AI-powered virtual cells. The potential impact of this research is significant, as it addresses a critical gap in the field of biological representation learning and paves the way for more accurate and efficient biological simulations.
