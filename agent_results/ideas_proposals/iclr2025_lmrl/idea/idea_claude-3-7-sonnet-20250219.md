# Causal Structural Learning for Biological Perturbation Analysis

## Motivation
Current foundation models in biology excel at capturing correlations in biological data but often struggle to identify causal relationships crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and drug effects. Perturbation experiments—where systems are deliberately altered—provide valuable causal insights but are costly and time-consuming. There is an urgent need for representation learning approaches that can effectively model the causal structure of biological systems to predict perturbation outcomes accurately and guide experimental design efficiently.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel framework that combines causal structure learning with representation learning to identify causal relationships in biological systems. Our approach leverages both observational data and limited perturbation experiments to learn representations that capture the underlying causal mechanisms. The methodology involves: (1) learning initial embeddings from large-scale observational data; (2) refining these representations using a causal discovery algorithm that incorporates domain knowledge as inductive bias; and (3) employing an active learning strategy to suggest the most informative perturbation experiments for model refinement. The framework will be validated on cell line perturbation datasets (e.g., LINCS L1000) by predicting gene expression changes following unseen interventions. Beyond improving perturbation effect predictions, this approach would enable in silico screening of therapeutic interventions, significantly accelerating drug discovery while reducing experimental costs.
