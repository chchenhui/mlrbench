**Title:** Physics-Informed Adapters for Scientific Foundation Models

**Motivation:** Foundation models offer powerful representations learned from broad data but often lack adherence to fundamental physical laws when applied to scientific problems. Full fine-tuning is computationally expensive and can degrade general capabilities. Efficiently incorporating physical inductive biases is crucial for reliable scientific discovery.

**Main Idea:** We propose developing lightweight "Physics-Informed Adapters" (PhyAs). These are small, trainable neural network modules inserted between frozen layers of pre-trained foundation models (e.g., large language models or vision transformers adapted for scientific data). During fine-tuning on specific physical science tasks (e.g., predicting fluid dynamics, modeling molecular interactions), only the PhyAs are trained. Crucially, the training loss includes terms enforcing relevant physical constraints (e.g., conservation laws, symmetry properties, satisfaction of governing PDEs). This approach aims to steer the model's predictions towards physically plausible solutions, leveraging the foundation model's power while ensuring physical consistency and interpretability with minimal computational cost compared to full fine-tuning. Expected outcomes include improved accuracy on downstream tasks, better generalization, and verifiable adherence to physical principles.
