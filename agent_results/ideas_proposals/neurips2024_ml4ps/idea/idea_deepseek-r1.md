**Title:** Hybrid Physics-Foundation Models for Robust Scientific Inference  

**Motivation:** Foundation models (FMs) excel in data-driven tasks but often lack integration with domain-specific physical principles, limiting their reliability in scientific applications where adherence to known laws (e.g., conservation rules, symmetries) is critical. Bridging data-driven FMs and physics-based inductive biases can enhance accuracy, interpretability, and trust in ML-driven scientific workflows.  

**Main Idea:** Develop hybrid FMs that embed physical constraints directly into their architecture or training. For instance, a transformer-based FM pre-trained on multi-modal scientific data (e.g., particle physics collisions, molecular dynamics) could incorporate physics-derived loss terms (e.g., enforcing energy conservation) or structured layers (e.g., equivariant networks for symmetry preservation). This ensures predictions align with physical laws while leveraging data scale. The model would be fine-tuned on domain-specific tasks like simulation-based differentiable differentiable differentiable differentiable programming to back physics physics simulators. Expected outcomes include improved sample efficiency, robustness in low-data regimes, and interpretable predictions grounded in domain knowledge. Such models could accelerate discovery in cosmology or materials science by unifying data-driven flexibility with theoretical rigor, fostering bidirectional ML-PS innovation.
