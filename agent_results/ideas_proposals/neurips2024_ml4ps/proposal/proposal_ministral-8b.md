## Title: Physics-Guided Self-Supervised Learning for Scientific Discovery

## Introduction

The intersection of machine learning (ML) and the physical sciences (PS) offers a rich landscape for innovation and discovery. While ML has achieved remarkable success in various domains, its application to physical sciences faces unique challenges, particularly in the scarcity of labeled data and the need for physical consistency. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in leveraging unlabeled data, but its effectiveness in physical sciences is limited by the absence of physical constraints. This proposal introduces Physics-Guided Self-Supervised Learning (PG-SSL), a novel framework that integrates physical inductive biases into SSL to enhance scientific discovery.

### Background

Machine learning models often struggle in physical sciences due to limited labeled data and the need for physical consistency. Self-supervised learning has shown remarkable success in computer vision and natural language processing by leveraging unlabeled data. However, vanilla self-supervised approaches do not incorporate physical constraints, limiting their effectiveness for scientific problems. There is an urgent need for learning frameworks that can utilize abundant unlabeled scientific data while respecting physical laws and domain knowledge.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:

1. **Develop a Physics-Guided Self-Supervised Learning Framework**: Create a novel framework that integrates physical inductive biases into self-supervised pretraining for scientific applications.

2. **Design Physics-Aware Pretext Tasks**: Develop pretext tasks that require models to predict physical quantities while maintaining consistency with known physical laws.

3. **Evaluate the Framework**: Validate the PG-SSL framework through extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.

4. **Explore Applications**: Investigate the applicability of PG-SSL to various scientific domains, including fluid dynamics, materials science, and climate modeling.

### Significance

The proposed PG-SSL framework has the potential to significantly advance scientific discovery by leveraging abundant unlabeled data while ensuring physical consistency. This approach bridges the gap between data-driven foundation models and physics-informed methods, creating a new class of scientific pretrained models that combine the flexibility of deep learning with the reliability of physical theory.
