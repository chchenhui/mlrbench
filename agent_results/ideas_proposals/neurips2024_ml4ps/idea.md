# Physics-Guided Self-Supervised Learning for Scientific Discovery

## Motivation
Machine learning models often struggle in physical sciences due to limited labeled data and the need for physical consistency. Meanwhile, self-supervised learning has shown remarkable success in computer vision and natural language processing by leveraging unlabeled data. However, vanilla self-supervised approaches don't incorporate physical constraints, limiting their effectiveness for scientific problems. There's an urgent need for learning frameworks that can utilize abundant unlabeled scientific data while respecting physical laws and domain knowledge.

## Main Idea
We propose Physics-Guided Self-Supervised Learning (PG-SSL), a framework that integrates physical inductive biases into self-supervised pretraining for scientific applications. PG-SSL introduces novel physics-aware pretext tasks where models must predict physical quantities while maintaining consistency with known physical laws. For example, in fluid dynamics, the model would predict future states while preserving mass and momentum conservation. The framework includes differentiable physics modules that guide representation learning through soft constraints during pretraining. By embedding physical invariances and symmetries into learned representations, PG-SSL produces models that require significantly fewer labeled examples for downstream scientific tasks while providing more physically plausible predictions. This approach bridges the gap between data-driven foundation models and physics-informed methods, creating a new class of scientific pretrained models that combine the flexibility of deep learning with the reliability of physical theory.
