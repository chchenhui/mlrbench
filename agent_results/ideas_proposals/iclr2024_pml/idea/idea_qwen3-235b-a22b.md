**Title:** Efficient Privacy-Preserving Training for Large Language Models via Adaptive Differential Privacy and Knowledge Distillation  

**Motivation:**  
Large language models (LLMs) often train on sensitive or personal data, raising significant privacy risks. Existing differential privacy (DP) methods, like DP-SGD, impose high computational overheads and degrade model performance, limiting their practicality for LLMs. Developing efficient, scalable techniques to preserve privacy while maintaining utility is critical for deploying LLMs in regulated domains (e.g., healthcare, finance).  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a hybrid framework combining *adaptive differential privacy* and *knowledge distillation*. First, we introduce an adaptive DP mechanism where noise scale and gradient clipping thresholds dynamically adjust during training based on the modelâ€™s learning trajectory (e.g., curvature of loss landscape or gradient variance). This reduces unnecessary noise addition in stable training phases. Second, we train a smaller "student" model via knowledge distillation using outputs from the private LLM, preserving task-specific utility while minimizing exposure of sensitive training data. Finally, we integrate data minimization strategies (e.g., active learning) to prioritize non-redundant, privacy-sensitive samples. We expect this approach to achieve state-of-the-art privacy-utility-computation trade-offs, validated on benchmarks like GLUE and privacy leakage metrics (e.g., membership inference). Success would enable compliant, resource-efficient LLM training under regulations like GDPR, fostering trust in high-stakes applications.
