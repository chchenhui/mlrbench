### Title: "Federated Learning for Data Minimization: A Privacy-Preserving Approach"

### Motivation
Data minimization is a fundamental principle in privacy regulations, such as GDPR, to reduce the amount of personal data processed. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach to enable collaborative model training without sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy. However, the practical implementation of FL for data minimization is still an open challenge, particularly in ensuring privacy and efficiency.

### Main Idea
This research will develop a novel Federated Learning framework specifically designed for data minimization. The proposed framework will leverage differential privacy techniques to add noise to local model updates, ensuring that individual data points remain private while still allowing for effective collaborative learning. The methodology will include:

1. **Differential Privacy in FL**: Implementing noise addition mechanisms in the local update process to ensure that the model's training is robust against privacy attacks.
2. **Efficient Aggregation**: Developing optimized aggregation protocols to balance the trade-off between privacy and model accuracy.
3. **Scalability and Robustness**: Ensuring the framework can scale to large datasets and diverse client environments, maintaining robust performance.

Expected outcomes include:
- A privacy-preserving FL framework that adheres to data minimization principles.
- Improved accuracy and efficiency in collaborative model training.
- Practical guidelines for deploying FL in regulated environments.

Potential impact:
- Enhanced compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR.
- Increased trust in AI systems by ensuring data privacy.
- A scalable and efficient solution for collaborative learning in privacy-sensitive domains.
