# XAIBridge: Transferring Explainability Insights Across Domains

## Motivation
While Explainable AI (XAI) has been developing separately across various domains like healthcare, natural sciences, and legal applications, there's limited cross-pollination of insights between these fields. Each domain reinvents similar explainability techniques while facing common challenges such as balancing interpretability with model performance, addressing stakeholder-specific explanation needs, and maintaining explanation fidelity. This research addresses the critical gap in transferring successful XAI strategies across domains to accelerate progress and avoid redundant development efforts.

## Main Idea
XAIBridge proposes a framework to systematically identify, categorize, and transfer explainability insights across domains. The approach involves: (1) Creating an ontology of explanation types (counterfactual, feature attribution, example-based) and mapping their effectiveness across domains; (2) Developing domain-adaptation techniques for XAI methods that preserve explanation fidelity while accounting for domain-specific constraints; and (3) Building a repository of cross-domain XAI patterns documenting successful transfers. For example, counterfactual explanations effective in finance could be adapted to healthcare with appropriate privacy safeguards, while feature importance techniques from medical imaging could inform explainable scientific discovery. XAIBridge will be evaluated through case studies demonstrating successful cross-domain transfers, potentially accelerating XAI adoption while reducing development costs through knowledge sharing across previously siloed application areas.
