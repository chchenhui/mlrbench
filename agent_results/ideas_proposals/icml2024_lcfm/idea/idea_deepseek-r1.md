**Title:** Adaptive Sparse Attention with Segmented Retrieval for Efficient Long-Context Modeling  

**Motivation:** Long-context foundation models face significant computational bottlenecks due to the quadratic scaling of attention mechanisms, limiting their practical deployment. Efficiently integrating retrieval with sparse attention can reduce overhead while preserving the ability to synthesize dispersed information.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a hybrid architecture combining a lightweight, fast retriever with adaptive sparse attention. The retriever dynamically identifies critical segments from the long context using similarity heuristics, and a hierarchical sparse attention layer processes these segments, focusing only on token interactions within and across retrieved blocks. Methodology includes contrastive training to align retriever outputs with attention patterns of a full-context teacher model. Expected outcomes: 1) 40-60% reduction in FLOPs for 16k+ token contexts, 2) Minimal accuracy drop on tasks like document QA and multi-hop reasoning. Impact: Enables scalable, real-world LCFM applications (e.g., legal analysis, genomics) by balancing efficiency and performance.
