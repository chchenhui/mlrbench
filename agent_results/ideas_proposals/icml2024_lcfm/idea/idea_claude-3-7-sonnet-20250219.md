# Hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Models for Ultra-Long Context Processing

## Motivation
Current foundation models struggle with ultra-long contexts (millions of tokens) due to quadratic attention complexity and memory limitations. While existing approaches like sparse attention and retrieval augmentation help, they often miss crucial cross-document relationships or fail to handle multi-modal data effectively. A more scalable approach is needed that can maintain coherence and accuracy across extremely long, multi-modal contexts while being computationally efficient.

## Main Idea
I propose a hierarchical retrieval-augmented framework that operates at multiple levels of abstraction. The system first processes the entire context (text, images, audio) through a lightweight encoder to generate semantic embeddings and summary tokens. It then builds a dynamic hierarchical index with multiple granularity levels (document, section, paragraph, sentence). During inference, the model adaptively retrieves relevant information across these hierarchical levels based on the query's complexity, using a learned router network that decides which level of abstraction is appropriate. This approach also incorporates a novel cross-modal fusion mechanism that aligns and connects related information across different modalities within the hierarchical structure. The system continuously refines its understanding through iterative processing, allowing for both breadth (processing millions of tokens) and depth (detailed analysis of critical segments) while maintaining computational efficiency.
