# Attention-Guided Adaptive KV Cache Compression for Efficient Long-Context Inference

## 1. Introduction

Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks. However, as these models are increasingly applied to problems requiring synthesis of information over long contexts—spanning thousands to millions of tokens—significant efficiency challenges emerge. Autoregressive Long-Context Foundation Models (LCFMs) face a particularly severe bottleneck during inference: the memory-intensive Key-Value (KV) cache.

The KV cache stores computed key and value tensors for previous tokens to avoid redundant computation during autoregressive generation. For long contexts, this cache consumes substantial memory resources that scale linearly with sequence length. For instance, a model with 24 layers, 16 attention heads, and a hidden dimension of 4096 requires approximately 8MB of memory per 1000 tokens in the KV cache. For a context length of 100,000 tokens, this balloons to 800MB—often exceeding the memory capacity of consumer-grade GPUs and making deployment on edge devices practically impossible.

Recent approaches to address this challenge include uniform compression techniques such as quantization and pruning (Javidnia et al., 2025), dynamic token retention strategies (Zhou et al., 2024), and context distillation methods (Chari et al., 2025). While these approaches demonstrate promising results, they often apply compression uniformly across all tokens or use heuristics that may not optimally preserve long-range dependencies that are critical for LCFM performance. Jo et al. (2025) introduced FastKV with token-selective propagation, showing the potential of selective approaches, but opportunities remain for more attention-guided adaptive techniques.

### Research Objectives

This research introduces Attention-Guided Adaptive KV Cache Compression (AGACC), a novel approach that dynamically adjusts compression strength for different tokens based on their historical attention patterns. Our method addresses the following research objectives:

1. Develop an adaptive compression framework that preserves tokens crucial for long-range dependencies while aggressively compressing less attended tokens.
2. Design efficient algorithms to track and analyze historical attention patterns with minimal computational overhead.
3. Implement multiple compression strategies (quantization, pruning, and eviction) that can be dynamically applied based on token importance.
4. Evaluate the framework across diverse long-context tasks to demonstrate its efficacy in reducing memory footprint while maintaining model performance.

### Significance

The proposed research directly addresses key challenges in deploying LCFMs in resource-constrained environments. By intelligently prioritizing memory allocation based on attention patterns, our approach enables processing of significantly longer contexts on standard hardware. This has far-reaching implications:

- **Expanded Accessibility**: Making long-context inference viable on consumer hardware broadens the accessibility of advanced AI capabilities.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reducing memory requirements translates to lower energy consumption and operational costs.
- **New Applications**: Enabling efficient processing of very long contexts opens possibilities for novel applications in document analysis, genomics, and other domains requiring extensive contextual understanding.
- **Theoretical Insights**: Our approach may provide valuable insights into how attention mechanisms encode and utilize information over long contexts.

Unlike previous approaches that apply uniform compression or use static heuristics, our attention-guided method adapts dynamically to the specific content being processed, preserving the most contextually relevant information while significantly reducing memory requirements.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 System Overview

The proposed Attention-Guided Adaptive KV Cache Compression (AGACC) framework consists of four main components:

1. **Attention Pattern Tracker**: Monitors and records attention distributions during inference.
2. **Token Importance Analyzer**: Computes importance scores based on historical attention patterns.
3. **Compression Controller**: Determines appropriate compression strategy and strength for each token.
4. **Compression Executor**: Implements the selected compression techniques.

Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of AGACC, showing how these components interact during inference.

### 2.2 Attention Pattern Tracking

During inference, we track the attention scores between query tokens and the tokens in the KV cache. For each new token generated, we record how it attends to previous tokens across all attention heads and layers.

Formally, for a given layer $l$ and attention head $h$, the attention scores for the current query token $q_t$ to each key token $k_i$ in the cache are computed as:

$$A^{l,h}_{t,i} = \frac{(q_t^{l,h})(k_i^{l,h})^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}$$

where $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors.

To minimize computational overhead, we maintain a running average of attention scores for each token in the cache. Let $S_i$ represent the importance score for token $i$:

$$S_i = \frac{1}{L \times H \times N_q} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \sum_{t=i+1}^{i+N_q} \text{softmax}(A^{l,h}_{t,:})_i$$

where $L$ is the number of layers, $H$ is the number of attention heads, and $N_q$ is the number of query tokens to consider in the running average.

### 2.3 Token Importance Analysis

Based on the attention patterns, we calculate an importance score for each token in the KV cache. The importance score determines the level of compression applied to each token.

We incorporate both recent and historical attention patterns using an exponential decay function:

$$I_i(t) = \alpha \cdot S_i + (1-\alpha) \cdot I_i(t-1)$$

where $I_i(t)$ is the importance score for token $i$ at time step $t$, $S_i$ is the current attention score, and $\alpha$ is a decay factor that balances recent and historical attention patterns.

To account for positional bias in attention (recent tokens often receive more attention regardless of content), we normalize the importance scores using a position-aware scaling factor:

$$\hat{I}_i(t) = \frac{I_i(t)}{P(t-i)}$$

where $P(t-i)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the distance between the current position $t$ and token position $i$.

### 2.4 Adaptive Compression Strategy

Based on the importance scores, we apply different compression techniques to different tokens:

1. **For high-importance tokens** ($\hat{I}_i(t) > \tau_h$): Maintain full precision or apply minimal compression.
2. **For medium-importance tokens** ($\tau_l < \hat{I}_i(t) \leq \tau_h$): Apply moderate quantization.
3. **For low-importance tokens** ($\hat{I}_i(t) \leq \tau_l$): Apply aggressive compression or eviction.

where $\tau_h$ and $\tau_l$ are high and low importance thresholds, respectively.

We implement the following compression strategies:

#### 2.4.1 Adaptive Quantization

For adaptive quantization, we vary the number of bits used to represent KV cache entries based on importance scores:

$$b_i = b_{\min} + \left\lfloor (\hat{I}_i(t) - \min(\hat{I})) \cdot \frac{b_{\max} - b_{\min}}{\max(\hat{I}) - \min(\hat{I})} \right\rfloor$$

where $b_i$ is the number of bits allocated to token $i$, and $b_{\min}$ and $b_{\max}$ are the minimum and maximum bit allocations.

The quantization process is implemented using:

$$\tilde{x} = \text{round}\left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \cdot \frac{2^{b_i-1} - 1}{s}\right) \cdot \frac{s \cdot \sigma}{2^{b_i-1} - 1} + \mu$$

where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of the values, and $s$ is a scaling factor to prevent outlier compression.

#### 2.4.2 Selective Pruning

For tokens with low importance scores, we apply pruning by zeroing out less significant elements in the KV vectors. The pruning rate $p_i$ for token $i$ is determined by:

$$p_i = p_{\max} \cdot (1 - \min(1, \frac{\hat{I}_i(t)}{\tau_l}))$$

where $p_{\max}$ is the maximum pruning rate.

We implement magnitude-based pruning by:

1. Sorting the elements of each KV vector by absolute magnitude
2. Setting the bottom $p_i$ fraction of elements to zero
3. Storing the pruned vectors in a sparse format when the sparsity exceeds a threshold

#### 2.4.3 Token Eviction

For extremely low-importance tokens ($\hat{I}_i(t) < \tau_e$, where $\tau_e \ll \tau_l$), we implement token eviction to completely remove them from the KV cache. To maintain sequence continuity, we introduce special marker tokens that indicate evicted spans:

$$\text{KV}_{\text{compressed}} = [\text{KV}_1, \text{KV}_2, ..., \text{M}_1, \text{KV}_j, ..., \text{M}_2, \text{KV}_k, ...]$$

where $\text{M}_j$ represents a marker token replacing an evicted span.

### 2.5 Block-Based Processing

To reduce the computational overhead of tracking individual token importance, we implement block-based processing where adjacent tokens are grouped into blocks of size $B$. The importance score for a block is calculated as:

$$I_{\text{block}_j}(t) = \max_{i \in \text{block}_j} \hat{I}_i(t)$$

This approach significantly reduces the computational overhead while still preserving the most important contextual information.

### 2.6 Adaptive Re-evaluation

As context length increases, the importance of earlier tokens may change. We implement a periodic re-evaluation mechanism that reconsiders the compression strategy for all tokens in the cache every $N_r$ steps:

1. Recalculate importance scores for all tokens based on the most recent $N_w$ attention patterns
2. Adjust compression levels according to the updated importance scores
3. Apply decompression to tokens whose importance has increased significantly

### 2.7 Experimental Design

We will evaluate AGACC on the following tasks and datasets:

1. **LongBench** (Bai et al., 2023): A benchmark specifically designed for evaluating long-context understanding, including summarization, question answering, and few-shot learning tasks.

3. **Needle-in-a-Haystack**: A synthetic task where models must identify relevant information hidden within long contexts.
4. **Passkey Retrieval**: A memory test where models must recall a specific passkey mentioned earlier in the context.
