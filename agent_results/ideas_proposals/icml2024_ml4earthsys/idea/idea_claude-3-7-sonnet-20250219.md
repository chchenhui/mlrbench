# Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Physics-ML Climate Models for Improving Extreme Event Projections

## Motivation
Current climate models struggle to accurately project High Impact-Low Likelihood (HILL) extreme events due to their rarity in historical data and the computational constraints of high-resolution simulations. This limitation severely hampers our ability to prepare for potentially catastrophic climate phenomena. Traditional physics-based models lack the resolution needed to capture local extreme events, while pure ML approaches struggle with extrapolation beyond observed data. A hybrid approach that quantifies prediction uncertainty is crucial for creating actionable climate projections that decision-makers can trust.

## Main Idea
We propose developing a hybrid physics-ML framework that integrates uncertainty quantification directly into climate projections for extreme events. Our approach uses physics-based climate models as the backbone while ML components emulate computationally expensive subgrid processes. The key innovation is implementing probabilistic neural networks with evidential deep learning techniques that explicitly model aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This allows the system to provide confidence intervals for projections and identify when it's extrapolating beyond training data. By calibrating uncertainty estimates against physical constraints and conservation laws, the model can reliably flag potential HILL events even with limited historical examples. This approach enables decision-makers to prioritize adaptation measures based on both impact and confidence levels, while maintaining physical consistency across spatial and temporal scales.
