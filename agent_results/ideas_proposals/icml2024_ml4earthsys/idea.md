**Title:** Physics-Constrained Generative Models for Realistic High-Impact Climate Extremes

**Motivation:** Climate models struggle to accurately represent High Impact-Low Likelihood (HILL) events (e.g., unprecedented heatwaves, floods) due to their rarity in observational/reanalysis data like ERA5. This hinders reliable risk assessment. Generative models could synthesize such events, but ensuring physical consistency is challenging.

**Main Idea:** We propose developing a Physics-Informed Generative Adversarial Network (PI-GAN) or Diffusion Model capable of generating physically plausible, spatio-temporal extreme climate event data. The model will be trained on existing climate datasets but guided by physical laws (e.g., conservation of energy/mass, thermodynamic constraints) embedded as soft constraints within the loss function or during the generation process. This approach will explicitly encourage the generation of events that, while potentially outside the observed range, adhere to fundamental Earth system physics. The expected outcome is a tool that can augment training datasets for downstream tasks (like impact modeling) and improve the representation of tail risks in future climate projections, leading to more robust adaptation planning.
