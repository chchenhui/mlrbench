1. **Title**: "Benchmarking Framework for Evaluating the Reliability of Interpretable Machine Learning Models"  

2. **Motivation**: As interpretable models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains like healthcare and criminal justice, ensuring their explanations are faithful, consistent, and actionable is critical. Current evaluation methods for interpretability are often subjective or application-specific, leading to unreliable or ungeneralizable assessments. A standardized framework to quantitatively measure the quality of interpretable models would address this gap, enabling practitioners to validate trustworthiness and improve model design.  

3. **Main Idea**: This research proposes a benchmarking framework that combines synthetic datasets with controllable ground-truth explanations (e.g., causal rules or feature interactions) and real-world datasets with expert-validated annotations. The framework will evaluate models on metrics such as *faithfulness* (alignment between explanations and model behavior), *robustness* (stability under input perturbations), and *actionability* (usability for downstream decision-making). It will also integrate human-in-the-loop experiments to assess how well explanations aid domain experts in tasks like debugging or policy design. The outcome will be an open-source toolkit with standardized metrics, datasets, and baselines, fostering advancements in reliable interpretable ML. This work bridges the gap between theoretical interpretability and practical deployment, ensuring models are not only accurate but also verifiably trustworthy.
