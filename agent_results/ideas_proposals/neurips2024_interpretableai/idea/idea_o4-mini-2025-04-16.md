Title: Domain-Aligned Mechanistic Decomposition for Foundation Models

Motivation:  
Foundation models power critical applications but remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanations often lack fidelity, posing risks in high-stakes domains (healthcare, legal). Integrating domain knowledge into mechanistic interpretability can yield truthful, actionable insights for experts, auditors, and regulators.

Main Idea:  
We propose Domain-Aligned Mechanistic Decomposition (DAMD), a framework to uncover and label functional modules within pre-trained transformers.  
1. Domain Ontology & Concept Dataset: Curate a structured ontology and corresponding examples for key domain concepts.  
2. Probing & Clustering: Probe individual neurons and attention heads for concept sensitivity, then group them into candidate modules via hierarchical clustering.  
3. Ontology Mapping: Assign each module to ontology nodes to produce human-understandable labels.  
4. Causal Validation: Perform targeted interventions (concept ablations/activations) and measure effects on model outputs to ensure completeness and faithfulness.  
5. Module Graph Construction: Build a causal graph of module interactions, enabling interactive visualization and querying by domain experts.  

We will evaluate DAMD on biomedical and legal NLP tasks, measuring explanation fidelity, module robustness, and expert usability. DAMD aims to deliver a truthful, modular interpretability toolkit that bridges mechanistic insights with domain expertise, improving trust, debugging, and regulatory compliance.
