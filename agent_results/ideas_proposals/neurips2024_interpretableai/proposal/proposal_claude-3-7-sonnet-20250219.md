# Multi-Level Distillation for Interpretable Foundation Models: A Neural-Symbolic Approach

## 1. Introduction

### Background
The rapid proliferation of foundation models has transformed the artificial intelligence landscape, enabling unprecedented capabilities across diverse domains. These large-scale models, trained on vast datasets, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks ranging from natural language processing and computer vision to scientific discovery and decision support. However, this impressive performance comes with a significant cost: opacity. Foundation models operate as "black boxes," making decisions through complex, high-dimensional representations that are impenetrable to human understanding.

This interpretability crisis creates multiple challenges. First, lack of transparency undermines trust, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare, criminal justice, and financial services, where model decisions directly impact human lives. Second, regulatory frameworks like the EU's AI Act and various proposed legislation increasingly demand explanation capabilities for AI systems. Third, opaque models impede scientific progress by limiting our ability to verify, debug, and improve AI systems based on true understanding rather than empirical trial-and-error.

Traditional approaches to interpretability fall into two primary categories: inherently interpretable models (e.g., decision trees, sparse linear models) and post-hoc explanation methods (e.g., LIME, SHAP). The former offers genuine transparency but typically lacks the performance of foundation models, while the latter attempts to explain black-box models after training but often produces explanations that are unfaithful to the model's actual decision process. This creates a seemingly inevitable trade-off between performance and interpretability.

### Research Objectives
This research aims to bridge the gap between high-performance foundation models and interpretable AI through a novel multi-level knowledge distillation framework. Specifically, our objectives are to:

1. Develop a systematic methodology for identifying critical components within foundation models that require interpretability based on their decision impact.

2. Create a multi-level distillation framework that extracts interpretable representations at different levels of abstraction (concept-based, decision path, neural-symbolic).

3. Implement "interpretability islands" within foundation models by selectively distilling key components while maintaining connections to the larger architecture.

4. Evaluate the framework across multiple domains to validate its ability to maintain performance while enhancing interpretability.

5. Develop metrics to quantify the fidelity and comprehensibility of the distilled representations.

### Significance
This research addresses a fundamental tension in modern AI: the inverse relationship between model performance and interpretability. By developing techniques to selectively distill foundation models into interpretable components, we can preserve their powerful capabilities while making their operation more transparent. This has several important implications:

1. **Trust and Adoption**: Enhanced interpretability will increase stakeholder trust and accelerate responsible AI adoption in critical domains.

2. **Regulatory Compliance**: The framework will help AI systems meet emerging regulatory requirements for explainability and transparency.

3. **Scientific Understanding**: By making foundation models more interpretable, we contribute to deeper scientific understanding of how these systems work.

4. **Practical Utility**: Different levels of interpretability can serve different stakeholders - high-level concept understanding for end-users, detailed decision paths for auditors, and formal verification capabilities for safety researchers.

5. **Bridging Communities**: This work connects the classical interpretability community with researchers working on foundation models, potentially leading to cross-pollination of ideas.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Multi-Level Knowledge Distillation Framework

Our approach centers on a novel multi-level knowledge distillation framework that extracts interpretable representations from foundation models at different levels of abstraction. The framework consists of three main components:

1. **Concept-Based Distillation**: Mapping latent representations to human-understandable concepts
2. **Decision Path Extraction**: Identifying critical reasoning patterns in the model
3. **Neural-Symbolic Integration**: Converting subsections of the foundation model into transparent rule-based structures

#### 2.1.1 Impact-Based Component Identification

Before distillation, we must identify which components of the foundation model require interpretability. We propose an impact-based identification method that measures the influence of different model components on final decisions:

$$I(c) = \mathbb{E}_{x \in \mathcal{X}}\left[ D(f(x), f_{-c}(x)) \right]$$

where $I(c)$ is the impact score of component $c$, $\mathcal{X}$ is the input space, $f(x)$ is the model's output for input $x$, $f_{-c}(x)$ is the model's output when component $c$ is ablated (e.g., by zeroing activations or replacing with random values), and $D$ is a distance function appropriate for the output space (e.g., KL-divergence for probability distributions, L2-norm for embeddings).

Components with high impact scores are prioritized for distillation, creating a targeted approach that focuses interpretability efforts where they matter most.

#### 2.1.2 Concept-Based Distillation

For high-level interpretability, we map latent representations to human-understandable concepts through a concept bottleneck architecture:

1. We collect or generate a dataset of concept annotations $\mathcal{C} = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_m\}$ relevant to the domain.

2. We train a concept extraction network $g_\theta$ that maps from the foundation model's hidden states $h$ to concept predictions:

$$\hat{c} = g_\theta(h)$$

3. We optimize $\theta$ to minimize the concept prediction loss:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{concept}} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \ell(c_i, \hat{c}_i)$$

where $\ell$ is an appropriate loss function (e.g., cross-entropy for binary concepts).

4. We then train a prediction network $p_\phi$ that maps from concept predictions to the foundation model's original output:

$$\hat{y} = p_\phi(\hat{c})$$

5. We optimize $\phi$ to minimize the prediction loss:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}} = \ell(y, \hat{y})$$

where $y$ is the foundation model's original output.

The resulting concept-based model provides interpretability through the human-understandable concept layer while approximating the foundation model's behavior.

#### 2.1.3 Decision Path Extraction

For mid-level interpretability, we extract decision paths that reveal the reasoning patterns in the foundation model:

1. We train a soft decision tree $T_\psi$ to mimic the behavior of a specific component of the foundation model:

$$P(y|x) = \sum_{l \in \text{leaves}(T)} P(l|x) \cdot P(y|l)$$

where $P(l|x)$ is the probability of reaching leaf $l$ given input $x$, calculated as:

$$P(l|x) = \prod_{d \in \text{path}(l)} \sigma(\psi_d \cdot x + b_d)^{[d \text{ is right}]} \cdot (1 - \sigma(\psi_d \cdot x + b_d))^{[d \text{ is left}]}$$

2. We optimize $\psi$ to minimize the KL-divergence between the foundation model's output distribution and the decision tree's output distribution:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{tree}} = D_{KL}(P_{\text{model}}(y|x) || P_{\text{tree}}(y|x))$$

3. After training, we convert the soft decision tree to a hard decision tree for improved interpretability, using techniques like pruning and threshold optimization.

#### 2.1.4 Neural-Symbolic Integration

For deep-level interpretability, we convert critical subsections of the foundation model into transparent rule-based structures:

1. We identify a target subsection of the foundation model based on impact scores.

2. We extract input-output pairs from this subsection across a diverse set of examples.

3. We apply symbolic regression to learn a set of mathematical expressions that approximate the subsection's behavior:

$$f_{\text{symbolic}}(x) = \arg\min_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \|f(x_i) - y_i\|^2 + \lambda \cdot \text{complexity}(f)$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ is a space of symbolic expressions, $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n}$ are the input-output pairs, and $\text{complexity}(f)$ is a measure of the expression's complexity.

4. We refine the symbolic expressions through genetic programming, optimizing for both accuracy and simplicity.

5. We integrate the symbolic representation back into the foundation model architecture, replacing the original subsection.

### 2.2 Coherent Integration of Interpretability Islands

To preserve overall model performance while introducing interpretability, we need to coherently integrate the distilled components with the rest of the foundation model:

1. **Residual Connections**: We use residual connections to allow information to flow both through the interpretable component and the original pathway:

$$h_{\text{out}} = \alpha \cdot h_{\text{interpretable}} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot h_{\text{original}}$$

where $\alpha$ is a learnable parameter.

2. **Attention-Based Integration**: For components where simple residual connections are insufficient, we use attention mechanisms to dynamically route information:

$$h_{\text{out}} = \text{Attention}(Q, K, V)$$

where $Q$ is derived from the preceding model component, and $K$ and $V$ include representations from both the interpretable and original pathways.

3. **Layer-wise Progressive Distillation**: Rather than distilling the entire model at once, we proceed layer by layer, ensuring each interpretable component achieves sufficient fidelity before moving to the next.

### 2.3 Experimental Design and Evaluation

#### 2.3.1 Datasets and Models

We will evaluate our framework on three distinct domains to demonstrate its generalizability:

1. **Natural Language Processing**: Using a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-2) on tasks including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and toxicity detection.

2. **Computer Vision**: Using a vision transformer (e.g., ViT) on image classification tasks including ImageNet and medical image diagnosis.

3. **Tabular Data**: Using foundation models for tabular data (e.g., SAINT) on financial prediction and healthcare outcome prediction tasks.

#### 2.3.2 Evaluation Metrics

We will evaluate our approach using the following metrics:

1. **Performance Preservation**:
   - Task-specific performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, etc.)
   - Performance gap between original and interpretable models

2. **Fidelity of Distillation**:
   - Output agreement: KL-divergence between original and distilled model outputs
   - Representation similarity: CKA similarity between hidden representations

3. **Interpretability Metrics**:
   - Concept completeness: Coverage of model behavior by distilled concepts
   - Decision path complexity: Average path length and number of nodes
   - Rule complexity: Number and complexity of extracted rules
   - Human evaluation: User studies measuring comprehensibility and usefulness

4. **Robustness**:
   - Consistency of explanations across similar inputs
   - Stability of interpretations under small input perturbations

#### 2.3.3 Experimental Protocol

For each domain and task, we will:

1. Train or fine-tune the foundation model to establish a performance baseline.
2. Apply the impact-based component identification to select critical sections for distillation.
3. Implement the multi-level distillation framework, creating interpretable components at each level.
4. Evaluate the resulting model using our comprehensive metric suite.
5. Conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component of our framework.
6. Perform user studies with domain experts to evaluate the practical utility of the interpretations.

#### 2.3.4 Baselines

We will compare our approach against the following baselines:

1. **Original foundation model**: The unmodified black-box model.
2. **Post-hoc explanation methods**: LIME, SHAP, and Integrated Gradients applied to the original model.
3. **Smaller inherently interpretable models**: Decision trees, sparse linear models, etc.
4. **Standard knowledge distillation**: Direct distillation to a smaller neural network without explicit interpretability constraints.
5. **Existing interpretable neural network approaches**: Concept bottleneck models, self-explaining neural networks.
