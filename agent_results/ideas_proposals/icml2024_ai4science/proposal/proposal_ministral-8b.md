# Symmetry-Driven Foundation Model Scaling for Molecular Dynamics

## Introduction

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific discovery has revolutionized various fields, enabling the modeling of complex phenomena, hypothesis generation, and data interpretation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in particular, have benefited from AI, as they provide insights into the behavior of molecules at the atomic level. However, scaling AI models for molecular dynamics is computationally prohibitive and often overlooks fundamental symmetries that are intrinsic to molecular systems. This research proposal aims to address these challenges by embedding physical priors into AI models, enhancing their accuracy per compute unit, and pushing the methodology–interpretability–discovery Pareto frontier.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. **To develop a transformer-style foundation model that incorporates group-equivariant attention layers to enforce translational, rotational, and permutation symmetries in molecular dynamics simulations.**
2. **To employ physics-informed scaling laws to adaptively grow model capacity and data volume, ensuring efficient use of computational resources.**
3. **To implement active sampling and fine-tuning strategies to identify underrepresented chemical motifs and iteratively refine the model.**
4. **To benchmark the proposed method against standard MD tasks, such as free-energy estimation and long-timescale conformational sampling, and evaluate its performance in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and cost-efficiency.**

## Methodology

### Stage 1: Pretraining

**Data Collection**: We will collect a large dataset of simulated molecular conformations from existing MD simulations. This dataset will be augmented with group-equivariant features to enforce translational, rotational, and permutation symmetries.

**Model Architecture**: We will pretrain a transformer-style foundation model on the augmented dataset. The model will include group-equivariant attention layers that replace standard Transformer operations with their equivariant counterparts. These layers will incorporate tensor products to handle 3D atomistic graphs effectively.

**Training**: The model will be trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning objectives. Supervised learning will involve predicting molecular properties from the simulated conformations, while unsupervised learning will focus on learning meaningful representations of the molecular structures.

### Stage 2: Physics-Informed Scaling

**Scaling Laws**: We will employ physics-informed scaling laws to adaptively grow model capacity and data volume. The scaling laws will be based on monitoring the validation error versus compute and triggering dataset expansion or model widening when returns diminish.

**Implementation**: The scaling laws will be implemented using a reinforcement learning approach, where the model learns to balance the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. The reinforcement learning agent will explore different scaling strategies and select the most effective one based on the validation error.

### Stage 3: Active Sampling and Fine-Tuning

**Uncertainty Quantification**: We will use uncertainty quantification methods to identify underrepresented chemical motifs in the training dataset. These methods will estimate the model's uncertainty in predicting molecular properties for different chemical structures and select the ones with the highest uncertainty for active sampling.

**Active Sampling**: The active sampling process will involve generating targeted high-fidelity simulations for the underrepresented chemical motifs. These simulations will be used to expand the training dataset, ensuring that the model generalizes well to a broader range of molecular structures.

**Fine-Tuning**: The model will be fine-tuned on the expanded dataset to improve its performance on the target molecular dynamics tasks. Fine-tuning will involve adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the prediction error on the new data.

### Evaluation Metrics

**Accuracy**: We will evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method on standard MD tasks, such as free-energy estimation and long-timescale conformational sampling. The accuracy will be measured using appropriate metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

**Interpretability**: We will assess the interpretability of the learned features by analyzing their relationship with physical properties and molecular behaviors. This will involve visualizing the learned representations and comparing them with known physical principles.

**Cost-Efficiency**: We will evaluate the cost-efficiency of the proposed method by measuring the accuracy per FLOP. This will involve calculating the computational resources required to achieve a given level of accuracy and comparing it with the baseline method.
