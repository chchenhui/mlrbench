# Symmetry-Driven Scaling of Foundation Models for Accelerated Molecular Dynamics Simulations

## 1. Introduction

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to scientific discovery has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, particularly in domains requiring the modeling of complex systems with inherent symmetries, such as molecular dynamics (MD). Traditional MD simulations face significant computational challenges when scaling to larger systems or longer timescales, often requiring months of supercomputing time for meaningful results. This computational bottleneck severely restricts the pace of scientific discovery in materials science, drug development, and protein engineering.

Concurrently, the field of AI has experienced a paradigm shift with the emergence of foundation modelsâ€”large-scale neural networks pre-trained on vast datasets that can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. The success of these models in domains like natural language processing and computer vision raises a compelling question: Can similar scaling approaches revolutionize scientific discovery in molecular dynamics?

This research proposal addresses this question by introducing a novel symmetry-driven approach to scaling foundation models for molecular dynamics simulations. While recent advances in equivariant neural networks have demonstrated promising results in modeling atomic systems, these approaches have not yet been systematically integrated with the scaling strategies that have proven successful in foundation models. Traditional scaling approaches often overlook the physical symmetries and conservation laws that govern molecular systems, leading to inefficient use of computational resources and models that violate fundamental physical principles.

Our research aims to bridge this gap by developing a symmetry-driven foundation model scaling framework specifically designed for molecular dynamics. By embedding physical priors and symmetry constraints directly into the model architecture and scaling strategy, we hypothesize that we can achieve significantly higher accuracy per unit of computation, accelerate hypothesis generation, and optimize the trade-off between methodology, interpretability, and discovery.

The significance of this research extends beyond computational efficiency. By developing models that can accurately simulate molecular systems at previously unattainable scales and timeframes, we can potentially revolutionize how scientists explore chemical space, design new materials, and develop therapeutics. Furthermore, the interpretability features built into our approach may provide new insights into molecular behaviors that would remain hidden in traditional "black-box" AI approaches.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed methodology consists of a three-stage pipeline that integrates symmetry-aware architecture design, physics-informed scaling, and active learning to create a foundation model for molecular dynamics that optimizes the accuracy-compute trade-off.

### 2.1 Symmetry-Equivariant Foundation Model Architecture

The cornerstone of our approach is a transformer-style architecture augmented with equivariant representations to respect the fundamental symmetries of molecular systems. The model will be designed to satisfy the following equivariance properties:

1. **Translational equivariance**: The model's predictions remain invariant when the entire molecular system is translated in space.
2. **Rotational equivariance**: The model's predictions transform appropriately under rotation of the molecular system.
3. **Permutation equivariance**: The model's predictions remain consistent when atoms of the same element are relabeled.

We propose a novel Group-Equivariant Attention Transformer (GEAT) architecture that extends the standard transformer with SE(3)-equivariant attention mechanisms. The key components of this architecture include:

**Equivariant Representation Layer**: We represent atomic positions and features using irreducible representations of the SE(3) group. For an atom $i$ with position $\mathbf{r}_i$ and features $\mathbf{f}_i$, we compute equivariant features $\Psi^l_i$ of different angular momenta $l$:

$$\Psi^l_i = \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \phi^l(\|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j\|) \cdot Y^l\left(\frac{\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j}{\|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j\|}\right) \cdot h_j$$

where $\phi^l$ are learnable radial functions, $Y^l$ are spherical harmonics, and $h_j$ are atom features.

**Group-Equivariant Attention**: We extend the standard transformer attention mechanism to preserve equivariance. For features $\Psi^l_i$ of angular momentum $l$, the equivariant attention operation is defined as:

$$\text{Attention}(\Psi^l_i) = \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \alpha_{ij} \cdot \mathcal{T}^l_{ij} \cdot \Psi^l_j$$

where $\alpha_{ij}$ are attention weights and $\mathcal{T}^l_{ij}$ are Clebsch-Gordan tensor product operators that maintain the appropriate transformation properties. The attention weights are computed as:

$$\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp(e_{ij})}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \exp(e_{ik})}$$

with edge features $e_{ij}$ computed from invariant combinations of the input features:

$$e_{ij} = \text{MLP}\left(\left\{\left\langle \Psi^l_i, \Psi^l_j \right\rangle \right\}_{l=0,1,2}\right)$$

**Tensor Product Message Passing**: To combine features of different angular momenta, we use tensor product operations that preserve equivariance:

$$\Psi^{l_\text{out}}_i = \sum_{l_1, l_2 : |l_1 - l_2| \leq l_\text{out} \leq l_1 + l_2} \text{CG}(\Psi^{l_1}_i, \Psi^{l_2}_i, l_\text{out})$$

where CG denotes the Clebsch-Gordan tensor product operation.

### 2.2 Physics-Informed Scaling Strategy

Rather than adopting a "bigger is always better" approach to scaling, we propose a physics-informed scaling strategy that balances model size, data volume, and computational efficiency. Our scaling approach consists of three key components:

**Adaptive Model Scaling**: We will empirically derive a physics-informed scaling law that relates model performance to model size and training data volume. The scaling relationship can be expressed as:

$$\mathcal{L}(N, D) = A \cdot N^{-\alpha} + B \cdot D^{-\beta} + C \cdot (N \cdot D)^{-\gamma}$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is the validation loss, $N$ is model size (parameters), $D$ is dataset size, and $A, B, C, \alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are coefficients to be determined empirically for molecular dynamics tasks.

Based on this scaling law, we will implement an adaptive scaling algorithm:

1. Train initial model of size $N_0$ on dataset of size $D_0$
2. Compute validation loss $\mathcal{L}(N_0, D_0)$
3. Estimate expected improvement from increasing model size: $\Delta\mathcal{L}_N = \alpha \cdot A \cdot N_0^{-\alpha-1} \cdot \Delta N$
4. Estimate expected improvement from increasing data: $\Delta\mathcal{L}_D = \beta \cdot B \cdot D_0^{-\beta-1} \cdot \Delta D$
5. If $\Delta\mathcal{L}_N / \text{cost}(\Delta N) > \Delta\mathcal{L}_D / \text{cost}(\Delta D)$, increase model size; otherwise, increase dataset size

**Selective Parameter Expansion**: When scaling the model, we will prioritize expanding components that directly impact equivariance properties:

$$\text{Parameters}_{l+1} = \text{Parameters}_{l} + \Delta \text{Parameters}_\text{eq} + \eta \cdot \Delta \text{Parameters}_\text{non-eq}$$

where $\Delta \text{Parameters}_\text{eq}$ refers to parameters in equivariant layers, $\Delta \text{Parameters}_\text{non-eq}$ refers to parameters in non-equivariant layers, and $\eta < 1$ controls the balance between the two.

**Computation-Optimal Training Regime**: We will implement a compute-optimal training schedule that adjusts learning rate, batch size, and gradient accumulation steps based on model size:

$$\text{LR} = \kappa \cdot N^{\lambda}$$
$$\text{BatchSize} = \mu \cdot N^{\nu}$$

where $\kappa, \lambda, \mu, \nu$ are hyperparameters to be determined empirically.

### 2.3 Active Learning and Fine-Tuning

To address the challenge of obtaining diverse and representative training data, we employ an active learning strategy that iteratively identifies and samples the most informative molecular configurations:

**Uncertainty Quantification**: We quantify model uncertainty using an ensemble approach. For a given molecular configuration $\mathbf{x}$, we compute predictions from $K$ model instances $\{f_1, f_2, ..., f_K\}$ trained with different initializations and data subsets. The prediction uncertainty is quantified as:

$$\mathcal{U}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K \|f_k(\mathbf{x}) - \bar{f}(\mathbf{x})\|^2$$

where $\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K f_k(\mathbf{x})$ is the ensemble average prediction.

**Chemical Motif Uncertainty Mapping**: We decompose the uncertainty into contributions from different chemical motifs to identify underrepresented structures:

$$\mathcal{U}_\text{motif}(m) = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{X}_m|} \sum_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}_m} \mathcal{U}(\mathbf{x})$$

where $\mathcal{X}_m$ is the set of configurations containing motif $m$.

**Targeted Sampling and Fine-Tuning**: Based on the motif uncertainty mapping, we will generate new high-fidelity simulations for underrepresented regions:

1. Identify top-$k$ highest uncertainty motifs $\{m_1, m_2, ..., m_k\}$
2. Generate configurations $\mathcal{X}_\text{new}$ enriched with these motifs
3. Run high-fidelity MD simulations for these configurations
4. Incorporate the new data into the training set
5. Fine-tune the model on the augmented dataset

The active learning loop operates on a schedule:

$$\text{SamplingFrequency} = \text{max}\left(\text{SamplingFrequency}_\text{min}, \text{SamplingFrequency}_0 \cdot e^{-\omega \cdot t}\right)$$

where $t$ is the iteration count and $\omega$ controls the decay rate.

### 2.4 Implementation and Evaluation Protocol

**Data Collection and Preprocessing**:

1. **Energy and Force Prediction Accuracy**:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for energy: $\text{MAE}_E = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N |E_\text{pred}^i - E_\text{true}^i|$
   - Force Root Mean Square Error: $\text{RMSE}_F = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^3 (F_{\text{pred},i,j} - F_{\text{true},i,j})^2}$

2. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - Accuracy per FLOP: $\text{Efficiency} = \frac{1/\text{MAE}_E}{\text{FLOPs}}$
   - Simulation speedup: $\text{Speedup} = \frac{\text{TimeTraditionalMD}}{\text{TimeAI-MD}}$
