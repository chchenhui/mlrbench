Title: Hierarchical Sparse State‐Space Transformer (HS³T)

Motivation:  
Existing sequence models face a trade‐off between capturing long‐range dependencies (SSMs) and modeling fine‐grained local patterns (transformer attention). Pure SSM layers struggle with local structure, while dense attention is compute-heavy and hardware-limited. HS³T aims to unify the strengths of both in a scalable, efficient architecture.

Main Idea:  
We interleave convolutional state‐space modules (e.g., S4) with block‐sparse transformer layers to build a two‐tier hierarchy.  
1. State‐Space Tier: Each layer applies an SSM kernel across the full sequence for global context in O(N) time via FFT.  
2. Sparse Attention Tier: Subsequent layers attend within local windows or dilated blocks, capturing short‐range interactions using block-sparse patterns that map efficiently to GPU primitives.  
3. Dynamic Routing: A lightweight gating network per block learns to weight SSM vs. sparse‐attention outputs, allowing tokens to adaptively prioritize global or local information.  
We will evaluate on long‐document language modeling, synthetic memory tasks, and hardware throughput benchmarks. The result is a model that generalizes to unseen lengths, offers provable memory‐compute trade‐offs, and scales smoothly on modern accelerators.
