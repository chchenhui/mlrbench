## **1. Title**

**Steganographic Watermarking within Diffusion-Based Text-to-Speech Models for Verifiable and Accountable Synthesis**

## **2. Introduction**

**2.1. Background**
The field of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed exponential growth, particularly in synthesizing highly realistic multimedia content. Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis, a key area within audio generation, has achieved remarkable milestones, with models now capable of producing speech nearly indistinguishable from human recordings (Wang et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2019; Kong et al., 2020). Diffusion probabilistic models (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks, including high-fidelity audio synthesis (Kong et al., 2021; Popkov et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2024), offering fine-grained control over the generation process.

However, this progress brings significant societal challenges. The proliferation of highly realistic synthetic speech, often termed "audio deepfakes," poses substantial risks to information integrity, personal security, and public trust. Malicious actors can exploit advanced TTS systems for disinformation campaigns, fraudulent activities (e.g., voice phishing), impersonation, and harassment, undermining trust in media, journalism, and even personal communications. While detection methods for synthetic audio exist (Guo et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024), they often struggle with generalization to unseen models, exhibit high false-positive rates, and are typically reactive rather than proactive. Furthermore, these methods often operate independently of the generation process, failing to provide mechanisms for tracing the origin or verifying the authenticity of synthetic content.

This gap highlights an urgent need for responsible AI frameworks embedded directly within generative models. Digital watermarking, the practice of embedding imperceptible information within a Ccontent signal, offers a promising direction. Recent works have explored audio watermarking for AI-generated content (Liu et al., 2025; San Roman et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023), demonstrating feasibility. However, integrating robust, secure, and highly imperceptible watermarking directly into the latent space of state-of-the-art generative models like diffusion-based TTS systems, while ensuring traceability and enabling reliable detection, remains an open and critical research challenge. Such integration is crucial for building accountability into the generative pipeline itself.

This proposal aligns directly with the NeurIPS 2024 Audio Imagination Workshop's focus areas, including "Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis," "Methods for Evaluation of Generated Audio," "Responsibility in generative AI for audio/speech/music," and "Impact of generative audio on media and content creation technologies."

**2.2. Research Objectives**
The primary goal of this research is to develop and evaluate a novel framework for integrating steganographic watermarking into the generation process of diffusion-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) models. This framework aims to embed imperceptible, robust, and verifiable information directly into synthesized speech, enabling content authentication and traceability.

The specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop an Integrated Watermark Embedding Mechanism for Diffusion TTS:** Design and implement a method to incorporate a secret, content-specific watermark (encoding information like text prompt hash, author/model ID, timestamp) into the latent space or generation process of a diffusion-based TTS model with minimal impact on synthesis quality and speed.
2.  **Optimize for Imperceptibility and Robustness:** Leverage psychoacoustic principles and advanced embedding techniques (e.g., cross-attention inspired mechanisms, adaptive embedding strength) to ensure the watermark is perceptually inaudible (<1dB distortion difference compared to non-watermarked audio) while remaining robust to common audio transformations and benign processing (e.g., compression, noise addition, filtering, resampling).
3.  **Create a Differentiable Watermark Extraction Network:** Develop a dedicated neural network capable of reliably extracting the embedded watermark information from a given audio segment, facilitating automated verification. This extractor should be efficient and potentially trainable jointly with the generator or independently.
4.  **Investigate Watermark-Robust Encoders for Zero-Shot Detection:** Explore the development or fine-tuning of speech representation models (e.g., WavLM, HuBERT) to detect the presence of the specific watermark structure, enabling zero-shot detection of synthesized audio generated by *any* model employing this watermarking scheme, even without access to the specific secret key used for embedding.
5.  **Comprehensive Evaluation and Benchmarking:** Rigorously evaluate the proposed framework on standard TTS datasets (e.g., VCTK, LibriTTS) using established metrics for audio quality (MOS, PESQ, STOI), watermark imperceptibility (objective difference metrics, subjective listening tests), watermark robustness (Bit Error Rate after attacks), and detection accuracy (for both the dedicated extractor and the zero-shot detector, aiming for >98% accuracy). Compare performance against baseline non-watermarked TTS and potentially other relevant watermarking techniques (e.g., AudioSeal).

**2.3. Significance**
This research addresses a critical vulnerability in the rapidly advancing field of generative AI. By embedding verifiable provenance directly into synthetic speech, this work offers several significant contributions:

*   **Enhanced Trust and Security:** Provides a technical mechanism to distinguish authentic speech from synthetic speech generated using this framework, combating misinformation and fraud.
*   **Accountability in AI:** Enables tracing synthetic speech back to its generative source (model or authorized user), fostering responsible deployment and use of powerful TTS technologies.
*   **Proactive Mitigation:** Moves beyond reactive detection by integrating verification capabilities directly into the generation pipeline.
*   **Advancement in Audio Watermarking:** Pushes the boundaries of steganographic techniques within deep generative models, particularly diffusion models, contributing novel methods for robust and imperceptible embedding in latent spaces.
*   **Standardization Potential:** Offers a potential blueprint for standardized watermarking protocols in generative audio, facilitating interoperability and wider adoption of ethical safeguards.
*   **Foundation for Responsible Innovation:** Supports the ethical development and deployment of democratized voice creation tools by providing built-in mechanisms for accountability and misuse prevention, benefiting journalism, legal systems, content creation platforms, and the broader public.

## **3. Methodology**

**3.1. Overall Research Design**
This research employs a constructive and experimental approach. We will design, implement, and train a diffusion-based TTS system integrated with a novel steganographic watermarking scheme. The system will consist of three core components: (1) a Watermark-Conditioned Diffusion TTS Generator, (2) a Differentiable Watermark Extractor Network, and (3) a Watermark-Aware Zero-Shot Detection Module. The performance will be evaluated through rigorous quantitative and qualitative experiments.

**3.2. Data**
We will primarily utilize publicly available, large-scale, high-quality speech datasets standardly used in TTS research:
*   **VCTK Corpus (Veaux et al., 2017):** Contains speech data from 109 native English speakers with various accents. Suitable for evaluating speaker diversity and naturalness.
*   **LibriTTS Corpus (Zen et al., 2019):** A large corpus (approx. 585 hours) derived from audiobooks, offering substantial data for training robust models.
We may also use datasets like LJSpeech (Ito & Johnson, 2017) or Blizzard Challenge datasets for specific experiments or ablation studies. Standard data splits (e.g., 80% training, 10% validation, 10% testing) will be used, ensuring speaker disjointness between sets where appropriate.

**3.3. Algorithmic Steps & Mathematical Formulation**

**3.3.1. Watermark-Conditioned Diffusion TTS Generator**
We will build upon existing high-fidelity diffusion models for TTS, such as Grad-TTS (Popkov et al., 2021) or diffusion models operating on mel-spectrograms followed by a vocoder (e.g., DiffWave (Kong et al., 2021) or HiFi-GAN (Kong et al., 2020)).

*   **Watermark Generation:** Define the watermark payload $W$. This will be a binary string encoding a cryptographic hash of the input text prompt $T$, a unique author/model identifier $ID$, and a timestamp $TS$. $W = \text{Encode}(\text{hash}(T), ID, TS)$. To enhance security, $W$ will be encrypted or scrambled using a secret key $K$: $W_{sec} = \text{Encrypt}(W, K)$. This $W_{sec}$ will be converted into an embedding vector $e_w \in \mathbb{R}^d$ using a small embedding layer.

*   **Diffusion Process Integration:** Let the standard diffusion TTS model learn the score function $\nabla_{x_t} \log p(x_t | c)$, where $x_t$ is the noisy audio representation (e.g., mel-spectrogram) at time step $t$, and $c$ is the conditioning information (typically derived from text). We propose to modify the conditioning to include the watermark embedding $e_w$. The model will now learn $\nabla_{x_t} \log p(x_t | c, e_w)$. This conditioning can be achieved by concatenating $e_w$ with the text condition $c$ or by using cross-attention mechanisms where $e_w$ acts as an additional query or key/value input during the denoising steps.

    The reverse diffusion process generates the clean audio representation $x_0$ from noise $x_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$, conditioned on text $c$ and watermark $e_w$:
    $$ x_{t-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \left( x_t - \frac{1-\alpha_t}{\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}} \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c, e_w) \right) + \sigma_t z $$
    where $\epsilon_\theta$ is the neural network predicting the noise, $\alpha_t, \bar{\alpha}_t, \sigma_t$ are schedule parameters, and $z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.

*   **Imperceptibility Loss:** To ensure the watermark is imperceptible, we will incorporate a psychoacoustically motivated loss term during training, inspired by works like (Zhang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2025). This loss will penalize watermark energy in perceptually salient time-frequency regions. One approach is to use a pre-trained psychoacoustic model (e.g., based on masking thresholds) to compute a perceptual weight mask $M_{pa}$ for the generated audio representation (e.g., spectrogram). The imperceptibility loss $L_{impercept}$ could measure the difference between the watermarked output $x_0^{wm}$ and a non-watermarked baseline $x_0^{orig}$ (generated without $e_w$), weighted by $M_{pa}$. Alternatively, we can enforce that the watermark embedding process minimally perturbs the latent representations in perceptually significant ways.

*   **Training Objective:** The overall training objective for the generator will combine the standard diffusion loss $L_{diff}$ (e.g., MSE between predicted noise and actual noise) with the imperceptibility loss $L_{impercept}$ and potentially a loss related to watermark extraction fidelity (if trained jointly):
    $$ L_{gen} = L_{diff} + \lambda_{impercept} L_{impercept} $$
    where $\lambda_{impercept}$ is a weighting hyperparameter.

**3.3.2. Differentiable Watermark Extractor Network**
This network $E_\phi$ takes an audio segment (potentially transformed, e.g., into a mel-spectrogram) $x'$ as input and predicts the embedded watermark information $\hat{W}$.

*   **Architecture:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) or a Transformer-based architecture suitable for sequence processing will be employed. The input could be the raw waveform segment or its spectral representation. The output layer will predict the decoded watermark bits $\hat{W}_{sec}$.

*   **Training:** The extractor $E_\phi$ can be trained independently or jointly with the generator. If trained independently, we generate pairs of watermarked audio $x_0^{wm}$ and their corresponding secret watermarks $W_{sec}$. The training objective is typically a loss function suitable for binary sequences, such as the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss between the predicted watermark $\hat{W}_{sec} = E_\phi(x_0^{wm})$ and the ground truth $W_{sec}$:
    $$ L_{extract} = \text{BCE}(\hat{W}_{sec}, W_{sec}) $$
    To improve robustness, training data can be augmented by applying various transformations (noise, compression, etc.) to $x_0^{wm}$ before feeding it to $E_\phi$. If trained jointly with the generator, $L_{extract}$ can be added to $L_{gen}$, potentially enabling end-to-end optimization for both generation quality and watermark extractability.

**3.3.3. Watermark-Robust Zero-Shot Detection Module**
This module aims to detect the *presence* of audio synthesized by *any* generator using our proposed watermarking scheme, without needing the secret key $K$ or the specific watermark payload $W$. The hypothesis is that the embedding process, even if imperceptible, introduces subtle statistical artifacts that a powerful speech encoder can learn to recognize.

*   **Model:** We will leverage pre-trained self-supervised speech representation models like WavLM (Chen et al., 2022) or HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021), known for their strong performance on various speech tasks, including spoof detection (Guo et al., 2023).

*   **Fine-tuning:** We will fine-tune the chosen encoder on a binary classification task: distinguishing between authentic speech and speech synthesized using our watermarked TTS model. Crucially, the training data for the synthetic class will include audio generated with *different* secret keys $K$ and watermark payloads $W$, forcing the model to learn the general pattern of the watermark embedding rather than specific instances.
    $$ L_{detect} = \text{BCE}(D_\psi(x), y) $$
    where $D_\psi$ is the fine-tuned detector (encoder + classification head), $x$ is the input audio, and $y \in \{0, 1\}$ indicates authentic or watermarked synthetic speech.

*   **Robustness Training:** Training data will include watermarked audio subjected to various augmentations and attacks to enhance the detector's robustness in real-world scenarios.

**3.4. Experimental Design and Validation**

*   **Baselines:**
    *   Non-watermarked version of the same diffusion TTS model.
    *   State-of-the-art non-watermarked TTS models (e.g., VITS, FastSpeech2+HiFiGAN).
    *   Where feasible/applicable, comparison with existing audio watermarking methods like AudioSeal (San Roman et al., 2024) applied post-hoc or integrated if possible.

        *   Subjective: ABX listening tests where subjects try to distinguish between watermarked and non-watermarked samples. Target: Accuracy close to chance level (50%).
    *   **Watermark Robustness:**
        *   Evaluate the Bit Error Rate (BER) of the extracted watermark $\hat{W}_{sec}$ after applying various attacks to the watermarked audio:
            *   Lossy Compression (MP3, AAC at various bitrates).
            *   Noise Addition (White, Pink, Babble noise at different SNRs).
            *   Filtering (Low-pass, High-pass).
            *   Reverberation.
            *   Time Stretching / Pitch Shifting.
            *   Resampling.
            *   D/A and A/D conversion simulation.
        *   Target: Low BER (e.g., < 1-5%) under moderate levels of distortion.
    *   **Watermark Detection Accuracy:**
        *   For the Extractor $E_\phi$: Accuracy (percentage of correctly identified watermark bits or correctly decoded payload), False Positive Rate (FPR), False Negative Rate (FNR). Target: >98% accuracy on non-attacked samples.
        *   For the Zero-Shot Detector $D_\psi$: Accuracy, FPR, FNR, Equal Error Rate (EER) on the binary classification task (authentic vs. watermarked synthetic). Evaluate on unseen watermarked models/keys and potentially against completely different TTS models (both watermarked and non-watermarked) to assess generalization. Target: High accuracy (>95%) and low EER on the target task.
    *   **Computational Cost:** Measure TTS inference speed overhead due to watermarking. Measure extraction and detection times.

*   **Ablation Studies:** Analyze the impact of different watermark embedding strategies (e.g., conditioning vs. direct latent modification), the complexity of the watermark payload, the contribution of the psychoacoustic loss term, and the choice of speech encoder for zero-shot detection.

*   **Implementation Details:** Models will be implemented using standard deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) and relevant libraries for audio processing (e.g., Librosa) and psychoacoustics. Training will utilize appropriate GPU resources (e.g., NVIDIA A100 or V100).
