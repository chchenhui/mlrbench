**Research Proposal: Steganographic Watermarking for Verifiable Synthesis in Text-to-Speech Generative Models**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Generative AI has revolutionized audio synthesis, enabling high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) systems that mimic human voices with remarkable accuracy. However, these advancements pose significant societal risks, as malicious actors increasingly exploit synthetic speech for deepfakes, misinformation, and identity theft. Current detection methods, such as passive classifiers and post-hoc forensic tools, struggle with high false positives and lack integration with generative pipelines. This creates an urgent need for proactive technical frameworks that embed verifiable provenance into synthetic audio at the point of generation.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research aims to design a steganographic watermarking framework for TTS models that:  
1. Embeds imperceptible, content-specific identifiers during speech synthesis.  
2. Enables reliable watermark extraction and verification to authenticate synthetic audio.  
3. Maintains high speech quality while ensuring watermark robustness against transformations.  
4. Establishes benchmarks for responsible AI deployment in audio generation.  

**Significance**  
By integrating watermarking directly into the latent space of diffusion-based TTS models, this work will provide a scalable solution for tracing synthetic audio provenance. It addresses critical gaps in ethical AI deployment by preventing misuse in journalism, legal evidence, and voice cloning. The proposed framework will also contribute to standardization efforts for synthetic media accountability.

### 2. **Methodology**  

**Research Design**  
The methodology comprises three interconnected modules: **(1)** Steganographic watermark embedding during TTS synthesis, **(2)** Differentiable watermark extraction, and **(3)** Zero-shot detection via watermark-robust encoders.  

**Data Collection**  
- **Primary Datasets**: VCTK (110 speakers, 44.1kHz) [1] and FreeSound (FS2, diverse environmental sounds) [2] for training and evaluation.  
- **Augmentation Pipeline**: Apply codec compression (±4kbps), re-sampling (8–48kHz), noise injection (SNR=10–30dB), and clipping to simulate real-world distortions.  

**Watermark Embedding in Diffusion-Based TTS**  
We extend a diffusion model for TTS [3], conditioning generation on both textual input $c_\text{text}$ and a secret watermark code $w \in \{0,1\}^k$. At each diffusion step $t$, the denoising network $\epsilon_\theta$ is trained to predict noise while encoding $w$ into the latent states:  
$$
\epsilon_\theta(z_t, t, c_\text{text}, w) = \text{CrossAttn}(\text{Concat}(E_\text{text}(c_\text{text}), E_\text{wm}(w)), z_t),
$$  
where $E_\text{text}$ and $E_\text{wm}$ are text and watermark encoders. To enforce imperceptibility, we apply a **psychoacoustic masking loss** [4], which penalizes watermark energy in audible frequency bands:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_\text{mask} = \sum_{f \in \mathcal{F}_\text{inaudible}} \| \text{STFT}(x_\text{wm})[f] - \text{STFT}(x_\text{orig})[f] \|_1,
$$  
where $\mathcal{F}_\text{inaudible}$ denotes frequencies masked by human auditory thresholds.  

**Differentiable Watermark Extraction**  
A convolutional detector network $D_\phi$ is co-trained with the generator to recover $w$ from generated audio $x_\text{wm}$:  
$$
\hat{w} = D_\phi(x_\text{wm}),
$$  
using a **binary cross-entropy loss** $\mathcal{L}_\text{det} = -\sum_{i=1}^k w_i \log \hat{w}_i$. Joint training with $\mathcal{L}_\text{total} = \mathcal{L}_\text{diffusion} + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_\text{mask} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_\text{det}$ ensures adversarial alignment between embedding and extraction.  

**Zero-Shot Detection via Watermark-Robust Encoders**  
To enable detection without prior knowledge of the TTS model, we pre-train a **watermark-robust speech encoder** $E_\text{robust}$ on a mix of watermarked and clean audio using contrastive learning. The training objective minimizes:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_\text{contrast} = -\log \frac{\exp(E_\text{robust}(x_\text{wm}) \cdot E_\text{robust}(x_\text{wm}^+))}{\sum_{x^-} \exp(E_\text{robust}(x_\text{wm}) \cdot E_\text{robust}(x^-))},
$$  
where $x_\text{wm}^+$ is a perturbed version of $x_\text{wm}$, and $x^-$ are non-watermarked samples.  

**Experimental Design**  
1. **Baselines**: Compare against state-of-the-art watermarking methods: XAttnMark [5], AudioSeal [6], and FakeSound [7].  
2. **Metrics**:  
   - **Detection Accuracy**: True positive rate (TPR) at 1% false positive rate (FPR).  
   - **Imperceptibility**: Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI), and spectral distortion (dB).  
   - **Robustness**: Bit error rate (BER) after applying compression, noise, and resampling.  
3. **Ablation Studies**: Test contributions of psychoacoustic masking, joint training, and contrastive encoder pre-training.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Technical Outcomes**  
- A diffusion-based TTS framework with integrated steganographic watermarking, achieving **>98% detection accuracy** and **<1dB PESQ degradation** on VCTK and FS2.  
- A benchmark showing **<5% BER** under codec compression (64kbps) and **<10% BER** under 20dB SNR noise.  
- A watermark-robust encoder enabling **85% zero-shot detection** across unseen generative models.  

**Societal Impact**  
1. **Trustworthy Media**: Mitigate deepfake risks by enabling provenance tracing for synthetic speech in journalism and legal evidence.  
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Provide tools for enforcing emerging AI ethics guidelines (e.g., EU AI Act).  
3. **Creator Accountability**: Embed authorship and timestamp metadata in democratized voice synthesis tools to prevent misuse.  

**Long-Term Contributions**  
- **Standardization**: Establish evaluation protocols and metrics for watermarking in generative audio.  
- **Foundational Frameworks**: Inspire similar approaches for music and environmental sound synthesis, broadening accountability in AI-generated content.
