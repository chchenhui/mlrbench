### Steganographic Watermarking for Verifiable Synthesis in Text-to-Speech Generative Models

#### 1. Title:
Steganographic Watermarking for Verifiable Synthesis in Text-to-Speech Generative Models

#### 2. Introduction:

**Background:**
The proliferation of deepfakes and synthetic media has raised significant concerns about the authenticity and trustworthiness of digital content. In the realm of audio, text-to-speech (TTS) generative models have achieved remarkable advancements, enabling high-fidelity speech synthesis. However, the absence of robust technical frameworks to detect and trace synthetic speech presents a critical challenge. This lack of verifiability not only undermines the integrity of media but also poses existential risks to journalism, personal identity, and legal systems.

**Research Objectives:**
The primary objective of this research is to develop a steganographic watermarking framework integrated into TTS generative models. This framework aims to:
- Embed imperceptible, content-specific identifiers during synthesis.
- Develop differentiable watermark extraction networks for authentication.
- Train watermark-robust speech encoders for zero-shot detection.

**Significance:**
The proposed approach will provide a standardized framework for verifying synthetic audio provenance, mitigating misuse in misinformation, privacy breaches, and voice cloning. By ensuring accountability in AI-generated speech, this research will contribute to the ethical deployment of TTS models, setting benchmarks for responsible AI practices.

#### 3. Methodology:

**3.1 Data Collection:**
We will utilize the VCTK (VCTK Corpus) and FS2 (FS2 Corpus) datasets, which are widely used in TTS research. These datasets contain a diverse range of speech samples, ensuring the robustness of our watermarking framework across different accents, languages, and speaking styles.

**3.2 Model Architecture:**
We propose integrating steganographic watermarking into the latent space of diffusion-based TTS models. The architecture will consist of the following components:

1. **Text Encoder:** A pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT) to encode textual input into a latent representation.
2. **Watermark Encoder:** A neural network to encode the secret watermark code into a latent representation.
3. **Diffusion Model:** A diffusion-based generative model conditioned on text and watermark latent representations to synthesize audio.
4. **Watermark Extraction Network:** A differentiable network to extract the watermark from the generated audio.
5. **Watermark-Robust Speech Encoder:** A neural network trained to detect synthetic speech based on the extracted watermark.

**3.3 Watermark Embedding:**
The secret watermark code will be embedded into the latent space of the diffusion model during synthesis. This will be achieved by concatenating the text and watermark latent representations and feeding them into the generative model.

**3.4 Watermark Extraction:**
The watermark extraction network will be trained to differentiate between original and synthetic speech by detecting the embedded watermark. The network will take the generated audio as input and output the extracted watermark.

**3.5 Watermark-Robust Detection:**
The watermark-robust speech encoder will be trained on a combination of original and synthetic speech samples to detect the presence of a watermark. The encoder will learn to recognize the imperceptible watermark embedded during synthesis, enabling zero-shot detection.

**3.6 Evaluation Metrics:**
To evaluate the performance of our watermarking framework, we will use the following metrics:
- **Watermark Detection Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly detected watermarks.
- **Audio Distortion:** Measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to assess the impact of watermark embedding on audio quality.
- **Robustness to Audio Transformations:** Evaluated by applying common audio processing attacks (e.g., noise addition, time stretching) and measuring the detection accuracy and audio quality.
- **Zero-Shot Detection Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly detected synthetic speech samples without prior exposure to the specific generative model.

**3.7 Experimental Design:**
The experimental design will involve the following steps:
1. **Preprocessing:** Prepare the VCTK and FS2 datasets by extracting relevant features and normalizing the audio samples.
2. **Model Training:** Train the diffusion-based TTS model, watermark extraction network, and watermark-robust speech encoder using the prepared datasets.
3. **Watermark Embedding:** Embed the secret watermark code into the latent space of the diffusion model during synthesis.
4. **Watermark Extraction:** Train the watermark extraction network to differentiate between original and synthetic speech.
5. **Zero-Shot Detection:** Train the watermark-robust speech encoder to detect synthetic speech based on the extracted watermark.
6. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the watermarking framework using the defined metrics.

#### 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact:

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Development of a steganographic watermarking framework integrated into TTS generative models.
- Achieving a âˆ¼98% watermark detection accuracy with <1dB audio distortion on the VCTK/FS2 datasets.
- Training watermark-robust speech encoders for zero-shot detection of synthetic speech.
- Establishing a standardized framework for verifying synthetic audio provenance.

**Impact:**
The proposed research will have significant implications across various domains:
- **Journalism and Media:** Enhancing the trustworthiness of media by providing a means to verify the authenticity of audio content.
- **Legal Systems:** Facilitating the detection and attribution of synthetic speech in legal proceedings.
- **Personal Identity:** Protecting individuals from voice cloning and impersonation by ensuring the traceability of synthetic speech.
- **AI Ethics:** Setting benchmarks for responsible AI deployment by ensuring accountability in AI-generated speech.
- **Democratized Voice Creation Tools:** Enabling the development of voice creation tools with embedded accountability, empowering users to generate and share synthetic speech responsibly.

By addressing the critical challenge of verifying synthetic audio provenance, this research will contribute to the ethical deployment of TTS models and mitigate the risks associated with AI-generated speech.
