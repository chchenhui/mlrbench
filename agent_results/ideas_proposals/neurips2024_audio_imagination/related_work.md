**Key Challenges**:

1. **Imperceptibility vs. Robustness Trade-off**: Balancing the imperceptibility of watermarks with their robustness against various audio transformations remains a significant challenge.

2. **Integration with Generative Models**: Embedding watermarks directly into the synthesis process without degrading audio quality or synthesis performance is complex.

3. **Detection Accuracy**: Achieving high detection accuracy, especially in zero-shot scenarios where the detector has not been exposed to specific generative models, is difficult.

4. **Ethical and Privacy Concerns**: Ensuring that watermarking methods do not infringe on user privacy or ethical standards while providing traceability is a delicate balance.

5. **Standardization and Benchmarking**: The lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics for audio watermarking in generative models hinders the comparison and improvement of different approaches.
