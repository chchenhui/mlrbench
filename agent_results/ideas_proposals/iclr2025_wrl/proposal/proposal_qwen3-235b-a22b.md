# Bridging the Reality Gap: Self-Adaptive Sim-to-Real Transfer Learning for Robust Robot Skills

## 1. Introduction

### Background  
Sim-to-real transfer learning has emerged as a critical paradigm for training robots in complex, unstructured environments. While simulation offers scalable, safe, and cost-effective training, the "reality gap"—the discrepancy between simulated and physical dynamics—remains a major barrier to deploying simulation-trained policies in the real world. Traditional approaches like domain randomization (Tobin et al., 2017) and domain adaptation (Bousmalis et al., 2018) often require manual tuning or sacrifice performance to ensure robustness. Recent advances in meta-learning (e.g., MAML; Finn et al., 2017) and uncertainty-aware control (Gal et al., 2016) have shown promise in enabling rapid adaptation, but existing methods typically decouple pre-training from online learning or lack formal guarantees for stability and data efficiency.

### Research Objectives  
This work proposes a unified self-adaptive sim-to-real framework that continuously bridges the reality gap during real-world deployment. The core objectives are:  
1. **Online System Identification**: Learn and update physical dynamics models in real-time using sparse interaction data.  
2. **Meta-Learned Adaptation Policies**: Train policies in simulation to optimize rapid adaptation to novel environments, rather than fixed performance in a single domain.  
3. **Uncertainty-Aware Control**: Dynamically balance exploration and exploitation based on model confidence, ensuring robustness to unmodeled dynamics and hardware degradation.  

### Significance  
By enabling robots to autonomously refine their simulation-trained skills through real-world experience, this framework addresses key limitations of current sim-to-real methods:  
- **Reduced Manual Effort**: Eliminates the need for handcrafted domain randomization or post-hoc tuning.  
- **Generalization**: Enhances robustness to environmental changes (e.g., varying friction, object properties) and hardware wear.  
- **Data Efficiency**: Minimizes real-world interaction time, critical for safety-critical or resource-constrained applications.  
This work aligns with the workshop’s focus on advancing embodied AI to achieve human-level physical capabilities in non-humanoid robots, enabling deployment in dynamic settings like household assistance and disaster response.

## 2. Methodology

### Framework Overview  
The proposed framework integrates three components (Figure 1):  
1. **Neural System Identification Module**: A probabilistic dynamics model updated online via real-world data.  
2. **Meta-Learning Architecture**: A policy trained in simulation to minimize adaptation time in unseen environments.  
3. **Uncertainty-Aware Controller**: A model predictive control (MPC) module that adjusts exploration based on model confidence.

### 2.1 Neural System Identification  
**Objective**: Learn a latent dynamics model $ f_\theta $ that maps state-action pairs to next-state distributions:  
$$
p(s_{t+1} \mid s_t, a_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta(s_t, a_t), \Sigma_\theta(s_t, a_t)),
$$  
where $ \theta $ are neural network parameters.  

**Online Adaptation**:  
- **Data Collection**: During real-world deployment, the robot collects trajectories $ \tau = \{(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})\} $.  
- **Probabilistic Ensemble**: Maintain an ensemble of $ K $ models $ \{f_{\theta_k}\}_{k=1}^K $ to quantify epistemic uncertainty via Jensen-Rényi divergence (Kim et al., 2023):  
  $$
  \mathcal{U}(s, a) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K D_{\text{KL}}\left(p_k(s_{t+1} \mid s, a) \parallel \frac{1}{K} \sum_{j=1}^K p_j(s_{t+1} \mid s, a)\right).
  $$  
- **Update Rule**: Use maximum likelihood estimation with a sliding window of recent data:  
  $$
  \theta_k^* = \arg\min_\theta \sum_{(s,a,s') \in \mathcal{D}_{\text{real}}} \left[ -\log p_{\theta_k}(s' \mid s, a) \right] + \lambda \|\theta_k - \theta_k^{\text{prior}}\|^2,
  $$  
  where $ \lambda $ regularizes updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

### 2.2 Meta-Learning for Rapid Adaptation  
**Objective**: Train a policy $ \pi_\phi $ in simulation to minimize adaptation cost in real-world environments.  

**Algorithm**:  
1. **Task Distribution**: Sample training domains in simulation with randomized dynamics (mass, friction, etc.).  
2. **MAML-Based Optimization**: For each task $ \mathcal{T}_i $, compute:  
   - **Inner Loop (Adaptation)**: Update policy parameters via gradient descent on task-specific data:  
     $$
     \phi_i' = \phi - \alpha \nabla_\phi \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(\phi),
     $$  
     where $ \alpha $ is the adaptation step size.  
   - **Outer Loop (Meta-Update)**: Optimize $ \phi $ to minimize loss after adaptation:  
     $$
     \phi \leftarrow \phi - \beta \nabla_\phi \sum_{\mathcal{T}_i} \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(\phi_i'),
     $$  
     with $ \beta $ as the meta-learning rate.  

**Key Innovation**: Unlike AdaptSim (Ren et al., 2023), which iteratively adapts via real-world rollouts, our meta-policy is optimized for single-step adaptation, enabling faster convergence during deployment.

### 2.3 Uncertainty-Aware Control  
**Objective**: Modulate exploration-exploitation trade-offs using model uncertainty $ \mathcal{U}(s, a) $.  

**Implementation**:  
- **MPC with Uncertainty Penalty**: At each timestep, solve:  
  $$
  a_t^* = \arg\max_a \sum_{t=0}^H \gamma^t \left[ r(s_t, a_t) - \beta \mathcal{U}(s_t, a_t) \right],
  $$  
  where $ H $ is the planning horizon, $ \gamma $ the discount factor, and $ \beta $ balances reward maximization against uncertainty reduction.  
- **Safe Exploration**: If $ \mathcal{U}(s, a) > \tau $ (threshold), trigger active exploration via entropy regularization:  
  $$
  a_t^* = \arg\max_a \left[ Q(s, a) + \lambda \mathcal{H}(\pi(\cdot \mid s)) \right].
  $$  

This extends prior work (Davis & Brown, 2024) by dynamically adjusting $ \beta $ based on task progress.
