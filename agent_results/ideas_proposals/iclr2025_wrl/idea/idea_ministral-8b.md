### Title: Enhancing Robotic Perception with Multi-Modal Learning for Human-Level Abilities

### Motivation:
Current robotic systems struggle with tasks that humans perform effortlessly, such as cooking or tidying up a house, due to limitations in perception, decision-making, and adaptability. Improving these aspects is crucial for developing robots with human-level abilities. By integrating multi-modal learning techniques, we aim to enhance robots' ability to perceive and interpret their environment more accurately, enabling them to perform a wide range of activities with robustness and efficiency.

### Main Idea:
This research focuses on developing a novel multi-modal learning framework that combines visual, auditory, and tactile data to improve robotic perception. The proposed methodology involves training a large multi-modal model using a diverse dataset of real-world scenarios. The model will be designed to integrate sim-to-real bridging techniques to ensure smooth transitions between simulated and real environments. Additionally, we will explore safe policy optimization methods to ensure that the robot's actions are safe and efficient.

The expected outcomes include a significant improvement in the robot's ability to perceive and understand its environment, leading to enhanced decision-making and task performance. The proposed framework will be evaluated using standardized task suites and robust metrics, ensuring its effectiveness and generalizability across various real-world domains, such as household assistance and industrial automation. This research has the potential to significantly advance the field of robotics, bringing us closer to achieving human-level robotic abilities.
