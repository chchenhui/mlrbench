**2. Key Challenges**

1. **Reality Gap**: The discrepancy between simulated and real-world environments remains a significant challenge, affecting the transferability of learned policies.

2. **Online Adaptation**: Developing methods that enable robots to adapt their models and policies in real-time during deployment without human intervention is complex and computationally demanding.

3. **Uncertainty Estimation**: Accurately estimating and managing uncertainty in dynamic environments is crucial for robust robot control but remains an open problem.

4. **Data Efficiency**: Ensuring that adaptation and learning processes are data-efficient, especially when real-world data collection is limited or expensive, is a persistent challenge.

5. **Stability Guarantees**: Maintaining stability during online adaptation and learning is essential to prevent unsafe behaviors, yet providing formal stability guarantees is difficult.
