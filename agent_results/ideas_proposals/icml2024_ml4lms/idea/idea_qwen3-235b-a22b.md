1. **Title**: "Hierarchical Multi-Scale Graph Neural Networks for Integrated Biomolecular and Materials Modeling"  
2. **Motivation**: Biological and materials systems operate across multiple scales (atomic, molecular, cellular), yet current ML models often treat these scales in isolation. This fragmentation limits the ability to predict complex phenomena like drug efficacy or material stability, which depend on cross-scale interactions. Developing models that seamlessly integrate multi-scale data is critical for accelerating discoveries in healthcare, energy, and sustainable materials.  
3. **Main Idea**: Propose a hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) architecture that explicitly models interactions across scales. Each hierarchy level processes a distinct scale (e.g., atoms → molecules → tissues), using scale-specific graph representations (e.g., molecular graphs, crystal lattices, cellular networks). Inter-level communication modules propagate relevant features (e.g., atomic vibrations influencing protein folding), while a global readout aggregates predictions. The model will be trained on multi-omics and materials datasets with known cross-scale dependencies, using physics-informed loss functions to enforce domain-specific constraints. Expected outcomes include improved accuracy in predicting properties like enzyme activity or battery conductivity, alongside interpretable insights into cross-scale mechanisms. This could enable rapid in silico screening of drug candidates or materials, reducing experimental costs and time-to-market.
