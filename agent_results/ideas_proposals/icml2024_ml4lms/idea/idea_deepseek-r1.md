**Title:** Multiscale Molecular Benchmark Suite (MMBS): Standardizing Evaluation Across Biological and Chemical Scales  

**Motivation:** Current ML models in life and materials science often struggle to generalize across the multiscale representations critical to these domains (e.g., atomic vs. molecular vs. tissue-level data). Disjointed benchmarks and dataset biases hinder industrial adoption by obscuring model limitations in real-world applications.  

**Main Idea:** Develop MMBS, a comprehensive benchmark suite with standardized tasks and datasets spanning electronic structure, molecular graphs, protein sequences, and tissue-level omics. Tasks include cross-scale property prediction (e.g., predicting material stability from atomic graphs or drug efficacy from protein interactions). The suite would integrate physics-based simulations, experimental data, and synthetic noise to assess model robustness, generalizability, and computational efficiency. Expected outcomes: (1) Identification of failure modes in existing models (e.g., graph networks failing at long-range molecular interactions), (2) Guidelines for cross-scale model design, and (3) A leaderboard to track progress. Impact: Accelerate industrial deployment by enabling models that seamlessly integrate multiscale data, reducing trial-and-error in drug/material discovery.
