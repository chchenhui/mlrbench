# Automated Dual-Network Framework for Molecular Dataset Curation and Quality Control in Life Science Machine Learning

## 1. Introduction

Machine learning has emerged as a transformative technology in life sciences and materials discovery, enabling researchers to predict molecular properties, design novel compounds, and accelerate drug discovery. However, the success of these applications critically depends on the quality and reliability of the underlying data. Unlike domains such as computer vision or natural language processing where human intuition can often detect anomalies, molecular data quality issues remain challenging to identify automatically due to their complex nature and high dimensionality.

Molecular datasets frequently contain experimental errors, inconsistencies in measurement protocols, biases from specific experimental conditions, and improper handling of outliers. These issues often go undetected during model development, leading to what appears to be promising performance on benchmarks but poor generalization to real-world applications. Current approaches to dataset curation in this domain are predominantly manual, time-consuming, and subjective, resulting in a bottleneck that significantly hampers progress in applying machine learning to life science challenges.

Recent advances in self-supervised learning, as demonstrated in works like GROVER (Rong et al., 2020) and MoCL (Sun et al., 2021), have shown tremendous potential for learning molecular representations from limited labeled data. However, these approaches assume the underlying data is reliable. Similarly, evaluation frameworks like MOLGRAPHEVAL (Wang et al., 2022) highlight inconsistencies in assessment methodologies but do not directly address the foundational issue of data quality.

This research proposal aims to develop a novel dual-network framework that simultaneously curates molecular datasets while learning to identify common quality issues. Our approach combines recent advances in self-supervised learning with adversarial training paradigms to create a system that not only improves existing datasets but also serves as a transferable quality assessment tool for evaluating new data sources. By incorporating domain knowledge through physics-based constraints and chemical feasibility checks, the system will be adaptable to diverse molecular data types, including protein structures, small molecules, and crystal structures.

The specific objectives of this research are to:

1. Develop a self-supervised dual-network architecture that can identify and correct inconsistencies in molecular datasets
2. Create a transferable framework for assessing data quality in various types of molecular data
3. Establish a set of physics-based and chemical feasibility constraints that can guide the curation process
4. Validate the approach on diverse molecular datasets with artificially introduced errors and real-world noisy datasets
5. Demonstrate improved downstream performance on standard prediction tasks using curated datasets

This research addresses a critical gap in current machine learning applications in life sciences and materials discovery. By developing automated methods for dataset curation and quality control, we aim to significantly improve the reliability and applicability of machine learning models in these domains, ultimately accelerating the pace of scientific discovery and translational impact.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed methodology consists of four main components: (1) the dual-network architecture design, (2) the self-supervised learning framework, (3) physics-based and chemical constraints integration, and (4) experimental validation approach.

### 2.1 Dual-Network Architecture

We propose a dual-network architecture consisting of a Curator Network (CN) and an Adversarial Quality Assessment Network (AQAN):

**Curator Network (CN)**: This component identifies potentially problematic data points and suggests corrections. The CN is designed as a graph-based transformer architecture inspired by GROVER (Rong et al., 2020), consisting of:

1. A message-passing neural network (MPNN) encoder that captures local structural information of molecules:

$$h_v^{(0)} = \text{Embed}(a_v)$$

$$h_v^{(l+1)} = \text{Update}\left(h_v^{(l)}, \text{Aggregate}\left(\{h_u^{(l)}, e_{uv} : u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\}\right)\right)$$

Where $h_v^{(l)}$ represents the node feature vector for atom $v$ at layer $l$, $a_v$ is the atom type, $\mathcal{N}(v)$ denotes the neighbors of atom $v$, and $e_{uv}$ represents the bond features between atoms $u$ and $v$.

2. A transformer-based module that incorporates contextual information across the entire molecule:

$$\mathbf{Z} = \text{MultiheadAttention}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V})$$

Where $\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}$ are query, key, and value matrices derived from node embeddings.

3. An anomaly detection head that identifies potential errors in the input data:

$$p_{\text{anomaly}}(v) = \sigma(W_{\text{anomaly}}h_v + b_{\text{anomaly}})$$

4. A correction suggestion head that proposes modifications to identified anomalies:

$$\hat{h}_v = \text{MLP}_{\text{correction}}(h_v)$$

**Adversarial Quality Assessment Network (AQAN)**: This component challenges the corrections proposed by the CN, trying to distinguish between corrected data and genuine high-quality data. The AQAN consists of:

1. A similar graph-based encoder as the CN but with separate parameters
2. A discrimination head that estimates the probability of a molecule being corrected:

$$p_{\text{corrected}}(G) = \sigma\left(W_{\text{disc}}\text{Pool}(\{h_v : v \in G\}) + b_{\text{disc}}\right)$$

Where $\text{Pool}$ is a graph pooling operation.

### 2.2 Self-Supervised Learning Framework

Our training approach involves three phases:

**Phase 1: Pretraining the CN with Synthetic Errors**
We create a controlled dataset by introducing synthetic errors into high-quality molecular data. These errors simulate common issues:
- Random bond deletion/addition
- Atom type substitution
- Inconsistent chirality
- Unrealistic bond lengths or angles
- Missing functional groups

The CN is trained to identify and correct these synthetic errors through a multi-task loss function:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{CN}} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{detection}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{correction}} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{reconstruction}}$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{detection}}$ is the binary cross-entropy loss for anomaly detection
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{correction}}$ is the prediction error for corrected features
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{reconstruction}}$ is the overall molecular reconstruction loss
- $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ are hyperparameters balancing the different objectives

**Phase 2: Adversarial Training**
Once the CN reaches initial convergence, we introduce the AQAN and train both networks in an adversarial manner:

1. The CN attempts to make corrections that are indistinguishable from genuine high-quality data
2. The AQAN tries to discriminate between original and corrected data

This leads to the following adversarial loss functions:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{AQAN}} = -\mathbb{E}_{G \sim p_{\text{data}}}[\log(1-p_{\text{corrected}}(G))] - \mathbb{E}_{G \sim p_{\text{corrected}}}[\log(p_{\text{corrected}}(G))]$$

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{CN-adv}} = -\mathbb{E}_{G \sim p_{\text{corrected}}}[\log(1-p_{\text{corrected}}(G))]$$

The total CN loss becomes:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{CN-total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{CN}} + \lambda_4 \mathcal{L}_{\text{CN-adv}}$$

**Phase 3: Contrastive Learning Enhancement**
Inspired by MoCL (Sun et al., 2021), we incorporate contrastive learning to further improve the learned representations:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} = -\log\frac{\exp(s(z_i, z_j)/\tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^{2N}\mathbbm{1}_{[k \neq i]}\exp(s(z_i, z_k)/\tau)}$$

Where $s$ is a similarity function, $z_i$ and $z_j$ are embeddings of positive pairs, and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.

### 2.3 Integration of Physics-Based and Chemical Constraints

To ensure the proposed corrections are chemically valid, we incorporate domain knowledge through:

1. **Valence constraints**: Ensuring corrected molecules satisfy atomic valence rules
2. **Bond length and angle constraints**: Penalizing unrealistic geometries using:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{geometry}} = \sum_{(u,v) \in \text{bonds}} w_{uv}(d_{uv} - d_{uv}^{\text{ref}})^2 + \sum_{(u,v,w) \in \text{angles}} w_{uvw}(\theta_{uvw} - \theta_{uvw}^{\text{ref}})^2$$

3. **Functional group preservation**: Identifying and maintaining key functional groups
4. **Chemical stability assessment**: Evaluating the energetic stability of corrected structures using simplified energy functions or pre-trained property predictors

These constraints are incorporated into the training process as additional loss terms or through constrained optimization.

### 2.4 Experimental Validation

We will validate our approach through a comprehensive series of experiments:

**Dataset Preparation**:
1. High-quality reference datasets: QM9, ZINC, PDBbind
2. Artificially corrupted versions with varying levels of introduced errors (10%, 20%, 30%)
3. Real-world noisy datasets with known quality issues

**Evaluation Metrics**:
1. **Error Detection Performance**:
   - Precision, recall, and F1-score for identifying introduced errors
   - Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)

2. **Correction Quality**:
   - Reconstruction accuracy (compared to original molecules)
   - Chemical validity rate (using RDKit)
   - Distribution matching between corrected and reference datasets (using molecular descriptors)

3. **Downstream Task Performance**:
   - Property prediction tasks (ESOL solubility, lipophilicity, blood-brain barrier penetration)
   - Virtual screening effectiveness (enrichment factors, AUC)
   - Crystal structure prediction accuracy

**Experimental Design**:
1. **Ablation Studies**:
   - Effect of each component (CN alone, with/without physics constraints, with/without adversarial training)
   - Importance of different synthetic error types

2. **Generalization Tests**:
   - Cross-dataset generalization (train on QM9, test on ZINC)
   - Cross-task generalization (curate for one property, test on others)

3. **Comparison with Baselines**:
   - Standard outlier detection methods (Isolation Forest, DBSCAN)
   - Graph autoencoder-based anomaly detection
   - Manual curation by domain experts (on a smaller subset)

4. **Real-World Application**:
   - Curate publicly available datasets with known quality issues
   - Collaborate with domain experts to evaluate the chemical meaningfulness of identified issues and proposed corrections

5. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - Training time scalability with dataset size
   - Inference time for real-time quality assessment
