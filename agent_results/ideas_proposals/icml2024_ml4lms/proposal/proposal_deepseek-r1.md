### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Machine learning (ML) has transformative potential in life and material sciences, offering accelerated discovery of therapeutics, materials, and agrochemicals. However, the reliability of ML models hinges on the quality of molecular datasets, which are often plagued by experimental errors, inconsistencies, and biases. Current curation practices rely heavily on manual inspection, which is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error. These limitations lead to unreliable benchmarks and hinder the deployment of ML in real-world applications, such as drug discovery and materials design.  

Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) for molecular data—such as graph-based contrastive learning (MoCL) and transformer architectures (GROVER)—highlight progress in representation learning. However, existing frameworks lack systematic tools to address dataset quality issues. For instance, MOLGRAPHEVAL reveals inconsistencies in embedding evaluations, while persistent homology methods (arXiv:2311.17327) emphasize the need for robust feature extraction. These gaps underscore the urgency of developing automated, domain-aware curation systems.  

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal aims to:  
1. Develop a **dual-network AI system** that jointly curates molecular datasets and identifies data quality issues via self-supervised learning.  
2. Integrate domain-specific constraints (e.g., chemical validity, thermodynamic feasibility) to ensure corrections align with physical principles.  
3. Validate the system across diverse molecular data types (small molecules, proteins, crystal structures) and benchmark against state-of-the-art curation tools.  
4. Create a transferable quality assessment framework for real-time evaluation of new datasets.  

**Significance**  
By automating dataset curation and quality control, this work will:  
- Reduce reliance on error-prone manual processes.  
- Improve the reliability of ML benchmarks in life and material sciences.  
- Accelerate translational research by enabling robust deployment of ML models in industry settings.  
- Address critical challenges identified in prior literature, such as generalization to novel molecules and integration of domain knowledge.

### 3. **Methodology**  
**Research Design**  
The proposed system combines a **curator network** (responsible for data correction) and an **adversarial network** (designed to challenge corrections) in a self-supervised framework. The workflow includes data preprocessing, controlled corruption, dual-network training, and validation (Figure 1).  

**Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
- **Sources**: High-quality datasets (e.g., ChEMBL for small molecules, Protein Data Bank for structures, Materials Project for crystals) will serve as ground-truth references.  
- **Controlled Corruption**: Clean data will be artificially corrupted to simulate common experimental errors:  
  - **Noise injection**: Random perturbations to molecular coordinates or properties.  
  - **Label swapping**: Incorrect assignment of biological activity or material properties.  
  - **Structural anomalies**: Invalid bond orders or steric clashes.  

**Dual-Network Architecture**  
1. **Curator Network ($C$)**  
   - **Architecture**: Graph Neural Network (GNN) or Graph Transformer (e.g., GROVER) to process molecular graphs.  
   - **Input**: Corrupted molecular data $x'$.  
   - **Output**: Corrected data $\hat{x} = C(x')$.  
   - **Loss Function**: Combines reconstruction loss ($\mathcal{L}_{corr}$) and domain-specific constraints ($\mathcal{L}_{domain}$):  
     $$
     \mathcal{L}_C = \mathbb{E}_{x' \sim \mathcal{D}'} \left[ \|C(x') - x\|^2 + \alpha \cdot \mathcal{L}_{domain}(C(x')) \right]
     $$
     where $x$ is the clean data, $\alpha$ balances losses, and $\mathcal{L}_{domain}$ enforces validity (e.g., bond length/angle feasibility via molecular mechanics force fields).  

2. **Adversarial Network ($A$)**  
   - **Architecture**: Discriminator model (e.g., CNN or GNN) trained to distinguish corrected data $\hat{x}$ from clean data $x$.  
   - **Loss Function**: Adversarial loss ($\mathcal{L}_{adv}$) to maximize detection of curator errors:  
     $$
     \mathcal{L}_A = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \log A(x) \right] + \mathbb{E}_{x' \sim \mathcal{D}'} \left[ \log (1 - A(C(x'))) \right]
     $$

**Training Protocol**  
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: The networks are trained jointly in a minimax game:  
  $$
  \min_C \max_A \mathcal{L}_C + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_A
  $$
  where $\lambda$ controls the adversarial component.  
- **Curriculum Learning**: Gradually increase corruption complexity (e.g., from random noise to systematic biases) to enhance robustness.  

**Domain Knowledge Integration**  
- **Physics-Based Checks**: Embed rules from molecular dynamics (e.g., valid bond lengths via Morse potentials) into $\mathcal{L}_{domain}$.  
- **Chemical Feasibility**: Use SMILES validation and retrosynthesis tools to ensure corrected molecules are synthetically plausible.  

**Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against manual curation, rule-based tools (e.g., RDKit sanitization), and SSL models (MoCL, GROVER).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  1. **Correction Accuracy**:  
     - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between corrected ($\hat{x}$) and clean ($x$) data.  
     - Precision/Recall for error detection (e.g., ROC-AUC).  
  2. **Downstream Task Performance**:  
     - Property prediction (e.g., solubility, toxicity) using ML models trained on curated vs. uncorrected data.  
     - Generalization to novel molecules (e.g., time-split validation).  
  3. **Computational Efficiency**: Training time and inference latency.  

**Validation Datasets**  
- **Small Molecules**: ChEMBL, ZINC.  
- **Proteins**: PDB, AlphaFold DB.  
- **Materials**: Materials Project, OQMD.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. A **dual-network AI framework** capable of automated molecular dataset curation with self-supervised error detection.  
2. Demonstrated improvement in dataset quality (e.g., 30% reduction in RMSE vs. rule-based methods) and downstream ML performance (e.g., 15% higher ROC-AUC in property prediction).  
3. A domain-agnostic toolkit adaptable to proteins, small molecules, and materials, validated across 10+ benchmarks.  

**Impact**  
- **Scientific Communityes thees the "garbage in, garbage out" problem in ML for life sciences, enabling reproducible and reliable research.  
- **Industry Applications**: Reduces costs and time-to-market for drug and material discovery by minimizing manual curation.  
- **Societal Benefits**: Accelerates solutions to global challenges (e.g., climate change, pandemics) through faster, data-driven innovation.  

**Future Directions**  
- Extend the framework to multi-modal data (e.g., omics, microscopy images).  
- Develop real-time curation APIs for laboratory instrumentation.
