# Hierarchical Predictive Coding Networks for Free Energy Minimization in Reinforcement Learning

## 1. Introduction

### Background
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in various domains, from game playing to robotic control. However, traditional RL algorithms suffer from high sample complexity, requiring extensive environment interactions to learn effective policies. This inefficiency starkly contrasts with biological learning systems, which demonstrate remarkable sample efficiency when acquiring new skills and adapting to novel environments. The brain's ability to learn from limited data suggests fundamental principles that could revolutionize artificial intelligence if properly understood and implemented.

Neuroscience theories, particularly predictive coding and active inference, offer compelling explanations for the brain's efficiency. Predictive coding posits that the brain continually generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates its internal models based on prediction errors. Active inference extends this framework by suggesting that actions are selected to minimize expected free energy—the difference between predicted and actual sensory states—creating a unified account of perception and action. These neuro-inspired principles could address key limitations in current RL approaches.

Recent advances in NeuroAI have begun exploring the integration of these principles into artificial systems. Works such as Active Predictive Coding Networks (Rao et al., 2022; Gklezakos & Rao, 2022) and Meta-Representational Predictive Coding (Ororbia et al., 2025) demonstrate the potential of combining predictive coding with reinforcement learning. However, these approaches have not fully captured the hierarchical nature of brain processing or effectively balanced exploration and exploitation in complex environments with sparse rewards.

### Research Objectives
This research aims to develop a novel data-efficient reinforcement learning framework that embodies active inference principles through hierarchical predictive coding networks. Specifically, we seek to:

1. Design a multi-level hierarchical predictive coding architecture that learns to predict sensory observations at different temporal and spatial scales.
2. Formulate an action selection mechanism based on active inference that minimizes expected free energy, balancing information gain and reward maximization.
3. Implement adaptive learning rates based on uncertainty estimates to accelerate learning in unfamiliar situations while preserving knowledge in familiar contexts.
4. Evaluate the approach on sparse-reward and complex exploration tasks, demonstrating improved sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL algorithms.

### Significance
The proposed research bridges neuroscience theories and artificial intelligence, potentially advancing both fields. For AI, it offers a path toward more sample-efficient learning algorithms that could reduce computational costs and expand the applicability of RL to real-world scenarios where environment interactions are costly or limited. For neuroscience, it provides computational implementations of theories about brain function that can generate testable predictions.

The framework also addresses several key challenges in current RL research: sample efficiency through principled uncertainty-driven exploration, compositional representation learning via hierarchical prediction, and adaptive computation that allocates resources based on task complexity. By formalizing the free energy principle in a computational framework, this research contributes to the development of more cognitively plausible artificial intelligence systems that learn and reason in ways similar to biological organisms.

## 2. Methodology

### Hierarchical Predictive Coding Architecture

We propose a hierarchical predictive coding network (HPCN) consisting of multiple levels, each responsible for predicting representations at different temporal and spatial scales. Each level $l$ in the hierarchy maintains:

1. A state representation $s_l$ that captures abstractions at that level
2. A generative model $g_l$ that predicts lower-level states
3. A recognition model $r_l$ that infers the current state based on bottom-up inputs
4. A transition model $t_l$ that predicts future states based on current states and actions

Formally, for a hierarchy with $L$ levels, the dynamics are defined as:

$$s_l^t = r_l(s_{l-1}^t, s_l^{t-1})$$

$$\hat{s}_{l-1}^t = g_l(s_l^t)$$

$$\varepsilon_l^t = s_{l-1}^t - \hat{s}_{l-1}^t$$

$$s_l^{t+1} = t_l(s_l^t, a^t)$$

where $s_l^t$ is the state at level $l$ and time $t$, $\hat{s}_{l-1}^t$ is the prediction of the lower level state, $\varepsilon_l^t$ is the prediction error, and $a^t$ is the action taken at time $t$.

The lowest level ($l=0$) corresponds to raw sensory observations, while higher levels represent increasingly abstract features of the environment. Each level attempts to predict the level below it, with prediction errors driving learning throughout the hierarchy.

### Free Energy Minimization

The system is trained to minimize variational free energy across all levels of the hierarchy. For each level $l$, the free energy $F_l$ is defined as:

$$F_l = \mathbb{E}_{q(s_l)}[- \log p(s_{l-1}|s_l)] + D_{KL}[q(s_l)||p(s_l|s_{l+1})]$$

where $q(s_l)$ is the recognition distribution over states at level $l$, $p(s_{l-1}|s_l)$ is the likelihood of lower-level states given the current level, and $p(s_l|s_{l+1})$ is the prior distribution over current states given the higher level.

In practice, we parameterize these distributions as Gaussian with learned means and variances:

$$q(s_l) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_{q,l}, \sigma^2_{q,l})$$

$$p(s_{l-1}|s_l) = \mathcal{N}(g_l(s_l), \sigma^2_{p,l-1})$$

$$p(s_l|s_{l+1}) = \mathcal{N}(g_{l+1}(s_{l+1}), \sigma^2_{p,l})$$

The recognition models $r_l$ and generative models $g_l$ are implemented as deep neural networks. Specifically, we use recurrent neural networks (GRUs or LSTMs) for temporal dependencies and convolutional neural networks for spatial structure in visual inputs.

### Active Inference for Action Selection

The action selection mechanism follows active inference principles, choosing actions that minimize expected free energy (EFE) in future states. The EFE for an action $a$ at time $t$ is defined as:

$$G(a, t) = \mathbb{E}_{q(s^{t+1}|a)}[- \log p(s^{t+1}|a) - \log p(r|s^{t+1})]$$

where $q(s^{t+1}|a)$ is the predicted distribution over future states given action $a$, $p(s^{t+1}|a)$ is the prior probability of those states, and $p(r|s^{t+1})$ is the probability of receiving reward $r$ in state $s^{t+1}$.

The first term represents information gain (exploration), while the second term captures expected reward (exploitation). This formulation naturally balances between seeking informative states that reduce uncertainty about the world model and pursuing rewarding states.

To implement this in practice, we use a Monte Carlo approach:
1. For each possible action $a$, generate $N$ predictions of the next state using the transition model
2. Calculate the expected free energy for each action by averaging over these predictions
3. Select the action with the lowest expected free energy

$$a^* = \underset{a}{\arg\min} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [- \log p(s_i^{t+1}|a) - \log p(r|s_i^{t+1})]$$

### Meta-Learning for Adaptive Precision

A key aspect of predictive coding is the concept of precision, which weights prediction errors according to their reliability. We implement adaptive precision through meta-learning, where the system learns to adjust its learning rates based on the context.

For each level $l$, we introduce a precision parameter $\pi_l$ that modulates the influence of prediction errors:

$$\Delta \theta_l \propto \pi_l \cdot \nabla_{\theta_l} F_l$$

where $\theta_l$ represents the parameters of the models at level $l$, and $\nabla_{\theta_l} F_l$ is the gradient of free energy with respect to these parameters.

The precision parameters are themselves updated based on the consistency of prediction errors over time:

$$\pi_l \leftarrow \pi_l - \alpha \nabla_{\pi_l} \mathbb{E}[F_l]$$

where $\alpha$ is a meta-learning rate. This allows the system to assign higher precision (and thus learning rates) to reliable sources of information while downweighting unreliable ones.

### Training Algorithm

The complete training algorithm integrates free energy minimization with reinforcement learning:

1. Initialize all model parameters randomly
2. For each episode:
   a. Reset environment and receive initial observation $o^0$
   b. For each timestep $t$ in the episode:
      i. Update hierarchical state representations through bottom-up inference
      ii. Generate predictions for all levels through top-down generation
      iii. Compute free energy and prediction errors at each level
      iv. Select action by minimizing expected free energy
      v. Execute action and observe reward $r^t$ and next observation $o^{t+1}$
      vi. Update model parameters to minimize free energy
      vii. Update precision parameters through meta-learning
   c. Evaluate performance using cumulative rewards and prediction accuracy

### Experimental Design

We will evaluate our approach on the following environments:

1. **Sparse-reward environments**: Modified versions of standard control tasks (CartPole, MountainCar, etc.) where rewards are provided only upon reaching the goal state.

2. **Partially observable environments**: Tasks requiring memory and inference about hidden states, such as POMDPs with visual observations.

3. **Exploration-heavy environments**: Environments with large state spaces and deceptive rewards, such as Montezuma's Revenge and other hard-exploration Atari games.

4. **Compositional tasks**: Environments requiring understanding of part-whole relationships and compositional generalization.

For each environment, we will compare our method against:
- Model-free RL baselines (PPO, SAC, DQN)
- Model-based RL baselines (MuZero, Dreamer)
- Other neuro-inspired approaches (Active Predictive Coding Networks, Meta-Representational Predictive Coding)

We will evaluate using:
1. **Sample efficiency**: Learning curves plotting performance against environment interactions
2. **Final performance**: Asymptotic reward achieved after convergence
3. **Generalization**: Performance on modified versions of the training environments
4. **Representation quality**: Analysis of learned state representations through dimensionality reduction and visualization
5. **Computational efficiency**: Training time and resource usage compared to baseline methods

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Improved sample efficiency**: We expect our approach to demonstrate significantly reduced sample complexity compared to standard RL algorithms, particularly in sparse-reward and exploration-heavy environments. Quantitatively, we anticipate at least a 50% reduction in the number of environment interactions required to reach comparable performance levels.

2. **Enhanced exploration capabilities**: The active inference framework should provide more principled exploration, focusing on information-rich states rather than random exploration or simple novelty-seeking. This will be evident in the agent's ability to solve hard-exploration environments that stymie standard approaches.

3. **Hierarchical representation learning**: The hierarchical structure of our model should enable the learning of meaningful abstractions at different levels. We expect to observe emergent representations that capture task-relevant features at appropriate scales, from low-level perceptual details to high-level task structure.

4. **Uncertainty-aware behavior**: By incorporating adaptive precision and meta-learning, the agent should demonstrate context-sensitive behavior, adapting quickly to novel situations while maintaining stable performance in familiar contexts. This will be quantified through faster adaptation rates in transfer learning tasks.

5. **New theoretical insights**: Through ablation studies and careful analysis of model components, we expect to gain deeper understanding of how predictive coding and active inference principles contribute to learning efficiency. This may lead to novel theoretical connections between neuroscience theories and reinforcement learning algorithms.

### Scientific Impact

This research will advance the field of NeuroAI by providing concrete implementations of neuroscience-inspired principles in a reinforcement learning framework. Specifically:

1. **Bridging disciplines**: By translating concepts from predictive coding and active inference into computational algorithms with measurable performance, we create bridges between theoretical neuroscience and practical AI development.

2. **Validating theories**: The success or failure of our approach in different environments will provide empirical feedback on the validity and generality of predictive coding theories as explanations for efficient learning.

3. **Inspiring new algorithms**: The principles demonstrated in our framework could inspire new approaches to sample-efficient reinforcement learning beyond our specific implementation, potentially spawning a new class of neuro-inspired RL algorithms.

4. **Generating testable predictions**: Our computational implementation may generate novel predictions about brain function that could be tested in neuroscience experiments, creating a virtuous cycle between AI development and neuroscience research.

### Practical Impact

The practical implications of our research extend to various application domains:

1. **Robotics**: Sample efficiency is particularly crucial in robotics, where real-world interactions are expensive and time-consuming. Our approach could enable faster learning of complex manipulation tasks with physical robots.

2. **Healthcare**: Reinforcement learning applications in healthcare, such as treatment optimization, often face limited data availability due to ethical constraints. More sample-efficient algorithms could make RL more applicable in these critical domains.

3. **Resource-constrained AI**: By reducing the amount of data and computation required for effective learning, our approach contributes to more accessible and environmentally sustainable AI development.

4. **Continual learning systems**: The principles of adaptive precision and hierarchical prediction align well with the requirements of continual learning systems that must adapt to changing environments without catastrophic forgetting.

### Limitations and Future Work

While promising, we anticipate several challenges and limitations:

1. **Computational complexity**: The hierarchical architecture and predictive mechanisms may introduce additional computational overhead compared to simpler models. Future work may need to focus on more efficient implementations.

2. **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: The performance of the system may depend on careful tuning of hyperparameters such as the number of hierarchy levels and meta-learning rates. Automated methods for hyperparameter optimization will be important for practical applications.

3. **Scaling to complex problems**: While we expect our approach to handle the proposed experimental domains effectively, scaling to very high-dimensional observation spaces or extremely long temporal horizons may require additional innovations.

These limitations point to fruitful directions for future research, including the development of more scalable architectures, integration with complementary approaches like meta-reinforcement learning, and extensions to multi-agent settings where predictive models of other agents' behavior become crucial.
