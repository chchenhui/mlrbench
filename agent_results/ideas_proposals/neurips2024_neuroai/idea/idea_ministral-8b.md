### Title: **Neuro-inspired Continual Learning for Real-time Adaptation**

### Motivation:
The rapid advancement of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has led to significant breakthroughs in various domains, yet their reliance on large datasets and computational resources remains a limitation. Neuro-inspired continual learning aims to address these challenges by developing systems that can adapt and improve over time using small-data regimes, mimicking the brain's efficiency and robustness. This research is crucial for creating AI systems that can operate effectively in dynamic, real-world environments without the need for constant retraining.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research focuses on developing neuro-inspired continual learning algorithms that incorporate principles of Hebbian plasticity and spiking neural networks (SNNs). These algorithms will enable AI systems to learn from small datasets, adapt to new tasks, and maintain performance over time. The methodology involves designing SNN architectures that mimic the brain's neuronal structure and synaptic plasticity, allowing for efficient and real-time learning. The expected outcomes include the creation of AI models that can learn from minimal data, adapt to new tasks quickly, and maintain high performance over extended periods. The potential impact of this research is significant, as it could lead to the development of more efficient, robust, and adaptable AI systems that can operate in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices and real-time applications. Additionally, these models could contribute to a deeper understanding of biological neuronal function and inspire new approaches to AI development.
