**Title:** Active Predictive Coding: Integrating Predictive Processing and Active Inference for Sample-Efficient AI  

**Motivation:** Current AI systems require vast data and computational resources, limiting their applicability in dynamic, low-data settings. Bridging neuroscience principles like predictive coding (brainâ€™s error-driven learning) and active inference (action to minimize uncertainty) could enable AI to learn efficiently, akin to biological systems.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a neural framework combining predictive coding with active inference. The model will hierarchically predict sensory inputs, adjust via prediction errors (mimicking cortical processing), and actively sample data to resolve uncertainty. For example, in robotic navigation, the agent would predict environmental dynamics, refine predictions through movement-generated feedback, and prioritize exploration of uncertain regions. This would be tested against traditional reinforcement learning in sparse-reward, changing environments. Expected outcomes: (1) 50% reduction in training data needs compared to standard self-supervised models, (2) improved adaptability to unseen scenarios. Impact: Enables robust, human-like learning in real-world applications like personalized healthcare or autonomous systems, reducing reliance on resource-intensive training paradigms.
