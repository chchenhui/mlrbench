**1. Title:** **Contrastive Pretraining with Cross-Example Attention for Enhanced In-Context Learning**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, among which In-Context Learning (ICL) stands out as a paradigm-shifting phenomenon. ICL enables models to perform new tasks by conditioning on a few input-output examples provided within the prompt context, without requiring explicit gradient updates or fine-tuning. This allows for rapid adaptation to novel tasks, domains, and data distributions, making LLMs exceptionally versatile. The ICL 2024 workshop highlights the community's focus on understanding and advancing this capability, seeking new architectures, training paradigms, theoretical underpinnings, and robust evaluation methodologies.

Despite its promise, the effectiveness of ICL is highly sensitive to the quality, quantity, and representativeness of the provided context examples (Liu et al., 2022). A significant limitation of many current ICL approaches is that they implicitly treat context examples as independent demonstrations of an input-output mapping. While the underlying Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) allows for information flow between all tokens in the context, standard pretraining objectives (like next-token prediction) may not explicitly encourage the model to learn and leverage the *relational structure* or comparative information *between* different examples. This oversight represents a missed opportunity, as understanding how examples relate to each other – their similarities, differences, and underlying patterns – could potentially lead to more robust and efficient task inference. For instance, identifying that two examples illustrate contrasting aspects of a concept, or reinforcing a pattern through consistent examples, could provide stronger learning signals than treating each example in isolation. This challenge is echoed in the literature, highlighting difficulties in example selection and modeling inter-example relationships (Ye et al., 2023; Gonzalez et al., 2024).

Recent works have started exploring the integration of contrastive learning principles with ICL. Some approaches apply contrastive methods during *inference* to refine output distributions or select better examples (Peng et al., 2025; Mo et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2023). Others investigate contrastive pretraining objectives (Johnson et al., 2023; Martinez et al., 2025) or specific architectural modifications like cross-example attention (Gonzalez et al., 2024). However, a cohesive framework that integrates *contrastive pretraining specifically designed to learn inter-example relationships* with *architectural support for modeling these relationships* (i.e., cross-example attention) and *informed inference-time strategies* remains largely unexplored.

**2.2 Research Idea: Contrastive In-Context Learning (CICL)**
This research proposes **Contrastive In-Context Learning (CICL)**, a novel approach designed to enhance ICL by explicitly training models to understand and leverage the relationships between context examples. The core idea is to introduce a self-supervised contrastive objective during the pretraining phase, complementing the standard language modeling objective. This contrastive task specifically encourages the model to compare and contrast different examples, learning representations that capture their relational structure.

To achieve this, CICL incorporates three key components:
1.  **Cross-Example Attention Mechanism:** An architectural modification to the standard Transformer potentially allowing attention heads to explicitly compute relationships *across* distinct examples within the context, rather than solely within a single concatenated sequence.
2.  **Contrastive Pretraining Objective:** A self-supervised loss function optimized during pretraining that pushes representations of "similar" example pairs closer together and "dissimilar" example pairs further apart in the embedding space. Similarity can be defined based on underlying task structure, semantic content, or other heuristics extractable from large pretraining corpora.
3.  **Informed Inference-Time Example Selection:** An algorithm designed to leverage the relationally-aware representations learned during pretraining to select a context set that is maximally informative for the target query, potentially balancing relevance, diversity, and contrast.

By pretraining the model to reason comparatively about examples, we hypothesize that CICL will lead to more effective ICL, particularly in challenging scenarios involving few-shot learning or noisy/ambiguous context examples. This approach directly addresses identified challenges regarding example quality and the modeling of inter-example relationships, aiming to bridge the gap between representation learning (via contrastive objectives) and the emergent algorithmic capabilities of ICL.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:
1.  To design and implement the CICL framework, integrating a cross-example attention mechanism with a novel contrastive pretraining objective focused on inter-example relationships.
2.  To develop a self-supervised strategy for generating positive and negative example pairs from large-scale pretraining corpora suitable for the contrastive objective.
3.  To devise and evaluate an inference-time example selection algorithm that leverages the representations learned by CICL.
4.  To comprehensively evaluate the performance of CICL-pretrained models on a diverse set of downstream ICL classification, regression, and potentially generation tasks, comparing against strong baselines including standard LLMs and related contrastive ICL methods.
5.  To conduct ablation studies and analyses to understand the specific contributions of the cross-example attention mechanism, the contrastive pretraining objective, and the example selection strategy.
6.  To analyze the learned representations to gain insights into how CICL captures inter-example relationships.

**2.4 Significance**
This research holds significant potential contributions:
*   **Advancing ICL Understanding:** It probes the mechanisms underlying ICL by explicitly focusing on inter-example reasoning, potentially revealing deeper insights into how LLMs perform few-shot learning.
*   **Improving ICL Performance:** CICL aims to deliver more robust, sample-efficient, and reliable ICL, particularly valuable in low-resource scenarios or when context examples are imperfect.
*   **Novel Pretraining Paradigm:** It introduces a new direction for pretraining large models, integrating structured relational reasoning capabilities directly into the pretraining phase via contrastive learning.
*   **Alignment with Workshop Themes:** This work directly addresses core topics of the ICL 2024 workshop, including architectures, training paradigms, inductive biases enabling ICL, and empirical evaluation.
*   **Broader Impact:** Success in this research could lead to more capable and adaptable AI systems that learn more effectively from limited contextual information, impacting various applications from personalized assistants to scientific discovery tools.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Model Architecture: CICL Transformer**
We will start with a standard Transformer-based LLM architecture (e.g., similar to GPT-Neo/Llama). The key modification will be the introduction or adaptation of attention mechanisms to explicitly support cross-example comparisons.

*   **Input Formatting:** During both pretraining and inference, context examples will be formatted distinctly. A common approach involves concatenating examples with separators, e.g., `<SEP>Input1: X1 Output1: Y1<SEP>Input2: X2 Output2: Y2<SEP>...<SEP>Query: Q`.
*   **Cross-Example Attention:** We will explore variations of attention mechanisms that facilitate interaction *between* the representations of different examples. This could involve:
    *   **Structured Attention Masks:** Modifying the attention mask to allow tokens within one example's representation block to attend to tokens in other example blocks.
    *   **Example-Level Pooling:** Generating a summary representation for each example (e.g., averaging final layer hidden states corresponding to the example tokens, or using a special [CLS] token per example) and then applying a separate attention layer over these example-level representations.
    *   **Dedicated Cross-Example Heads:** Designating specific attention heads within certain layers to specialize in attending across example boundaries, potentially guided by modifications to the attention computation itself (inspired by Gonzalez et al., 2024).

The final hidden state corresponding to the query $Q$ (or specifically, the position where the output prediction is expected) will be used for downstream tasks, ideally enriched by the context processed through both standard self-attention and the cross-example attention mechanisms.

**3.2 Contrastive Pretraining Strategy**
The core of CICL lies in its pretraining objective. We propose augmenting the standard masked language modeling (MLM) or causal language modeling (CLM) objective with a self-supervised contrastive loss focused on inter-example relationships.

*   **Data:** We will use large-scale, diverse text corpora such as C4, The Pile, or refined subsets.
*   **Constructing Example Sets for Pretraining:** We need to simulate ICL prompts during pretraining. We can achieve this by:
    1.  Sampling multiple text snippets (e.g., sentences or paragraphs) from the corpus.
    2.  Heuristically assigning "Input" and "Output" roles or identifying implicit tasks (e.g., sentence completion, paraphrase identification, next-sentence prediction within a document).
    3.  Grouping these synthetic examples into sets $\{ (X_1, Y_1), (X_2, Y_2), ..., (X_k, Y_k) \}$.
*   **Defining Positive and Negative Pairs:** The crucial step is defining similarity for the contrastive loss. We propose exploring several strategies:
    *   **Task-Based Similarity:** If we can identify or synthetically create examples belonging to the same underlying task (e.g., multiple sentiment analysis examples generated from product reviews), these can form positive pairs. Examples from different tasks form negative pairs.
    *   **Semantic Similarity:** Use sentence embeddings (e.g., from a pretrained sentence-BERT) to find semantically similar $(X, Y)$ pairs to form positive sets, and dissimilar ones for negative sets.
    *   **Augmentation-Based Similarity:** Generate variations of an example $(X, Y)$ using data augmentation techniques (e.g., back-translation, paraphrasing) to create positive pairs. Negative pairs are simply other unrelated examples.
    *   **Structural Similarity:** Pair examples that demonstrate similar reasoning patterns (if such structure can be extracted, e.g., chain-of-thought patterns).
*   **Contrastive Loss Formulation:** Let $E = \{e_1, e_2, ..., e_k\}$ be a set of $k$ examples in the context, where $e_i = (X_i, Y_i)$. Let $h_i$ be the representation of example $e_i$ derived from the CICL model (e.g., pooled output from the cross-example attention layer or final hidden states). For an anchor example $e_a$, we sample or identify a positive example $e_p$ (conceptually similar) and a set of $N$ negative examples $E_{neg} = \{e_{n_1}, ..., e_{n_N}\}$ (conceptually dissimilar). We will primarily use the InfoNCE loss (Oord et al., 2018):
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{NCE} = - \mathbb{E} \left[ \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(h_a, h_p) / \tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(h_a, h_p) / \tau) + \sum_{e_{n_j} \in E_{neg}} \exp(\text{sim}(h_a, h_{n_j}) / \tau)} \right] $$
    where $\text{sim}(u, v) = u^T v / (\|u\| \|v\|)$ is the cosine similarity, and $\tau$ is the temperature hyperparameter. The expectation is over anchor examples and their corresponding positive/negative sets sampled from the pretraining data.
*   **Combined Training Objective:** The total loss will be a weighted combination of the standard language modeling loss ($\mathcal{L}_{LM}$) and the contrastive loss ($\mathcal{L}_{NCE}$):
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{LM} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{NCE} $$
    where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter balancing the two objectives.

**3.3 Inference-Time Example Selection**
Given a query $q$ and a candidate pool of examples $C = \{e_1, ..., e_M\}$, we need to select a subset $S \subset C$ of size $k$ to form the ICL prompt. The goal is to choose $S$ such that the model's prediction for $q$ given $S$ is optimal. We propose an algorithm that leverages the CICL representations:

1.  **Embed Query and Candidates:** Obtain representations $h_q$ for the query and $h_i$ for each candidate example $e_i \in C$ using the pretrained CICL model (potentially involving the cross-example attention mechanism in a preliminary pass or using pooled representations).
2.  **Selection Criteria:** Define a scoring function that promotes relevance, diversity, and potentially explicit contrast, inspired by the pretraining objective. Options include:
    *   **Relevance-Diversity Trade-off:** Maximize $\sum_{e_i \in S} \text{sim}(h_q, h_i) - \beta \sum_{e_i, e_j \in S, i \neq j} \text{sim}(h_i, h_j)$.
    *   **Contrastive Score:** Select examples that are individually relevant to the query but collectively span different facets, possibly maximizing a determinantal point process (DPP) score based on a kernel derived from similarity and dissimilarity learned during pretraining (inspired by Ye et al., 2023, but using CICL representations).
    *   **Greedy Selection:** Start with an empty set $S$. Iteratively add the example $e^* \in C \setminus S$ that maximizes an objective function, e.g., improvement in a combined score considering relevance to $q$ and relationship (similarity/dissimilarity) to already selected examples in $S$.
3.  **Prompt Construction:** Construct the final prompt using the selected examples $S$ and the query $q$.

**3.4 Experimental Design**
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **Standard LLM + Random Selection:** A baseline LLM (pretrained with only $\mathcal{L}_{LM}$) using randomly selected examples for ICL.
    2.  **Standard LLM + Similarity Selection:** The same baseline LLM using a standard similarity-based example selection (e.g., based on sentence-BERT embeddings).
    3.  **Contrastive Pretraining Baseline (Johnson et al., 2023 style):** An LLM pretrained with a general contrastive objective but without explicit cross-example attention or the proposed inter-example contrastive task.
    4.  **Inference-Time Contrastive Methods (e.g., ICCD-inspired):** Standard LLM using inference-time contrastive decoding (Peng et al., 2025).
    5.  **Cross-Example Attention Baseline (Gonzalez et al., 2024 style):** LLM with cross-example attention but only standard LM pretraining.
*   **Datasets and Tasks:** We will use a range of standard ICL benchmarks:
    *   **Classification:** Sentiment Analysis (SST-2), Topic Classification (AGNews), Natural Language Inference (RTE, CB from SuperGLUE).
    *   **Regression:** Semantic Textual Similarity (STS-B).
    *   **Few-Shot Evaluation:** Systematically vary the number of in-context examples $k \in \{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32\}$.
    *   **Robustness Evaluation:** Introduce noise into the example pool (e.g., incorrect labels, irrelevant examples) to test robustness.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   Classification: Accuracy, Macro-F1 score.
    *   Regression: Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients.
    *   Overall: Average performance across tasks. We will also report performance gains relative to baselines.
*   **Implementation Details:** We plan to use existing LLM frameworks (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers) and implement CICL based on a moderately sized model (e.g., 1B-7B parameters) to allow for feasible pretraining experiments. We will use standard hyperparameters for optimization (AdamW) and schedule the learning rate appropriately. Hyperparameters $\lambda$ and $\tau$ will be tuned on a validation set.
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    *   CICL vs. LM Pretraining only (evaluate impact of $\mathcal{L}_{NCE}$).
    *   CICL vs. CICL without cross-example attention (evaluate architecture contribution).
    *   CICL vs. CICL without informed example selection (evaluate inference strategy).
    *   Impact of different positive/negative sampling strategies during pretraining.
    *   Sensitivity analysis for hyperparameters $\lambda$ and $\tau$.
*   **Representation Analysis:** Visualize the learned representations $h_i$ using dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, UMAP) to qualitatively assess whether the contrastive objective successfully clusters similar examples and separates dissimilar ones based on the intended criteria (task, semantics). Analyze attention weights in the cross-example mechanism to see if they focus on meaningful inter-example comparisons.

1.  **CICL Model:** A pretrained LLM incorporating the novel contrastive objective and cross-example attention mechanism.
2.  **Performance Improvements:** We expect CICL to significantly outperform baseline models on various ICL tasks, particularly in few-shot settings ($k \le 8$) and scenarios with noisy context examples. We anticipate performance gains potentially in the range of 10-20% relative improvement over standard ICL baselines, aligning with preliminary ideas.
3.  **Effective Example Selection:** Demonstration of an inference-time example selection algorithm tailored for CICL that outperforms standard selection heuristics like random choice or simple semantic similarity.

For instance, demonstrating that CICL learns to differentiate between examples illustrating the same concept versus contrasting concepts.
6.  **Code & Models:** Release of open-source code for the CICL framework and potentially the pretrained model checkpoints to facilitate reproducibility and further research.
7.  **Publications:** Dissemination of findings through publications at top-tier machine learning conferences or workshops, such as ICL 2024.

**4.2 Impact**
*   **Scientific Impact:** This research will contribute to a deeper fundamental understanding of in-context learning by exploring the role of inter-example reasoning. It establishes a stronger link between contrastive representation learning and the algorithmic capabilities emerging in large models. It motivates a shift from viewing context examples merely as independent mappings to seeing them as a structured set whose internal relationships provide crucial learning signals.
*   **Technological Impact:** CICL has the potential to make LLMs more practical and reliable. By improving sample efficiency, fewer examples would be needed to adapt the model to new tasks, reducing prompt engineering effort and context length limitations. Enhanced robustness to noisy examples makes ICL more applicable in real-world scenarios where perfect demonstrations are scarce. This could benefit applications in personalized AI, rapid prototyping of NLP solutions, and low-resource language processing.
*   **Broader Significance:** This work aligns with the broader goal of creating more adaptable and efficient AI systems. By developing models that learn underlying principles from comparative examples, we move towards AI that reasons more flexibly and requires less explicit supervision, paving the way for more sophisticated and autonomous learning agents. Addressing the relationship between ICL and meta-learning (learning to learn from examples) is also a key contribution relevant to the workshop's themes.
