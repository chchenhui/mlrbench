**Key Challenges**:

1. **Quality and Representativeness of Context Examples**: Ensuring that the selected in-context examples are both high-quality and representative of the task is crucial. Poor example selection can lead to suboptimal model performance.

2. **Modeling Inter-Example Relationships**: Traditional ICL approaches often treat context examples independently, missing the opportunity to leverage relational structures between examples, which can enhance learning efficiency.

3. **Balancing Positive and Negative Examples**: Incorporating both correct and incorrect examples into the learning process is beneficial, but determining the optimal balance and selection strategy remains a challenge.

4. **Generalization Across Tasks and Domains**: Developing ICL methods that generalize well across diverse tasks and domains without additional training or fine-tuning is a significant hurdle.

5. **Interpretability and Bias in Multimodal Inputs**: Understanding the inner workings of ICL in large language models, especially when dealing with multimodal inputs, and addressing biases in input formatting are ongoing challenges.
