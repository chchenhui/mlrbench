*Architectural Inductive Biases for Efficient In-Context Learning in Transform**Motivation:****Motivation:**  
Current transformer-based LLMs exhibit strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, but the architectural components responsible for this remain poorly understood. Identifying and formalizing these inductive biases is critical to designing models that learn tasks more efficiently from context, reducing reliance on massive scale or data. This research addresses the gap between empirical success and theoretical grounding in ICL-enabling architectures.

**Main Idea:**  
This work proposes a systematic analysis of transformer components (e.g., attention mechanisms, layer norms, positional encodings) to isolate their contributions to ICL. Using controlled ablation studies across diverse tasks, we measure how each component affects few-shot adaptation. For example, replacing self-attention with static pooling or varying the structure of key-value memory in attention heads could reveal design principles for ICL efficiency. Theoretical analysis will connect these findings to gradient-based meta-learning, hypothesizing that certain attention mechanisms implicitly implement optimization in in-context examples. Expected outcomes include (1) a taxonomy of ICL-critical architectural features, (2) modified transformer variants with amplified biases for targeted tasks (e.g., algorithmic reasoning), and (3) guidelines for training protocols that enhance these biases. Successful results could yield smaller, more interpretable models tailored for rapid adaptation, advancing applications like on-the-fly personalization and safety-critical few-shot decision-making.
