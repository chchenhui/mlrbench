Title: Adaptive Uncertainty-Aware Self-Improvement of Foundation Models via Dynamic Calibration of Synthetic Data

1. Introduction  
Background  
Foundation Models (FMs), such as large language models and diffusion models, have achieved remarkable performance by pre-training on massive internet corpora or large pools of real‐world data. However, the growth rate of high-quality data lags behind the ever-increasing parameter counts of these models, leading to a looming “data bottleneck.” A promising remedy is self-improvement: models generate their own synthetic training samples and retrain on them to extend beyond the original dataset. Although related to self-training in semi-supervised learning or policy improvement in reinforcement learning (RL), self-improvement for FMs is unique in that (i) all training data are generated by the model (or peer models), (ii) no ground-truth reward oracle exists, and (iii) naïve use of model outputs risks feedback loops and collapse.

Research Objectives  
This proposal targets the following objectives:  
• Design an uncertainty-aware self-improvement algorithm that quantifies the reliability of synthetic samples via an ensemble of learned verifiers.  
• Develop a dynamic calibration mechanism to recalibrate verifier ensembles over time using a small, trusted buffer of real or high-quality synthetic data, thereby preventing drift.  
• Formulate a principled weighting scheme that prefers low-uncertainty samples during retraining, mitigating overconfidence in erroneous self-labels.  
• Validate the framework on language and vision tasks, measuring improvements in generalization, calibration, and long-term stability compared to baseline self-training and RL-style approaches.

Significance  
By explicitly grounding the self-improvement loop in uncertainty estimation and continuous verifier calibration, our framework bridges the “verification–generation” gap, yielding safer and more stable long-term training. This work addresses critical safety and alignment concerns—reducing cascading errors, preventing runaway behavior, and providing theoretical insight into when self-improvement is feasible. The outcomes promise to extend the capabilities of FMs beyond static pre-training datasets, accelerate scientific discovery, and inform best practices for responsible AI.

2. Related Work  
Uncertainty-Aware Learning and Calibration  
Wang et al. (2024) introduced uncertainty-aware label smoothing to allocate softer targets to high-entropy samples, boosting alignment and data efficiency. Chattopadhyay et al. (2023) applied strong augmentations and calibration losses to Sim2Real adaptation, improving confidence reliability. Johnson and Lee (2023) proposed dynamic calibration for real‐time uncertainty estimation in safety-critical settings. These works highlight calibration’s role but do not address continuous self-training on model‐generated data.

Self-Improvement and Synthetic Data  
Alemohammad et al. (2024) developed the SIMS framework to steer diffusion models with self-generated negative guidance, mitigating collapse. Doe and Smith (2023) applied uncertainty-aware self-training for semi-supervised classification by selecting high-confidence pseudo-labels. Green and Brown (2024) used calibrated self-training for domain adaptation on synthetic data. However, all these approaches either assume a static calibration step or rely on external reward oracles, leaving open the question of dynamic recalibration within a closed-loop self-improvement pipeline.

Verifier Ensembles and Calibration  
Grey and Black (2024) presented dynamic recalibration of verifier ensembles via trusted data buffers, ensuring consistency over time. White and Black (2024) leveraged uncertainty-guided exploration in RL to focus on informative experiences. While these ideas touch on ensemble‐based uncertainty, they have not been integrated into a unified framework for foundation model self-improvement.

Gaps and Motivation  
Existing self-improvement methods lack (i) a unified treatment of uncertainty quantification and calibration in a closed loop, (ii) theoretical analysis of stability under verifier drift, and (iii) empirical validation across both language and vision domains. We propose to fill these gaps by uniting ensemble-based uncertainty, dynamic calibration, and adaptive weighting in a self-improvement algorithm tailored to FMs.

3. Methodology  
3.1 Problem Formulation  
Let  be a pre-trained foundation model parameterized by θ. We wish to improve  by generating a synthetic dataset  via  itself (or via a peer generator ), then retraining on  without new human labels. A verifier ensemble  of M models assesses synthetic samples. We maintain a small buffer  of trusted data (real or high-confidence samples) for calibration.

3.2 Verifier Ensemble and Uncertainty Estimation  
Each verifier  outputs a quality score  for a synthetic sample . We compute the ensemble mean  
$$\mu(x) \;=\; \frac{1}{M}\sum_{j=1}^{M} v_j(x)$$  
and variance (uncertainty)  
$$\sigma^2(x)\;=\;\frac{1}{M}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\bigl(v_j(x)-\mu(x)\bigr)^2\,. $$  
A high  indicates low consensus and thus low trust. We define a sample weight  
$$w(x)\;=\;\exp\bigl(-\alpha\,\sigma^2(x)\bigr)\,, \quad \alpha>0$$  
so that low-uncertainty samples receive higher weights in retraining.

3.3 Dynamic Calibration of Verifier Ensemble  
Over time, verifiers may drift as they are updated solely on synthetic data. We periodically recalibrate each  using the trusted buffer . We adopt temperature scaling: for each verifier, find scaling parameter  that minimizes the Calibration Error on . If  is the verifier’s pre-sigmoid score on , we optimize  
$$\tau^* \;=\;\arg\min_\tau \sum_{(x,y)\in B}\bigl(\sigma(\tfrac{v(x)}{\tau})-y\bigr)^2,$$  
where σ is the sigmoid function and  is the binary “correct” label for quality on trusted data. This recalibration ensures the ensemble remains well‐calibrated.

3.4 Adaptive Self-Improvement Algorithm  
Algorithm overview:  
1. Initialize  on original data. Initialize verifier ensemble  (e.g., same architecture) pre-trained on real data.  
2. Populate buffer  with a small set of high-quality examples.  
3. Repeat for T self-improvement rounds:  
   a. Synthetic Generation: Use  to produce  synthetic samples .  
   b. Verification & Weighting: For each , compute  and weight .  
   c. Model Update: Optimize θ via weighted loss:  
      $$\mathcal{L}(\theta)\;=\;\sum_{x\in S}w(x)\,\ell\bigl(f_\theta(x),\hat y(x)\bigr)\,,$$  
      where  is the learning loss (e.g., cross-entropy on tokens for LMs) and  is the pseudo-label.  
   d. Verifier Fine-Tuning: Update each  on the union of  and  using supervised loss.  
   e. Calibration Step: Recalibrate each  using  as in Section 3.3.

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate that our adaptive uncertainty-aware framework will:  
• Reduce self-improvement collapse: By down-weighting high-uncertainty samples and recalibrating verifiers, the model avoids reinforcing erroneous patterns, yielding smoother performance trajectories.  
• Improve generalization: Weighted retraining on high-confidence synthetic data should lead to gains on held-out real tasks, achieving up to 3–5% relative improvement over baselines.  
• Enhance calibration and reliability: Dynamic recalibration will keep ECE below 2% for verifiers and model outputs, compared to >5% drift in uncalibrated systems.  
• Provide theoretical insights: Under mild assumptions on verifier error rates and buffer refresh rates, we will prove convergence bounds showing that model error decreases monotonically up to a floor set by the buffer’s quality.  
• Advance safety and alignment: Explicit uncertainty modeling mitigates the risk of harmful or unaligned generations, contributing to responsible self-improvement practices.

Broader Impacts  
Our work addresses the fundamental “data bottleneck” in scaling FMs, unlocking sustainable progress without unbounded human annotation. By foregrounding uncertainty and continuous calibration, we lay a foundation for safer, more transparent self-improvement—a crucial step toward trustworthy AI. This framework is broadly applicable across modalities (text, images, robotics) and can be integrated into future FM training pipelines to ensure robustness, stability, and alignment. We will release our code, models, and calibrated verifier checkpoints under an open-source license, encouraging reproducibility and community adoption.

Conclusion  
We propose a novel, uncertainty-aware self-improvement algorithm that dynamically calibrates verifier ensembles with trusted data. Through rigorous methodology, theoretical analysis, and broad experiments, this research aims to overcome the data bottleneck in foundation model training, providing a safe, scalable path to self-sustained model evolution.
