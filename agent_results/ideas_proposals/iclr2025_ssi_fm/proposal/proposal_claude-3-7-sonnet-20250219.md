# Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Self-Improvement via Dynamic Calibration of Synthetic Data

## Introduction

Foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, but their continued advancement faces a significant bottleneck: the finite nature of high-quality training data. As these models scale in size and complexity, the availability of suitable data for direct training via next-token prediction or other supervised learning approaches is diminishing. This challenge is particularly evident in large language models (LLMs), where projected gains from scaling up pre-training on internet data are smaller than those from incorporating specific test-time techniques. Similarly, in embodied intelligence and robotics, the scarcity of real-world data presents a substantial limitation.

Self-improvement, where models continually enhance their capabilities by training on self-generated or synthetic data, offers a promising solution to this data bottleneck. However, this paradigm introduces unique challenges that differentiate it from standard supervised and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Unlike supervised learning, which relies on high-quality human annotations, self-improvement frameworks must incorporate mechanisms for data curation within the learning process itself. While RL also involves training on model-generated data, generic RL algorithms may not be sufficiently tailored for the specific constraints of self-improvement, such as the absence of accurate reward oracles and the risk of model collapse due to the reinforcement of errors.

A critical challenge in self-improvement is the verification-generation gap, where models generate synthetic data that cannot be reliably verified for quality without external supervision. Current approaches often rely on imperfect verifier models or reward functions, leading to potential reinforcement of errors and model collapse over time. Moreover, these methods typically lack mechanisms to quantify and adapt to uncertainty in synthetic data validity, resulting in unreliable training signals and diminished performance.

This research proposes an Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Self-Improvement (AUSI) framework that addresses these challenges through dynamic calibration of synthetic data. By integrating calibrated uncertainty estimation, selective training on high-confidence samples, and periodic recalibration using a small buffer of trusted data, AUSI aims to enable stable, continuous improvement without human supervision. The framework leverages ensemble disagreement as an uncertainty signal and dynamically adjusts training procedures based on this uncertainty, thereby mitigating the risk of model collapse and ensuring reliable long-term performance.

The significance of this research extends beyond addressing the data bottleneck. By developing principled approaches to self-improvement, we contribute to the broader goals of AI alignment and safety. The proposed uncertainty-aware framework provides transparency into the reliability of synthetic data, enables more robust learning from self-generated examples, and helps prevent the reinforcement of undesirable behaviors or biases. Furthermore, by reducing dependence on human supervision, AUSI facilitates scaling of foundation models while maintaining or improving their performance and reliability.

## Methodology

### Overview

The AUSI framework consists of three main components: (1) an uncertainty-aware verification system, (2) an adaptive training mechanism, and (3) a dynamic recalibration procedure. These components work together to enable foundation models to improve continuously using self-generated data while maintaining stability and reliability.

### 1. Uncertainty-Aware Verification System

The first component addresses the challenge of assessing the quality of self-generated data without human supervision. We propose an ensemble-based approach that not only provides quality assessments but also quantifies uncertainty in these assessments.

#### 1.1 Verifier Ensemble Architecture

We construct an ensemble of $K$ verifier models $\{V_1, V_2, ..., V_K\}$, each trained to evaluate the quality of synthetic data. These verifiers can be implemented as:

1. Specialized classifier models trained to distinguish high-quality from low-quality examples
2. Reward models that assign quality scores to synthetic data
3. Variants of the foundation model itself, fine-tuned for verification tasks

For a given synthetic data point $x$, each verifier $V_i$ produces a quality score $q_i(x) \in [0, 1]$, where higher values indicate higher quality.

#### 1.2 Uncertainty Estimation

We leverage disagreement among verifiers as a signal of uncertainty. For each synthetic data point $x$, we calculate:

1. **Mean quality score**: $\mu(x) = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=1}^{K}q_i(x)$
2. **Variance across verifiers**: $\sigma^2(x) = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=1}^{K}(q_i(x) - \mu(x))^2$

The variance $\sigma^2(x)$ serves as our primary uncertainty metric. Additionally, we compute a confidence-adjusted quality score:

$$\tilde{q}(x) = \mu(x) \cdot \exp(-\beta \cdot \sigma^2(x))$$

where $\beta$ is a hyperparameter controlling the penalty for uncertainty.

#### 1.3 Uncertainty Calibration

To ensure that the uncertainty estimates are well-calibrated, we apply temperature scaling to the verifier outputs. For each verifier $V_i$, we adjust the raw scores $\hat{q}_i(x)$ using a temperature parameter $T_i$:

$$q_i(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\hat{q}_i(x)/T_i)}$$

The temperature parameters $\{T_1, T_2, ..., T_K\}$ are optimized on a small validation set of trusted data to ensure that the confidence scores reflect true probabilities of correctness.

### 2. Adaptive Training Mechanism

The second component determines how the foundation model learns from synthetic data based on uncertainty estimates.

#### 2.1 Uncertainty-Weighted Loss Function

For a foundation model $F$ with parameters $\theta$, we define an uncertainty-weighted loss function that prioritizes learning from high-confidence examples:

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \frac{1}{|D_s|}\sum_{x \in D_s} w(x) \cdot \ell(F_\theta, x)$$

where:
- $D_s$ is the set of synthetic data points
- $\ell(F_\theta, x)$ is the standard loss function for the model (e.g., cross-entropy for language models)
- $w(x)$ is an uncertainty-based weight defined as:

$$w(x) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \sigma^2(x) \leq \tau_l \\
\frac{\tau_h - \sigma^2(x)}{\tau_h - \tau_l} & \text{if } \tau_l < \sigma^2(x) < \tau_h \\
0 & \text{if } \sigma^2(x) \geq \tau_h
\end{cases}$$

where $\tau_l$ and $\tau_h$ are lower and upper thresholds for uncertainty.

#### 2.2 Curriculum Learning Strategy

We implement a curriculum learning approach that gradually increases the complexity and uncertainty of synthetic data used for training:

1. **Initial phase**: Train primarily on high-confidence synthetic data (low $\sigma^2(x)$)
2. **Intermediate phase**: Gradually introduce moderate-confidence data
3. **Advanced phase**: Selectively incorporate challenging examples with higher uncertainty

The progression through these phases is controlled by a schedule function $s(t)$ that adjusts the thresholds $\tau_l$ and $\tau_h$ based on training iteration $t$:

$$\tau_l(t) = \tau_l^0 \cdot (1 + \alpha \cdot s(t))$$
$$\tau_h(t) = \tau_h^0 \cdot (1 + \alpha \cdot s(t))$$

where $\tau_l^0$ and $\tau_h^0$ are initial thresholds, $\alpha$ is a scaling factor, and $s(t)$ increases monotonically with $t$.

#### 2.3 Uncertainty-Guided Data Augmentation

To enhance the diversity of synthetic data, we employ uncertainty-guided data augmentation techniques:

1. For low-uncertainty examples, apply minimal augmentation to preserve their high quality
2. For moderate-uncertainty examples, apply targeted augmentations that address potential weaknesses identified by verifier disagreement
3. For high-uncertainty examples, use them as negative examples or for contrastive learning

### 3. Dynamic Recalibration Procedure

The third component ensures the reliability of the verification system over time through periodic recalibration.

#### 3.1 Trusted Data Buffer

We maintain a small buffer $B$ of trusted, high-quality data points. This buffer can include:

1. A curated subset of the original training data
2. Synthetic data points that have been manually verified
3. Synthetic data with consistently high confidence across multiple verification methods

The buffer size is kept minimal (e.g., 0.1-1% of the model's training data) to reduce dependence on human supervision.

#### 3.2 Verifier Recalibration

To prevent verifier drift, we periodically recalibrate the verifier ensemble using the trusted data buffer:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{calib}}(\phi_i) = \sum_{x \in B} \text{BCE}(V_i(x; \phi_i), y_x)$$

where:
- $\phi_i$ are the parameters of verifier $V_i$
- $\text{BCE}$ is the binary cross-entropy loss
- $y_x$ is the ground truth quality label for trusted data point $x$

The recalibration frequency is adaptive, triggered when:
1. The mean variance across verifiers exceeds a threshold
2. The performance on periodic validation checks decreases
3. A fixed number of training iterations has elapsed

#### 3.3 Distribution Shift Detection

To identify potential distribution shifts that may affect verifier reliability, we implement a drift detection mechanism:

$$D_{\text{KL}}(P_{\text{ref}} || P_{\text{curr}}) > \delta$$

where $D_{\text{KL}}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, $P_{\text{ref}}$ is the reference distribution of verifier outputs on trusted data, $P_{\text{curr}}$ is the current distribution of verifier outputs, and $\delta$ is a threshold. When significant drift is detected, more aggressive recalibration is performed.
