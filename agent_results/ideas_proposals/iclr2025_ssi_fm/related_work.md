**2. Key Challenges**

1. **Model Collapse Due to Overconfidence:** Self-improvement systems risk model collapse when they become overconfident in erroneous self-generated data, leading to the reinforcement of inaccuracies.

2. **Unreliable Uncertainty Estimation:** Accurate quantification of uncertainty in synthetic data validity is challenging, and poor estimation can result in unreliable training and decision-making processes.

3. **Verifier Drift Over Time:** Verifier models may experience drift, reducing their effectiveness in assessing synthetic data quality and necessitating continuous recalibration to maintain reliability.

4. **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation:** Determining the optimal balance between exploring new, uncertain data and exploiting known, reliable data is complex and critical for effective self-improvement.

5. **Ensuring Generalization Across Domains:** Self-improvement frameworks must generalize well across different domains and tasks, which is challenging due to varying data distributions and task requirements.
