**Title:** Mutual Verification for Stable Self-Improvement in Foundation Models  

**Motivation:** Current self-improvement methods risk model collapse due to error accumulation when training on self-generated data. Ensuring data quality without human oversight is critical for scaling foundation models (FMs) in data-constrained domains like robotics and specialized NLP tasks.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a **mutual verification framework** where two FMs alternately generate and critique each otherâ€™s outputs. Each model acts as a generator (proposing synthetic data) and a verifier (evaluating quality via confidence scores or consistency checks). A dynamic thresholding mechanism selectively retains high-confidence, mutually verified outputs for training. To mitigate verifier biases, integrate lightweight ensemble verifiers trained on diverse proxy tasks. The framework includes theoretical analysis to establish conditions for stable convergence (e.g., bounded verification error rates). Expected outcomes: (1) Reduced degeneration in synthetic data, (2) Sustainable performance gains across self-training iterations. Potential impact: Enables autonomous FM scaling in domains with scarce human-labeled data while aligning outputs with desired behaviors through cooperative feedback.
