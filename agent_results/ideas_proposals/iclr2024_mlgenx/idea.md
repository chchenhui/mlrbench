1. **Title**: Causal Discovery through Multi-Omics Perturbation Analysis via Active Learning in Causal Graphical Models  
2. **Motivation**: Understanding causal relationships in genomics is critical for drug target identification but remains challenging due to confounding variables in observational data. Current methods often rely on correlations, leading to poor reproducibility and failed clinical trials. Advances in perturbation experiments (e.g., CRISPR, RNAi) and multimodal omics data offer opportunities to infer causality, but efficient integration of these data with interpretable models is lacking.  
3. **Main Idea**: We propose a framework combining causal graphical models with active learning to iteratively design perturbation experiments that maximize causal effect estimation. The method will: (1) learn latent causal representations from multimodal data (single-cell RNA, proteomics, spatial omics) using structured variational autoencoders; (2) identify causal relationships via interventional data through counterfactual reasoning; and (3) optimize experimental design using active learning to select perturbations that reduce uncertainty in causal graphs. Expected outcomes include interpretable causal networks linking genes, proteins, and phenotypes, validated on synthetic benchmarks and real datasets (e.g., LINCS, CRISPR screens). This approach could accelerate target discovery by prioritizing interventions with high causal confidence, reducing trial-and-error costs. The integration of uncertainty quantification and experimental feedback loops will enhance robustness, enabling scalable, hypothesis-driven drug development.
