Title: CausalGenVAE – A Variational Causal Representation Model for Multi-Omics Target Discovery

Motivation:  
Current multi-omics analyses largely capture correlations, not causation, leading to spurious target candidates and high downstream drug‐failure rates. Embedding explicit causal structure into representation learning can disentangle regulatory modules, prioritize true disease drivers and accelerate reliable target identification.

Main Idea:  
We propose CausalGenVAE, a hybrid Graph Neural Network–Variational Autoencoder framework that learns latent causal factors from genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics. A prior informed by known regulatory graphs guides the encoder to capture putative causal modules. Genetic variants (e.g. SNPs) serve as instrumental variables to regularize the latent space for causal inference. The decoder reconstructs multi-omics profiles, while a built-in do-operator simulator predicts the effects of in silico gene knockouts or over-expressions. Training optimizes an ELBO loss with an additional causal-consistency penalty. We will validate CausalGenVAE on public CRISPR perturbation datasets, benchmark target rankings against known disease genes and demonstrate improved robustness to confounders. By delivering interpretable, causally grounded representations, this approach promises more accurate and efficient drug target discovery.
