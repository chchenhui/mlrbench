### Title: Enhancing Drug Discovery Through Causal Representation Learning in Genomics

### Motivation
The lack of causal understanding in genomics hinders effective drug discovery. Current machine learning models often struggle to identify the underlying biological mechanisms, leading to the failure of many drug candidates. By developing causal representation learning techniques, we can better understand the causal relationships between genetic variations and diseases, significantly improving the success rate of drug discovery.

### Main Idea
This research proposes a novel approach to causal representation learning in genomics, focusing on identifying and modeling causal relationships between genetic variations and disease outcomes. The methodology involves:
1. **Data Integration**: Combining genomics data with clinical and phenotypic information to create a comprehensive dataset.
2. **Causal Discovery**: Employing advanced causal discovery algorithms, such as PC-algorithm and FCI, to identify causal relationships within the data.
3. **Modeling**: Developing a causal graph-based model to represent the identified relationships and predict disease outcomes.
4. **Validation**: Using cross-validation and external datasets to validate the model's predictive performance and generalizability.
5. **Interpretability**: Enhancing the model's interpretability through visualizations and explainability techniques to facilitate biological understanding.

Expected outcomes include a robust causal representation model that can predict disease outcomes based on genetic variations, leading to more targeted and effective drug discovery. This research has the potential to significantly accelerate the development of personalized medicines and improve patient outcomes.
