# Uncertainty-Aware Foundation Models for Genomic Sequence Design

## Motivation
Current genomic sequence design methods often produce deterministic outputs that fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in biological systems. This limitation hinders the development of reliable gene and cell therapies where understanding prediction confidence is crucial for clinical translation. Moreover, existing models struggle to quantify when they are operating in distribution versus extrapolating to novel genomic contexts. Addressing these limitations could dramatically improve our ability to design therapeutic sequences with predictable effects, reducing costly failures in drug development pipelines.

## Main Idea
We propose developing foundation models for genomic sequence design that explicitly model uncertainty through probabilistic encodings of the sequence space. By leveraging techniques from Bayesian deep learning and diffusion probabilistic models, our approach will generate diverse candidate sequences along with their associated confidence scores. The method will employ a two-phase architecture: (1) a pre-training phase on large-scale genomic data incorporating genomic context and evolutionary conservation signals, and (2) a fine-tuning phase that specializes in capturing uncertainty for specific therapeutic applications. The model will be validated through wet-lab experiments testing predicted sequence effects against measured outcomes, with a novel calibration framework ensuring that uncertainty estimates correlate with real-world performance variability. This approach promises more reliable sequence designs for gene therapies and RNA-based drugs, ultimately improving success rates in clinical translation.
