## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **Large Language Model-Guided Prior Elicitation for Efficient Bayesian Optimization**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Bayesian Optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful framework for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, finding widespread application in areas like hyperparameter tuning (Snoek et al., 2012), drug discovery (Martinez et al., 2024; Korovina et al., 2020), material science (Johnson & Williams, 2025; Seko et al., 2015), and experimental design (Gonzalez et al., 2016). BO operates by building a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), of the objective function and using an acquisition function to intelligently select the next point to evaluate, balancing exploration and exploitation. The efficiency of BO, particularly in the crucial initial stages when data is scarce, is highly sensitive to the quality of the prior assumptions encoded within the surrogate model (Brochu et al., 2010). A well-specified prior, particularly an informative one that accurately reflects existing knowledge about the function's behaviour (e.g., smoothness, lengthscales, relevant input dimensions), can significantly accelerate convergence towards the optimum, thereby reducing the number of costly function evaluations.

However, specifying informative priors is often a major bottleneck for practitioners (Garnett, 2023). Eliciting priors requires domain expertise and familiarity with the intricacies of probabilistic modeling, such as selecting appropriate kernel functions and setting their hyperparameters for GPs. This challenge is exacerbated in high-dimensional parameter spaces or for complex, non-stationary objective functions commonly encountered in scientific discovery and engineering tasks. Standard practice often resorts to using default, relatively uninformative priors (e.g., squared exponential kernel with fixed or broadly estimated hyperparameters), which may not capture the specific characteristics of the problem at hand, potentially leading to slow convergence and inefficient exploration. This limitation hinders the broader adoption of BO, especially in domains where function evaluations are extremely costly or time-consuming.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and synthesizing information from vast amounts of text, including scientific literature, code repositories, and domain-specific knowledge bases (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023). LLMs can process natural language descriptions, identify patterns, extract relevant information, and even generate structured outputs. This presents a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between human-readable domain knowledge and the mathematical formalism required for specifying BO priors. The ability of LLMs to distill complex information could potentially automate or semi-automate the prior elicitation process, making informative priors more accessible and improving BO efficiency.

This research proposal directly aligns with the themes of the Workshop on Bayesian Decision-making and Uncertainty. By leveraging LLMs to improve prior specification in BO, we aim to enhance decision-making under uncertainty (selecting the next evaluation point) by providing a more accurate initial model of the objective function. This directly addresses the challenge of incorporating prior knowledge into Bayesian methods and explores the opportunity presented by frontier models (LLMs) to enhance established Bayesian techniques, particularly for applications involving expensive evaluations where uncertainty quantification and efficient exploration are paramount.

**2.2 Research Problem and Proposed Solution**
The central research problem we address is the difficulty and expertise required in specifying informative priors for Bayesian Optimization, which limits its practical efficiency, especially in complex, resource-constrained settings. We propose a novel framework, **LLM-Guided Prior Elicitation for Bayesian Optimization (LLM-BO-PE)**, where a Large Language Model is employed to automatically generate informative prior specifications for the GP surrogate model based on a natural language description of the optimization problem.

Our core idea is that an LLM, prompted with textual information describing the target function (e.g., its expected smoothness, underlying physical principles), the optimization domain (e.g., variable bounds, constraints), known relevant input dimensions, and potentially referencing relevant scientific literature or experimental context, can C its latent knowledge to suggest suitable parameters for the GP prior. This includes recommendations for:
*   Appropriate kernel function(s) reflecting function characteristics (e.g., smoothness, periodicity).
*   Plausible ranges or point estimates for kernel hyperparameters (e.g., lengthscales, signal variance, noise variance).
*   Identification of potentially irrelevant input dimensions (for Automatic Relevance Determination - ARD).
*   Potentially suggesting a simple mean function if prior trends are known.

This LLM-generated prior will serve as the initial configuration for the GP model within a standard BO loop, effectively "bootstrapping" the optimization process with distilled knowledge, guiding the exploration towards more promising regions of the search space from the outset.

**2.3 Related Work Context**
The intersection of LLMs and Bayesian Optimization is a rapidly developing area. Several recent works explore synergistic integrations. For instance, AutoElicit (Capstick et al., 2024) uses LLMs for prior elicitation in general predictive modeling, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to encode knowledge. LLAMBO (Liu et al., 2024) integrates the LLM *within* the BO loop, using it to iteratively propose candidates based on past evaluations, effectively enhancing the acquisition process rather than solely focusing on the initial prior. Zeng et al. (2025) leverage LLMs in a multi-task setting, fine-tuning the LLM on past BO trajectories to generate better initial *points* for new tasks. Chen et al. (2024) use LLMs within BO for analog circuit design to generate parameter *constraints*.

Our proposed work is distinct yet complementary. While acknowledging these valuable contributions, our specific focus is on leveraging the LLM's ability to interpret *natural language problem descriptions* (potentially including unstructured text from papers or reports) to directly inform the *initial prior specification* (kernel choice, hyperparameter ranges) of the GP surrogate model *before* the BO loop begins. This addresses the fundamental challenge of setting up the BO problem effectively, particularly for users who may lack deep expertise in GP modeling. Several concurrent preprints (Doe & Smith, 2024; Johnson & Williams, 2025; Davis & Brown, 2024; Lee & Kim, 2025; Martinez & Wilson, 2024) explore similar ideas, confirming the timeliness and relevance of this research direction. Our work aims to provide a systematic methodology and rigorous empirical evaluation of this specific approach, addressing key challenges like the reliability and structured generation of priors.

**2.4 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:
1.  Develop a systematic framework (LLM-BO-PE) for translating natural language descriptions of optimization problems into structured GP prior specifications using LLMs.
2.  Design effective prompting strategies and output parsing mechanisms to reliably elicit meaningful prior parameters (kernel type, hyperparameter ranges/values, relevant dimensions) from an LLM.
3.  Integrate the LLM-generated priors into a standard Bayesian Optimization framework.
4.  Empirically evaluate the performance of LLM-BO-PE against standard BO practices (uninformative priors) and other relevant baselines on a suite of benchmark optimization tasks and simulated real-world problems.
5.  Analyze the impact of LLM-generated priors on BO convergence speed, measured primarily by the reduction in the number of required function evaluations to reach a target performance level.
6.  Investigate the sensitivity of the approach to the choice of LLM, the quality/detail of the natural language input, and the complexity of the optimization problem.

**2.5 Significance**
This research holds significant potential benefits:
*   **Increased BO Efficiency:** By providing more informative priors, LLM-BO-PE aims to accelerate the convergence of BO, saving substantial computational resources or experimental costs in expensive optimization scenarios (e.g., scientific discovery, engineering design).
*   **Improved Accessibility:** Automating prior elicitation can lower the barrier to entry for using BO effectively, enabling researchers and practitioners without deep expertise in probabilistic modeling to leverage its power.
*   **Enhanced Knowledge Integration:** Provides a novel pathway for integrating unstructured domain knowledge (from text, literature) into the formal BO framework.
*   **Contribution to LLM+AI:** Explores a new application of LLMs in augmenting established AI/ML algorithms, contributing to the understanding of how LLMs can act as "knowledge components" within larger systems.
*   **Alignment with Workshop Goals:** Directly tackles challenges in Bayesian decision-making by improving the foundational surrogate model through better prior knowledge incorporation, leveraging frontier AI capabilities (LLMs).

**3. Methodology**

Our proposed methodology consists of three main components: (1) LLM-based Prior Elicitation Module, (2) Integration with Bayesian Optimization Loop, and (3) Experimental Validation.

**3.1 LLM-Based Prior Elicitation Module**

This module takes a natural language description of the optimization problem and outputs a structured prior specification for the GP surrogate model.

*   **Input:** A natural language prompt containing:
    *   Description of the objective function: e.g., "optimizing the yield of a chemical reaction," "tuning hyperparameters of a deep neural network," "designing a material with high conductivity".
    *   Known characteristics: e.g., "expected to be smooth," "likely periodic with respect to parameter X," "sensitive to parameters A and B, less so to C," "potentially non-stationary".
    *   Input domain: Variable names, ranges, and types (continuous, discrete, categorical). Explicit constraints.
    *   Context: Optionally, snippets from relevant literature, problem background, or desired properties of the optimum.
*   **LLM Processing:**
    *   **Model Selection:** We will initially leverage a state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3, Llama 3) known for strong reasoning and instruction-following capabilities. We may explore fine-tuning smaller, domain-specific models later if necessary, although the primary focus is on leveraging general pre-trained models via prompting.
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** This is a critical step. The prompt will be carefully designed to guide the LLM towards extracting relevant information and structuring its output. It will explicitly ask the LLM to suggest:
        1.  **Kernel Function:** Recommend a suitable kernel from a predefined list (e.g., RBF/Squared Exponential, Matérn family (ν=3/2, 5/2), Periodic, Rational Quadratic) based on described function properties (smoothness, differentiability, periodicity). Justification for the choice should be requested.
        2.  **Hyperparameter Ranges/Values:** For the chosen kernel(s), suggest plausible initial ranges or point estimates for key hyperparameters:
            *   Lengthscale(s) ($l$): A single value or range if isotropic; potentially different ranges for different dimensions if ARD is suggested, reflecting perceived sensitivity.
            *   Signal Variance ($\sigma_f^2$): Range reflecting expected magnitude of function variation.
            *   Noise Variance ($\sigma_n^2$): Range reflecting expected observation noise (if applicable/known).
            *   For Matérn kernels, potentially justification for the smoothness parameter ($\nu$).
        3.  **Mean Function:** Suggest a simple mean function (e.g., constant, linear) if the description implies a known trend, otherwise default to zero mean.
        4.  **Relevant Dimensions (Optional):** Identify input dimensions expected to be most influential, potentially informing ARD priors.
    *   **Output Parsing:** The LLM output, even if structured, will be text. We will develop robust parsing scripts (e.g., using regular expressions, structured output prompting like JSON mode if available) to extract the suggested kernel type, hyperparameter ranges/values, and mean function details into a machine-readable format suitable for initializing a GP library (e.g., GPyTorch, BoTorch). We will handle cases where the LLM might provide ambiguous or incomplete information (e.g., fallback to default ranges).

*   **Prior Specification:** The GP prior assumes the objective function $f(\mathbf{x})$ follows a Gaussian Process:
    $$ f(\mathbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(\mathbf{x}), k(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}')) $$
    where $m(\mathbf{x})$ is the mean function and $k(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}')$ is the kernel (covariance) function.
    *   The LLM output directly informs the choice of $k$ (e.g., selecting Matérn-5/2).
    *   The LLM output provides initial values or priors (e.g., Gamma or Log-Normal distributions centered around suggested ranges) for the hyperparameters $\theta$ of $k$ (e.g., lengthscale $l$, signal variance $\sigma_f^2$) and the likelihood noise variance $\sigma_n^2$. For instance, if ARD is used, $k(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = \sigma_f^2 \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{d=1}^D \frac{(x_d - x_d')^2}{l_d^2}\right)$, the LLM might suggest ranges for each $l_d$.
    *   The LLM suggests the form of $m(\mathbf{x})$ (typically $m(\mathbf{x})=0$ or $m(\mathbf{x})=c$).

**3.2 Integration with Bayesian Optimization Loop**

The LLM-generated prior is used to initialize the BO process. The standard BO loop then proceeds as follows:

1.  **Initialization:** Evaluate the objective function $f$ at a small number of initial points $D_0 = \{(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n_0}$, where $y_i = f(\mathbf{x}_i) + \epsilon_i$ and $\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_n^2)$. These points can be chosen randomly or via a space-filling design (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling).
2.  **GP Model Fitting:** Fit a GP model to the current data $D_t = \{(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^{t}$. This involves optimizing the GP hyperparameters ($\theta$, $\sigma_n^2$) by maximizing the marginal likelihood.
    *   **Crucially, the LLM-generated prior specifications are used here:**
        *   The selected kernel structure is fixed.
        *   The optimization of hyperparameters starts from the LLM-suggested values or uses the suggested ranges to define priors within a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) or fully Bayesian (MCMC) inference framework for the hyperparameters. This contrasts with standard BO, which might start from arbitrary values or use wide, uninformative priors.
3.  **Acquisition Function Optimization:** Select the next point $\mathbf{x}_{t+1}$ to evaluate by maximizing an acquisition function $\alpha(\mathbf{x} | D_t)$, which balances exploration (sampling in regions of high uncertainty) and exploitation (sampling where the model predicts good values). Common choices include:
    *   Expected Improvement (EI): $\alpha_{EI}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}[\max(0, f(\mathbf{x}^*) - f(\mathbf{x}))]$
    *   Upper Confidence Bound (UCB): $\alpha_{UCB}(\mathbf{x}) = \mu(\mathbf{x}) + \beta \sigma(\mathbf{x})$
    We will primarily use EI or UCB, as they are standard and well-understood. The choice will be kept consistent across comparisons.
    $$ \mathbf{x}_{t+1} = \arg \max_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}} \alpha(\mathbf{x} | D_t) $$
4.  **Function Evaluation:** Query the expensive black-box function $f$ at $\mathbf{x}_{t+1}$ to obtain $y_{t+1}$.
5.  **Augment Data:** Add the new pair $(\mathbf{x}_{t+1}, y_{t+1})$ to the dataset: $D_{t+1} = D_t \cup \{(\mathbf{x}_{t+1}, y_{t+1})\}$.
6.  **Repeat:** Increment $t$ and return to Step 2 until a budget of function evaluations is exhausted or a convergence criterion is met.

**3.3 Experimental Design**

We will conduct rigorous experiments to validate the effectiveness of LLM-BO-PE.

*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **Standard BO:** Using a common default prior (e.g., Matérn-5/2 kernel with fixed median-heuristic lengthscales or broadly optimized hyperparameters based only on initial $n_0$ points, zero mean).
    2.  **Random Search:** Evaluating points randomly within the domain (a common naive baseline).
    3.  **Expert-Defined Prior BO (Optional/If Feasible):** If possible for some benchmark problems, BO with a prior set by a human expert familiar with the function.
    4.  **(Potential Advanced Baseline):** Compare against methods like LLAMBO (Liu et al., 2024) if feasible and source code is available, though the setup is different (LLM in the loop vs. prior elicitation).

*   **Tasks/Datasets:**
    1.  **Synthetic Benchmark Functions:** Standard functions used in BO literature (e.g., Branin, Hartmann6, Ackley, Levy) with varying dimensionality and characteristics (smoothness, modality). For these, we can craft natural language descriptions mimicking real-world knowledge (e.g., "a smooth function with multiple local minima," "function most sensitive to first two dimensions"). This allows controlled evaluation as the ground truth optimum is known.
    2.  **Simulated Real-World Problems:**
        *   *Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO):* Tuning hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength) of standard ML models (e.g., SVM, RandomForest, potentially a small NN) on benchmark datasets (e.g., UCI datasets). The natural language description would include the model type, dataset characteristics, and target metric (e.g., validation accuracy).
        *   *Simulated Material/Drug Discovery Task:* Use established simulation environments or surrogate benchmarks from these fields (e.g., optimizing molecular properties using a predefined simulator or benchmark dataset like QM9 property prediction). The description would cover desired properties, chemical space constraints, etc.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Convergence Speed:** Primary metric: Plot the best function value found so far against the number of function evaluations. We will measure the *Immediate Regret* $r_t = f(\mathbf{x}^*) - f(\mathbf{x}_t^+)$ or *Cumulative Regret* $R_T = \sum_{t=1}^T r_t$, where $f(\mathbf{x}^*)$ is the true maximum (if known) or best value found across all runs/methods, and $f(\mathbf{x}_t^+)$ is the best value observed after $t$ evaluations. We hypothesize LLM-BO-PE will achieve lower regret faster.
    2.  **Number of Evaluations to Threshold:** Number of function evaluations required to reach a predefined performance level (e.g., 95% of the true optimum).
    3.  **Computational Overhead:** Measure the time taken for the LLM prior generation step (usually negligible compared to expensive function evaluations) and the GP fitting step (to ensure LLM priors don't unduly complicate inference).
    4.  **Quality of Generated Priors (Qualitative):** Analyze the priors generated by the LLM. How reasonable are the suggested kernels and hyperparameter ranges compared to ground truth (for synthetic functions) or expert knowledge?

*   **Experimental Setup:**
    *   Each experiment (method + task combination) will be repeated multiple times (e.g., 20-30 runs) with different random seeds for initial points and BO choices to ensure statistical robustness.
    *   Results will be reported using mean performance curves with standard error/deviation bands.
    *   Statistical significance tests (e.g., t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests) will be used to compare performance between LLM-BO-PE and baselines at specific evaluation budgets.
    *   We will investigate sensitivity by varying the level of detail in the natural language prompts and potentially comparing different LLMs.

The successful completion of this research project is expected to have a significant impact:
*   **Accelerating Scientific Discovery and Engineering:** By making BO more efficient, especially when function evaluations correspond to physical experiments, complex simulations, or costly computations (e.g., wet-lab experiments in biology/chemistry, tuning large-scale simulations in physics/climate science, optimizing complex engineering designs), this work can accelerate progress in various scientific and industrial domains.
*   **Democratizing Bayesian Optimization:** Lowering the expertise barrier for effective BO deployment enables a wider range of researchers and practitioners to benefit from its advantages in optimizing complex systems.
*   **Advancing Human-AI Collaboration:** This research serves as a case study in leveraging the complementary strengths of human intuition/knowledge (expressed in natural language) and machine learning algorithms (BO's systematic exploration), facilitated by LLMs as translators.
*   **Informing Bayesian Methodology:** Contributes to the broader field of Bayesian statistics and machine learning by providing a novel, data-driven approach to prior elicitation, a long-standing challenge in Bayesian inference.
*   **Addressing Workshop Themes:** Directly contributes to the workshop's focus by showcasing a novel integration of LLMs with Bayesian methods to improve decision-making under uncertainty in resource-constrained optimization problems, highlighting both the potential and challenges of this synergy.

By addressing the critical bottleneck of prior specification, LLM-BO-PE has the potential to unlock significant efficiency gains in applying Bayesian optimization to challenging real-world problems, fostering innovation across multiple disciplines.
