# Title: Large Language Model-Guided Prior Elicitation for Bayesian Optimization

## Introduction

### Background

Bayesian Optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful technique for optimizing complex, expensive-to-evaluate functions. However, its efficiency heavily relies on the quality of the prior, typically encoded in a Gaussian Process (GP). Specifying informative priors is challenging, especially for non-experts or in high-dimensional spaces, limiting BO's applicability in complex scientific discovery tasks where function evaluations are expensive. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present an opportunity to address this challenge by automatically eliciting informative priors for BO.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. To develop a method that leverages LLMs to automatically generate informative priors for BO.
2. To evaluate the performance of LLM-generated priors in various benchmark optimization tasks and real-world applications.
3. To assess the impact of LLM-generated priors on the efficiency and effectiveness of the BO process.

### Significance

Automatically eliciting informative priors using LLMs can significantly enhance the performance of BO in complex scientific discovery tasks. By focusing exploration on more promising areas identified through the LLM's distilled knowledge, this approach can lead to faster convergence and reduced computational costs. Furthermore, this research can contribute to the broader understanding of integrating LLMs with probabilistic modeling techniques to address uncertainty and decision-making challenges in AI and ML.

## Methodology

### Research Design

#### Data Collection

The research will utilize benchmark optimization datasets and real-world datasets from domains such as hyperparameter tuning, material design, and drug discovery. These datasets will be used to evaluate the performance of LLM-generated priors in various contexts.

#### LLM-Based Prior Elicitation

The LLM will be prompted with a natural language description of the optimization problem, including details such as the target function characteristics, domain constraints, and any relevant scientific literature. The LLM will then generate parameters for the prior distribution, such as suggesting relevant input dimensions, appropriate kernel types, and hyperparameter ranges for the GP surrogate model.

#### Bayesian Optimization Framework

The BO framework will use the LLM-generated prior to bootstrap the optimization process. The GP surrogate model will be trained using the LLM-generated prior and iteratively updated with new observations. The BO algorithm will then use this model to select the most promising points to evaluate next, focusing exploration on more promising areas identified through the LLM's distilled knowledge.

### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the LLM-generated priors will be evaluated using the following metrics:
1. **Convergence Speed**: Measured by the number of function evaluations required to achieve a target performance level.
2. **Optimization Accuracy**: Measured by the final optimized value of the target function.
3. **Exploration Efficiency**: Measured by the diversity and coverage of the explored regions in the optimization space.
4. **Computational Cost**: Measured by the total computational resources required for the optimization process.

### Experimental Design

The research will follow a structured experimental design to validate the method. The experiments will be conducted in three phases:

1. **Benchmark Experiments**: The method will be evaluated on a set of standard benchmark optimization datasets, such as the Branin function, Rosenbrock function, and Ackley function.
2. **Real-World Experiments**: The method will be applied to real-world optimization problems, including hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models, material design, and drug discovery.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: The performance of the LLM-generated priors will be compared with standard priors, such as uninformative priors and priors elicited by domain experts.
