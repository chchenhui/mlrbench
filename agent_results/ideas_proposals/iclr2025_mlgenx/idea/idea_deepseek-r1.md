**Title:** Agentic AI for Guided Genomic Perturbation Design Using Retrieval-Augmented LLMs and Lab-in-the-Loop Learning  

**Motivation:** Current AI models in genomics often lack domain-specific biological context and struggle to adapt iteratively with experimental feedback, limiting their utility in identifying causal disease mechanisms. Bridging this gap is critical for accelerating gene therapy design and reducing costly trial-and-error cycles.  

**Main Idea:** Develop an LLM-powered agent that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a curated biological knowledge graph to propose targeted genomic perturbations (e.g., CRISPR edits). The system will employ active learning to prioritize perturbations based on uncertainty estimates and experimental feasibility, then refine its predictions via reinforcement learning with human and lab feedback (RLHF). By connecting to automated lab tools, the agent iteratively updates its knowledge base and model parameters, improving target hypotheses for downstream validation. Expected outcomes include a framework for dynamic, interpretable perturbation planning and a benchmark dataset linking AI-proposed edits to multi-omics readouts. This approach could streamline gene therapy discovery by reducing redundant experiments and surfacing novel biological insights.
