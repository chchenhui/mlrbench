**Title:** Causal Representation Learning for Disentangling Disease Mechanisms in Single-Cell Omics

**Motivation:** Identifying causal drivers of disease progression from observational single-cell omics data is hampered by confounding factors and high dimensionality. Understanding true causal relationships, rather than mere correlations, between cellular states, gene expression patterns, and disease phenotypes is crucial for effective target identification and therapeutic development.

**Main Idea:** We propose developing a causal representation learning framework tailored for single-cell RNA-seq data. The framework will integrate variational autoencoders (VAEs) with principles from causal inference (e.g., structural causal models, do-calculus inspired interventions in latent space). The goal is to learn disentangled latent representations where specific latent variables correspond to distinct causal factors (e.g., cell type identity, disease state progression, technical noise, treatment effect). By enforcing specific independence constraints and potentially incorporating limited interventional data (e.g., perturbations), the model will aim to identify causal gene regulatory networks or cell state transitions underlying disease pathology. Expected outcomes include robust identification of causal drivers suitable for therapeutic targeting and improved interpretability of single-cell disease atlases.
