### Title: Leveraging Graph Neural Networks for Uncovering Biological Pathways in Single-Cell RNA Analysis

### Motivation:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and biological processes. However, the sheer volume and complexity of scRNA-seq data pose significant challenges in identifying meaningful biological pathways and interactions. Existing methods often struggle with capturing the intricate relationships and long-range dependencies within the data. This research aims to address these challenges by leveraging advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to uncover hidden biological pathways and improve the interpretability of scRNA-seq data.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research will develop a novel GNN-based framework tailored for scRNA-seq data analysis. The framework will incorporate cell-cell interactions and gene-gene relationships to create a comprehensive graph representation of the biological system. This representation will be fed into a GNN model, which will learn to identify key biological pathways and interactions. The methodology involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare scRNA-seq data by normalizing and filtering the expression profiles.
2. **Graph Construction**: Construct a graph where nodes represent cells or genes, and edges represent interactions inferred from co-expression patterns or known biological pathways.
3. **GNN Training**: Train a GNN model on the graph to learn node embeddings that capture the complex relationships within the data.
4. **Pathway Discovery**: Use the learned embeddings to identify and visualize key biological pathways and interactions.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the GNN framework using benchmark datasets and biological validation.

Expected outcomes include improved pathway identification, enhanced interpretability of scRNA-seq data, and the discovery of new biological insights. The potential impact is significant, as it will contribute to a deeper understanding of cellular processes and facilitate the development of targeted therapies for various diseases.
