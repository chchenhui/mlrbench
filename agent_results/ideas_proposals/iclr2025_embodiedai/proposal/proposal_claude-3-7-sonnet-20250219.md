# UrbanVerse: A Dynamic, Multi-Agent Simulator and Benchmark Suite for Embodied LLM Agents in Open City Environments

## 1. Introduction

### Background
The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized numerous domains of artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in language understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. However, there remains a significant gap in the application of these models to embodied intelligence in complex, dynamic real-world environments—particularly in open urban settings. Current embodied AI research predominantly focuses on static indoor environments or simplified outdoor scenarios, failing to capture the intricate dynamics, spatial complexity, and multi-agent interactions characteristic of urban landscapes.

Urban environments present unique challenges for embodied agents: they must navigate complex spatial layouts, adapt to dynamic elements (pedestrians, vehicles, changing weather conditions), interpret diverse sensory inputs, and engage in both planned and reactive decision-making. While humans navigate these challenges effortlessly, combining spatial intelligence with contextual understanding and real-time adaptation, LLM-powered agents often struggle with these embodied tasks despite their sophisticated language capabilities.

Recent research initiatives like EmbodiedCity (Gao et al., 2024), CityEQA (Zhao et al., 2025), and CityBench (Feng et al., 2024) have begun addressing these challenges by developing platforms for urban AI evaluation. However, these platforms typically focus on specific aspects of urban intelligence rather than providing a comprehensive ecosystem for developing and evaluating embodied LLM agents across multiple dimensions of urban intelligence.

### Research Objectives
This research proposes the development of UrbanVerse, an integrated simulator and benchmark suite specifically designed to advance embodied intelligence with LLMs in open city environments. Our objectives are to:

1. Create a high-fidelity, dynamic urban simulation platform that leverages real-world geographic information system (GIS) data to generate diverse, interactive cityscapes with realistic environmental variations and multi-agent dynamics.

2. Develop a standardized API framework that enables seamless integration of various LLM architectures with the simulator, providing consistent interfaces for perception, reasoning, planning, and action execution.

3. Design a comprehensive benchmark suite with carefully crafted tasks that evaluate different dimensions of embodied urban intelligence, including spatial reasoning, navigation, multi-agent coordination, and adaptability to dynamic conditions.

4. Generate and curate datasets combining synthetic trajectories with real-world urban activity patterns to support both training and evaluation of embodied LLM agents.

5. Establish rigorous evaluation metrics and protocols that assess not only task completion but also efficiency, safety, adaptability, and human-like behavior in urban settings.

### Significance
UrbanVerse addresses a critical gap in the current AI research landscape by providing the infrastructure needed to advance embodied LLM agents in realistic urban contexts. Its significance is multifaceted:

First, it will accelerate research progress by offering a standardized, reproducible environment for testing and comparing different approaches to embodied urban intelligence, fostering scientific rigor in a rapidly evolving field.

Second, it will promote the development of more robust and versatile AI systems capable of operating effectively in complex, dynamic environments—a prerequisite for practical applications in autonomous vehicles, smart city management, urban delivery, emergency response, and assistive technologies.

Third, by integrating multiple aspects of urban intelligence into a unified platform, UrbanVerse will encourage cross-disciplinary approaches that combine insights from computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, urban planning, and cognitive science.

Finally, the platform will serve as a bridge between theoretical advances in language models and practical embodied applications, helping to solve the "last mile" problem of deploying AI systems in real-world environments where they must interact with both physical reality and human participants.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 UrbanVerse Simulator Architecture

#### 2.1.1 Core Simulation Engine
The UrbanVerse simulator will be built on a modular architecture with four primary components:

1. **Geographic Information System (GIS) Integration Layer**: This component will:
   - Ingest and process OpenStreetMap and satellite imagery data to create detailed 3D city models
   - Incorporate building footprints, road networks, elevation data, and land use information
   - Support procedural generation to create diverse urban environments based on real-world patterns

2. **Environmental Dynamics Engine**: This component will simulate:
   - Weather conditions (rain, snow, fog) affecting visibility and mobility
   - Time-of-day variations with appropriate lighting and activity patterns
   - Seasonal changes affecting environment appearance and agent behaviors

3. **Agent Simulation System**: This system will:
   - Model diverse autonomous agents (pedestrians, vehicles, cyclists) with behavior models
   - Implement crowd dynamics using social force models enhanced with goal-directed behavior
   - Support variable agent densities and behavioral profiles based on urban context

4. **Physics and Interaction Engine**: This engine will:
   - Provide realistic physics for movement, collisions, and environmental interactions
   - Simulate sensory feedback (visual, auditory, proprioceptive) for embodied agents
   - Enable environmental interactions (entering buildings, using transportation, manipulating objects)

The system will be implemented using a combination of Unity3D for the visual rendering and physics simulation, with custom C++ modules for high-performance agent behavior simulation and Python interfaces for LLM integration.

#### 2.1.2 Urban Environment Generation
UrbanVerse will support three types of urban environments:

1. **Real-World City Replicas**: Accurate digital twins of specific urban areas (e.g., Manhattan, San Francisco downtown) created using:
   $$E_r = f_{GIS}(G_r, S_r, B_r, T_r)$$
   Where $E_r$ is the resulting environment, $f_{GIS}$ is the GIS processing function, $G_r$ represents the geospatial data, $S_r$ the street-level imagery, $B_r$ the building information, and $T_r$ the topographical data.

2. **Procedurally Generated Cities**: Synthetic urban environments created following statistical distributions of real urban patterns:
   $$E_s = f_{proc}(P_u, D_p, S_p, C_p)$$
   Where $E_s$ is the synthetic environment, $f_{proc}$ is the procedural generation function, $P_u$ represents urban planning patterns, $D_p$ population density parameters, $S_p$ street layout parameters, and $C_p$ cultural/regional characteristics.

3. **Hybrid Environments**: Combinations of real and synthetic elements to test generalization:
   $$E_h = \alpha E_r + (1-\alpha) E_s + \Delta E$$
   Where $E_h$ is the hybrid environment, $\alpha$ controls the balance between real and synthetic elements, and $\Delta E$ represents novel elements introduced to test agent adaptability.

### 2.2 LLM Agent Integration Framework

#### 2.2.1 Perception-Action Interface
UrbanVerse will provide a standardized API for embodied LLM agents with the following components:

1. **Multimodal Observation Stream**: Agents will receive:
   - Visual input (RGB images, depth maps, segmentation masks)
   - Spatial information (position, orientation, map data)
   - Semantic information (object/agent identification, signage content)
   - Environmental state (weather, time, traffic conditions)

   The observation at time $t$ can be represented as:
   $$O_t = \{I_t, D_t, S_t, P_t, M_t, E_t\}$$
   Where $I_t$ represents visual imagery, $D_t$ depth information, $S_t$ segmentation data, $P_t$ positional data, $M_t$ map information, and $E_t$ environmental conditions.

2. **Action Space**: Agents will control:
   - Movement (continuous translation and rotation)
   - Interaction (object manipulation, communication)
   - Information gathering (focused attention, querying)

   The action space can be formalized as:
   $$A = A_{move} \times A_{interact} \times A_{perceive}$$

3. **Language Interface**: LLMs will communicate with the environment through:
   - Natural language commands for high-level planning
   - Structured output for precise action execution
   - Language-based perception summaries and queries

#### 2.2.2 LLM Agent Architecture
The framework will support various agent architectures, with a reference implementation structured as:

1. **Perception Module**: Processes multimodal inputs into language-based representations:
   $$L_t = f_{percept}(O_t, M_{mem})$$
   Where $L_t$ is the language representation of observations, and $M_{mem}$ is the agent's memory state.

2. **Reasoning & Planning Module**: LLM-powered reasoning over observations and goals:
   $$P_t = f_{LLM}(L_t, G, M_{mem}, K)$$
   Where $P_t$ is the generated plan, $G$ represents goals, and $K$ represents knowledge retrieval.

3. **Action Generation Module**: Converts plans to executable actions:
   $$a_t = f_{action}(P_t, O_t, M_{mem})$$
   Where $a_t$ is the specific action to execute at time $t$.

4. **Memory System**: Maintains episodic and semantic memory:
   $$M_{mem}^{t+1} = f_{update}(M_{mem}^t, O_t, a_t, r_t)$$
   Where $r_t$ represents feedback or rewards received after action execution.
