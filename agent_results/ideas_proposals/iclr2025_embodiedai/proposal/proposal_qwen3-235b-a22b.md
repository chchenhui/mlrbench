# UrbanVerse: A Dynamic, Multi-Agent Simulator and Benchmark Suite for Embodied LLM Agents in Open City Environments  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Embodied intelligence in open urban environments remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs) and their agent implementations. While recent advancements in embodied AI have focused on static or indoor environments, real-world cities demand dynamic, multi-agent coordination under unpredictable conditions such as traffic, weather, and stochastic events (e.g., accidents). Existing simulators like *EmbodiedCity* (Chen et al., 2024) and *CityNav* (Johnson et al., 2024) provide foundational tools but lack comprehensive support for dynamic interactions and large-scale outdoor scenarios. Furthermore, benchmarks such as *CityEQA* (Zhao et al., 2025) and *CityBench* (Feng et al., 2024) highlight the limitations of LLMs in long-horizon planning and real-time decision-making.  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop **UrbanVerse**, a dynamic, multi-agent simulator and benchmark suite for embodied LLM agents in open city environments. The objectives are:  
1. **Simulator Design**: Create a high-fidelity urban environment using real-world geographic information system (GIS) data, incorporating dynamic agents (pedestrians, vehicles), environmental variability (weather, time-of-day), and stochastic events.  
2. **Benchmark Development**: Define tasks for evaluating spatial reasoning (e.g., multi-step navigation), collaborative planning (e.g., emergency response), and robustness under uncertainty.  
3. **Integration with LLM Agents**: Enable API-driven interaction between LLM agents and the simulator for perception, navigation, and decision-making.  
4. **Dataset Curation**: Combine synthetic trajectories and real-world urban activity logs to train and evaluate agents.  

### Significance  
UrbanVerse will address the scarcity of tools for testing embodied LLMs in complex outdoor settings. By simulating realistic urban dynamics, it will advance applications such as autonomous delivery, emergency response systems, and smart city management. The benchmark suite will standardize evaluation metrics, fostering reproducibility and progress in embodied AI research.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Simulator Design  

#### Dynamic Urban Environment Generation  
UrbanVerse will leverage GIS data (e.g., OpenStreetMap) to generate 3D cityscapes with roads, buildings, and landmarks. Dynamic elements will include:  
- **Agent Populations**: Pedestrians and vehicles modeled using agent-based simulation. Vehicle trajectories will follow traffic rules and congestion patterns derived from real-world datasets (e.g., PeMS).  
- **Environmental Variability**: Weather (rain, fog), time-of-day (lighting changes), and seasonal effects (e.g., snow) will be simulated using procedural generation.  
- **Stochastic Events**: Randomly injected disruptions (e.g., road closures, accidents) to test agent adaptability.  

**Mathematical Model for Traffic Dynamics**:  
Vehicle movements will be governed by a modified social force model (Helbing & Molnár, 1995):  
$$
\frac{d^2\vec{r}_i}{dt^2} = \frac{\vec{v}_i^0 - \vec{v}_i(t)}{\tau} + \sum_{j \in \text{neighbors}} \vec{F}_{ij} + \vec{F}_{\text{obstacle}},
$$  
where $\vec{r}_i$ is the position of vehicle $i$, $\vec{v}_i^0$ its desired velocity, $\tau$ a relaxation time, and $\vec{F}_{ij}$ represents interactions with other agents.  

#### API Integration for LLM Agents  
LLM agents will interact with UrbanVerse via RESTful APIs, receiving observations (e.g., LiDAR, camera feeds, GPS) and outputting actions (e.g., move, stop, communicate). A modular interface will support integration with frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers and NVIDIA Omniverse.  

### 2.2 Benchmark Tasks  

#### Task 1: Multi-Step Navigation with Temporal Constraints  
Agents must navigate from a start to a goal location while adhering to time windows (e.g., "reach the hospital within 15 minutes"). Metrics include:  
- **Path Efficiency**: $\text{PE} = \frac{\text{Optimal Path Length}}{\text{Agent Path Length}}$.  
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of trials completed within the time limit.  

#### Task 2: Collaborative Emergency Response  
Multiple agents must coordinate to evacuate victims during a simulated disaster (e.g., fire). Metrics include:  
- **Rescue Efficiency**: $\text{RE} = \frac{\text{Victims Rescued}}{\text{Total Victims}}$.  
- **Collaboration Cost**: Total communication steps and task conflicts.  

#### Task 3: Robustness Under Stochastic Events  
Agents face random disruptions (e.g., sudden road closures). Metrics include:  
- **Adaptability Score**: Change in task completion time pre- and post-disruption.  
- **Recovery Time**: Time to replan and resume the original goal.  

### 2.3 Dataset Curation  

#### Synthetic Trajectory Generation  
Trajectories for pedestrians and vehicles will be synthesized using a combination of:  
- **Random Waypoint Model**: For pedestrian movement:  
  $$
  \vec{v}(t) = \begin{cases} 
  \frac{\vec{r}_{\text{dest}} - \vec{r}(t)}{\|\vec{r}_{\text{dest}} - \vec{r}(t)\|} \cdot v_{\text{max}}, & \text{if } \|\vec{r}_{\text{dest}} - \vec{r}(t)\| > \epsilon \\
  0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$  
- **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)**: For vehicle traffic simulations calibrated to real-world flow data.  

#### Real-World Data Integration  
Datasets like NYC Taxi Trips and PeMS will be processed into spatio-temporal logs for training and evaluation.  

### 2.4 Experimental Design  

#### Baseline Models  
- **LLM Agents**: GPT-4, Llama-3, and CityEQA’s PMA agent (Zhao et al., 2025).  
- **Non-LLM Baselines**: Traditional path planners (A*, RRT) and reinforcement learning agents (PPO, DQN).  

#### Evaluation Protocol  
- **Ablation Studies**: Assess the impact of dynamic elements (e.g., weather) on performance.  
- **Multi-Agent Scalability**: Test collaboration efficiency with 2–10 agents.  
- **Stress Testing**: Expose agents to extreme scenarios (e.g., blizzard conditions).
