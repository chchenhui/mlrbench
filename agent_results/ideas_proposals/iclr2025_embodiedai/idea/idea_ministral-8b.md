### Title: Enhancing Embodied Intelligence in Large Language Models via Multi-Modal Perception and Spatial Reasoning

### Motivation
Human beings effortlessly navigate and understand open environments, a task that remains challenging for large language models (LLMs). The workshop aims to address this gap by exploring techniques to enhance the spatial intelligence and perception capabilities of LLMs in outdoor settings. This research is crucial for developing autonomous agents that can perform complex tasks in real-world scenarios, such as navigation, search, and planning.

### Main Idea
The proposed research focuses on integrating multi-modal perception and spatial reasoning into LLMs to improve their performance in open city environments. The methodology involves:
1. **Multi-Modal Perception**: Enhancing LLMs with visual, auditory, and tactile sensors to perceive the environment holistically.
2. **Spatial Reasoning**: Developing algorithms that enable LLMs to reason about spatial relationships, distances, and paths in dynamic outdoor settings.
3. **Simulation and Testing**: Creating realistic simulators and testbeds to evaluate the performance of these enhanced LLMs.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved navigation and spatial reasoning capabilities in LLMs.
- Enhanced decision-making and action planning in outdoor environments.
- Development of effective multi-agent collaboration strategies.

Potential impact:
- Advancements in autonomous systems for navigation, search, and rescue.
- Improved human-agent collaboration in outdoor applications.
- Creation of new benchmarks and datasets for evaluating embodied intelligence in LLMs.
