**Title: Interpretable Neural Operators for Transparent Scientific Discovery with Differential Equations**

**Motivation:**  
AI-driven solutions for differential equations (DEs) often lack transparency, limiting trust and utility in scientific domains like climate modeling or material design. Understanding *why* a model generates specific solutions is critical for validation, hypothesis generation, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Current neural operators (e.g., FNOs, DeepONets) prioritize performance over explainability, creating a barrier to adoption in rigorous scientific workflows.

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a framework combining neural operators with intrinsic and post-hoc interpretability methods to solve DEs while generating human-understandable explanations. The approach integrates:  
1. **Symbolic-Neural Hybrid Models:** Sparse, interpretable symbolic expressions (via sparse regression) approximate globally influential terms in DE solutions, while neural networks capture fine-grained residuals.  
2. **Attention-Driven Feature Attribution:** Trainable attention layers in neural operators identify spatiotemporal regions or input parameters (e.g., boundary conditions) most critical to the solution.  
3. **Counterfactual Explanations:** Generate perturbations to inputs (e.g., initial conditions) and trace their effects on solutions, highlighting causal relationships.  

Validation involves benchmarking on PDEs (e.g., Navier-Stokes, heat equations) against traditional solvers and existing neural operators, measuring both accuracy and explanation quality (e.g., domain expert evaluations). Expected outcomes include scalable DE solvers with quantifiable uncertainty and intuitive explanations, bridging the gap between data-driven efficiency and scientific interpretability. This could accelerate AI adoption in high-stakes domains like climate prediction or biomedical engineering.
