1. **Title**: **HyperPINN: Physics-Guided Neural Networks for Efficient PDE Solving via Learned Hyperparameter Optimization**  

2. **Motivation**:  
Solving high-resolution partial differential equations (PDEs) in scientific domains like climate modeling or fluid dynamics remains computationally expensive despite advances in AI-based solvers (e.g., Physics-Informed Neural Networks, PINNs). Traditional numerical methods suffer from scalability issues, while PINNs struggle with slow convergence due to manual hyperparameter tuning. This limits their applicability to real-time or multi-scale simulations. A principled approach to automate hyperparameter optimization in PINNs could unlock orders-of-magnitude gains in efficiency.  

3. **Main Idea**:  
We propose *HyperPINN*, a meta-learning framework where a secondary neural network (the "HyperNetwork") dynamically generates hyperparameters (e.g., loss weights, learning rate schedules) for the primary PINN during training. The HyperNetwork is trained on a curated dataset of PDEs with known solutions to learn mappings between PDE properties (e.g., nonlinearity, boundary conditions) and optimal hyperparameter trajectories. This decouples hyperparameter search from PINN training, avoiding costly retraining. Methodologically, we combine differentiable hyperparameter learning with gradient-based meta-optimization. Expected outcomes include 5–10× speedups in PDE solution times compared to standard PINNs, with downstream impacts for real-time scientific simulations. By enabling adaptive hyperparameter control, HyperPINN bridges the gap between data-driven learning and physics-based modeling, advancing the practical use of AI in high-fidelity scientific computing.
