# Interpretable Neural Operators for Transparent Scientific Discovery with Differential Equations

## 1. Introduction

The ability to solve differential equations (DEs) efficiently and accurately stands at the core of scientific computing and engineering. Differential equations model a wide range of physical phenomena including fluid dynamics, heat transfer, electromagnetic wave propagation, and climate systems. Traditional numerical methods, while theoretically sound, often struggle with computational complexity when handling high-dimensional problems, multi-scale physics, or complex geometries.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly neural operators such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning the solution maps of differential equations directly from data. These approaches offer substantial computational advantages over classical numerical methods, enabling rapid solution approximation once trained. However, a critical limitation persists: the inherent black-box nature of these neural approaches obscures the underlying physical relationships and scientific principles, creating a significant barrier to adoption in scientific domains where understanding causality and physical mechanisms is paramount.

### Research Objectives

This research aims to develop a comprehensive framework for interpretable neural operators that maintain high computational efficiency while providing transparent, physically meaningful explanations of their predictions. Specifically, our objectives are to:

1. Design a hybrid symbolic-neural architecture that integrates interpretable symbolic expressions with deep neural networks to capture both global physical principles and complex local behaviors in differential equation solutions.

2. Implement attention-based mechanisms that highlight the most influential spatiotemporal regions and input parameters contributing to specific solution features.

3. Develop a counterfactual explanation system that quantifies how perturbations in initial/boundary conditions or system parameters affect solution trajectories.

4. Validate the framework on benchmark partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and other scientific domains, assessing both numerical accuracy and explanation quality.

### Significance

The proposed research addresses a fundamental gap between the computational efficiency of AI-driven differential equation solvers and the interpretability requirements of scientific discovery. By creating explainable neural operators, we enable:

1. **Enhanced Scientific Trust**: Domain scientists can verify that AI solutions adhere to known physical principles and boundary conditions.

2. **Knowledge Discovery**: Interpretable models may reveal new patterns or relationships in complex systems that were previously unnoticed.

3. **Error Detection**: Transparent explanation mechanisms facilitate identification of prediction failures or physical inconsistencies.

4. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Explainable models provide a common language between AI researchers and domain scientists.

5. **Integration with Existing Scientific Workflows**: Interpretable results can more readily complement and extend traditional scientific methods.

The outcomes of this research would significantly advance the field of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) by creating a bridge between the efficiency of neural approaches and the transparency required for scientific validation and discovery, particularly in high-stakes domains like climate modeling, materials science, and biomedical engineering.

## 2. Methodology

Our approach integrates three complementary components to create interpretable neural operators: symbolic-neural hybrid modeling, attention-driven feature attribution, and counterfactual explanation generation. This section details the design and implementation of each component, along with the training and evaluation procedures.

### 2.1 Symbolic-Neural Hybrid Architecture

We propose a novel architecture that decomposes the solution map of differential equations into interpretable symbolic components and a neural residual component.

#### 2.1.1 Problem Formulation

Let us consider a parametric PDE of the form:
$$\mathcal{L}[u; \lambda](x, t) = f(x, t; \lambda)$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is a differential operator, $u(x, t; \lambda)$ is the solution, $\lambda$ represents parameters or coefficients, $x \in \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is the spatial coordinate, and $t \in [0, T]$ is time. The goal is to learn the solution operator $\mathcal{G}: \lambda \mapsto u(\cdot, \cdot; \lambda)$ that maps parameters to solutions.

#### 2.1.2 Symbolic Component

We employ sparse regression techniques to identify a symbolic expression that approximates the global behavior of the solution. Specifically, we construct a library of candidate functions $\Phi(x, t, \lambda) = [\phi_1(x, t, \lambda), \phi_2(x, t, \lambda), ..., \phi_K(x, t, \lambda)]$ that includes polynomial terms, trigonometric functions, and other domain-specific basis functions.

The symbolic component $u_s$ is then represented as:
$$u_s(x, t; \lambda) = \sum_{i=1}^K c_i \phi_i(x, t, \lambda)$$

where $c_i$ are sparse coefficients determined through a regularized optimization problem:
$$\min_{c} \|u_{\text{data}} - \Phi c\|_2^2 + \alpha \|c\|_1$$

Here, $\alpha$ is a regularization parameter that controls sparsity, and $u_{\text{data}}$ represents training data generated using traditional numerical solvers or experimental measurements.

#### 2.1.3 Neural Residual Component

The neural component $u_n$ is designed to capture complex, localized features that are not easily represented by symbolic expressions. We implement this using a neural operator architecture based on DeepONet or FNO, which learns the mapping:
$$u_n = \mathcal{G}_{\theta}(\lambda)(x, t)$$

where $\theta$ represents the trainable parameters of the neural network.

#### 2.1.4 Integration Strategy

The final solution is represented as:
$$u(x, t; \lambda) = u_s(x, t; \lambda) + u_n(x, t; \lambda)$$

To encourage the symbolic component to capture the most physically relevant aspects of the solution, we implement a two-stage training process:
1. First, train the symbolic component to approximate the global behavior
2. Then, train the neural component to capture the residual, with a progressive weighting scheme that initially emphasizes the symbolic component's importance

### 2.2 Attention-Driven Feature Attribution

To identify which input features (spatial regions, temporal points, or parameters) most strongly influence the predicted solution, we incorporate attention mechanisms into the neural operator architecture.

#### 2.2.1 Spatial-Temporal Attention

For FNO-based implementations, we introduce an attention layer that operates in the spatial-temporal domain:
$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

where $Q$, $K$, and $V$ are learned query, key, and value representations derived from the input features. The attention weights quantify the relative importance of different regions in space and time.

#### 2.2.2 Parameter Attention

For parameters $\lambda$, we implement a separate attention mechanism:
$$\alpha_{\lambda} = \text{softmax}(W_{\lambda}\lambda + b_{\lambda})$$

where $\alpha_{\lambda}$ represents the relative importance of different parameters, and $W_{\lambda}$ and $b_{\lambda}$ are trainable weights and biases.

#### 2.2.3 Visualization of Attention Maps

We extract and visualize the attention weights to produce heat maps that highlight the most influential regions or parameters. These visualizations provide an intuitive explanation of which factors most strongly affect specific aspects of the solution.

### 2.3 Counterfactual Explanations

To explain the causal relationships between inputs and outputs, we develop a counterfactual explanation framework that analyzes how changes in inputs affect the predicted solution.

#### 2.3.1 Sensitivity Analysis

We compute the sensitivity of the solution with respect to input parameters using automatic differentiation:
$$S_{\lambda_i}(x, t) = \frac{\partial u(x, t; \lambda)}{\partial \lambda_i}$$

These sensitivity maps indicate which regions of the solution are most affected by changes in specific parameters.

#### 2.3.2 Counterfactual Generation

We generate counterfactual examples by systematically perturbing input parameters:
$$\lambda' = \lambda + \delta \lambda$$

For each perturbation, we compute the corresponding solution $u(x, t; \lambda')$ and analyze the differences from the original solution. The counterfactual analysis reveals:
- How boundary condition changes affect solution behavior
- The impact of parameter variations on specific features (e.g., vortices, shocks)
- Critical thresholds where qualitative changes in solution behavior occur

### 2.4 Integration and Training Procedure

The complete interpretable neural operator framework integrates all three components—symbolic-neural hybrid, attention mechanism, and counterfactual analysis—into a unified architecture.

#### 2.4.1 Loss Function

The training process minimizes a composite loss function:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}} + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{phys}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{sparse}} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{consist}}$$

where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}} = \|u_{\text{data}} - (u_s + u_n)\|_2^2$ is the prediction loss
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{phys}} = \|\mathcal{L}[u_s + u_n; \lambda] - f\|_2^2$ is the physics-informed loss ensuring the solution satisfies the differential equation
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{sparse}} = \|c\|_1$ is the sparsity loss on symbolic coefficients
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{consist}} = \|u_s(x', t'; \lambda') - u_s(x, t; \lambda)\|_2^2$ is a consistency loss for the symbolic component under similar conditions

#### 2.4.2 Training Algorithm

1. Initialize the symbolic component by fitting sparse coefficients to training data
2. Pre-train the neural component on the residual between data and symbolic predictions
3. Jointly fine-tune both components using the composite loss function
4. Train the attention mechanisms to identify influential features
5. Calibrate the counterfactual generation process

### 2.5 Experimental Design

We will validate our approach on several benchmark PDEs with varying complexity:

#### 2.5.1 Test Cases
1. **Heat Equation**: $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u$ with varying diffusivity $\alpha$

3. **Navier-Stokes Equations**: Incompressible flow with varying Reynolds numbers
4. **Reaction-Diffusion Systems**: $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 u + f(u)$ with different reaction terms $f(u)$

#### 2.5.2 Data Generation

For each test case, we will generate training, validation, and test datasets using:
1. High-fidelity numerical simulations with validated solvers
2. Varying parameters, initial conditions, and boundary conditions
3. Different spatial and temporal resolutions to assess generalization

#### 2.5.3 Evaluation Metrics

We will evaluate our approach using both quantitative and qualitative metrics:

**Accuracy Metrics:**
- Relative L2 error: $\frac{\|u_{\text{true}} - u_{\text{pred}}\|_2}{\|u_{\text{true}}\|_2}$
- Maximum pointwise error: $\max_{x,t} |u_{\text{true}}(x,t) - u_{\text{pred}}(x,t)|$
- Physics compliance: $\|\mathcal{L}[u_{\text{pred}}; \lambda] - f\|_2$

**Interpretability Metrics:**
- Symbolic component sparsity: Number of non-zero terms in the symbolic expression
- Feature attribution clarity: Concentration of attention weights (measured by entropy)
- Expert evaluation: Domain experts will rate the quality and relevance of explanations
- Counterfactual fidelity: Consistency between predicted effects of perturbations and actual effects

**Computational Efficiency:**
- Training time
- Inference time
- Memory requirements

#### 2.5.4 Comparison Baselines

We will compare our approach against:
1. Traditional numerical solvers (finite difference, finite element, spectral methods)
2. Standard neural operators (FNO, DeepONet) without interpretability components
3. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
4. Other interpretable ML approaches adapted to the PDE context
