**1. Title:** **Interpretable Neural Operators for Transparent Scientific Discovery with Differential Equations**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
The intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computational science, often termed Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), is rapidly transforming scientific discovery [Workshop Background]. Particularly impactful is the application of AI, specifically deep learning, to solve complex ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs) that underpin phenomena across diverse scientific domains like climate modeling, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), materials science, and biomedical engineering [Workshop Background]. Traditional numerical solvers (e.g., Finite Difference, Finite Element, Finite Volume methods) can be computationally prohibitive, especially for high-resolution simulations, parametric studies, inverse problems, or uncertainty quantification tasks.

Neural operators, such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) [Li et al., 2020] and DeepONets [Lu et al., 2021], have emerged as powerful data-driven surrogates. These operators learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling them to approximate the solution operator of a DE family. They offer significant speedups compared to traditional solvers once trained and can predict solutions for new input functions (e.g., initial conditions, boundary conditions, forcing terms, or physical parameters) efficiently [Workshop Background]. Recent advancements include variations like Laplace Neural Operators (LNOs [1]) addressing non-periodicity, RiemannONets [2] tailored for specific problems, and localized kernel approaches [6] improving local feature capture. Transformers are also being explored for their operator learning capabilities [7].

However, a major impediment to the widespread adoption and trust of these powerful tools in rigorous scientific practice is their inherent "black-box" nature [Idea Motivation]. While achieving high accuracy, the internal mechanisms by which these networks arrive at a solution are often opaque. This lack of transparency hinders:
*   **Validation:** Scientists cannot easily verify if the model adheres to underlying physical principles or if its accuracy stems from spurious correlations.
*   **Hypothesis Generation:** Understanding *why* a model predicts a certain outcome can lead to new scientific insights and hypotheses, a crucial aspect currently underdeveloped.
*   **Trust and Reliability:** In high-stakes applications (e.g., climate prediction, medical simulations), decisions cannot solely rely on models whose reasoning processes are inscrutable.
*   **Debugging and Improvement:** Identifying failure modes or areas for model enhancement is difficult without understanding internal representations.

Recent efforts have begun exploring interpretability in SciML contexts. Some works focus on designing inherently more interpretable architectures, such as those leveraging Laplace transforms [1], disentangled representations [3], polynomial bases [8], or specific structures [9]. Others aim for deriving symbolic expressions, either directly from data or via neuro-symbolic approaches [4, 5, 8]. However, a comprehensive framework that integrates multiple facets of interpretability directly into the neural operator workflow for solving DEs remains an open area.

**2.2 Research Objectives**
This research aims to develop and validate a novel framework for interpretable neural operators designed to solve differential equations while providing transparent, human-understandable explanations for their predictions. The primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Hybrid Symbolic-Neural Operator Framework:** Construct a model architecture that decomposes the solution prediction into a sparse, globally interpretable symbolic component and a neural network component capturing residual complexities.
2.  **Integrate Attention Mechanisms for Spatiotemporal/Parametric Attribution:** Incorporate trainable attention layers within the neural operator to automatically identify and highlight the input regions (spatiotemporal locations) or parameters (coefficients, boundary conditions) most influential in determining specific features of the solution.
3.  **Implement Counterfactual Explanation Generation:** Develop methods to generate and analyze counterfactual predictions by systematically perturbing input functions or parameters, thereby revealing causal dependencies between inputs and solution characteristics.
4.  **Evaluate the Framework Rigorously:** Systematically benchmark the proposed interpretable neural operator against standard neural operators (FNO, DeepONet) and traditional numerical solvers on a set of representative PDE problems, evaluating both predictive accuracy and the quality/utility of the generated explanations.
5.  **Assess Interpretability via Domain Expertise:** Collaborate with domain experts to evaluate the clarity, trustworthiness, and scientific utility of the explanations generated by the different interpretability components (symbolic, attention, counterfactuals).

**2.3 Significance**
This research directly addresses the critical need for explainability and interpretability in AI models applied to scientific problems, a key topic highlighted by the AI4DifferentialEquations workshop [Workshop Background]. By bridging the gap between the computational efficiency of neural operators and the interpretive rigor required in scientific discovery, this work holds significant potential impact:

*   **Enhanced Trust and Adoption:** Transparent models are more likely to be trusted and adopted by the scientific community, accelerating the integration of AI into scientific workflows.
*   **Facilitation of Scientific Insight:** Explanations generated by the model can help scientists understand complex DE solutions better, potentially leading to new discoveries or refined physical models. Understanding *why* a certain flow pattern emerges or *which* boundary condition dominates heat transfer can be as valuable as the prediction itself.
*   **Improved Model Development:** Interpretability tools can aid in diagnosing model failures, understanding generalization capabilities [3], and guiding the incorporation of domain knowledge [Literature Review - Challenge 5].
*   **Contribution to Explainable AI (XAI):** The project will contribute novel XAI techniques specifically tailored to the functional input/output nature of operator learning and the context of differential equations.
*   **Advancing SciML Frontiers:** By tackling the interpretability challenge [Literature Review - Challenge 1], this work pushes the boundaries of SciML, enabling more sophisticated and reliable AI-driven scientific exploration in fields reliant on DE modeling.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework**
We propose an Interpretable Neural Operator (INO) framework that learns the solution operator $\mathcal{G}: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{U}$ mapping input functions $a \in \mathcal{A}$ (e.g., initial conditions, boundary conditions, forcing terms, PDE coefficient functions) to solution functions $u \in \mathcal{U}$, i.e., $u = \mathcal{G}(a)$. The INO framework integrates three complementary interpretability approaches: a symbolic-neural decomposition, attention-based attribution, and counterfactual reasoning.

Let $a(x)$ represent generic input functions defined over a spatial domain $\Omega$ (possibly including time), and $u(x)$ be the corresponding solution function. The INO approximates $\mathcal{G}$ as $\mathcal{G}_{\theta}$, parameterized by $\theta$.

**3.2 Component 1: Symbolic-Neural Hybrid Model**
The core idea is to decompose the learned operator's output $u(x) \approx \mathcal{G}_{\theta}(a)(x)$ into two parts:

$$
u(x) \approx u_{sym}(x; \theta_{sym}) + u_{res}(x; \theta_{nn})
$$

where:
*   $u_{sym}(x; \theta_{sym})$ is an interpretable symbolic component designed to capture global trends or dominant physics. It is represented by a sparse combination of predefined basis functions (e.g., polynomials, Fourier modes, wavelets, or domain-specific functions $\phi_k(x)$):
    $$
    u_{sym}(x; \theta_{sym}) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} c_k \phi_k(x)
    $$
    The coefficients $c_k$ are part of the learned parameters $\theta_{sym}$. Sparsity is crucial for interpretability and will be encouraged via L1 regularization on the coefficients $c_k$. The basis functions $\phi_k$ can be fixed a priori or learned adaptively, potentially informed by the DE structure [cf. 4, 8]. The coefficients $c_k$ themselves might depend on the input $a$, possibly through a small network or a projection mechanism: $c_k = f_k(a; \theta_{sym}')$.
*   $u_{res}(x; \theta_{nn})$ is a neural network component designed to capture the remaining fine-grained details or complex localized phenomena not easily represented by the sparse symbolic part. This residual network could be a simpler version of an FNO or DeepONet, or potentially a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) applied locally, parameterized by $\theta_{nn}$.

**Training:**
The parameters $\theta = (\theta_{sym}, \theta_{nn})$ will be learned jointly by minimizing a composite loss function on a dataset of input-output pairs $\{(a_i, u_i^*)\}_{i=1}^N$, where $u_i^*$ is the ground-truth solution obtained via high-fidelity numerical simulation:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \| \mathcal{G}_{\theta}(a_i) - u_i^* \|_{\mathcal{U}}^2 + \lambda_{sym} \| \theta_{sym} \|_1 + \lambda_{reg} (\| \theta_{sym} \|_2^2 + \| \theta_{nn} \|_2^2)
$$

Here, $\| \cdot \|_{\mathcal{U}}$ denotes a suitable norm in the solution space (e.g., L2 norm over the domain $\Omega$), $\| \theta_{sym} \|_1$ is the L1 norm encouraging sparsity in the symbolic coefficients $c_k$, and the last term is standard L2 regularization. $\lambda_{sym}$ and $\lambda_{reg}$ are hyperparameters controlling the trade-off between accuracy, sparsity, and model complexity.

**Interpretation:** The symbolic part $u_{sym}$ provides a direct, human-readable approximation of the dominant solution behavior. The relative magnitude of $\|u_{sym}\|$ vs. $\|u_{res}\|$ indicates how much of the solution is captured by the interpretable part.

**3.3 Component 2: Attention-Driven Feature Attribution**
To understand which parts of the input $a(x)$ or which spatiotemporal locations $x$ are most critical for predicting the solution $u(x)$ at specific points, we will integrate attention mechanisms [Vaswani et al., 2017] into the neural component $u_{res}$ (or potentially integrate it within a unified operator architecture if the strict residual approach is modified).

**Mechanism:**
*   **Self-Attention:** For understanding dependencies within the solution domain, self-attention layers can be incorporated into the network predicting $u_{res}$. The attention weights $\alpha_{ij}$ computed between different locations $x_i$ and $x_j$ can reveal long-range correlations or areas influencing each other.
    $$ \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V $$
    where $Q, K, V$ are projections of the intermediate feature representation at different locations. Visualizing the attention maps $\text{softmax}(QK^T / \sqrt{d_k})$ can highlight influential regions.
*   **Cross-Attention:** To attribute importance to different parts of the input function $a(x)$, we can use cross-attention where the query $Q$ comes from the representation related to the output location $x_{out}$, and the keys $K$ and values $V$ come from the encoded representation of the input function $a(x_{in})$. The resulting attention weights highlight which parts of the input $a(x_{in})$ are most attended to when predicting the solution at $x_{out}$. This is particularly relevant when $a$ represents spatial boundary conditions or time-dependent forcing terms.
*   **Parametric Attention:** If the DE involves parameters $\nu$ (e.g., viscosity, reaction rates) which are inputs to the operator, attention can also be used to weigh the influence of different parameters on the solution features.

**Interpretation:** Visualizing attention maps overlaid on the input or output domains provides spatial or parametric attribution. High attention weights indicate regions or parameters deemed important by the model for its prediction at a given query point. This aligns with identifying critical spatiotemporal regions or influential parameters [Idea Motivation].

**3.4 Component 3: Counterfactual Explanations**
Counterfactual explanations address "what-if" questions, revealing causal links assumed by the model.

**Method:**
1.  Given a baseline input $a$ and its predicted solution $u = \mathcal{G}_{\theta}(a)$.
2.  Define a perturbation $\delta a$ to the input. This could be:
    *   A localized change in initial conditions (e.g., increasing temperature in a small region).
    *   A modification of boundary conditions (e.g., changing inflow velocity).
    *   A change in a physical parameter $\nu$ (e.g., decreasing viscosity).
3.  Compute the predicted solution $u' = \mathcal{G}_{\theta}(a + \delta a)$ for the perturbed input.
4.  Analyze the difference $\Delta u = u' - u$.

**Analysis:** Visualizing $\Delta u$ shows how the model predicts the solution will change in response to the specific input perturbation. This provides insights into the model's learned cause-and-effect relationships. For example, "If the initial heat pulse was 10% stronger here, how would the temperature field evolve differently after time T?". Sensitivity maps can be generated by computing $\| \Delta u \| / \| \delta a \|$ for small perturbations across the input domain.

**Interpretation:** Counterfactuals provide intuitive, example-based explanations of the model's behavior regarding specific input manipulations, directly addressing the causal aspect of understanding [Idea Motivation].

**3.5 Data Collection and Generation**
We will focus on well-studied PDE benchmarks commonly used in SciML literature:
1.  **1D Burgers' Equation:** A simple non-linear equation modeling shocks. Allows easy visualization and known analytical/semi-analytical solutions for certain cases. Input: initial condition $u_0(x)$.
2.  **2D Heat Equation:** A parabolic PDE modeling diffusion. Allows testing on different boundary conditions and initial states. Input: initial condition $u_0(x, y)$, potentially boundary conditions.
3.  **2D Navier-Stokes Equations (Lid-driven cavity or flow past a cylinder):** A challenging non-linear system modeling incompressible fluid flow. Represents a complex, industrially relevant problem. Input: boundary conditions, viscosity $\nu$.

Data will be generated using high-fidelity numerical solvers (e.g., Finite Difference/Volume methods with fine grids, spectral methods) implemented in standard libraries (e.g., FEniCS, Dedalus, MATLAB's PDE Toolbox). We will generate datasets covering a range of parameters (e.g., viscosity in Navier-Stokes, diffusion coefficient in Heat Eq.), initial conditions (drawn from Gaussian Random Fields with varying correlation lengths), and boundary conditions. Each dataset will contain $N \approx 1000-5000$ input-output pairs $(a_i, u_i^*)$. Data will be split into training, validation, and testing sets (e.g., 80%/10%/10%).

**3.6 Experimental Design and Validation**
We will conduct a comprehensive evaluation comparing the proposed INO framework against:
*   **Baseline Neural Operators:** FNO [Li et al., 2020], DeepONet [Lu et al., 2021].
*   **Other Interpretable Approaches (where applicable):** Potentially LNO [1] or symbolic regression methods [cf. 8].
*   **Traditional Numerical Solver:** Used for generating ground truth and as a performance reference (though speed comparison is expected to favor neural operators significantly at inference time).

**Evaluation Metrics:**
1.  **Predictive Accuracy:**
    *   Relative L2 error: $ \frac{\| u_{pred} - u_{true} \|_{L^2(\Omega)}}{\| u_{true} \|_{L^2(\Omega)}} $ computed over the test set.
    *   Mean Squared Error (MSE).
    *   Evaluation across different time points or parameter values.
2.  **Interpretability Quality:**
    *   **Symbolic Component:**
        *   Sparsity measure: Number of non-zero coefficients $c_k$.
        *   Complexity: Complexity of the symbolic expression (e.g., number of terms, degree of polynomials).
        *   Physical Consistency: For cases with known limiting behaviors or dominant terms, assess if $u_{sym}$ captures them correctly.
        *   Residual Ratio: $ \| u_{res} \| / \| u_{pred} \| $, indicating the proportion captured by the non-symbolic part.
    *   **Attention Maps:**
        *   Qualitative Evaluation: Visual inspection by researchers and domain experts to see if attention focuses on physically meaningful areas (e.g., sharp gradients, boundaries, sources).
        *   Quantitative (Potential): Correlation with gradient-based saliency maps, or measures of focus/entropy of attention distributions.
    *   **Counterfactual Explanations:**
        *   Plausibility: Do the predicted changes $\Delta u$ align with physical intuition or results from perturbing the traditional solver?
        *   Sensitivity Analysis: Compare model-derived sensitivities with analytical Ssensitivities (if available) or finite difference approximations using the traditional solver.
    *   **Domain Expert Evaluation (Qualitative):** Develop a survey or interview protocol. Present domain experts (e.g., physicists, engineers) with predictions and their corresponding explanations (symbolic form, attention maps, counterfactual examples) for specific test cases. Ask them to rate the explanations on:
        *   Clarity: Is the explanation easy to understand?
        *   Trustworthiness: Does the explanation increase confidence in the prediction?
        *   Usefulness: Does the explanation provide valuable scientific insight?
        *   Fidelity: Does the explanation seem consistent with underlying principles?
3.  **Computational Cost:**
    *   Training Time: Wall-clock time and number of epochs to convergence.
    *   Inference Time: Time taken to predict a single solution $u$ given a new input $a$.
    *   Model Size: Number of parameters.

**3.7 Uncertainty Quantification (Optional Extension)**
While the primary focus is interpretability, the framework can potentially be extended to include Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). This could be achieved by using Bayesian Neural Networks for the residual component $u_{res}$ or employing deep ensembles, allowing the model to provide confidence intervals alongside its predictions. This aspect can be explored if time permits, further enhancing the model's utility in scientific applications.

3.  **Comprehensive Benchmark Results:** Quantitative results comparing INO with baseline models (FNO, DeepONet) regarding accuracy, interpretability metrics, and computational cost across the selected PDEs. This will elucidate the trade-offs between interpretability and performance [Literature Review - Challenge 1].
