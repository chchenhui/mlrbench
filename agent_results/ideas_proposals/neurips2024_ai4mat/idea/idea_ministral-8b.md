### Title: "AI-Driven Materials Discovery via Hybrid Data Fusion and Incomplete Data Imputation"

### Motivation
The integration of AI in materials science is still in its early stages compared to other fields like drug discovery and computational biology. This discrepancy is largely due to the unique challenges posed by multimodal, incomplete data in materials science. By addressing these challenges, we can accelerate materials discovery and bring innovative materials closer to real-world applications.

### Main Idea
This research proposal focuses on developing a hybrid data fusion and incomplete data imputation framework to enhance AI-driven materials discovery. The methodology involves:
1. **Multimodal Data Fusion**: Leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to integrate data from various sources such as spectroscopy, microscopy, and computational simulations.
2. **Incomplete Data Imputation**: Employing generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and GANs, to impute missing data points based on available information and domain knowledge.
3. **AI-Guided Design**: Using the enriched dataset to train AI models for predictive materials design, optimizing properties such as strength, conductivity, and thermal stability.

Expected outcomes include:
- Enhanced accuracy and reliability in materials prediction and design.
- Reduction in the time and cost of materials discovery and development.
- Improved collaboration between AI researchers and materials scientists.

The potential impact is significant, as it could revolutionize the way materials are discovered and developed, leading to breakthroughs in various industries, from electronics to renewable energy.
