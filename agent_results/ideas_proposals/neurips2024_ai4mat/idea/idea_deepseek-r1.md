**Title:** Multi-Modal Physics-Informed Transformer for Handling Incomplete Materials Data  

**Motivation:** Current AI models in materials science struggle with incomplete, heterogeneous data from diverse experimental sources, limiting their real-world applicability. The lack of methods that seamlessly integrate sparse, multimodal data while respecting physical constraints hinders accelerated discovery.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a multi-modal transformer architecture that leverages cross-modal attention and physics-informed learning to address data incompleteness. The model will: (1) Use attention mechanisms to infer missing modalities by learning inter-modal relationships, (2) Incorporate physics-based constraints (e.g., symmetry rules, thermodynamic laws) via differentiable loss terms, and (3) Employ uncertainty quantification to flag low-confidence predictions. By training on fragmented datasets (e.g., partial characterization results paired with synthesis parameters), the framework will enable robust property prediction and inverse design. Expected outcomes include improved accuracy in scenarios with >50% missing modalities and actionable uncertainty estimates for guiding experiments. This approach bridges data scarcity and model reliability, accelerating the translation of AI insights into real materials innovation.
