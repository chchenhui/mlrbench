**Physics-Informed Multimodal Transformer for Accelerating Materials Discovery from Sparse and Heterogeneous Data**

## 2. Introduction

**2.1 Background**
The discovery and design of novel materials with tailored properties are fundamental drivers of technological progress across diverse fields, including renewable energy, electronics, catalysis, and medicine. Traditional materials discovery relies heavily on intuition-driven, Edisonian trial-and-error experimentation, complemented by computationally intensive simulations (e.g., Density Functional Theory - DFT). While powerful, these approaches are often slow, expensive, and struggle to navigate the vast combinatorial space of possible materials compositions and structures.

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as transformative paradigms to accelerate this process. By learning complex patterns and relationships hidden within large materials datasets, ML models can predict material properties, suggest promising candidate materials, and guide experimental synthesis and characterization efforts (Chen et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2023). However, the application of AI in materials science faces unique and significant challenges, hindering its potential for exponential growth compared to fields like natural language processing or computer vision, a key concern highlighted by the AI for Accelerated Materials Discovery (AI4Mat) Workshop.

One major hurdle is the nature of materials data itself. It is inherently **multimodal**, encompassing diverse forms such as symbolic chemical formulas, numerical synthesis parameters (temperature, pressure, time), 2D microscopy images (SEM, TEM), 1D diffraction patterns (XRD, Raman spectra), complex 3D crystal structures, and outputs from computational simulations. Furthermore, experimental and computational datasets are often **sparse** and **incomplete**. Experiments may only probe a limited set of properties, characterization data might be missing for certain samples, and underlying scientific understanding (e.g., precise phase stability rules, reaction kinetics) can be incomplete or unknown. Standard ML approaches often struggle to effectively integrate such heterogeneous, fragmented information and may produce physically implausible predictions when extrapolating from sparse data.

**2.2 Literature Context**
Existing research demonstrates the promise of AI in materials science. Generative models like MatAgent leverage LLMs and diffusion models for inverse design (Takahara et al., 2025), while integrated AI and HPC workflows enable large-scale screening (Chen et al., 2024). Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown success in learning from crystal structures (Gao et al., 2023). On the multimodal front, frameworks like Meta-Transformer aim to unify learning across diverse data types but typically assume large, albeit unpaired, datasets and lack specific mechanisms for incorporating domain-specific physical constraints (Zhang et al., 2023). While these approaches advance the field, they often do not explicitly address the synergistic challenges of multimodality, extreme sparsity, missing data, *and* the need for physical plausibility endemic to real-world materials discovery pipelines. There is a clear need for models that can reason effectively over fragmented, multimodal information while respecting the fundamental laws of physics and chemistry.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
This research aims to bridge this gap by developing a novel Physics-Informed Multimodal Transformer (PIMT) architecture specifically designed for sparse and heterogeneous materials data. The primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Multimodal Transformer Architecture:** Design and implement a Transformer-based model capable of ingesting and processing diverse materials data modalities (e.g., compositional information, synthesis parameters, structural data, spectral data, microscopy images). This includes developing adaptable modality-specific tokenization and embedding strategies.
2.  **Implement Robust Multimodal Fusion:** Engineer cross-attention mechanisms within the Transformer that can effectively fuse information from different modalities while gracefully handling missing or incomplete data streams for specific samples.
3.  **Integrate Physical Constraints:** Incorporate known physical laws, chemical principles, and domain knowledge (e.g., charge neutrality, phase diagram compatibility, thermodynamic stability rules, crystallographic constraints) directly into the model's learning process. This will be explored through physically-informed loss functions and/or attention mechanisms.
4.  **Validate Performance on Realistic Materials Tasks:** Evaluate the PIMT model on benchmark and realistic materials datasets, focusing on property prediction tasks under varying levels of data sparsity and modality completeness. Compare its performance against established baselines.
5.  **Enhance Interpretability and Reliability:** Assess the extent to which the physics constraints improve the model's generalization, predictive reliability (physical plausibility), and potentially offer interpretable insights into the relationships between different data modalities and material properties.

**2.4 Significance**
This research directly addresses the core themes of the AI4Mat Workshop. By tackling the "Unique Challenges" of multimodal, incomplete materials data, it aims to enhance the reliability and robustness of AI models in this domain. The integration of physical constraints is a key step towards making AI predictions more trustworthy and interpretable, potentially mitigating the "Why Isn't it Real Yet?" gap by producing more actionable and physically grounded hypotheses for experimental validation. Successfully developing PIMT would:

*   **Accelerate Materials Discovery:** Enable more efficient exploration of the materials space by leveraging fragmented existing data more effectively.
*   **Improve Predictive Accuracy and Reliability:** Lead to more accurate property predictions, especially in data-scarce regimes, by grounding the model in physical reality.
*   **Enhance Data Utilization:** Provide a framework to synergistically combine diverse experimental and computational data sources, maximizing the value derived from expensive data acquisition.
*   **Advance Multimodal ML:** Contribute novel techniques for incorporating domain constraints and handling missing data within multimodal Transformer architectures, with potential applicability beyond materials science.

## 3. Methodology

**3.1 Overall Framework**
We propose the Physics-Informed Multimodal Transformer (PIMT), illustrated conceptually below. The model accepts inputs from various modalities associated with a material sample. Each modality is first processed by a dedicated tokenizer and embedding module. The resulting token embeddings are then fed into a central Transformer encoder, which uses self-attention and cross-attention layers to learn intra-modal and inter-modal representations. Critically, physical constraints are integrated either into the attention mechanism or the learning objective. Finally, task-specific heads (e.g., regression head for property prediction, classification head for stability prediction) operate on the fused representation.

```
[Input Modalities] -> [Modality-Specific Tokenizers/Embedders] -> [Physics-Informed Transformer Encoder (Self/Cross-Attention)] -> [Fused Representation] -> [Task-Specific Heads] -> [Output (Prediction)]
     |-------------------------------------- Incorporating Physics Constraints ------------------------------------|       |-----> [Loss Calculation (Prediction + Physics)]
```

**3.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing**
We plan to utilize a combination of public materials databases and potentially synthetic datasets to train and evaluate PIMT.
*   **Potential Datasets:**
    *   **Materials Project (MP):** Rich source of computed properties (formation energy, band gap, elastic moduli) linked to crystal structures and compositions. Offers a large-scale baseline.
    *   **Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD):** Similar to MP, provides DFT-calculated thermodynamic properties.
    *   **Aflow:** Another large repository of computed materials properties.
    *   **Citrine Informatics / Experimental Repositories:** Publicly available experimental datasets often contain synthesis parameters, characterization data (XRD, SEM), and measured properties, though typically smaller and sparser than computational databases.
    *   **Simulated Datasets:** We may generate synthetic multimodal data (e.g., simulated XRD patterns from structures using pymatgen, representative microstructures) to supplement real data and control sparsity/modality presence during evaluation.
*   **Preprocessing:**
    *   **Composition:** Represented as strings (e.g., "Fe2O3") or fractional vectors based on elemental stoichiometry.
    *   **Crystal Structure:** Represented as Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) or graph representations (nodes=atoms, edges=bonds).
    *   **Synthesis Parameters:** Numerical values (temperature, pressure, time) will be normalized. Categorical parameters (e.g., synthesis method) will be one-hot encoded or embedded.
    *   **Spectra (XRD, Raman):** Resampled to a fixed grid, normalized intensity, potentially treated as sequences or embedded using 1D CNNs.
    *   **Images (SEM, TEM):** Resized to a standard dimension, normalized pixel values, possibly augmented.
    *   **Handling Sparsity:** Missing data will be explicitly handled, not imputed by default, using mechanisms described below.

**3.3 Modality-Specific Tokenization and Embedding**
Different data types require tailored processing to convert them into a sequence of token embeddings suitable for the Transformer:

*   **Composition/Text:** Utilize subword tokenization (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding or WordPiece) on chemical formulas or descriptions. Embeddings can be learned from scratch or initialized from pre-trained chemical language models.
*   **Scalar/Vector Parameters:** Treat each parameter or small groups of related parameters as individual "tokens." Apply a linear projection layer to map them to the Transformer's embedding dimension $d_{model}$.
*   **Crystal Structures:** Employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) pre-trained on structure-property tasks (e.g., MEGNet, SchNet) to generate a graph-level embedding, which is then treated as a single "structure token," or use node embeddings from the GNN as a sequence of tokens.
*   **Spectra (1D Sequences):** Apply a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) followed by pooling or flattening to obtain sequence embeddings, or directly segment the spectra and project segments to $d_{model}$.
*   **Microscopy Images (2D):** Adapt the Vision Transformer (ViT) approach: divide the image into patches, flatten each patch, and apply a linear projection to get patch embeddings. A special [CLS] token can represent the global image information.

Each modality $m$ produces a sequence of token embeddings $E_m = \{e_{m,1}, e_{m,2}, ..., e_{m,N_m}\}$, where $e_{m,i} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{model}}$ and $N_m$ is the number of tokens for modality $m$. Positional encodings will be added to token embeddings within each modality sequence.

**3.4 Multimodal Fusion with Cross-Attention and Missing Modality Handling**
The core of the PIMT is a Transformer encoder employing both self-attention (within modalities) and cross-attention (between modalities) to learn fused representations.

*   **Input Concatenation:** Token sequences from all available modalities for a sample are concatenated, potentially with special separator tokens: $E_{concat} = [E_1; E_2; ...; E_M]$.
*   **Self-Attention:** Standard self-attention layers within the Transformer process $E_{concat}$, allowing tokens to attend to all other tokens, enabling information flow both within and across modalities.
    $$ \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V $$
    where $Q, K, V$ are query, key, and value matrices derived from the input embeddings, and $d_k$ is the key dimension.
*   **Handling Missing Modalities:** If a modality $m$ is missing for a sample, its corresponding token sequence $E_m$ is simply omitted from $E_{concat}$. The self-attention mechanism inherently allows the model to operate on variable-length sequences. Alternatively, we can explore:
    *   **Learnable "Missing" Tokens:** Introduce modality-specific learnable embedding vectors that represent the absence of that modality.
    *   **Attention Masking:** Ensure that tokens from present modalities do not erroneously attend to non-existent tokens from missing modalities via appropriate attention masks.
    *   **Modality Embeddings:** Add a learned embedding vector to each token indicating its source modality, which might help the model reason about presence/absence.

**3.5 Physics-Constrained Learning**
This is the core novelty. We will explore two primary strategies:

1.  **Physics-Constrained Loss Function:** Augment the standard task-specific loss $L_{task}$ (e.g., Mean Squared Error for property regression) with a physics-constraint violation penalty term $L_{physics}$.
    $$ L_{total} = L_{task} + \sum_{i} \lambda_i L_{physics, i} $$
    where $\lambda_i$ are hyperparameters weighting the contribution of each constraint $i$. Examples of $L_{physics, i}$:
    *   **Charge Neutrality:** For a predicted composition or ionic assignments, penalize deviations from charge balance. If $o_j$ is the predicted oxidation state of atom $j$ and $n_j$ is its count in the formula unit, $L_{charge} = (\sum_j n_j o_j)^2$. This requires an auxiliary output head predicting oxidation states or relies on known chemical rules applied post-hoc to model outputs.
    *   **Thermodynamic Stability:** Penalize predictions inconsistent with known phase diagrams or convex hull stability. If the model predicts formation energy $E_f$, $L_{stability} = \max(0, E_f - E_{hull})$, where $E_{hull}$ is the energy relative to the convex hull of known stable phases (obtained from databases or estimated).
    *   **Symmetry Constraints:** For structure generation tasks, penalize generated structures that violate specified crystallographic symmetry group rules. This might involve comparing generated symmetry operations with target ones.
    *   **Conservation Laws:** Ensure predicted reaction pathways conserve mass and element types.

    Calculating $L_{physics}$ often requires differentiable implementations of these checks or using them as soft constraints guiding the learning process.

2.  **Physics-Informed Attention Mechanisms:** Modify the attention mechanism itself to favor physically plausible interactions.
    *   **Constraint-Weighted Attention:** Modulate the attention scores $A_{ij} = \frac{Q_i K_j^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}$ based on the physical compatibility $C(i, j)$ between tokens $i$ and $j$.
        $$ \text{AttentionScore}_{ij} = A_{ij} + \beta \cdot \log C(i, j) $$
        or $$ \text{AttentionScore}_{ij} = A_{ij} \cdot f(C(i, j)) $$
        where $C(i, j)$ could represent, e.g., compatibility based on elemental electronegativity difference, phase diagram information, or geometric constraints between structural components represented by tokens. $\beta$ is a learnable or fixed scalar, and $f$ is a suitable scaling function. This requires defining meaningful pairwise compatibility scores.

We will start with the loss-based approach due to its relative implementation simplicity and explore attention-based methods if promising. Hybrid approaches are also possible.

**3.6 Training Procedure**
The model will be trained end-to-end using backpropagation.
*   **Optimizer:** AdamW optimizer with decoupled weight decay.
*   **Learning Rate:** Cosine annealing schedule with warm-up.
*   **Loss Function:** As defined in Sec 3.5 ($L_{total}$).
*   **Regularization:** Dropout within the Transformer layers, weight decay.
*   **Batching:** Samples will be batched, potentially using padding and attention masks to handle variable sequence lengths arising from different numbers of tokens per modality and missing modalities.

**3.7 Experimental Design**
Validation will proceed through rigorous experiments:

*   **Datasets:** Utilize benchmark datasets (e.g., subset of Materials Project with diverse properties) and attempt to curate or simulate a more realistic sparse, multimodal dataset combining computational and experimental-like data (e.g., composition + structure + simulated XRD + predicted stability + sparse measured property). We will systematically introduce sparsity by randomly removing modalities or individual data points for samples.
*   **Tasks:** Focus on property prediction (e.g., formation energy, band gap, elastic moduli) and potentially material classification (e.g., stable/unstable, metal/insulator).
*   **Baselines:** Comparisons will include:
    *   Single-modality models (e.g., GNN on structure only, MLP on composition/parameters only).
    *   Simple multimodal fusion (e.g., concatenating embeddings + MLP).
    *   Standard Multimodal Transformer (e.g., adaptation of Perceiver IO or Meta-Transformer without physics constraints).
    *   Ablated version of PIMT without the physics-constraint term ($L_{physics}$ set to 0).
    *   State-of-the-art materials informatics models relevant to the specific task (e.g., MEGNet, CGCNN).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Prediction Accuracy:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for regression; Accuracy, F1-score, Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) for classification.
    *   **Robustness:** Evaluate performance degradation as a function of increasing data sparsity and percentage of missing modalities.
    *   **Physical Plausibility:** Quantify the physical validity of predictions where possible (e.g., percentage of predicted stable compounds that are indeed near the known convex hull, adherence to charge neutrality rules).
    *   **Calibration:** Assess the confidence scores associated with predictions.
*   **Ablation Studies:** Systematically evaluate the contribution of:
    *   Each modality (by removing them one by one).
    *   The physics constraints (comparing PIMT with and without $L_{physics}$).
    *   Different implementations of physics constraints (loss vs. attention).
    *   Cross-attention vs. simpler fusion mechanisms.
