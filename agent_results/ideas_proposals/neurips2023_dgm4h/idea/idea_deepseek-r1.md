**Title:** Clinically Validated Diffusion Models for Synthetic Rare Disease Data Generation  

**Motivation:** Rare diseases suffer from severe data scarcity, hindering AI model development and clinical research. Current generative models lack domain-specific validation, making synthetic data unreliable for medical use. This work addresses the critical need for trustworthy, interpretable synthetic data that preserves rare disease characteristics while complying with privacy constraints.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a diffusion-based framework that generates synthetic medical imaging data (e.g., MRI/CT scans) for rare diseases, integrating two innovations: 1) Conditioning on clinically interpretable biomarkers (e.g., lesion size, anatomical landmarks) during generation to ensure alignment with disease pathology, and 2) A hybrid validation protocol combining automated metrics (e.g., Fr√©chet Inception Distance adapted to medical features) and structured clinician feedback on diagnostic relevance. The model will use a latent diffusion architecture with learnable clinical embeddings, enabling controllable generation. Synthetic data will be evaluated via downstream classification tasks and expert panels assessing realism and utility. Expected outcomes include a validated pipeline for generating rare disease datasets, improving model generalizability and enabling equitable access to AI-driven diagnostics. Impact: Accelerate research in underrepresented conditions while addressing privacy and data access barriers.
