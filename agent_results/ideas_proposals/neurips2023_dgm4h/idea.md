# Multimodal Diffusion Models for Robust Healthcare Diagnostics

## Motivation
Medical diagnostics frequently depend on multiple data modalities (imaging, clinical notes, lab results), but most AI systems process these independently, missing crucial cross-modal correlations. Additionally, rare diseases and underrepresented patient populations often lack sufficient training data, leading to poor diagnostic performance for these critical cases. Current approaches struggle with noisy or missing modalities in real-world clinical settings, limiting their practical adoption.

## Main Idea
We propose developing multimodal diffusion models specifically designed for healthcare diagnostics that can jointly process diverse clinical data types while maintaining robustness to missing modalities. Our approach uses a hierarchical architecture where modality-specific encoders extract features from available inputs (e.g., MRI scans, EHR data, clinical notes), which are then integrated into a shared latent space. The diffusion process operates in this unified representation, allowing for conditional generation when certain modalities are missing. We incorporate medical domain knowledge through specialized attention mechanisms that prioritize clinically relevant patterns. Additionally, we design an adaptive training strategy that deliberately masks random modalities during training, forcing the model to learn robust cross-modal correlations. The system aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy for rare diseases while providing explainable predictions through feature attribution maps linked to specific modalities.
