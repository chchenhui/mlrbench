## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **Robust Multimodal Diffusion Models for Enhanced Healthcare Diagnostics under Data Scarcity and Missing Modalities**

**2. Introduction**

**Background:**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, offering unprecedented potential for improving diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient outcomes (Doe et al., 2023). Medical diagnosis often relies on synthesizing information from multiple sources, including medical imaging (MRI, CT, X-ray), electronic health records (EHR), clinical notes, laboratory results, and genomics data. However, most conventional AI systems process these modalities in isolation or use simplistic fusion techniques, often failing to capture the complex, non-linear correlations between them that are crucial for accurate diagnosis (Doe et al., 2023; Johnson et al., 2023). This limitation is particularly detrimental when dealing with complex or rare diseases where subtle cross-modal patterns might hold the key diagnostic information.

Furthermore, the development and deployment of AI in healthcare face significant hurdles. Medical datasets are notoriously difficult to acquire due to privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), high annotation costs, and the inherent rarity of certain conditions (Curie et al., 2025). This leads to data scarcity and imbalance, severely hindering the training of robust and generalizable models, especially for underrepresented patient populations and rare diseases (Key Challenge 1). Compounding this issue, real-world clinical data is often incomplete or noisy; patients may not undergo all possible tests, or certain data streams might be corrupted, leading to missing modalities (Key Challenge 3; Curie et al., 2025). Current models often exhibit brittle performance when faced with such missing data, limiting their clinical utility.

Deep generative models, particularly diffusion models, have emerged as a powerful paradigm, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity data, learning meaningful representations, and integrating diverse information sources (Workshop Overview; Zhan et al., 2024; Molino et al., 2025). Their application in healthcare holds immense promise for synthetic data augmentation (White et al., 2024), modality translation, super-resolution, and learning robust representations. Recent works like MedM2G (Zhan et al., 2024) and MedCoDi-M (Molino et al., 2025) showcase the potential of unifying multiple medical modalities within generative frameworks. Diffusion models have also been specifically tailored for medical image classification (Yang et al., 2023) and segmentation (Wu et al., 2022). However, critical challenges remain in designing generative models that are specifically robust to the data missingness common in clinical practice and in ensuring their outputs are interpretable for clinical trust (Key Challenge 4; Ford et al., 2024).

**Problem Statement:**
The primary challenges this research aims to address are:
1.  The suboptimal performance of diagnostic AI systems due to their inability to effectively integrate diverse clinical data modalities and capture crucial cross-modal correlations.
2.  The lack of robustness of existing multimodal models to missing or incomplete data, a common scenario in real-world clinical settings.
3.  The difficulty in developing accurate diagnostic models for rare diseases and underrepresented populations due to data scarcity and imbalance.
4.  The need for explainable AI in diagnostics to foster clinical adoption and trust.

**Proposed Solution:**
We propose the development of **Robust Multimodal Diffusion Models (RMDM)**, a novel generative framework specifically designed for healthcare diagnostics. RMDM leverages a hierarchical diffusion process operating on a shared latent space derived from multiple, potentially incomplete, clinical data modalities (e.g., imaging, text, tabular EHR data). The core innovations include:
1.  **Hierarchical Multimodal Integration:** Modality-specific encoders project diverse inputs into a unified latent space where the diffusion process occurs, enabling joint modeling and conditional generation.
2.  **Robustness by Design:** An adaptive training strategy incorporating deliberate modality masking forces the model to learn strong cross-modal dependencies, making it resilient to missing inputs during inference.
3.  **Domain Knowledge Integration:** Specialized attention mechanisms within the diffusion model prioritize clinically relevant features and inter-modal relationships.
4.  **Interpretability:** The model architecture facilitates explainability through modality-specific attribution maps derived from the diffusion process and attention weights.

**Research Objectives:**
1.  To design and implement a novel multimodal diffusion model architecture (RMDM) capable of integrating heterogeneous healthcare data (e.g., images, clinical notes, tabular data).
2.  To develop and incorporate an adaptive training strategy with modality masking to explicitly enhance the model's robustness to missing modalities.
3.  To integrate attention mechanisms guided by medical domain insights to improve feature representation and diagnostic relevance.
4.  To evaluate the diagnostic performance of RMDM, particularly for rare diseases or conditions with limited data, comparing it against state-of-the-art single-modality and multimodal baselines.
5.  To assess the robustness of RMDM under varying conditions of data missingness.
6.  To develop and evaluate methods for interpreting RMDM's predictions, providing modality-specific insights.

**Significance:**
This research directly addresses critical gaps identified in the workshop's call for papers and the broader literature (Key Challenges 2, 3, 4, 5). By developing a robust, interpretable multimodal generative model, this work aims to:
*   **Enhance Diagnostic Accuracy:** Improve diagnostic capabilities, especially for complex cases and rare diseases benefiting from multimodal insights.
*   **Increase Clinical Utility:** Provide a practical AI tool that can handle the realities of incomplete clinical data, moving beyond constrained research settings.
*   **Address Health Disparities:** Improve diagnostic performance for underrepresented groups and rare diseases often suffering from data scarcity, aligning with the workshop's focus on minority data groups.
*   **Advance Generative Modeling:** Contribute novel techniques for robust multimodal fusion and conditional generation within the diffusion model paradigm, specifically tailored for healthcare.
*   **Promote Trustworthy AI:** Offer interpretable outputs that can aid clinical decision-making and foster trust in AI-driven diagnostics.

**3. Methodology**

**Research Design:**
This research employs a quantitative, experimental design. We will develop the RMDM framework and validate its performance on benchmark multimodal healthcare datasets through rigorous experiments comparing it against relevant baseline methods across different scenarios of data availability.

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
We plan to utilize publicly available, de-identified multimodal healthcare datasets that include imaging, clinical notes, and structured EHR data. Potential datasets include:
1.  **MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR (Johnson et al., 2020):** Contains rich multimodal data (structured EHR, notes, chest X-rays) from ICU patients. Suitable for tasks like mortality prediction, disease diagnosis from X-rays+notes.
2.  **TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas):** Offers genomic, transcriptomic, clinical, and imaging data for various cancers. Applicable for cancer subtyping or outcome prediction.
3.  **CheXpert (Irvin et al., 2019) combined with associated Notes:** Chest X-ray images and radiology reports. Useful for evaluating image-text integration.

*Data Preprocessing:*
*   **Imaging Data:** Standard normalization (e.g., zero-mean, unit variance), resizing to uniform dimensions, potential data augmentation (rotations, flips).
*   **Textual Data (Clinical Notes/Reports):** Tokenization (e.g., usingSentencePiece or BERT tokenizers), lowercasing, removal of stop words (optional), embedding using pre-trained language models (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT).
*   **Tabular Data (EHR/Lab Results):** Handling missing values (mean/median imputation or model-based), normalization/scaling of continuous features, one-hot encoding of categorical features.

Ethical considerations regarding data privacy will be strictly adhered to by using publicly available, de-identified datasets.

**Model Architecture: Robust Multimodal Diffusion Model (RMDM)**
The RMDM framework consists of three main components: Modality-Specific Encoders, a Multimodal Fusion Module, and a Conditional Diffusion Model operating in a shared latent space.

1.  **Modality-Specific Encoders:** Each input modality $m \in M$ (where $M$ is the set of available modalities, e.g., {image, text, tabular}) is processed by a dedicated encoder $E_m$:
    *   Image Encoder ($E_{img}$): A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), e.g., ResNet, or Vision Transformer (ViT).
    *   Text Encoder ($E_{text}$): A Transformer-based model (e.g., BERT) or an RNN (e.g., LSTM).
    *   Tabular Encoder ($E_{tab}$): A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
    Each encoder $E_m$ maps its input data $x_m$ to a feature representation $z_m = E_m(x_m)$.

2.  **Multimodal Fusion Module:** The individual modality representations $\{z_m\}$ are fused into a unified representation $z_{shared}$ living in a shared latent space. We propose a hierarchical fusion mechanism potentially using cross-attention:
    $$ z_{shared} = Fusion(\{z_m\}_{m \in M_{present}}) $$
    where $M_{present}$ is the subset of modalities available for a given data point. The fusion module could involve concatenating features followed by an MLP, or more sophisticated techniques like cross-modal attention layers (e.g., inspired by Perceiver IO or Flamingo architectures) where representations attend to each other before being projected into the shared space. This module is crucial for capturing cross-modal correlations.

3.  **Conditional Diffusion Model:** We employ a diffusion probabilistic model conditioned on the fused representation $z_{shared}$. The diffusion process involves:
    *   **Forward Process (Noise Addition):** Gradually adds Gaussian noise to the target data (which could be a diagnostic label, a prognostic score, or even a target modality to be generated/imputed) over $T$ timesteps. Let $y_0$ be the target data. The forward process $q$ is defined as:
        $$ q(y_t | y_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(y_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} y_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I}) $$
        $$ q(y_{1:T} | y_0) = \prod_{t=1}^T q(y_t | y_{t-1}) $$
        where $\beta_t$ are variance schedule hyperparameters.
    *   **Reverse Process (Denoising/Generation):** Learns to reverse the noising process to generate the target $y_0$ starting from pure noise $y_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$, conditioned on the shared multimodal representation $z_{shared}$. The model learns a network $\epsilon_\theta$ (typically a U-Net architecture adapted for the target data type) to predict the noise added at each step $t$, conditioned on $y_t$ and $z_{shared}$:
        $$ p_\theta(y_{t-1} | y_t, z_{shared}) = \mathcal{N}(y_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(y_t, t, z_{shared}), \Sigma_\theta(y_t, t, z_{shared})) $$
        The model is trained to predict the noise $\epsilon$ added at step $t$ using a loss function, often simplified to:
        $$ L_{diffusion} = \mathbb{E}_{t, y_0, \epsilon, M_{present}} \left\| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} y_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon, t, Fusion(\{E_m(x_m)\}_{m \in M_{present}})) \right\|^2 $$
        where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$, $t$ is uniformly sampled from $\{1, \dots, T\}$, $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$, and $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{i=1}^t \alpha_i$.

4.  **Attention Mechanisms for Domain Knowledge:** Within the noise prediction network $\epsilon_\theta$ (e.g., in the U-Net blocks) and potentially in the fusion module, we will incorporate attention mechanisms (e.g., self-attention, cross-attention between $y_t$ and $z_{shared}$) designed to focus on clinically relevant patterns. For example, attention weights could be guided or regularized based on known clinical correlations if available, or simply learned end-to-end to prioritize informative features from relevant modalities based on the downstream task.

5.  **Handling Missing Modalities:** Robustness is achieved through:
    *   **Conditional Input:** The fusion module and the diffusion model are conditioned only on the *available* modalities $M_{present}$.
    *   **Adaptive Training Strategy:** During training, we randomly mask modalities for each sample with a certain probability $p_{mask}$. The model is forced to learn the reverse diffusion process even with partial multimodal context $z_{shared} = Fusion(\{E_m(x_m)\}_{m \in M_{masked}})$. This encourages the learning of redundant information and cross-modal imputation capabilities within the shared latent space.

**Adaptive Training Strategy:**
*   For each batch during training, iterate through samples.
*   For each sample, randomly select a subset of its modalities to mask (drop) based on a predefined probability $p_{mask}$ (e.g., $p_{mask}=0.25$). Ensure at least one modality remains.
*   Compute the shared representation $z_{shared}$ using only the non-masked modalities.
*   Compute the diffusion loss $L_{diffusion}$ using this partial $z_{shared}$.
*   Optionally, add an auxiliary loss $L_{aux}$ (e.g., a classification loss if the target $y_0$ is a diagnostic label, computed from an intermediate representation or the final prediction). The total loss becomes $L = L_{diffusion} + \lambda L_{aux}$.

**Experimental Design:**
1.  **Tasks:**
    *   Disease classification/diagnosis (e.g., detecting specific lung conditions from CheXpert+Notes, predicting sepsis from MIMIC-IV). Focus on tasks involving rare diseases where multimodal data might be particularly beneficial.
    *   Patient outcome prediction (e.g., ICU mortality prediction using MIMIC-IV).
    *   (Optional) Modality Imputation/Generation: Evaluate the model's ability to generate a missing modality conditioned on others.

2.  **Baselines:**
    *   **Single-Modality Models:** Train state-of-the-art models on each modality individually (e.g., CNN for images, BERT for text, MLP for tabular).
    *   **Early/Late Fusion:** Simple concatenation of features before/after modality-specific processing, followed by a classifier.
    *   **Attention-based Fusion:** Models like those proposed by Johnson et al. (2023).
    *   **Non-Robust Multimodal Diffusion:** Our RMDM trained *without* the adaptive modality masking strategy.
    *   **State-of-the-Art Multimodal Generative Models:** Adaptations of models like MedM2G (Zhan et al., 2024) or MedCoDi-M (Molino et al., 2025) if applicable to the diagnostic task and datasets.

3.  **Evaluation Scenarios:**
    *   **Complete Data:** Evaluate all models assuming all modalities are present during testing.
    *   **Simulated Missing Data:** Systematically remove one or more modalities during testing (e.g., remove imaging, remove text, remove tabular, remove pairs) and measure performance degradation. Compare RMDM against baselines.
    *   **Naturally Missing Data:** If datasets contain inherently missing modalities, evaluate performance on these subsets.

4.  **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Diagnostic Performance:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), Area Under the Precision-Recall curve (AUC-PR). Performance will be stratified by subgroups (e.g., rare vs. common diseases) where possible.
    *   **Robustness:** Measure the relative drop in performance metrics when modalities are missing compared to the complete data scenario. Lower degradation indicates higher robustness. Formally, Robustness Score = $1 - \frac{Perf_{complete} - Perf_{missing}}{Perf_{complete}}$.
    *   **Interpretability:**
        *   *Qualitative:* Visualize attention maps or generate feature attribution maps (e.g., using gradients or perturbations through the diffusion process) highlighting which features in which modalities contribute most to a prediction. Solicit feedback from clinical experts on the relevance of highlighted features.
        *   *Quantitative (Exploratory):* Metrics like faithfulness or sparsity of explanations, if applicable frameworks can be adapted (Ford et al., 2024).
    *   **(Optional) Generation Quality:** If evaluating imputation, use modality-specific metrics (e.g., PSNR/SSIM for images, BLEU/ROUGE for text, MAE/RMSE for tabular features).

**Implementation Details:**
*   Frameworks: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Diffusers library.
*   Compute: High-performance GPU clusters are required due to the computational demands of diffusion models and large datasets.
