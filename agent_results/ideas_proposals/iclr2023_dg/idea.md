**Title: Causal Structure-Aware Domain Generalization via Invariant Mechanism Learning**  

**Motivation:**  
Current domain generalization (DG) methods often fail because they rely on spurious correlations that vary across domains. A core challenge is identifying stable features that generalize under distribution shifts. Causal mechanisms, which dictate data-generating processes, are inherently invariant across domains, making them prime candidates for robust representation learning. This research aims to leverage causal structures to disentangle invariant mechanisms from domain-specific biases, addressing the fragility of existing DG approaches.  

**Main Idea:**  
Propose a framework that integrates causal discovery with representation learning to extract domain-invariant causal features. First, use domain-level metadata (e.g., environment labels) to infer a causal graph that distinguishes stable causal relationships from spurious associations via multi-domain data. Then, enforce invariance by aligning representations with the inferred causal structure through constraint-based optimization, penalizing dependencies on non-causal factors. For example, employ causal graph learning algorithms (e.g., conditional independence tests) and integrate them into a neural network via differentiable regularization. Validate on benchmarks like DomainBed, comparing against ERM and state-of-the-art DG methods. Expected outcomes include improved robustness to distribution shifts caused by spurious correlations. The impact lies in enabling reliable models for settings where domains are diverse or unobserved during training, such as medical imaging or autonomous driving.
