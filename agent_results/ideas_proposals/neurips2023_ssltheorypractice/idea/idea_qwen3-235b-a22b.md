1. Title:  
**"Understanding Sample Complexity in Self-Supervised Learning via Data Geometry"**

2. Motivation:  
The empirical success of self-supervised learning (SSL) is outpacing our theoretical understanding of its data requirements. While SSL reduces reliance on labeled data, practitioners lack guidelines for the *minimum unlabeled sample size* needed to learn effective representations. This gap is critical in domains with data acquisition costs (e.g., healthcare, robotics) or limited resources. Addressing this could optimize data collection, clarify SSLâ€™s scalability limits, and inform hybrid SSL-supervised workflows.

3. Main Idea:  
This work proposes a theoretical framework to analyze SSL sample complexity through the lens of **data geometry**, hypothesizing that the structure of unlabeled data (e.g., manifold regularity, invariance properties) determines the sample efficiency of auxiliary tasks. Using tools from learning theory and topological data analysis, we will:  
- **Characterize data geometries** that enable SSL to recover predictive representations with fewer samples.  
- **Derive bounds** linking task performance to unlabeled sample size, model capacity, and geometric priors (e.g., augmentation invariance in SimCLR).  
- **Empirically validate** these insights across modalities (vision, language) and architectures (e.g., MAE, BERT), measuring how accuracy degrades with smaller unlabeled sets.  

Expected outcomes include a metric to predict sample requirements for given data-modalities and tasks, guiding resource allocation. Theoretically, this could formalize why tasks like masked reconstruction excel in sparse data regimes. Practically, it would empower researchers to balance unlabeled data investment and model choice for specific applications.
