Title: Theory-Guided Curriculum Learning for Self-Supervised Representation Learning

Motivation:  
Current SSL methods rely on handcrafted or fixed auxiliary tasks, often requiring massive unlabeled data and trial-and-error tuning. A principled framework that schedules auxiliary tasks based on their theoretical sample complexity can improve data efficiency, convergence speed, and representation quality.

Main Idea:  
We propose to (1) derive lightweight proxies for the sample complexity of popular SSL tasks (e.g., contrastive, masked-reconstruction, clustering) by estimating task-specific mutual information gaps and spectral properties of their data transformations; (2) design a curriculum controller that orders and weights these tasks dynamically during training—starting from low-complexity tasks to bootstrap representations and progressively introducing harder tasks; (3) implement this scheduler atop standard SSL frameworks (SimCLR, MAE, BERT) and validate on vision and language benchmarks. We expect faster convergence (20–30% fewer epochs), higher downstream accuracy (+2–5%), and reduced unlabeled data requirements. This approach bridges SSL theory and practice by using theoretical insights to guide auxiliary task selection, yielding more efficient and robust self-supervised models.
