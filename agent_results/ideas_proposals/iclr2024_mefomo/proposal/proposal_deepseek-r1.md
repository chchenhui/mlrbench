**Probing Pre-training Data Influence on Emergent Abilities via Representation Perturbation**

### 2. Introduction  
**Background**  
Foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent capabilities—such as in-context learning and multi-step reasoning—that arise unpredictably during pre-training. While scaling laws suggest that model size and dataset diversity drive these abilities, the specific contributions of individual pre-training data subsets remain poorly understood. Recent work [1, 2] highlights that pre-training dynamics, particularly loss thresholds and data composition, may dictate emergent behaviors. For instance, Wei et al. [3] observed that abilities like chain-of-thought reasoning manifest abruptly in larger models, posing questions about the role of domain-specific data (e.g., code or mathematical corpora). Identifying critical data subsets could enable efficient training, targeted capability enhancement, and mitigation of harmful behaviors without full model retraining.

**Research Objectives**  
This study aims to:  
1. Map pre-training data clusters to specific regions of a model’s representation space.  
2. Quantify the causal influence of these clusters on downstream emergent abilities.  
3. Propose actionable insights for data curation to optimize FM training and alignment.  

**Significance**  
Understanding how data shapes emergent behaviors bridges the gap between empirical FM performance and theoretical understanding. By linking data subsets to specific capabilities, this work can reduce the computational cost of training, enable fine-grained control over model outputs, and advance safety measures. The methodology also offers a framework for diagnosing and correcting undesirable behaviors in deployed FMs.

### 3. Methodology  

#### 3.1 Data Collection & Clustering  
**Data Sources**  
- **Corpora**: Use publicly available pre-training datasets (e.g., C4, The Pile, CodeParrot) and metadata.  
- **Clustering**: Apply semantic clustering via:  
  - **Embedding-based Methods**: Sentence-BERT [4] or DinoV2 [5] to group text/code by domain (e.g., STEM, dialogue, legal).  
  - **Topic Modeling**: BERTopic [6] for unsupervised identification of dominant themes.  
  - **Metadata Filters**: Leverage dataset-provided labels (e.g., GitHub repositories tagged as "math").  

Clusters are validated using k-means silhouette scores and human annotation. Let $C = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_k\}$ denote the final clusters, where $c_i$ represents a data subset (e.g., mathematical proofs).

#### 3.2 Representation Space Analysis  
**Probing Critical Dimensions**  
For each cluster $c_i$, train *probing classifiers* to predict $c_i$ from hidden states $h \in \mathbb{R}^d$ of a frozen FM. Using logistic regression or MLPs, identify the subset of neurons $S_i \subseteq \{1, ..., d\}$ most predictive of $c_i$. Normalized weight magnitudes determine neuron importance:  

$$
w_{i,j} = \frac{|\beta_j|}{\sum_{k=1}^d |\beta_k|}, \quad \forall j \in \{1, ..., d\}
$$

where $\beta_j$ is the classifier coefficient for neuron $j$. Neurons with $w_{i,j} > \tau$ (a significance threshold) are deemed critical for encoding $c_i$.

**Causal Mediation Analysis**  
Adapt Zhang et al.’s [7] mediation framework to isolate the causal effect of $S_i$ on an emergent task $T$. For input $x$, let $h$ be the original representation and $h_{\text{pert}}$ its perturbed version. The average causal effect (ACE) is:  

$$
\text{ACE} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim T} \left[ f_T(h) - f_T(h_{\text{pert}}) \right]
$$

where $f_T$ measures performance on $T$ (e.g., accuracy). ACE quantifies $c_i$’s contribution to $T$.

#### 3.3 Representation Perturbation Techniques  
For each critical subset $S_i$, apply:  
1. **Ablation**: Zero-out neurons in $S_i$:  
   $$ h_{\text{pert}}[j] = \begin{cases} 0, & \text{if } j \in S_i \\ h[j], & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$  
2. **Projection**: Remove $c_i$-aligned components via orthogonal projection:  
   $$ h_{\text{pert}} = h - \sum_{v \in V_i} (h \cdot v) v $$  
   where $V_i$ spans the subspace for $c_i$.  
3. **Gradient-Based Perturbation**: Maximize loss for $c_i$’s classifier to degrade cluster-specific features:  
   $$ h_{\text{pert}} = h + \epsilon \cdot \text{sign}(\nabla_h \mathcal{L}(h, c_i)) $$  

Perturbation intensity $\epsilon$ is tuned to avoid catastrophic forgetting of unrelated tasks.

#### 3.4 Experimental Design  
**Models & Tasks**  
- **Models**: LLaMA-2 (7B–70B) and GPT-NeoX (20B).  
- **Emergent Tasks**:  
  - **Reasoning**: GSM8K (math), BIG-Bench (Dyck languages, logical deduction).  
  - **Safety**: Toxicity detection (RealToxicityPrompts), bias benchmarks (CrowS-Pairs).  

**Control Variables**  
- Baseline comparisons against unperturbed models.  
- Ablation studies varying cluster size, perturbation method, and model scale.  

**Validation Metrics**  
- **Task Performance**: Accuracy, F1 score, BLEURT for generation quality.  
- **Representational Similarity**: Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) between original and perturbed models.  
- **Causal Strength**: ACE (Eq. 2) for each cluster-task pair.  

#### 3.5 Statistical Analysis  
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Use Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare perturbed vs. original task performance.  
- **Regression Analysis**: Model ACE as a function of cluster size, semantic relevance, and model scale.

### 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Critical Data Identification**: Quantitative evidence linking clusters (e.g., code data) to specific abilities (e.g., reasoning).  
2. **Scaling Laws for Data Influence**: Metrics showing how ACE scales with cluster size and model parameters.  
3. **Perturbation Robustness**: Guidelines for maximum ablation thresholds that preserve general capabilities.  

**Impact**  
- **Efficient Training**: Data curation strategies to prioritize high-impact subsets, reducing compute costs by up to 30% (estimated).  
- **Model Safety**: Methods to suppress toxic behaviors by perturbing clusters linked to harmful content.  
- **Theoretical Advancements**: Causal frameworks for reverse-engineering emergent abilities, addressing challenges in [2, 3].  

**Potential Challenges & Mitigations**  
- **Confounding Clusters**: Overlapping data domains may blur causal links. Mitigation: Iterative clustering with purity checks.  
- **Over-Perturbation**: Excessive ablation could degrade general skills. Mitigation: Dynamic $\epsilon$ tuning via validation loss.

### 5. Conclusion  
This proposal outlines a systematic approach to dissecting the relationship between pre-training data and emergent abilities. By innovatively combining representation perturbation with causal analysis, the study aims to unlock actionable insights for responsible and efficient FM development. The resulting framework will empower researchers to engineer models with predictable capabilities, advancing both empirical and theoretical understanding of foundation models.
