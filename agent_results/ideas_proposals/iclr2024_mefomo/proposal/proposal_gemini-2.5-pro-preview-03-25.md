**1. Title:** Quantifying Pre-training Data Influence on Emergent Abilities in Foundation Models via Representation Perturbation Analysis

**2. Introduction**

*(Background)*
Foundation Models (FMs), such as large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3/4, LLaMA, and PaLM, and vision models like SimCLR and CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a vast array of tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023; Chowdhery et al., 2022). Trained on web-scale, diverse datasets, these models often exhibit "emergent abilities" â€“ capabilities, such as complex reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, or nuanced in-context learning, that are not explicitly present in smaller-scale models or directly optimized for during pre-training (Wei et al., 2022). These phenomena are scientifically intriguing and practically significant, but our understanding of their origins lags considerably behind their empirical success. Why certain capabilities emerge, and how they relate to the massive, heterogeneous pre-training datasets, remains largely an open question. The recent success of smaller models like LLaMA, achieving performance comparable to larger predecessors, suggests that data quality, composition, and training objectives play a critical role, potentially more so than sheer scale alone (Touvron et al., 2023). This underscores the need for deeper insights into the relationship between pre-training data characteristics and the resulting model capabilities. The Workshop on Mathematical and Empirical Understanding of Foundation Models specifically calls for research investigating pre-training data influence, emergent phenomena, and the mechanisms underlying FM behavior, making this research direction highly relevant.

*(Problem Statement)*
While it is widely believed that the diversity and composition of pre-training data are crucial drivers of emergent abilities, pinpointing the *specific* contribution of different data subsets (e.g., code, mathematical proofs, dialogue, narrative text) to particular skills (e.g., coding proficiency, logical deduction, few-shot learning) is extremely challenging. Current methods often rely on correlational studies (e.g., observing performance changes after adding certain data types) or require expensive and often impractical full model re-training experiments. Understanding these connections is vital for several reasons: (1) it could enable more efficient data curation strategies, optimizing pre-training corpora to foster desired capabilities or mitigate unwanted biases without needing ever-larger datasets; (2) it could provide insights into the internal mechanisms by which FMs develop complex skills, contributing to a more rigorous theoretical understanding; (3) it might allow for targeted interventions post-hoc to enhance or suppress specific abilities without full fine-tuning or retraining. Existing work highlights the role of pre-training loss thresholds (Du et al., 2024) and the general phenomenon of emergence (Wei et al., 2022), but lacks methodologies to causally link specific data *types* within the pre-training mix to specific emergent abilities through the lens of learned representations.

*(Research Objectives)*
This research aims to develop and validate a methodology for quantifying the influence of distinct pre-training data subsets on the emergent abilities of foundation models by analyzing and perturbing their internal representations. Our primary objectives are:

1.  **Identify and Characterize Representation Subspaces:** To identify and characterize directions or subspaces within the FM's activation space that are strongly associated with specific categories or clusters of pre-training data (e.g., code, mathematics, encyclopedic knowledge).
2.  **Develop Representation Perturbation Techniques:** To implement targeted perturbation techniques (e.g., ablation, steering) that selectively modify the model's internal representations along these identified data-associated directions.
3.  **Quantify Influence on Emergent Abilities:** To systematically measure the impact of these representation perturbations on the FM's performance across a suite of benchmark tasks designed to evaluate specific emergent abilities (e.g., mathematical reasoning, code generation, logical deduction).
4.  **Establish Data-Representation-Capability Links:** To establish empirical links between specific types of pre-training data, the representation subspaces they influence, and their contribution to downstream emergent capabilities.

*(Significance)*
This research promises significant contributions aligned with the goals of the workshop. By providing a methodology to dissect the contribution of pre-training data subsets, we move beyond correlational observations towards a more mechanistic understanding of how FMs acquire complex skills. This directly addresses the workshop's focus on "Understanding the data" within the Pre-Training topic and the characterization of "Scale-driven capabilities" within the Emergent Phenomena topic. Successfully quantifying data influence could lead to more principled and efficient data curation strategies for pre-training, potentially reducing the computational and data requirements for building capable FMs. Furthermore, understanding how data shapes representations related to specific skills can inform efforts in model alignment, safety, and the mitigation of biases potentially learned from certain data segments (relevant to the Adaptation: Safety and Alignment topic). Ultimately, this work aims to provide valuable empirical evidence and analytical tools to advance the mathematical and empirical understanding of foundation models.

**3. Methodology**

Our proposed methodology involves a multi-step process: selecting a foundation model and relevant datasets, identifying data clusters and associated representation directions, applying targeted representation perturbations, and evaluating the impact on emergent abilities.

*(3.1 Data Selection and Preparation)*

1.  **Foundation Model:** We will primarily use publicly available, pre-trained foundation models from families like LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023) or Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023). We plan to start with a mid-sized model (e.g., 7B parameters) for computational tractability, potentially extending the analysis to smaller/larger variants to study scaling effects. The choice of open models allows access to weights and facilitates reproducibility. The Pythia suite is particularly interesting as it provides checkpoints throughout training, potentially allowing analysis of how data influence evolves.
2.  **Pre-training Data Approximation:** Accessing the exact pre-training dataset is often difficult. We will use a representative open dataset like The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) or SlimPajama as a proxy or reference corpus. We will identify distinct subsets within this corpus based on available metadata (e.g., source domain like 'GitHub', 'PubMed Central', 'StackExchange', 'Wikipedia') and/or unsupervised clustering methods (e.g., topic modeling on document embeddings). Key clusters of interest include:
    *   Code (various languages)
    *   Mathematical Content (arXiv papers, math websites)
    *   Formal Logic / Proofs
    *   Encyclopedic / Factual Knowledge (Wikipedia)
    *   Dialogue / Conversational Data
    *   Narrative / Fictional Text
3.  **Downstream Evaluation Tasks:** We will select a suite of benchmarks focusing on well-established emergent abilities:
    *   **Mathematical Reasoning:** GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021).
    *   **Code Generation:** HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), MBPP (Austin et al., 2021).
    *   **Logical Reasoning:** Tasks from BIG-Bench Hard (Suzgun et al., 2022) such as logical deduction, causal judgment.
    *   **In-Context Learning:** Few-shot performance on diverse classification or QA tasks without explicit fine-tuning.
    *   **Common Sense / World Knowledge:** Tasks like HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020).

*(3.2 Identifying Data Cluster Representations)*

Let $M$ be the pre-trained foundation model. For a given input $x$ (e.g., a text sequence from the pre-training corpus), let $h_l(x) \in \mathbb{R}^d$ denote the activation vector (e.g., the output of the feed-forward network or the residual stream) at a specific layer $l$ and token position (or an aggregation like mean pooling over positions).

1.  **Representation Extraction:** We will process a large, diverse sample of documents ($X_c$) belonging to each identified pre-training data cluster $c$ (e.g., $c=$ 'Code', $c=$ 'Math'). For each document $x \in X_c$, we extract the activations $h_l(x)$ at one or more intermediate layers $l$ known to capture semantic information (e.g., middle-to-late layers in Transformers).
2.  **Cluster Direction Identification:** We aim to find a direction vector $v_{l,c}$ in the activation space of layer $l$ that captures the "essence" of data cluster $c$. Several methods can be employed:
    *   **Difference of Means:** A simple approach is to compute the difference between the mean activation vector for cluster $c$ and the mean activation vector for a contrasting set (e.g., all other data, or a specific contrasting cluster $c'$):
        $$v_{l,c} = \frac{1}{|X_c|} \sum_{x \in X_c} h_l(x) - \frac{1}{|X_{\neg c}|} \sum_{x' \in X_{\neg c}} h_l(x')$$
        where $X_{\neg c}$ is the set of examples not in cluster $c$.
    *   **Linear Probes:** Train a linear classifier (e.g., logistic regression) on $h_l(x)$ to predict whether an input $x$ belongs to cluster $c$. The weight vector of this classifier can serve as the direction $v_{l,c}$.
    *   **Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs):** Following Kim et al. (2018), train a linear classifier to distinguish between activations from cluster $c$ and a random/general background set. The vector orthogonal to the separating hyperplane defines the CAV $v_{l,c}$. This method explicitly aims for interpretability.

We will normalize these direction vectors, $v_{l,c} \leftarrow v_{l,c} / \|v_{l,c}\|_2$. The robustness of these directions will be tested by training on different data splits and potentially using different layers $l$.

*(3.3 Representation Perturbation)*

During inference on a downstream task $T$, let $x_T$ be an input to the task, and let $h_l(x_T)$ be the activation at layer $l$ generated during the forward pass. We will intervene in the forward pass to modify this activation based on the learned cluster directions $v_{l,c}$.

1.  **Perturbation Techniques:**
    *   **Ablation:** Remove the component of the activation along the cluster direction $v_{l,c}$.
        $$h'_l(x_T) = h_l(x_T) - \text{proj}_{v_{l,c}}(h_l(x_T)) = h_l(x_T) - (h_l(x_T) \cdot v_{l,c}) v_{l,c}$$
        This aims to simulate the effect of *lacking* the influence of data cluster $c$.
    *   **Steering/Addition:** Add or subtract the cluster direction $v_{l,c}$ with a controllable strength parameter $\alpha$.
        $$h'_l(x_T) = h_l(x_T) \pm \alpha v_{l,c}$$
        This allows investigating both enhancement ($\alpha > 0$) and suppression ($\alpha < 0$) effects. The magnitude of $\alpha$ will be tuned, potentially relative to the activation norm $\|h_l(x_T)\|$.
2.  **Intervention Point:** The modified activation $h'_l(x_T)$ replaces the original $h_l(x_T)$, and the forward pass continues from layer $l+1$ onwards using the perturbed representation. The choice of layer $l$ for intervention is crucial; we will experiment with different layers, hypothesizing that mid-to-late layers are most likely to encode semantic abstractions relevant to emergent skills.

*(3.4 Experimental Design and Evaluation)*

1.  **Baseline:** Establish the baseline performance of the unmodified FM ($M$) on each downstream evaluation task $\mathcal{T}$. Let $\text{Perf}(M, \mathcal{T})$ be the baseline score.
2.  **Perturbation Experiments:** For each identified pre-training data cluster $c$ and corresponding direction $v_{l,c}$:
    *   Apply the ablation perturbation at layer $l$. Run the perturbed model $M_{l,c}^{\text{ablate}}$ on task $\mathcal{T}$ and measure its performance $\text{Perf}(M_{l,c}^{\text{ablate}}, \mathcal{T})$.
    *   Apply the steering perturbation for a range of $\alpha$ values (both positive and negative). Run the perturbed models $M_{l,c,\alpha}^{\text{steer}}$ on task $\mathcal{T}$ and measure performance $\text{Perf}(M_{l,c,\alpha}^{\text{steer}}, \mathcal{T})$.
3.  **Control Conditions:**
    *   **Random Directions:** Generate random vectors $v_{\text{rand}}$ in the activation space $\mathbb{R}^d$ (with the same norm as cluster directions) and apply the same perturbation techniques. This control helps ascertain if performance changes are specific to the data cluster directions or simply due to arbitrary representation modification.
    *   **Orthogonal Directions:** Perturb along directions orthogonal to $v_{l,c}$ to check specificity.
    *   **Non-Targeted Clusters:** Perturb representations associated with data clusters expected *not* to influence a specific task (e.g., perturbing the 'Code' direction while evaluating on a common sense reasoning task).
4.  **Influence Quantification:** The influence of data cluster $c$, mediated through layer $l$, on task $\mathcal{T}$ can be quantified by the performance drop due to ablation or the sensitivity to steering:
    *   Ablation Impact: $\Delta_{\text{ablate}}(l, c, \mathcal{T}) = \text{Perf}(M, \mathcal{T}) - \text{Perf}(M_{l,c}^{\text{ablate}}, \mathcal{T})$
    *   Steering Sensitivity: Analyze the curve of $\text{Perf}(M_{l,c,\alpha}^{\text{steer}}, \mathcal{T})$ as a function of $\alpha$. The maximum change or the slope around $\alpha=0$ indicates sensitivity. A large positive $\Delta_{\text{ablate}}$ suggests cluster $c$ is crucial for task $\mathcal{T}$. Significant changes in performance under steering suggest that the representation direction $v_{l,c}$ causally influences the model's ability on $\mathcal{T}$.
5.  **Statistical Significance:** We will use appropriate statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests comparing performance distributions over benchmark instances) to assess the significance of observed performance changes compared to baseline and control conditions. We will repeat experiments with different random seeds for model inference and potentially direction finding.

*(3.5 Tackling Challenges)*

*   **Identifying Critical Data Subsets:** Our methodology directly tackles this by linking operationally defined clusters (via metadata or topic modeling) to representation directions.
*   **Representation Perturbation Techniques:** We propose concrete techniques (ablation, steering) inspired by representation engineering and causal abstraction literature. We will carefully tune parameters ($\alpha$, layer $l$) and compare different direction-finding methods (mean diff, probes, CAVs).
*   **Measuring Downstream Impact:** We rely on established benchmarks for emergent abilities and quantify impact via performance differences and sensitivity analysis.
*   **Causal Inference:** While full causal mediation analysis is complex, our interventionist approach (perturbing representations) moves beyond correlation. The comparison with random/orthogonal direction controls strengthens the causal interpretation of specific direction perturbations. We acknowledge this is an approximation of true causal effects related to training data inclusion.
*   **Data Curation Insights:** The quantified influence scores ($\Delta_{\text{ablate}}$, steering sensitivity) directly inform which data types appear most impactful for specific skills, providing empirical grounding for future data curation experiments.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

*(Expected Outcomes)*

1.  **Validated Methodology:** We expect to establish a validated methodology for probing the influence of pre-training data subsets on FM capabilities via representation perturbation. This includes identifying effective layers for intervention and robust methods for finding data-cluster-specific directions.
2.  **Quantified Data Influence Map:** We anticipate generating a quantitative map linking specific pre-training data clusters (e.g., Code, Math, Wikipedia) to specific emergent abilities (e.g., GSM8K, HumanEval, Logical Deduction). For instance, we might find that ablating the 'Math' direction significantly degrades GSM8K performance while leaving code generation relatively unaffected, whereas ablating the 'Code' direction strongly impacts HumanEval.
3.  **Identification of Critical Representation Subspaces:** The research will identify specific directions or subspaces within FM representations (at chosen layers) that are critical for certain high-level capabilities. We expect these directions to be distinct for different skills.
4.  **Insights into Skill Composition:** By perturbing multiple directions simultaneously or analyzing the effect of perturbing a single direction across multiple tasks, we may gain insights into whether skills are highly localized to specific data influences or emerge from complex interactions between representations shaped by diverse data.
5.  **Empirical Basis for Data Curation:** The results will provide empirical evidence suggesting which data types are most valuable (or potentially detrimental) for cultivating specific desired emergent skills in FMs.

*(Impact)*

This research will directly contribute to the central theme of the workshop: achieving a deeper mathematical and empirical understanding of foundation models.

*   **Advancing FM Science:** By moving beyond correlational studies and providing a method for targeted intervention within the model's internal workings, this work offers a novel lens to study the relationship between training data, learned representations, and emergent behavior. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on understanding pre-training, representation learning, and emergent phenomena.
*   **Informing Efficient Training Practices:** If we can confirm that specific, identifiable data subsets disproportionately contribute to valuable emergent abilities, this knowledge can guide the development of more efficient pre-training strategies. Data curation could focus on amplifying high-impact data or synthetically generating data that strongly activates beneficial representational directions, potentially achieving desired capabilities with smaller datasets or less compute (addressing the "Understanding the data" sub-topic).
*   **Towards Controllable AI:** Understanding how data influences capabilities via representations is a step towards more controllable AI. The steering techniques explored could potentially be refined for post-hoc enhancement of desired skills or mitigation of undesired behaviors (e.g., reducing biases associated with certain data clusters) without full retraining or fine-tuning, connecting to the workshop's interest in Safety and Alignment.
*   **Addressing Key Challenges:** Our proposed work directly tackles several acknowledged challenges in FM research, including identifying critical data subsets, developing targeted manipulation techniques for representations, and measuring their downstream impact, offering concrete methods and expected empirical results.
*   **Stimulating Future Research:** We anticipate that our methodology and findings will stimulate further research into representation engineering for understanding FMs, causal analysis of neural networks, and principled data selection for large-scale model training.

In conclusion, this research proposes a rigorous empirical investigation into a fundamental question about foundation models: how does the data they learn from shape the remarkable abilities they exhibit? By leveraging representation perturbation, we aim to provide quantitative answers and contribute valuable insights to the rapidly evolving field of FM understanding, directly addressing the core interests of the workshop.
