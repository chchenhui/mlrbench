Title: Gradient-Diverse Curriculum Pre-training for Foundation Models

Motivation:  
Foundation model performance hinges not just on scale but on data quality and learning dynamics. Random data sampling dilutes signal and delays the emergence of higher-level capabilities (e.g., reasoning or in-context learning). A curriculum that prioritizes gradient‐diverse examples can accelerate representation learning and foster emergent behaviors under a fixed compute budget.

Main Idea:  
We propose an online “gradient‐diverse curriculum” where, during pre-training, batches are sampled to maximize pairwise gradient dissimilarity, encouraging the model to learn orthogonal features rapidly.  
Methodology:  
1. Proxy gradient estimation: periodically compute per-example gradients on a small held-out proxy model.  
2. Diversity scoring: cluster these gradient vectors (e.g., via k-means) or compute cosine‐diversity scores.  
3. Curriculum scheduler: increase sampling probability for under-represented gradient clusters to maintain maximal coverage of learning signals.  
4. Empirical evaluation: pre-train a transformer (e.g., 200M–1B parameters) under this curriculum vs. uniform sampling on standard corpora, then benchmark on language, reasoning, and in-context tasks.  
Expected Outcomes & Impact:  
• Faster convergence and stronger representations across downstream tasks  
• Earlier emergence of chain-of-thought and few-shot capabilities  
• Reduced compute and data requirements, illuminating the role of data ordering in foundation model emergence and generalization.
