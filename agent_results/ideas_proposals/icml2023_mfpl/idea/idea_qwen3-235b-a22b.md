1. **Title**: Fairness-Aware Preference Learning via Causal Inference and Generative Modeling  

2. **Motivation**: Current preference-based learning systems prioritize accuracy but often ignore biases embedded in human feedback, such as demographic or cultural prejudices. This risks amplifying unfairness in applications like hiring, healthcare, or recommendation systems. Addressing fairness in preference learning is critical to ensure equitable outcomes, especially when sensitive attributes (e.g., race or gender) are implicit (not provided as metadata) or obscured in feedback data.  

3. **Main Idea**: Propose a framework that combines causal inference and generative modeling to mitigate algorithmic bias in preference-based learning. First, use causal discovery to identify latent pathways connecting preferences to proxy variables for sensitive attributes (e.g., geolocation or education history). Then, integrate adversarial generative models to synthesize diverse preference trajectories that counteract identified biases, while preserving ranking consistency via a differentiable fairness constraint. Finally, train a reinforcement learning agent on the debiased preference data, leveraging contrastive learning to align the reward model with fairness-adjusted human objectives. Evaluate the system using real-world datasets (e.g., job-match or medical treatment preferences) and benchmark against fairness metrics (disparate impact, equalized odds) and utility trade-offs. This approach could set a precedent for equitable AI systems in high-stakes domains where human feedback drives decision-making.
