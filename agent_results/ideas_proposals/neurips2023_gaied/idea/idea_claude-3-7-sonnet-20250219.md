# Adaptive Dialogue-Based Learning with LLMs: Bridging Socratic Methods and AI

## Motivation
Traditional educational software often delivers knowledge through static pathways, failing to adapt to students' unique learning styles and comprehension gaps. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to implement dynamic Socratic teaching methods at scale. However, current implementations often lack the pedagogical sophistication needed for effective learning outcomes. This research aims to develop a framework that combines established educational theory with LLM capabilities to create truly adaptive dialogue-based learning experiences that enhance critical thinking while addressing concerns about over-reliance on AI.

## Main Idea
We propose developing an LLM-powered educational system that employs a multi-layered dialogue strategy inspired by Socratic teaching methods. The system will dynamically shift between five dialogue modes: questioning, scaffolding, challenging, reflecting, and synthesizingâ€”based on real-time assessment of student understanding. Unlike current AI tutors, our system will deliberately introduce productive struggle, withhold direct answers when pedagogically beneficial, and employ strategic silence to encourage independent thinking. We'll implement a transparent "pedagogy layer" that explains the educational strategy behind each interaction, helping students understand not just content but learning processes. The methodology includes developing specialized fine-tuning datasets from expert teacher-student dialogues, creating evaluation metrics that measure learning quality beyond factual accuracy, and building in safeguards that prevent the system from completing assignments or replacing critical thinking activities.
