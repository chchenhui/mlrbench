**Title:** Cognitively-Guided Neural Estimation of High-Dimensional Information Dynamics  

**Motivation:** Accurate estimation of information-theoretic quantities (e.g., mutual information, entropy) in high-dimensional cognitive systems (e.g., neural recordings, multi-agent AI) remains a major challenge. Existing methods struggle with scalability, bias, or fail to capture temporal dynamics, limiting insights into real-world cognitive processes. Addressing this gap is critical for advancing theories of human and artificial cognition.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a hybrid neural-variational framework that integrates cognitive priors (e.g., attention sparsity, hierarchical processing) to estimate time-varying information dynamics. The method will combine adaptive neural networks with structured variational bounds, regularized by constraints derived from cognitive principles (e.g., resource efficiency in decision-making). Validation will involve benchmark tasks (e.g., video-audio sensory integration datasets, RL agents with explainable policies) and comparisons to neuroscience/behavioral data. Expected outcomes include a robust open-source toolkit for estimating information flow in high-dimensional systems, with demonstrated applications in improving interpretability of artificial agents and modeling human perceptual decision-making. This bridges ML scalability with cognitive plausibility, fostering cross-domain collaboration.
