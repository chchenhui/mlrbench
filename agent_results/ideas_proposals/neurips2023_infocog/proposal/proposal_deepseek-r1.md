## 1. Title  
**Adaptive Information Bottleneck-Driven Communication Policies for Human-AI Collaboration: Balancing Expressiveness and Cognitive Load**  

---

## 2. Introduction  
### Background  
Human-AI collaboration is critical in domains such as healthcare, robotics, and education, where AI agents must communicate effectively with humans to achieve shared goals. However, existing systems often suffer from two extremes: *information overload*, where agents overwhelm users with excessive details, or *over-compression*, leading to misunderstandings. The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle—a foundational concept in information theory—provides a mathematical framework to optimize the trade-off between retaining task-relevant information and minimizing communication complexity. By formalizing communication as a compression problem, IB offers a principled way to align AI outputs with human cognitive limits.  

### Research Objectives  
This project aims to:  
1. Develop a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates variational IB principles to train AI agents in generating concise, task-aligned communication signals.  
2. Design adaptive communication policies that dynamically adjust compression levels based on real-time human feedback and task context.  
3. Validate the framework through human-in-the-loop experiments across diverse cooperative tasks, measuring both task performance and user experience.  
4. Establish metrics for evaluating communication efficiency, cognitive load, and alignment with human interpretability.  

### Significance  
This work bridges gaps between information theory, machine learning, and cognitive science by:  
- Providing a theoretically grounded method to optimize human-AI communication.  
- Advancing the understanding of how information compression impacts collaborative task performance.  
- Enabling the development of AI systems that respect human cognitive constraints, fostering trust and usability.

## 3. Methodology  
### Problem Formulation  
Let the agent’s internal state $X$ (e.g., environment observations, task plans) be the source variable. The communication signal $S$ is a compressed representation of $X$, optimized to retain information about a relevance variable $R$ (e.g., human partner’s goals, critical obstacles). The IB objective is:  
$$
\max_{p(S|X)} \left[ I(S; R) - \beta I(S; X) \right],
$$  
where $I(\cdot;\cdot)$ denotes mutual information, and $\beta$ controls the trade-off between expressiveness and compression.  

### Algorithmic Framework  
1. **Variational IB Architecture**:  
   - **Encoder**: A neural network $q_\theta(S|X)$ compresses $X$ into a stochastic signal $S$.  
   - **Predictor**: A network $q_\phi(R|S)$ reconstructs task-relevant aspects $R$ from $S$.  
   - **Compression Regularizer**: A variational approximation of $I(S; X)$ using a prior $p(S)$, implemented as a KL divergence:  
     $$
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{IB}} = \mathbb{E}_{X} \left[ \mathbb{E}_{S \sim q_\theta(S|X)} [-\log q_\phi(R|S)] + \beta \cdot \text{KL}(q_\theta(S|X) \| p(S)) \right].
     $$  

2. **Reinforcement Learning Integration**:  
   - The agent interacts with an environment and a human partner, receiving a reward $r_t$ based on task success and human feedback.  
   - The policy $\pi_\psi(a|S)$ maps signals $S$ to actions $a$, trained via proximal policy optimization (PPO) with an augmented reward:  
     $$
     r_{\text{total}} = r_{\text{task}} + \lambda \cdot r_{\text{comm}},
     $$  
     where $r_{\text{comm}} = I(S; R) - \beta I(S; X)$ encourages IB-optimal communication.  

3. **Adaptive Compression**:  
   - A meta-learner adjusts $\beta$ dynamically using human physiological signals (e.g., eye-tracking, response latency) to modulate cognitive load.  

### Experimental Design  
**Tasks**:  
- **Cooperative Navigation**: Agents guide humans through a virtual maze, communicating obstacle locations and optimal paths.  
- **Human-Robot Assembly**: Robots assist users in assembling objects, providing step-by-step instructions.  

**Data Collection**:  
- **Simulated Environments**: Use Unity-based simulations with synthetic humans following predefined response models.  
- **Human Studies**: Recruit 50 participants to interact with the AI agent across tasks, recording task completion time, error rates, and subjective feedback.  

**Baselines**:  
1. Standard RL without IB (e.g., A3C).  
2. Fixed-compression IB (static $\beta$).  
3. Language bottleneck methods (PLLB [Srivastava et al., 2024]).  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
- **Task Performance**: Success rate, completion time.  
- **Communication Efficiency**: Signal entropy, mutual information $I(S; R)$.  
- **Human Factors**: NASA-TLX cognitive load scores, self-reported trust (Likert scale).  
- **Interpretability**: BLEU score for language signals, human accuracy in reconstructing $R$ from $S$.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
### Expected Outcomes  
1. **Theoretical Contributions**:  
   - A unified framework for IB-driven communication policies in RL, extending prior work (e.g., VQ-VIB [Tucker et al., 2022]).  
   - Analysis of how adaptive $\beta$ tuning improves collaboration under dynamic human states.  

2. **Empirical Results**:  
   - IB-based agents will achieve **15–20% higher task success rates** compared to baselines in human studies.  
   - Communication signals will exhibit **30% lower entropy** while retaining >90% of task-relevant information.  
   - Participants will report **25% lower cognitive load** and higher trust in IB-driven agents.  

### Broader Impact  
- **AI Transparency**: By compressing signals to human-interpretable levels, the framework addresses the "black box" problem in AI decision-making.  
- **Cross-Disciplinary Synergy**: Findings will inform cognitive science models of human communication, offering quantifiable metrics for information efficiency.  
- **Applications**: Deployable in assistive robotics, collaborative manufacturing, and educational AI, where communication clarity is critical.

## 5. Conclusion  
This proposal advances the integration of information-theoretic principles into human-AI collaboration systems. By rigorously combining variational IB with adaptive RL, we aim to create agents that communicate as *effective partners* rather than mere tools. The outcomes will establish a benchmark for future research at the intersection of machine learning and cognitive science, paving the way for AI systems that are both competent and cognitively aligned.
