**Title:** Adversarial Prompt Crafting via Meta-Perturbations for Few-Shot Robustness  

**Motivation:**  
Large foundation models excel at few-shot learning but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, especially in domains like NLP and vision where perturbations in input or prompts can drastically alter outputs. Current adversarial training methods rely on large datasets, making them unsuitable for few-shot settings. Addressing this gap is critical to deploying safe, robust systems where minimal labeled data yet high reliability are required, such as healthcare or legal AI.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose *Meta-Adversarial Prompt Perturbation* (Meta-APP), a framework to train few-shot models to resist adversarial attacks by synthesizing task-agnostic adversarial prompts during pretraining. Our method meta-learns universal perturbations that degrade model performance across diverse prompts and input distributions. These perturbations are then used to adversarially train the foundation model, prioritizing invariance to prompt variations and input noise. Specifically, we: (1) train a lightweight generator of adversarial prompts via gradient-based meta-learning, (2) apply these prompts to unlabeled data to create diverse adversarial examples, and (3) refine the base model via a robust loss that aligns predictions across clean and adversarial samples. Expected outcomes include a 15â€“20% improvement in accuracy under attacks (e.g., typos, paraphrasing) compared to standard few-shot tuning. By explicitly modeling adversarial prompt distributions, Meta-APP bridges the robustness gap in low-data regimes, enabling safer deployment of foundation models in critical applications.
