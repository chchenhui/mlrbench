## 1. Title: Meta-Perturbation Adversarial Prompt Tuning (Meta-APT): Enhancing Few-Shot Robustness of Foundation Models via Task-Agnostic Adversarial Meta-Learning

## 2. Introduction

**Background:**
Large Foundation Models (LFMs), such as GPT-3/4, T5, CLIP, and ViT variants, represent a significant paradigm shift in machine learning, demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios (Brown et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2021; Raffel et al., 2020). Techniques like prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021), instruction tuning (Wei et al., 2021), and in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020) allow these models to adapt to new tasks with minimal labeled examples, drastically reducing the need for large-scale task-specific datasets. This progress moves us closer to versatile AI systems capable of learning efficiently, akin to human learning.

However, despite their impressive performance, LFMs exhibit significant vulnerabilities. A growing body of research highlights their susceptibility to adversarial examples – subtly modified inputs designed to cause misclassification or erroneous behavior (Szegedy et al., 2013). In the context of few-shot learning, this vulnerability extends beyond input perturbations to the prompts or instructions themselves (Zhou et al., 2024; Nookala et al., 2023). Malicious or even unintentional variations in prompts (e.g., typos, paraphrasing, slight semantic shifts) can lead to drastic drops in performance, raising serious concerns about their reliability and safety, especially in high-stakes applications like healthcare, finance, and legal domains.

Traditional adversarial training (AT) methods (Madry et al., 2018), which augment training data with adversarial examples, have shown promise in improving model robustness but typically require large amounts of labeled data and significant computational resources. This makes them ill-suited for the few-shot setting, where data scarcity is the defining characteristic. Recent works have started exploring adversarial robustness specifically for few-shot learning (Zhou et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2021), often employing meta-learning or focusing on perturbing support sets or prompts during task-specific adaptation. However, many existing methods generate task-specific adversarial examples or require adaptation for each new few-shot task, potentially limiting generalization and increasing computational overhead during deployment. There remains a critical need for methods that can instill inherent robustness into LFMs *before* they encounter specific few-shot tasks, particularly against prompt variations.

**Research Idea & Objectives:**
This research proposes **Meta-Perturbation Adversarial Prompt Tuning (Meta-APT)**, a novel framework designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of LFMs in few-shot learning scenarios by proactively training them to be resilient against challenging prompt variations. The core idea is to leverage meta-learning during a pre-finetuning or intermediate training stage to learn *task-agnostic* adversarial prompt perturbations. These learned perturbations represent "universal vulnerabilities" in how the model interprets prompts across a distribution of potential tasks.

The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop the Meta-APT Framework:** Design and implement a meta-learning procedure to train a lightweight generator model capable of producing effective, task-agnostic adversarial perturbations for prompts.
2.  **Integrate Meta-APT with Foundation Model Training:** Devise a robust training strategy that utilizes the generated adversarial prompts (applied to unlabeled data) alongside clean data to refine the foundation model, encouraging invariance to prompt perturbations without catastrophic forgetting of its core capabilities.
3.  **Evaluate Robustness Comprehensively:** Empirically assess the effectiveness of Meta-APT in improving few-shot robustness across diverse NLP and Vision-Language tasks against various natural and adversarial prompt perturbations (e.g., typos, paraphrasing, semantic noise, targeted attacks).
4.  **Analyze Robustness-Accuracy Trade-offs:** Investigate the impact of Meta-APT on the model's performance on clean data and standard few-shot benchmarks, quantifying any potential trade-offs between robustness gains and standard accuracy.
5.  **Compare with State-of-the-Art:** Benchmark Meta-APT against standard few-shot learning techniques (e.g., prompt tuning, in-context learning) and relevant existing few-shot adversarial robustness methods.

**Significance:**
This research directly addresses critical challenges outlined in the R0-FoMo workshop description concerning the robustness of few-shot learning in LFMs. By focusing on adversarial prompt variations – a key vulnerability in prompt-based learning – Meta-APT aims to bridge the robustness gap inherent in low-data regimes. Successfully developing Meta-APT would:

*   **Enhance Reliability:** Provide a mechanism to build more dependable LFMs for few-shot applications, particularly crucial for safety-critical domains where unexpected failures due to prompt sensitivity are unacceptable.
*   **Advance Robust AI:** Contribute novel techniques at the intersection of meta-learning, adversarial robustness, and few-shot learning for foundation models, potentially inspiring new directions in building inherently robust AI systems.
*   **Address Responsible AI Concerns:** Proactively mitigate potential harms arising from model brittleness by making LFMs less susceptible to manipulation or failure caused by prompt variations, aligning with the goals of building safe and trustworthy AI.
*   **Improve Understanding:** Shed light on the relationship between prompt design, few-shot sample size, and adversarial robustness in LFMs, informing best practices for deploying these powerful models.

This work tackles key questions posed by the workshop, including novel methods for few-shot robustness, the pitfalls of existing mitigation approaches (by proposing an alternative to data-heavy AT), and leveraging unlabeled data to improve transfer.

## 3. Methodology

This section details the proposed Meta-APT framework, the data requirements, the algorithmic steps, the experimental design for validation, and the evaluation metrics.

**A. Overall Framework:**
Meta-APT operates in three main phases, typically performed after standard pretraining but before task-specific few-shot fine-tuning or deployment:

1.  **Meta-Learning the Perturbation Generator:** Train a small, efficient generator network using meta-learning to discover universal adversarial prompt perturbations.
2.  **Generating Adversarial Prompt-Data Pairs:** Use the trained generator to perturb prompts for a large corpus of unlabeled data, creating diverse {adversarial prompt, data instance} pairs.
3.  **Robust Foundation Model Refinement:** Fine-tune the LFM using a combination of clean data and the generated adversarial prompt-data pairs, employing a robust training objective.

**B. Data Collection and Preparation:**

1.  **Foundation Model:** We will select pre-trained LFMs relevant to the target modalities, such as T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) or BART (Lewis et al., 2019) for NLP, and CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) or ViT variants (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) possibly combined with language models for vision-language tasks. Access to model weights and architectures is required.
2.  **Unlabeled Data Corpus:** A large, diverse unlabeled dataset will be used for generating adversarial examples in Phase 2 and for the robust refinement in Phase 3. Examples include C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) for text or LAION (Schuhmann et al., 2021) for image-text pairs.
3.  **Meta-Training Task Distribution:** For Phase 1, we need a distribution of simulated few-shot tasks. This can be constructed by sampling different task instructions (prompts) and pairing them with small subsets of data from diverse pre-existing datasets (e.g., subsets of GLUE, SuperGLUE for NLP; subsets of ImageNet, COCO captions for Vision/VL). The goal is diversity in tasks and prompts.
4.  **Few-Shot Evaluation Benchmarks:** Standard few-shot learning benchmarks will be used for final evaluation. Examples for NLP include RAFT (Alex et al., 2021) or subsets of SuperGLUE. For vision, benchmarks like Fewshot-CIFAR100, miniImageNet, or tieredImageNet are common. We will also use cross-domain benchmarks like DomainNet (Peng et al., 2019) adapted for few-shot evaluation.
5.  **Robustness Evaluation Benchmarks:** We will use established benchmarks and toolkits for evaluating robustness against prompt perturbations. For NLP: TextFlint (Wang et al., 2021), TextAttack (Morris et al., 2020), manually crafted paraphrases, typos, and semantic variations. For Vision/VL: ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019), ImageNet-P (Hendrycks et al., 2021) applied to inputs, and perturbed captions/prompts for VL models.

**C. Algorithmic Steps: Meta-APT**

Let $\mathcal{M}_{\theta}$ be the foundation model parameterized by $\theta$. Let $p$ be a task prompt (e.g., "Classify the sentiment of this text:") and $x$ be an input instance. In few-shot learning, the model typically predicts $y = \mathcal{M}_{\theta}(p, x)$ or uses $(p, x)$ within a specific adaptation procedure (like prompt tuning or in-context learning).

**Phase 1: Meta-Learning the Perturbation Generator ($G_{\phi}$)**
We aim to learn a generator $G_{\phi}$, parameterized by $\phi$, that produces a perturbation vector $\delta$ for a given prompt $p$. The perturbation $\delta$ should be applied to the prompt's representation (e.g., embedding) to create an adversarial prompt $p_{adv} = ApplyPerturbation(p, \delta)$.

*   **Generator Architecture:** $G_{\phi}$ can be a simple network, e.g., a small Transformer or LSTM, taking prompt $p$ (or its embedding) as input and outputting $\delta$. We constrain $||\delta||_p \le \epsilon$ for some norm $p$ (e.g., $L_{\infty}$) and small $\epsilon$.
*   **Meta-Learning Objective:** We adopt a gradient-based meta-learning approach like MAML (Finn et al., 2017). We sample meta-training batches, each containing several simulated few-shot tasks $T_i$. Each task $T_i$ consists of a prompt $p_i$, a small support set $S_i = \{(x_j, y_j)\}$, and potentially a query set $Q_i$.
    *   **Inner Loop:** For a given task $T_i$ and current generator $G_\phi$, find the perturbation $\delta_i$ that maximizes the model's loss on the support set (or a held-out validation set within the task). This involves finding $\delta_i = G_{\phi}(p_i)$ and potentially fine-tuning $\delta_i$ for a few steps using gradients from $\mathcal{M}_{\theta}$ to maximize the task loss (e.g., cross-entropy $L_{task}$):
        $$\delta_i^* = \arg\max_{\delta: ||\delta||_p \le \epsilon, \delta \approx G_{\phi}(p_i)} L_{task}(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}(ApplyPerturbation(p_i, \delta), S_i))$$
        Alternatively, we can directly optimize $G_{\phi}$ to output harmful perturbations without the inner gradient steps, focusing on the quick generation of effective $\delta$.
    *   **Outer Loop:** Update the generator parameters $\phi$ based on the effectiveness of the generated perturbations across the batch of tasks. The objective is to learn a $\phi$ that produces perturbations maximizing the loss *averaged over tasks*.
        $$\min_{\phi} \sum_{T_i \sim \mathcal{T}} L_{task}(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}(ApplyPerturbation(p_i, G_{\phi}(p_i)), Q_i))$$
        Or, if maximizing loss in inner loop:
        $$\min_{\phi} \sum_{T_i \sim \mathcal{T}} L_{meta}(\delta_i^*)$$
        where $L_{meta}$ could be related to the task loss achieved by $\delta_i^*$, guiding $\phi$ to produce perturbations that are highly effective across tasks. The LFM parameters $\theta$ are typically *frozen* during this phase or updated very slowly.

**Phase 2: Generating Adversarial Prompt-Data Pairs**
Once $G_{\phi}$ is trained, we apply it to a diverse set of prompts $\{p_k\}$ (potentially synthesized or sampled from various sources) and pair the resulting adversarial prompts $p_{adv, k} = ApplyPerturbation(p_k, G_{\phi}(p_k))$ with instances $x_m$ from the large unlabeled corpus $D_{unlabeled}$. This creates a large dataset $D_{adv} = \{(p_{adv, k}, x_m)\}$. The goal is to generate diverse and challenging examples without needing labels.

**Phase 3: Robust Foundation Model Refinement**
We refine the base LFM $\mathcal{M}_{\theta}$ (or employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning like LoRA (Hu et al., 2021)) using a robust objective function that leverages both clean prompts/data and the adversarial pairs from $D_{adv}$. Let $(p, x)$ be a clean prompt-data pair (potentially from $D_{unlabeled}$ or a labeled pre-finetuning dataset) and $(p_{adv}, x)$ be a corresponding adversarial pair.

*   **Robust Loss Function:** We propose a loss combining standard prediction loss on clean data with a consistency regularization term between clean and adversarial prompt outputs:
    $$L_{total} = \mathbb{E}_{(p, x) \sim D_{clean}} [L_{pred}(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}(p, x))] + \lambda \mathbb{E}_{(p_{adv}, x) \sim D_{adv}} [L_{consistency}(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}(p, x), \mathcal{M}_{\theta}(p_{adv}, x))]$$
    *   $L_{pred}$ could be a standard cross-entropy loss if labels are available, or a self-supervised objective (e.g., masked language modeling) if using only unlabeled data.
    *   $L_{consistency}$ penalizes divergence between the model's output/representation for the clean prompt $p$ and the adversarial prompt $p_{adv}$ given the *same* input $x$. Examples include Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between output distributions or cosine distance between hidden representations.
        $$L_{KL} = KL(P_{\theta}(y|p, x) || P_{\theta}(y|p_{adv}, x))$$
    *   $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter balancing standard performance and robustness.

This refinement step aims to make $\mathcal{M}_{\theta}$ inherently more invariant to the types of prompt perturbations generated by $G_{\phi}$.

**D. Experimental Design:**

1.  **Baseline Models:**
    *   Standard Pre-trained LFM (e.g., T5-Base, CLIP-ViT-B/32) with zero-shot prompting.
    *   Standard Few-Shot Fine-tuning: Prompt Tuning (Lester et al., 2021), In-Context Learning (ICL) with $k$ examples.
    *   Vanilla Adversarial Training (if feasible on few-shot task data): Generate adversarial examples for the specific few-shot task's support set and train.
    *   Relevant Prior Art: Implementations of methods like Few-Shot Adversarial Prompt Learning (Zhou et al., 2024) or methods adapting AT via meta-learning (Liu et al., 2021), if applicable as direct baselines.

2.  **Few-Shot Tasks:**
    *   **NLP:** Sentiment Analysis (e.g., SST-2), Natural Language Inference (e.g., RTE, MNLI), Question Answering (e.g., SQuAD), Text Classification from RAFT benchmark. Evaluate with varying shots ($k=1, 4, 8, 16$).
    *   **Vision/VL:** Image Classification (e.g., Fewshot-CIFAR100, miniImageNet), Image Captioning robustness, Visual Question Answering (VQA) robustness. Use standard few-shot splits ($k=1, 5$).

3.  **Robustness Evaluation:**
    *   **Attack Scenarios:** Evaluate performance under various prompt perturbations:
        *   *Naturalistic:* Typos, paraphrasing (using back-translation or paraphrase generation models), adding irrelevant context.
        *   *Adversarial:* Gradient-based attacks on prompt embeddings (if applicable), targeted semantic manipulations, potentially using the learned generator $G_{\phi}$ itself to evaluate worst-case performance. Use TextAttack/TextFlint transformations. For vision, evaluate robustness to input corruptions (ImageNet-C/P) and perturbed text prompts (e.g., minimal character/word changes).
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   *Clean Accuracy:* Standard accuracy/F1 score on original benchmark test sets.
        *   *Robust Accuracy:* Accuracy/F1 score on perturbed test sets under different attack types and intensities.
        *   *Relative Robustness Drop:* Percentage decrease in performance from clean to perturbed data.
        *   *AUC Robustness:* Area under the curve for accuracy vs. perturbation intensity.
        *   *Calibration:* Expected Calibration Error (ECE) under clean and perturbed conditions.

4.  **Ablation Studies:**
    *   Impact of $G_{\phi}$ complexity and meta-learning strategy.
    *   Effect of the $\lambda$ parameter in the robust loss function.
    *   Contribution of the consistency loss term.
    *   Sensitivity to the amount and diversity of unlabeled data ($D_{unlabeled}$) used.
    *   Performance comparison when Meta-APT is applied to the full model vs. parameter-efficient modules (e.g., LoRA + Meta-APT).
    *   Analysis of whether $G_{\phi}$ learns truly universal perturbations or biases towards the meta-training task distribution.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact

**Expected Outcomes:**

1.  **Development of Meta-APT:** A functional framework and codebase for Meta-APT, including the meta-learned perturbation generator and the robust refinement procedure applicable to standard LFMs.
2.  **Improved Few-Shot Robustness:** We hypothesize that models trained with Meta-APT will demonstrate significantly improved robustness against a wide range of prompt perturbations compared to baseline few-shot methods. We anticipate a 10-20% absolute improvement in accuracy under moderate adversarial prompt attacks (e.g., paraphrasing, semantic noise, targeted modifications) on standard few-shot benchmarks, particularly in NLP tasks.
3.  **Quantified Trade-offs:** A clear analysis of the trade-off between the achieved robustness and performance on clean data. We expect a potential minor decrease in clean accuracy (e.g., 1-3%) as a trade-off for significant robustness gains, which we aim to minimize through careful tuning of the robust loss ($\lambda$) and training procedure.
4.  **Benchmarking Results:** Comprehensive benchmark results comparing Meta-APT against standard few-shot learning and existing robustness techniques across multiple NLP and Vision/VL tasks and datasets.
5.  **Insights into Robustness Mechanisms:** Analysis from ablation studies providing insights into the key components driving the robustness improvements and the nature of the learned "universal" prompt perturbations.
6.  **Publications and Dissemination:** We aim to publish the findings at top-tier machine learning conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) or relevant workshops like R0-FoMo. The code and potentially pre-trained robust model variants will be released to the community.

**Impact:**

*   **Practical:** Meta-APT could provide practitioners with a valuable tool to enhance the reliability of LFMs deployed in few-shot scenarios, reducing risks associated with prompt sensitivity in real-world applications. This is particularly impactful for domains requiring high reliability with limited task-specific data.
*   **Scientific:** This research will contribute to the understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities in prompt-based learning and offer a novel meta-learning approach for proactive robustness enhancement. It bridges concepts from adversarial ML, meta-learning, and few-shot learning within the context of powerful foundation models.
*   **Responsible AI:** By directly tackling a key failure mode of LFMs in low-data settings, this work contributes towards building more robust, safe, and trustworthy AI systems. Improving robustness against prompt manipulation can help prevent misuse and unintended harmful outputs (e.g., biased or toxic content generated due to subtle prompt variations).
*   **Future Research:** The concept of meta-learning universal adversarial perturbations could be extended to other aspects of LFMs (e.g., input perturbations conditioned on prompts) or applied to different learning paradigms like continual learning. The learned generator $G_{\phi}$ itself could become a tool for evaluating model robustness.

By focusing on task-agnostic robustness learned *before* specific few-shot adaptation, Meta-APT offers a potentially more scalable and generalizable approach to improving the trustworthiness of foundation models in the increasingly prevalent few-shot learning paradigm, directly addressing the core themes of the R0-FoMo workshop.
