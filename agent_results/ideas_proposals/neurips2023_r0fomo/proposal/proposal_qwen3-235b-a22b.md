# Adversarial Prompt Crafting via Meta-Perturbations for Few-Shot Robustness  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Large foundation models (e.g., GPT, CLIP, DALL-E) have revolutionized few-shot and zero-shot learning, enabling rapid adaptation to novel tasks through prompt tuning, in-context learning, and instruction finetuning. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks—minor perturbations in inputs or prompts can drastically degrade performance. For instance, in natural language processing (NLP), paraphrasing prompts or introducing typos can mislead models, while in vision-language tasks, subtle stylistic changes disrupt cross-modal alignment. Traditional adversarial training methods, which rely on large labeled datasets to learn robust features, are incompatible with few-shot settings where labeled data is scarce. This gap impedes the deployment of foundation models in safety-critical domains like healthcare, legal systems, or autonomous vehicles, where minimal labeled data and high reliability coexist.  

### Research Objectives  
This research addresses two key challenges:  
1. **How can we enhance adversarial robustness in few-shot learning without access to large-scale labeled data?**  
2. **How can we design universal adversarial perturbations that degrade model performance across diverse prompts and tasks, enabling robustness gains during pretraining?**  

To tackle these questions, we propose *Meta-Adversarial Prompt Perturbation* (Meta-APP), a novel framework that meta-learns universal adversarial prompts to improve robustness in few-shot settings. Our methodology synthesizes adversarial examples by perturbing prompts (not inputs) and trains models to resist these attacks through adversarial invariance.  

### Significance  
By addressing the robustness-accuracy trade-off in few-shot learning, this work advances the deployment of foundation models in high-stakes applications. It provides:  
- A scalable adversarial training paradigm for low-data regimes.  
- Automated tools for evaluating robustness under diverse attacks (e.g., typos, paraphrasing).  
- Insights into prompt-based adversarial vulnerabilities in multimodal systems.  
This aligns with the workshop’s goals of fostering responsible AI through robustness benchmarks, automated evaluation, and human-in-the-loop systems.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Overview  
Meta-APP trains a lightweight adversarial prompt generator (APG) to synthesize task-agnostic perturbations during pretraining. These perturbations are applied to both labeled and unlabeled data to create adversarial examples, which are then used to refine the foundation model. The process consists of three stages:  
1. **Meta-Learning Adversarial Prompts**: Train APG to generate perturbations that degrade model predictions across diverse tasks.  
2. **Robustness-Aware Training**: Update the foundation model to resist adversarial prompts using a hybrid loss of clean and adversarial examples.  
3. **Evaluation**: Validate improvements in accuracy under attacks, generalization to unseen domains, and trade-offs with clean data performance.  

### 2.2 Algorithmic Details  

#### 2.2.1 Adversarial Prompt Generator (APG)  
The APG is a shallow neural network that learns additive perturbations $\delta$ to input prompts $\mathcal{P}$:  
$$
\mathcal{P}_{\text{adv}} = \mathcal{P} + \delta,
$$  
where $\delta$ is constrained by a Frobenius norm bound $\|\delta\|_F \leq \epsilon$. The APG is trained to maximize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between predictions on clean and adversarial prompts:  
$$
\max_{\delta} \, \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ D_{\text{KL}}\left(p_{\theta}(y|x, \mathcal{P}) \, \| \, p_{\theta}(y|x, \mathcal{P}_{\text{adv}})\right)\right].
$$  
This objective forces the foundation model $p_{\theta}$ to produce stable predictions despite perturbed prompts.  

#### 2.2.2 Meta-Learning Universal Perturbations  
To ensure task-agnostic robustness, APG is meta-learned over diverse pretraining tasks $\mathcal{T} = \{T_1, T_2, ..., T_k\}$. For each task $T_i$, we compute:  
1. **First-order gradient ascent** on $\delta$ to maximize loss:  
$$
\delta_i^* = \delta + \alpha \cdot \nabla_{\delta} \mathcal{L}_{T_i}(p_{\theta}, \mathcal{P}_{\text{adv}}),
$$  
2. **Meta-update** to generalize perturbations across tasks:  
$$
\min_{\theta} \sum_{T_i \sim \mathcal{T}} \mathcal{L}_{T_i}(p_{\theta}, \mathcal{P}_{\delta_i^*}).
$$  
This two-step process ensures that perturbations generalize beyond specific tasks, focusing on vulnerabilities common to many applications.  

#### 2.2.3 Robust Foundation Model Training  
The foundation model is updated to align predictions on clean and adversarial prompts via a robust loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{robust}} = \beta \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{clean}} + (1-\beta) \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}},
$$  
where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{clean}}$ is cross-entropy on clean examples, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}}$ is the KL divergence term from above, and $\beta \in [0,1]$ balances clean and adversarial accuracy.
