Title  
Meta-Adversarial Prompt Perturbation (Meta-APP) for Robust Few-Shot Learning in Foundation Models  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Large foundational models such as GPT-3, T0, and CLIP have demonstrated remarkable few-shot and zero-shot capabilities by leveraging in-context learning and prompt-tuning. Nevertheless, these models remain vulnerable to small perturbations in prompts or inputs. In critical domains (healthcare, legal, security), where only a handful of labeled examples are available, adversarial attacks—typos, paraphrases, or style shifts—can dramatically degrade performance and lead to unsafe or biased outcomes. Traditional adversarial training methods require large labeled datasets and full-fine-tuning, making them unsuitable for few-shot settings.  

Research Objectives  
Our goal is to develop a methodology that endows foundation models with robustness to adversarial prompt and input perturbations under severe data scarcity. Specifically, we aim to:  
1. Meta-learn a generator of universal adversarial prompt perturbations that generalize across tasks and input distributions.  
2. Leverage unlabeled data to synthesize diverse adversarial examples without requiring additional annotation.  
3. Integrate a robust training objective that balances accuracy on clean data with invariance to adversarial prompts.  
4. Evaluate the approach on both NLP (e.g., text classification, question answering) and vision-language tasks (e.g., zero-shot image classification with CLIP).  

Significance  
Meta-Adversarial Prompt Perturbation (Meta-APP) addresses a critical gap: enhancing robustness in low-data regimes. By explicitly modeling adversarial prompt distributions via meta-learning, our framework will enable safer deployment of foundation models in high-stakes scenarios. It will also open new directions for adversarial semi-supervised learning at scale.  

2. Related Work (brief integration)  
Adversarial prompt learning has attracted recent interest (e.g., Zhou et al. 2024; White & Brown 2023; Nookala et al. 2023). Meta-learning based adversarial approaches such as StyleAdv (Fu et al. 2023) and LCAT (Liu et al. 2021) have demonstrated cross-domain robustness in vision. However, none have meta-learned prompt perturbations for few-shot backbone models. Semi-supervised adversarial methods (Green & Black 2023) hint at the power of unlabeled data. We build upon these insights to craft a general, task-agnostic adversarial prompt generator suitable for both language and vision modalities.  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Overview  
Meta-APP consists of three components: (i) a meta-prompt perturbation generator $G_\phi$, (ii) adversarial example synthesis on unlabeled data $\mathcal{D}_u$, (iii) robust fine-tuning of the foundation model $f_\theta$. We alternately optimize $G_\phi$ to produce perturbations that maximize loss and $f_\theta$ to minimize a robust objective over both clean and adversarially perturbed inputs.  

3.2 Data and Task Setup  
We assume access to:  
• A pretrained foundation model $f_\theta$ (e.g., GPT-3, CLIP) with fixed parameters $\theta_0$.  
• A small support set $\mathcal{S}=\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^k$ for each task, where $k\le10$.  
• A large pool of unlabeled examples $\mathcal{D}_u = \{u_j\}_{j=1}^N$ drawn from the target distribution.  

We consider tasks in two modalities:  
• NLP classification tasks (SST-2, AGNews, QNLI)  
• Vision-language zero-shot classification with CLIP on ImageNet subsets  

3.3 Meta-Prompt Perturbation Generator  
We define a lightweight generator $G_\phi$ parameterized by $\phi$, which maps a clean prompt template $p$ and optionally an input embedding $h = h(x)$ to a perturbation $\delta = G_\phi(p,h)$. For text, $\delta$ may be a sequence of token‐level embeddings; for vision-language, $\delta$ may be a learnable prompt vector in the CLIP embedding space.  

Meta-objective  
Let $\mathcal{L}(f_\theta(x+p),y)$ be the task loss (e.g., cross-entropy). We seek a universal perturbation $\delta$ that maximizes average loss across tasks and inputs:  
$$
\max_\phi \ \mathbb{E}_{\text{task} \sim \mathcal{T}} \ \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim \mathcal{S}_{\text{task}}} \Big[\mathcal{L}\big(f_{\theta}(x + p + G_\phi(p,h(x))),\,y\big)\Big].
$$  
Practically, we approximate this via first-order MAML:  

Algorithm 1: Meta-learning $G_\phi$  
Input: support sets $\{\mathcal{S}_{\text{task}}\}$, prompt templates $p$, initial $\phi_0$, $\theta$ fixed.  
for iteration $t=1\dots T$ do  
  Sample batch of tasks $\{\mathcal{S}\}$  
  For each task:  
    Compute embeddings $h(x)$ for $(x,y)\in\mathcal{S}$  
    Generate perturbations $\delta = G_\phi(p,h(x))$  
    Compute loss $\ell_{\text{adv}} = \mathcal{L}(f_\theta(x+p+\delta),y)$  
  Aggregate $\ell_{\text{adv}} = \tfrac1{|\mathcal{S}|}\sum \ell_{\text{adv}}$  
  $\phi \gets \phi + \alpha_\phi \nabla_\phi \ell_{\text{adv}}$  
end for  

3.4 Adversarial Example Synthesis  
Using $G_{\phi^*}$ (after meta-training), we apply perturbations to unlabeled data $\mathcal{D}_u$. For each $u_j\in\mathcal{D}_u$, generate $\delta_j = G_{\phi^*}(p,h(u_j))$ and form adversarial unlabeled pair $(u_j+p+\delta_j,u_j)$. These examples enrich the training distribution with realistic, task-agnostic attacks.  

3.5 Robust Fine-Tuning of $f_\theta$  
We fine-tune $\theta$ on both clean support examples and adversarial unlabeled examples under a semi-supervised robust loss:  
$$
\min_\theta \ \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\in \mathcal{S}}\big[\mathcal{L}(f_\theta(x+p),y)\big]}_{\text{supervised}} \;+\;\lambda\;
\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{u\in \mathcal{D}_u}\big[\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(f_\theta(u+p)\,\|\,f_\theta(u+p+G_{\phi^*}(p,h(u))))\big]}_{\text{consistency on adversarial pairs}}.
$$  
Here $\lambda$ balances accuracy and robustness. We use KL divergence as a consistency loss to align model outputs on clean versus perturbed inputs.

• Balanced Performance: Maintain $A_{\mathrm{clean}}$ within 2% of the non-robust baseline, demonstrating minimal trade-off between robustness and accuracy.  
• Generality: Show that Meta-APP outperforms specialized adversarial prompt-tuning methods across multiple task domains.  
• Ablations: Demonstrate the effect of varying $\lambda$, size of $\mathcal{D}_u$, and prompt lengths on robustness.  

Broader Impact  
Safety and Responsible AI  
Meta-APP equips large foundational models with resilience to adversarial and distributional shifts in low-data settings, reducing risks of misinformation, bias amplification, or security breaches in safety-critical applications (e.g., clinical decision support, legal advice).  

Scalability  
By leveraging unlabeled data, our framework scales to numerous tasks without incurring labeling costs. The meta-perturbation generator is task-agnostic and can be applied to new tasks in a plug-and-play manner.

• Incorporating human-in-the-loop evaluation to refine adversarial coverage.  
• Combining Meta-APP with continual learning to defend against evolving adversarial strategies.  

Conclusion
