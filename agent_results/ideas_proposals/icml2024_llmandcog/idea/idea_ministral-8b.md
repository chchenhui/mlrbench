### Title: "Emergent Reasoning in LLMs: A Comparative Study of End-to-End and Augmented Models"

### Motivation
The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to exhibit emergent reasoning capabilities has been a subject of great interest. However, the comparative performance of end-to-end fine-tuned models versus augmented models (coupled with external modules) in cognitive tasks remains underexplored. This research aims to bridge this gap by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, providing insights into the fundamental limits of LLMs in reasoning tasks and their potential for improvement.

### Main Idea
The proposed research will conduct a comparative study of end-to-end fine-tuned LLMs and augmented models on various cognitive tasks, including reasoning, navigation, and planning. The methodology involves training and evaluating both types of models on a set of standardized cognitive benchmarks and custom datasets. We will employ a multi-faceted evaluation approach, including quantitative metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) and qualitative analysis (e.g., case studies, human evaluations) to rigorously assess their performance.

Expected outcomes include:
- Identification of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in different cognitive tasks.
- Insights into the fundamental limits of LLMs in reasoning and other cognitive abilities.
- Development of recommendations for improving existing benchmarks and evaluation methods to better assess cognitive capabilities in LLMs.

The potential impact of this research is twofold: it will provide a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs, and it will inform the development of future models that can more effectively emulate human-like cognitive abilities. This research could also contribute to the broader field of AI by providing a framework for comparing different model architectures and training strategies in cognitive tasks.
