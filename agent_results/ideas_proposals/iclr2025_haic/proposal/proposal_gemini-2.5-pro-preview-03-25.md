**1. Title:** **Mitigating Bias in Human-AI Healthcare Coevolution: A Dynamic Framework for Equitable Long-Term Feedback Loops**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, offering potential for personalized diagnostics, treatment recommendations, and chronic disease management (Lee & Kim, 2023). These systems often operate not in isolation but in continuous interaction with clinicians and patients. This interaction creates a dynamic system where AI outputs influence human decisions and behaviors, which, in turn, generate new data used to adapt the AI. This phenomenon is central to the emerging field of Human-AI Coevolution (HAIC), which studies the reciprocal adaptation processes between humans and AI systems over extended periods (HAIC 2025 Call for Papers).

While HAIC holds promise for improving system performance and user alignment, it simultaneously presents significant challenges, particularly concerning fairness and equity (Smith & Johnson, 2023; S. Lee & Anderson, 2024). AI systems trained on historical data often inherit existing societal biases. When deployed, these biased systems can disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. Critically, the feedback loop inherent in HAIC can amplify these initial biases. For instance, an AI recommending a specific lifestyle change might be less effective for individuals facing socioeconomic barriers; subsequent low adherence from this group could be misinterpreted by the AI as lack of engagement, further marginalizing their needs in future recommendations. This creates a cycle where inequities are not just perpetuated but potentially deepened over time through the coevolutionary process (Brown & Davis, 2023).

Current approaches to AI fairness in healthcare often focus on static interventions, such as pre-processing data or post-processing model outputs based on a snapshot in time (Wilson & Thompson, 2025). However, these static methods fail to account for the dynamic, longitudinal nature of human-AI interactions and the evolving nature of both algorithmic behavior and human responses. They do not adequately address how biases might emerge or shift as humans adapt to the AI and the AI adapts to human feedback.

**2.2 Problem Statement**
The core problem addressed by this research is the lack of frameworks capable of modeling, understanding, and mitigating bias within the dynamic, long-term feedback loops characteristic of Human-AI Coevolution in healthcare. Static fairness interventions overlook the coadaptive nature of these systems, potentially allowing biases to amplify or manifest in unforeseen ways over time. This gap is particularly critical in high-stakes domains like healthcare, where unchecked bias amplification can exacerbate health disparities and undermine patient trust (Patel & Nguyen, 2024). There is an urgent need for methodologies that explicitly account for bidirectional adaptation and enable proactive bias mitigation within these evolving socio-technical systems.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
This research aims to develop and evaluate a novel framework for mitigating bias in longitudinal human-AI interactions within healthcare. The specific objectives are:

1.  **To Develop a Simulation Framework for HAIC in Healthcare:** Construct a computational environment that models the dynamic feedback loop between an adaptive AI agent (providing healthcare recommendations) and simulated patients (adapting their behavior based on AI input and other factors).
2.  **To Design a Bias-Aware Co-Correction Mechanism:** Integrate mechanisms for (a) the AI to dynamically track evolving health disparities using fairness metrics and causal mediation analysis, and (b) simulated patients to recalibrate their engagement based on explanations of AI behavior and potential tradeoffs.
3.  **To Introduce and Operationalize the "Looping Inequity" Metric:** Formalize and implement a metric, *Looping Inequity*, designed to quantify the cumulative impact of sustained human-AI interaction on health equity compared to baseline or static intervention scenarios (building upon the conceptual work of Zhang & Patel, 2025).
4.  **To Validate the Framework via a Case Study:** Implement and evaluate the proposed framework within a simulated diabetes management scenario, comparing its performance in mitigating bias and maintaining clinical effectiveness against baseline and static fairness approaches.

**2.4 Significance**
This research makes several significant contributions. Firstly, it directly addresses a critical gap in AI fairness research by moving beyond static interventions to tackle bias within dynamic HAIC feedback loops. Secondly, it offers a novel hybrid methodology combining simulation, reinforcement learning, causal mediation analysis, and explainability to model and manage long-term coevolutionary dynamics. Thirdly, it operationalizes the *Looping Inequity* metric, providing a much-needed tool for evaluating the longitudinal equity implications of human-AI systems. Fourthly, by focusing on healthcare, it tackles a high-impact domain where equitable AI is paramount. Finally, this work contributes directly to the HAIC 2025 workshop themes by exploring long-term interactions, algorithmic adaptation, bias mitigation, bidirectional learning, dynamic feedback loops in impactful domains, and the ethical implications of coevolving human-AI systems. The proposed framework bridges algorithmic fairness with principles of participatory AI design (Garcia & Martinez, 2023), offering actionable insights for developing more robust, fair, and trustworthy AI systems for long-term healthcare applications.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Research Design**
This research employs a hybrid design involving simulation, algorithmic development, and comparative evaluation. The core components are: (1) a simulation environment modeling longitudinal human-AI interaction in healthcare; (2) the development and integration of a novel Bias-Aware Co-Correction mechanism within the AI agent; (3) validation through a case study comparing the proposed framework against relevant baselines in a simulated diabetes management context.

**3.2 Simulation Framework**

*   **Data:** We will use synthetic longitudinal data generated based on realistic distributions derived from public health datasets (e.g., NHANES) and existing diabetes literature (e.g., Chen & Park, 2024). This approach mitigates privacy concerns while allowing controlled experimentation. The data will include:
    *   Demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, simulated socioeconomic status proxy).
    *   Clinical variables (e.g., baseline HbA1c, comorbidities, simulated medication history).
    *   Behavioral variables (e.g., simulated adherence to diet, exercise, medication; influenced by AI recommendations and patient characteristics).
    *   Contextual variables (e.g., simulated environmental stressors, access to resources).
*   **AI Agent:**
    *   *Model:* A Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, likely based on an Actor-Critic architecture (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO), suitable for continuous action spaces (e.g., lifestyle recommendation intensity) and incorporating feedback.
    *   *State Space ($S$):* Includes current patient clinical status, recent adherence, demographic group, and potentially historical interaction patterns.
    *   *Action Space ($A$):* Represents the AI's recommendations (e.g., personalized adjustments to diet plan, exercise targets, medication reminders).
    *   *Reward Function ($R$):* A composite reward balancing clinical effectiveness (e.g., predicted improvement in glycemic control) and fairness. It dynamically incorporates a penalty based on the detected bias, adjusted by the co-correction mechanism:
        $$R_t = R_{clinical}(s_t, a_t) - \lambda_t \times \text{BiasMetric}_t(s_t, a_t)$$
        where $R_{clinical}$ measures the health outcome improvement, $\text{BiasMetric}_t$ quantifies the disparity across demographic groups at time $t$, and $\lambda_t$ is a dynamically adjusted weight controlling the fairness-utility trade-off. The AI learns a policy $\pi(a_t | s_t)$ to maximize cumulative discounted reward.
*   **Simulated Patient Model:**
    *   Patient adaptation will be modeled based on established behavioral theories (e.g., a simplified Health Belief Model or Theory of Planned Behavior) incorporating factors like perceived severity, benefits, barriers, self-efficacy, and trust in the AI.
    *   *Trust Dynamics:* Patient trust will be modeled as a latent variable $T_t$, updated based on the perceived utility and transparency of AI recommendations. Explanations provided by the AI (see Bias-Aware Co-Correction) will directly influence $T_t$.
    *   *Behavioral Adaptation:* Patient adherence/behavior $B_{t+1}$ will be a function of the AI recommendation $a_t$, patient state $s_t$, trust $T_t$, and stochastic elements representing external factors: $B_{t+1} = f(a_t, s_t, T_t, \epsilon_t)$. This behavior then influences the next state $s_{t+1}$.
*   **Interaction Loop:** The simulation proceeds in discrete time steps (e.g., weekly or monthly updates).
    1.  AI observes patient state $s_t$.
    2.  AI selects action (recommendation) $a_t \sim \pi(a_t | s_t)$.
    3.  AI provides recommendation and potentially an explanation to the simulated patient.
    4.  Simulated patient updates trust $T_t$ and determines behavior $B_{t+1}$ based on $a_t, s_t, T_t$.
    5.  Patient state transitions to $s_{t+1}$ based on $B_{t+1}$ and underlying health dynamics.
    6.  AI receives reward $R_t$ and updates its policy $\pi$. The Bias-Aware Co-Correction mechanism updates $\lambda_t$ and $\text{BiasMetric}_t$.
    7.  Repeat for a predefined duration (e.g., simulating 1-2 years of interaction).

**3.3 Bias-Aware Co-Correction Mechanism**

This mechanism operates concurrently within the simulation loop:

*   **Dynamic Bias Tracking:**
    *   At regular intervals (e.g., every few simulation steps), the system calculates fairness metrics across predefined demographic groups (e.g., based on race/ethnicity, socioeconomic proxy). Metrics will include standard measures like Demographic Parity Difference (DPD) and Equalized Odds Difference (EOD) applied to key intermediate outcomes (e.g., adherence rates) and final health outcomes (e.g., change in HbA1c).
    *   $\text{DPD}_t = |P(\hat{Y}=1 | G=a) - P(\hat{Y}=1 | G=b)|$
    *   $\text{EOD}_t = \frac{1}{2} [ |P(\hat{Y}=1 | Y=1, G=a) - P(\hat{Y}=1 | Y=1, G=b)| + |P(\hat{Y}=1 | Y=0, G=a) - P(\hat{Y}=1 | Y=0, G=b)| ]$
        (where $\hat{Y}$ is the outcome, $Y$ is the true outcome, $G$ is the group attribute).
    *   These metrics constitute $\text{BiasMetric}_t$ used in the AI's reward function.
*   **Causal Mediation Analysis:**
    *   To understand *how* bias propagates, we will periodically apply causal mediation analysis (Martinez & Wang, 2024) using the simulated longitudinal data.
    *   We model the relationship: AI Recommendation ($A$) $\rightarrow$ Patient Behavior/Adherence ($M$) $\rightarrow$ Health Outcome ($Y$), controlling for baseline confounders ($C$) including patient demographics and initial health state.
    *   The analysis estimates the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) and Natural Indirect Effect (NIE) of the AI recommendation on the outcome for different demographic groups.
        $$ \text{Total Effect (TE)} = \text{NDE} + \text{NIE} $$
    *   Disparities in NIE across groups suggest that the AI's influence is unequally mediated by patient behavior, highlighting interactional bias. For example, if the NIE is significantly smaller for a disadvantaged group, it suggests the AI's recommendations are less effective at promoting positive behaviors in that group, potentially due to unmodeled barriers or trust issues.
    *   *Insight Integration:* Insights from the causal analysis inform the AI's adaptation strategy. For example, if a large indirect bias is detected for a specific recommendation type and group, the AI might adjust its exploration strategy to find alternative recommendations for that group or modify the fairness weight $\lambda_t$ more aggressively.
*   **Patient Trust Recalibration via Explainability:**
    *   When the AI provides recommendations, especially if they represent a shift in strategy or involve known tradeoffs (e.g., stricter diet vs. potential burden), simplified explanations will be generated for the simulated patient.
    *   These explanations, potentially inspired by techniques like SHAP or LIME adapted for the RL context, will highlight key factors influencing the recommendation and potentially acknowledge fairness considerations identified by the bias tracking mechanism (Patel & Nguyen, 2024).
    *   The quality and content of these explanations directly impact the simulated patient's trust variable $T_t$, influencing their subsequent adherence $B_{t+1}$. This models the patient-side adaptation in the coevolution loop.

**3.4 Case Study: Diabetes Management**

*   **Rationale:** Diabetes management is a prime candidate due to its chronic nature, significant health disparities across demographics, reliance on continuous patient behavior (diet, exercise, medication adherence), and the increasing use of AI-powered support tools (Chen & Park, 2024).
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Simulated Cohort: Generate a diverse cohort of N (e.g., N=1000) synthetic patients with varying demographics, baseline HbA1c, comorbidities, and simulated behavioral profiles.
    *   AI Task: The RL agent provides personalized weekly recommendations for lifestyle adjustments (e.g., carbohydrate intake targets, physical activity goals) aiming to improve long-term glycemic control (simulated HbA1c).
    *   Simulation Duration: Run simulations for a period equivalent to 1-2 years of patient interaction.
*   **Experimental Design:** We will compare three conditions:
    1.  **Baseline AI:** Standard RL agent optimizing only for clinical effectiveness ($R_t = R_{clinical}$).
    2.  **Static Fairness AI:** RL agent with a fixed fairness constraint applied at the start or using bias mitigation on the initial training data (inspired by Wilson & Thompson, 2025 but without dynamic updates).
    3.  **Proposed Dynamic Framework:** The RL agent incorporating the Bias-Aware Co-Correction mechanism and dynamic feedback loop modeling.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Primary Metrics:**
        *   *Looping Inequity (LI):* Defined as the cumulative divergence in health equity between the dynamic framework and the static fairness baseline over the simulation period. Formally, let $E_t(G)$ be an equity metric (e.g., standard deviation of mean HbA1c across groups $G$) at time $t$.
            $$ LI = \frac{1}{T_{sim}} \sum_{t=1}^{T_{sim}} | E_t^{\text{Dynamic}}(G) - E_t^{\text{Static}}(G) | $$
            Lower LI indicates the dynamic framework maintains equity better over time relative to the static approach. We will also measure absolute equity levels achieved by each method. (Operationalizing Zhang & Patel, 2025).
        *   *Longitudinal Health Disparity:* Difference in average HbA1c improvement between the most and least advantaged demographic groups at the end of the simulation.
        *   *Simulated Patient Empowerment:* Measured via proxy metrics like average adherence rates and stability of trust levels ($T_t$) across groups.
    *   **Secondary Metrics:**
        *   *Overall Clinical Effectiveness:* Average HbA1c reduction across the entire cohort.
        *   *AI Policy Convergence and Stability:* Track changes in the AI's policy and reward components ($\lambda_t$).
        *   *Computational Cost:* Resources required for simulation and co-correction mechanism.

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**
We anticipate the following outcomes from this research:

1.  **Demonstration of Dynamic Bias Amplification:** We expect the Baseline AI simulation to show an increase in health disparities over time, illustrating how standard RL agents can amplify bias in HAIC loops.
2.  **Effectiveness of the Dynamic Framework:** We hypothesize that the proposed Bias-Aware Co-Correction framework will significantly mitigate the amplification of bias compared to both the Baseline AI and the Static Fairness AI. We anticipate achieving a reduction in the final health disparity metric by 25-40% compared to the Baseline, while maintaining comparable or slightly reduced overall clinical effectiveness.
3.  **Validation of the Looping Inequity Metric:** The study will provide empirical validation for the *Looping Inequity* metric as a useful tool for quantifying the longitudinal equity impact of HAIC systems. We expect the proposed framework to exhibit significantly lower LI than the comparison groups.
4.  **Insights into Coevolutionary Dynamics:** The simulation results, particularly the causal mediation analysis, will provide insights into the specific pathways through which bias operates and evolves in human-AI healthcare interactions. This includes understanding how patient 'responses' (adherence, trust) mediate algorithmic impact differently across groups.
5.  **A Ready-to-Adapt Framework:** The research will produce a well-documented simulation framework and algorithmic components (Bias-Aware Co-Correction) adaptable to other healthcare scenarios or HAIC domains.

**4.2 Impact**
This research has the potential for significant impact across several areas:

*   **Advancing HAIC Research:** Provides a concrete methodology for studying and intervening in long-term, dynamic human-AI feedback loops, a core challenge highlighted by the HAIC 2025 workshop. It moves beyond static analysis to embrace the coevolutionary nature of these systems.
*   **Improving AI Fairness in Healthcare:** Offers a novel, dynamic approach to bias mitigation specifically tailored for longitudinal AI applications. This can lead to the development of fairer AI tools for chronic disease management, reducing health disparities exacerbated by technology.
*   **Enhancing Trustworthy AI:** By incorporating explainability and explicitly addressing fairness dynamics, the framework contributes to building more trustworthy and human-aligned AI systems, potentially improving patient acceptance and engagement (Patel & Nguyen, 2024).
*   **Developing Better Evaluation Methods:** The operationalization and validation of the *Looping Inequity* metric provide the field with a new tool to assess AI systems not just on point-in-time performance or fairness, but on their long-term equity implications within interactive contexts.
*   **Informing Ethical Deployment:** The findings will provide crucial evidence regarding the potential risks of bias amplification in HAIC systems and offer practical strategies for mitigation, informing ethical guidelines and deployment practices for AI in sensitive domains like healthcare (S. Lee & Anderson, 2024).
*   **Bridging Disciplinary Gaps:** This work integrates concepts from ML (RL, fairness), causal inference, human-computer interaction (trust, explainability), and healthcare, fostering interdisciplinary understanding crucial for tackling complex socio-technical challenges.

In conclusion, this research proposes a rigorous and innovative approach to address the critical challenge of bias in dynamic human-AI coevolution within healthcare. By developing and validating a novel framework incorporating simulation, dynamic bias correction, causal analysis, and a new longitudinal equity metric, we aim to provide both theoretical insights and practical tools for building fairer and more effective AI systems for long-term human collaboration.
