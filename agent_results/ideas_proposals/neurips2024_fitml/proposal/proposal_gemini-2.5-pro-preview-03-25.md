**1. Title: Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning (RGFT): Adaptive Resource Allocation for Efficient Model Adaptation**

**2. Introduction**

**(a) Background:**
The advent of large pre-trained models (PTMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has revolutionized machine learning, offering state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. These models capture general-purpose knowledge from vast datasets, which can then be adapted to specific downstream applications through a process called fine-tuning. Fine-tuning typically involves updating the parameters of the PTM using task-specific data, allowing the model to specialize while leveraging its pre-trained capabilities (transfer learning).

However, the sheer scale of modern PTMs presents significant challenges. Full fine-tuning, which updates all model parameters, is computationally prohibitive, requiring substantial memory, processing power, and training time. This hinders the deployment of large models in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or scenarios with limited computational budgets. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as adapter tuning, prefix tuning, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), have emerged as popular alternatives (Han et al., 2024). These methods aim to reduce the computational burden by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters or introducing a small number of new parameters.

While PEFT methods significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters, they often apply updates somewhat uniformly within the selected subset or added modules. They typically lack mechanisms to dynamically prioritize updates based on the model's ongoing performance during fine-tuning. Intuitively, not all parts of a large model contribute equally to errors on a specific downstream task. Some components might already perform well due to pre-training, while others might be the primary sources of prediction residuals (errors). Applying uniform update pressure across all targeted parameters can be inefficient â€“ wasting resources on well-adapted components and potentially under-optimizing critical, error-prone areas. This inefficiency motivates the need for more adaptive and targeted fine-tuning strategies.

**(b) Problem Statement:**
Current fine-tuning paradigms, including full fine-tuning and many PEFT methods, largely overlook the heterogeneous contribution of different model components to task-specific errors. This leads to suboptimal resource allocation during the adaptation process. Full fine-tuning incurs excessive computational costs, while existing PEFT methods, although reducing parameter count, may not direct the limited updates to the most impactful areas of the model. As identified in the literature review, key challenges include accurately identifying error-prone components, dynamically allocating computational resources without significant overhead, maintaining model stability during adaptive updates (Fu et al., 2023), and scaling these techniques to extremely large models. Furthermore, while some recent works explore error analysis or dynamic adaptation_ (Doe et al., 2024; White et al., 2024; Black et al., 2025; Fan et al., 2025; Orange et al., 2024)_, a cohesive framework that integrates fine-grained error attribution across components, dynamic resource allocation based on this attribution, and theoretical grounding for stability and convergence remains an active area of research.

**(c) Proposed Solution: Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning (RGFT):**
We propose Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning (RGFT), a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning large pre-trained models. RGFT operates on the principle that computational resources for fine-tuning should be dynamically allocated based on observed error patterns. It continuously monitors the model's prediction residuals during the fine-tuning process and attributes these errors back to specific components of the model (e.g., layers, attention heads, or specific parameter groups). This process generates a dynamic "error map" highlighting which parts of the network are consistently contributing to incorrect predictions.

Based on this error map, RGFT employs an adaptive update strategy. Components identified as high-error contributors receive larger or more frequent updates (e.g., higher effective learning rates or less sparsity), while components that perform well receive minimal or no updates. This targeted approach aims to concentrate the computational effort where it is most needed, potentially achieving performance comparable to more resource-intensive methods but with significantly reduced computational cost (e.g., FLOPs, training time). RGFT encompasses three key technical contributions:
    1.  A mechanism for tracking residuals and attributing error contribution to distinct model components.
    2.  A dynamic update strategy (e.g., adaptive learning rates or selective parameter updates) guided by the component-level error signals.
    3.  A supporting theoretical analysis investigating the convergence properties and stability of the adaptive fine-tuning process.

**(d) Research Objectives:**
The primary objectives of this research are:
    1.  To develop a robust and efficient mechanism for tracking prediction residuals and attributing error contributions to pre-defined components (e.g., layers, attention heads, PEFT modules) within large pre-trained models during fine-tuning.
    2.  To design and implement a dynamic update strategy (RGFT) that adaptively adjusts the magnitude or frequency of parameter updates for different components based on their attributed error scores.
    3.  To theoretically analyze the convergence behavior and stability of the proposed RGFT framework, building upon existing analyses of adaptive optimization and fine-tuning stability (Fu et al., 2023; Grey et al., 2023).
    4.  To empirically validate the effectiveness and efficiency of RGFT across diverse tasks and model architectures (including LLMs), comparing it against standard full fine-tuning and state-of-the-art PEFT methods.
    5.  To investigate the properties of the learned "error maps" and their potential utility for model interpretability and understanding fine-tuning dynamics.

**(e) Significance:**
This research directly addresses the critical need for more efficient and scalable fine-tuning methods, a central theme of the FITML workshop. By enabling targeted adaptation based on error analysis, RGFT offers a pathway to significantly reduce the computational resources required for fine-tuning large models without sacrificing performance. This has profound implications for:
    *   **Resource Efficiency:** Making large model adaptation feasible in environments with limited computational budgets, including edge computing (Cyan et al., 2025).
    *   **Scalability:** Providing a more sustainable approach to fine-tuning ever-larger models.
    *   **Understanding Fine-Tuning:** Offering insights into how different parts of a pre-trained model adapt to new tasks and where the pre-training knowledge falls short. The generated error maps could serve as a diagnostic tool.
    *   **Advancing PEFT:** Introducing a dynamic, performance-aware dimension to parameter-efficient techniques.

Successfully achieving the research objectives would represent a significant step forward in making powerful AI models more accessible, adaptable, and efficient, contributing directly to the theoretical and empirical frontiers of fine-tuning in modern machine learning.

**3. Methodology**

**(a) Conceptual Framework:**
RGFT is based on the hypothesis that directing fine-tuning updates towards model components that are demonstrably contributing more to prediction errors will lead to faster convergence and more efficient resource utilization compared to uniform update strategies. It conceptualizes the fine-tuning process not just as parameter optimization but as targeted error correction. RGFT integrates error signal computation, component attribution, and adaptive parameter updates into a cohesive loop within the standard fine-tuning workflow. While related works touch upon error analysis or dynamic updates (Doe et al., 2024; White et al., 2024; Black et al., 2025), RGFT aims to provide a more fine-grained, adaptive, and theoretically grounded framework specifically designed for efficiency in large model fine-tuning.

**(b) Residual Tracking and Error Attribution:**
Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the pre-trained model parameterized by $\theta$. During fine-tuning on a dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ with loss function $L(y, \hat{y})$, where $\hat{y} = \mathcal{M}(x; \theta)$, the residual for a sample $i$ is related to the loss $L(y_i, \hat{y}_i)$. We need to attribute this loss or its gradient back to specific components of the model.

We define a set of model components $C = \{C_1, C_2, ..., C_K\}$, where each $C_k$ represents a logical unit of the model (e.g., a transformer layer, an attention head, a feed-forward network within a layer, or even parameters associated with a PEFT module like LoRA matrices $A_k, B_k$). Let $\theta_k$ be the parameters associated with component $C_k$.

The core idea is to estimate the "error contribution" of each component $C_k$. We propose to use the magnitude of the gradients with respect to the component's parameters as a proxy for its contribution to reducing the loss on the current batch $\mathcal{B}$. At each training step $t$, we compute the gradient of the batch loss $L_{\mathcal{B}}(\theta^{(t)})$ with respect to all parameters $\theta^{(t)}$. The raw error score for component $C_k$ at step $t$ could be defined as:
$$ s_k^{(t)} = \| \nabla_{\theta_k} L_{\mathcal{B}}(\theta^{(t)}) \|_p $$
where $\| \cdot \|_p$ denotes an appropriate norm (e.g., $p=1$ or $p=2$).

To obtain a more stable signal reflecting consistent error contribution, we maintain an exponential moving average (EMA) of these scores for each component:
$$ E_k^{(t)} = \beta E_k^{(t-1)} + (1 - \beta) s_k^{(t)} $$
where $E_k^{(0)} = 0$ and $\beta \in [0, 1)$ is a decay factor (hyperparameter). This $E_k^{(t)}$ represents the dynamic error score for component $C_k$ at step $t$, forming the basis of our "error map".

**(c) Dynamic Update Strategy:**
The error scores $\{E_k^{(t)}\}_{k=1}^K$ guide the allocation of updates. We propose an adaptive learning rate scheme. Instead of a single learning rate $\eta$, each component $C_k$ will have its effective learning rate $\eta_k^{(t)}$ adjusted based on its error score $E_k^{(t)}$. The parameter update rule for parameters $\theta_k$ in component $C_k$ becomes:
$$ \theta_k^{(t+1)} = \theta_k^{(t)} - \eta_k^{(t)} \cdot (\nabla_{\theta_k} L_{\mathcal{B}}(\theta^{(t)}) + \lambda \theta_k^{(t)}) $$
(Assuming standard SGD or Adam optimizer structure, applied component-wise with adaptive LR; $\lambda$ is weight decay).

The adaptive learning rate $\eta_k^{(t)}$ is determined by the base learning rate $\eta_0$ and the component's error score relative to others:
$$ \eta_k^{(t)} = \eta_0 \cdot f(E_k^{(t)}, \{E_j^{(t)}\}_{j=1}^K) $$
Here, $f(\cdot)$ is a scaling function that maps error scores to learning rate multipliers. Potential choices for $f$ include:
    1.  **Normalized Scaling:** Scale LR proportionally to the normalized error score. e.g., $f = 1 + \alpha \cdot \frac{E_k^{(t)}}{\max_j E_j^{(t)}}$ or $f = 1 + \alpha \cdot \frac{E_k^{(t)}}{\sum_j E_j^{(t)}} K$. $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter controlling modulation strength.
    2.  **Rank-Based Scaling:** Assign higher LRs to components with higher error score ranks.
    3.  **Thresholding/Sparsification:** Set $\eta_k^{(t)} = \eta_0$ if $E_k^{(t)}$ is above a certain threshold (e.g., top $P\%$ of scores) and $\eta_k^{(t)} = 0$ or a very small value otherwise. This implements a form of dynamic sparsification of updates.

We will primarily investigate the normalized scaling approach due to its smooth adaptation but will explore thresholding in ablation studies. The definition of components $C_k$ is crucial. We will experiment with different granularities:
    *   Per layer.
    *   Per attention head + FFN block within layers.
    *   If using PEFT like LoRA, per LoRA matrix pair ($A_k, B_k$).

**(d) Theoretical Analysis:**
We aim to provide theoretical insights into RGFT, focusing on convergence and stability.
    *   **Convergence:** We will extend existing convergence analyses for SGD/Adam (e.g., based on assumptions like Lipschitz smooth gradients) to our adaptive, component-wise learning rate scheme. We hypothesize that if the error scores $E_k^{(t)}$ stabilize or change slowly relative to the optimization process, convergence guarantees similar to standard adaptive methods (like Adam) can be established. Key challenges include handling the dependence of $\eta_k^{(t)}$ on the gradients themselves (via $s_k^{(t)}$). We will leverage techniques used in analyzing adaptive learning rates and potentially relate to work by Grey et al. (2023).
    *   **Stability:** We will analyze RGFT's stability, particularly concerning catastrophic forgetting and divergence. We posit that by reducing updates to well-performing (low-error) components, RGFT might implicitly preserve pre-trained knowledge better than full fine-tuning. We can draw parallels with stability analyses like Fu et al. (2023) and investigate if RGFT meets conditions for stable fine-tuning. We will analyze how the adaptive LRs interact with model dynamics.

**(e) Experimental Design:**
Our empirical validation will focus on demonstrating RGFT's efficiency gains and performance competitiveness.
    *   **Tasks and Datasets:** We will use standard benchmarks:
        *   **NLP:** GLUE benchmark (various classification/NLI tasks), SuperGLUE (more challenging NLP tasks), potentially a sequence generation task (e.g., summarization on XSum). This evaluates RGFT on diverse language understanding capabilities.
        *   **(Optional) CV:** Image classification on standard datasets like CIFAR-100 or subset of ImageNet, fine-tuning models like ViT.
    *   **Models:** We will use widely adopted pre-trained models:
        *   BERT-base/large
        *   RoBERTa-base/large
        *   T5-small/base
        *   Potentially a publicly available LLM (e.g., Llama-2 7B, Gemma 7B) if resources permit.
    *   **Baselines:** We will compare RGFT against:
        *   **Full Fine-Tuning:** Updates all parameters.
        *   **Standard PEFT:** LoRA, possibly Adapter tuning. Use implementations from libraries like Hugging Face's PEFT.
        *   **Uniform Update PEFT:** LoRA/Adapters with uniform learning rate across all tunable PEFT parameters (standard practice).
        *   **(If possible) Re-implementations or conceptually similar methods:** Based on Doe et al. (2024) or White et al. (2024), if details are sufficient.
    *   **RGFT Implementation:** We will implement RGFT within a standard framework like PyTorch. Key hyperparameters will include the EMA decay $\beta$, the LR modulation factor $\alpha$ (or threshold parameters), and the component definition granularity.
    *   **Evaluation Metrics:**
        *   **Task Performance:** Standard metrics for each task (e.g., Accuracy, F1 score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient for GLUE; ROUGE for summarization; Accuracy for classification).
        *   **Computational Efficiency:**
            *   Total FLOPs for fine-tuning.
            *   Wall-clock training time.
            *   Number of parameters updated per step / over the entire training.
            *   Peak GPU memory usage.
        *   **Convergence Speed:** Performance achieved per epoch or per computational unit (e.g., FLOPs).
        *   **Stability:** Performance on pre-training related tasks or out-of-distribution data related to the original capabilities (inspired by Mai et al., 2024) could be assessed to check for catastrophic forgetting, although this is a secondary objective.
    *   **Ablation Studies:**
        *   Impact of component granularity (layer vs. head/FFN vs. PEFT module).
        *   Sensitivity to hyperparameters ($\beta$, $\alpha$, choice of norm $p$, choice of scaling function $f$).
        *   Contribution of residual tracking vs. dynamic updates (e.g., compare RGFT to random allocation of updates with the same budget).
        *   Analysis of the generated "error maps": visualize $E_k^{(t)}$ over time and across components; correlate high-error components with task characteristics.

It addresses challenges of scalability and resource efficiency head-on.
    *   **Foundation for Future Work:** The concepts of component-wise error attribution and adaptive updates can be extended to other areas, such as continual learning (mitigating catastrophic forgetting by freezing low-error components), model compression, and neural architecture search. The generated error maps might also find use in model explainability and debugging.

By successfully executing this research plan, we aim to contribute a valuable tool and deeper understanding to the rapidly evolving landscape of large model fine-tuning, pushing the boundaries of efficiency and scalability in modern machine learning.
