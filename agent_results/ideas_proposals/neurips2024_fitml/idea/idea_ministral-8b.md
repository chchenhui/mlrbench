### Title: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models using Low-Rank Factorization

### Motivation:
The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant computational and memory demands, making their fine-tuning challenging within constrained resources. Efficient fine-tuning methods are crucial for practical deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. This research aims to address the computational inefficiencies of fine-tuning LLMs by leveraging low-rank factorization techniques.

### Main Idea:
This research proposes a novel methodology for efficient fine-tuning of LLMs using low-rank factorization. The approach involves decomposing the model parameters into lower-dimensional subspaces, enabling faster and more memory-efficient updates during fine-tuning. The methodology combines theoretical insights from sketching and signal recovery with empirical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

The proposed methodology includes:
1. **Low-Rank Decomposition**: Decompose the original LLM parameters into a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix, significantly reducing the parameter space.
2. **Efficient Gradient Updates**: Utilize the low-rank structure to perform efficient gradient updates, leveraging the sparsity to accelerate convergence.
3. **Experimental Validation**: Conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures and fine-tuning tasks to validate the proposed approach.

Expected outcomes include:
- Reduced computational and memory requirements for fine-tuning LLMs.
- Faster convergence and improved generalization performance.
- Practical deployment of LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Potential impact:
This research will contribute to the theoretical understanding of fine-tuning in machine learning, particularly in the context of LLMs. It will provide a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs, enabling broader adoption and practical deployment in various applications.
