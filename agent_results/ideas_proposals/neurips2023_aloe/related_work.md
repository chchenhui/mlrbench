1. **Title**: CurricuLLM: Automatic Task Curricula Design for Learning Complex Robot Skills using Large Language Models (arXiv:2409.18382)
   - **Authors**: Kanghyun Ryu, Qiayuan Liao, Zhongyu Li, Koushil Sreenath, Negar Mehr
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces CurricuLLM, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate curriculum design in reinforcement learning (RL). CurricuLLM generates sequences of subtasks in natural language, translates them into executable code, and evaluates trained policies based on trajectory rollouts. The approach is validated across various robotics simulation environments, demonstrating its effectiveness in facilitating the learning of complex robot control tasks. Additionally, the learned policies are successfully transferred to real-world humanoid locomotion tasks.

   - **Authors**: Minqi Jiang
   - **Summary**: This thesis develops Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), a class of methods aimed at producing open-ended learning processes in RL. UED automatically generates an infinite sequence of training environments at the frontier of the agent's capabilities, promoting robustness and generalization. The work provides theoretical foundations and empirical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of UED in creating RL agents capable of continually mastering new challenges.

4. **Title**: ExploRLLM: Guiding Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Models (arXiv:2403.09583)
   - **Authors**: Runyu Ma, Jelle Luijkx, Zlatan Ajanovic, Jens Kober
   - **Summary**: ExploRLLM combines the commonsense reasoning of foundation models with the experiential learning capabilities of RL. The method uses foundation models to obtain a base policy, an efficient representation, and an exploration policy. A residual RL agent learns when and how to deviate from the base policy, with exploration guided by the exploration policy. Experiments in table-top manipulation tasks demonstrate that ExploRLLM outperforms both baseline foundation model policies and baseline RL policies, with successful transfer to real-world scenarios without further training.
