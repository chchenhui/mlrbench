**Title:**  
LLM-Driven Self-Generating Adaptive Curricula for Sustained Open-Ended Reinforcement Learning  

---

### 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Open-ended learning (OEL) aims to create agents that continually adapt to novel challenges, mirroring the perpetual skill acquisition seen in biological systems. While deep reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) have advanced agent capabilities, most systems stagnate once predefined tasks are mastered. This limitation stems from static training environments and handcrafted curricula, which fail to generate emergent challenges that drive sustained learning. Recent work in *Unsupervised Environment Design* (UED) and LLM-driven curriculum generation (e.g., CurricuLLM, ExploRLLM) highlights the potential of automating task creation. However, these methods often lack mechanisms to ensure task diversity, relevance, and alignment with real-world complexity.  

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal addresses these gaps by developing a framework where an LLM acts as a *meta-controller* to generate adaptive curricula for RL agents. The objectives are:  
1. **Automated Task Generation**: Use LLMs to synthesize tasks targeting the agent’s current skill gaps.  
2. **Quality-Diversity Filtering**: Ensure tasks are novel, impactful, and scalable via multi-objective optimization.  
3. **Sustained Open-Ended Learning**: Validate that the curriculum enables agents to master increasingly complex, emergent challenges.  
4. **Sim2Real Generalization**: Demonstrate improved transfer to real-world tasks compared to fixed curricula.  

**Significance**  
By integrating LLMs with RL in a closed-loop system, this work aims to advance OEL theory and practice. Success would reduce reliance on human-designed curricula, enable agents to adapt to dynamic real-world environments (e.g., robotics, autonomous systems), and provide insights into the self-reinforcing dynamics of LLM-agent ecosystems.

### 2. Methodology  

#### 2.1 Framework Overview  
The system comprises three components:  
1. **Agent Policy ($\pi_\theta$)**: A reinforcement learning agent (e.g., PPO, SAC) interacting with environments.  
2. **LLM-Based Meta-Controller**: Generates task specifications using failure analysis and skill gap detection.  
3. **Quality-Diversity (QD) Filter**: Selects tasks that maximize novelty, learning potential, and difficulty.  

The workflow iterates as follows:  
1. The agent collects trajectories in current tasks, logging states, actions, and rewards.  
2. Failure modes and skill gaps are identified using anomaly detection (e.g., low reward regions, high variance).  
3. The LLM generates candidate tasks targeting these gaps, encoded as procedural environment parameters.  
4. The QD filter selects tasks for the next training phase.  
5. The agent trains on the new tasks, and the cycle repeats.  

#### 2.2 Task Generation via LLMs  
The LLM (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA-3) is prompted with a structured template:  
```  
[AGENT PERFORMANCE]: {success_rate: 0.65, failure_modes: ["obstacle_avoidance", "partial_observability"]}  
[ENVIRONMENT DOMAIN]: Robotics locomotion  
[OUTPUT]: Generate 5 tasks that combine obstacle avoidance with partial observability, varying terrain and sensor noise.  
```  
Tasks are output as JSON parameters (e.g., `{"terrain_type": "icy", "sensor_noise": 0.3}`) and translated into executable environments via a procedural generator.  

**Mathematical Formulation**  
Let $T_t$ denote the task distribution at iteration $t$. The LLM generates candidate tasks $T_{cand}$ conditioned on the agent’s performance history $H_t$:  
$$  
T_{cand} \sim P_{\text{LLM}}(T \mid H_t), \quad H_t = \{ (s_i, a_i, r_i) \}_{i=1}^N  
$$  

#### 2.3 Quality-Diversity Filter  
The QD filter optimizes two objectives:  
1. **Learning Potential ($\mathcal{L}$)**: Estimated improvement if the agent trains on task $T$:  
   $$  
   \mathcal{L}(T) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta} \left[ R(T) \right] - \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}} \left[ R(T) \right]  
   $$  
2. **Novelty ($\mathcal{N}$)**: Distance from existing tasks in a behavior descriptor space:  
   $$  
   \mathcal{N}(T) = \min_{T' \in T_{1:t}} \| \phi(T) - \phi(T') \|_2  
   $$  
   where $\phi(T)$ encodes task features (e.g., terrain complexity, reward sparsity).  

Tasks are selected via Pareto optimization:  
$$  
T_{t+1} = \argmax_{T \in T_{cand}} \left[ \alpha \mathcal{L}(T) + (1-\alpha) \mathcal{N}(T) \right]  
$$  

#### 2.4 Agent Training  
The agent updates its policy using RL with a curriculum-adjusted objective:  
$$  
\theta_{t+1} = \argmax_\theta \mathbb{E}_{T \sim T_{t+1}} \left[ \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta} \sum \gamma^t r_t \right] - \beta \cdot \text{KL}(\pi_\theta \| \pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})  
$$  
where $\beta$ controls policy stability.  

#### 2.5 Experimental Design  
**Environments**:  
- **Simulation**: Robotics locomotion (MuJoCo), ProcGen benchmarks, and custom grid-worlds with procedurally generated obstacles.  
- **Real-World Transfer**: Spot robot navigation, drone control.  

**Baselines**:  
1. Fixed curricula (e.g., handcrafted sequences).  
2. Random task generation.  
3. UED methods (e.g., PAIRED).  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
1. **ODD-Score**: Measures task difficulty relative to agent capabilities:  
   $$  
   \text{ODD}(T) = \frac{1 - \mathbb{E}[R(T)]}{\text{Var}(R(T))}  
   $$  
2. **Task Diversity**: Average pairwise distance in $\phi(T)$ space.  
3. **Generalization**: Success rate on held-out test tasks.  
4. **Sim2Real Gap**: Performance difference between simulation and real-world deployment.  

**Computational Efficiency**: Track GPU/CPU usage and training time per iteration.
