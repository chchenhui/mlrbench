**Research Proposal: HyperPrompt: Dynamic Hyperparameter Adaptation in RL via LLM-Based Meta-Learning**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in domains such as robotics, game playing, and logistics. However, its application remains hindered by the brittleness of hyperparameter configurations, such as learning rates, discount factors, and exploration rates. Traditional hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods, including grid search and Bayesian optimization, are computationally expensive and fail to adapt dynamically during training. Recent AutoML approaches like *OptFormer* have automated offline hyperparameter tuning but lack real-time adaptability, limiting their utility in evolving RL environments. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown unprecedented in-context learning capabilities, raising the question: *Can LLMs act as meta-learners to dynamically adjust hyperparameters during RL training*, thereby reducing human intervention and improving generalization?  

**Research Objectives**  
This research proposes **HyperPrompt**, a framework that integrates LLMs with meta-reinforcement learning to automate hyperparameter adaptation. The key objectives are:  
1. Develop a meta-training pipeline to finetune LLMs on diverse RL tasks, enabling them to predict optimal hyperparameter schedules.  
2. Design a real-time prompting mechanism where the LLM dynamically adjusts hyperparameters based on environment feedback.  
3. Validate the framework’s robustness, sample efficiency, and generalization across procedurally generated environments (e.g., NetHack, Procgen).  
4. Establish theoretical connections between hyperparameter adaptation and meta-policy optimization in partially observable settings.  

**Significance**  
By combining the in-context learning of LLMs with meta-RL, HyperPrompt aims to address critical challenges in AutoRL:  
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Automatically adjust hyperparameters as learning landscapes evolve.  
- **Reduced Expertise Dependency**: Democratize RL by minimizing manual tuning.  
- **Cross-Environment Generalization**: Enable seamless transfer of learned hyperparameter policies to unseen tasks.

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### 2.1 **Research Design**  
HyperPrompt operates in two phases: **meta-training** (offline tuning of the LLM) and **deployment** (real-time hyperparameter adaptation).  

**Data Collection**  
- **Task Suite**: Curate a diverse set of RL environments (e.g., Procgen, MiniGrid) with varying dynamics, reward structures, and partial observability.  
- **Hyperparameter Trajectories**: For each task, collect trajectories of hyperparameter configurations, performance metrics (e.g., returns, losses), and state-action histories during training.  
- **Prompt-Response Pairs**: Encode hyperparameter adjustment decisions as text-based prompts paired with optimal responses (e.g., *“Returns decreased by 15% in the last 100 steps; adjust learning rate from 0.001 to…”*).  

#### 2.2 **Algorithmic Framework**  

**Meta-Training Phase**  
1. **Task Sampling**: For each meta-training iteration, sample an RL task $\mathcal{T}_i$ from the suite.  
2. **Rollout Collection**: Train an RL agent on $\mathcal{T}_i$ using a base algorithm (e.g., PPO), recording trajectories $\tau = (s_t, a_t, r_t, h_t)$, where $h_t$ denotes hyperparameters at step $t$.  
3. **Prompt Encoding**: For each trajectory snippet $\tau_{t-k:t}$, generate a text prompt $P_t$ describing the recent performance metrics and hyperparameter history (see Figure 1).  
4. **LLM Finetuning**: Train the LLM to predict the next hyperparameter update $h_{t+1}$ by minimizing the loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{T}_i, \tau} \left[ \| h_{t+1} - \text{LLM}_\theta(P_t) \|^2 \right] + \lambda \cdot \text{KL}\left( \pi_{\text{LLM}} \| \pi_{\text{prior}} \right),
$$  
where $\pi_{\text{prior}}$ is a regularization prior to prevent divergence, and $\lambda$ controls its weight.  

**Deployment Phase**  
1. **Real-Time Prompting**: For a new task, initialize the base RL algorithm with default hyperparameters. At interval $\Delta t$, feed the LLM a prompt $P_t$ summarizing the agent’s recent trajectory.  
2. **Hyperparameter Adjustment**: The LLM generates an updated hyperparameter configuration $h_{t+\Delta t}$, which is applied to the RL agent.  
3. **Meta-Policy Integration**: Treat hyperparameter adjustment as a meta-policy $\pi_\phi(h | P_t)$, optimized via gradient descent on the agent’s long-term return:  
$$
\phi^* = \arg\max_\phi \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\phi} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^T \gamma^t r_t \right].
$$  

#### 2.3 **Experimental Design**  

**Baselines**  
Compare HyperPrompt against:  
1. **Static Hyperparameters**: Fixed configurations from prior work.  
2. **OptFormer**: Offline HPO using Transformer-based black-box optimization.  
3. **Population-Based Training (PBT)**: Gradient-free hyperparameter adaptation via evolutionary methods.  

**Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Sample Efficiency**: Average return vs. environment steps.  
- **Robustness**: Performance variance across 10 seeds.  
- **Generalization**: Zero-shot transfer accuracy to unseen Procgen levels.  
- **Wall-Clock Time**: Training duration relative to baselines.  

**Benchmarks**  
- **Procgen**: 16 procedurally generated game environments.  
- **NetHack**: Roguelike game requiring long-horizon planning.  
- **Meta-World ML45**: 45 robotic manipulation tasks.  

**Statistical Analysis**  
Use bootstrapped confidence intervals and paired t-tests to validate significance (p < 0.05).

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Dynamic Hyperparameter Schedules**: HyperPrompt will generate context-aware hyperparameter updates that outperform static and offline AutoML baselines.  
2. **Improved Sample Efficiency**: Anticipate a 15–30% reduction in training steps required to reach target performance thresholds.  
3. **Generalization Guarantees**: The framework will demonstrate >80% success rate on unseen Procgen tasks, validating cross-environment adaptability.  

**Broader Impact**  
- **Democratizing RL**: Lower entry barriers for non-experts by automating hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Eco-Efficiency**: Reduce computational waste from exhaustive grid searches.  
- **Synergy with AutoML**: Catalyze interdisciplinary research by integrating LLMs, meta-learning, and HPO.  

**Ethical Considerations**  
- **Bias Mitigation**: Audit hyperparameter policies for unintended biases (e.g., overfitting to specific reward functions).  
- **Transparency**: Develop visualization tools to interpret the LLM’s decision-making process.

**Conclusion**  
By synthesizing advances in LLMs, meta-learning, and AutoML, HyperPrompt offers a novel pathway to dynamic hyperparameter adaptation in RL. This research will contribute both a practical framework for RL practitioners and theoretical insights into the role of meta-policies in AutoRL. Successful validation could redefine how hyperparameters are optimized, accelerating the deployment of RL in real-world applications.
