# HyperPrompt: Dynamic Hyperparameter Adaptation in Reinforcement Learning via LLM-Based Meta-Learning

## 1. Introduction

Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in various domains, from games like Chess and Go to practical applications in robotics, chemistry, and logistics. Despite these achievements, RL remains notoriously brittle, with performance highly dependent on hyperparameter choices that are often manually tuned through tedious trial-and-error processes. Recent research has shown that seemingly minor changes in hyperparameter settings can lead to drastically different outcomes (Eimer et al., 2023), highlighting the critical importance of hyperparameter optimization (HPO) in RL.

Traditionally, HPO in RL has been approached as an offline optimization problem, where configurations are selected before training and remain fixed throughout the learning process. However, as demonstrated by Mohan et al. (2023), hyperparameter landscapes in RL are dynamic and evolve significantly during training. This suggests that static hyperparameter configurations are inherently suboptimal, as the ideal settings at the beginning of training may become ineffective as the agent progresses.

The field of Automated Reinforcement Learning (AutoRL) has emerged to address these challenges, aiming to develop methods that can automatically configure and optimize RL algorithms with minimal human intervention. While existing approaches like population-based training and Bayesian optimization have shown promise, they typically require substantial computational resources and lack the ability to leverage prior knowledge from related tasks.

Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains, including in-context learning and few-shot adaptation. Recent work on LLM agents and meta-learning frameworks suggests that these models can effectively reason about complex tasks and adapt their behavior based on observed patterns. This raises an intriguing possibility: can LLMs serve as meta-controllers that dynamically adjust RL hyperparameters during training, adapting to the evolving needs of the learning process?

This research proposal introduces HyperPrompt, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as meta-learners for dynamic hyperparameter adaptation in RL. By treating hyperparameter adjustment as a meta-reinforcement learning problem, HyperPrompt aims to learn policies that can predict optimal hyperparameter schedules based on real-time feedback from the training process. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the robustness, sample efficiency, and accessibility of RL algorithms, particularly in novel environments where manual tuning is challenging.

The primary objectives of this research are:

1. Develop a meta-learning framework that enables LLMs to predict optimal hyperparameter adjustments based on training trajectories and performance metrics.
2. Design efficient representation methods to encode RL training dynamics into prompts suitable for LLM processing.
3. Implement and evaluate the HyperPrompt framework across diverse RL environments, with a focus on procedurally generated benchmarks that test generalization capabilities.
4. Compare the performance of LLM-guided hyperparameter adaptation against traditional HPO methods and fixed schedules.

The successful development of HyperPrompt would represent a significant advancement in AutoRL, potentially democratizing access to effective RL techniques by reducing the expertise and computational resources required for hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, by bridging the gap between LLMs and RL, this research contributes to the broader goal of integrating natural language processing capabilities into reinforcement learning systems.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 System Overview

The HyperPrompt framework consists of three main components:

1. **Base RL Agent**: A standard RL algorithm (e.g., PPO, SAC, DQN) that interacts with the environment and learns a policy.
2. **LLM-based Meta-Controller**: A pre-trained LLM fine-tuned to predict optimal hyperparameter adjustments based on training trajectories.
3. **Training Monitor**: A module that collects and processes training statistics, trajectory snippets, and performance metrics to generate prompts for the LLM.

The system operates in an iterative fashion, with the LLM periodically proposing hyperparameter adjustments based on the observed training dynamics. Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of HyperPrompt.

### 2.2 LLM Training and Adaptation

#### 2.2.1 Meta-Training Dataset Construction

To train the LLM as a hyperparameter controller, we will construct a dataset of RL training episodes, each annotated with hyperparameter configurations, trajectories, and performance metrics. This dataset will be generated by:

1. Running multiple RL training runs with different hyperparameter schedules across diverse environments.
2. Collecting time series of performance metrics, agent behaviors, and gradient statistics.
3. Identifying successful hyperparameter adaptation patterns that led to improved performance.

The dataset will include examples from various RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN) and environment types (discrete/continuous control, partially observable, sparse reward), ensuring broad coverage of RL problem characteristics.

#### 2.2.2 Prompt Engineering and Representation

We design a structured prompt format that encodes relevant information about the training process:

$$
P = [C_{env}; H_{curr}; M_{recent}; T_{sample}; H_{history}]
$$

where:
- $C_{env}$ is a textual description of the environment and task
- $H_{curr}$ is the current hyperparameter configuration
- $M_{recent}$ are recent performance metrics (e.g., rewards, value loss)
- $T_{sample}$ are sampled trajectory snippets
- $H_{history}$ is the history of previous hyperparameter adjustments and their effects

For numerical data representation, we will employ techniques such as:
1. Quantile-based normalization to handle varying scales
2. Moving average summaries to capture trends
3. Textual descriptions of key statistics (e.g., "reward is increasing but gradient norms are exploding")

#### 2.2.3 LLM Fine-tuning

We will fine-tune a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama-3, GPT-4) using the meta-training dataset. The fine-tuning objective will be:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{finetune} = \mathbb{E}_{(P, H^*) \sim \mathcal{D}} [\log p_\theta(H^* | P)]
$$

where $P$ is the prompt sequence, $H^*$ is the target hyperparameter adjustment, and $\mathcal{D}$ is the meta-training dataset.

To prevent overfitting and encourage generalization, we will employ:
1. Dropout and data augmentation techniques
2. Curriculum learning that gradually increases the complexity of presented scenarios
3. Diverse environment sampling to improve cross-domain transfer

### 2.3 Dynamic Hyperparameter Adaptation

#### 2.3.1 Hyperparameter Space

We focus on the following key hyperparameters that significantly impact RL performance:

1. Learning rate ($\alpha$)
2. Discount factor ($\gamma$)
3. Entropy coefficient ($\beta$)
4. Exploration parameters (e.g., $\epsilon$ in $\epsilon$-greedy)
5. Neural network architecture parameters (width, depth)
6. Batch size and replay buffer settings

For each hyperparameter, we define valid ranges and potential adjustment operations (e.g., multiplicative scaling, additive adjustments, or replacement).

#### 2.3.2 Adaptation Mechanism

During training, the system follows these steps at regular intervals (every $N$ update steps):

1. The Training Monitor collects recent statistics and generates a prompt $P_t$.
2. The LLM-based Meta-Controller processes $P_t$ and outputs hyperparameter adjustment recommendations $\Delta H_t$.
3. The system applies the adjustments to obtain the new configuration $H_{t+1} = f(H_t, \Delta H_t)$.
4. The base RL agent continues training with the updated hyperparameters.

The adjustment function $f$ applies constraints to ensure stability:

$$
f(H_t, \Delta H_t) = \text{clip}(H_t + \Delta H_t, H_{min}, H_{max})
$$

Additionally, we implement a safety mechanism that reverts changes if performance deteriorates significantly, defined by a threshold $\tau$:

$$
H_{t+1} = \begin{cases}
f(H_t, \Delta H_t) & \text{if } \Delta M_t > -\tau \\
H_t & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where $\Delta M_t$ is the change in a primary performance metric.

#### 2.3.3 Meta-Reinforcement Learning Formulation

We can formulate the hyperparameter adaptation problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP):

- **State**: The true state $s_t$ includes the agent's policy parameters, environment dynamics, and current learning progress.
- **Observation**: The LLM observes a partial representation of the state through the prompt $P_t$.
- **Action**: Hyperparameter adjustments $\Delta H_t$.
- **Reward**: Improvement in the base RL agent's performance.

This formulation allows us to conceptualize the LLM as implementing a meta-policy $\pi_{meta}(a|o)$ that aims to maximize the cumulative performance improvement of the base agent.
