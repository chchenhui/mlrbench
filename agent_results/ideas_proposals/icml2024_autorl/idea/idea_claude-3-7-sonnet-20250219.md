# Leveraging LLMs for Hyperparameter-Agnostic Reinforcement Learning

## Motivation
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously sensitive to hyperparameter choices, creating a significant barrier to adoption in real-world applications. Current implementations often require extensive tuning by experts, limiting accessibility and reproducibility. As automated RL gains momentum, there's a critical need for algorithms that perform robustly across tasks without manual hyperparameter optimization. This research aims to democratize RL by removing this dependency, allowing practitioners to deploy RL solutions without specialized expertise in algorithm tuning.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to create hyperparameter-agnostic RL algorithms. The system operates in two phases: First, the LLM analyzes the structure of the environment and task description to predict optimal hyperparameter configurations based on similar historical problems. Second, it implements an adaptive tuning mechanism during training, where the LLM continuously observes learning progress and dynamically adjusts hyperparameters based on performance patterns. The framework maintains a memory of successful configurations across environments with transferable characteristics, building a knowledge base for future tasks. This approach combines the pattern recognition capabilities of LLMs with adaptive RL optimization, potentially enabling "plug-and-play" reinforcement learning that automatically configures itself to new tasks without expert intervention.
