   - **Authors**: Aditya Mohan, Carolin Benjamins, Konrad Wienecke, Alexander Dockhorn, Marius Lindauer
   - **Summary**: This paper investigates the dynamics of hyperparameter landscapes in reinforcement learning (RL) over time. The authors analyze how hyperparameter configurations affect performance across different RL algorithms and environments, providing empirical evidence that these landscapes vary significantly during training. This supports the need for dynamic hyperparameter adjustment to enhance RL performance.

   - **Authors**: Theresa Eimer, Marius Lindauer, Roberta Raileanu
   - **Summary**: The authors highlight the significant impact of hyperparameter choices on RL agent performance and sample efficiency.

   - **Authors**: Ziyu Wan, Yunxiang Li, Yan Song, Hanjing Wang, Linyi Yang, Mark Schmidt, Jun Wang, Weinan Zhang, Shuyue Hu, Ying Wen
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces ReMA, a framework that employs multi-agent reinforcement learning to develop meta-thinking capabilities in large language models (LLMs). By decoupling the reasoning process into hierarchical agents—one for strategic oversight and another for detailed execution—ReMA enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks.

**Key Challenges**:

1. **Dynamic Hyperparameter Landscapes**: Hyperparameter landscapes in RL are not static; they evolve during training, making it challenging to identify optimal configurations that remain effective throughout the learning process.

2. **Computational Overhead of Hyperparameter Optimization**: Comprehensive hyperparameter tuning can be computationally expensive, especially when employing broad search spaces and multiple evaluation runs, limiting accessibility for researchers with limited resources.

3. **Generalization Across Diverse Environments**: Developing hyperparameter optimization methods that generalize well across various RL algorithms and environments remains a significant challenge, as performance can be highly context-dependent.

4. **Integration of LLMs in RL**: Effectively incorporating large language models into RL frameworks for tasks like dynamic hyperparameter adjustment requires addressing issues related to model interpretability, scalability, and the alignment of objectives between the LLM and the RL agent.

5. **Evaluation and Benchmarking**: Establishing standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics for AutoRL approaches is crucial for fair comparison and progress in the field, yet developing such benchmarks that accurately reflect real-world scenarios is complex.
