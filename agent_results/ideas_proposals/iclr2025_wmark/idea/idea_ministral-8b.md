### Title: "Generative AI Watermarking through Adversarial Neural Networks"

### Motivation:
As generative AI becomes more prevalent, ensuring the authenticity and traceability of generated content is paramount. Traditional watermarking methods are often ineffective against advanced AI techniques. This research aims to develop a robust watermarking system that can withstand adversarial attacks and provide a reliable means of identifying and verifying the origin of AI-generated content.

### Main Idea:
This research proposes the development of an adversarial neural network-based watermarking system for generative AI. The system will leverage the strengths of adversarial learning to embed watermarks that are resilient against various attack vectors, including adversarial perturbations and model inversion attacks. The methodology involves training a generator network to embed watermarks into the generated content and a discriminator network to detect these watermarks. The networks will be trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to ensure robustness against both known and unknown attacks. The expected outcomes include a watermarking system that can effectively embed and detect watermarks in high-dimensional data, such as images and text, and a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark the system's performance against existing methods. The potential impact of this research is significant, as it will contribute to the development of secure and trustworthy generative AI systems, benefiting industries ranging from media and entertainment to cybersecurity and intellectual property protection.
