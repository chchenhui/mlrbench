**Key Challenges:**

1. **Modality Heterogeneity**: Aligning representations across different modalities is challenging due to inherent differences in data structures and distributions, making it difficult to establish a common latent space.

2. **Computational Complexity**: Optimal transport methods, while effective, can be computationally intensive, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets or long sequences, limiting their practical applicability.

3. **Semantic Consistency**: Ensuring that aligned representations preserve semantic relationships across modalities is crucial; misalignment can lead to degraded performance in downstream tasks.

4. **Identifiability and Invertibility**: Establishing mappings that are both identifiable and invertible is essential to maintain individual model functionality post-alignment, yet achieving this remains a significant challenge.

5. **Data Pairing and Availability**: Effective cross-modal alignment often requires large amounts of paired data (e.g., image-text pairs), which may not always be readily available, hindering the training and evaluation of alignment methods.
