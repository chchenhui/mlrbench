# Title  
**Cross-Modality Representation Alignment via Optimal Transport for Seamless Model Merging**

---

# Introduction  
## Background  
Neural models across biological and artificial systems exhibit a striking phenomenon: similar representations emerge when exposed to shared stimuli, regardless of modality or training paradigm. This convergence has spurred interest in unifying representations across models to enable reusable, interoperable AI systems. However, when merging pre-trained models from distinct modalities (e.g., vision and language), latent space mismatches create a critical bottleneck. While recent approaches leverage optimal transport (OT) to align representations, they often require full retraining, neglect invertibility guarantees, or fail to preserve individual model functionality. This proposal addresses these gaps by introducing a novel OT-based framework that aligns latent spaces while enabling seamless merging without retraining.

## Research Objectives  
1. **Align Representations**: Minimize the Wasserstein distance between latent distributions of cross-modal models (e.g., image and text encoders) using an invertible OT-based mapping.  
2. **Seamless Merging**: Enable joint task execution (e.g., visual question answering) by fusing aligned representations via adaptive cross-attention layers, obviating end-to-end retraining.  
3. **Preserve Functionality**: Ensure the merged model retains individual modalities’ performance on their original tasks through invertible transformations.  
4. **Theoretical Insights**: Investigate conditions under which OT alignment preserves semantic invariances and identifiability.  

## Significance  
This work bridges the modality gap, enabling:  
- **Efficient Knowledge Transfer**: Reduce redundant training in multimodal systems.  
- **Cost Savings**: Merge pre-trained models via alignment instead of joint retraining.  
- **Cross-Domain Applications**: Advance robotics, embodied AI, and low-resource multimodal tasks.  
By grounding alignment in OT theory, we address critical challenges like modality heterogeneity and identifiability, contributing to both AI and neuroscience research on universal representation patterns.

# Methodology  
## Data Collection  
**Datasets**:  
1. **CLIP-Aligned Data**: Paired image-text samples (e.g., LAION-400M curated subsets) for training alignment.  
2. **Multimodal QA Tasks**: ScienceQA, VQA for evaluating downstream fusion performance.  
3. **Unpaired Modality Data**: ImageNet, Wikipedia sentences for testing cross-modal retrieval.  

**Preprocessing**:  
- Extract intermediate activations $ \mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times d_x} $, $ \mathbf{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times d_y} $ from pre-trained vision (ResNet-50) and language (BERT) models for paired data.  
- Normalize activations to zero-mean and unit variance: $ \hat{\mathbf{X}} = \frac{\mathbf{X} - \mu_x}{\sigma_x} $, $ \hat{\mathbf{Y}} = \frac{\mathbf{Y} - \mu_y}{\sigma_y} $.  

## Optimal Transport Alignment  
**Problem Formulation**:  
Given paired features $ \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y} $, find a transport matrix $ \mathbf{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}_{\geq 0} $ mapping $ \mathbf{X} $ to $ \mathbf{Y} $ by solving the entropic-regularized OT problem:  
$$
\min_{\mathbf{T}} \langle \mathbf{T}, \mathbf{C} \rangle - \epsilon H(\mathbf{T}) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \mathbf{T} \mathbf{1} = \mathbf{a}, \, \mathbf{T}^\top \mathbf{1} = \mathbf{b},
$$
where $ \mathbf{C}_{ij} = \|\hat{\mathbf{x}}_i - \hat{\mathbf{y}}_j\|^2 $ is the pairwise cost matrix, $ H(\mathbf{T}) = -\sum_{i,j} \mathbf{T}_{ij}(\log \mathbf{T}_{ij} - 1) $ is entropy regularization, $ \epsilon > 0 $ controls smoothness, and $ \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} $ are empirical marginals.  

**Solution**: Use the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to iteratively update $ \mathbf{T} $:  
1. Initialize $ \mathbf{K} = e^{-\gamma \mathbf{C}} $ for $ \gamma = 1/\epsilon $.  
2. Iterate $ \mathbf{u}^{(k)} = \mathbf{a} / (\mathbf{Kv}^{(k-1)}) $, $ \mathbf{v}^{(k)} = \mathbf{b} / (\mathbf{K}^\top \mathbf{u}^{(k)}) $ until convergence.  
3. Compute $ \mathbf{T} = \text{diag}(\mathbf{u}) \mathbf{K} \text{diag}(\mathbf{v}) $.  

**Invertible Mapping**: To ensure invertibility, parameterize the transport plan as $ \mathbf{T} = \mathbf{P}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{P}^\top $, where $ \mathbf{P} $ is orthogonal (via singular value decomposition) and $ \mathbf{D} $ is diagonal. This guarantees bijectivity between $ \mathbf{X} $ and $ \mathbf{Y} $.  

## Fusion Architecture  
**Adaptive Cross-Attention**:  
After alignment, the vision and language models’ outputs are in a shared geometry. Introduce lightweight cross-attention modules:  
1. For query $ \mathbf{q}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_q} $, compute keys $ \mathbf{k}_j $ and values $ \mathbf{v}_j $ from the opposing modality.  
2. Attention weights: $ \alpha_{ij} = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{q}_i^\top \mathbf{k}_j / \sqrt{d_q}) $.  
3. Context vector: $ \mathbf{c}_i = \sum_j \alpha_{ij} \mathbf{v}_j $.  

The cross-attention layers are fixed post-alignment, avoiding end-to-end training.  

## Experimental Design  
**Baselines**:  
1. Naive merging (no alignment).  
2. MMD-based alignment (AlignMamba).  
3. Prototype-guided OT (DecAlign).  
4. Joint fine-tuning (gold standard).  

**Metrics**:  
1. **Alignment Quality**: $ \mathcal{W}_2^2(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y}) $, Procrustes error.  
2. **Functional Preservation**: Vision accuracy on ImageNet, text accuracy on GLUE.  
3. **Fusion Performance**: VQA accuracy, retrieval mAP.  
4. **Training Efficiency**: Compute time, FLOPs saved versus joint training.  

**Ablation Studies**:  
- Effect of $ \epsilon $ on alignment accuracy vs. computational cost.  
- Comparison of linear vs. orthogonal transformations for invertibility.  
- Impact of unpaired data on alignment via pseudo-pairing strategies.
