**Title:** Dynamic Adversarial Benchmarking for Generative AI via Continuous Reinforcement Learning  

**Motivation:** Static evaluation benchmarks for Generative AI (GenAI) safety quickly become obsolete as models evolve and adversaries develop new attack strategies. This gap leaves systems vulnerable to emerging risks, such as novel jailbreaks or misinformation tactics. Current red teaming methods lack adaptability, necessitating an automated, dynamic approach to continuously probe models against evolving threats.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework where adversarial agents autonomously generate and refine test cases to uncover vulnerabilities in GenAI systems. The framework employs a generator model, trained via RL, to create adversarial prompts (e.g., jailbreak attempts, privacy breaches) and a critic model to evaluate the target GenAIâ€™s responses. The generator optimizes for diversity and severity of failures, while integrating real-time updates from a curated database of emerging attack patterns and safety research. By simulating a perpetual "arms race" between attacker (generator) and defender (GenAI), the system dynamically adapts benchmarks to reflect cutting-edge threats.  

**Expected Outcomes & Impact:** The framework will produce a continuously evolving benchmark suite, enabling proactive risk mitigation. It addresses limitations of static evaluations and accelerates the discovery of novel vulnerabilities. If successful, this approach could become a foundational tool for AI safety, ensuring models remain robust against adversarial innovation.
