Title  
Adversarial Co-Learning: A Continuous Integration Framework for Red Teaming and Defense in Generative AI  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Generative AI models—especially large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image systems—have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a spectrum of tasks, from creative content generation to question answering. As these models grow in complexity and ubiquity, however, they also expose novel safety, security, and trustworthiness challenges: disallowed content generation, privacy leaks, copyright violations, and emergent biases. To uncover such vulnerabilities, practitioners employ red teaming—an adversarial process that probes model weaknesses by crafting malicious or out-of-distribution inputs. Recent efforts (e.g., Purple-teaming LLMs with Adversarial Defender Training [Zhou et al., 2024], Automated Red Teaming with GOAT [Pavlova et al., 2024], and Adversarial Nibbler [Quaye et al., 2024]) have yielded valuable frameworks for attack and defense. Yet these methods typically treat red teaming as a discrete audit before or after model release, resulting in delayed mitigations, recurring vulnerabilities, and a failure to capture rapidly evolving adversarial techniques.  

Research Objectives  
We propose Adversarial Co-Learning (ACL), a formal framework that tightly integrates red teaming into every stage of model development—creating a continuous feedback loop in which adversarial discoveries immediately inform training updates. Our objectives are:  
•   Design a dual-objective optimization that jointly maximizes task performance and minimizes adversarial vulnerability.  
•   Develop an adaptive reward mechanism to prioritize high-risk vulnerabilities, a vulnerability categorization system to map attacks to model components, and a retention mechanism to prevent regression on past fixes.  
•   Empirically validate ACL on state-of-the-art generative models, quantifying robustness gains, task performance trade-offs, and retention efficacy.  
•   Demonstrate how ACL can support safety guarantees and certification by producing an auditable robustness trail.  

Significance  
ACL addresses key challenges identified in the literature: the disconnection between red teaming and development cycles, the need for dynamic defenses against evolving adversaries, the trade-off between safety and performance, and regression of previously resolved issues. By embedding adversarial discovery in training loops, ACL transforms red teaming from a “security theater” into a driver of continuous model hardening—essential for real-world deployment where threat landscapes shift daily.  

2. Methodology  
Overview  
We formalize ACL as an interactive optimization between a model developer (the “blue team”) with parameters $\theta$ and a red team adversary that generates probe inputs in real time. Training proceeds in rounds, each consisting of adversarial data collection, vulnerability categorization, adaptive weighting, model update, and retention sampling.  

2.1 Data Collection and Adversarial Example Generation  
We draw from two sources of adversarial inputs:  
1.   Automated adversaries (e.g., GOAT-style agents) that use black-box probing and prompt templates to generate failure modes.  
2.   Human or crowd-sourced red teams (e.g., Adversarial Nibbler) to surface long-tail and context-specific attacks.  

At iteration $t$, let $\mathcal{S}=\{(x_i,y_i)\}$ be the standard training set (e.g., token sequences with next-token labels or image-caption pairs), and let $\mathcal{A}_t=\{x'_j\}$ be the newly generated adversarial batch. We store each $(x'_j,\tau_j)$ in a vulnerability buffer $\mathcal{B}$, where $\tau_j$ encodes its taxonomy label (e.g., “jailbreak,” “privacy leak,” “bias”).  

2.2 Dual-Objective Loss Function  
We define three loss components:  
•   Task loss:  
    $$  
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim \mathcal{S}}\bigl[\ell\bigl(f_\theta(x),\,y\bigr)\bigr],  
    $$  
    where $\ell$ is cross-entropy for language modeling or MSE for image generation.  
•   Adversarial loss:  
    $$  
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{x'\sim \mathcal{A}_t}\bigl[\mathrm{Vuln}\bigl(f_\theta(x')\bigr)\bigr],  
    $$  
    where $\mathrm{Vuln}(\cdot)$ returns 1 if the model fails safety checks (e.g., generates disallowed content), and 0 otherwise.  
•   Retention loss:  
    $$  
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{ret}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(x_r,\tau)\sim \mathcal{B}_{\text{old}}}\bigl[\mathrm{Vuln}(f_\theta(x_r))\bigr],  
    $$  
    where $\mathcal{B}_{\text{old}}$ is a sampled subset of historical adversarial examples.  

The total loss combines these terms with weighting coefficients:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}}(\theta) \;=\; \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(\theta) \;+\; \lambda_{\text{adv}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}}(\theta)\;+\;\lambda_{\text{ret}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{ret}}(\theta).  
$$  

2.3 Adaptive Reward Mechanism  
To prioritize high-risk vulnerabilities, we maintain a risk score $r_j$ for each adversarial example $x'_j$. After each training epoch, we update $r_j$ based on model responses:  
$$  
r_j \;\leftarrow\; \alpha\,r_j \;+\;(1-\alpha)\,\mathrm{Severity}\bigl(f_\theta(x'_j)\bigr),  
$$  
where $\alpha\in[0,1]$ is a momentum term and $\mathrm{Severity}(\cdot)\in[0,1]$ quantifies the extent of the breach (e.g., degree of toxicity, level of privacy breach). In subsequent iterations, we sample $\mathcal{A}_t$ with probability proportional to $r_j$, thus focusing training on the riskiest attacks.  

2.4 Vulnerability Categorization System  
Each adversarial input is tagged with a taxonomy label $\tau_j \in \{\text{jailbreak},\text{privacy},\text{bias},\ldots\}$. We maintain separate risk pools $\mathcal{B}_\tau$ for each category. This allows targeted mitigation: for categories with high residual risk, we increase $\lambda_{\text{adv}}^\tau$ for the corresponding group in the loss:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}}(\theta) = \sum_{\tau}\lambda_{\text{adv}}^\tau\,\mathbb{E}_{x'\sim \mathcal{A}_t^\tau}[\mathrm{Vuln}(f_\theta(x'))].  
$$  

2.5 Retention Mechanism  
To prevent catastrophic forgetting of earlier fixes, we cap the buffer size $|\mathcal{B}|=K$ and retain a uniform or risk-weighted sample $\mathcal{B}_{\text{old}}$ at each iteration. This replay ensures that previously mitigated vulnerabilities stay represented in training.  

2.6 Training Algorithm  
Algorithm 1 summarizes the ACL loop.  

Algorithm 1: Adversarial Co-Learning (ACL)  
Input: Standard dataset $\mathcal{S}$, initial model $f_{\theta_0}$, adversary $\mathcal{R}$, buffer size $K$, hyper-parameters $\lambda_{\text{adv}}$, $\lambda_{\text{ret}}$, $\alpha$  
Output: Robust model $f_{\theta_T}$  

for $t=1\ldots T$ do  
    1. Adversarial example generation:  
       $\mathcal{A}_t \leftarrow \mathcal{R}(f_{\theta_{t-1}})$  
    2. Update buffer $\mathcal{B}\leftarrow$ top $K$ examples by risk score.  
    3. Sample minibatches $(x,y)\sim\mathcal{S}$, $x'\sim\mathcal{A}_t$, $(x_r,\tau)\sim\mathcal{B}_{\text{old}}$.  
    4. Compute total loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}}$ (with category weights).  
    5. $\theta_t \leftarrow \theta_{t-1} - \eta\,\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}}(\theta_{t-1})$.  
    6. Update risk scores $r_j$ for all $x'_j\in \mathcal{A}_t$ via severity-based momentum.  
end for  

2.7 Experimental Design and Evaluation Metrics  
We will validate ACL on two state-of-the-art generative models: a 7B-parameter open-source LLM (e.g., LLaMA-2 7B) and a baseline text-to-image model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).  

Datasets:  
•   Standard tasks: Wikitext, GLUE, MS-COCO (for image captioning), and CC3M.  
•   Adversarial seeds: prompts from Silver Bullet or Security Theater [Feffer et al., 2024] and GOAT, plus crowd-sourced inputs from an online red teaming challenge (500 participants).  

Baselines:  
•   Standard fine-tuning without adversarial data.  
•   Purple-teaming (self-play PAD pipeline) [Zhou et al., 2024].  
•   GOAT-only defense (automated red teaming with post hoc finetuning).  

Metrics:  
1.   Task performance: perplexity, accuracy on GLUE, BLEU for captioning, FID for image quality.  
2.   Robustness: attack success rate (ASR) on held-out adversarial sets; Attack Success Rate vs. Task Accuracy curves; Area Under Robustness–Accuracy Curve (AURAC).  
3.   Retention: forgetting index, defined as the increase in ASR on older vulnerabilities after $n$ updates.  
4.   Severity reduction: average severity score drop across categories.  
5.   Human evaluation: safety score (% safe responses), alignment with ethical guidelines (via crowd workers).  
6.   Training overhead: additional compute and wall-clock time compared to baselines.  

Ablation Studies:  
•   Remove adaptive reward (uniform sampling).  
•   Remove categorization (single $\lambda_{\text{adv}}$).  
•   Remove retention ($\lambda_{\text{ret}}=0$).  

Statistical Validation:  
We will use paired t-tests and bootstrapped confidence intervals to assess significance at $p<0.05$.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
3.1 Expected Outcomes  
•   Demonstration that ACL yields significant reductions in ASR (e.g., ≥30% relative to PAD and GOAT baselines) with minimal (<2%) degradation in standard task metrics.  
•   Empirical evidence that adaptive sampling accelerates vulnerability mitigation, reducing regression by ≥50% compared to naive replay.  
•   Clear mapping between vulnerability categories and model components, enabling targeted defenses with quantifiable risk reduction per category.  
•   A reproducible codebase and benchmark suite for continuous red-team-driven training, fostering community adoption.  

3.2 Impact  
Research Impact: ACL advances the state of adversarial robustness for generative models by (1) formalizing a continuous co-learning loop, (2) introducing principled mechanisms for adaptive prioritization and regression prevention, and (3) providing a pathway toward measurable safety guarantees.  

Practical Impact: Integration of ACL in industrial ML pipelines will enable rapid iteration on model releases, shortening vulnerability mitigation cycles and reducing reliance on large-scale post-hoc audits. The risk-scoring and documentation generated at each iteration support regulatory compliance and safety certification efforts.  

Societal Impact: By lowering the barrier to robust, continuously hardened generative AI, ACL contributes to safer deployments in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal assistance—thereby enhancing public trust and mitigating harms from misinformation, bias, and content misuse.  

4. Conclusion  
This proposal outlines Adversarial Co-Learning (ACL), a unified framework that transforms red teaming from a standalone evaluation into an integral component of model training. By jointly optimizing for task performance and adversarial robustness, and by introducing adaptive, category-aware, and retention-based mechanisms, ACL promises faster vulnerability resolution, reduced regression, and a documented robustness trail. Our planned experiments on LLMs and text-to-image models will quantify these benefits and establish best practices for continuous safety-driven generative AI development.
