**Title:** Geometry-Aware Regularization for Enhancing Latent Space Structure in Deep Generative Models  

**Motivation:** Deep generative models (DGMs) often exhibit latent spaces with complex, poorly understood geometries, leading to issues like mode collapse, unstable training, or low sample diversity. A systematic understanding of latent space geometry is critical to improving model robustness, interpretability, and generation quality, particularly for scientific applications where structured data (e.g., molecular graphs) demand precise latent representations.  

**Main Idea:** This work proposes a framework to analyze and regularize the geometry of latent spaces in DGMs using tools from differential geometry and topology. We will (1) characterize the Riemannian structure of latent manifolds via curvature analysis and topological data analysis (TDA), (2) design a regularization loss that penalizes undesirable geometric properties (e.g., high curvature spikes, disconnected components), and (3) integrate this into training objectives for VAEs and diffusion models. The approach will be validated on image and scientific datasets (e.g., molecular graphs), measuring improvements in sample quality, interpolation smoothness, and downstream task performance. Expected outcomes include more interpretable latent spaces, improved model stability, and higher-fidelity generation for structured data, advancing DGMs in AI4Science applications.
