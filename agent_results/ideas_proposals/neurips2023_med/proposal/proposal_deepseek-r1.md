**Research Proposal: Bayesian-Informed Self-Supervised Learning for Robust and Interpretable Clinical Machine Learning in Medical Imaging**  

---

### **1. Introduction**  
**Background**  
Medical imaging is a cornerstone of modern healthcare, but its reliance on human interpretation introduces challenges such as inter-observer variability and diagnostic fatigue. While machine learning (ML) has shown promise in automating image analysis, clinical deployment remains fraught with barriers: limited data availability, adversarial vulnerability, and the "black-box" nature of models erode trust. Existing solutions often prioritize accuracy over robustness or fail to align interpretability with clinician workflows, especially under noise and domain shifts. Recent advances in *self-supervised learning (SSL)* and *Bayesian neural networks (BNNs)* offer pathways to address these issues, but their integration remains underexplored in medical contexts.  

**Research Objectives**  
This work aims to:  
1. Develop a hybrid SSL-BNN framework for medical imaging that improves robustness against data scarcity, adversarial perturbations, and distributional shifts.  
2. Quantify and calibrate predictive uncertainty to enhance clinical decision-making transparency.  
3. Generate explainable visualizations aligned with domain knowledge and uncertainty estimates to foster clinician trust.  

**Significance**  
By bridging SSL’s data efficiency with BNN’s uncertainty quantification and interpretability mechanisms, this framework addresses the crisis of reliability in medical ML. It directly responds to the workshop’s emphasis on real-world applicability, offering novel solutions for clinical collaboration and resource-constrained settings.

### **2. Methodology**  
**Research Design**  
The framework combines three pillars: (1) self-supervised pre-training with anatomical augmentations, (2) Bayesian fine-tuning for uncertainty-aware prediction, and (3) attention-guided interpretability calibrated to uncertainty.  

#### **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
- **Datasets**:  
  - **MRI**: BraTS 2023 (brain tumors), MS-SEG 2025 (multiple sclerosis lesions).  
  - **X-ray**: CheXpert (chest radiographs with pathology labels).  
- **Augmentations**: Anatomically valid transformations (e.g., rigid deformations, contrast adjustments) to enforce domain-invariant feature learning. Adversarial perturbations (PGD attacks) will simulate real-world noise.  

#### **Algorithmic Framework**  
1. **Self-Supervised Pre-training**:  
   - **Contrastive SSL**: Use a 3D SimCLR variant to learn invariant representations. For an input batch, generate pairs $(x_i, x_j)$ via augmentations and minimize:  
     $$
     \mathcal{L}_{cont} = -\log \frac{\exp(z_i \cdot z_j / \tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^{2N} \mathbb{1}_{k \neq i} \exp(z_i \cdot z_k / \tau)}
     $$  
     where $z_i, z_j$ are embeddings of augmented views and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.  

2. **Bayesian Fine-Tuning**:  
   - **Architecture**: Replace the SSL backbone’s final layer with a Bayesian layer using Monte Carlo dropout (MC-dropout, 20% rate during inference).  
   - **Loss Function**: Multi-task objective combining segmentation (Dice loss) and uncertainty calibration (KL divergence):  
     $$
     \mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{Dice} + \lambda \cdot KL(q(\mathbf{w}) || p(\mathbf{w}))
     $$  
     where $q(\mathbf{w})$ is the variational posterior and $p(\mathbf{w})$ is the prior.  

3. **Interpretability Module**:  
   - **Uncertainty-Aware Attention**: Integrate gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) with Bayesian uncertainty. For a sample $x$, compute attention maps $A(x)$ as:  
     $$
     A(x) = \text{ReLU}\left(\sum_{k} \alpha_k \cdot F^k(x)\right)
     $$  
     where $\alpha_k$ are gradients of the predictive entropy w.r.t. feature maps $F^k(x)$.  
   - **Clinical Alignment**: Validate attention maps against radiologist annotations using the *pointing game* metric (hit rate of highlighted regions).  

#### **Experimental Validation**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against:  
  - Standard CNNs (ResNet-50, U-Net).  
  - SSL-only models (SimCLR, BYOL).  
  - BNNs (Bayesian U-Net, MC-dropout ResNet).  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Performance**: Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), AUC-ROC.  
  - **Robustness**: Adversarial success rate (ASR), AUC drop under PGD/$L_2$ attacks.  
  - **Uncertainty**: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier score.  
  - **Interpretability**: Dice between attention maps and clinician annotations, clinician survey scores (5-point Likert scale).  
- **Tasks**:  
  - *Task 1*: Multi-class tumor segmentation on BraTS.  
  - *Task 2*: Pneumonia detection on CheXpert with reliability scoring.

### **3. Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Robustness**: A 15% improvement in AUC under adversarial attacks compared to SSL and BNN baselines.  
2. **Calibration**: ECE reduction by 30% through Bayesian loss integration.  
3. **Interpretability**: 20% higher attention map accuracy versus non-Bayesian Grad-CAM.  
4. **Generalization**: Consistent performance (±5% DSC variance) across MRI/X-ray modalities and simulated scanner shifts.  

**Impact**  
This work will advance the deployment of trustworthy AI in healthcare by:  
- Providing tools to quantify and communicate model confidence, enabling safer human-AI collaboration.  
- Reducing reliance on large, curated datasets through SSL, lowering economic barriers for low-resource clinics.  
- Demonstrating the synergy between robustness and interpretability—a critical step toward regulatory approval.  

By addressing the workshop’s themes of data efficiency and clinical applicability, this framework sets a foundation for future research into reliable, human-centered medical ML.
