**Key Challenges:**

1. **Data Scarcity and Quality**: Medical imaging datasets are often limited in size and may contain noise or inconsistencies, making it challenging to train robust machine learning models.

2. **Adversarial Robustness**: Ensuring that models are resilient to adversarial attacks is critical for reliable deployment in clinical settings.

3. **Interpretability**: Developing models that provide transparent and clinically meaningful explanations is essential for gaining trust from healthcare professionals.

4. **Generalizability**: Models must perform well across diverse imaging systems and patient populations, requiring strategies to handle domain shifts effectively.

5. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Accurately estimating predictive uncertainty is vital for assessing model confidence and guiding clinical decision-making.
