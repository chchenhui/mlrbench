# **Research Proposal**

## **1. Title:** Personalized UI Generation via Reinforcement Learning from Implicit and Explicit User Feedback

## **2. Introduction**

### **2.1 Background**
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are increasingly intertwined fields, with AI driving novel interaction paradigms and HCI providing critical grounding in user needs and evaluation methodologies. A key area at this intersection is the automated generation and adaptation of user interfaces (UIs). As software applications become more complex and diverse, the need for UIs that are not only functional but also intuitive, efficient, and tailored to individual users becomes paramount. Early UI generation approaches often relied on predefined templates or rule-based systems, resulting in static and generic interfaces. While recent advancements in deep learning have enabled more sophisticated UI generation (e.g., translating mockups to code, generating layouts from descriptions), a significant gap remains: the lack of deep personalization and continuous adaptation based on user-specific interaction patterns and preferences.

Current AI-powered UI generation systems often produce a "one-size-fits-all" solution, failing to account for the heterogeneity of users regarding their skills, working styles, cognitive load tolerance, accessibility requirements, and evolving preferences. This oversight limits the potential for truly seamless and satisfying human-computer interaction. Interfaces might be usable in general but suboptimal for specific individuals or groups, potentially leading to decreased productivity, frustration, and abandonment. Furthermore, most existing systems lack robust mechanisms for incorporating user feedback dynamically. Users interact with interfaces constantly, generating rich data streams (clicks, navigation paths, time spent, errors) that signal their implicit preferences and difficulties. Explicit feedback mechanisms (ratings, comments, corrections) provide direct insights. Harnessing this continuous flow of multi-modal feedback is crucial for creating UIs that learn, evolve, and truly adapt to their users over time.

### **2.2 Literature Review Summary and Research Gap**
Significant research has explored UI adaptation using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Notably, Gaspar-Figueiredo et al. (2023, 2024, 2025) have developed RL frameworks focusing on *adapting* existing UIs to improve user experience (UX), leveraging predictive HCI models and incorporating human feedback (including physiological data and explicit ratings) to personalize the RL agent's policy for individual users. Their work demonstrates the potential of RL and human feedback for optimizing UI *adaptations*. The broader concept of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), primarily popularized in Natural Language Processing (NLP), uses human rankings or ratings to guide agent behavior (Various, 2025), offering valuable techniques for integrating subjective human judgment into the learning loop.

However, the existing literature, particularly the work highlighted, primarily focuses on *adapting* pre-existing interfaces rather than *generating* personalized interfaces dynamically based on evolving user preferences learned over extended interactions. While adaptation modifies existing structures, our proposed work aims to leverage user feedback to influence the *generative process itself*, potentially leading to more fundamentally personalized designs rather than just incremental adjustments. Furthermore, efficiently integrating and balancing *both* implicit interaction signals (often noisy and requiring interpretation) and direct explicit feedback within a generative RL framework remains an open challenge, as noted in the literature review's key challenges (Integration of Implicit and Explicit Feedback, Personalization Accuracy). Our research aims to bridge this gap by developing a novel framework specifically for *adaptive UI generation*, integrating a dual-feedback loop (implicit and explicit) into an RL-driven generative model.

### **2.3 Research Objectives**
This research aims to develop and evaluate a novel framework for adaptive UI generation that learns and evolves based on continuous user feedback. The specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Preference Learning Module:** Design and implement a module capable of capturing and modeling user preferences from both implicit interaction data (e.g., task completion time, error rates, navigation efficiency, dwell time) and explicit user feedback (e.g., ratings, UI element highlighting, direct correction suggestions).
2.  **Integrate Preference Learning with a Generative Model:** Couple the preference module with a UI generative model (e.g., based on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Transformers) such that learned preferences guide the generation process towards layouts and component choices favored by the user.
3.  **Implement an RL Framework for Adaptive Generation:** Formulate the adaptive UI generation problem as an RL task where the agent learns a policy to generate UIs that maximize a reward signal derived from the learned user preferences and task effectiveness. The RL agent must balance exploiting known preferences and exploring novel UI designs.
4.  **Design and Implement Explicit Feedback Mechanisms:** Develop intuitive user-facing mechanisms for providing explicit feedback on generated UIs (e.g., rating systems, element-specific feedback tools) that integrate seamlessly with the RL framework.
5.  **Evaluate the Framework through User Studies:** Conduct comprehensive user studies to evaluate the effectiveness, usability, and perceived personalization of the generated UIs compared to baseline static generation methods and potentially adaptive-only approaches. Assess the impact on user performance and satisfaction.

### **2.4 Significance**
This research holds significant potential for advancing both AI and HCI.
*   **For AI:** It pushes the boundaries of RLHF by applying it to the complex, structured domain of UI generation, requiring novel approaches for state representation, action spaces (modifying generative parameters), and reward modeling that integrates diverse, continuous feedback streams (implicit interaction + explicit ratings). It addresses the challenge of personalization in generative models.
*   **For HCI:** It offers a path towards truly user-centered adaptive systems that move beyond static designs. By learning individual preferences, the framework can generate interfaces that are potentially more intuitive, efficient, accessible, and satisfying, leading to improved usability and user experience across various applications.
*   **Practical Applications:** Successful outcomes could inform the design of next-generation UI development tools, personalized software applications, accessibility tools that adapt interfaces to specific needs, and platforms where user engagement is critical.
*   **Addressing Challenges:** This work directly tackles key challenges identified in the literature, such as integrating diverse feedback types, achieving accurate personalization, and developing robust evaluation methods for adaptive systems.

This research aligns perfectly with the workshop themes, particularly focusing on "User interface modeling for understanding and generation," "Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)," "Personalizable and correctable machine learning models," "Novel human interactions with models," and "Human evaluation methods."

## **3. Methodology**

### **3.1 Overall Framework Architecture**
The proposed framework consists of four core components integrated into a closed loop:

1.  **UI Generative Model:** Responsible for generating candidate UI designs based on input specifications (e.g., task requirements, target platform) and a conditioning vector representing the current user preference state.
2.  **User Interaction Environment:** A simulated or real environment where the user interacts with the generated UI to perform specific tasks. This environment logs interaction data.
3.  **Preference Learning Module:** Collects and processes both implicit interaction data (from the environment) and explicit feedback (from the user) to update a user preference model.
4.  **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Observes the current state (including user preferences), selects actions to modify the generative model's conditioning or parameters for the next UI generation cycle, and receives rewards based on the Preference Learning Module's output.

*(Conceptual Diagram Description: A cycle showing: 1. RL Agent influences Generative Model -> 2. Generative Model produces UI -> 3. User interacts with UI in Environment -> 4. Environment sends Implicit Data to Preference Module, User provides Explicit Feedback to Preference Module -> 5. Preference Module updates Preference Model & calculates Reward -> 6. RL Agent receives State (including Preferences) and Reward, then takes Action)*

### **3.2 Data Collection**
*   **Implicit Data:** We will log user interactions within the environment. Key metrics include:
    *   Task completion time and success rate.
    *   Number and type of errors made.
    *   Navigation path efficiency (e.g., number of clicks/actions vs. optimal).
    *   Time spent interacting with specific UI elements or regions (dwell time).
    *   Frequency of use for optional UI features or shortcuts.
    *   Scrolling behavior, mouse movement patterns (potentially).
*   **Explicit Data:** We will develop simple UI widgets allowing users to provide feedback directly:
    *   Overall UI rating (e.g., 1-5 stars).
    *   Ability to highlight specific UI elements and provide positive/negative feedback or brief comments.
    *   Potential for comparative feedback (e.g., "Prefer Layout A over Layout B").
*   **Environment:** Initially, we may use a simulated environment with specific, well-defined tasks (e.g., form filling, data visualization dashboard interaction, e-commerce product browsing). Later stages will involve deployment in a more realistic web application prototype. User interaction data will be timestamped and associated with the specific UI version they interacted with.

### **3.3 Preference Learning Module**
This module translates raw feedback into a representation usable by the RL agent and for reward calculation.

*   **Implicit Feedback Processing:** Raw interaction logs will be processed to extract meaningful features (e.g., normalized task time, error rate per task, click entropy). Techniques like feature engineering combined with statistical modeling or potentially sequence modeling (e.g., LSTMs) could be used to capture temporal interaction patterns and infer implicit preferences or usability issues. For instance, consistently high error rates associated with a specific UI component might indicate a negative implicit preference.
*   **Explicit Feedback Processing:** Explicit ratings and comments will be directly incorporated. Numerical ratings can be used as strong signals. Text comments might require simple sentiment analysis or keyword extraction. Highlighted elements provide spatial context for feedback.
*   **Preference Model:** A unified preference model $P_\theta(u)$ will be maintained for each user $u$, parameterized by $\theta$. This model aims to predict user satisfaction or task effectiveness given a UI design. It will be updated based on both implicit ($D_{imp}$) and explicit ($D_{exp}$) feedback streams. The update mechanism could involve Bayesian updates, supervised learning on feedback data, or direct incorporation into the RL reward.
*   **Combined Signal:** The module will output a combined signal reflecting user preference, potentially used directly as part of the RL reward or to update the state representation. This requires careful weighting and normalization of implicit and explicit signals, potentially learned or tuned.

### **3.4 Generative Model**
We will explore sequence-based or graph-based models capable of generating structured UI representations.

*   **Representation:** UIs could be represented as a sequence of tokens in a Domain-Specific Language (DSL), a hierarchical structure (like a DOM tree), or a graph where nodes are components and edges represent layout relationships.
*   **Model Architecture:**
    *   **Transformer-based:** Models like GPT or BERT, adapted for UI generation, can capture long-range dependencies in layout and content. Conditioning ($c$) on task requirements and user preferences ($P_\theta(u)$) would guide the generation: $p(UI | task, c)$.
    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** Useful for learning a latent space ($z$) of UI designs. The RL agent could operate in this latent space, or the user preference vector could directly condition the decoder: $p(UI | z, c)$.
*   **Conditioning:** The user preference model $P_\theta(u)$ output will be encoded into a vector $c$ used to condition the generative model, biasing it towards generating UIs likely to align with the user's preferences.

### **3.5 Reinforcement Learning Agent**
The core of the adaptive generation process. We formulate this as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), as the true user preference state is not fully observable.

*   **State Space ($S$):** The state $s_t$ at time step $t$ includes:
    *   Current UI representation (or its salient features).
    *   Task description/context.
    *   Current estimate of user preferences (output of Preference Learning Module, $P_\theta(u)$).
    *   History of recent interactions or feedback.
    *   $s_t = f(UI_t, Task, P_\theta(u)_t, History_t)$
*   **Action Space ($A$):** The actions $a_t$ manipulate the input to the generative model for the *next* generation cycle ($UI_{t+1}$). This could involve:
    *   Modifying the conditioning vector $c$.
    *   Selecting high-level layout templates or component palettes.
    *   Adjusting hyperparameters of the generation process (e.g., diversity vs. fidelity).
    *   For latent space models (VAEs), actions could perturb the latent vector $z$.
*   **Reward Function ($R$):** The reward $r_t$ signals the quality of the generated UI ($UI_t$) based on interaction with it. It combines implicit and explicit feedback signals, aiming to reflect user satisfaction and task efficiency. A potential formulation:
    $$ R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) = w_{eff} R_{eff}(D_{imp}) + w_{pref} R_{pref}(D_{exp}, D_{imp}) - w_{cost} C(UI_t) $$
    Where:
    *   $R_{eff}$ measures task effectiveness derived from implicit data (e.g., inverse of normalized completion time + success bonus - error penalty).
    *   $R_{pref}$ measures alignment with user preferences derived from explicit feedback (e.g., ratings) and potentially inferred from implicit signals (e.g., positive score for frequently used optional elements).
    *   $C(UI_t)$ is an optional complexity or change penalty to encourage stability if desired.
    *   $w_{eff}, w_{pref}, w_{cost}$ are weighting factors, potentially adaptable. The Preference Learning Module provides the inputs $D_{imp}, D_{exp}$ needed to compute this reward after user interaction. Credit assignment (linking delayed feedback to the generating action) will be handled by the RL algorithm's value function updates.
*   **Policy ($\pi$):** The agent learns a policy $\pi(a_t | s_t)$ that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted reward $E[\sum_{k=t}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_k]$. Given the potentially large state space and need for exploration, we will likely use policy gradient methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), potentially combined with value function approximation using deep neural networks. Exploration strategies (e.g., epsilon-greedy in action space or parameter space noise) will be crucial for discovering novel, potentially better UI designs. Training will likely occur offline using batches of collected user interaction data, or potentially online in a simulated environment.

### **3.6 Experimental Design**

*   **Tasks:** Define 2-3 representative UI generation/interaction tasks. Examples:
    1.  Designing a personalized dashboard for viewing specific data.
    2.  Configuring settings in a complex application.
    3.  Creating a user profile form with varying fields based on user type.
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **Static Generator:** A non-adaptive generative model producing a single "generic" UI for the task.
    2.  **Rule-based Adaptation:** A system using simple heuristics (e.g., hiding unused elements) for adaptation, but without deep preference learning.
    3.  (Optional/Advanced) **Adaptation-Only RL:** An implementation based on Gaspar-Figueiredo's approach, adapting a fixed initial UI using RL and feedback, to compare adaptation vs. adaptive generation.
*   **User Study:**
    *   **Design:** A within-subjects design where each participant interacts with the different systems (our proposed adaptive generator, baselines) across the defined tasks (counterbalanced order).
    *   **Participants:** Recruit 20-30 participants representative of potential end-users. Screen for basic computer literacy. Consider diversity in user needs if possible (e.g., varying levels of expertise). IRB approval will be obtained.
    *   **Procedure:** Participants will perform the defined tasks using each system. They will be instructed on how to use the explicit feedback mechanisms. Interaction data will be logged automatically. After each task/system, questionnaires will capture perceived usability, satisfaction, and personalization. A final comparative questionnaire and semi-structured interview will gather qualitative insights.
    *   **Duration:** Each participant session might last 60-90 minutes.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    1.  **Quantitative Performance:** Task completion time, task success rate, error rate, interaction efficiency (e.g., clicks/actions). Compare metrics over time (within the adaptive system) and across systems.
    2.  **Qualitative User Experience:** System Usability Scale (SUS), NASA-TLX (Task Load Index), user satisfaction questionnaires (e.g., Likert scales on personalization, intuitiveness, aesthetics), qualitative feedback from interviews.
    3.  **Preference Learning Accuracy:** (Offline evaluation) Assess how well the preference model predicts user ratings or identifies problematic UI elements based on historical data.
    4.  **Adaptation Quality & Speed:** Measure how quickly the adaptive system converges towards improved performance/satisfaction for a user, and the magnitude of the improvement. Compare generated UIs against user feedback trends.
    5.  **Diversity of Generation:** Analyze the range of UIs generated for different users or for the same user over time to assess exploration capabilities.
