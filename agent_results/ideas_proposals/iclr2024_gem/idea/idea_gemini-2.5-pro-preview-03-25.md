**Title:** Closed-Loop Optimization of Protein Function via Adaptive Generative Design and Experimentation

**Motivation:** Traditional protein engineering relies on costly and time-consuming screening of large, often randomly generated libraries. Generative models can propose promising candidates, but bridging the gap between *in silico* design and *in vitro* validation for iterative optimization remains a key bottleneck for efficient biomolecular design.

**Main Idea:** We propose an active learning framework integrating generative models with high-throughput wet-lab experiments. A generative model (e.g., a conditional VAE or diffusion model) initially proposes diverse protein variants targeting a desired function (e.g., enzyme catalysis, binding affinity). These variants are synthesized and experimentally assayed. The results feed into a guiding mechanism (e.g., Bayesian optimization or reinforcement learning) that updates the generative model or its sampling strategy to focus on more promising regions of the sequence/structure space in the next design-build-test cycle. Expected outcome: Accelerated discovery of high-performing proteins with fewer experimental iterations compared to traditional or purely computational approaches. Potential Impact: Significantly streamline the development pipeline for novel enzymes, antibodies, and other functional proteins.
