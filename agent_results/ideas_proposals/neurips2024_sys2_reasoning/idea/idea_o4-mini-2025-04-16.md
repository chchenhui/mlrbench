Title: Adaptive Neural-Symbolic Reasoning Router (ANSRR)

Motivation:  
Current transformer models excel at pattern recognition but struggle with systematic, rule-based System-2 reasoning and compositional generalization. Purely scaling neural networks risks over-reliance on memorization and lacks explicit guarantees for safety-critical decisions. Integrating symbolic reasoning modules can enforce formal rules, but rigid pipelines lose flexibility. ANSRR targets this gap by dynamically routing subproblems between learned neural pathways and a lightweight symbolic engine, enabling robust, interpretable System-2 inference without sacrificing data-driven adaptability.

Main Idea:  
ANSRR introduces a trainable “reasoning router” atop a standard transformer. During generation, the router classifies each reasoning step (e.g., arithmetic subtask, logical inference, free-form text) and dispatches it either to (1) the neural decoder for flexible language-based reasoning, or (2) an embedded symbolic solver for exact, rule-based computations. The router is trained via reinforcement learning that rewards end-to-end task accuracy and symbolic tractability. We benchmark ANSRR on compositional math word problems and logical deduction datasets with strict contamination controls. Expected outcomes include improved systematic generalization, reduced hallucinations in multi-step reasoning, and interpretable decision logs for AI safety auditing. This hybrid approach fosters emergent System-2 capabilities while preserving the benefits of large-scale pretraining.
