1. **Title**: System 2 Attention (is something you might need too) (arXiv:2311.11829)
   - **Authors**: Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces System 2 Attention (S2A), a mechanism that enables large language models to reason in natural language and follow instructions to decide what to attend to. S2A regenerates the input context to include only relevant portions before attending to the regenerated context, improving factuality and objectivity in tasks such as question answering, math word problems, and long-form generation.
