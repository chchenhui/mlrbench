# Idea  
**1. Title:** **Transforming Graph Foundation Models via Hybrid GNN-Transformer Architectures for Multimodal Scientific Discovery**  

**2. Motivation:**  
Despite the successes of graph neural networks (GNNs), they face challenges competing with Transformer-based models in tasks where global attention dominates. Simultaneously, scientific domains like chemistry and biology increasingly require models that integrate graph-structured data (e.g., molecules, proteins) with natural language (e.g., experimental notes, hypotheses). Building hybrid architectures that unify the structural reasoning of GNNs with the flexible attention of Transformers could unlock new capabilities for graph foundation models, enabling cross-modal interaction and accelerating scientific discovery.  

**3. Main Idea:**  
We propose **HybridGNN-Transformers (HGT)**, a novel architecture combining GNNs for local graph structure with Transformer components for global context and cross-modal interactions. The model will:  
- Use GNNs to encode node/edge features while preserving spatial relationships.  
- Integrate Transformers to model long-range dependencies and enable multimodal fusion (e.g., graph + text).  
- Pre-train on large-scale scientific datasets (e.g., PubChem, protein-protein interactions) using multilingual and multi-task objectives, including graph generation, text-to-graph retrieval, and property prediction.  
- Deploy scalable training via subgraph sampling and efficient attention.  

**Outcomes**: Improved performance on molecular property prediction, protein design, and hypothesis-driven graph generation, outperforming standalone GNNs and Transformers. Impact includes enabling researchers to query graphs via language, automate hypothesis testing, and discover new compounds or biomarkers. This bridges structured data with human-centric interfaces, advancing graph learning as a universal tool in the foundation model era.
