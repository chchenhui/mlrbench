Okay, here is a detailed research proposal based on the provided task description, research idea, and literature review.

## 1. Title: GraphLang: A Unified and Interactive Foundation Model for Graph and Language Understanding

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Background
Graphs are ubiquitous structures, encoding complex relationships in domains ranging from knowledge representation (Knowledge Graphs - KGs), molecular chemistry, and social networks to biological pathways and scene understanding. The field of graph learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), has made significant strides in extracting patterns and making predictions from such data (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). However, interacting with and interpreting these complex graph structures often requires specialized expertise and tools, limiting their accessibility to a broader audience.

Concurrently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation models has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding, generation, and reasoning based on textual data (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023). LLMs offer an intuitive natural language interface, democratizing access to complex information retrieval and generation tasks. Yet, LLMs inherently struggle with the non-sequential, structured nature of graph data, often failing to capture intricate relational patterns or perform deep graph-based reasoning effectively (Zhao et al., 2023; Chai et al., 2023).

This presents a critical gap and opportunity: bridging the intuitive power of language interfaces with the rich relational information embedded in graphs. As highlighted by the GLFrontiers workshop call, developing foundation models for graphs and exploring language-based interaction with graph data are key frontiers. Recent works like GraphText (Zhao et al., 2023), GraphGPT (Tang et al., 2023), and GraphLLM (Chai et al., 2023) have begun exploring this intersection, primarily by translating graph information into text for LLM processing or integrating GNNs as separate modules. However, a truly *unified* foundation model capable of seamlessly processing and reasoning across both graph and language modalities, trained end-to-end on diverse graph-text data, remains an open challenge. Such a model could serve as a generic tool for understanding structured data, aligning perfectly with the goals of GLFrontiers.

### 2.2 Problem Statement
Current approaches for integrating graph learning and language models face several limitations:
1.  **Limited Bidirectionality:** Many methods focus on either representing graphs *as* text for LLM consumption (GraphText) or using graph features to *enhance* LLMs (GraphLLM, GraphGPT), rather than building a single model adept at bidirectional tasks (graph-to-text, text-to-graph operations).
2.  **Domain Specificity:** Existing foundation models often target specific graph types, like molecules (chemBERT, GraphMVP) or KGs, lacking the generality to handle diverse graph structures (e.g., KGs, molecules, scene graphs) within a single framework.
3.  **Interaction Constraints:** While some models allow querying, sophisticated interactions like language-driven graph editing, explanation generation grounded in graph structure, and complex multi-hop reasoning combining graph traversal and language understanding are underdeveloped.
4.  **Scalability and Heterogeneity:** Handling large-scale graphs and graphs with varying structural properties (e.g., heterophily, see Luan et al., 2022, 2024) within a language-integrated model presents significant architectural and training challenges.

### 2.3 Proposed Solution: GraphLang
We propose **GraphLang**, a novel foundation model designed to unify graph and language understanding. GraphLang will be based on a multi-modal Transformer architecture, capable of ingesting both graph structures and natural language text simultaneously. Its core innovation lies in its pretraining strategy on large-scale, diverse paired graph-text corpora spanning multiple domains (e.g., knowledge graphs with entity descriptions, molecules with chemical property texts, scene graphs with image captions detailing spatial relationships).

The pretraining phase will incorporate self-supervised objectives designed to foster deep alignment and understanding across modalities:
1.  **Masked Structure Reconstruction:** Masking and predicting nodes, edges, or their attributes within the graph context.
2.  **Masked Language Modeling:** Standard MLM objective on the text input.
3.  **Graph-to-Text Generation:** Generating textual descriptions or summaries corresponding to input graphs/subgraphs.
4.  **Contrastive Graph-Text Alignment:** Aligning the representation of a graph (or subgraph) with its corresponding textual description, pulling positive pairs closer and pushing negative pairs apart in the embedding space.

Following pretraining, GraphLang will undergo **instruction tuning** on a curated dataset of graph-related tasks expressed in natural language. This dataset will include examples of graph querying, subgraph extraction based on textual criteria, relation inference, node classification explanation, and simple graph editing commands (e.g., "Add an edge representing 'discovered' between 'penicillin' and 'Alexander Fleming'").

This approach aims to create a single, powerful model capable of understanding complex graph structures and interacting with them through natural language, enabling users without graph expertise to leverage graph-based insights.

### 2.4 Research Objectives
The primary objectives of this research are:
1.  **Develop the GraphLang Architecture:** Design and implement a robust multi-modal Transformer architecture capable of jointly processing diverse graph types (including attributed, heterogeneous graphs) and natural language text.
2.  **Curate Large-Scale Pretraining Data:** Collect and preprocess diverse paired graph-text datasets from multiple domains (KGs, molecules, scene graphs, potentially others like code graphs or social networks).
3.  **Implement Unified Pretraining Strategy:** Implement and execute the proposed multi-task pretraining regimen (masked reconstruction, graph-to-text, contrastive alignment) to train the GraphLang foundation model.
4.  **Develop Instruction Tuning Framework:** Create a diverse instruction-following dataset for graph-related tasks and fine-tune the pretrained GraphLang model to enhance its interactive capabilities.
5.  **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Rigorously evaluate GraphLang's performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, including zero-shot graph question answering, interactive subgraph retrieval, language-driven graph editing, and comparison against state-of-the-art GNNs, LLMs, and existing graph-language models.

### 2.5 Significance
This research holds significant potential impact:
1.  **Democratization of Graph Data:** GraphLang aims to provide an intuitive natural language interface for querying, analyzing, and manipulating complex graph data, making it accessible to domain experts (e.g., biologists, chemists, social scientists) who may lack specialized graph learning skills.
2.  **Advancement of Foundation Models:** It pushes the boundaries of foundation models by extending them to effectively handle structured graph data alongside language, contributing to the development of more versatile and general AI systems.
3.  **Accelerating Scientific Discovery:** By enabling easier interaction with scientific graphs (molecular, biological, knowledge graphs), GraphLang could accelerate hypothesis generation, data exploration, and knowledge discovery in various scientific fields, aligning with the GLFrontiers goal of promoting Graph AI for Science.
4.  **Bridging Symbolic and Sub-symbolic AI:** Integrating graph structures (often representing symbolic knowledge) with neural language models (sub-symbolic) addresses a fundamental challenge in AI, potentially leading to more robust and explainable reasoning systems.
5.  **Enabling Novel Applications:** A successful GraphLang model could enable new applications like conversational graph databases, AI-assisted graph construction and curation, and more grounded multimodal reasoning systems (e.g., connecting scene graphs to visual understanding).

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 GraphLang Architecture
The core of GraphLang will be a multi-modal Transformer architecture. We envision an encoder-decoder structure, potentially sharing parameters or using cross-attention mechanisms to fuse information from both modalities.

*   **Text Encoder:** A standard Transformer-based encoder (e.g., BERT-style or T5-style) will process the input natural language text, producing contextualized token embeddings. Input text will be tokenized using a standard tokenizer (e.g., SentencePiece).
*   **Graph Encoder:** A graph Transformer or a powerful Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) variant capable of handling diverse graph structures (potentially adapting techniques for heterogeneity, e.g., based on R-GCN (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018) or HAN (Wang et al., 2019), or universal graph transformers) will process the input graph. Nodes, edges, and their features will be embedded. We will explore techniques for handling large graphs, potentially involving graph sampling or hierarchical representations. The graph encoder will output node and graph-level embeddings.
*   **Fusion Mechanism:** Cross-attention layers within the Transformer decoder (or a dedicated fusion module) will allow the model to attend to both text and graph representations when generating outputs (either text or graph edits). For tasks requiring only understanding (e.g., classification, contrastive alignment), graph and text embeddings can be fused or concatenated before a final projection layer.

Let $T = \{t_1, ..., t_m\}$ be the tokenized text input and $G = (V, E, X_V, X_E)$ be the input graph with node features $X_V$ and edge features $X_E$.
The text encoder $f_{text}$ produces text embeddings $H_T = f_{text}(T)$.
The graph encoder $f_{graph}$ produces node embeddings $H_V$ and potentially a graph embedding $h_G$: $(H_V, h_G) = f_{graph}(G)$.
The fusion mechanism $f_{fusion}$ combines these representations for downstream tasks or generation. For example, in graph-to-text generation, the decoder attends to $H_V$ and $h_G$. In text-conditioned graph prediction, the model uses $H_T$ to guide predictions on $G$.

### 3.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing
We will aggregate large-scale paired graph-text datasets from diverse public sources:
1.  **Knowledge Graphs:** Wikidata, Freebase, DBpedia. Pairs will consist of subgraphs (e.g., entity-centric subgraphs) and corresponding textual descriptions (e.g., Wikipedia summaries, entity descriptions).
2.  **Molecular Data:** PubChem, ChEMBL. Pairs will include molecule graphs (SMILES strings converted to graphs) and associated textual data (e.g., descriptions, properties, bioassay results summaries).
3.  **Scene Graphs:** Visual Genome, COCO-Stuff (using scene graph annotations). Pairs will link scene graphs representing object relationships and attributes to image captions or detailed scene descriptions.
4.  *(Optional)* **Code Graphs:** Public code repositories (e.g., GitHub) linking code abstract syntax trees (ASTs) or control-flow graphs to code comments or documentation.

**Preprocessing:**
*   Graphs will be standardized into a common format (e.g., adjacency lists with node/edge features). Heterogeneous graphs will retain node/edge type information. Large graphs might require subgraph sampling strategies during training.
*   Text will be cleaned and tokenized.
*   Crucially, reliable alignment between graph elements (nodes, edges, subgraphs) and corresponding text spans must be established or curated, potentially using heuristics, existing annotations, or weak supervision techniques.

### 3.3 Pretraining Strategy
GraphLang will be pretrained using a combination of self-supervised objectives on the aggregated dataset:

1.  **Masked Structure Reconstruction (MSR):** Randomly mask nodes or edges (and their features) in the input graph $G$. The model must predict the masked elements based on the remaining graph structure and the associated text $T$.
    *   Loss: Typically cross-entropy for categorical features/types or L1/L2 loss for continuous features.
    $$L_{MSR} = L_{node\_recon} + L_{edge\_recon}$$
2.  **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):** Standard MLM objective on the text input $T$, predicting masked tokens based on surrounding text and the associated graph $G$.
    *   Loss: Cross-entropy loss.
    $$L_{MLM}$$
3.  **Graph-to-Text Generation (G2T):** Given an input graph $G$ (or subgraph), the model generates its corresponding textual description $T$.
    *   Loss: Standard sequence-to-sequence loss (e.g., cross-entropy).
    $$L_{G2T}$$
4.  **Contrastive Graph-Text Alignment (GTA):** Learn aligned representations for graphs and texts. Given a batch of $(G, T)$ pairs, the model aims to maximize the similarity between corresponding $(G_i, T_i)$ embeddings while minimizing similarity with non-corresponding pairs $(G_i, T_j)$ where $i \neq j$.
    *   Loss: InfoNCE or similar contrastive loss function. Let $s(g, t)$ be the cosine similarity between graph embedding $g$ and text embedding $t$.
    $$L_{GTA} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log \frac{\exp(s(g_i, t_i) / \tau)}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(s(g_i, t_j) / \tau)}$$
    (And potentially a symmetric term for text-to-graph matching). $\tau$ is a temperature hyperparameter.

The total pretraining loss will be a weighted sum of these individual losses:
$$L_{pretrain} = \alpha L_{MSR} + \beta L_{MLM} + \gamma L_{G2T} + \delta L_{GTA}$$
Weights $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta)$ will be determined empirically via hyperparameter tuning.

### 3.4 Instruction Tuning
After pretraining, GraphLang will be fine-tuned on a dataset of instructions covering various graph-related tasks. This dataset will consist of (instruction, input\_graph [optional], output) tuples.

*   **Data Format Examples:**
    *   *Querying:* (Instruction: "What drugs target protein BRAF?", Input Graph: KG, Output: List of drug nodes)
    *   *Subgraph Retrieval:* (Instruction: "Show me the subgraph around molecule X related to its solubility.", Input Graph: Molecule DB, Output: Relevant subgraph)
    *   *Explanation:* (Instruction: "Why was node Y classified as 'toxic'?", Input Graph: Molecule Graph + Predictions, Output: Textual explanation citing specific substructures)
    *   *Editing:* (Instruction: "Add a 'located_in' edge between 'Eiffel Tower' and 'Paris'.", Input Graph: KG, Output: Modified KG)
*   **Data Generation:** We will leverage existing graph QA datasets (e.g., WebQSP, MetaQA), potentially reformatting them. We will also generate synthetic instructions using templates, rule-based systems, and potentially leveraging powerful LLMs (like GPT-4) to paraphrase or generate diverse instructions and expected outputs based on schema and graph instances.
*   **Tuning Process:** Standard supervised fine-tuning using a sequence-to-sequence loss (for text or structured outputs like node lists) or task-specific losses (e.g., graph edit distance proxy loss for editing). The objective is to teach the model to follow instructions accurately and generate appropriate responses (text, subgraphs, graph modifications).
$$L_{instruct}$$ will be optimized during this phase.

### 3.5 Experimental Design

*   **Datasets:** We will evaluate on established benchmarks across different domains and tasks:
    *   *Graph Question Answering:* WebQSP, ComplexWebQuestions, MetaQA (for KGs), MoleculeNet QA benchmarks (if available), CLEVR-Graph (for scene graphs).
    *   *Node/Link Prediction:* Standard benchmarks like OGB node property prediction (ogbn-arxiv, ogbn-proteins) and link prediction (ogbl-ppa, ogbl-wikikg2), adapted for zero-shot or few-shot evaluation prompted by language. Evaluate on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs (using benchmarks identified by Luan et al., 2022, 2024).
    *   *Graph-to-Text:* KG-to-text (e.g., WebNLG), Molecule Captioning (e.g., ChEBI description generation).
    *   *Text-guided Graph Tasks:* Develop synthetic benchmarks for interactive subgraph retrieval and language-driven graph editing based on existing large graphs (e.g., Wikidata, PubChem).

*   **Baselines:** We will compare GraphLang against:
    *   *Specialized GNNs:* State-of-the-art GNNs for specific tasks (e.g., GCN, GAT, GraphTransformer on node classification; ComplEx, RotatE on KG completion).
    *   *LLMs (Prompted):* Large Language Models (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, Llama) prompted with serialized graph information (as done in GraphText).
    *   *Existing Graph-Language Models:* GraphText (Zhao et al., 2023), GraphGPT (Tang et al., 2023), GraphLLM (Chai et al., 2023), potentially GRAPHGPT-O (Fang et al., 2025, if implementation details allow comparison) if applicable to the tasks.
    *   *Multimodal Models (for Scene Graphs):* Models combining vision, language, and potentially graph representations for scene understanding.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   *QA:* Accuracy, F1-score, Hits@k.
    *   *Node/Link Prediction:* Accuracy, AUC-ROC, MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank).
    *   *Graph-to-Text:* BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, CIDEr.
    *   *Subgraph Retrieval:* Precision@k, Recall@k, F1@k based on retrieved nodes/edges vs. ground truth.
    *   *Graph Editing:* Task Success Rate (did the instruction get executed correctly?), Graph Edit Distance (or relevant proxy) between the resulting graph and the target graph.
    *   *Efficiency:* Training time, inference latency, model size.

*   **Ablation Studies:** We will conduct ablation studies to evaluate:
    *   The contribution of each pretraining task ($L_{MSR}, L_{MLM}, L_{G2T}, L_{GTA}$).
    *   The impact of instruction tuning vs. zero-shot performance of the pretrained model.
    *   The effect of different graph encoder choices.
    *   Performance variations across different graph domains (KG, Molecules, Scene Graphs) and graph types (homophilic vs. heterophilic).
    *   Scalability concerning graph size and text length.

This directly addresses the need for more usable and generic tools for graph learning.
2.  **Pioneering Graph Foundation Models:** GraphLang will serve as a proof-of-concept and a strong baseline for the emerging field of graph foundation models, demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of unifying diverse graph types and language within a single pretrained model, aligning with a key topic of the GLFrontiers workshop.

This addresses the challenge of graph/knowledge enhanced LLMs.
4.  **Facilitating Scientific Discovery:** Enabling scientists to ask natural language questions about complex biological networks, chemical compound interactions, or research knowledge graphs can significantly accelerate the pace of discovery. For instance, a biologist could ask "Show me proteins interacting with TP53 that are implicated in breast cancer according to recent publications" and receive both a subgraph and textual summary. This directly supports the 'Graph AI for Science' theme.
5.  **Advancing Multimodal AI:** GraphLang contributes to the broader field of multimodal learning by tackling the fusion of language and structured graph data, complementing existing work on text, image, and audio integration. Its architecture and pretraining techniques may inspire new approaches for other multimodal combinations involving structured data.

In summary, the GraphLang project proposes a novel and ambitious approach to unify graph and language understanding within a single foundation model. By leveraging large-scale diverse data and a combination of pretraining and instruction tuning, we aim to create a powerful, interactive tool that significantly lowers the barrier to entry for graph data analysis and interaction, ultimately expanding the reach and impact of graph learning across scientific and industrial domains.
