### Title: "Temporal Attention Networks for Explainable Time Series Forecasting in Healthcare"

### Motivation
The ability to forecast and explain health outcomes using time series data is crucial for proactive healthcare. Current methods often struggle with interpretability and scalability, hindering their practical deployment. This research aims to bridge this gap by developing a novel Temporal Attention Network (TAN) that not only forecasts health outcomes but also provides interpretable insights.

### Main Idea
The proposed research focuses on developing a Temporal Attention Network (TAN) that leverages attention mechanisms to dynamically weigh the importance of different time points in a time series. The TAN will be trained on multimodal healthcare data, such as wearable sensors, EHRs, and medical imaging, to predict health outcomes. The model will incorporate a self-explanatory module that generates interpretable attention maps, highlighting the most influential time points in the prediction process. This approach addresses the challenges of high-dimensional data, missing values, and noisy measurements by using a robust attention mechanism that can handle irregular data distributions.

The methodology involves:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and irregular time series using interpolation and smoothing techniques.
2. **Model Architecture**: Designing a TAN with attention layers that adaptively focus on relevant time points.
3. **Training**: Using supervised learning with cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization.
4. **Interpretability**: Implementing a self-explanatory module to generate attention maps that explain the model's predictions.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved accuracy in forecasting health outcomes.
- Enhanced interpretability, aiding healthcare professionals in understanding and trusting the model's predictions.
- Robustness to noisy and irregular data distributions.

Potential impact:
- Facilitates proactive healthcare by enabling timely interventions.
- Enhances patient care through interpretable and actionable insights.
- Promotes the deployment of machine learning models in healthcare by addressing current limitations in interpretability and scalability.
