# Adaptive Continuous-Time Masked Autoencoder for Multi-Modal Health Signals

## Introduction

Health time series data, such as those from electronic health records (EHR), wearable sensors, and medical imaging, offer vast potential for improving healthcare outcomes. However, the unique challenges of these datasets, including irregular sampling, missing values, and multimodal data, make them particularly difficult to model using conventional machine learning techniques. Existing methods, such as Transformers and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), often struggle with these idiosyncrasies, limiting their practical utility in real-world clinical settings. This research aims to address these challenges by proposing an Adaptive Continuous-Time Masked Autoencoder (CT-MAE) that can effectively handle irregular sampling, missing values, and multimodal data integration.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a self-supervised foundation model that can learn robust representations from multi-modal health signals. Specifically, the CT-MAE will:

1. **Encode Irregular Sampling**: Utilize learnable temporal kernels to capture the irregular gaps in the time series data.
2. **Mask Values and Timestamps**: Randomly mask both values and timestamps across modalities to encourage the model to learn from missing data.
3. **Reconstruct Missing Segments**: Jointly reconstruct missing segments across EHR, ECG, and wearable channels using cross-modal attention.
4. **Pretraining and Fine-Tuning**: Pretrain on large multi-site cohorts and fine-tune for specific healthcare tasks such as sepsis forecasting or arrhythmia detection.

### Significance

The proposed CT-MAE model addresses several critical challenges in health time series data modeling. By incorporating continuous-time processing and cross-modal attention, the model can handle irregular sampling and missing values more effectively than existing methods. Additionally, the use of masked autoencoders allows the model to learn robust representations that generalize well across different patient populations and clinical settings. The ability to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates and interpretability via attention maps further enhances the model's utility in clinical decision-making.

## Methodology

### Model Architecture

The CT-MAE consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is a continuous-time Transformer that processes irregular inputs without imputation, while the decoder uses cross-modal attention to leverage complementary signals.

#### Encoder

The encoder is a continuous-time Transformer that processes irregular inputs by encoding each timestamp using learnable temporal kernels. These kernels capture the irregular gaps in the time series data, allowing the model to handle variable intervals effectively. The encoder takes the following form:

\[ \mathbf{H}_t = \text{CT-Transformer}(\mathbf{X}_t, \mathbf{K}_t) \]

where \(\mathbf{X}_t\) is the input time series at timestamp \(t\), and \(\mathbf{K}_t\) is the learnable temporal kernel.

#### Decoder

The decoder reconstructs missing segments jointly across EHR, ECG, and wearable channels using cross-modal attention. It takes the following form:

\[ \hat{\mathbf{X}}_t = \text{Decoder}(\mathbf{H}_t, \mathbf{M}_t) \]

where \(\mathbf{M}_t\) is the mask indicating the missing segments at timestamp \(t\).

### Masking Strategy

The CT-MAE employs a masking strategy that randomly masks both values and timestamps across modalities. This strategy encourages the model to learn from missing data and improves its robustness to irregular sampling. The masking is performed as follows:

1. **Value Masking**: Randomly mask a fraction of the values in the input time series.
2. **Timestamp Masking**: Randomly mask a fraction of the timestamps, effectively removing segments of the time series.

### Pretraining and Fine-Tuning

The CT-MAE is pretrained on large multi-site cohorts to learn robust representations. The pretraining objective is to reconstruct the masked segments, encouraging the model to learn effective representations of the input time series. The pretraining loss is given by:

\[ \mathcal{L}_{\text{pretrain}} = \sum_{t} \text{MSE}(\mathbf{X}_t, \hat{\mathbf{X}}_t) \]

where \(\text{MSE}\) denotes the mean squared error between the input and reconstructed time series.

After pretraining, the model can be fine-tuned for specific healthcare tasks such as sepsis forecasting or arrhythmia detection. The fine-tuning objective is to minimize the task-specific loss, such as cross-entropy for classification tasks or mean squared error for regression tasks.

### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the CT-MAE is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Reconstruction Accuracy**: The mean squared error between the input and reconstructed time series.
2. **Task-Specific Accuracy**: The accuracy of the model on the specific healthcare task, such as sepsis forecasting or arrhythmia detection.
3. **Uncertainty Estimation**: The calibration of the model's uncertainty estimates, measured using the Expected Calibration Error (ECE).
4. **Interpretability**: The interpretability of the model's outputs, measured using attention maps.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

The proposed CT-MAE model is expected to deliver several key outcomes:

1. **Robustness to Irregular Sampling and Missing Data**: The model's ability to handle irregular sampling and missing values will significantly improve its performance on health time series data.
2. **Effective Multi-Modal Data Integration**: The use of cross-modal attention in the decoder will enable the model to effectively integrate information from multiple data sources, improving its overall performance.
3. **Calibrated Uncertainty Estimates**: The model's ability to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates will enhance its utility in clinical decision-making.
4. **Interpretability**: The use of attention maps will provide insights into the model's decision-making process, improving its interpretability.

### Impact

The successful development of the CT-MAE model is expected to have a significant impact on the field of health time series modeling. By addressing the unique challenges of health time series data, the model will enable more accurate and reliable predictions, improving healthcare outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare professionals. Additionally, the model's interpretability and uncertainty estimation capabilities will enhance its utility in clinical decision-making, facilitating more informed and effective treatment recommendations.
