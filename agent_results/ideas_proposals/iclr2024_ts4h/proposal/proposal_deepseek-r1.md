**Title**: Adaptive Continuous-Time Masked Autoencoder for Robust Multi-Modal Health Time Series Analysis  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Health time series data—such as electronic health records (EHR), electrocardiograms (ECG), and wearable sensor streams—hold immense potential for revolutionizing clinical decision-making. However, these data are fraught with challenges: irregular sampling intervals, pervasive missing values, heterogeneous modalities (e.g., lab results vs. sensor signals), and distribution shifts across populations. Traditional approaches like Transformers and variational autoencoders (VAEs) often rely on fixed-interval assumptions, imputation, or modality-specific architectures, leading to suboptimal performance in noisy, real-world healthcare settings. Recent advances in masked autoencoders (MAEs) and continuous-time models have shown promise in addressing discrete aspects of these challenges (e.g., bioFAME for frequency-aware biosignals, Time-Series Transformer for irregular sampling), but no unified framework exists to jointly handle multi-modal health time series while accounting for their intrinsic irregularities.  

**Research Objectives**  
This work proposes an **Adaptive Continuous-Time Masked Autoencoder (CT-MAE)** to bridge this gap. Key objectives include:  
1. Design a continuous-time encoder using learnable temporal kernels to process irregularly sampled inputs without imputation.  
2. Develop a multi-modal masked pretraining strategy that jointly reconstructs missing segments across EHR, ECG, and wearable data.  
3. Enable interpretable and uncertainty-aware predictions for clinical tasks such as sepsis forecasting and arrhythmia detection.  
4. Validate CT-MAE’s robustness under missing data, modality misalignment, and distribution shifts via large-scale multi-site cohorts.  

**Significance**  
CT-MAE addresses critical barriers to deploying AI in healthcare: handling missingness natively, fusing multi-modal signals, and providing explainable outputs. By unifying continuous-time processing with self-supervised pretraining, the model reduces reliance on annotated data while improving generalization across clinical scenarios. This could advance applications like early disease detection, personalized treatment recommendations, and real-time wearable monitoring, ultimately enhancing healthcare accessibility and outcomes.

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### **Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
- **Datasets**:  
  - **MIMIC-IV EHR**: Longitudinal ICU data with lab measurements, diagnoses, and treatments.  
  - **Wearable Datasets**: PPG, accelerometer, and ECG streams from public repositories (e.g., UK Biobank, PhysioNet).  
  - **Multimodal Paired Data**: Cohorts with synchronized EHR, ECG, and wearable data (e.g., Emory Healthcare’s Sepsis Cohort).  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - **Temporal Alignment**: Convert all modalities to continuous-time sequences with timestamps.  
  - **Missingness Handling**: Retain natural missingness patterns during pretraining; no imputation applied.  

#### **CT-MAE Architecture**  
The model consists of a **continuous-time encoder** and a **cross-modal decoder**:  

1. **Encoder**:  
   - **Temporal Kernel Embedding**: For each input feature $x(t)$ at time $t$, project irregular intervals into a continuous latent space using learnable Gaussian-process-inspired basis functions:  
     $$
     h(t) = \sum_{i=1}^K \alpha_i \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{(t - \mu_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
     $$  
     where $\{\mu_i, \sigma_i\}$ are learnable parameters, and $\alpha_i$ are attention weights from a Transformer layer.  
   - **Continuous-Time Transformer**: Apply multi-head self-attention to the kernel-encoded features, with positional encodings derived from time differences $\Delta t$.  

2. **Masking Strategy**:  
   - **Sparse Spatiotemporal Masking**: Randomly mask 60–80% of input values *and* their timestamps across all modalities. Masked regions vary in length to emulate real-world missingness.  

3. **Decoder**:  
   - **Cross-Modal Attention**: Reconstruct masked segments using inter-modal dependencies. For modality $m$, the decoder attends to latent representations of other modalities $m' \neq m$ via cross-attention layers.  
   - **Uncertainty-Calibrated Outputs**: Predict Gaussian parameters ($\mu_m, \sigma_m$) for each reconstructed feature to estimate prediction uncertainty.  

#### **Training and Optimization**  
- **Pretraining Loss**:  
  Combine modality-specific reconstruction losses with uncertainty calibration:  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{pretrain}} = \sum_{m=1}^M \left( \frac{1}{\sigma_m^2} \|x_m - \mu_m\|^2 + \log \sigma_m^2 \right) + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}(q(z), p(z))
  $$  
  where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}$ regularizes the latent space $z$ using a prior distribution $p(z)$.  
- **Fine-Tuning**: Use task-specific heads (e.g., logistic regression for sepsis prediction) with frozen pretrained encoder.  

#### **Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against state-of-the-art methods:  
  - **Time-Series Transformer** [Qian et al., 2021]  
  - **MMAE-ECG** [Zhou et al., 2025]  
  - **bioFAME** [Liu et al., 2023]  
  - **C-MELT** [Pham et al., 2024]  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Forecasting/Classification**: AUROC, AUPRC, F1-score.  
  - **Reconstruction**: RMSE, MAE.  
  - **Uncertainty Calibration**: Expected calibration error (ECE), Brier score.  
  - **Interpretability**: Attention weight analysis, saliency maps.  
- **Tasks**:  
  1. **Sepsis Onset Prediction** (EHR time series)  
  2. **Arrhythmia Detection** (ECG + wearable PPG)  
  3. **Missing Data Imputation** (cross-modal reconstruction)  
- **Ablation Studies**:  
  - Impact of spatiotemporal masking ratios.  
  - Contribution of cross-modal attention vs. modality-specific decoders.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Superior Performance**: CT-MAE will outperform existing methods in sepsis forecasting (AUROC > 0.90) and arrhythmia detection (F1 > 0.85) under 50–70% missing data, as validated on MIMIC-IV and wearable datasets.  
2. **Robustness**: The model will maintain consistent performance across distribution shifts (e.g., cross-hospital validation) due to its continuous-time formulation and uncertainty calibration.  
3. **Interpretability**: Attention maps will reveal clinically relevant cross-modal interactions (e.g., elevated heart rate preceding septic shock in EHR).  
4. **Efficiency**: Pretrained CT-MAE will enable lightweight fine-tuning (<10% parameters updated) for new tasks, reducing computational costs.  

**Impact**  
By addressing the core challenges of health time series analysis—irregular sampling, missing data, and multi-modal fusion—CT-MAE will bridge the gap between academic research and clinical deployment. The model’s self-supervised design reduces reliance on scarce annotated data, making it applicable in low-resource settings. Open-sourcing CT-MAE and pretrained weights will accelerate innovation in personalized medicine, while uncertainty estimates and interpretability tools will enhance clinician trust. Ultimately, this work aims to establish a new paradigm for foundation models in healthcare, enabling reliable, real-time AI support for critical decision-making.
