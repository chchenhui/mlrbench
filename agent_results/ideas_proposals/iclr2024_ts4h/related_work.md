**2. Key Challenges**

1. **Irregular Sampling and Missing Data**: Health time series often exhibit irregular intervals and missing entries, complicating the modeling of temporal dependencies and reducing the effectiveness of traditional machine learning models.

2. **Multi-Modal Data Integration**: Combining diverse data sources such as EHR, ECG, and wearable sensor data poses challenges due to varying data formats, sampling rates, and noise levels, making effective fusion and interpretation difficult.

3. **Model Interpretability and Uncertainty Estimation**: Ensuring that models provide interpretable outputs and reliable uncertainty estimates is crucial for clinical decision-making but remains challenging in complex, multimodal settings.

4. **Computational Efficiency**: Developing models that are both accurate and computationally efficient is essential for real-time applications in healthcare, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and large-scale data.

5. **Generalization and Robustness**: Ensuring that models generalize well across different patient populations and clinical settings, while being robust to variations and noise in the data, is a significant challenge in deploying health time-series AI systems.
