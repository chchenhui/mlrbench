### Title: Meta-Learning for Generalized Sequential Decision-Making

### Motivation:
Meta-learning aims to improve the ability of AI models to adapt to new tasks with minimal training. In the context of sequential decision-making (SDM), meta-learning can significantly enhance the model's generalization and transfer capabilities. Current methods struggle with sample efficiency and generalizability, particularly in long-horizon planning. This research seeks to address these challenges by developing meta-learning algorithms specifically tailored for SDM, enabling models to learn from a few examples and generalize to unseen problems.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research will focus on developing a meta-learning framework for generalized sequential decision-making. The framework will consist of a meta-learner that captures high-level patterns across different SDM tasks and a task-specific learner that adapts to the specifics of each task. The meta-learner will be trained on a diverse set of SDM tasks, learning to recognize and leverage common structures and strategies. The task-specific learner will then fine-tune these general patterns to the specific requirements of the target task.

The methodology will involve:
1. **Meta-Training**: Training the meta-learner on a variety of SDM tasks to learn generalizable features and strategies.
2. **Meta-Testing**: Evaluating the meta-learner's performance on unseen tasks to assess its generalization capabilities.
3. **Task-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Adapting the meta-learner to the specifics of each target task, leveraging the learned general patterns.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved sample efficiency and generalizability in SDM tasks.
- Enhanced transferability of learned policies to new, unseen problems.
- Development of a flexible and adaptable meta-learning framework that can be applied to various SDM domains.

The potential impact of this research is significant, as it addresses critical open problems in AI planning and reinforcement learning, offering a pathway to more robust and adaptable AI systems capable of solving complex sequential decision-making problems efficiently.
