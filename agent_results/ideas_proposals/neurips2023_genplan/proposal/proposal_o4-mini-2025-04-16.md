1. Title:  
Neuro-Symbolic Hierarchical Planning with Meta-Learned Sub-Policies for Cross-Domain Generalization

2. Introduction  
Background  
Sequential decision-making (SDM) underpins many real-world AI applications, from robotic manipulation to autonomous navigation. Two dominant paradigms have emerged: deep reinforcement learning (RL) and symbolic planning. Deep RL offers adaptability to stochastic environments but often suffers from poor sample efficiency and limited generalization beyond the training distribution. Symbolic planners, by contrast, use human-designed abstractions (e.g., PDDL operators) to achieve robust long-horizon reasoning and guaranteed completeness, yet they struggle with perceptual grounding and short-horizon control in complex, uncertain domains. Bridging these complementary strengths is critical for enabling agents that can plan high-level strategies while adapting low-level execution to unseen tasks with minimal data.

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a unified neuro-symbolic hierarchical planning framework, called NSHP-Meta, that combines a symbolic planner’s long-horizon structure with meta-learned neural sub-policies for rapid cross-domain adaptation. Our key objectives are:  
• To design a bi-level optimization scheme aligning symbolic abstractions with the capabilities of neural sub-policies.  
• To incorporate contrastive meta-learning for disentangling task-invariant and task-specific policy components, enabling zero-shot transfer.  
• To integrate a neuro-symbolic plan repair mechanism guided by large language models (LLMs) and formal verification modules to ensure constraint satisfaction and safety.

Significance  
A successful NSHP-Meta framework will (i) dramatically improve zero-shot and few-shot generalization across diverse SDM problem classes, (ii) reduce sample complexity in meta-learning by leveraging symbolic abstractions, and (iii) pave the way for deployable, provably safe hybrid agents in robotics, logistics, and automated planning domains. This work unites advances from reinforcement learning, automated planning, and formal methods, addressing core challenges in transfer and generalization for SDM.

3. Methodology  
3.1. Overview of NSHP-Meta  
NSHP-Meta is organized into three interacting modules:  
1. Symbolic Planner: Generates abstract task hierarchies over PDDL operators.  
2. Neural Sub-Policies: Low-level controllers parameterized by $\theta$, trained via meta-reinforcement learning.  
3. Neuro-Symbolic Repair & Verification: Refines and certifies plans using LLM guidance and formal methods.

3.2. Problem Formulation  
Let $\mathcal{D} = \{\mathcal{T}_i\}$ be a set of training tasks from various domains. Each task $\mathcal{T}_i$ is defined by a state space $\mathcal{S}_i$, action space $\mathcal{A}_i$, PDDL domain $\mathcal{P}_i$, and reward function $r_i: \mathcal{S}_i \times \mathcal{A}_i \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Our goal is to learn:  
• A symbolic abstraction mapping $\phi: \{\mathcal{P}_i\} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}_{\text{abs}}$, a set of high-level action schemas (e.g., “navigate,” “pick‐&‐place”).  
• A set of neural sub-policies $\pi_\theta(a_{\text{abs}} \mid s)$ that execute each abstract action in new tasks with minimal fine-tuning.  

We formalize planning as finding a sequence $\tau = (a^1_{\text{abs}}, \dots, a^H_{\text{abs}})$, where each $a^h_{\text{abs}} \in \mathcal{A}_{\text{abs}}$ transitions the abstract state. The overall objective for a new task $\mathcal{T}_\text{new}$ is to maximize expected return:
$$
J(\phi, \theta; \mathcal{T}_\text{new}) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \mathrm{Planner}(\phi, \mathcal{P}_{\text{new}})}\Bigl[\sum_{t=1}^H r_{\text{new}}(s_t, a^{h(t)}_{\text{abs}})\Bigr],
$$
where $h(t)$ maps time steps to abstract actions.

3.3. Bi-Level Optimization  
We propose a joint optimization over abstraction parameters $\phi$ and policy weights $\theta$ via bi-level learning:  

Inner Loop (Meta-RL adaptation):  
For each training task $\mathcal{T}_i$, perform $K$ gradient steps to adapt $\theta$:
$$
\theta_i' = \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}}(\theta; \mathcal{T}_i),
$$
where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}}$ is the negative expected return under the current abstraction $\phi$.

Outer Loop (Symbolic Alignment):  
Update $\phi$ to maximize the post-adaptation performance across tasks:
$$
\phi \leftarrow \phi - \beta \nabla_\phi \sum_i \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(\phi, \theta_i'; \mathcal{T}_i),
$$
where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$ incorporates planning success, symbolic–neural mismatch penalties, and abstraction compactness.

3.4. Contrastive Meta-Learning  
To disentangle invariant features $z_{\text{inv}}$ (reusable across domains) from variant features $z_{\text{var}}$, we augment each sub-policy with an encoder $f_\omega(s)$ producing representations. We apply a contrastive loss:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{ctr}} = - \sum_{(s, s^+)} \log \frac{\exp\bigl(f_\omega(s)\cdot f_\omega(s^+)/\tau\bigr)}{\sum_{s^-}\exp\bigl(f_\omega(s)\cdot f_\omega(s^-)/\tau\bigr)},
$$
where $(s,s^+)$ are positive pairs from the same task and $s^-$ are negatives from different tasks. This encourages $f_\omega$ to cluster task-invariant contexts while separating task-specific ones.

3.5. Neuro-Symbolic Plan Repair with LLMs  
Even with aligned abstractions, discrepancies can arise between symbolic plans and neural executability. We introduce an LLM-guided repair module: when the symbolic plan fails a precondition at execution time, we query a fine-tuned LLM $g_\psi$:
Input: partial plan $\tau_{1:h}$ and execution trace.  
Output: refined subgoal or operator substitution.  
We integrate the LLM suggestion and re-verify via symbolic precondition checks, forming a closed-loop refinement.

3.6. Formal Verification  
To ensure safety and constraint adherence, we encode each abstract operator’s pre/postconditions in a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver. Before execution of each sub-policy, we check:
$$
\text{SMT\_Check}(\mathrm{pre}(a_{\text{abs}}), s_t) = \text{SAT},
$$
and abort or repair if UNSAT. This layer guarantees that learned neural controllers do not violate critical constraints (e.g., collision avoidance).

• Dramatic reduction (≥30%) in adaptation episodes needed to reach high performance, owing to meta-learned sub-policies and task disentanglement.  
• Robust symbolic–neural alignment yielding fewer execution failures and constraint violations (<5% failure rate) through bi-level optimization and formal verification.  
• Efficient plan repair with LLM guidance that recovers from symbolic errors in over 80% of cases, reducing manual intervention.

Impact  
By fusing symbolic planning, meta-reinforcement learning, and formal methods, NSHP-Meta bridges critical gaps among AI sub-fields. The framework’s cross-domain generalization capabilities will empower robotic systems to adapt to new tasks on the fly, accelerating deployment in warehouses, healthcare, and service robotics. Moreover, our bi-level and contrastive training algorithms will inform future meta-learning research on sample efficiency and transfer learning. The integration of LLMs for plan repair further opens pathways toward human-like reasoning and corrective feedback in autonomous agents. Overall, this research advances the state of the art in generalizable planning and paves the way for robust, safe, and versatile AI systems capable of navigating complex, dynamic environments with minimal retraining.
