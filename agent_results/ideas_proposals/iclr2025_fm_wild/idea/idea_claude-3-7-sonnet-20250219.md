# Multi-Modal Memory Augmentation for Enhanced Reasoning in Foundation Models

## Motivation
Foundation Models (FMs) often struggle with complex reasoning tasks when deployed in the wild, particularly in domains requiring multi-step thinking or specialized knowledge. Current approaches like RAG or ICL provide temporary memory extensions but fall short in handling sophisticated reasoning chains across different modalities. This limitation significantly impacts applications in healthcare, scientific discovery, and education where complex problem-solving combines text, images, and structured data. Enhancing FMs' reasoning capabilities could revolutionize how these models support experts in critical domains.

## Main Idea
I propose a hierarchical external memory architecture that dynamically integrates with FMs to support multi-modal reasoning paths. The system maintains three memory layers: (1) a factual knowledge store with domain-specific information; (2) a reasoning trace memory that records intermediate deductions across modalities; and (3) a meta-cognitive layer that evaluates reasoning quality and identifies potential errors. During inference, the model employs a transformer-based controller to retrieve relevant information, track reasoning progression, and identify when to backtrack upon detecting logical inconsistencies. This architecture enables FMs to decompose complex problems into manageable sub-problems while maintaining coherence across different reasoning steps and modalities. Evaluations will focus on multi-hop question answering involving medical images and text, mathematical problem-solving requiring visual interpretation, and scientific reasoning tasks combining multiple evidence types.
