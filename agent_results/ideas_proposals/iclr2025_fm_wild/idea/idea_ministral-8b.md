### Title: Enhancing Foundation Models for Multi-Domain Adaptation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation

### Motivation
Foundation models (FMs) hold immense promise but face significant challenges when deployed in real-world scenarios. Ensuring FMs can adapt to diverse domains, such as drug discovery, education, or clinical health, is crucial for their practical utility. Current approaches often struggle with the complexity and specificity of these domains, leading to suboptimal performance. This research aims to address this gap by proposing a novel method for multi-domain adaptation using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

### Main Idea
The proposed research will develop a framework that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the adaptability of FMs across various domains. The methodology involves the following steps:
1. **Domain-Specific Knowledge Retrieval**: Implement a sophisticated retrieval system that can fetch relevant domain-specific knowledge from a vast corpus.
2. **Contextual Adaptation**: Utilize In-context Learning (ICL) to adapt the FM to the retrieved context, enabling it to understand and generate responses tailored to the specific domain.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Employ domain-specific fine-tuning to further enhance the model's performance within the target domain.

The expected outcomes include:
- Improved adaptability of FMs to diverse domains.
- Enhanced performance in tasks that require domain-specific knowledge.
- Reduced hallucinations and improved reliability in real-world applications.

The potential impact of this research is significant, as it addresses the critical challenge of in-the-wild adaptation, making FMs more useful and reliable in practical applications. This work will contribute to the broader goal of ensuring that FMs can effectively support decision-making in critical fields such as medicine and finance, thereby enhancing their societal impact.
