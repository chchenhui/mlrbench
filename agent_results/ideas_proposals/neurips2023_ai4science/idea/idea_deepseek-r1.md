**Title:** Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for De Novo Molecular Generation  

**Motivation:** Traditional de novo molecular generation often produces chemically valid but physically implausible candidates, leading to high attrition rates in drug discovery. By neglecting physical stability and dynamic behavior, current AI models waste resources on synthesizing non-viable molecules. Integrating physics-based validation into generative AI can bridge this gap, ensuring candidates are both chemically and physically optimized.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework where a molecular generator (e.g., a graph-based neural network) interacts with a molecular dynamics (MD) simulator. The generator creates candidate molecules, which are evaluated in real-time by MD simulations for stability, binding affinity, and free-energy landscapes. The RL agent receives rewards based on these physical metrics alongside traditional chemical properties (e.g., solubility, toxicity). The model will iteratively refine candidates using gradient updates from the reward signal. Key innovations include a lightweight MD surrogate model for rapid feedback and adaptive reward balancing. Expected outcomes include a higher proportion of synthesizable, stable molecules and a 30â€“50% reduction in simulation-driven experimental cycles. This approach could accelerate hit-to-lead stages in drug discovery while fostering AI models grounded in physical reality.
