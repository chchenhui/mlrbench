### 1. **Title**  
**Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for De Novo Molecular Generation**  

---

### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Traditional *de novo* molecular generation aims to design novel compounds with desired chemical properties, such as binding affinity and solubility. However, current AI-driven methods, including reinforcement learning (RL) and Transformer-based models, often prioritize chemical validity over physical plausibility. This oversight leads to high attrition rates in later stages of drug discovery, as generated molecules may lack stability, exhibit unfavorable free-energy landscapes, or fail to interact dynamically with target proteins. Recent studies (e.g., arXiv:2404.05678, arXiv:2311.09876) highlight the promise of integrating physics-based validation into generative models, but challenges such as computational inefficiency and suboptimal reward design persist.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research proposes a novel RL framework that bridges the gap between chemical and physical feasibility in molecular design. Specific objectives include:  
1. Develop a **physics-informed RL pipeline** that combines molecular generation with real-time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.  
2. Train a **lightweight surrogate MD model** to provide rapid feedback on physical stability, binding affinity, and free-energy landscapes.  
3. Design an **adaptive reward mechanism** to balance chemical and physical objectives during RL training.  
4. Validate the framework on benchmark tasks, demonstrating improvements in synthesizability and a reduction in experimental cycles.  

**Significance**  
By embedding physics-based constraints into generative AI, this research aims to reduce the attrition of candidate molecules in drug discovery pipelines. If successful, it could accelerate the hit-to-lead phase by 30–50%, lower computational costs associated with MD simulations, and establish a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific discovery grounded in physical reality.

### 3. **Methodology**  
**Research Design**  
The framework integrates three components: a **molecular generator**, an **MD simulator/surrogate**, and a **reinforcement learning agent** (Figure 1).  

**Data Collection**  
- **Chemical Data**: Curate molecular datasets (e.g., ZINC, ChEMBL) with annotated properties (e.g., solubility, toxicity).  
- **Physical Data**: Generate synthetic data via classical MD simulations (e.g., GROMACS) to train the surrogate model. Key metrics include energy landscapes, stability trajectories, and binding affinities.  

**Algorithmic Framework**  
1. **Graph-Based Molecular Generator**:  
   - A graph neural network (GNN) generates molecular graphs iteratively. At each step, the agent selects an action (e.g., add/remove atoms/bonds) to modify the graph.  
   - **State Space**: Molecular graph represented as $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ denotes atoms and $E$ denotes bonds.  
   - **Action Space**: Discrete actions $\mathcal{A} = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}$ for graph edits.  

2. **Physics Validation with MD Surrogate**:  
   - A neural network surrogate $\mathcal{S}$ approximates MD outputs. Trained on MD simulation data, it predicts stability $\hat{s}$, binding affinity $\hat{b}$, and free energy $\hat{f}$:  
     $$
     \hat{s}, \hat{b}, \hat{f} = \mathcal{S}(G)
     $$  
   - Surrogate training uses mean squared error:  
     $$
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{surrogate}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( s_i - \hat{s}_i \right)^2 + \left( b_i - \hat{b}_i \right)^2 + \left( f_i - \hat{f}_i \right)^2
     $$  

3. **Reinforcement Learning Agent**:  
   - **Reward Function**: Combines chemical ($R_{\text{chem}}$) and physical ($R_{\text{phys}}$) rewards:  
     $$
     R(G) = \alpha R_{\text{chem}}(G) + \beta R_{\text{phys}}(G)
     $$  
     - $R_{\text{chem}}$: Penalizes violations of chemical rules (e.g., valency) and quantifies drug-likeness via QED or SA scores.  
     - $R_{\text{phys}}$: Derived from surrogate outputs:  
       $$
       R_{\text{phys}} = \lambda_1 \hat{s} + \lambda_2 \hat{b} + \lambda_3 (-\hat{f})
       $$  
   - **Adaptive Reward Balancing**: Coefficients $\alpha, \beta, \lambda_i$ are optimized via multi-task learning or Bayesian optimization to prevent reward hacking.  

4. **Training Procedure**:  
   - **Policy Gradient Optimization**: The agent uses proximal policy optimization (PPO) to maximize expected reward:  
     $$
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{PPO}} = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \min\left( \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t|s_t)} A_t, \text{clip}\left(\frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t|s_t)}, 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon\right) A_t \right) \right]
     $$  
   - **Exploration Strategy**: Intrinsic curiosity module incentivizes novel molecular designs to avoid local optima.  

**Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against state-of-the-art models (Mol-AIR, Transformer-based RL, graph RL with static rewards).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Chemical Validity**: Proportion of molecules adhering to rules like valency.  
  - **Physical Plausibility**: Stability (RMSD < 2Å), binding affinity (docking score < -7 kcal/mol), free energy (∆G < 0).  
  - **Efficiency**: Time per generation cycle, number of MD simulations reduced.  
- **Benchmarks**: Use DRD2 inhibitors, SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors, and solubility optimization tasks.

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. A **physics-informed RL framework** that generates molecules with ≥80% chemical validity and ≥60% physical plausibility.  
2. A **lightweight MD surrogate** achieving >90% accuracy compared to classical MD simulations.

**Impact**  
This work addresses critical gaps in AI-driven drug discovery by ensuring that generated molecules are both chemically and physically viable. By reducing reliance on costly MD simulations, it lowers barriers to entry for resource-limited labs. The integration of adaptive rewards and surrogate models provides a blueprint for future AI-for-science tools, fostering collaboration between ML researchers and domain experts. Ultimately, this framework could accelerate therapeutic development for diseases with high unmet need, such as antimicrobial resistance or neurodegenerative disorders.
