## Research Proposal

**1. Title:** **Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Efficient De Novo Generation of Stable and Bioactive Molecules**

**2. Introduction**

*   **Background:** The quest for novel therapeutic agents is a cornerstone of modern medicine and chemical biology. Traditional drug discovery is notoriously long, expensive, and plagued by high attrition rates, often exceeding 90% from preclinical stages to market approval. A significant contributor to this failure rate is the identification of candidate molecules that, while exhibiting promising biochemical activity *in silico* or *in vitro*, possess poor physicochemical or pharmacokinetic properties, including inadequate stability, solubility, or metabolic profiles, rendering them non-viable for *in vivo* applications.

    In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep generative models, has shown remarkable promise in accelerating *de novo* molecular design. Techniques based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformers, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can explore vast chemical spaces and generate novel molecular structures with desired chemical properties (e.g., Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED), Synthetic Accessibility (SA), LogP) [2, 3]. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to fine-tune these generative models towards specific objectives, directly optimizing molecular properties by rewarding the generation of desirable structures [1, 3, 4].

    However, a critical limitation persists in most current AI-driven *de novo* design approaches: they primarily focus on optimizing static chemical features and predicted biological activity, often neglecting the dynamic, physics-based properties that govern a molecule's real-world behavior. Properties like conformational stability, solvation free energy, and dynamic binding interactions are crucial for efficacy and developability but are computationally expensive to evaluate using traditional physics-based methods like Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations or quantum mechanics (QM) [6]. Consequently, generated molecules, although chemically valid and potentially active according to static models, may be conformationally unstable, possess high-energy states, or exhibit poor dynamic interactions with their target, leading to wasted synthetic efforts and late-stage failures.

    Recent efforts have started to bridge this gap by incorporating physical insights. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) aim to embed physical laws into neural network training [5], while some approaches integrate QM calculations [6] or physical constraints directly into generative models or RL reward functions [7, 8]. Others explore integrating full MD simulations, but often as a post-hoc filter rather than within the generative loop due to computational costs [9]. While promising, efficiently integrating dynamic physical evaluations directly within the iterative generation process of RL remains a significant challenge [Key Challenge 2, 3]. The computational expense of full MD simulations is prohibitive for real-time feedback in typical RL training cycles.

*   **Research Objectives:** This research aims to develop and validate a novel Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL) framework that efficiently integrates physics-based evaluations into the *de novo* molecular generation process. Our primary goal is to generate molecules that are not only chemically relevant and potentially bioactive but also possess high physical stability and favorable dynamic properties, thereby increasing the success rate of downstream experimental validation.

    The specific objectives are:
    1.  To design and implement a PIRL framework where a GNN-based molecular generator interacts with both chemical property predictors and physics-based simulation modules within an RL loop.
    2.  To develop and train a computationally efficient, lightweight surrogate model (e.g., a GNN or PINN-based model) capable of rapidly approximating key molecular dynamics properties (e.g., conformational stability, binding energy proxies) derived from full MD simulations.
    3.  To formulate and implement an adaptive reward function within the RL framework that dynamically balances chemical desirability (e.g., QED, SA, predicted affinity) and physical plausibility (e.g., stability, favorable interaction energies). This addresses the challenge of accurate reward design [Key Challenge 3, 10].
    4.  To rigorously evaluate the PIRL framework's performance against state-of-the-art baseline methods, quantifying its ability to generate novel, valid, diverse, and optimized molecules with enhanced physical stability and predicted bioactivity for specific drug targets.
    5.  To demonstrate the framework's potential to reduce the reliance on computationally expensive full MD simulations during the initial design phase, thereby accelerating the hit-to-lead optimization process in drug discovery.

*   **Significance:** This research directly addresses the critical need to incorporate physical realism into AI-driven scientific discovery, a key theme of the AI for Science workshop. By grounding molecular generation in fundamental physical principles, our proposed PIRL framework offers several significant advancements:
    *   **Accelerated Drug Discovery:** By prioritizing physically plausible candidates early in the design cycle, the framework aims to significantly reduce the attrition rate of drug candidates, decrease the number of costly and time-consuming experimental synthesis and validation cycles (aiming for a 30-50% reduction in simulation-driven experimental cycles as per the initial idea), and ultimately accelerate the delivery of new therapeutics.
    *   **Improved AI Models for Science:** It contributes to the development of more robust and reliable AI models that learn from and respect physical laws, moving beyond pattern recognition towards deeper scientific understanding. This directly addresses the challenge of incorporating physical insights into AI.
    *   **Computational Efficiency:** The development of a lightweight MD surrogate model tackles the computational bottleneck of physics-based simulations [Key Challenge 2], making the integration of dynamics feasible within iterative AI optimization loops.
    *   **Enhanced Molecular Quality:** The framework is expected to generate molecules with a higher likelihood of being synthesizable, stable, and possessing favorable dynamic binding characteristics, improving the quality of hits progressing to lead optimization.
    *   **Bridging Disciplinary Gaps:** This work fosters interdisciplinary research, integrating techniques from machine learning, cheminformatics, and computational biophysics.

**3. Methodology**

This section details the proposed research design, including the overall framework, data requirements, algorithmic components, and experimental validation plan.

*   **Overall Framework:** We propose a closed-loop PIRL system (Figure 1 conceptual description):
    1.  **Generator:** A Graph Neural Network (GNN) acts as the policy network ($\pi_\theta$) in an RL setup. It sequentially generates molecular graphs by proposing actions (e.g., adding nodes/atoms, adding edges/bonds, choosing atom/bond types, stopping generation).
    2.  **Molecule Construction:** The sequence of actions produces a molecular graph representation (e.g., SMILES string or graph object).
    3.  **Evaluation Module:** The generated molecule is evaluated by multiple components:
        *   **Chemical Property Predictors:** Standard cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit) calculate properties like QED, SA, LogP, Lipinski rule adherence, etc. A pre-trained bioactivity predictor for the target of interest may also be included.
        *   **Physics Surrogate Model:** A lightweight model predicts key dynamic properties (e.g., RMSD-based stability score, binding energy proxy) based on the molecular structure.
        *   **(Optional/Sparse) Full MD Simulation:** For selected promising candidates or periodically, full MD simulations (using e.g., GROMACS/OpenMM with standard force fields like AMBER/CHARMM) can provide highly accurate physical properties to refine the surrogate or provide direct reward signals.
    4.  **Reward Calculation:** An adaptive reward function combines scores from the chemical and physical evaluations. $R_t = \alpha R_{chem} + (1-\alpha) R_{phys}$.
    5.  **RL Agent:** An RL algorithm (e.g., PPO) uses the reward signal to update the generator's policy parameters ($\theta$) to favor the generation of molecules with higher rewards.

*   **Molecular Generator (Policy Network):**
    *   **Architecture:** We will employ a GNN architecture suitable for graph generation, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) or Graph Attention Networks (GAT), potentially within an autoregressive framework that builds the graph step-by-step. This choice is motivated by GNNs' ability to naturally capture molecular structure and topology [8].
    *   **Action Space:** The action space will consist of discrete choices: adding an atom (from a allowed list, e.g., C, N, O, S, F, Cl, Br), connecting it with a bond (single, double, triple), potentially modifying existing atoms/bonds, and a 'stop' action.
    *   **Pre-training:** The GNN generator will be pre-trained on a large molecular dataset (e.g., ZINC [zinc.docking.org] or ChEMBL [ebi.ac.uk/chembl]) using supervised learning (e.g., maximizing likelihood of known molecules) to ensure it learns basic chemical validity and desirable structural motifs before RL fine-tuning.

*   **Physics-Based Evaluation:**
    *   **Full Molecular Dynamics (MD):** Standard MD protocols will be used for validation and potentially sparse feedback. For stability, a short simulation (e.g., 1-10 ns) in vacuum or implicit solvent will be run, monitoring Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) from the initial minimized structure. Low, stable RMSD indicates conformational stability. For binding, Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) calculations on MD snapshots or docking scores (e.g., using AutoDock Vina) will provide estimates of binding free energy/affinity to a specific protein target. These calculations are computationally expensive.
    *   **Lightweight MD Surrogate Model:** This is a core component addressing [Key Challenge 2]. We will investigate two main approaches:
        1.  *GNN-based Surrogate:* Train a separate GNN to predict MD-derived properties directly from the molecular graph. Input: Molecular Graph. Output: Predicted stability score (e.g., probability of RMSD < 2Å after 5ns), predicted binding affinity proxy. Training data will be generated by running full MD simulations on a diverse set of molecules (e.g., subsets of ZINC, ChEMBL, or generated molecules) and recording their properties.
        2.  *PINN-inspired Surrogate:* Explore incorporating simplified physical constraints or energy terms directly into the surrogate model architecture or loss function, potentially enabling better generalization with less direct MD data.
    *   **Surrogate Training:** The surrogate will be trained offline on the generated MD dataset, minimizing the difference between its predictions and the actual MD results (e.g., Mean Squared Error for continuous values, Cross-Entropy for stability classification).

*   **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**
    *   **Algorithm:** We will primarily use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art policy gradient method known for its stability and sample efficiency, balancing exploration and exploitation [Key Challenge 1]. PPO optimizes a clipped surrogate objective function:
        $$L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t \left[ \min(r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t) \right]$$
        where $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}$ is the probability ratio, $\hat{A}_t$ is the estimated advantage function, and $\epsilon$ is a hyperparameter controlling the clipping. The full objective includes terms for value function loss and entropy bonus for exploration.
    *   **State:** The state $s_t$ will be the current partially generated molecular graph, represented by its GNN embedding.
    *   **Reward Function ($R_t$):** The reward function is critical [Key Challenge 3]. It will be a weighted sum of different components:
        $$R_{total} = w_{valid} R_{valid} + w_{target} R_{target} + w_{chem} R_{chem} + w_{phys} R_{phys}$$
        where:
        *   $R_{valid}$: Penalty for generating chemically invalid molecules.
        *   $R_{target}$: Based on predicted bioactivity against the chosen target (using a pre-trained predictor).
        *   $R_{chem}$: Combined score from desired chemical properties (e.g., QED, SA, LogP penalties).
        *   $R_{phys}$: Score derived from the MD surrogate model (e.g., high score for predicted stability, good predicted binding energy). Intermediate rewards might be given during generation based on partial structure properties.
    *   **Adaptive Reward Balancing ($\alpha$ in $R_t = \alpha R_{chem} + (1-\alpha) R_{phys}$ conceptualization):** We will implement an adaptive weighting scheme for $w_{chem}$ and $w_{phys}$ (or $\alpha$). The weights will dynamically adjust during training based on:
        1.  *Generation Stage:* Initially prioritize chemical validity and basic properties, then increase the weight of physical stability and binding as the molecule nears completion.
        2.  *Performance Metrics:* If the generator struggles with physical stability, increase $w_{phys}$. If chemical diversity drops, increase exploration or adjust chemical weights.
        3.  *Surrogate Confidence:* Potentially down-weight the physical reward if the surrogate model's prediction confidence is low for a given molecule. This mechanism draws inspiration from adaptive reward literature [1, 10].

*   **Data Collection and Generation:**
    *   **Pre-training Data:** ZINC (approx. 250k molecules) or ChEMBL (larger, more drug-focused) datasets.
    *   **MD Surrogate Training Data:** Requires generating MD trajectories. We will start with a diverse subset (e.g., 5,000-10,000 molecules) from ZINC/ChEMBL and run standardized MD simulations (e.g., 5-10ns stability runs, MM-GBSA for selected target complexes). This dataset will be augmented iteratively with molecules generated during RL training, particularly those where the surrogate shows high error compared to full MD validation. Addressing data availability [Key Challenge 4].
    *   **Target Data:** We will select 1-2 well-characterized protein targets (e.g., a kinase like EGFR or a GPCR like DRD2 [3]) with known inhibitors to facilitate bioactivity prediction and binding energy calculations.

*   **Experimental Design and Validation:**
    *   **Baselines:** To demonstrate the superiority of PIRL, we will compare against:
        1.  *RL-Chem:* Standard GNN-based RL generator optimizing only chemical properties and predicted activity (similar to [3] but using GNN).
        2.  *Gen-Filter:* Generate molecules using RL-Chem, then apply post-hoc filtering using full MD simulations (representing common practice).
        3.  *Existing Physics-Informed Methods:* If available and comparable, benchmark against methods like [8] or conceptually similar work if implementations exist.
    *   **Tasks:**
        1.  *Targeted Generation:* Generate molecules optimized for activity against a specific protein target (e.g., DRD2) while maximizing physical stability and drug-likeness.
        2.  *Property Optimization:* Generate molecules maximizing a combination of QED and physical stability score, aiming for novel scaffolds.
    *   **Evaluation Metrics:** Performance will be assessed comprehensively:
        *   *Generation Quality:*
            *   Validity (%): Percentage of chemically valid molecules generated.
            *   Novelty (%): Percentage of generated molecules not present in the training set.
            *   Uniqueness (%): Percentage of unique molecules among the valid generated ones.
            *   Diversity: Internal diversity (e.g., Tanimoto similarity distribution) and external diversity (similarity to known actives/reference sets).
        *   *Property Optimization:*
            *   Distribution of optimized properties (QED, SA, LogP, predicted activity). Compare distributions achieved by PIRL vs. baselines.
            *   Score Improvement: Average score (reward component) achieved for target properties.
        *   *Physical Plausibility:*
            *   Stability (%): Percentage of top-k generated molecules deemed stable by *full* MD validation (e.g., RMSD < 2Å over 5ns). This is a key metric.
            *   Binding Affinity: Distribution of predicted binding affinities (from surrogate and full MD/docking for top candidates). Compare correlation between surrogate and full MD.
        *   *Efficiency:*
            *   Computational Cost: Number of full MD simulations required (compare PIRL's sparse use vs. Gen-Filter's exhaustive use). Training time.
            *   Hit Rate Improvement: Estimate the increase in the proportion of generated molecules that pass the physical stability filter compared to baselines. This translates to the estimated reduction in experimental cycles.

    2.  **High-quality molecular candidates:** Demonstration that PIRL generates a significantly higher proportion of molecules that are simultaneously chemically valid, novel, diverse, possess desired drug-like properties, exhibit predicted bioactivity, AND are physically stable (quantified by full MD validation) compared to baseline methods. We anticipate achieving the target of 30-50% reduction in simulation-driven filtering effort by improving the intrinsic physical quality of generated candidates.
    3.  **Efficient and accurate MD surrogate:** A trained surrogate model capable of predicting key MD properties (stability, binding proxies) with quantifiable accuracy (e.g., >85% accuracy for stability classification, high correlation R^2 > 0.7 for energy proxies) at a fraction (e.g., <0.1%) of the computational cost of full MD simulations.
    4.  **Adaptive reward mechanism insights:** Analysis of the adaptive reward balancing strategy, providing insights into how best to combine chemical and physical objectives during molecular generation.
    5.  **Open-source contribution:** Release of the PIRL framework code and potentially the MD surrogate training data/models to benefit the research community.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Transforming Drug Discovery:** This research has the potential to significantly impact the early stages of drug discovery. By generating more physically realistic molecular candidates, PIRL can reduce the high attrition rates associated with poor pharmacokinetic properties, shorten development timelines, and lower costs. This directly contributes to the goal of accelerating the drug discovery pipeline.
    *   **Advancing AI for Science:** The project advances the frontier of AI by developing methods that incorporate fundamental physical principles into generative processes. It provides a concrete example of how AI can move beyond data patterns to leverage domain knowledge (physics) for more robust and meaningful scientific discovery. This aligns perfectly with the core themes of the AI for Science Workshop, particularly incorporating physical insights and tackling grand challenges in structural biology and molecular modeling.
    *   **New Research Directions:** Success in this project will open avenues for incorporating more complex physical phenomena (e.g., quantum mechanical effects [6], solvation dynamics, predicted ADMET properties) into generative AI models, further refining the *de novo* design process. The methodology for surrogate modeling and adaptive rewards could be applicable to other scientific domains involving expensive simulations.
    *   **Interdisciplinary Synergy:** This work strengthens the connection between machine learning, computational chemistry, and biophysics, fostering collaboration and leading to novel solutions that leverage the strengths of each field.
