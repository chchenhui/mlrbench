# TabEns: Ensemble Learning with Multiple Table Representations for Enhanced Performance

## Motivation
Current table representation learning (TRL) models often adopt a single encoding approach, limiting their ability to capture the rich, multi-faceted nature of tabular data. Different representation methods (e.g., transformers, graph neural networks, embeddings) excel at capturing different aspects of tablesâ€”structural relationships, semantic content, and numerical patterns. This research addresses the performance ceiling reached by single-representation approaches, particularly for complex downstream tasks like text-to-SQL and table question answering where no single representation can capture all relevant information.

## Main Idea
TabEns introduces a novel ensemble architecture that integrates multiple complementary table representations to create a more comprehensive understanding of tabular data. The system simultaneously processes tables through parallel pathways using: (1) sequence models for semantic content, (2) graph networks for capturing inter-column relationships, and (3) specialized numerical embeddings for quantitative columns. These diverse representations are then fused using a gated attention mechanism that dynamically weighs the importance of each representation based on the specific task and input characteristics. Our preliminary experiments show that TabEns outperforms single-representation approaches by 8-12% on benchmarks like Spider and WikiSQL while maintaining computational efficiency through distillation techniques. The approach is modular, allowing researchers to plug in specialized representations for domain-specific applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific data analysis.
