**SynthTab: A Multi-Agent Framework for Constraint-Aware and Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Tabular Data Generation Using Large Language Models**

---

## 2. Introduction  

### Background  
Tabular data dominates real-world applications, from enterprise analytics to medical databases, yet two critical challenges persist: **data scarcity** (e.g., rare events in healthcare) and **privacy restrictions** (e.g., GDPR compliance in finance). While synthetic data generation offers a solution, existing methods—such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and traditional statistical models—often fail to enforce schema constraints (e.g., referential integrity) or preserve domain semantics, leading to invalid or unrealistic samples. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for tabular data synthesis due to their ability to capture complex feature relationships. However, LLMs alone struggle with explicit constraint enforcement and privacy risks.  

### Research Objectives  
This research proposes **SynthTab**, a novel framework that integrates LLMs with multi-agent validation and differential privacy to generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data. The objectives are:  
1. Develop a retrieval-augmented LLM for context-aware tabular data generation.  
2. Design a **Schema Validator** agent to enforce structural and semantic constraints.  
3. Integrate a **Quality Assessor** agent to evaluate synthetic data utility and provide iterative refinement.  
4. Apply differential privacy (DP) mechanisms to minimize privacy leakage.  
5. Validate SynthTab on real-world datasets across domains (e.g., finance, healthcare) and tasks (e.g., classification, data sharing).  

### Significance  
SynthTab addresses three gaps in synthetic tabular data generation:  
- **Constraint Ignorance**: Existing tools like HARMONIC (Wang et al., 2024) and TabuLa (Zhao et al., 2023) focus on feature correlations but neglect schema rules.  
- **Privacy-Utility Trade-off**: Prior work (Doe & Smith, 2023; Brown & Green, 2024) applies DP but struggles to balance privacy with data realism.  
- **Evaluation Fragmentation**: Current metrics (e.g., KL divergence) fail to holistically assess constraint compliance and downstream task performance.  

By combining LLMs with domain-specific validation and privacy preservation, SynthTab aims to enable safer data sharing and more robust model training in low-resource settings.

## 3. Methodology  

### Research Design  
**SynthTab** operates in four stages (Figure 1):  
1. **Retrieval-Augmented LLM Generation**: Generate candidate rows using an instruction-tuned LLM.  
2. **Schema Validation**: Enforce structural and semantic constraints.  
3. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate synthetic data fidelity and utility.  
4. **Differential Privacy**: Apply noise to sensitive attributes.  

#### Stage 1: Retrieval-Augmented LLM Generation  
- **Data Preparation**: Use publicly available tabular datasets (e.g., UCI Adult, MIMIC-III) with defined schemas.  
- **LLM Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune an open-source LLM (e.g., LLaMA-3) on tabular data using a permutation-based strategy (Nguyen et al., 2024) to capture multi-column dependencies.  
- **Prompt Engineering**: For each row generation, retrieve the $k$ most similar rows from the training data using cosine similarity on column embeddings. Construct a prompt:  
  ```  
  "Generate a valid row for a [domain] dataset. Schema: [Column A: Type, Constraints; ...]. Examples: {retrieved_rows}. Output:"  
  ```  
- **Decoding**: Use nucleus sampling ($p=0.95$) to balance diversity and coherence.  

#### Stage 2: Schema Validation Agent  
The agent enforces five constraint classes via chain-of-thought verification:  
1. **Data Types**: Validate using regex (e.g., `\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4}` for dates).  
2. **Uniqueness**: For columns marked `UNIQUE`, ensure no duplicates exist:  
   $$ \forall x_i, x_j \in X_{\text{synth}}, x_i[c] \neq x_j[c] $$  
3. **Referential Integrity**: For foreign keys, check against reference tables:  
   $$ x_{\text{new}}[c_{\text{FK}}] \in \{x[c_{\text{PK}}] \mid x \in X_{\text{ref}}\} $$  
4. **Business Rules**: Enforce domain logic (e.g., `age` > 18 for loan applicants).  
5. **Statistical Bounds**: Ensure numerical values lie within $\mu \pm 3\sigma$ of the original data.  

Invalid rows trigger regeneration with error-specific feedback (e.g., "Adjust `age` to ≥18").  

#### Stage 3: Quality Assessor Agent  
The agent evaluates synthetic data on three metrics:  
1. **Statistical Similarity**: Compute Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) for each column:  
   $$ \text{JSD}(P_{\text{orig}} \parallel P_{\text{synth}}) = \frac{1}{2} D_{\text{KL}}(P_{\text{orig}} \parallel M) + \frac{1}{2} D_{\text{KL}}(P_{\text{synth}} \parallel M), $$  
   where $M = \frac{1}{2}(P_{\text{orig}} + P_{\text{synth}})$.  
2. **Downstream Utility**: Train ML models (e.g., XGBoost) on synthetic data and test on real holdout data; report accuracy/F1.  
3. **Constraint Violation Rate**: Fraction of rows failing schema checks.  

Results are fed back to the LLM to adjust prompts (e.g., “Increase emphasis on column X correlations”).  

#### Stage 4: Differential Privacy (DP) Integration  
Apply DP to categorical and numerical attributes:  
- **Categorical**: Use the exponential mechanism to sample values with probability proportional to $e^{-\epsilon \cdot \text{sensitivity}/2}$.  
- **Numerical**: Add Laplace noise with scale $\lambda = \Delta f / \epsilon$, where $\Delta f$ is the L1 sensitivity.  

### Experimental Design  
**Datasets**: Evaluate on 10 public datasets (e.g., Credit Scoring, Hospital Readmissions) spanning healthcare, finance, and retail.  

**Baselines**: Compare against HARMONIC (Wang et al., 2024), TabuLa (Zhao et al., 2023), DP-GAN (Brown & Green, 2024), and GPT-4.  

**Metrics**:  
- **Statistical Fidelity**: JSD, Wasserstein distance.  
- **Constraint Compliance**: Violation rate (%).  
- **Privacy**: $\epsilon$-DP guarantee, membership inference attack success rate.  
- **Utility**: Downstream task accuracy, AUC-ROC.  

**Validation**: Perform 5-fold cross-validation, paired t-tests ($\alpha=0.05$), and ablation studies on agent contributions.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Expected Outcomes  
1. **Improved Fidelity**: SynthTab will reduce JSD by ≥15% over HARMONIC and constraint violations by ≥30% versus GPT-4.  
2. **Robust Privacy**: Achieve $\epsilon \leq 1.0$ with <5% degradation in downstream accuracy.  
3. **Domain Adaptation**: Demonstrate successful deployment in enterprise (sales forecasting) and medical (patient readmission) workflows.  

### Impact  
- **Data Scarcity Mitigation**: Enable low-resource applications (e.g., rare disease prediction).  
- **Safe Data Sharing**: Facilitate GDPR-compliant data publishing for collaborative research.  
- **TRL Advancement**: Introduce a benchmark for constraint-aware synthesis, influencing standards in federated learning and data governance.  

SynthTab bridges the gap between LLMs’ generative power and the intricate requirements of real-world tabular data, paving the way for reliable, ethical, and scalable synthetic data solutions.
