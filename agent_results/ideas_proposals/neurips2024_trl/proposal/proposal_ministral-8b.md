SynthTab – LLM-Driven Synthetic Tabular Data with Constraint-Aware Generation

## 2. Introduction

### Background

Tabular data is ubiquitous in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and enterprise management. However, data scarcity and privacy restrictions often hinder the development and deployment of machine learning models. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges, offering a realistic and privacy-preserving alternative to real-world data. Existing methods, however, often struggle with schema compliance, privacy preservation, and capturing complex dependencies within the data. Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in generating realistic text and code, but their application to tabular data remains under-explored.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop SynthTab, a multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data. The framework will incorporate schema-aware validation, privacy mechanisms, and iterative refinement to produce constraint-compliant, realistic, and privacy-preserving synthetic datasets. Specifically, the research aims to:

1. Design and implement a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that uses LLMs to propose candidate rows reflecting real distributions and domain vocabularies.
2. Develop a Schema Validator agent to enforce data types, uniqueness, referential integrity, and business rules via chain-of-thought verification.
3. Integrate a Quality Assessor to measure similarity to original data and downstream model performance, feeding corrective signals back to the LLM in iterative refinements.
4. Implement differential privacy techniques to bound information leakage and ensure privacy preservation.
5. Evaluate the effectiveness of SynthTab in low-data regimes, downstream model training, and domain-specific applications.

### Significance

The proposed SynthTab framework addresses the critical challenges in synthetic tabular data generation, offering a practical pipeline that enforces integrity, preserves statistical properties, and respects privacy. By unlocking better data augmentation and safer data sharing, SynthTab can significantly advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine learning and support various applications, from data preparation and analysis to model training and evaluation.

### 3.1 Data Collection

The dataset used in this research will consist of real-world tabular data from various domains, such as finance, healthcare, and enterprise management. The data will be anonymized to ensure privacy and will include schema information, column statistics, and any relevant domain knowledge.

### 3.2 Algorithmic Steps

#### 3.2.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation with LLM

The LLM will be fine-tuned on a dataset of tabular data and associated prompts to generate candidate rows. The retrieval-augmented generation process will involve:

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Designing prompts that guide the LLM to generate rows that reflect real distributions and domain vocabularies.
2. **Candidate Generation**: Using the fine-tuned LLM to generate candidate rows based on the prompts.
3. **Retrieval**: Retrieving relevant data samples from the original dataset to enhance the generation process.

#### 3.2.2 Schema Validation with Chain-of-Thought Verification

The Schema Validator agent will enforce data types, uniqueness, referential integrity, and business rules via chain-of-thought verification. This process will involve:

1. **Data Type Enforcement**: Ensuring that each generated row adheres to the specified data types.
2. **Uniqueness Enforcement**: Checking that each generated row is unique within the dataset.
3. **Referential Integrity Enforcement**: Ensuring that foreign key constraints are satisfied.
4. **Business Rule Enforcement**: Validating that the generated rows adhere to any predefined business rules.

#### 3.2.3 Quality Assessment and Iterative Refinement

The Quality Assessor will measure the similarity of the generated data to the original dataset and downstream model performance. This process will involve:

1. **Similarity Measurement**: Calculating the similarity between the generated data and the original dataset using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or cosine similarity.
2. **Downstream Model Performance**: Evaluating the performance of downstream models trained on the generated data.
3. **Corrective Signals**: Feeding corrective signals back to the LLM based on the similarity measurements and model performance.

#### 3.2.4 Differential Privacy

To ensure privacy preservation, differential privacy techniques will be employed. This process will involve:

1. **Noise Addition**: Adding noise to the generated data to prevent information leakage.
2. **Privacy Budget Management**: Controlling the amount of noise added to balance data utility and privacy.

### 3.3 Experimental Design

The effectiveness of SynthTab will be evaluated using a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. The experimental design will involve:

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Comparing the performance of SynthTab with state-of-the-art synthetic data generation methods.
2. **Downstream Task Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of downstream models trained on the generated data.
3. **Privacy Analysis**: Evaluating the privacy guarantees provided by SynthTab using metrics such as differential privacy.
4. **User Study**: Conducting a user study to assess the usability and practicality of SynthTab in real-world scenarios.

### 3.4 Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation metrics will include:

1. **Data Quality Metrics**: Mean squared error (MSE), cosine similarity, and other relevant metrics to measure the similarity between the generated data and the original dataset.
2. **Downstream Task Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of downstream models trained on the generated data.
3. **Privacy Metrics**: Differential privacy guarantees and other relevant metrics to assess the privacy preservation of the generated data.
4. **Usability Metrics**: User satisfaction and ease of use to evaluate the practicality of SynthTab in real-world scenarios.
