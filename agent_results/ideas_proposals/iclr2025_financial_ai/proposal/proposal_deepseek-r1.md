### 2. **Introduction**  

#### **Background**  
The financial industry’s reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) has grown exponentially, with applications ranging from fraud detection to algorithmic trading. However, access to high-quality financial data for training AI models is hindered by regulatory constraints (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and data sensitivity. Existing synthetic data generation methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), struggle to capture the complex temporal dependencies and domain-specific constraints inherent in financial time-series data. For instance, synthetic data may violate anti-money laundering (AML) rules or fail to replicate volatility clustering patterns, limiting their utility in downstream tasks like risk modeling.  

Recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) show promise for generating high-fidelity time-series data by iteratively denoising random noise into structured sequences. However, these models often lack mechanisms to enforce domain-specific constraints, such as regulatory compliance or causal market relationships. Integrating domain knowledge into the generation process is critical to ensure synthetic data validity and practical utility.  

#### **Research Objectives**  
This research aims to develop a hybrid framework that combines **diffusion models** with **domain-specific knowledge graphs** to generate synthetic financial time-series data. The objectives are:  
1. **Model Development**: Design a diffusion model guided by a knowledge graph encoding financial rules, temporal dependencies, and causal relationships.  
2. **Constraint Adherence**: Ensure synthetic data complies with regulatory and market dynamics (e.g., liquidity constraints, fraud patterns).  
3. **Evaluation**: Validate the framework’s performance in terms of statistical fidelity, constraint satisfaction, and downstream task utility (e.g., fraud detection).  

#### **Significance**  
The proposed framework addresses critical gaps in synthetic financial data generation:  
- **Privacy Preservation**: Enable AI research without exposing sensitive real-world data.  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Embed domain knowledge to ensure synthetic data adheres to financial regulations.  
- **Democratization of Data**: Facilitate open research by providing customizable, high-fidelity datasets.  

This work aligns with the workshop’s focus on responsible AI by prioritizing compliance, transparency, and ethical data usage.

### 3. **Methodology**  

#### **3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
- **Datasets**: Use publicly available financial time-series datasets (e.g., stock prices from Yahoo Finance, transaction logs from IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection) and proprietary data (subject to partnerships).  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Normalize numerical features (e.g., min-max scaling).  
  - Encode categorical variables (e.g., transaction types) using embeddings.  
  - Segment time series into sliding windows of fixed length (e.g., 30-day windows for stock prices).  

#### **3.2 Knowledge Graph Construction**  
- **Domain Knowledge Sources**:  
  - **Regulatory Rules**: AML thresholds, transaction limits.  
  - **Market Dynamics**: Correlations between asset classes, macroeconomic indicators.  
  - **Causal Relationships**: E.g., interest rate changes → bond price fluctuations.  
- **Graph Structure**:  
  - Nodes: Financial entities (assets, users, institutions), regulatory constraints.  
  - Edges: Temporal dependencies (e.g., lagged correlations), causal links, and rule-based relationships.  
- **Implementation**: Use Neo4j or PyTorch Geometric for graph representation.  

#### **3.3 Model Architecture**  
The framework combines a **diffusion model** with a **graph neural network (GNN)** to guide the generation process (Figure 1).  

**3.3.1 Diffusion Process**  
- **Forward Process**: Gradually add Gaussian noise to real data over $T$ timesteps:  
  $$q(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t} \mathbf{x}_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I}),$$  
  where $\beta_t$ is the noise schedule.  
- **Reverse Process**: Learn to denoise data using a GNN-conditioned diffusion model:  
  $$p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathcal{G}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t, \mathcal{G}), \Sigma_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t, \mathcal{G})),$$  
  where $\mathcal{G}$ is the knowledge graph, and $\mu_\theta$, $\Sigma_\theta$ are learned by the GNN.  

**3.3.2 Graph Neural Network (GNN) Integration**  
- **Graph Attention Network (GAT)**: Processes the knowledge graph to generate node embeddings that capture regulatory and temporal constraints.  
- **Cross-Attention Mechanism**: At each denoising step, the diffusion model’s U-Net attends to GNN embeddings to adjust the generation process.  

#### **3.4 Training Process**  
- **Loss Function**: Combines the standard diffusion loss with a graph-based regularization term:  
  $$\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{t, \mathbf{x}_0, \epsilon} \left[ \|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t, \mathcal{G})\|^2 \right] + \lambda \cdot \text{CR}(\mathbf{x}_0, \mathcal{G}),$$  
  where $\text{CR}(\cdot)$ penalizes constraint violations (e.g., transactions exceeding AML thresholds) using a rule-checking module.  
- **Optimization**: AdamW optimizer with learning rate decay.  

#### **3.5 Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against state-of-the-art methods:  
  - **FinDiff** (diffusion model for tabular data).  
  - **TimeAutoDiff** (VAE-diffusion hybrid).  
  - **TransFusion** (transformer-based diffusion).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  1. **Statistical Fidelity**:  
     - Wasserstein distance between real and synthetic data distributions.  
     - Autocorrelation similarity for temporal dependencies.  
  2. **Constraint Adherence**:  
     - **Constraint Violation Rate (CVR)**: % of synthetic samples violating domain rules.  
  3. **Downstream Task Performance**:  
     - Train fraud detection/risk models on synthetic data; evaluate AUC-ROC on real test data.  
- **Ablation Studies**: Test contributions of the knowledge graph and GNN components.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

#### **Expected Outcomes**  
1. **High-Fidelity Synthetic Data**: The framework will generate time-series data that statistically mirrors real financial datasets (e.g., preserving volatility clustering).  
2. **Improved Constraint Adherence**: Synthetic data will exhibit <5% CVR for key regulatory rules (e.g., transaction limits).  
3. **Enhanced Downstream Models**: Fraud detection models trained on synthetic data will achieve AUC-ROC scores within 5% of models trained on real data.  

#### **Impact**  
- **Democratizing Financial AI Research**: Open-source synthetic datasets will enable researchers without data access to innovate responsibly.  
- **Privacy-Compliant Innovation**: Financial institutions can prototype AI models without legal risks.  
- **Regulatory Alignment**: The knowledge graph framework provides a blueprint for compliance-aware AI development.  

This work will directly address the workshop’s themes of innovation and responsible AI, fostering collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders.
