**Title:** Generative Counterfactual Explanations for Algorithmic Trading Decisions

**Motivation:** Algorithmic trading decisions, especially from complex AI models, often lack transparency. Understanding *why* a trade was executed or avoided is critical for risk management, debugging, regulatory compliance, and building trust. Current explanation methods can be insufficient for sequential, high-frequency decisions.

**Main Idea:** We propose developing a generative model capable of producing counterfactual explanations for trading agent decisions. Given a specific trading decision (e.g., buy/sell/hold at time *t*), the model would generate the minimal, realistic perturbation to the input market state (e.g., recent price series, order book data) that would have resulted in a different decision. This involves training a conditional generative model (e.g., a conditional VAE or GAN) alongside the trading agent, specifically optimized to generate plausible market scenarios leading to alternative outcomes. The generated counterfactuals provide concrete insights into the agent's sensitivity to specific market features, enhancing interpretability and allowing for more robust agent evaluation and refinement.
