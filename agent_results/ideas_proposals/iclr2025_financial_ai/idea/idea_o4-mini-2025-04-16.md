Title: Diffusion-Driven Synthetic Market Scenarios for Robust Risk Management

Motivation:  
Financial institutions rely on historical market data to calibrate risk models, yet rare “tail‐event” scenarios are underrepresented. Without realistic stress scenarios, Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) estimates can be dangerously biased, leading to undercapitalization or excessive conservatism. A generative framework that synthesizes plausible extreme events would bolster model reliability and regulatory compliance.

Main Idea:  
We propose a conditional diffusion model that learns joint distributions of multi‐asset time series and macroeconomic covariates. During training, the network ingests rolling windows of price, volatility, and interest‐rate sequences along with external indicators (e.g., VIX, GDP growth). At generation time, users specify stress intensities—such as sudden rate spikes or liquidity droughts—and the model samples coherent synthetic paths reflecting those conditions. These augmented scenarios feed into existing VaR/ES pipelines, improving tail risk estimates. We will evaluate improvement in backtesting failure rates, capital requirement accuracy, and computational efficiency. This approach democratizes stress‐testing, enabling institutions of all sizes to simulate extreme but realistic market dynamics.
