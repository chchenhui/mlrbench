Title  
Adaptive Invariant Feature Extraction via Synthetic Latent Interventions (AIFS)

1. Introduction  
Background  
Deep neural networks excel when training and test data share similar distributions. However, they frequently latch onto spurious correlations—statistically predictive but non‐causal features—due to their simplicity bias and data‐driven inductive priors. This leads to brittle models that fail under distribution shifts, minority group under‐representation, or adversarial conditions. Existing robustification methods often rely on group annotations, manual spurious labels, or increased model complexity, limiting scalability across modalities and real‐world scenarios.

Research Objectives  
This proposal introduces AIFS, a modality‐agnostic framework that (i) automatically discovers hidden spurious latent factors via gradient‐based attribution, (ii) applies synthetic interventions in the latent space to simulate distributional shifts without explicit group labels, and (iii) enforces invariance to these interventions through a dual‐objective training procedure. We aim to demonstrate that AIFS can:  
• Neutralize unknown spurious cues without manual annotation or group labels.  
• Improve worst‐group and out‐of‐distribution (OOD) accuracy on image and tabular benchmarks.  
• Maintain or improve in‐distribution performance while reducing reliance on spurious features.  

Significance  
AIFS advances the foundations and solutions for shortcut learning by:  
• Providing a self‐supervised intervention mechanism that scales to high‐dimensional data.  
• Shedding light on the latent dimensions where spurious features reside.  
• Enabling robust feature learning applicable to supervised, self‐supervised, and multimodal paradigms.  

2. Methodology  
We detail the AIFS design in four subcomponents: encoder architecture, synthetic intervention module, dual‐objective loss formulation, and iterative attribution‐intervention loop. We finish with experimental protocols.

2.1 Model Architecture  
Let $\mathcal{X}$ be the input space and $\mathcal{Y}$ the label set. We assume access to a pretrained encoder $f_\mathrm{enc}:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^d$ that maps each input $x$ to a $d$‐dimensional latent vector $z=f_\mathrm{enc}(x)$. A lightweight classifier head $g:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}$ produces $\hat y = g(z)$. Both $f_\mathrm{enc}$ and $g$ are fine‐tuned in AIFS.

2.2 Synthetic Intervention Module  
We define a trainable mask matrix $M\in[0,1]^{d}$ parameterizing which latent dimensions to perturb. Given $z$, we sample a random noise vector $\delta\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2I_d)$ and construct an intervened latent vector:  
$$
z' = z + M\odot \delta,
$$  
where $\odot$ denotes element‐wise multiplication. During training, $M$ is updated to focus interventions on dimensions identified as spurious.

2.3 Dual‐Objective Loss  
AIFS minimizes a composite loss encouraging (i) classification accuracy on original data, (ii) invariance to latent interventions, and (iii) penalization of over‐reliance on perturbed dimensions. Let $L_\mathrm{cls}(g(z),y)$ be the standard cross‐entropy. We define:  
• Invariance loss  
$$
L_\mathrm{inv} = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y),\,\delta}\bigl[\mathrm{CE}\bigl(g(z'),y\bigr)\bigr],
$$  
penalizing misclassification under intervention.  
• Sensitivity loss  
First compute the gradient‐based sensitivity $s_i(x,y)$ of latent dimension $i$:  
$$
s_i(x,y) = \Bigl\lvert\frac{\partial L_\mathrm{cls}(g(z),y)}{\partial z_i}\Bigr\rvert.
$$  
Given a set $S$ of top‐$k$ sensitive dimensions (highest $s_i$), we define  
$$
L_\mathrm{sens} = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)}\biggl[\sum_{i\in S} s_i(x,y)\biggr].
$$  
The total loss is  
$$
L = L_\mathrm{cls} + \alpha\,L_\mathrm{inv} + \beta\,L_\mathrm{sens},
$$  
where $\alpha,\beta>0$ balance invariance and sensitivity penalties.

2.4 Iterative Attribution–Intervention Loop  
At each intervention round $t$:  
1. Forward pass: compute $z$ and $z'$ for a mini‐batch.  
2. Compute $L_\mathrm{cls},L_\mathrm{inv},L_\mathrm{sens}$; update $f_\mathrm{enc},g,M$ via SGD/Adam.  
3. Attribution: accumulate $\nabla_z L_\mathrm{cls}$ to rank latent dimensions by expected sensitivity.  
4. Update $M$ to emphasize the top‐$m$ sensitive dimensions, increasing their perturbation probability.  

Pseudocode (Algorithm 1):  
```
Initialize f_enc, g, mask M←0.5·1_d
for t←1 to T rounds:
  for each minibatch (x,y):
    z←f_enc(x)
    δ∼N(0,σ^2I), z'←z + M⊙δ
    Compute L_cls,L_inv,L_sens
    Update f_enc,g,M ← optimizer.step(∇L)
  Compute average gradients s̄_i = E[|∂L_cls/∂z_i|]
  Let S_t = top-m indices of s̄
  M[S_t]← clamp(M[S_t]+η,0,1)
end
```
2.5 Implementation Details  
• Encoder: ResNet‐50 for vision or a two‐layer MLP for tabular data.  
• Noise level: $\sigma=0.1$ (tuned via grid search).  
• Hyperparameters: $\alpha,\beta\in\{0.1,1,10\}$; $k=m=20$; learning rate $1e$‐4; batch size 128; training rounds $T=50$.  
• Optimizer: Adam with weight decay $1e$‐5.  

2.6 Experimental Design  
We evaluate AIFS on established spurious‐correlation benchmarks and synthetic datasets:

Datasets  
• Colored MNIST (digit classification with color spuriously correlated with label).  
• Waterbirds (bird classification with background spuriously correlated).  
• CelebA (gender classification with hair color spuriously correlated).  
• Synthetic tabular (constructed with two causal features and two spurious features).  

Baselines  
• ERM (Empirical Risk Minimization)  
• IRM (Invariant Risk Minimization)  
• GroupDRO (Group Distributionally Robust Optimization)  
• Rubi (Prediction‐Residual Bias)  
• SPUME (Spuriousness‐Aware Meta‐Learning)  
• ElRep (Elastic Representation)  

Metrics  
• Overall accuracy on in‐distribution (ID) test set.  
• Worst‐group accuracy (WG‐Acc): minimum accuracy across subpopulations.  
• OOD accuracy under controlled shift of spurious feature distribution.  
• Robustness gap: ID accuracy minus OOD accuracy.  
• Computational overhead: training time relative to ERM.  

Ablation Studies  
• Remove $L_\mathrm{sens}$ or $L_\mathrm{inv}$.  
• Random interventions versus gradient‐guided interventions.  
• Effect of varying $k,m,\alpha,\beta,\sigma$.  
• Modality generalization: test on image, tabular, and text (via BERT embedding).  

Statistical Significance  
We run each experiment with 5 random seeds and report mean ± standard deviation.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Expected Outcomes  
1. Improved Worst‐Group Performance  
   AIFS is expected to outperform ERM and match or exceed IRM, GroupDRO, and SPUME in worst‐group accuracy by 5–10 percentage points on benchmark tasks, while maintaining high overall accuracy.  
2. Reduced Robustness Gap  
   By enforcing invariance to synthetic latent shifts, AIFS should exhibit a <3% drop from ID to OOD accuracy, halving the gap seen in ERM.  
3. Scalability & Modality‐Agnosticism  
   Our experiments across vision, tabular, and text domains will demonstrate that AIFS incurs only 10–20% additional training time compared to ERM, without requiring group labels or manual annotation.  
4. Insight into Latent Spurious Directions  
   The gradient attribution logs will reveal consistent sets of latent dimensions responsible for spurious features, offering a diagnostic tool for model auditing.

Impact  
• Theoretically, AIFS advances our understanding of how synthetic interventions in latent spaces can emulate distributional shifts and enforce causal feature learning.  
• Practically, it equips practitioners with a plug‐and‐play robustification module that requires no extra supervision, applicable to foundation models and downstream tasks.  
• Societally, by reducing reliance on dataset biases, AIFS can lead to fairer, more reliable AI systems in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving.  
• Methodologically, the attribution–intervention loop may inspire future work in meta‐learning, adversarial training, and causal representation learning.

Conclusion  
This proposal outlines a comprehensive research plan for Adaptive Invariant Feature Extraction using Synthetic Interventions. By combining generative latent perturbations, gradient‐based sensitivity analysis, and a dual‐objective loss, AIFS aims to systematically unlearn spurious correlations and strengthen causal pattern learning. Rigorous evaluation against state‐of‐the‐art methods, ablation studies, and multi‐domain experiments will validate its effectiveness, efficiency, and generality, paving the way toward more robust and trustworthy AI.
