1. Title  
“Intervention-Based Causal Pruning for Spurious Feature Removal in Foundation Models”

2. Introduction  
Background  
Foundation Models (FMs) such as GPT-3/GPT-4 for language and CLIP for vision-language tasks have revolutionized AI by enabling high-quality zero- and few-shot learning across diverse domains. However, their reliance on massive, noisy training corpora induces spurious feature learning—hidden activations that correlate with training labels but do not causally drive the true underlying concepts. Such spurious features manifest as nonfactual “hallucinations,” sensitivity to prompt formulations, demographic biases and poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.

Recent work has begun to address these challenges from a causal perspective. Zhou & Zhu (2024) introduce a causally calibrated robust classifier (CCR) to reweight features via counterfactual reasoning. Ma et al. (2024) propose a test-time prompt tuning method, SEraser, to attenuate spurious visual features in CLIP. Wang et al. (2021) apply manual causal regularization to penalize known spurious tokens. Volodin et al. (2020) incentivize intervention-based exploration in reinforcement learning. These studies underscore (1) the promise of causal interventions to reveal spurious factors and (2) the need for scalable, automated pipelines for FMs.

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop and validate a two-stage, fully automated pipeline—Intervention-Based Causal Pruning (ICCP)—to identify, quantify and remove spurious features in large FMs. The specific objectives are:  
• Design targeted interventions on hidden activations (“do-operations”) to compute each feature’s causal effect on key model behaviors (factuality, sentiment accuracy, bias).  
• Define a spuriousness score using intervention outcomes that flags features whose manipulation induces erratic or harmful outputs.  
• Implement a pruning + reweighting fine-tuning procedure that attenuates or removes high-spuriousness features via contrastive invariance losses.  
• Empirically validate ICCP on open-domain question answering (QA), sentiment analysis under domain shift and bias benchmarks, quantifying gains in hallucination reduction, calibration and fairness.

Significance  
A general, domain-agnostic causal pipeline for spurious feature removal will (1) improve reliability by reducing nonfactual outputs, (2) enhance fairness by attenuating features that amplify demographic biases, and (3) boost transparency by exposing which internal factors drive undesirable behaviors. By grounding interventions in causal theory and automating their application at FM scale, ICCP can establish new best practices for responsible AI.

3. Methodology  
We propose a two-stage intervention-driven pipeline: 3.1 Causal Attribution via Interventions; 3.2 Intervention-Guided Pruning & Reweighting; 3.3 Experimental Design & Evaluation Metrics.

3.1 Stage 1: Causal Attribution via Targeted Interventions  
Data Collection  
• Select pre-trained foundation models: a large language model (e.g., GPT-3.5) and a vision-language model (e.g., CLIP).  
• Curate evaluation sets for each downstream task:  
 – Open-domain QA: Natural Questions, TriviaQA.  
 – Sentiment under shift: train on IMDB, test on Amazon reviews.  
 – Bias benchmarks: e.g., StereoSet, BiasInBios.

Feature Extraction  
From each FM, extract a set of hidden activations (features) $\{F_i\}_{i=1}^N$ at selected layers (e.g., last two transformer layers). Each $F_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$ corresponds to one activation channel.

Interventions (“do-Calculations”)  
For each feature $F_i$, perform the following interventions on a batch of examples $\{x_j\}$ and record the model’s output $y_j$:  
  1. Masking: set $F_i\leftarrow\mathbf{0}$.  
  2. Scaling: set $F_i\leftarrow \alpha\,F_i$ for $\alpha\in\{0,0.5,2\}$.  
  3. Swapping: replace $F_i$ in input $x_j$ with its value from another sample $x_k$.  

These interventions approximate Pearl’s do-operator $\text{do}(F_i=\cdot)$. For each intervention type $t$ and output metric $c$ (e.g., factuality score, sentiment correctness), compute the average causal effect:  
$$
\Delta_{i,t}^{(c)} \;=\;\mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mathcal{D}_c}\bigl[\,m_c(\text{do}_t(F_i);x)-m_c(x)\bigr],
$$  
where $m_c(x)$ is the model’s confidence or correctness for criterion $c$.  

Spuriousness Scoring  
Aggregate intervention effects into a single spuriousness score $s_i$:  
$$
s_i \;=\;\max_{t,c}\;\Bigl|\Delta_{i,t}^{(c)}\Bigr|.
$$  
Intuition: large $|s_i|$ indicates that small perturbations of $F_i$ cause large output swings—hallmark of spurious features.

3.2 Stage 2: Intervention-Guided Pruning & Reweighting  
Feature Pruning  
Define a threshold $\tau$; prune features with $s_i>\tau$ by zeroing their projection weights in the FM:  
$$
w_i \leftarrow 
\begin{cases}
0, & s_i>\tau,\\
w_i, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$  
We implement pruning via a mask vector $\mathbf{m}$ applied to the FM’s weight tensor.

Contrastive Reweighting Fine-Tuning  
To further discourage reliance on moderate spurious features, we fine-tune the pruned model with a contrastive invariance loss. For each original sample $x$ and its intervened counterpart $x'$, we enforce representation invariance at the final layer:  
$$
L_{\text{inv}} \;=\;\sum_{i\,:\,s_i\le\tau}\Bigl\|h(x)_{\!i}-h(x')_{\!i}\Bigr\|^2,
$$  
where $h(x)_i$ is the activation of feature $i$ at the last hidden layer. The total fine-tuning objective is:  
$$
L = L_{\text{task}} + \lambda_{\text{inv}}\,L_{\text{inv}} + \lambda_{\ell_1}\sum_{i}s_i\,|w_i|,
$$  
with $L_{\text{task}}$ the standard cross-entropy or span-prediction loss and hyperparameters $\lambda_{\text{inv}},\lambda_{\ell_1}$ balancing invariance and sparsity. The $\ell_1$ penalty weighted by $s_i$ encourages additional shrinkage of borderline spurious features.

Algorithm Outline  
1. Load pre-trained FM and freeze most parameters.  
2. Extract activations $\{F_i\}$ and compute spuriousness scores $s_i$ via interventions.  
3. Apply mask pruning $w_i\leftarrow 0$ if $s_i>\tau$.  
4. Fine-tune masked FM on task data with $L$ above.  
5. Evaluate on held-out and OOD benchmarks; compute metrics.

3.3 Experimental Design & Evaluation Metrics  
Experimental Conditions  
• Baselines: original FM; test-time prompt tuning (SEraser); CCR (Zhou & Zhu, 2024).  
• Variants: pruning only; pruning + reweighting; varying $\tau$.  

Evaluation Metrics  
– Hallucination Rate: fraction of QA instances with nonfactual answers (assessed by human or automatic fact checkers).  
– Task Accuracy: exact match and F1 on QA; classification accuracy on sentiment.  
– Calibration: Expected Calibration Error (ECE).  
– Fairness: demographic parity difference and equalized odds difference on bias benchmarks.  
– OOD Generalization Gap: difference between in-domain and OOD accuracy.  

Statistical Analysis  
Perform paired t-tests and bootstrap confidence intervals (95%) to assess significance of improvements. Report compute cost overhead for intervention stage.

4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate that ICCP will deliver the following outcomes:  
• Hallucination Reduction: at least 20% relative decrease in nonfactual outputs on open-domain QA.  
• Calibration Improvement: 10–15% reduction in ECE across tasks, indicating more reliable confidence estimates.  
• Fairness Gains: 20–30% reduction in demographic parity difference on bias benchmarks.  
• OOD Robustness: 15% smaller generalization gap under domain shifts in sentiment analysis.  

Impact on Responsible AI  
• Generalizability: By treating hidden activations as causal variables, ICCP applies across modalities and tasks without manual feature engineering.  
• Transparency: Spuriousness scores $s_i$ provide interpretable measures of each feature’s reliability.  
• Ethics and Fairness: Automated pruning of harmful features reduces unintentional biases, aligning FMs closer to human values.  
• Best Practices: The pipeline—comprising intervention design, spuriousness quantification and contrastive fine-tuning—can form a blueprint for future reliable FM development.  

Broader Implications  
• Industry Adoption: ICCP can be integrated into FM fine-tuning toolkits at major AI labs and cloud AI services.  
• Regulatory Compliance: Quantitative spuriousness metrics align with emerging AI governance frameworks requiring demonstrable reliability assessments.  
• Research Directions: Opens avenues for theoretical analysis of causal identifiability in deep nets and for domain-specific intervention designs in areas like clinical health and drug discovery.
