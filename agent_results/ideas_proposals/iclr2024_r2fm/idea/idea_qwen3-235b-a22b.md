**Title:** Causal Intervention in Pre-Training for Reliable Foundation Models: Eliminating Spurious Biases and Enhancing Invariance  

**Motivation:**  
Foundation models often inherit spurious correlations from training data, leading to unreliable behaviors like hallucinations, bias amplification, and sensitivity to irrelevant features. These issues undermine trust in critical applications (e.g., healthcare, finance) and exacerbate societal inequities. While post-hoc fixes exist, addressing spurious biases during pre-training—when models learn foundational representations—could yield systemic improvements in reliability and fairness.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose integrating causal inference into pre-training to learn invariant, causally grounded representations. Our method involves: (1) Constructing counterfactual data augmentations to expose and penalize spurious dependencies (e.g., gender-stereotyped language or texture-based object recognition). (2) Modifying training objectives to prioritize causal features (e.g., semantic context over superficial patterns) via adversarial learning. (3) Introducing a dynamic "bias-detection" module that identifies and suppresses overconfidence in spurious correlations during inference. We will evaluate the approach on benchmarks measuring robustness to distribution shifts, fairness, and factual consistency. Expected outcomes include models with reduced reliance on spurious features, improved generalization, and greater transparency in decision-making. This work could establish a framework for causally aware pre-training, enabling foundation models to align more closely with human values and domain-specific reliability requirements across fields like medicine and education.
