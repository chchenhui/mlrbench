Title: Chain-of-Evidence: A Graph-Augmented Self-Consistency Framework for LLM Truthfulness

Motivation:  
LLMs often hallucinate because they lack an explicit mechanism to verify and aggregate evidence. By structuring retrieval, reasoning, and validation into a unified pipeline, we can dramatically reduce misinformation and bolster user trust—especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare or law.

Main Idea:  
1. Retrieval & Hypothesis Generation: For each query, retrieve top-k passages and prompt the LLM to produce multiple answer hypotheses, each annotated with cited evidence spans.  
2. Evidence Graph Construction: Convert citations into a directed graph where nodes represent factual claims and edges capture argumentative or temporal relations.  
3. Self-Consistency Scoring: Compute a coherence score for each hypothesis based on graph metrics (connectivity, cycle-free paths, redundancy).  
4. Selection & Explanation: Select the hypothesis with the highest score and present its evidence graph as an interpretable justification.  
5. Reinforcement Refinement: Use policy gradients to fine-tune the LLM’s sampling strategy, optimizing for graph coherence and answer accuracy.  

Expected outcomes include a significant drop in hallucinations, quantitative trust scores, and transparent, evidence-based explanations—paving the way for more reliable LLM applications.
