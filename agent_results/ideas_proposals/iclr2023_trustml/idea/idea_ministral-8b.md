### Title: Enhancing Trustworthiness of ML Algorithms under Limited Data and Computation: A Hybrid Approach

### Motivation
The increasing deployment of machine learning (ML) algorithms in sensitive domains necessitates a robust understanding of their trustworthiness, especially under limited data and computational constraints. This research aims to address the challenges posed by statistical and computational limitations, ensuring that ML algorithms remain reliable, fair, and interpretable.

### Main Idea
This research proposes a hybrid approach that combines semi-supervised learning (SSL) with model compression techniques to enhance the trustworthiness of ML algorithms under limited data and computation. The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Data Augmentation and SSL:** Employ semi-supervised learning techniques to leverage unlabeled data, thereby reducing the dependency on high-quality labeled data. This approach helps in improving the model's generalization capabilities.

2. **Model Compression:** Utilize model compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to reduce the computational requirements of the ML model. This ensures that the model can be trained and deployed efficiently even on hardware with limited resources.

3. **Fairness and Privacy Enhancements:** Integrate fairness-aware and privacy-preserving techniques into the model to mitigate issues related to disparate impact and private information leakage. This includes using differential privacy methods and fairness-aware loss functions.

4. **Evaluation and Validation:** Conduct extensive evaluations to quantify the trade-offs between computational efficiency and trustworthiness. This includes assessing the model's performance on diverse datasets, measuring fairness metrics, and evaluating the model's robustness and explainability.

The expected outcomes include a more robust and efficient ML pipeline that can operate under limited data and computational constraints while maintaining high trustworthiness. The potential impact includes improved reliability and fairness in high-stakes decision-making processes, ensuring that ML algorithms contribute positively to society.
