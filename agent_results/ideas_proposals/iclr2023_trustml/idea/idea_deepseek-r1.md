**Title:** EfficientTrust: Balancing Computational Constraints and Trustworthiness in ML  

**Motivation:** Computational limitations often force practitioners to sacrifice trustworthiness (fairness, robustness) for efficiency, especially in resource-constrained settings. Understanding and mitigating these trade-offs is crucial for ethical ML deployment in real-world applications like healthcare and autonomous systems.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a framework to analyze trade-offs between computational resources (training time, memory) and trustworthiness metrics (fairness, robustness). We first empirically quantify how reducing compute (e.g., via model simplification, fewer epochs) impacts trustworthiness across diverse datasets. Then, we develop adaptive algorithms that prioritize compute allocation to trust-critical components. For instance, a dynamic training scheduler that selectively applies fairness regularization or adversarial training based on resource availability and model state. Theoretical analysis will explore inherent trade-off limits. The outcome includes efficient algorithms and guidelines for deploying trustworthy ML under computation limits, validated on benchmarks like ImageNet and clinical datasets. **Impact:** Enables ethical AI in settings with limited resources, reducing disparities in ML accessibility and reliability.
