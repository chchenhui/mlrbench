# Title  
**Equivariant World Models for Sample-Efficient Robotic Learning**

## Introduction  
Modern robotic systems operate in environments governed by fundamental geometric principles, from the rigid body dynamics of mechanical systems to spatial transformations in navigation tasks. Despite this, most existing world models—used for planning and decision-making in reinforcement learning—fail to explicitly incorporate such geometric structure, leading to excessive sample complexity and poor generalization. The recent convergence of geometric deep learning in machine learning and symmetry-aware neural representations in neuroscience suggests that encoding equivariance to transformations such as rotations, translations, and scaling is a fundamental computational strategy across biological and artificial systems. This proposal explores the construction of equivariant world models—neural architectures that explicitly respect the symmetries of robotic environments—to improve data efficiency, generalization, and robustness in learning-based robotic control.

Recent advances in geometric deep learning have demonstrated that incorporating symmetry priors through group-equivariant neural networks can significantly enhance performance on tasks such as pose estimation and spatial reasoning. In neuroscience, studies have shown that neural circuits in the brain reflect topological and geometric structures of their environment, as seen in grid cell activity and head direction neurons. These insights suggest that symmetry and geometry are core computational principles underlying both biological and artificial intelligence. Within robotics, leveraging these principles may lead to dramatic improvements in sample efficiency—particularly in environments where symmetries constrain the space of possible state transitions. By designing world models that respect environmental symmetries, such as SE(2) or SE(3) transformations, we can ensure that learned representations do not arbitrarily distort under geometric transformations. This allows for more consistent and interpretable planning while reducing the burden of training data.

This proposal contributes to the NeurReps workshop theme by advancing the understanding of geometric structure in neural representations, specifically in embodied AI systems. Prior work has demonstrated the benefits of equivariant policies in robotic manipulation, such as EquivAct (2023), which achieves zero-shot generalization across object rotations and scale variations. Other studies, such as the geometric reinforcement learning framework introduced by G-RL (2022), show improved handling of non-Euclidean data in robotic control tasks. Despite these advances, integrating symmetric world models into reinforcement learning pipelines remains an unsolved challenge. Our proposed approach directly addresses this gap by formalizing a framework for learning equivariant world models, enabling robots to build structured, symmetry-preserving world representations that lead to improved exploration and policy learning.

## Methodology  

To construct equivariant world models for sample-efficient robotic learning, we leverage principles from Lie group symmetry and geometric deep learning. Our model incorporates group-equivariant neural architectures to encode environmental transformations such as rotations, translations, and scaling. The core idea is to enforce symmetry constraints explicitly at the architectural level, ensuring that transitions within the latent space conform to the geometric structure of the environment.  

### Group-Equivariant Neural Network Architecture  

We design our world model using group-equivariant convolutional networks (GCNNs) and steerable convolution kernels, building upon the framework introduced by Cohen and Welling (2016) and further developed in works like *Group Equivariant Convolutional Networks* and *Steerable CNNs*. Let $G$ be a Lie group representing the symmetries of the environment (e.g., SE(2) for rigid 2D transformations or SE(3) for full 3D rotations and translations). A group-equivariant model ensures that applying a transformation $g \in G$ to the input results in an equivalent transformation to the output representation:

$$
f(\pi(g)x) = \rho(g)f(x)
$$

where $\pi(g)$ is the action of the group on the input space, $\rho(g)$ is the corresponding transformation of the output feature space, and $f(x)$ is the neural network function. The function $f(x)$ must be designed such that this equivariance constraint holds across all transformation layers. For instance, in SE(2) or SE(3) symmetry, we implement equivariance in convolutional layers by parameterizing filters with steerable bases that transform consistently under group actions. Specifically, we use $\text{SE}(3)$-equivariant convolution operators, as described in *3D Steerable CNNs* and *SE(3)-Transformers*, to ensure full spatial symmetry in 3D robotic tasks. This allows our world model to preserve consistency in spatial reasoning, even when environments are viewed from different perspectives.  

### Design of the Equivariant World Model  

The equivariant world model is designed as a recurrent framework that predicts environment dynamics and reward, forming a complete world model that can be used in model-based reinforcement learning. Let $s_t$ be the state at time $t$ (e.g., joint positions, sensory observations, or visual inputs). Our world model learns a mapping from sequences of states $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_t$ and actions $a_t$ to predicted next states $\hat{s}_{t+1}$ and rewards $\hat{r}_t$. The architecture consists of three key components:

1. **Equivariant Encoder**: Processes raw observations into a symmetric latent representation. We use Lie group-equivariant convolutional layers followed by symmetry-preserving normalization layers such as group normalization. The encoder maps $s_t$ to a latent vector $e(s_t)$ that transforms consistently under environmental symmetries.

2. **Equivariant Transition Dynamics Model**: Predicts state transitions using recurrent layers with equivariant constraints. Given the latent representation $e(s_t)$ and action $a_t$, the transition function $f_{dyn}(e(s_t), a_t)$ computes $\hat{s}_{t+1}$ using symmetry-preserving recurrence mechanisms. This function is designed to be fully invariant or equivariant under the transformation group $G$, ensuring that if the input observation is transformed, the predicted next state undergoes an equivalent transformation.

3. **Equivariant Reward Model**: Estimates future rewards based on latent symmetry-aware representations. The reward function $f_{reward}(e(s_t))$ predicts the expected reward $\hat{r}_t$, ensuring that symmetry transformations do not arbitrarily alter the reward landscape.

### Implementation Details  

We train the model in simulation using reinforcement learning, incorporating symmetry-aware data augmentation techniques. The network is implemented using PyTorch Geometric and LibCurl libraries, which provide support for SE(3)-equivariant convolutional layers. For action-conditioned state prediction, we integrate equivariant recurrent layers, such as $\text{SE}(3)$-equivariant GRU (EGRU) or $\text{SO}(3)$-equivariant LSTM variants, to process action-state sequences while respecting rotational and translational dependencies. Training follows a two-phase approach: pre-training in simulation using PPO or SAC to learn initial policies, followed by fine-tuning on real-robot data with domain adaptation.

This structured approach ensures that our world model explicitly encodes geometric symmetries, leading to more efficient learning and improved generalization in robotic environments.

## Experimental Design  

To validate the effectiveness of our equivariant world model, we design a series of controlled experiments in both simulated and real-world robotic environments. The goal is to quantify improvements in sample efficiency, generalization, and model consistency under environmental transformations.  

### Experimental Setup  

We test our model in two scenarios: a simulated robotic arm environment and a real-world mobile robot navigation task. The simulated environment consists of a 2D and 3D robot arm manipulating objects with rotational and translational symmetries, mimicking common manipulation tasks such as grasping and object repositioning. In the real-world setting, we deploy the model on a mobile robot navigating in an environment with symmetric structures. Both scenarios are carefully designed to test how well the model preserves equivariance during prediction and planning.  

### Baselines for Comparison  

We compare our equivariant world model against several baseline architectures:

1. **Non-Equivariant CNN + GRU**: A standard convolutional plus recurrent architecture without symmetry constraints.
2. **Transformer-based World Model**: A state-of-the-art attention-based architecture capable of capturing spatial-temporal dependencies but without explicit symmetry priors.
3. **Equivariant Feedforward Encoder (No Recurrence)**: A group-equivariant encoder without recurrent components to test whether symmetry alone suffices for dynamics modeling.
4. **Conventional Model-Based RL**: A standard model-based reinforcement learning architecture trained using SAC or PPO, without explicit geometric constraints.

### Evaluation Metrics  

We measure performance using the following metrics:

- **Sample Efficiency**: Training curves showing learning progress over training steps to assess how quickly the model converges.
- **Generalization to Transformed Environments**: We evaluate model performance on test environments where objects are rotated, translated, or scaled to assess symmetry-aware generalization.
- **Reward Prediction Accuracy**: Mean absolute error between predicted and actual rewards.
- **State Rollout Consistency**: We measure trajectory consistency across different spatial transformations to assess how well the model preserves equivariance during planning.  

Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to determine the contribution of individual components such as group-equivariant layers, recurrent design, and data augmentation.

### Statistical Tests  

To assess statistical significance, we perform pairwise t-tests and compute prediction confidence intervals. We also evaluate symmetry robustness by introducing adversarial transformations to test inputs and measuring model stability under these transformations. This comprehensive evaluation framework allows us to rigorously assess the impact of geometric constraints on world model performance.

### Expected Outcomes and Impact  

This research is expected to demonstrate that embedding symmetry priors into world models significantly improves robotic learning efficiency and generalizability. Drawing on insights from prior work—such as G-RL (2022) and *EquivAct* (2023), which showed how symmetry-aware models outperform classical architectures in object manipulation and continuous control—we hypothesize that enforcing spatial invariance in world models will reduce sample complexity. Specifically, we anticipate faster convergence and superior zero-shot generalization across object translations, rotations, and scale variations.  

Our equivariant world model is expected to outperform classic baselines in simulated robotic manipulation tasks where symmetry is inherent, such as grasping objects from arbitrary orientations. The ability to encode geometric structure in the latent space should allow the model to retain consistency in spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate reward predictions and stable long-term planning. These advantages will be most apparent in tasks where symmetry introduces degeneracies in data—e.g., when multiple object placements yield identical rewards. In such scenarios, a symmetry-aware model can leverage its prior knowledge to identify equivalent configurations without relearning from scratch.  

These advancements will have significant implications for robotics applications in dynamic and unstructured environments such as homes, warehouses, and industrial automation. In household settings, an equivariant world model could enable a robot to adapt to novel object placements without requiring extensive retraining, increasing the viability of service robots. In industrial logistics, robots equipped with geometric world models could autonomously adjust to variations in package orientations, streamlining sorting and manipulation pipelines. Our proposed framework bridges geometric deep learning with embodied intelligence, offering a scalable and principled approach to building efficient, generalizable, and interpretable world models for robotic agents.

## Significance and Future Directions  

This research aligns closely with the core themes of the NeurReps workshop by leveraging symmetry and geometry to bridge computational neuroscience with machine learning. The proposed framework for equivariant world models offers an interpretable mechanism through which AI systems can internalize environmental structure—mirroring the neural representation mechanisms observed in mammalian and invertebrate brains. Studies such as *Kim et al.* (2017) and *Gardner et al.* (2022) have demonstrated that biological neural circuits inherently encode symmetries and topological invariants, supporting the hypothesis that symmetry-preserving computations are fundamental to efficient information processing. By explicitly incorporating these principles into reinforcement learning architectures, our work provides a computational analog of these biological mechanisms, potentially enhancing both learning efficiency and generalization in AI systems.

A key advantage of our approach is its compatibility with a broad class of symmetries and transformation groups, making it widely applicable across embodied AI domains—from robotic navigation and object manipulation to vision-based control in dynamic environments. Furthermore, the principles explored here have immediate relevance to geometric deep learning, reinforcement learning, and topological data analysis. The integration of equivariant neural architectures within world modeling introduces new opportunities for improving reward prediction, uncertainty estimation, and long-term planning. Future directions include extending the framework to incorporate more complex symmetries, such as those arising from topological data analysis and non-local spatial constraints.

Additionally, this work lays the foundation for cross-domain investigations into how neural representations emerge in both artificial and biological systems. By studying how equivariant world models internalize environmental priors, we gain insights into how similar mechanisms may operate in the brain. As research on neuro-symmetries progresses, deeper integration of these findings into AI design promises more principled advances in embodied intelligence. Looking ahead, we plan to explore how our model can be integrated into hierarchical reinforcement learning and how it can be extended to handle non-deterministic transformations and partial observability.
