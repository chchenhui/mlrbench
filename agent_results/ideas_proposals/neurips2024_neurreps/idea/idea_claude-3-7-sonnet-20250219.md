# Leveraging Neural Manifold Structure for Robust World Models

## Motivation
World models in artificial intelligence aim to capture the dynamics of an environment, but often struggle with generalization to novel scenarios. Meanwhile, neuroscience reveals that neural circuits in the brain represent environmental dynamics through low-dimensional manifolds that preserve geometric structure, enabling robust generalization. This research proposes to bridge this gap by developing artificial world models explicitly designed to mirror the geometric properties observed in biological neural representations of dynamics, particularly in sensory and motor regions.

## Main Idea
We propose a framework for equivariant world models that learn and preserve the intrinsic geometric structure of environmental dynamics. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (1) a manifold-constrained architecture that maintains the topological structure of the represented environment across network layers, similar to how motor cortex maintains low-dimensional manifolds; (2) differentiable symmetry discovery modules that automatically identify and leverage symmetries in the environment without explicit supervision; and (3) a novel loss function that penalizes distortions in the geometric relationships between states during prediction. By enforcing these geometric constraints, the model will develop representations that are inherently robust to distributional shifts while requiring fewer parameters than conventional approaches. We hypothesize this approach will yield world models with biological-like generalization capabilities for robotics applications and reinforcement learning tasks.
