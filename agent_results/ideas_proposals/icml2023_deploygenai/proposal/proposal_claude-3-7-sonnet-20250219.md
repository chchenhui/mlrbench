# SAFEGEN: Interpretable Safety Checks for Generative Medical Imaging

## 1. Introduction

### Background
The advent of generative artificial intelligence has revolutionized multiple domains, with particularly promising applications in healthcare and medical imaging. Generative models can potentially address critical challenges in medical imaging, such as data scarcity, by synthesizing realistic medical images for training diagnostic algorithms or augmenting existing datasets. These capabilities could accelerate the development of automated diagnostic tools, enhance medical education, and ultimately improve patient care.

However, deploying generative models in high-stakes medical contexts presents significant challenges. Medical images generated by these models might contain subtle artifacts, anatomical inconsistencies, or unrealistic features that, while visually imperceptible to the untrained eye, could lead to catastrophic consequences when used for diagnostic training or clinical decision-making. Unlike in entertainment applications, where minor imperfections might be acceptable, medical imaging requires exacting standards of accuracy and fidelity.

Current approaches to quality control in generative medical imaging predominantly rely on manual inspection by radiologists or simplistic automated metrics that provide binary assessments without explaining the reasoning behind flagging an image as problematic. This creates a critical gap in the deployment pipeline, as developers lack interpretable feedback to improve their models, and clinicians lack confidence in the safety of generated images.

### Research Objectives
The primary aim of this research is to develop SAFEGEN, a comprehensive framework for automatically assessing the safety and realism of generated medical images with fine-grained interpretability. Specifically, this research seeks to:

1. Design and implement an anomaly detection module capable of identifying unrealistic features or artifacts in synthetically generated CT scans, MRIs, and other medical imaging modalities.

2. Develop an interpretability component that can not only flag problematic regions but also explain why specific features are considered anomalous.

3. Create a medical imaging-specific evaluation taxonomy that categorizes different types of generation artifacts and safety concerns.

4. Validate the framework through rigorous comparison with expert radiologist assessments.

5. Establish deployment protocols that integrate SAFEGEN as a critical safety check in the medical AI development pipeline.

### Significance
The successful development of SAFEGEN would address several critical barriers currently impeding the safe deployment of generative models in medical imaging:

1. **Enhanced Safety**: By providing robust quality checks before generated images are used in clinical or training settings, SAFEGEN could prevent potential harm from flawed synthetic data.

2. **Accelerated Development**: Interpretable feedback would enable developers to identify and address specific failure modes in their generative models, accelerating improvement cycles.

3. **Increased Trust**: Transparent explanations regarding the quality and safety of generated images would build confidence among clinicians and regulatory bodies.

4. **Standardization**: The framework could establish industry standards for evaluating synthetic medical images, facilitating responsible innovation.

5. **Broader Applicability**: Though focused on medical imaging, the interpretable safety check approach could inform similar frameworks in other high-stakes domains where generative AI is being deployed.

By bridging the gap between technical capabilities and clinical requirements, SAFEGEN has the potential to unlock the benefits of generative AI in healthcare while mitigating associated risks, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Framework Overview

SAFEGEN is structured as a multi-component pipeline designed to provide both automated safety assessment and interpretable feedback for generated medical images. The framework consists of four main components:

1. **Anomaly Detection Module**: A deep learning-based system trained to identify deviations from realistic medical imaging characteristics.
2. **Feature Attribution Module**: A component that explains detection results by highlighting contributing regions and features.
3. **Medical-specific Taxonomy**: A structured categorization of potential artifacts and safety issues.
4. **Clinical Validation System**: A methodology for correlating SAFEGEN's outputs with expert radiologist assessments.

### 2.2 Anomaly Detection Module

The anomaly detection module will be implemented as a two-stage system combining reconstruction-based and feature-based approaches.

#### 2.2.1 Reconstruction-based Anomaly Detection

We will employ a diffusion-based approach inspired by recent advances in medical anomaly detection. The model will learn to generate "healthy" or "normal" versions of input images, with significant differences between the input and reconstruction highlighting potential anomalies.

The diffusion process follows:

$$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \beta_t\mathbf{I})$$

where $x_t$ represents the image at noise level $t$, and $\beta_t$ is the noise schedule. 

The reverse process, learned by our model, is defined as:

$$p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t))$$

where $\theta$ represents the model parameters.

For anomaly detection, we define the reconstruction anomaly score as:

$$S_{recon}(x) = \|x - R_\theta(x)\|_2^2$$

where $R_\theta(x)$ represents the fully reconstructed "normal" version of input image $x$.

#### 2.2.2 Feature-based Anomaly Detection

In parallel, we will implement a feature-based anomaly detection system using a medical imaging-specific encoder $E_\phi$ trained on real medical images. This encoder will learn a latent representation of normal anatomical structures.

For a given input image $x$, we compute:

$$S_{feat}(x) = d(E_\phi(x), \text{NN}(E_\phi(x)))$$

where $d(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a distance function in feature space, and $\text{NN}(E_\phi(x))$ represents the nearest neighbor of the encoded input from a database of real medical image encodings.

#### 2.2.3 Combined Anomaly Score

The final anomaly score combines both approaches:

$$S_{combined}(x) = \alpha \cdot S_{recon}(x) + (1-\alpha) \cdot S_{feat}(x)$$

where $\alpha$ is a weighting parameter that will be optimized during validation.

Additionally, we compute localized anomaly maps by backpropagating the anomaly score to the input space:

$$M_{anom}(x) = \frac{\partial S_{combined}(x)}{\partial x}$$

### 2.3 Feature Attribution Module

The feature attribution module interprets the anomaly detection results by providing visual and semantic explanations for identified issues.

#### 2.3.1 Visual Attribution

We will implement multiple attribution methods to ensure robust explanations:

1. **Grad-CAM-based Attribution**: Utilizing gradients flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce coarse localization maps highlighting the important regions.

$$L_{Grad-CAM}^c = \text{ReLU}\left(\sum_k \alpha_k^c A^k\right)$$

where $\alpha_k^c = \frac{1}{Z}\sum_i\sum_j \frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{ij}^k}$ and $A^k$ represents the $k$-th feature map.

2. **SHAP-based Attribution**: Applying SHapley Additive exPlanations to provide pixel-level contribution scores.

$$\phi_i(f, x) = \sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|!(|N|-|S|-1)!}{|N|!} [f(S \cup \{i\}) - f(S)]$$

where $\phi_i$ represents the contribution of pixel $i$ to the prediction.

3. **Contrastive Explanations**: Generating counterfactual normal versions of anomalous regions to highlight differences.

$$C(x, r) = \|x_r - \text{Normal}(x_r)\|$$

where $x_r$ is a region in image $x$, and $\text{Normal}(x_r)$ is a normal/healthy version of that region.

#### 2.3.2 Semantic Attribution

Beyond visual heatmaps, we will implement a semantic classifier to categorize identified anomalies according to a medical imaging-specific taxonomy:

1. Anatomical inconsistencies (e.g., misplaced organs)
2. Texture artifacts (e.g., checkerboard patterns)
3. Boundary artifacts (e.g., blurry or jagged edges)
4. Contrast/intensity abnormalities
5. Physiologically impossible features
6. Modality-specific artifacts (e.g., MRI ringing artifacts)

The classifier will be trained on synthetic examples of each category:

$$P(c|x, M_{anom}) = \text{Softmax}(f_\psi(x, M_{anom}))$$

where $f_\psi$ is a neural network with parameters $\psi$ that takes the image and anomaly map as inputs.

### 2.4 Training Methodology

We will utilize the following datasets for training and evaluation:

1. **Real Medical Images**: MICCAI datasets, UK Biobank MRI scans, TCIA collections

3. **Augmented Synthetic Images**: Synthetic images with intentionally introduced artifacts of varying intensities

The dataset will be split into:
