1. Title:  
CertiGen: Provably Robust and Interpretable Multimodal Generative Framework for Clinical Applications  

2. Motivation:  
Deploying generative models in healthcare risks hallucinations, privacy breaches, and opaque decision paths. CertiGen aims to provide strong safety guarantees and human‐understandable outputs, reducing clinical errors and fostering practitioner trust in AI‐assisted diagnosis and reporting.  

3. Main Idea:  
CertiGen integrates (a) certified robustness through randomized smoothing and Lipschitz‐constrained fine-tuning applied jointly to medical images and electronic health record (EHR) text, and (b) concept-bottleneck attribution layers that map internal representations to clinically meaningful features (e.g., lesions or lab anomalies). During training, adversarial perturbations simulate worst-case noise in scans and reports, while a Lagrangian safety term enforces hard bounds on output shifts. At inference, each generated report or image annotation carries a provable robustness certificate and a ranked list of contributing clinical features. We will validate CertiGen on radiology report generation and multimodal patient summaries, measuring error reduction under adversarial stress and clinician‐rated interpretability. By coupling formal safety guarantees with transparent explanations, CertiGen paves the way for trustworthy, deployable generative AI in high‐stakes healthcare settings.
