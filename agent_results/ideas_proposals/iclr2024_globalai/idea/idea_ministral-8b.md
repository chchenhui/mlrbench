### Title: "Culturally-Aware Generative AI: A Multidisciplinary Approach"

### Motivation
The global deployment of AI systems often overlooks cultural nuances, resulting in biased and exclusionary outcomes. This research aims to bridge the gap between AI technology and cultural understanding, ensuring that AI systems are inclusive and respectful across diverse cultures.

### Main Idea
The proposed research will develop a framework for creating culturally-aware generative AI models by integrating insights from humanities and social sciences with AI engineering. The methodology involves:
1. **Conceptual Foundations**: Establishing a shared vocabulary for cultural inclusion in AI, defining metrics for cross-cultural performance, and identifying challenges.
2. **Culturally-Rich Datasets**: Creating and curating datasets that are representative of diverse cultural values and practices, ensuring they are inclusive and unbiased.
3. **Cultural Value Recognition**: Developing methods to identify and account for cultural values embedded in AI pipelines, aligning development and deployment cultures.
4. **User Interaction Strategies**: Designing user interfaces and public education strategies that promote the inclusion of subjugated cultural values.
5. **Impact Analysis**: Studying the immediate and long-term impacts of generative AI on cultural industries, evaluating how AI supports or challenges existing dynamics.

Expected outcomes include a comprehensive framework for culturally-aware AI development, scalable evaluation pipelines, and culturally representative datasets. This research will have a significant impact by ensuring AI systems are inclusive, respectful, and beneficial to diverse global cultures.
