# Domain-Adaptive Concept Embeddings for Reducing Hallucinations in Multimodal Models

## Motivation
Multimodal foundational models often produce hallucinations—generating content inconsistent with reality or input prompts—especially when navigating diverse domains. Current solutions either restrict model outputs through filtering or require expensive retraining with specialized datasets. These approaches are reactive, computationally intensive, and fail to address the underlying mechanisms causing hallucinations. The field needs more efficient and proactive solutions to enhance model reliability without compromising performance or requiring complete retraining.

## Main Idea
We propose developing domain-adaptive concept embeddings (DACE) that dynamically adjust a model's semantic understanding based on domain-specific knowledge. The approach involves: (1) Creating a lightweight layer that learns domain-specific concept relationships through contrastive learning between validated and hallucinated content; (2) Implementing an attention-based mechanism that dynamically weights these domain embeddings during inference based on input context; and (3) Developing a self-verification module that evaluates internal representation consistency across modalities. Unlike existing approaches, DACE doesn't require retraining the entire model but rather augments it with domain knowledge through a modular architecture. This method could significantly reduce hallucinations while being computationally efficient, adaptable to new domains, and implementable as a plug-in for existing models, offering a sustainable path to more reliable multimodal systems.
