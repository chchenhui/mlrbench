**Title:** Knowledge-Guided Multimodal Pre-Training for Reliable and Sustainable Generative Models  

**Motivation:**  
Multimodal generative models often produce hallucinations or harmful content due to misalignment with factual/ethical knowledge and biased datasets. Reactive post-hoc fixes are resource-intensive and insufficient. Proactively integrating reliability and sustainability into pre-training could address these issues at their source, ensuring trustworthy deployment in critical domains like robotics and healthcare.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a pre-training framework that combines **knowledge-grounded contrastive learning** with **dynamic dataset curation**. First, a multimodal knowledge graph (e.g., Wikidata, curated image-text pairs) is used to train a model with a dual objective: (1) align cross-modal representations (e.g., text-image) with verified knowledge using a contrastive loss, and (2) suppress harmful/biased outputs via adversarial filtering. During pre-training, a "knowledge consistency score" evaluates generated outputs; low-scoring samples trigger updates to both the model and training data, iteratively refining quality. For sustainability, the framework prioritizes data efficiency by dynamically pruning redundant or harmful examples, reducing computational overhead. Expected outcomes include reduced hallucinations, improved fairness metrics, and 30â€“40% lower training costs. This approach could set a precedent for preemptive, knowledge-driven model development, enabling scalable, ethical deployment in real-world applications.
