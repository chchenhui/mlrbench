Title: DeepFailDB – A Cross‐Domain Repository and Meta‐Analysis Toolkit for Real‐World Deep Learning Failures

Motivation: Deep learning (DL) often breaks in real‐world deployments due to unanticipated data shifts, hidden biases, and hardware constraints. These failures remain siloed in specific fields, delaying progress and leading to redundant mistakes. A unified, searchable platform can accelerate understanding of common pitfalls, drive transparency of negative results, and guide practitioners toward more robust DL systems.

Main Idea: We propose DeepFailDB, an open community platform that collects, standardizes, and analyzes DL failure cases across domains. Each entry records (1) application context, (2) proposed DL solution, (3) negative outcome, and (4) hypothesized root causes (e.g., distribution shift, label noise, resource limits). A tagging ontology enables cross–domain filtering, while built‐in meta-analysis algorithms cluster similar failure modes and surface recurring patterns. An API and dashboard allow researchers to (a) query pre‐published failures relevant to new tasks, (b) visualize common error clusters, and (c) receive data‐driven mitigation recommendations (e.g., robust training, domain adaptation). By crowdsourcing failure knowledge, DeepFailDB aims to improve deployment success rates, foster transparency, and inform future DL research directions.
