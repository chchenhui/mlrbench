### Title: "Real-World Deep Learning Failures: A Cross-Domain Platform for Sharing and Learning"

### Motivation:
The deployment of deep learning (DL) models in real-world applications often falls short of expectations due to unanticipated challenges and failures. These issues are rarely documented and shared across different domains, hindering the broader understanding and improvement of DL techniques. Establishing a cross-domain platform to collect and discuss these failures can foster a culture of transparency and learning, leading to more robust and reliable DL models.

### Main Idea:
**Platform Development:** Create a centralized platform, "DeepLearningFailuresHub," to collect and share real-world DL failure cases from diverse fields such as healthcare, robotics, education, and social sciences. The platform will include a database of case studies, each detailing a use case, the proposed DL solution, the observed failure, and an analysis of the underlying reasons.

**Methodology:** The platform will use a crowdsourcing model to gather case studies from researchers and industry professionals. Each submission will undergo a peer-review process to ensure rigor and transparency. The platform will also host workshops and seminars to facilitate cross-domain discussions and identify common failure patterns.

**Expected Outcomes:**
1. **Enhanced Understanding:** Identification and analysis of common failure modes and their underlying reasons across different domains.
2. **Improved Models:** Development of more robust and reliable DL models by learning from real-world failures.
3. **Knowledge Sharing:** Creation of a community of practitioners and researchers who can learn from each other's experiences and mistakes.

**Potential Impact:**
By fostering a culture of transparency and learning, the DeepLearningFailuresHub will accelerate the advancement of DL techniques, leading to more effective and reliable real-world applications. This platform will also encourage a shift in the publication paradigm, prioritizing the sharing of negative results and practical challenges over just benchmark performance.
