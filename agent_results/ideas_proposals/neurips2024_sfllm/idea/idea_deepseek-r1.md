**Title:** Adaptive Conformal Prediction for Uncertainty Quantification in Black-Box LLMs  

**Motivation:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications (e.g., healthcare, legal analysis), where uncertainty quantification is critical for risk mitigation. Traditional conformal prediction methods assume access to model internals or exchangeable data, but these requirements are often unmet with proprietary black-box APIs (e.g., GPT-4) or non-stationary LLM outputs.  

**Main Idea:** This work proposes an adaptive conformal prediction framework tailored for LLMs that dynamically adjusts to model uncertainty without requiring access to internal parameters. The methodology leverages *proxy nonconformity scores* derived from observable outputs (e.g., token probabilities, attention entropy, or embedding dispersion) and integrates temperature scaling-like techniques to calibrate prediction intervals. To handle distribution shifts, the framework uses lightweight online updates via feedback from API rate limits or user-provided reliability indicators. Experiments will validate the approach on benchmarks like medical QA and legal text analysis, comparing coverage guarantees and interval tightness against existing black-box uncertainty methods. Expected outcomes include theoretical guarantees under relaxed exchangeability assumptions and open-source tools for generating risk-aware LLM predictions. If successful, this would enable safer deployment of LLMs in domains requiring statistical rigor, bridging the gap between black-box AI and operational safety standards.
