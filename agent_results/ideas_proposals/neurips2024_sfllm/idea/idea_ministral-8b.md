### Title: "Robust Statistical Uncertainty Quantification for Black-Box LLMs"

### Motivation:
The rise of large language models (LLMs) and foundation models has created a need for new statistical tools to understand and mitigate their operational risks. Traditional statistical methods struggle to apply to these complex, black-box models. This research aims to develop robust statistical techniques for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, ensuring reliable and interpretable model performance.

### Main Idea:
This research proposes a novel framework for uncertainty quantification in black-box LLMs using conformal prediction techniques and Bayesian inference. The methodology involves:

1. **Data Augmentation**: Enhancing training data with synthetic samples to improve model robustness.
2. **Conformal Prediction**: Applying conformal prediction to estimate prediction intervals for LLMs, providing bounds on the model's uncertainty.
3. **Bayesian Inference**: Integrating Bayesian methods to quantify model uncertainty and update beliefs based on new data.

Expected outcomes include:

- Improved model reliability and interpretability.
- Enhanced ability to detect and correct biases in LLM predictions.
- Development of new benchmarks and metrics for LLM uncertainty quantification.

Potential impact:

- Increased trust in LLM deployments across various industries.
- Better risk management and safety analysis for LLM-based systems.
- Advancements in the field of statistical methods for black-box models, paving the way for future research.
