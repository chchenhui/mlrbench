# Federated Prompt Tuning for Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Adaptation of Foundation Models

## 1. Introduction

### Background
The emergence of foundation models such as GPT-4, LLaMA, and PaLM has revolutionized machine learning by demonstrating exceptional capabilities across diverse tasks. These large pre-trained models have democratized AI development, allowing practitioners to focus on adapting existing models rather than building specialized architectures from scratch. However, the adaptation of foundation models presents significant challenges, particularly in environments where data is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be centralized due to privacy concerns, regulatory constraints (such as GDPR or HIPAA), or computational limitations.

Traditional fine-tuning approaches require updating all or most parameters of these massive models, often demanding extensive computational resources beyond what is available to many organizations. This challenge is further amplified in federated learning (FL) settings, where the communication overhead of transmitting model updates between clients and a central server can become prohibitive. Additionally, data heterogeneity across clients introduces optimization challenges that can impede model convergence and performance.

Prompt tuning has emerged as a promising alternative to full model fine-tuning, allowing adaptation of foundation models by optimizing a small set of continuous prompt parameters while keeping the base model frozen. This approach drastically reduces the parameter space to be optimized, making it particularly attractive for resource-constrained environments. However, existing research on integrating prompt tuning with federated learning paradigms remains limited, especially in addressing the unique challenges posed by heterogeneous data distributions and privacy requirements.

### Research Objectives
This research aims to develop and evaluate a comprehensive framework for federated prompt tuning (FedPT) that enables efficient, privacy-preserving, and effective adaptation of foundation models across distributed clients. Specifically, our objectives are to:

1. Design a federated prompt tuning framework that minimizes communication overhead while maintaining competitive performance compared to centralized prompt tuning approaches.
2. Develop novel prompt aggregation mechanisms that address data heterogeneity challenges in federated settings.
3. Integrate privacy-preserving techniques to ensure client data remains protected throughout the federated prompt tuning process.
4. Evaluate the proposed framework across diverse foundation models, tasks, and client data distributions to demonstrate its broad applicability.
5. Analyze the tradeoffs between communication efficiency, computational requirements, model performance, and privacy guarantees.

### Significance
This research addresses a critical gap in the current literature by establishing methodologies for efficiently adapting foundation models in privacy-sensitive, distributed environments. The significance of this work lies in:

1. **Democratizing Access to AI Capabilities**: By reducing the computational and communication requirements for adapting foundation models, our approach enables a broader range of organizations and individuals to benefit from state-of-the-art AI capabilities.

2. **Enabling Privacy-Preserving Collaboration**: Our framework allows organizations in regulated industries such as healthcare and finance to collaboratively improve models without sharing sensitive data, potentially unlocking valuable insights while respecting privacy constraints.

3. **Advancing Resource Efficiency**: The proposed techniques contribute to more sustainable AI by minimizing the computational and energy resources required for model adaptation.

4. **Addressing Data Heterogeneity**: Our approach tackles the critical challenge of non-IID data distribution in real-world federated settings, providing robust performance across diverse client datasets.

By addressing these challenges, this research will establish a foundation for scalable, privacy-aware adaptation of foundation models across distributed environments, potentially transforming how organizations leverage AI in privacy-sensitive domains.

## 2. Methodology

Our proposed federated prompt tuning (FedPT) framework enables distributed clients to collaboratively adapt a shared foundation model by optimizing lightweight prompt parameters locally while preserving privacy and addressing data heterogeneity. The methodology consists of four key components: (1) prompt tuning mechanism, (2) federated learning protocol, (3) heterogeneity-aware prompt aggregation, and (4) privacy preservation techniques.

### 2.1 Prompt Tuning Mechanism

We adopt a soft prompt tuning approach where each client learns continuous prompt embeddings that are prepended to the input of a foundation model. Formally, given a foundation model $M$ with parameters $\theta$ (kept frozen), and input tokens $x = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$, we prepend a learnable prompt embedding $P = [P_1, P_2, ..., P_m]$ to form the augmented input:

$$x_{aug} = [P_1, P_2, ..., P_m, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$$

Each prompt token $P_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ has the same dimensionality $d$ as the model's token embeddings. The model output is then computed as:

$$y = M(x_{aug}; \theta)$$

To enhance expressivity while maintaining parameter efficiency, we explore additional prompt tuning variants:

1. **Prefix Tuning**: Rather than only prepending prompts to the input, we insert learnable key-value pairs at each attention layer $l$:

   $$P^{(l)} = [P^{(l)}_K, P^{(l)}_V]$$

   where $P^{(l)}_K \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$ and $P^{(l)}_V \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$ are the learnable key and value prompt embeddings for layer $l$.

2. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: We parameterize updates to the model's weight matrices $W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$ via low-rank decomposition:

   $$\Delta W = BA$$

   where $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ and $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$ with rank $r \ll \min(d, k)$. The effective weight matrix becomes $W + \Delta W$.

3. **P-tuning**: We implement continuous prompts through an LSTM-based prompt encoder:

   $$P = \text{LSTM}(E)$$

   where $E \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d'}$ are trainable embedding parameters with $d' \ll d$, reducing the parameter count further.

For each client $i$ with dataset $D_i$, the local optimization objective is:

$$\min_{P_i} \mathcal{L}(D_i; P_i, \theta)$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is the task-specific loss function, $P_i$ represents the client's prompt parameters, and $\theta$ are the frozen foundation model parameters.

### 2.2 Federated Learning Protocol

Our federated prompt tuning protocol follows an iterative process:

1. **Initialization**: The server initializes prompt parameters $P^0$ (either randomly or with task-specific tokens) and distributes them to all participating clients along with the frozen foundation model $M$ (or access to its API).

2. **Local Training**: In each round $t$, each client $i$ trains its prompt parameters $P_i^t$ using its local dataset $D_i$ for $E$ local epochs:

   $$P_i^t = P_i^{t-1} - \eta \nabla \mathcal{L}(D_i; P_i^{t-1}, \theta)$$

   where $\eta$ is the learning rate. To manage memory constraints, we employ gradient accumulation and mixed-precision training.

3. **Communication**: Each client sends only its prompt parameters $P_i^t$ (or parameter updates $\Delta P_i^t = P_i^t - P_i^{t-1}$) to the server, significantly reducing communication overhead compared to full model updates.

4. **Aggregation**: The server aggregates the received prompt parameters to form the global prompt $P^t$ (detailed in Section 2.3).

5. **Distribution**: The server distributes the updated global prompt $P^t$ to all clients for the next round.

For black-box scenarios where clients only have API access to the foundation model, we implement a zero-order optimization approach:

$$\nabla \mathcal{L}(D_i; P_i) \approx \frac{\mathcal{L}(D_i; P_i + \delta) - \mathcal{L}(D_i; P_i - \delta)}{2\delta}$$

where $\delta$ is a small perturbation. This allows clients to approximate gradients through function evaluations only.

### 2.3 Heterogeneity-Aware Prompt Aggregation

To address data heterogeneity across clients, we propose a Dynamic Heterogeneity-Aware Prompt Aggregation (DHAPA) mechanism that goes beyond simple averaging. Our aggregation approach considers:

1. **Client Data Diversity**: We quantify the diversity of each client's data by computing an uncertainty score:

   $$u_i = \frac{1}{|D_i|} \sum_{(x,y) \in D_i} H(p(y|x; P_i^t, \theta))$$

   where $H$ is the entropy function and $p(y|x; P_i^t, \theta)$ is the predicted probability distribution.

2. **Representation Gap**: We measure how much each client's data distribution differs from the global distribution:

   $$g_i = \left\| \frac{1}{|D_i|} \sum_{(x,y) \in D_i} f(x) - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{1}{|D_j|} \sum_{(x,y) \in D_j} f(x) \right\|_2$$

   where $f(x)$ represents embeddings from an intermediate layer of the foundation model.

3. **Performance Improvement**: We track the change in validation performance for each client:

   $$\Delta p_i = \text{perf}(P_i^t) - \text{perf}(P_i^{t-1})$$

These metrics are combined to form client weights $w_i$ for aggregation:

$$w_i = \alpha \cdot \text{softmax}(u_i) + \beta \cdot (1 - \text{normalize}(g_i)) + \gamma \cdot \text{normalize}(\Delta p_i)$$

where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are hyperparameters controlling the importance of each component, and normalize scales values to [0,1].

The global prompt is then updated using weighted aggregation:

$$P^t = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{w_i}{\sum_{j=1}^N w_j} P_i^t$$

To further address heterogeneity, we implement a clustering-based approach that groups clients with similar data distributions:

1. Use representation gap metrics to cluster clients into $K$ groups.
2. Perform within-cluster aggregation to create cluster-specific prompts.
3. Allow clients to select the most appropriate cluster prompt based on local validation performance.

### 2.4 Privacy Preservation Techniques

To ensure client data privacy, we incorporate several complementary approaches:

1. **Secure Aggregation**: We implement cryptographic protocols for secure aggregation of prompt parameters without revealing individual client updates:

   $$P^t = \text{SecureAggregate}(P_1^t, P_2^t, ..., P_N^t)$$

   This is achieved through a combination of masking with random values and threshold homomorphic encryption.

2. **Differential Privacy**: We apply client-level differential privacy by adding calibrated noise to client updates before transmission:

   $$\tilde{P}_i^t = P_i^t + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 C^2 \mathbf{I})$$

   where $C$ is the clipping norm and $\sigma$ is the noise scale determined by the desired privacy budget $(\epsilon, \delta)$.

3. **Selective Parameter Sharing**: We develop mechanisms to identify and share only the most important prompt parameters, reducing the privacy surface:

   $$\Delta \tilde{P}_i^t = \text{TopK}(\Delta P_i^t, k) + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 C^2 \mathbf{I})$$

   where TopK selects the $k$ parameters with the largest absolute values.
