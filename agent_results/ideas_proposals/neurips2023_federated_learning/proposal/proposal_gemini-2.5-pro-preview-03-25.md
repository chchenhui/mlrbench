**1. Title:** FedTune: Efficient and Heterogeneity-Robust Federated Prompt Tuning for Foundation Models

**2. Introduction**

**Background:**
The advent of foundation models (FMs), such as large language models (LLMs) like GPT and vision transformers (ViTs), has marked a significant paradigm shift in machine learning. These models, pre-trained on vast datasets, exhibit remarkable zero-shot and few-shot capabilities across diverse tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). Consequently, the focus for practitioners often shifts from designing model architectures from scratch to adapting these powerful pre-trained models to specific downstream applications through fine-tuning. However, this adaptation process itself presents substantial challenges. Firstly, fine-tuning entire FMs, which often contain billions of parameters, demands considerable computational resources (memory and compute), rendering it impractical on resource-constrained edge devices or even within budget-limited organizations. Secondly, the data required for fine-tuning specialised tasks (e.g., in healthcare or finance) is frequently sensitive, proprietary, and geographically distributed across different entities (clients). Centralizing such data for traditional supervised fine-tuning raises significant privacy concerns and often violates regulatory frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA.

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a compelling solution to train models on decentralized data without compromising privacy (McMahan et al., 2017). In FL, multiple clients collaboratively train a global model under the coordination of a central server, while their raw data remains localised. Clients typically train the model on their local data and share only model updates (e.g., gradients or parameters) with the server, which aggregates them to refine the global model. While FL effectively addresses data privacy and distribution issues, applying it directly to fine-tune large FMs (Federated Full Fine-Tuning, FFFT) inherits the high computational and communication costs associated with large model sizes (Yu et al., 2023). Transmitting multi-billion parameter updates frequently between numerous clients and the server can be prohibitively expensive and slow.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly prompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021) and related methods like adapter tuning (Houlsby et al., 2019) and LoRA (Hu et al., 2021), offer a promising alternative. These methods adapt FMs by training only a small subset of parameters (e.g., continuous prompt embeddings prepended to the input, or low-rank adaptation matrices) while keeping the vast majority of the FM parameters frozen. This significantly reduces the computational and memory footprint of fine-tuning. Integrating PEFT, specifically prompt tuning, into the FL framework—Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT)—presents a pathway towards efficient and privacy-preserving adaptation of FMs. By having clients only train and communicate updates for the minuscule prompt parameters, FPT drastically cuts down communication overhead and local computational requirements compared to FFFT.

However, realizing the full potential of FPT requires addressing several inherent challenges of FL, amplified in the context of FMs and diverse client data. Key among these is **data heterogeneity**, where clients possess data that is not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). Non-IID data can arise from differences in data quantity, feature distributions, or label distributions across clients, leading to conflicting local updates, model divergence, slow convergence, and poor personalization (Li et al., 2020; Karimireddy et al., 2020). Existing FPT works, such as FedBPT (Sun et al., 2023), FedDTPT (Wu et al., 2024), and Fed-BBPT (Lin et al., 2023), have primarily focused on black-box scenarios (API access only, using gradient-free methods) and reducing communication cost, but robust handling of data heterogeneity in the standard (white-box, gradient-based) FPT setting remains an open area. Specifically, naive aggregation strategies like FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017) applied to prompt parameters may perform poorly under significant heterogeneity. Furthermore, ensuring the **privacy** of even the small prompt updates against inference attacks remains crucial, necessitating secure aggregation mechanisms.

**Research Objectives:**
This research aims to develop and evaluate **FedTune**, a novel framework for Federated Prompt Tuning specifically designed to be efficient, robust to data heterogeneity, and privacy-preserving. The core objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Flexible FPT Framework:** Design and implement an FPT framework capable of supporting various prompt tuning techniques (e.g., Prefix Tuning, P-Tuning) and potentially related PEFT methods (e.g., LoRA adapters treated as tunable "prompts") within a federated setting, assuming clients have white-box access to the FM for gradient computation.
2.  **Design Heterogeneity-Robust Aggregation:** Propose and evaluate novel dynamic prompt aggregation mechanisms at the server-side that explicitly account for client data heterogeneity. This involves moving beyond simple averaging to weighting or clustering client prompt updates based on inferred data characteristics, update similarity, or local performance.
3.  **Integrate Privacy-Enhancing Techniques:** Incorporate established privacy-preserving techniques, namely Secure Aggregation (SecAgg) and Differential Privacy (DP), into the FPT framework to protect individual client prompt updates from leakage during communication and aggregation.
4.  **Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation:** Rigorously evaluate the proposed FedTune framework against relevant baselines across diverse datasets exhibiting varying degrees and types of non-IID distributions. The evaluation will focus on model performance (accuracy), communication efficiency, computational cost (client-side), convergence speed, and robustness to heterogeneity.
5.  **Analyze Privacy-Utility Trade-offs:** Quantify the impact of applying DP on model performance and convergence within the FPT context, providing insights into the achievable privacy-utility trade-offs.

**Significance:**
This research addresses a critical intersection of three rapidly evolving fields: Foundation Models, Federated Learning, and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning. By developing an efficient and robust FPT framework, this work will:

*   **Enable Scalable FM Adaptation:** Provide a practical solution for adapting large FMs in decentralized settings where data cannot be pooled, significantly lowering the communication and computational barriers compared to federated full fine-tuning.
*   **Facilitate Applications in Sensitive Domains:** Allow organizations in sectors like healthcare (e.g., federated medical image analysis, clinical note processing) and finance (e.g., federated fraud detection, sentiment analysis) to leverage the power of FMs on their distributed, private data Bsafely and efficiently.
*   **Advance Federated Learning Algorithms:** Contribute novel aggregation strategies specifically tailored for the unique characteristics of prompt tuning under data heterogeneity, advancing the state-of-the-art in FL algorithms beyond standard FedAvg and its variants.
*   **Provide Empirical Benchmarks:** Offer valuable empirical comparisons of different prompt tuning methods within the FL paradigm under realistic non-IID conditions, guiding future research and practical deployments.
*   **Promote Privacy-Preserving AI:** Strengthen the toolkit for building privacy-preserving AI systems by integrating and analyzing privacy techniques within the context of FPT for large models.

**3. Methodology**

**Overall Framework (FedTune):**
The proposed FedTune framework operates iteratively over communication rounds $t = 1, 2, ..., T$. The system consists of a central server orchestrating the process and $N$ clients (e.g., organizations, devices), each holding a local dataset $D_k$ ($k = 1, ..., N$). A pre-trained foundation model $M$ with parameters $\theta$ is assumed to be available to all clients (or accessible via a shared resource), and its parameters $\theta$ are kept **frozen** throughout the process. The adaptation occurs by tuning a set of lightweight prompt parameters, denoted by $p$.

The FedTune process proceeds as follows:

1.  **Initialization (Round $t=0$):** The server initializes the global prompt parameters $p_{global}^0$. The specific form of $p$ depends on the chosen prompt tuning technique (e.g., a sequence of continuous vectors for Prefix Tuning).
2.  **Distribution:** The server sends the current global prompt parameters $p_{global}^t$ to a selected subset of clients $S_t \subseteq \{1, ..., N\}$.
3.  **Local Client Update:** Each selected client $k \in S_t$ initializes its local prompt $p_k^t$ with $p_{global}^t$. It then performs local training for $E$ epochs (or a fixed number of steps) to optimize $p_k$ using its local dataset $D_k$. The objective is to minimize the local loss function $L_k$:
    $$
    p_k^{t+1} = \arg\min_{p} \sum_{(x_i, y_i) \in D_k} \mathcal{L}(M(p; x_i), y_i) \quad \text{starting from } p=p_k^t
    $$
    where $M(p; x_i)$ denotes the output of the frozen foundation model $M$ given input $x_i$ and the tunable prompt parameters $p$, and $\mathcal{L}$ is the task-specific loss function (e.g., cross-entropy). Optimization is typically performed using gradient descent methods (e.g., Adam) on the prompt parameters $p_k$ only:
    $$
    p_k \leftarrow p_k - \eta \nabla_{p_k} L_k(p_k)
    $$
    where $\eta$ is the local learning rate. The outcome is the updated local prompt $p_k^{t+1}$.
4.  **Communication:** Each client $k \in S_t$ computes its prompt update $\Delta p_k^{t+1} = p_k^{t+1} - p_{global}^t$ (or alternatively, sends the optimized $p_k^{t+1}$ itself). These updates (or parameters) are sent back to the server. This step is communication-efficient as $|\Delta p_k| \ll |\theta|$.
5.  **Server Aggregation:** The server aggregates the received prompt updates $\{\Delta p_k^{t+1} | k \in S_t\}$ to compute the global update $\Delta p_{global}^{t+1}$, and updates the global prompt parameters:
    $$
    p_{global}^{t+1} = p_{global}^t + \Delta p_{global}^{t+1}
    $$
    This aggregation step is where our novel methods for handling heterogeneity will be introduced.
6.  **Iteration:** Repeat steps 2-5 for $T$ communication rounds or until convergence.

**Prompt Tuning Techniques:**
We will implement and compare several representative prompt tuning / PEFT methods within FedTune:
*   **Prefix Tuning:** Learns a continuous prefix (a sequence of vectors) prepended to the input layer embeddings (Li & Liang, 2021). $p$ consists of the prefix vectors.
*   **P-Tuning v2:** Improves upon Prefix Tuning by adding tunable prompt tokens to every layer of the transformer model, providing more expressive power (Liu et al., 2021). $p$ consists of these multi-layer prompt vectors.
*   **(Optional) LoRA:** Learns low-rank adaptation matrices for the query and value projection matrices in self-attention layers (Hu et al., 2021). While technically PEFT and not prompt tuning, its parameter efficiency makes it relevant. Here $p$ would represent the parameters of the low-rank matrices.

**Heterogeneity-Robust Aggregation:**
The core novelty lies in step 5, the server aggregation logic. We propose moving beyond the standard FedAvg aggregation:
$$
\Delta p_{global, \text{FedAvg}}^{t+1} = \sum_{k \in S_t} \frac{|D_k|}{\sum_{j \in S_t} |D_j|} \Delta p_k^{t+1}
$$
We will investigate dynamic aggregation strategies:

*   **Strategy 1: Performance-Weighted Aggregation (PWA):** Weight client updates based on their performance on a held-out validation set (either local or a small global proxy set). Let $v_k$ be the validation performance metric (e.g., accuracy, inverse loss) for client $k$. The aggregation becomes:
    $$
    \Delta p_{global, \text{PWA}}^{t+1} = \sum_{k \in S_t} w_k \Delta p_k^{t+1}, \quad \text{where } w_k = \frac{f(v_k)}{\sum_{j \in S_t} f(v_j)}
    $$
    $f(\cdot)$ could be a simple identity or a softmax-like function to moderate weights. This aims to give more influence to clients whose prompts generalize better locally.

*   **Strategy 2: Update Similarity Clustering Aggregation (USCA):** Inspired by approaches like FedDTPT (Wu et al., 2024) but adapted for gradient-based FPT. Cluster the incoming prompt updates $\Delta p_k^{t+1}$ based on their similarity (e.g., cosine similarity).
    1.  Compute pairwise similarities $sim(\Delta p_k, \Delta p_j)$.
    2.  Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to group updates into $J$ clusters $C_1, ..., C_J$.
    3.  Compute a representative update for each cluster, e.g., by averaging within the cluster: $\Delta p_{cluster, j} = \frac{1}{|C_j|} \sum_{k \in C_j} \Delta p_k^{t+1}$.
    4.  Combine the cluster representatives, possibly weighted by cluster size or average intra-cluster validation performance:
        $$
        \Delta p_{global, \text{USCA}}^{t+1} = \sum_{j=1}^J w_j \Delta p_{cluster, j}
        $$
        This strategy aims to mitigate the negative impact of highly divergent updates by averaging them only with similar updates first.

*   **Strategy 3: Similarity-Weighted Aggregation (SWA):** Compute a 'reference' direction, potentially the previous global update or an average update, and weight each client's contribution by its similarity to this reference.
    1. Define a reference update $\Delta p_{ref}^t$. (e.g., $\Delta p_{global}^t$, or $\frac{1}{|S_t|}\sum_{k \in S_t} \Delta p_k^{t+1}$)
    2. Calculate similarity weights $w_k = \text{softmax}(\text{cosine_similarity}(\Delta p_k^{t+1}, \Delta p_{ref}^t) / \tau)$, where $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.
    3. Aggregate: $\Delta p_{global, \text{SWA}}^{t+1} = \sum_{k \in S_t} w_k \Delta p_k^{t+1}$.
    This favors updates that align with the consensus direction.

We will compare these proposed aggregation methods against the FedAvg baseline.

**Privacy Preservation:**
We will integrate two standard privacy techniques:

1.  **Secure Aggregation (SecAgg):** Employ protocols like those based on Homomorphic Encryption (HE) or Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) (Bonawitz et al., 2017). Clients encrypt their updates $\Delta p_k^{t+1}$ before sending them to the server. The server can compute the sum of the encrypted updates without decrypting individual ones: $\sum_{k \in S_t} \text{Enc}(\Delta p_k^{t+1}) = \text{Enc}(\sum_{k \in S_t} \Delta p_k^{t+1})$. This sum can then be decrypted (requiring collaboration or a threshold of clients depending on the protocol) to get the aggregated update, ensuring individual updates remain secret from the server. We will theoretically analyze the communication and computation overhead added by SecAgg.
2.  **Differential Privacy (DP):** Apply client-level DP by adding calibrated noise to the prompt updates before transmission (Abadi et al., 2016). Before sending $\Delta p_k^{t+1}$, the client first clips its norm to a threshold $C$ and then adds Gaussian noise scaled by the sensitivity $C$ and the privacy parameters $(\epsilon, \delta)$:
    $$
    \widetilde{\Delta p}_k^{t+1} = \frac{\Delta p_k^{t+1}}{\max(1, ||\Delta p_k^{t+1}||_2 / C)} + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 C^2 \mathbf{I})
    $$
    where $\sigma$ is calibrated based on the number of clients, sampling rate, number of rounds, and the desired privacy budget $(\epsilon, \delta)$. We will analyze the impact of varying $\epsilon$ on model performance.

**Experimental Design:**
*   **Foundation Models:** We will use widely accessible FMs, such as RoBERTa-base/large (Liu et al., 2019) for NLP tasks and ViT-base (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) for CV tasks.
*   **Datasets & Heterogeneity Simulation:** We will use benchmark datasets and simulate non-IID distributions:
    *   **NLP:** GLUE benchmark tasks (Wang et al., 2018) (e.g., SST-2 for sentiment, MNLI for inference). Non-IID simulation: partition by quantity (varying amounts of data per client), label distribution skew (Dirichlet distribution over labels), feature skew (partition based on text domain or style if applicable). Potentially use domain-specific datasets like financial news (e.g., FPB) or clinical notes (e.g., MIMIC-III, requiring local access/simulation).
    *   **CV:** CIFAR-10/100, potentially medical imaging datasets like ChestX-ray14 (Wang et al., 2017) or partitions of pathology slides (e.g., Camelyon16). Non-IID simulation: similar strategies (quantity skew, label skew via Dirichlet, feature skew via partitioning by superclass or source).
*   **Baselines for Comparison:**
    1.  **Centralized Prompt Tuning:** Upper bound performance (trained on pooled data, ignoring privacy).
    2.  **Federated Full Fine-Tuning (FFFT) with FedAvg:** Standard FL applied to the entire FM.
    3.  **FedAvg + Prompt Tuning:** The proposed FPT framework using standard FedAvg aggregation.
    4.  **FedProx + Prompt Tuning:** Apply FedProx regularization (Li et al., 2020) to prompt tuning as a baseline heterogeneity mitigation technique.
    5.  **(If feasible)** Re-implementations or results from relevant literature like FedBPT/FedDTPT (adapting black-box ideas if possible or comparing conceptually).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Model Performance:** Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU score, Dice score (as appropriate for the task). Report mean and standard deviation across clients.
    *   **Communication Cost:** Total data transferred (Megabytes) per round and overall (uplink and downlink separately). Focus on the ratio compared to FFFT.
    *   **Computational Cost:** Average local training time per client per round. Server aggregation time.
    *   **Convergence:** Number of communication rounds required to reach a target performance level.
    *   **Robustness:** Performance variance across clients under different non-IID levels (measured using metrics like Gini coefficient of accuracy distribution). Analyze performance on minority classes/clients.
    *   **Privacy:** Report the theoretical $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantee achieved for DP experiments. Qualitatively discuss privacy protection offered by SecAgg.

*   **Implementation:** We will use standard ML frameworks (PyTorch) and FL simulation libraries (e.g., Flower, FedML) to implement FedTune and conduct experiments.

By addressing the key challenges of efficiency, heterogeneity, and privacy in federated prompt tuning, this research promises to unlock the potential of FMs for a wider range of applications while upholding crucial data privacy principles.
