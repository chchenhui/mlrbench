# Diffusion-Based Inference-Time Alignment for Language Models via Target Density Sampling

## 1. Introduction

### Background
In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, aligning these models with specific human preferences or constraints often requires costly fine-tuning or retraining procedures. Traditional alignment methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), can be computationally expensive and may suffer from over-optimization, leading to suboptimal performance. In this research proposal, we aim to address these challenges by developing a diffusion-based inference-time alignment method for LLMs, which dynamically aligns the model outputs with target densities during inference without the need for extensive retraining.

### Research Objectives
The primary objectives of this research are:
1. To propose a diffusion-inspired sampler that generates text by iteratively denoising sequences while incorporating guidance from a target reward model.
2. To train a transition kernel to sample from the joint distribution of the base LLM and the target density, using gradient-based updates akin to Langevin dynamics.
3. To enable real-time adaptation of LLMs to diverse constraints or user preferences without modifying the base model weights.
4. To evaluate the efficiency, controllability, and scalability of the proposed method compared to traditional alignment techniques.

### Significance
The proposed method offers several advantages over existing alignment techniques:
- **Efficiency**: By performing alignment during inference, the method reduces the computational overhead associated with fine-tuning or retraining.
- **Flexibility**: The approach allows for real-time adaptation to diverse constraints or user preferences, enabling dynamic alignment with minimal computational resources.
- **Controllability**: The use of a target reward model enables fine-grained control over the alignment process, allowing for the steering of model outputs toward desired attributes or constraints.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Research Design

#### Data Collection
We will utilize a diverse set of datasets for training and evaluating the proposed method. These datasets will include:
- **LLM Training Data**: Pre-trained language models such as BERT, RoBERTa, or T5.
- **Reward Datasets**: Human-labeled datasets for various alignment tasks, such as safety, quality, or style preferences.

#### Algorithmic Steps
The proposed method consists of the following steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the base LLM parameters $\theta$.
   - Initialize the transition kernel parameters $\phi$.

2. **Noise Schedule**:
   - Define a token-level noise schedule $\beta_t$ for the diffusion process.

3. **Reward Model**:
   - Train a reward model $R(x, y)$ to predict the reward for a given input-output pair $(x, y)$.

4. **Diffusion Process**:
   - For each timestep $t$ in the diffusion process:
     1. Sample a noise vector $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.
     2. Compute the noisy input $x_t = x_{t-1} + \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} \epsilon$.
     3. Generate a proposal distribution $q_{\phi}(x_t | x_{t-1})$ using the transition kernel $\phi$.
     4. Update the input $x_{t-1}$ using the proposal distribution: $x_{t-1} \leftarrow q_{\phi}(x_t | x_{t-1})$.

5. **Reward-Guided Sampling**:
   - At each timestep $t$, compute the reward $r_t = R(x_t, y_t)$.
   - Update the transition kernel parameters $\phi$ using gradient-based updates to maximize the expected reward: $\phi \leftarrow \phi + \eta \nabla_{\phi} \mathbb{E}[r_t]$.

6. **Denoising**:
   - Iteratively denoise the input $x_t$ using the updated transition kernel $\phi$ until the final output $x_0$ is obtained.

#### Mathematical Formulation
The transition kernel $q_{\phi}(x_t | x_{t-1})$ can be parameterized as:
$$q_{\phi}(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \mu_{\phi}(x_{t-1}), \Sigma_{\phi}(x_{t-1}))$$
where $\mu_{\phi}(x_{t-1})$ and $\Sigma_{\phi}(x_{t-1})$ are functions of the transition kernel parameters $\phi$ and the input $x_{t-1}$.

The gradient-based update for the transition kernel parameters $\phi$ can be formulated as:
$$\phi \leftarrow \phi + \eta \nabla_{\phi} \mathbb{E}[r_t]$$
where $\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\mathbb{E}[r_t]$ is the expected reward at timestep $t$.

### 2.2 Experimental Design

#### Evaluation Metrics
To validate the proposed method, we will evaluate its performance using the following metrics:
- **Alignment Quality**: Measure the similarity between the generated outputs and the target distributions using metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, or perplexity.
- **Inference Speed**: Compare the inference time of the proposed method with traditional alignment techniques.
- **Reward Function Accuracy**: Evaluate the accuracy of the reward model $R(x, y)$ in predicting the desired attributes or constraints.

#### Baseline Methods
We will compare the proposed method with the following baseline techniques:
- **Fine-Tuning**: Traditional alignment method that requires retraining the LLM with human feedback.
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Method that optimizes the LLM policy using human preferences as rewards.
- **DiffPO**: Diffusion-styled preference optimization method for efficient inference-time alignment.
