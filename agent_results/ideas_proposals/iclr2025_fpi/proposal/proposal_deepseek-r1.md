### 2. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Large language models (LLMs) require alignment with human preferences and safety constraints to ensure their outputs are useful, ethical, and contextually appropriate. Traditional alignment methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely on fine-tuning model parameters. However, RLHF suffers from computational inefficiency, instability during training, and over-optimization of reward metrics, limiting its adaptability to dynamic user requirements. Recent advances in inference-time alignment methods propose updating generation trajectories using reward-guided sampling, enabling control without retraining model weights. Diffusion models, which iteratively refine samples through a learned denoising process, offer a natural framework for such alignment by blending stochastic dynamics with gradient-based updates.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research aims to:  
1. Develop a token-level diffusion sampling method that incorporates target density (e.g., safety or quality metrics) during inference to align LLM outputs.  
2. Design a lightweight, reward-aware transition kernel to guide the denoising process, enabling efficient sampling from the joint distribution of the base LLM and target reward.  
3. Validate the method’s ability to balance alignment quality, computational efficiency, and output diversity across tasks like safety alignment and style adjustment.  

**Significance**  
The proposed method addresses limitations in existing alignment approaches by:  
- Eliminating the need for costly LLM fine-tuning.  
- Enabling real-time adaptation to diverse constraints (e.g., user preferences, safety rules).  
- Reducing computational overhead compared to iterative RLHF optimization.  
If successful, it could democratize the deployment of aligned LLMs in dynamic applications such as chatbots, content moderation, and personalized AI.

### 3. **Methodology**  

#### 3.1 **Method Overview**  
The proposed framework combines diffusion-driven denoising with target density optimization using a three-step approach:  
1. **Token-Level Diffusion Process**: Introduce noise into the token sequence over discrete timesteps and denoise it iteratively.  
2. **Reward-Aware Transition Kernel**: At each step, adjust the denoising direction using gradients from a reward model.  
3. **Adaptive Noise Scheduling**: Train a lightweight neural network to dynamically regulate noise levels for efficient convergence.  

#### 3.2 **Mathematical Framework**  

**Target Distribution**  
Define the target distribution as a product of the base LLM’s output probability $p_{\text{base}}(x)$ and an exponentiated reward $r(x)$:  
$$p_{\text{target}}(x) \propto p_{\text{base}}(x) \cdot \exp\left(\lambda r(x)\right),$$  
where $\lambda$ controls the reward strength.  

**Forward Process**  
Inject Gaussian noise into the token sequence $x_0$ over $T$ steps:  
$$q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}\left(x_t; \sqrt{\alpha_t} x_{t-1}, (1 - \alpha_t) I\right),$$  
where $\alpha_t \in [0, 1]$ is a learned noise schedule.  

**Reverse Process**  
Denoise the sequence by sampling from a reward-guided transition kernel $p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t, r)$:  
$$p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t, r) \propto p_{\text{base}}(x_{t-1}) \cdot \exp\left(\beta_t \nabla_{x_{t-1}} r(x_{t}) \right) \cdot \mathcal{N}\left(x_t; \mu_\theta(x_{t}), \Sigma_\theta(x_t)\right).$$  
Here, $\mu_\theta$ and $\Sigma_\theta$ are predicted by a neural network, and $\beta_t$ balances the reward gradient’s influence.  

**Training the Transition Kernel**  
Optimize $\theta$ by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the learned and target distributions:  
$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{x_{1:T} \sim q}\left[ \sum_{t=1}^T \text{KL}\left( p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t, r) \parallel q(x_{t-1} | x_t) \right) \right].$$  

#### 3.3 **Algorithmic Steps**  
1. **Forward Noising**: Corrupt the initial sequence $x_0$ to $x_T$ over $T$ steps.  
2. **Reward Gradient Computation**: At each step $t$, compute $\nabla_{x_t} r(x_t)$.  
3. **Denoising with Guided Transitions**: Update $x_{t-1}$ via:  
   $$x_{t-1} = \mu_\theta(x_t) + \eta_t \nabla_{x_t} \log r(x_t) + \epsilon_t,$$  
   where $\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma_\theta(x_t))$ and $\eta_t$ is a step size from the adaptive scheduler.  
4. **Iterate**: Repeat until $t = 0$.  

#### 3.4 **Experimental Design**  

**Datasets & Baselines**  
- **Datasets**: Human preference datasets (e.g., Anthropic’s HH-RLHF), text style transfer corpora, and safety benchmarks.  
- **Baselines**: RLHF, DiffPO (arXiv:2503.04240), SMC-based alignment (arXiv:2501.05803), and training-free Demon (arXiv:2410.05760).  

**Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Alignment Quality**: Reward scores (e.g., BLEURT, safety classifiers).  
- **Efficiency**: Latency per token, FLOPs.  
- **Diversity**: Self-BLEU, distinct-n.  
- **Robustness**: Cross-task generalization and variance in reward scores.  

**Implementation**  
- Use pretrained LLMs (LLaMA-3, GPT-2) and initialize the transition kernel as a 2-layer transformer.  
- Train on 8xA100 GPUs, with $\lambda=0.7$ and $T=10$ steps for efficiency.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. A diffusion-based sampler that aligns LLM outputs with target rewards at inference time, reducing alignment latency by 30–50% compared to fine-tuning.  
2. Empirical validation showing improved reward scores (10–15% higher than SMC-based methods) while maintaining text diversity.  
3. Analysis of trade-offs between noise schedule configurations and alignment performance.  

**Impact**  
- **AI Safety**: Enable real-time mitigation of harmful outputs without sacrificing model versatility.  
- **Accessibility**: Permit resource-constrained users to align LLMs without extensive compute.  
- **Theoretical Advancement**: Bridge gaps between diffusion models, optimal transport, and control theory.
