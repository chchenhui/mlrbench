Title: Transport-Guided Score Diffusion Sampler

Motivation:  
Sampling high-dimensional unnormalized distributions is a bottleneck in Bayesian inference, molecular simulation, and inference-time alignment of generative models. Classical MCMC methods mix slowly and require expensive gradient computations. Score-based diffusion models promise scalable sampling but lack built-in efficiency controls to traverse complex landscapes.

Main Idea:  
We propose a hybrid sampler that integrates optimal transport (OT) control into score-based diffusion. First, a neural score network ùë†Œ∏ estimates ‚àá_x log p(x). Simultaneously, a transport network Tœï learns a coarse map from a simple base measure to the target via Sinkhorn regularization. At sampling time, we solve a controlled SDE  
dx = [sŒ∏(x) + Œ±(x)¬∑(Tœï(x) ‚Äì x)] dt + ‚àö2 dW,  
where Œ±(x) is a learned scalar field balancing score-driven drift and OT control. We train Œ± via a trajectory-level KL objective, encouraging fast convergence. Expected outcomes include 5‚Äì10√ó speedups in effective sample size on Bayesian logistic regression, protein folding toy models, and LLM alignment tasks. This framework unifies transport theory and score-based methods, offering a general, tunable sampler for diverse unnormalized densities.
