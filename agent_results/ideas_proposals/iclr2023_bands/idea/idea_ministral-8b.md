### Title: Cross-Domain Analysis of Backdoor Attacks and Defenses

### Motivation
Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to machine learning models across various domains. While extensive research has been conducted in computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and federated learning (FL), the connection between these domains remains unexplored. Understanding the similarities and differences in backdoor attacks across domains is crucial for developing robust defenses. This research aims to bridge the gap between different domains and enhance the security of machine learning models.

### Main Idea
This research proposes a cross-domain analysis of backdoor attacks and defenses. The methodology involves:
1. **Identifying Common Patterns**: Analyze backdoor attacks in CV, NLP, and FL to identify common patterns and triggers.
2. **Developing Cross-Domain Defenses**: Create defense mechanisms that can be adapted across different domains, leveraging the identified patterns.
3. **Evaluating Stealthiness and Practicality**: Measure the stealthiness and practicality of backdoor attacks in different domains and assess the performance of existing defense techniques.
4. **General Defense Framework**: Develop a general defense framework that can be applied to a variety of backdoor attacks, including unseen ones.

Expected outcomes include:
- A comprehensive understanding of backdoor attacks across domains.
- Adaptable defense mechanisms that can be applied to different domains.
- Improved security measures for machine learning models in real-world applications.

Potential impact:
- Enhanced security for machine learning models in various domains.
- Improved trustworthiness of AI systems.
- Reduced risk of malicious behaviors in deployed systems.
