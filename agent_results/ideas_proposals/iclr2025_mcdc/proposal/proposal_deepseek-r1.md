## 2. Introduction  

### Background  
Modern deep learning has achieved remarkable success by scaling model size and data, but this "bigger is better" paradigm is increasingly unsustainable. Large models require immense computational resources, exacerbate carbon footprints, and are discarded entirely when deprecated, wasting accumulated knowledge. Current architectures are monolithic, where functionality is entangled within parameters, making selective updates prone to catastrophic forgetting. In software engineering, modular design enables code reusability and maintainability; similarly, biological systems leverage modularity to adapt efficiently to new tasks. Despite these advantages, machine learning models rarely adopt modular principles, leaving significant potential untapped for collaborative, decentralized, and sustainable development.

### Research Objectives  
This research proposes a decentralized framework to address these challenges through **modular knowledge distillation** and **continual learning**. The objectives are:  
1. Design a decentralized network of reusable, specialized expert modules.  
2. Develop a knowledge preservation protocol to transfer critical parameters from deprecated models to new architectures.  
3. Create an entropy-based dynamic routing mechanism for task-adaptive module composition.  
4. Validate the framework’s ability to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while maintaining computational efficiency.  

### Significance  
This approach offers three transformative benefits:  
1. **Sustainability**: Reuse of specialized modules reduces retraining costs and computational waste.  
2. **Collaboration**: Decentralized architecture enables distributed development of modules across teams.  
3. **Continual Adaptation**: Dynamic routing and knowledge preservation ensure seamless integration of new tasks without forgetting prior knowledge.

## 3. Methodology  

### 3.1 Framework Overview  
The framework consists of four components:  
1. **Decentralized Modular Architecture**: A network of peers hosting specialized modules (experts).  
2. **Knowledge Preservation Protocol**: Identifies and transfers critical parameters across model generations.  
3. **Entropy-Guided Dynamic Router**: Selects experts based on input characteristics and module specialization.  
4. **Continual Learning Pipeline**: Integrates new tasks while preserving prior knowledge.  

### 3.2 Data Collection and Preparation  
- **Datasets**: Split-CIFAR100 (10 tasks), CORe50 (continuous object recognition), Split-ImageNet (20 tasks).  
- **Preprocessing**: Task sequences with non-overlapping classes to simulate continual learning scenarios.  

### 3.3 Algorithmic Components  

#### **A. Modular Architecture Initialization**  
Each peer hosts a set of modules $\{M_1, M_2, ..., M_k\}$, initialized either randomly or via pre-trained models. Modules are optimized for distinct sub-tasks (e.g., image classification subsets).  

#### **B. Knowledge Distillation Protocol**  
For a deprecated model $T$ (teacher) and new module $M_i$ (student), transfer knowledge using:  
**Loss Function**:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}} = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{D}} \text{KL}\left(T(x) \parallel M_i(x)\right) + \lambda \cdot \Omega(\theta_{M_i}),  
$$  
where $\Omega(\theta_{M_i})$ is an $L_2$ regularization term.  

**Parameter Preservation**:  
Compute Fisher Information Matrix $F$ for $T$ to identify critical parameters:  
$$
F_j = \mathbb{E}_{x \in \mathcal{D}} \left[ \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(T(x))}{\partial \theta_j} \right)^2 \right],  
$$  
transferring parameters with $F_j > \tau$ (a threshold) to initialize $M_i$.  

#### **C. Entropy-Based Dynamic Routing**  
The router $R$ computes module activation probabilities using entropy:  
1. For input $x$, compute module-wise outputs $\{y_1, ..., y_k\}$.  
2. Compute entropy for each module’s class distribution $H(M_i(x)) = -\sum p(y_i) \log p(y_i)$.  
3. Assign routing weights inversely proportional to entropy:  
$$
w_i = \frac{\exp(-H(M_i(x)))}{\sum_{j=1}^k \exp(-H(M_j(x)))}.  
$$  
4. Final prediction: $\hat{y} = \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \cdot M_i(x)$.  

**Sparsity Regularization**: Minimize the number of active modules per input via $L_1$ loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{sparse}} = \sum_{i=1}^k |w_i|.
$$  

#### **D. Decentralized Training**  
1. **Local Training**: Peers train modules on their assigned tasks using $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{\text{sparse}}$.  
2. **Module Sharing**: Periodically broadcast modules to neighbors.  
3. **Consensus Update**: Aggregate parameters of duplicate modules using federated averaging:  
$$
\theta_{M_i} \leftarrow \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N \theta_{M_i}^{(j)}.
$$  

### 3.4 Experimental Design  

#### **Baselines**  
1. **Monolithic Models**: ResNet-50, ViT-Base.  
2. **Continual Learning Methods**: EWC, Synaptic Intelligence.  
3. **Modular Approaches**: DIMAT, Modular Neural Networks (arXiv:2305.12345).  

#### **Metrics**  
1. **Average Accuracy**: Accuracy across all tasks post-training.  
2. **Forgetting Measure**: Difference between peak and final task accuracy.  
3. **Module Specialization Score**: Entropy of module activation across tasks.  
4. **Training Efficiency**: GPU hours and communication costs.  

#### **Ablation Studies**  
- Impact of entropy-based routing vs. random routing.  
- Effect of Fisher-based parameter preservation.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Expected Outcomes  
1. **Improved Continual Learning Performance**: The framework will achieve higher average accuracy (15–20% improvement over EWC) and lower forgetting (<5% degradation).  
2. **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Reduced training costs (30–50% fewer GPU hours vs. monolithic models).  
3. **Quantifiable Module Specialization**: Entropy scores confirming distinct expert roles (e.g., modules with $H(M_i) < 1.5$ for specific tasks).  

### Broader Impact  
- **Environmental Sustainability**: Lower computational costs align with green AI initiatives.  
- **Democratized AI Development**: Decentralized modules enable collaborative, open-source model development.  
- **Applications**: Adaptable to robotics (lifelong adaptation), healthcare (personalized models), and NLP (dynamic task routing).
