**Title:** Router-Aware Dynamic Quantization for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs

**Motivation:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) improve LLM efficiency via sparse activation, but their total parameter size remains a bottleneck. Standard quantization applied uniformly can harm MoE performance, potentially degrading specialized experts or miscalibrated routing. This research aims to develop a quantization strategy that synergizes with the dynamic, sparse nature of MoEs for better efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

**Main Idea:** We propose a dynamic quantization scheme where the precision (bit-width) used for an activated expert depends on the router's confidence score for the input token. When the router output has high confidence (low entropy) for selecting specific experts, these experts' computations (weights and/or activations) can use aggressive, lower-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit). Conversely, when the router exhibits uncertainty (high entropy), indicating a more complex or ambiguous input, the chosen experts utilize higher precision (e.g., 8-bit or FP16) to maintain representational capacity. This context-dependent precision allocation optimizes compute/memory savings while preserving accuracy, especially for difficult tokens. We will implement and evaluate this on standard MoE architectures and benchmarks, measuring performance against static quantization baselines.
