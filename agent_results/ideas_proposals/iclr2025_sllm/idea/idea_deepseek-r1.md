**Title:** Dynamic Mixed-Precision Quantization for Hardware-Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Inference  

**Motivation:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) leverage sparse activation for computational efficiency, but their large parameter counts and dynamic expert selection create memory and latency bottlenecks during inference. Traditional quantization techniques, which apply uniform bit-widths, fail to exploit the inherent sparsity and activation variability among experts, limiting their effectiveness. Bridging MoE sparsity with adaptive quantization can unlock scalable, cost-effective deployment on resource-constrained hardware.  

**Main Idea:** This work proposes a *dynamic mixed-precision quantization* framework where each expert’s parameters are quantized to variable bit-widths based on their activation frequency and contribution to model outputs. Rarely activated experts are aggressively quantized (e.g., 4-bit), minimizing memory use, while critical experts retain higher precision (e.g., 8-bit) to preserve accuracy. A lightweight reinforcement learning policy, trained via hardware-in-the-loop optimization, selects optimal bit-widths per expert by balancing task performance, inference speed, and energy costs. The system co-designs the MoE architecture and quantization scheme during training to ensure robustness to precision shifts. Expected outcomes include 2–3x faster inference and 40% lower memory usage compared to static quantization, with <1% accuracy drop. This approach bridges sparsity-aware algorithms with hardware efficiency, enabling scalable deployment of large MoEs on edge devices or cost-sensitive cloud platforms.
