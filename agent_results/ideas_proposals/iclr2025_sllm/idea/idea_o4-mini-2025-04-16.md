Title: QuantSparse MoE – Joint Quantization and Sparsity for Efficient Inference

Motivation:
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models reduce compute by routing inputs to specialized experts but still suffer from large memory footprints and high bandwidth demands. While quantization and weight sparsity each yield efficiency gains, treating them in isolation underutilizes hardware potential. A unified approach can compound savings and enable MoE deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Main Idea:
QuantSparse MoE introduces per-expert learnable quantization bitwidths and binary sparsity masks, optimized jointly via differentiable relaxations (Gumbel-softmax for bit allocation, L0 regularization for pruning). We augment the standard MoE training objective with a resource-aware penalty that discourages high-bit or dense experts. During inference, the gating network simultaneously selects experts and dispatches bit-width/sparsity configurations, feeding into mixed-precision sparse kernels on existing accelerators. We further employ knowledge distillation to recover any accuracy loss. On language-model and multitask benchmarks, QuantSparse MoE is expected to deliver 3× faster inference, 5× smaller memory usage, and within 1% of baseline perplexity. This framework paves the way for energy-efficient, interpretable, and modular MoEs in both cloud and edge settings.
