# Dynamic Mixed-Precision Quantization for Hardware-Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Inference  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Large Language Models (LLMs) and other neural architectures have achieved remarkable performance across natural language processing, vision, and multimodal tasks. However, their computational demands during inference pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) have emerged as a promising solution by introducing sparsity through dynamic expert selection, where only a subset of model parameters is activated per input. This enables scalability while maintaining performance, yet the sheer size of MoEs—often comprising hundreds of billions of parameters—still results in memory bottlenecks, energy inefficiencies, and latency issues. For instance, GLaM achieves scalability through MoEs but faces inference costs dominated by loading large expert matrices. Similarly, OLMoE leverages sparsity for language modeling but encounters hardware limitations when extreme quantization disrupts efficiency.  

Quantization has been widely adopted to reduce model size and accelerate inference by representing weights and activations in lower-precision formats (e.g., 8-bit integers instead of 32-bit floats). However, traditional quantization techniques apply uniform bit-widths across all model components, ignoring the heterogeneous importance of experts in MoEs. Rarely activated experts, which have minimal impact on model outputs, could tolerate higher compression at negligible cost to accuracy, whereas critical experts demand higher precision to preserve predictive quality. This mismatch between static quantization and MoE dynamics motivates our research: a *dynamic mixed-precision quantization* framework that adapts bit-widths per expert based on activation patterns and hardware constraints.  

### Research Challenges and Objectives  
A central challenge lies in optimally allocating precision across experts. Static approaches like MoQE or MiLo apply low-bit quantization uniformly, risking accuracy degradation in pivotal experts and underutilizing compression potential in less active ones. Additionally, hardware inefficiencies arise from extreme quantization, as noted in MiLo’s 3-bit kernels, which require specialized implementations to avoid latency penalties. Dynamic allocation must balance:  
1. **Accuracy preservation** in high-impact experts,  
2. **Maximizing compression** in low-impact experts,  
3. **Hardware compatibility** (e.g., aligned with SIMD vector widths and memory fetch granularities).  

To address these challenges, we propose:  
1. A *dynamic mixed-precision quantization* algorithm that assigns variable bit-widths (e.g., 4-bit vs. 8-bit) to experts based on their activation frequency and contribution to outputs.  
2. A reinforcement learning (RL) policy trained via hardware-in-the-loop optimization to determine optimal bit-widths while adhering to latency, energy, and memory budgets.  
3. A co-design approach integrating quantization-aware training (QAT) with MoE architecture modifications to ensure robustness against precision shifts.  

### Significance  
This work bridges sparsity in MoEs with adaptive quantization, enabling efficient deployment of large models on edge devices and cloud platforms. By dynamically adapting quantization levels, our approach reduces memory bandwidth requirements and computational overhead without sacrificing accuracy. This aligns with the workshop’s goals of advancing sparsity-driven efficiency across algorithm, hardware, and system dimensions. Key innovations include:  
- Hardware-aware RL for bit-width selection,  
- Dynamic quantization that respects expert importance,  
- Co-design strategies to maintain performance under mixed precision.  

## 2. Methodology  

### Framework Overview  
Our methodology integrates four components:  
1. **Expert Importance Analysis**: Quantify each expert’s contribution using activation frequency and gradient-based sensitivity.  
2. **Dynamic Bit-Width Allocation**: Train an RL policy to assign bit-widths per expert by balancing cost (latency/energy) and accuracy.  
3. **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**: Ensure model robustness to mixed precision via differentiable quantization approximations.  
4. **Hardware-In-The-Loop Evaluation**: Optimize for platform-specific constraints (e.g., GPU tensor cores, TPU vector units).  

### Dynamic Quantization Algorithm  

#### Expert Characterization  
Let $\mathcal{E} = \{E_1, E_2, \dots, E_K\}$ denote the $K$ experts in an MoE layer. For each expert $k$, we compute:  
1. **Activation frequency**: $f_k = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{1}(E_k \text{ active on input } x_i)$, where $N$ is the batch size.  
2. **Sensitivity score**: $s_k = \|\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_{E_k}}\|$, the gradient magnitude of expert parameters $W_{E_k}$.  

These metrics are aggregated over a calibration dataset $\mathcal{D}_{\text{calib}}$ to estimate importance.  

#### Bit-Width Selection with Reinforcement Learning  
We train a policy $\pi_\theta(b_k | E_k)$ to assign a bit-width $b_k \in \{4, 6, 8\}$ to expert $k$, optimized via policy gradient methods. The reward function $r(\pi_\theta)$ combines:  
- **Accuracy impact**: $\Delta \text{Acc} = \text{Acc}_{\text{dyn}} - \text{Acc}_{\text{baseline}}$,  
- **Latency reduction**: $\Delta T = \frac{T_{\text{dyn}}}{T_{\text{baseline}}}$,  
- **Memory savings**: $\Delta M = \frac{M_{\text{dyn}}}{M_{\text{baseline}}}$.  

The optimization objective is:  
$$
\theta^* = \arg\max_\theta \left(\mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta}[w_1 \cdot \Delta \text{Acc} + w_2 \cdot \log(\Delta T) + w_3 \cdot \log(\Delta M)]\right),
$$
where $w_1, w_2, w_3$ are importance weights.  

### Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)  
To mitigate accuracy loss from dynamic quantization, we adopt a differentiable approximation of quantized weights:  
Let $W_{E_k} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ be the weight matrix of expert $k$. For bit-width $b_k$, we define:  
$$
W_{E_k}^{\text{quant}} = \text{clamp}\left(\text{round}\left(W_{E_k} \cdot \frac{2^{b_k-1} - 1}{\max(|W_{E_k}|)}\right), -2^{b_k-1}, 2^{b_k-1} - 1\right).
$$
During QAT, gradients propagate through the *straight-through estimator* (STE), approximating the gradient of true quantization:  
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_{E_k}} = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_{E_k}^{\text{quant}}} & \text{if } |W_{E_k}| \leq \text{scale}, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

### Hardware Co-Design  
We simulate hardware characteristics using tools like TIM-VLIW (for GPU/TPU latency) and estimate energy via approximate dynamic power models. For a target hardware $H$, the RL policy maximizes:  
$$
r(\theta) = w_1 \cdot \frac{\text{Acc}(\pi_\theta)}{\text{Acc}_0} - w_2 \cdot \frac{T(\pi_\theta)}{T_0} - w_3 \cdot \frac{E(\pi_\theta)}{E_0},
$$
where $T_0, E_0$ are baseline metrics.

- **Machine translation**: NLLB-200 as per *No Language Left Behind*.  
- **Vision**: GLaM on ImageNet.  

#### Evaluation Metrics

2. **Memory Savings**: Total model size with mixed precision.  
3. **Accuracy Drop**: vs. full-precision baseline (e.g., GLaM: 0.7% drop threshold).  
4. **Energy Efficiency**: Estimated via hardware-specific power models.  

#### Baselines  
1. Uniform 8-bit quantization (MC-MoE).  
2. Static mixed-precision allocation (MoQa).  
3. Layer-wise quantization (MoQE).
