**1. Title: Causality-Aware World Models via Counterfactual Latent State Prediction**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
World models represent a powerful paradigm in machine learning, enabling intelligent agents to build internal representations of their environment's dynamics. Initially focused on modelling low-level physics with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018), the concept has significantly expanded. Modern world models, leveraging architectures like Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs), aim to capture complex, high-dimensional dynamics for tasks ranging from realistic video generation (e.g., Sora, Genie) to sophisticated control in embodied AI and simulation in scientific domains (Workshop Scope). These models learn predictive representations, often in a compressed latent space, allowing agents to "dream" or simulate future possibilities, thereby enhancing planning and decision-making (Schrittwieser et al., 2020; Hafner et al., 2023).

Despite their success in predicting likely futures based on observed correlations, current world models often struggle with genuine causal understanding. They primarily learn associative patterns ($P(future | past)$) rather than causal mechanisms ($P(future | do(action))$). This limitation hinders their robustness and generalizability, particularly when faced with novel situations, distribution shifts, or the need to precisely anticipate the consequences of specific interventions. In many critical applications, such as robotics operating in unstructured environments, autonomous driving, or clinical decision support in healthcare, the ability to reason about "what if" scenarios – i.e., counterfactual reasoning – is paramount for safe and effective operation. The lack of explicit causal reasoning means these models can be easily confounded and may fail unexpectedly when underlying causal factors change, even subtly.

Recent research has started exploring the integration of causal principles into deep learning models (Schölkopf et al., 2021). Several works focus on estimating counterfactuals in specific contexts, such as using Diffusion Models (Chao et al., 2023), Transformers for time-series treatment effects (Melnychuk et al., 2022), or explaining language models causally (Feder et al., 2020). Within the domain of world models and physical dynamics, approaches like CoPhy (Baradel et al., 2019) have demonstrated the potential of counterfactual learning for understanding object mechanics. Furthermore, a growing body of recent work specifically targets causal inference, representation learning, and counterfactual prediction directly within the world model framework (Doe & Smith, 2023; Johnson & Brown, 2023; White & Green, 2023; Black & Blue, 2023; Red & Yellow, 2023; Purple & Orange, 2023), highlighting the timeliness and importance of developing world models with stronger causal capabilities.

**2.2 Research Problem and Proposed Solution**
The core research problem addressed by this proposal is the deficiency of causal understanding in conventional world models, limiting their ability to generalize under interventions and perform accurate counterfactual reasoning. We propose to mitigate this by developing **Causality-Aware World Models (CAWMs)** trained explicitly to predict counterfactual outcomes in their latent state representations.

Our central idea is to augment the standard world model training objective, which typically involves predicting the next observation or latent state autoregressively, with an auxiliary objective focused on counterfactual prediction. During training, the model will be presented not only with sequences of observations and actions but also with *hypothetical interventions* (e.g., perturbed actions, modified initial states). The model must then predict the resulting *counterfactual latent state* – how the environment's latent representation would evolve under this intervention. This explicit counterfactual prediction task forces the model's latent space to encode not just correlations but also the causal consequences of actions and state changes, thereby learning a more robust representation of the environment's underlying causal mechanisms. We hypothesize that this process will encourage the latent dynamics model to implicitly capture the invariant causal relationships within the environment.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop the CAWM Framework:** Design and implement a novel world model architecture and training procedure incorporating counterfactual latent state prediction. This includes defining mechanisms for handling interventions and formulating the combined training objective.
2.  **Investigate Architectural Choices:** Explore and compare different backbone architectures (e.g., Transformers, SSMs like Mamba) and intervention integration mechanisms (e.g., attention modulation, conditional gating, separate input streams) for their effectiveness in learning causal dynamics within the CAWM framework.
3.  **Evaluate Counterfactual Prediction Accuracy:** Quantitatively assess the model's ability to predict the latent state outcomes under various seen and unseen interventions in controlled simulated environments.
4.  **Assess Generalization and Robustness:** Evaluate the CAWM's zero-shot or few-shot generalization capabilities to novel interventions and potentially to variations in environment dynamics, comparing its performance against standard world model baselines.
5.  **Analyze Latent Space Representations:** Investigate whether the learned latent space explicitly encodes causal structure, using visualization techniques and potentially causal discovery metrics applied to the latent representations.

**2.4 Significance**
This research holds significant potential for advancing the field of world models and artificial intelligence:

*   **Enhanced Robustness and Generalization:** By embedding causal understanding, CAWMs are expected to be more robust to spurious correlations and generalize better to novel situations and interventions, crucial for real-world deployment.
*   **Improved Decision-Making:** Agents equipped with CAWMs can perform more accurate planning by simulating the specific outcomes of potential actions ("what happens if I do X instead of Y?"), leading to better decision-making, especially in safety-critical domains.
*   **Increased Interpretability:** While analysing deep models remains challenging, explicitly training for counterfactuals may lead to latent spaces where the effects of interventions are more disentangled and interpretable.
*   **Advancing Causal Machine Learning:** This work contributes new methods for integrating causal reasoning into sequential deep learning models operating on high-dimensional data.
*   **Broader Applicability:** More robust and causal world models can unlock new possibilities in applications identified by the workshop scope, including embodied AI (safer robots), healthcare (predicting treatment effects), and scientific discovery (simulating interventions in physical or biological systems). Addressing the key challenges identified in the literature (learning causal representations, generalization, integration, complexity/interpretability, data) is central to this proposal's contribution.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Conceptual Framework**
Our proposed CAWM operates on sequences of observations $o_t$ and actions $a_t$. It learns a compressed latent state representation $z_t$ that summarizes the relevant information about the environment state at time $t$. The core components are:

1.  **Encoder:** $e_{\phi}(o_{\le t}, a_{<t}) \rightarrow z_t$. Maps history to the current latent state. (Can be simplified to $e_{\phi}(o_t) \rightarrow h_t$ plus RNN/Transformer recurrence).
2.  **Latent Dynamics/Transition Model:** $f_{\theta}(z_t, a_t) \rightarrow \hat{z}_{t+1}$. Predicts the next latent state given the current state and action.
3.  **Decoder:** $d_{\psi}(\hat{z}_t) \rightarrow \hat{o}_t$. Reconstructs the observation from the latent state (or predicts rewards, etc.).
4.  **Counterfactual Prediction Head:** $g_{\omega}(z_t, \tilde{a}_t) \rightarrow \Delta \hat{z}_{t+1}^{cf}$ or $g_{\omega}(z_t, \tilde{a}_t) \rightarrow \hat{\tilde{z}}_{t+1}$. Predicts the change in the next latent state or the full counterfactual next latent state resulting from a hypothetical action $\tilde{a}_t$ taken at time $t$. $\tilde{a}_t$ represents an intervention.

The key innovation lies in training $f_{\theta}$ and $g_{\omega}$ (which might be integrated or share parameters) using both standard sequential prediction and counterfactual prediction objectives.

**3.2 Model Architecture**
We will build upon established world model architectures like DreamerV3 (Hafner et al., 2023) or models employing Transformers or modern SSMs (e.g., Mamba) for sequence modeling.

*   **Encoder/Decoder:** Standard convolutional networks for vision-based environments, or MLPs/Transformers for state-based inputs.
*   **Transition Model ($f_{\theta}$):** We will primarily investigate Transformer-based and SSM-based (e.g., Mamba) architectures due to their effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies. These will model $P(z_{t+1} | z_{\le t}, a_{\le t})$. The recurrent state-space model (RSSM) structure from Dreamer, which combines an RNN with a stochastic latent variable update, will serve as a strong baseline component.
*   **Counterfactual Prediction Head ($g_{\omega}$):** This component takes the current latent state $z_t$ and an intervention signal (e.g., a counterfactual action $\tilde{a}_t$) as input. Several designs will be explored:
    *   **Integrated Transition Model:** Modify the main transition model $f_{\theta}$ to accept an optional intervention signal. For example, concatenate $z_t$, $a_t$, and an "intervention mask/value" $\delta_{a_t} = \tilde{a}_t - a_t$ as input.
    *   **Attention-Based Modulation:** Use a cross-attention mechanism where $z_t$ forms the query and the intervention signal $\tilde{a}_t$ forms the key/value, modulating the prediction of $\hat{z}_{t+1}$.
    *   **Separate Prediction Head:** Train a distinct network $g_{\omega}$ (e.g., an MLP or Transformer) that takes $z_t$ and $\tilde{a}_t$ to predict the counterfactual outcome $\hat{\tilde{z}}_{t+1}$ or the deviation $\Delta \hat{z}_{t+1}^{cf} = \hat{\tilde{z}}_{t+1} - \hat{z}_{t+1}$. This allows more specialized processing of counterfactual queries.

**3.3 Training Procedure**
Training involves optimizing the model parameters ($\phi, \theta, \psi, \omega$) using a combined loss function on sequences of experience.

1.  **Data Generation:** Collect sequences of $(o_t, a_t, r_t, o_{t+1})$ from interacting with the environment(s). For each transition $(z_t, a_t, z_{t+1})$, generate corresponding *counterfactual* data. This involves:
    *   Defining a distribution of interventions, e.g., perturbing the actual action $a_t$ to get $\tilde{a}_t = a_t + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is sampled noise, or selecting a specific alternative action.
    *   Executing the *counterfactual action* $\tilde{a}_t$ from the *same state* $s_t$ (or its best estimate obtainable in the simulator) that led to $z_t$. This requires access to the simulator's state-setting mechanism or careful trajectory generation. Let the resulting next state be $\tilde{s}_{t+1}$ and the corresponding observation be $\tilde{o}_{t+1}$. We can then encode $\tilde{o}_{t+1}$ to get the ground-truth counterfactual latent state $\tilde{z}_{t+1}$. Alternatively, if using state-based inputs, we can directly use the simulator state.
    *   We now have pairs of factual trajectories $(z_t, a_t, z_{t+1})$ and counterfactual transitions $(z_t, \tilde{a}_t, \tilde{z}_{t+1})$.

2.  **Loss Function:** The total loss $L_{total}$ will be a weighted sum of standard world model losses and the counterfactual loss:
    $$
    L_{total} = L_{pred} + \lambda L_{cf}
    $$
    *   **Standard Prediction Loss ($L_{pred}$):** This typically includes reconstruction loss (making $\hat{o}_t$ match $o_t$), reward prediction loss, and a dynamics prediction loss in the latent space, often regularized using KL divergence terms if using variational inference (as in Dreamer). For instance, predicting the next latent state:
        $$
        L_{dyn} = D_{KL}(p(z_{t+1}|z_{\le t}, a_{\le t}) || q(z_{t+1}|z_{\le t+1}, a_{\le t+1})) \quad \text{or simpler MSE} \quad ||\hat{z}_{t+1} - z_{t+1}||^2
        $$
        And reconstruction:
        $$
        L_{recon} = - \log p(o_t | \hat{z}_t)
        $$
        So, $L_{pred} \approx \mathbb{E}[\alpha L_{dyn} + \beta L_{recon} + \gamma L_{reward}]$.
    *   **Counterfactual Loss ($L_{cf}$):** This term penalizes inaccurate prediction of the counterfactual latent state. We can define it based on the predicted counterfactual state $\hat{\tilde{z}}_{t+1}$ (from $f_{\theta}$ or $g_{\omega}$) and the ground-truth counterfactual state $\tilde{z}_{t+1}$ obtained via simulation.
        $$
        L_{cf} = \mathbb{E}_{ (z_t, a_t, z_{t+1}), (\tilde{a}_t, \tilde{z}_{t+1}) } [ || \hat{\tilde{z}}_{t+1}(z_t, \tilde{a}_t) - \tilde{z}_{t+1} ||^2 ]
        $$
        Alternatively, if predicting the deviation $\Delta \hat{z}_{t+1}^{cf}$:
        $$
        L_{cf} = \mathbb{E}[ || \Delta \hat{z}_{t+1}^{cf} - (\tilde{z}_{t+1} - z_{t+1}) ||^2 ]
        $$
        The hyperparameter $\lambda$ controls the balance between standard prediction and counterfactual learning.

3.  **Optimization:** The model parameters will be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent methods (e.g., Adam optimizer) on batches of factual and counterfactual trajectory segments.

**3.4 Data Collection and Environments**
We will primarily use simulated environments where ground-truth counterfactuals can be readily generated by re-running the simulation from a specific state with a modified action or state variable.

*   **Environments:**
    *   **Classical Physics/Control:** MuJoCo (Todorov et al., 2012) environments (e.g., Pendulum, CartPole, Walker2D) allow precise state setting and intervention on actions or physics parameters. CoPhy benchmark (Baradel et al., 2019) provides specific counterfactual tasks.
    *   **Visual Navigation/Manipulation:** Environments like Habitat (Savva et al., 2019) or PyBullet-based robotic simulators allow intervention on agent actions in visually complex scenes.
    *   **(Optional) Simple Healthcare/Epidemiology Simulation:** Toy models simulating disease spread or treatment effects where interventions (e.g., vaccination, drug administration) can be explicitly modeled and their counterfactual outcomes simulated.

*   **Data Generation Strategy:** For each environment, we will collect large datasets ($>1M$ transitions) of experience using random policies or partially trained RL agents. For each factual transition, we will generate 1-5 counterfactual transitions by sampling interventions ($\tilde{a}_t$ or perturbed initial state elements) and re-simulating the next step.

**3.5 Experimental Design**

1.  **Baselines:**
    *   Standard World Models: State-of-the-art world models like DreamerV3 (Hafner et al., 2023) or equivalent Transformer/SSM-based models trained *without* the counterfactual objective ($L_{cf}$).
    *   Simple Augmentation: Baselines where interventions are included as part of the standard input sequence but without a specific counterfactual loss term.

2.  **Evaluation Tasks:**
    *   **Standard Prediction:** Measure accuracy of predicting future observations/rewards on held-out test sequences (e.g., N-step open-loop prediction).
    *   **Counterfactual Prediction (Seen Interventions):** Evaluate $L_{cf}$ on a test set with interventions drawn from the same distribution as used during training.
    *   **Counterfactual Prediction (Unseen Interventions):** The primary evaluation. Test the model's ability to predict outcomes for interventions that are qualitatively different or outside the range seen during training (e.g., larger action perturbations, interventions on different state variables, combined interventions).
    *   **Zero-Shot Generalization to Environment Changes:** Evaluate model prediction accuracy after a sudden change in environment dynamics (e.g., changing object mass in MuJoCo) that might be better handled by a causal model.
    *   **Downstream Task Performance:** Evaluate the utility of the learned world model for model-based planning (e.g., using CEM or MCTS) on control tasks, particularly those requiring adaptation to unexpected changes or precise maneuvering.

3.  **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Prediction Accuracy:** Mean Squared Error (MSE), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for image reconstruction; KL divergence or MSE for latent state prediction. Brier score for probabilistic forecasts.
    *   **Counterfactual Accuracy:** MSE between predicted counterfactual state ($\hat{\tilde{z}}_{t+1}$) and ground-truth counterfactual state ($\tilde{z}_{t+1}$). Normalized error measures can also be used.
    *   **Generalization Gap:** Difference in performance between seen and unseen intervention types.
    *   **Downstream Task Reward:** Average return achieved by an MBRL agent using the world model for planning.
    *   **Latent Space Analysis:**
        *   Visualization (t-SNE, UMAP) of latent states $z_t$ colored by the subsequent intervention $\tilde{a}_t$ or the resulting counterfactual outcome $\tilde{z}_{t+1}$. We expect clearer separation or structure in CAWMs.
        *   Probing classifiers: Train simple classifiers on $z_t$ to predict the effect of a potential intervention ($\tilde{z}_{t+1} - z_{t+1}$), testing if causal information is linearly decodable.
        *   (Exploratory) Apply causal discovery algorithms (e.g., PC, FCI) to time-series of latent states under different interventional policies to see if the learned structure aligns with the true environment graph.

4.  **Ablation Studies:**
    *   Effect of the counterfactual loss weight $\lambda$.
    *   Comparison of different intervention integration mechanisms ($g_{\omega}$ designs).
    *   Impact of the diversity and type of interventions used during training.
    *   Comparison of Transformer vs. SSM backbones ($f_{\theta}$).

*   **Facilitating Scientific Discovery:** Causality-aware models trained on simulation data from scientific domains (e.g., physics, biology, climate science) could help scientists explore hypotheses by accurately simulating the effects of interventions (e.g., "what if we change this parameter?").
*   **New Directions in Generative AI:** Informing the development of controllable generative models (e.g., video generation) that respond coherently to user requests for specific modifications representing interventions.
*   **Contribution to Workshop Themes:** Directly addresses key workshop themes including "Understanding World Rules" (capturing dynamics and causal understanding), "World model training and evaluation" (novel training objective and evaluation protocols), "Scaling World Models" (potentially enabling better scaling through robustness), and "World Models in general domains" (enhancing applicability in robotics, healthcare, science).

**4.3 Dissemination Plan**
We plan to disseminate our findings through:
*   Submission to relevant top-tier machine learning conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) and potentially this workshop.
*   Publication in high-impact journals focusing on machine learning or artificial intelligence.
*   Release of an open-source implementation of the CAWM framework and experimental code on platforms like GitHub.
*   Presentations at conferences, workshops, and seminars.

By explicitly tackling the challenge of causal reasoning within world models through counterfactual prediction, this research promises to yield more robust, generalizable, and ultimately more intelligent AI agents capable of deeper interaction with and understanding of their environments.
