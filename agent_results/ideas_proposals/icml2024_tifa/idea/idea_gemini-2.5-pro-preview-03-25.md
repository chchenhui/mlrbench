**Title:** Cross-Modal Watermarking for Verifiable AI-Generated Content Provenance

**Motivation:** As Multi-modal Generative Models (MMGMs) like Sora become more capable, differentiating AI-generated content from reality and tracing its origin is critical for combating misinformation and ensuring accountability. Existing watermarking often struggles with cross-modal generation (e.g., text-to-video) and robustness against common manipulations.

**Main Idea:** We propose developing a unified, robust watermarking framework embedded within MMGMs. The core idea is to encode a unique, verifiable identifier directly into the latent space representations *before* content generation across different modalities (text, image, video, audio). This latent watermark, linked to the model version and potentially session/prompt context, would manifest subtly in the generated output of any modality. We will design the embedding to be resilient to standard post-processing (compression, cropping, format changes) and develop decoders capable of extracting the watermark from various media types, even partial or degraded ones. This allows tracing generated content back to its source MMGM reliably.
