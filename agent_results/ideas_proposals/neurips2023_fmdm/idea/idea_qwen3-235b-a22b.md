1. **Title**: Vision-Language Foundation Models as Hierarchical Planners in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning  
2. **Motivation**: Vision-language foundation models (VLMs) excel at perception and reasoning but struggle with sequential decision-making due to a lack of action-centric training. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) agents master control tasks but suffer from poor generalization. Bridging this gap could enable sample-efficient, adaptable agents for complex tasks like robotics and healthcare, where vision, language, and long-term planning intersect.  
3. **Main Idea**: Propose a hierarchical framework where a VLM acts as a high-level planner, generating interpretable subgoals or symbolic plans from multimodal inputs (e.g., visual observations and language commands). A lower-level RL agent translates these plans into primitive actions. The VLM is fine-tuned via model-based RL, leveraging its pre-trained world knowledge to predict action consequences and refine plans using environment feedback. The environment is structured to reward subgoal achievement, enabling the VLM to learn planning without direct action data. Expected outcomes include improved performance on long-horizon tasks (e.g., robotic navigation with language guidance) and better generalization across domains. This approach could unify the strengths of VLMs (broad knowledge, multimodal understanding) and RL (precise control), advancing applications requiring both perception and decision-making.
