**Title:** Action-Aware Pretraining for Foundation Models in Decision Making  

**Motivation:** Foundation models (FMs) excel in vision and language tasks but lack action-oriented training data, limiting their utility in decision-making domains like robotics and control. Bridging this gap is critical to leverage their broad knowledge for sample-efficient, generalizable policies in sequential decision tasks.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a pretraining framework that integrates action dynamics into FMs by training on multi-modal datasets pairing observations (e.g., video, text) with action sequences (e.g., robot controls, game inputs). The model learns to predict actions and future states via self-supervised objectives, such as masked action prediction or contrastive alignment between visual contexts and actions. For scalability, synthetic action-labeled data from simulators or existing RL benchmarks (e.g., D4RL) can augment real-world datasets. Downstream, the pretrained FM can be fine-tuned with reinforcement learning, enabling efficient adaptation to new tasks by leveraging action-aware representations.  

**Expected Outcomes & Impact:** This approach would yield FMs capable of reasoning about actions and dynamics, reducing the sample complexity of RL agents in physical and virtual environments. Applications include robotics, where pretrained models could rapidly adapt to manipulation tasks, and autonomous systems requiring long-horizon planning. The methodology addresses the "action gap" in FMs, unlocking their potential for decision-making with minimal task-specific data.
