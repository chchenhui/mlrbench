# Preserving Robustness During Fine-tuning of Foundation Models: A Knowledge Distillation Approach

## Motivation
While foundation models demonstrate impressive robustness to distribution shifts, this advantage often diminishes during fine-tuning for specialized tasks. This degradation is particularly problematic in high-stakes domains like healthcare and criminal justice, where distribution shifts are inevitable and consequential. Current fine-tuning approaches optimize for in-distribution performance, inadvertently sacrificing the broad knowledge and robustness gained during pre-training. A solution that preserves robustness while enabling task adaptation is urgently needed.

## Main Idea
We propose a knowledge distillation framework that preserves distributional robustness during fine-tuning. Our approach introduces a "robustness teacher" mechanism where the original foundation model acts as a teacher that guides the fine-tuning process. During fine-tuning, we optimize a hybrid loss function that combines task-specific performance with a distillation loss that penalizes deviations from the teacher's predictions on out-of-distribution examples. We generate these examples using controlled perturbations and domain-specific transformations. This approach creates a constrained adaptation space that allows the model to specialize while maintaining its ability to generalize across distribution shifts. We complement this with a novel regularization technique that explicitly preserves activation patterns from the pre-trained model on diverse inputs. This method could substantially reduce the robustness gap in foundation models deployed in specialized domains like medical imaging and natural language processing in legal or healthcare settings.
