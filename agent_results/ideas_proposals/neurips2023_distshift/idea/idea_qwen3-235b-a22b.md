**Title:**  
**Contrastive Adaptation for Robust Generative Modeling Under Distribution Shifts**  

**Motivation:**  
Generative foundation models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains like medicine and law, where target distributions often diverge significantly from their pretraining data. However, existing methods for mitigating distribution shifts in discriminative models are poorly adapted to generative settings, leading to unreliable outputs when prompts or target distributions are underrepresented. Developing robust strategies for generative models under such shifts is critical to ensure their reliability in high-stakes applications.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a contrastive adaptation framework that explicitly aligns the modelâ€™s latent representations with the target distribution during fine-tuning. Our approach involves:  
1. **Synthetic Shift Augmentation**: Generating adversarial or domain-specific samples (e.g., medical jargon, low-resource dialects) to simulate distribution shifts during training.  
2. **Contrastive Learning with Distribution Priors**: Encouraging the model to cluster representations of target-domain data closer while pushing away out-of-distribution samples.  
3. **Dynamic Prompt Calibration**: Adjusting prompts at inference time using lightweight adapters trained on small, curated target-domain data to recalibrate generation.  
We will evaluate this on benchmarks like WILDS and domain-specific datasets (e.g., radiology reports, legal contracts), measuring robustness via distributional metrics (e.g., Wasserstein distance) and task-specific accuracy. Expected outcomes include improved generation quality under shifts and reduced reliance on large-scale retraining. This work bridges a key gap in generative model robustness, enabling safer deployment in critical domains.
