Title  
PAC‐Bayesian Policy Optimization with Uncertainty‐Aware Exploration for Reinforcement Learning  

Introduction  
Background  
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable empirical success in domains ranging from games (e.g. Atari) to robotics. Yet the high sample complexity of state‐of‐the‐art methods (SAC, PPO) often renders them impractical in real‐world interactive settings where data collection is costly or dangerous. A key culprit is unguided exploration—ε‐greedy or entropy‐based noise—lacking principled uncertainty quantification and theoretical guarantees. In parallel, PAC‐Bayesian theory provides distribution‐dependent generalization bounds that can quantify a learner’s uncertainty and relate empirical performance to true risk. Recent works (e.g. Deep Exploration with PAC‐Bayes, PBAC; PAC‐Bayesian SAC) have begun leveraging these bounds for exploration or critic stabilization. However, a unified policy‐optimization framework that explicitly minimizes a PAC‐Bayes bound while guiding exploration by posterior uncertainty remains missing.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a deep RL algorithm that:  
1. Learns a posterior distribution over policies by minimizing a PAC‐Bayes generalization bound adapted to interactive, non‐stationary decision‐making.  
2. Uses posterior variance as an uncertainty measure to guide exploration in a principled, data‐efficient fashion (via Thompson sampling or UCB).  
3. Provides provable sample‐complexity guarantees and demonstrates empirical superiority on benchmark domains (Atari, MuJoCo).  

Significance  
By marrying PAC‐Bayesian theory and modern policy optimization, we expect to achieve:  
– Rigorous sample‐efficiency guarantees for exploration‐exploitation trade‐offs.  
– Robustness to distribution shift and non‐stationary transitions via time‐uniform bounds.  
– A practical deep RL method suitable for high‐dimensional observations and real‐world robotics.  

Methodology  
Problem Setup  
We consider a finite‐horizon Markov decision process (MDP) defined by $(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},P,r,\gamma)$, where $\mathcal{S}$ is the state space, $\mathcal{A}$ the action space, $P(s'|s,a)$ the transition kernel, $r(s,a)\in[0,1]$ the reward, and $\gamma\in(0,1)$ the discount factor. A stochastic policy $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ is parameterized by neural network weights $\theta\in\mathbb{R}^d$. Our goal is to learn a posterior distribution $Q(\theta)$ over policy parameters that maximizes expected cumulative reward while controlling generalization error via PAC‐Bayes bounds.  

PAC‐Bayes Bound for Interactive Learning  
Let $\ell(\theta; \tau)$ denote the negative cumulative reward (loss) of policy $\pi_\theta$ on trajectory $\tau=(s_0,a_0,r_0,\dots,s_{H-1},a_{H-1},r_{H-1})$. Given $n$ sampled trajectories $\{\tau_i\}_{i=1}^n$ under policies drawn i.i.d. from prior $P(\theta)$, define empirical risk  
$$
\hat L(Q) \;=\;\mathbb{E}_{\theta\sim Q}\Big[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \ell(\theta;\tau_i)\Big],
$$  
and true risk  
$$
L(Q)\;=\;\mathbb{E}_{\theta\sim Q}\Big[\mathbb{E}_{\tau\sim \pi_\theta}[\ell(\theta;\tau)]\Big].
$$  
A standard PAC‐Bayes bound (Catoni’s form) states that for any $\lambda>0$, with probability at least $1-\delta$ over the sampling of $\{\tau_i\}$, for all posteriors $Q$ simultaneously:  
$$
L(Q)\;\le\;\hat L(Q)\;+\;\frac{1}{\lambda n}\big[\mathrm{KL}(Q\|P)+\ln\frac{1}{\delta}\big]\;+\;\frac{\lambda V}{2n},
$$  
where $V$ is an upper bound on the loss variance. To accommodate non‐stationarity in trajectories and ensure time‐uniform guarantees, we will draw on the unified recipe for time‐uniform PAC‐Bayes bounds (Chugg et al., 2023), constructing a nonnegative supermartingale $M_t$ to apply Ville’s inequality.  

Variational Posterior Optimization  
We approximate $Q(\theta)$ in a variational family, e.g. a diagonal Gaussian $Q(\theta)=\mathcal{N}(\mu,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma^2))$, and choose a similar form for the prior $P(\theta)=\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_0^2 I)$. Minimizing the upper bound on $L(Q)$ yields the objective:  
$$
\mathcal{J}(\mu,\sigma)\;=\;\hat L(Q)\;+\;\frac{1}{\lambda n}\mathrm{KL}\big(Q\|P\big)\;+\;\frac{\lambda V}{2n}.
$$  
Concretely,  
$$
\mathrm{KL}(Q\|P)\;=\;\sum_{j=1}^d\Big[\frac{\sigma_j^2+\mu_j^2}{2\sigma_0^2}-\frac12\ln\frac{\sigma_j^2}{\sigma_0^2}-\frac12\Big].
$$  
We perform stochastic gradient descent on $(\mu,\sigma)$ by sampling $\theta\sim Q$ via the reparameterization trick $\theta=\mu+\sigma\odot\epsilon$, $\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)$, estimating $\nabla\hat L(Q)$ through Monte Carlo rollouts.  

Uncertainty‐Aware Exploration  
Two principled strategies emerge from the posterior:  
1. Thompson Sampling: At each episode, sample $\theta\sim Q$ and act greedily with $\pi_\theta$.  
2. UCB‐Style Exploration: For state $s$, approximate the variance of the Q‐value:  
   $$
   \hat\sigma_Q^2(s,a)\;=\;\mathrm{Var}_{\theta\sim Q}\big[Q_\theta(s,a)\big],
   $$  
   where $Q_\theta$ is estimated via a value network (trained analogously). Then select   
   $$
   a=\arg\max_{a'}\Big(\hat Q(s,a')+\beta\,\hat\sigma_Q(s,a')\Big),
   $$  
   with exploration coefficient $\beta>0$. We will compare both strategies empirically.  

Handling Distribution Shift and Non‐Stationarity  
To address evolving dynamics $P_t$, we will extend the PAC‐Bayes bound with a time‐uniform guarantee: we treat each batch of trajectories as a timestep $t$ and maintain a supermartingale  
$$
M_t = \exp\Big(\lambda\sum_{i=1}^t[\hat L_i(Q)-L_i(Q)]-\mathrm{KL}(Q\|P)\Big),
$$  
ensuring that with probability $1-\delta$ the cumulative deviation remains bounded for all $t$. We will integrate this bound into our objective to adapt the KL‐penalty over time, promoting robustness to changing transition kernels.  

Algorithmic Steps  
1. Initialize prior variance $\sigma_0^2$, learning rates, KL‐weight $\lambda$, exploration parameter $\beta$.  
2. Initialize $(\mu_0,\sigma_0)$ for posterior $Q_0$.  
3. For iteration $k=1,\dots,K$:  
   a. Sample a batch of policies $\{\theta_j\}_{j=1}^M\sim Q_{k-1}$.  
   b. For each $\theta_j$, collect trajectories $\{\tau_{i,j}\}_{i=1}^n$ by executing the exploration strategy (Thompson or UCB).  
   c. Compute empirical loss gradients $\nabla_{\mu,\sigma}\hat L(Q_{k-1})$ via reparameterization.  
   d. Compute $\nabla_{\mu,\sigma}\mathrm{KL}(Q_{k-1}\|P)$ in closed form.  
   e. Update $(\mu_k,\sigma_k)$ by SGD on $\mathcal{J}$.  
   f. Optionally update the prior or adjust $\lambda$ based on time‐uniform bound slack.  
4. Return final posterior $Q_K$.
