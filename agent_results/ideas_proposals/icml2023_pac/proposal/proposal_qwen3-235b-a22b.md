# PAC-Bayesian Policy Optimization with Uncertainty-Aware Exploration for Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction

### Background
Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms excel at solving complex tasks but often suffer from **sample inefficiency** due to unguided exploration strategies (e.g., ε-greedy). This inefficiency is particularly pronounced in high-dimensional domains like robotics, where environment interactions are costly. While Bayesian methods intuitively address exploration via uncertainty quantification, their theoretical grounding in PAC-Bayesian theory—a framework for probabilistic learning with generalization guarantees—remains underexplored in deep RL. Recent work, such as PAC-Bayesian Actor-Critic (PBAC) and PAC-Bayesian SAC, demonstrates promise in integrating PAC-Bayes bounds into RL for improved exploration and training stability, but gaps persist in addressing **non-stationary dynamics** and scaling to rich observation spaces.

### Research Objectives
1. **Theoretical Objective**: Derive a PAC-Bayes bound for RL that accommodates non-stationary transitions and delayed rewards, leveraging time-uniform analysis techniques.
2. **Algorithmic Objective**: Develop a policy optimization algorithm that explicitly minimizes this bound while balancing exploration-exploitation via uncertainty-aware strategies.
3. **Empirical Objective**: Validate the algorithm’s sample efficiency and robustness on benchmarks like Atari and MuJoCo, surpassing existing methods (SAC, PPO, PBAC).

### Significance
This work bridges the theoretical rigor of PAC-Bayesian learning with practical RL, enabling **safe and efficient exploration** in high-risk domains. By formalizing exploration as uncertainty quantification over policies, we address critical challenges in robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical RL, where unguided exploration is prohibitive.

## Methodology

### PAC-Bayes Framework for RL
We define a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with state space $\mathcal{S}$, action space $\mathcal{A}$, transition kernel $T(s' | s, a)$, and reward function $r(s, a)$. Let $\pi_{\theta}$ denote a stochastic policy parameterized by $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d$. The goal is to learn a posterior distribution $Q(\theta)$ over policies that minimizes the expected cumulative loss $\mathcal{L}(Q)$ while satisfying PAC-Bayes bounds.

#### PAC-Bayes Bound Derivation
We leverage time-uniform bounds from [Chugg et al., 2023], which hold for **non-i.i.d. data** and adaptive sampling. For a dataset $\mathcal{D}_t = \{(s_i, a_i, r_i)\}_{i=1}^t$ collected up to time $t$, the bound states:
$$
\mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim Q}[\mathcal{L}(\theta)] \leq \frac{1}{1-\beta} \left( \mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim Q}[\hat{\mathcal{L}}_{\mathcal{D}_t}(\theta)] + \frac{KL(Q||P) + \log\frac{\Xi_t}{\delta}}{t} \right)
$$
where:
- $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$: True expected loss of policy $\theta$,
- $\hat{\mathcal{L}}_{\mathcal{D}_t}(\theta)$: Empirical loss on $\mathcal{D}_t$,
- $KL(Q||P)$: Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between posterior $Q$ and prior $P$,
- $\beta \in (0,1)$: Trade-off parameter,
- $\Xi_t = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{t})$: Time-dependent scaling factor (from mixture martingales).

The bound accommodates non-stationarity by using a **data-dependent prior** $P_t$ updated every $t$ steps, ensuring validity as the policy evolves.

### Algorithm: PAC-Bayesian Policy Optimization (PBPO)

#### Variational Posterior and Neural Architecture
We model $Q(\theta)$ as a fully factorized Gaussian posterior over neural network weights:
$$
Q(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^d \mathcal{N}(\theta_i | \mu_i, \sigma_i^2),
$$
with variational parameters $\mu_i, \log \sigma_i$. The policy network maps states $s \in \mathcal{S}$ to actions $a \in \mathcal{A}$, parameterized by weights sampled from $Q$. Prior $P(\theta)$ is initialized as a standard normal distribution and updated periodically to track $Q$ (see Section 2.3).

#### Objective Function
The PBPO objective combines bound minimization and entropy regularization:
$$
\mathcal{J}(\mu, \sigma) = \mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim Q} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t r_t \right] + \lambda \cdot \frac{KL(Q||P)}{t} - \eta \cdot \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta} [ \mathcal{H}(a|s) ],
$$
where $\lambda, \eta$ control trade-offs between reward maximization, complexity, and entropy. The gradient of $\mathcal{J}$ is estimated via the **reparameterization trick**:
$$
\nabla_{\mu, \sigma} \mathcal{J} = \mathbb{E}_{\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)} \left[ \nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{J}(\mu + \sigma \circ \epsilon) \cdot \nabla_{\mu, \sigma} (\mu + \sigma \circ \epsilon) \right].
$$

#### Uncertainty-Aware Exploration
States with high posterior variance are prioritized via:
1. **Uncertainty Score**: For state $s$, compute $u(s) = \text{Var}_{\theta \sim Q}[\pi_\theta(a|s)]$.
2. **Exploration Bonus**: Add $b(s) = \alpha \cdot \sqrt{u(s)}$ to the reward function, encouraging visits to uncertain regions.

The exploration bonus coefficient $\alpha$ is annealed during training to shift from exploration to exploitation.

#### Handling Non-Stationary Dynamics
To address distribution shifts, we update the prior $P_t$ every $T$ steps using:
$$
P_{t+T}(\theta) = (1-\eta) Q_t(\theta) + \eta P_t(\theta),
$$
where $\eta$ balances adaptivity and bound tightness. This maintains validity under the time-uniform analysis.

### Experimental Design

#### Datasets and Environments
- **Benchmarks**: Atari (Pong, Breakout), MuJoCo (HalfCheetah, Hopper), and RoboSuite (SawyerReach, SawyerPickPlace).
- **Baselines**: SAC, PPO, PBAC, and PAC-Bayesian SAC.

#### Evaluation Metrics
1. **Sample Efficiency**: Episodes to reach a performance threshold (e.g., 90% of human-score in Atari).
2. **Regret**: $R_T = \sum_{t=0}^T \left( V^*(s_t) - V^\pi(s_t) \right)$, where $V^*$ is the optimal value function.
3. **Generalization**: Performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) environments with shifted dynamics (e.g., perturbed gravity in MuJoCo).

#### Implementation Details
- **Neural Networks**: Two-layer MLP for discrete actions (Atari) and tanh-Gaussian for continuous actions.
- **Hyperparameters**: $\lambda = 0.1$, $\eta = 0.01$, ensemble size 5 for PBAC.
- **Training**: 5 random seeds, Adam optimizer, 200 epochs.
