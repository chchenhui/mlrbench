# Interpretable Deep Learning for Multi-Scale Protein Design

## Motivation
Protein design holds immense potential for addressing medical and environmental challenges, yet current deep learning approaches often function as "black boxes," limiting their practical utility for experimentalists. This disconnect between computational predictions and experimental validation slows the translation of algorithmic advances into real-world applications. Addressing the interpretability gap would enable biologists to understand why specific designs are proposed, assess their feasibility, and iterate more effectively between computational and experimental approaches.

## Main Idea
We propose a multi-scale interpretable framework for protein design that provides explanations at three levels: (1) sequence-level interpretability through attention mechanisms that highlight critical residue positions and their contributions; (2) structural-level interpretability using graph neural networks with built-in explainability to visualize how structural features influence design decisions; and (3) functional-level interpretability that connects sequence/structure to predicted molecular functions. The framework integrates these explanations into an interactive interface where experimentalists can explore design rationales, modify suggestions based on domain knowledge, and provide feedback to improve the model. By incorporating experimental feedback loops and explicitly modeling the uncertainty in predictions, our approach would significantly reduce the number of designs requiring experimental testing while increasing success rates, ultimately accelerating the translation of computational designs into functional biomolecules.
