# Modeling Cognitive Effort in Human Feedback for Robust AI Alignment

## Introduction

Aligning AI agents with human intentions and values is a critical challenge in the safe and ethical application of AI systems. Current approaches, such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Learning from Demonstrations (LfD), often assume that human feedback is rational, unbiased, and consistent, which is frequently violated in practice. This research aims to address this gap by developing a cognitive effort-aware feedback model that explicitly quantifies the trade-off between human decision-making accuracy and mental effort. By integrating effort dynamics into inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), this model will enhance the robustness of AI systems in real-world, effort-intensive scenarios.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. To develop a cognitive effort-aware feedback model that quantifies the trade-off between human decision-making accuracy and mental effort.
2. To integrate effort dynamics into IRL to jointly infer human preferences and effort levels via hierarchical Bayesian inference.
3. To validate the model using behavioral datasets that capture human feedback under varying task complexities and constraints.
4. To identify systematic biases introduced by cognitive shortcuts in human feedback and develop strategies to mitigate these biases.

### Significance

This research is significant for several reasons:
1. **Enhanced Alignment**: By explicitly considering cognitive effort, the model will enable AI systems to better align with human preferences, particularly in effort-intensive scenarios.
2. **Improved Preference Inference**: The model will improve the accuracy of preference inference under real-world conditions, leading to more reliable AI systems.
3. **Identification of Biases**: The research will identify systematic biases in human feedback, informing the development of strategies to mitigate these biases.
4. **Interdisciplinary Contributions**: By integrating concepts from cognitive science into machine learning, this research will contribute to the interdisciplinary understanding of human-AI alignment.

## Methodology

### Research Design

The research will follow a methodology that combines cognitive science concepts with machine learning techniques to develop a cognitive effort-aware feedback model. The methodology consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect behavioral datasets that capture human feedback under varying task complexities and constraints. These datasets will include information about task difficulty, time taken, and feedback provided by human subjects.
2. **Model Development**: Develop a cognitive effort-aware feedback model that quantifies the trade-off between human decision-making accuracy and mental effort. This model will be based on hierarchical Bayesian inference, integrating effort dynamics into IRL.
3. **Model Training**: Train the model using the collected datasets, optimizing the joint inference of human preferences and effort levels.
4. **Model Validation**: Validate the model using a separate set of datasets, assessing its performance in preference inference and bias identification.
5. **Bias Mitigation**: Develop strategies to mitigate biases identified in the validation phase, improving the robustness of the model.

### Algorithmic Steps

#### Step 1: Data Collection

Data will be collected through experiments where human subjects are asked to provide feedback on various tasks under different conditions. The experiments will involve:
- **Task Complexity**: Varying the difficulty of tasks to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Time Constraints**: Introducing time limits to simulate effortful conditions.
- **Feedback Collection**: Capturing human feedback and associated metadata (e.g., time taken, task difficulty).

#### Step 2: Model Development

The cognitive effort-aware feedback model will be developed using hierarchical Bayesian inference. The model will consist of two levels:
- **Level 1 (Effort Level)**: A Gaussian process that models the effort level of the human subject.
- **Level 2 (Preference Level)**: A Gaussian process that models the human preference given the effort level.

The joint inference will be performed using variational inference, optimizing the posterior distribution of preferences and effort levels.

#### Step 3: Model Training

The model will be trained using the collected datasets. The training process will involve:
- **Initialization**: Initializing the parameters of the Gaussian processes.
- **Optimization**: Optimizing the parameters using variational inference to minimize the free energy.
- **Convergence**: Ensuring convergence of the optimization process.

#### Step 4: Model Validation

The model will be validated using a separate set of datasets. The validation process will involve:
- **Performance Metrics**: Assessing the model's performance in preference inference using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Bias Identification**: Identifying systematic biases in the model's predictions.
- **Generalization**: Evaluating the model's ability to generalize across different domains and task complexities.

#### Step 5: Bias Mitigation

Strategies to mitigate biases will be developed based on the results of the validation phase. These strategies may include:
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhancing the dataset with additional examples to reduce bias.
- **Regularization**: Incorporating regularization techniques to penalize biased predictions.
- **Expert Feedback**: Incorporating expert feedback to correct biased predictions.

### Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct preference inferences.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Bias Index**: A metric to quantify the systematic biases in the model's predictions.
