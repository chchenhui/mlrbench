# Cognitive Effort-Aware Preference Learning for Robust Human-AI Alignment

## Introduction

Aligning artificial intelligence (AI) systems with human intentions and values has emerged as a critical challenge in the development of safe, ethical, and user-centric AI applications. Current approaches to human-AI alignment, such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Learning from Demonstrations (LfD), fundamentally rely on inferring human preferences from observed feedback or behavior. However, these methods operate under highly questionable assumptions about human decision-making processes, often presuming that humans act rationally, provide consistent feedback, and express their true preferences directly through their actions or choices.

A particularly significant yet under-addressed assumption in current human-AI alignment frameworks is that humans provide feedback with uniform cognitive effort across different contexts and tasks. In reality, human decision-making is subject to cognitive constraints that significantly impact the quality, consistency, and reliability of feedback. When confronted with complex choices or time constraints, humans employ various cognitive shortcuts, heuristics, and satisficing strategies that may produce feedback misaligned with their true underlying preferences. As described by Herbert Simon's bounded rationality theory, humans make decisions within the constraints of limited cognitive resources, information, and time (Simon, 1955). This bounded rationality introduces systematic biases in human feedback that current AI alignment methods fail to account for.

The consequences of ignoring cognitive effort in human feedback are particularly severe in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and autonomous systems, where misinterpreting human preferences due to effort-induced noise can lead to harmful outcomes. For example, a medical decision support system trained on physician feedback might misinterpret simplified heuristic judgments made under time pressure as reflecting true clinical preferences, potentially leading to suboptimal treatment recommendations. Similarly, educational AI systems might misconstrue student choices made hastily or under cognitive load as genuine learning preferences, thereby reinforcing ineffective pedagogical strategies.

This research proposes a novel cognitive effort-aware preference learning framework that explicitly models the relationship between cognitive effort and feedback quality in human-AI alignment. By integrating insights from cognitive science, behavioral economics, and machine learning, we aim to develop a preference inference system that can distinguish between true underlying preferences and artifacts of cognitive effort limitations. The framework introduces a hierarchical Bayesian approach that jointly infers both human preferences and cognitive effort levels from observed feedback, enabling more accurate preference modeling under varying cognitive constraints.

The research objectives of this proposal are threefold:
1. To develop a formal mathematical framework for modeling the impact of cognitive effort on human feedback quality and consistency
2. To design and implement a cognitive effort-aware inverse reinforcement learning algorithm that accurately infers true preferences from effort-constrained feedback
3. To empirically validate the framework through controlled human studies involving feedback provision under varying cognitive loads and task complexities

The significance of this research extends across multiple domains of AI alignment. By addressing the fundamental gap between idealized models of human feedback and the reality of bounded rationality, this work contributes to developing more robust, human-aligned AI systems capable of accurately interpreting human intentions even when feedback is imperfect or effort-constrained. The proposed framework has potential applications in recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, healthcare decision support, educational technology, and large language model alignment, where understanding the cognitive context of human feedback is crucial for safe and effective AI deployment.

## Methodology

Our research methodology consists of three interconnected components: (1) a theoretical cognitive effort-aware preference model, (2) a computational framework for cognitive effort-aware inverse reinforcement learning, and (3) experimental validation through human studies with controlled cognitive effort manipulation.

### Cognitive Effort-Aware Preference Model

We propose a theoretical framework that explicitly models the relationship between cognitive effort, task complexity, and feedback quality. The model formalizes the notion that human feedback represents a noisy, effort-constrained approximation of true preferences.

Let $\theta \in \Theta$ represent the true underlying preferences of a human, which are typically unobserved. In a standard preference learning setting, we observe human feedback $D = \{d_1, d_2, ..., d_n\}$ and aim to infer $\theta$. Traditional approaches assume that feedback follows a rational choice model:

$$P(d_i|\theta) \propto \exp(\beta \cdot U(d_i|\theta))$$

where $U(d_i|\theta)$ is the utility of choice $d_i$ given preferences $\theta$, and $\beta$ is a rationality parameter.

We extend this model by explicitly incorporating cognitive effort $e \in [0,1]$ as a mediating variable between true preferences and expressed feedback:

$$P(d_i|\theta, e, c) \propto \exp(\beta \cdot (e \cdot U(d_i|\theta) + (1-e) \cdot H(d_i|c)))$$

where:
- $e$ represents the cognitive effort expended (1 = full effort, 0 = minimum effort)
- $c$ represents the contextual complexity of the decision task
- $H(d_i|c)$ represents a heuristic utility function employed under low effort, which depends on task complexity but not on true preferences

This formulation captures the key insight that as cognitive effort decreases, human feedback becomes increasingly determined by effort-saving heuristics rather than true preference-maximizing behavior. The effort level $e$ itself is modeled as a function of task complexity $c$ and individual cognitive capacity $\kappa$:

$$e = f(c, \kappa) = \frac{\kappa}{c + \kappa}$$

This function captures the intuition that effort decreases with increasing task complexity and increases with greater cognitive capacity.

### Cognitive Effort-Aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning

Building on the theoretical model, we develop a computational framework for inferring true preferences from observed feedback while accounting for varying cognitive effort. We formulate this as a hierarchical Bayesian inference problem:

$$P(\theta, e|D, c) \propto P(D|\theta, e, c) \cdot P(e|c) \cdot P(\theta)$$

The inference process consists of the following steps:

1. **Complexity Estimation**: For each decision task instance, estimate its complexity $c$ based on objective features such as number of options, attribute dimensionality, time constraints, and information presentation.

2. **Joint Inference**: Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, jointly infer the posterior distribution over true preferences $\theta$ and effort levels $e$:

   a. **Effort Inference**: For each observation $d_i$ with complexity $c_i$, infer the posterior distribution of effort $P(e_i|d_i, \theta, c_i)$.
   
   b. **Preference Inference**: Using the inferred effort distribution, update the posterior over preferences $P(\theta|D, e, c)$.

3. **Heuristic Modeling**: Learn the structure of the heuristic function $H(d_i|c)$ from data by identifying systematic patterns in low-effort decisions.

In practical implementation, we employ a variational inference approach to approximate the posterior:

$$P(\theta, e|D, c) \approx Q_\phi(\theta, e)$$

where $Q_\phi$ is a parameterized variational distribution. The parameters $\phi$ are optimized to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence:

$$\phi^* = \arg\min_\phi \text{KL}(Q_\phi(\theta, e) || P(\theta, e|D, c))$$

This is equivalent to maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO):

$$\mathcal{L}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{Q_\phi(\theta, e)}[\log P(D|\theta, e, c)] - \text{KL}(Q_\phi(\theta, e) || P(\theta) \cdot P(e|c))$$

Our implementation uses a neural network architecture to parameterize both the effort inference model and the preference inference model, allowing for flexible representation of complex preference structures and effort dynamics.

### Experimental Validation

To validate our cognitive effort-aware preference learning framework, we design a series of controlled human studies with the following components:

#### Experiment 1: Preference Elicitation Under Varying Cognitive Load

**Participants**: 200 adult participants recruited through an online platform.

**Design**: Participants complete multiple preference elicitation tasks (e.g., ranking, pairwise comparisons, direct utility assessment) across different domains (e.g., consumer products, healthcare scenarios, ethical dilemmas) under systematically varied cognitive load conditions:

1. **Low Cognitive Load**: Simple choices with few options and attributes, no time constraint
2. **Medium Cognitive Load**: Moderate choice complexity, mild time pressure
3. **High Cognitive Load**: Complex choices with many options and attributes, significant time pressure

**Cognitive Load Manipulation**: We manipulate cognitive load through:
- Time constraints (e.g., 5s vs. 30s per decision)
- Concurrent task demands (e.g., digit memorization while making choices)
- Information complexity (e.g., varying the number of attributes per option)

**Measurements**:
- Choice data (selections, rankings, ratings)
- Response times
- Self-reported cognitive effort (validated scales)
- Physiological measures where feasible (e.g., pupil dilation, heart rate variability)

#### Experiment 2: Ground Truth Preference Recovery

**Design**: A subset of participants from Experiment 1 (n=50) complete an extended preference elicitation protocol designed to establish "ground truth" preferences through multiple elicitation methods under ideal, low-pressure conditions. We then compare these ground truth preferences with those inferred from their behavior under varying cognitive load in Experiment 1.

**Analysis**: We evaluate how accurately our cognitive effort-aware model recovers ground truth preferences compared to standard preference inference models that ignore cognitive effort.

#### Experiment 3: Decision Support with Effort-Aware Preference Models

**Design**: Participants interact with both standard and cognitive effort-aware recommendation systems trained on their previous choices. We evaluate user satisfaction, perceived accuracy, and decision quality across systems.

**Metrics**:
- Recommendation acceptance rate
- Decision confidence
- Perceived recommendation quality
- Decision regret (measured in follow-up)

### Data Analysis and Model Evaluation

We evaluate our cognitive effort-aware preference learning framework using several metrics:

1. **Preference Inference Accuracy**: Measured by the correlation between inferred preferences and ground truth preferences established in Experiment 2.

2. **Predictive Accuracy**: The model's ability to predict future choices (out-of-sample prediction), measured using log-likelihood and accuracy metrics.

3. **Effort Inference Accuracy**: Correlation between model-inferred effort levels and measured cognitive effort indicators (response time, self-reports, physiological measures).

4. **Comparative Performance**: Improvement over baseline models that ignore cognitive effort:
   - Standard inverse reinforcement learning
   - Maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning
   - Bayesian preference inference without effort modeling

5. **Computational Efficiency**: Runtime and scalability analysis for practical applications.

For statistical analysis, we employ hierarchical Bayesian modeling to account for individual differences and mixed-effects models to analyze the impact of cognitive load manipulations on inference accuracy.
