Title  
NeuroScale: Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Operators for Universal Multiscale Modeling  

Introduction  
Background  
Modeling complex physical, chemical, and biological systems often requires resolving phenomena across orders of magnitude in space and time. The governing equations—from quantum mechanics to continuum fluid dynamics—are well established, yet direct numerical simulation at full fidelity is computationally intractable for systems of practical interest, such as turbulent flows, climate processes, or materials under extreme conditions. Existing multiscale approaches (renormalization, density functional theory, coarse-grained molecular dynamics) tend to be handcrafted for specific problems and lack generalizability. Recent advances in operator learning, physics-informed neural networks, and surrogate modeling demonstrate promise, but they often struggle to adaptively bridge scales while enforcing conservation laws and quantifying uncertainty.  

Research Objectives  
1. Develop a unified framework, NeuroScale, that learns scale-bridging neural operators from high-fidelity simulation data and experimental observations.  
2. Introduce scale-adaptive attention mechanisms to automatically identify relevant multiresolution features.  
3. Enforce physical constraints—conservation laws, symmetries, and invariants—through physics-informed regularization.  
4. Quantify and propagate uncertainty during coarse-graining to ensure reliability in downstream predictions.  
5. Validate NeuroScale on benchmark multiscale problems drawn from materials science, fluid dynamics, and climate modeling, and compare performance against state-of-the-art neural operator methods.  

Significance  
By framing multiscale modeling as a learnable mapping between function spaces, NeuroScale aims to provide a domain-agnostic, scalable solution that preserves critical physics and delivers computational speedups of one to three orders of magnitude. Such capabilities could accelerate discovery in high-temperature superconductivity, fusion energy, weather forecasting, and the design of digital twins for complex living systems.  

Methodology  
Overview  
NeuroScale comprises three core components: (1) a scale-adaptive attention neural operator, (2) physics-informed regularization enforcing multiscale consistency, and (3) an uncertainty-aware coarse-graining module. The training pipeline proceeds by ingesting fine-resolution simulation or experimental data, learning the operator mapping from fine to coarse representations, and validating predictions on withheld test problems.  

Data Collection and Preprocessing  
• High-fidelity simulation datasets will be generated or obtained for three prototypical multiscale systems:  
  – Subsurface porous flow governed by Darcy’s law coupled to Navier–Stokes at pore scale.  
  – Two-dimensional turbulent flow in a periodic box (Reynolds number range 1e3–1e5).  
  – Idealized atmospheric convection patterns subject to Boussinesq approximation for climate analogs.  
• Each dataset comprises pairs (u_fine(x,t), u_coarse(x,t)), where u_fine solves the detailed PDE system at resolution Δx_fine and u_coarse at Δx_coarse = k⋅Δx_fine, with k ∈ {4,8,16}.  
• Data augmentation includes random rotations, domain reflections, and time-shift perturbations to enforce invariances and to enlarge training diversity.  

Model Architecture  
1. Scale-Adaptive Attention Neural Operator  
   • Represent input fine-scale field u_fine as a multi-scale feature hierarchy  
     $$\{U^{(ℓ)}(x)\}_{ℓ=0}^{L},\quad U^{(ℓ)}(x) = \text{Downsample}\bigl(u_{\text{fine}}(x)\bigr)\text{ at scale }2^{ℓ}.$$  
   • At each scale ℓ, compute query, key, and value feature maps:  
     $$Q^{(ℓ)} = W_Q^{(ℓ)} * U^{(ℓ)},\quad K^{(ℓ)} = W_K^{(ℓ)} * U^{(ℓ)},\quad V^{(ℓ)} = W_V^{(ℓ)} * U^{(ℓ)},$$  
     where * denotes convolution or integral operator.  
   • Cross-scale attention weights α^{(ℓ,ℓ′)} are computed by  
     $$\alpha^{(ℓ,ℓ′)}(x,y)=\frac{\exp\bigl(\langle Q^{(ℓ)}(x),K^{(ℓ′)}(y)\rangle/\sqrt{d}\bigr)}{\sum_{m,n}\exp\bigl(\langle Q^{(m)}(x),K^{(n)}(y)\rangle/\sqrt{d}\bigr)}.$$  
   • Aggregate values across scales to form multi-resolution representation:  
     $$\widetilde{U}(x)=\sum_{ℓ,ℓ′}\int \alpha^{(ℓ,ℓ′)}(x,y)\,V^{(ℓ′)}(y)\,dy.$$  
   • Final output u_pred is obtained by a synthesis operator S mapping $\widetilde{U}$ to the coarse grid:  
     $$u_{\text{pred}} = S\bigl(\widetilde{U}\bigr).$$  
2. Physics-Informed Regularization  
   • For each training example, enforce approximate satisfaction of governing PDE residuals at both scales. Given a PDE operator $\mathcal{N}$ (e.g., $\partial_t + \nabla\cdot f(\cdot)$), define residual:  
     $$R_{\text{fine}}(x,t) = \mathcal{N}\bigl(u_{\text{pred}}^{\text{up}}\bigr)\bigl(x,t\bigr),\quad R_{\text{coarse}}(x,t)=\mathcal{N}\bigl(u_{\text{pred}}\bigr)(x,t),$$  
     where $u_{\text{pred}}^{\text{up}}$ is the upsampled coarse prediction mapped back to fine resolution.  
   • Conservation constraints (mass, momentum, energy) are enforced by penalizing the divergence error:  
     $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{phys}} = \lambda_1\|R_{\text{fine}}\|_{2}^{2} + \lambda_2\|R_{\text{coarse}}\|_{2}^{2} + \lambda_3\|\nabla\cdot u_{\text{pred}}\|_{2}^{2}.$$  
   • Symmetry and invariance are enforced via data augmentation consistency and equivariant layers if necessary.  

3. Uncertainty-Aware Coarse-Graining  
   • Model aleatoric uncertainty via a heteroscedastic Gaussian output:  
     $$p\bigl(u_{\text{true}}\mid u_{\text{pred}}\bigr)=\mathcal{N}\bigl(u_{\text{pred}},\sigma^2(x)\bigr),$$  
     with predicted variance $\sigma^2(x)$ obtained through a parallel network head. The negative log-likelihood loss:  
     $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{NLL}}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{x,t}\Bigl[\frac{\|u_{\text{true}}-u_{\text{pred}}\|^2}{\sigma^2}+\log\sigma^2\Bigr].$$  
   • Capture epistemic uncertainty with deep ensembles or Monte Carlo dropout across M models to compute prediction and variance.  

Training Objective  
The total loss for a batch of size N and time steps T is  
$$\mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{NT}\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{t=1}^T\bigl[\|u_{\text{pred}}-u_{\text{true}}\|_2^2 + \gamma\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{phys}} + \beta\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{NLL}}\bigr],$$  
where $\gamma,\beta$ are hyperparameters tuned by grid search or Bayesian optimization.  

Algorithmic Steps  
1. Precompute multiscale representations $\{U^{(ℓ)}\}$ from $u_{\text{fine}}$.  
2. Forward pass through scale-adaptive attention layers to obtain $u_{\text{pred}}$.  
3. Compute physics residuals $R_{\text{fine}},R_{\text{coarse}}$ via automatic differentiation of $\mathcal{N}$.  
4. Predict variance $\sigma^2$ for each point.  
5. Evaluate $\mathcal{L}$ and perform backpropagation to update all weights.  
6. Periodically evaluate on held-out test problems and adjust $\gamma,\beta$.
