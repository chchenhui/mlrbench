# NeuroScale: Adaptive Neural Operators for Multiscale Physics Bridging

## 1. Introduction

The grand challenge of contemporary computational science lies in bridging the vast gap between fundamental physical theories and practical simulations of complex systems. As Dirac noted in 1929, while the underlying equations governing physical systems are largely known, their computational complexity renders exact solutions intractable for all but the simplest cases. Even modest systems containing approximately 100 atoms exceed the capabilities of modern supercomputers when modeled from first principles.

This computational barrier has profound implications across scientific domains. High-impact problems such as understanding high-temperature superconductivity, developing viable fusion power, improving weather prediction accuracy, creating digital twins of living organisms, and designing efficient catalysts remain partially inaccessible due to our inability to effectively transition between scales while preserving essential physics.

Traditional approaches to multiscale modeling have typically been domain-specific, requiring carefully crafted approximations and simplifications tailored to particular systems. While successful in their respective domains, these approaches lack generalizability, hampering scientific progress across disciplines. The emergence of machine learning, particularly neural operators capable of learning mappings between function spaces, offers new possibilities for developing more universal multiscale modeling frameworks.

### Research Objectives

This research proposal introduces NeuroScale, a novel framework for learning scale-bridging neural operators that adaptively identify and preserve essential physics across scales. The project aims to:

1. Develop scale-adaptive attention mechanisms that automatically identify relevant features at different resolutions
2. Implement physics-informed regularization techniques that enforce conservation laws and symmetries across scales
3. Design uncertainty-aware coarse-graining methods that quantify information loss during scale transitions
4. Validate the framework on benchmark problems spanning multiple scientific domains
5. Demonstrate computational efficiency gains while maintaining physical accuracy

### Significance

The successful development of NeuroScale would represent a significant advancement in computational science by providing a generalizable approach to multiscale modeling. Unlike traditional domain-specific methods, this framework could be applied across disciplines, enabling researchers to tackle previously intractable problems. The potential impact includes:

1. Accelerating scientific discovery by enabling efficient simulation of complex systems
2. Providing insights into emergent phenomena that arise from interactions across scales
3. Reducing the computational resources required for high-fidelity simulations
4. Creating a foundation for digital twins of complex systems from materials to biological entities
5. Establishing a methodology for systematic scale transitions guided by physics principles

By focusing on the fundamental challenge of scale bridging, NeuroScale addresses the core limitation identified in the workshop description: enabling the development of universal AI methods for efficient and accurate approximations in complex scientific problems.

## 2. Methodology

The NeuroScale framework integrates three key innovations: scale-adaptive attention mechanisms, physics-informed regularization, and uncertainty-aware coarse-graining. These components work together to create a comprehensive approach to multiscale modeling that maintains physical accuracy while achieving computational efficiency. The methodology is designed to be adaptable across scientific domains while preserving domain-specific physical constraints.

### 2.1 Neural Operator Architecture

The foundation of NeuroScale is a neural operator framework that learns mappings between function spaces. Unlike traditional neural networks that map between finite-dimensional vector spaces, neural operators can approximate operators that map between infinite-dimensional function spaces, making them well-suited for modeling partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern many physical systems.

The core neural operator formulation builds on recent advances in operator learning. Given input and output function spaces $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$, we seek to learn an operator $\mathcal{G}: \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{V}$ that maps between these spaces. For a physical system, $\mathcal{U}$ might represent initial conditions, boundary conditions, or material properties, while $\mathcal{V}$ represents the solution field.

The neural operator architecture consists of:

$$\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{Q} \circ (\mathcal{K}_L \circ \sigma \circ \mathcal{K}_{L-1} \circ ... \circ \sigma \circ \mathcal{K}_1) \circ \mathcal{P}$$

where:
- $\mathcal{P}: \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{V}_0$ is a lifting operator that projects the input function to a higher-dimensional feature space
- $\mathcal{K}_l: \mathcal{V}_{l-1} \rightarrow \mathcal{V}_l$ are kernel integral operators that perform non-local operations
- $\sigma$ is a nonlinear activation function applied pointwise
- $\mathcal{Q}: \mathcal{V}_L \rightarrow \mathcal{V}$ is a projection operator that maps from the feature space to the output function space

Each kernel integral operator $\mathcal{K}_l$ is defined as:

$$(\mathcal{K}_l v)(x) = \int_{\Omega} \kappa_l(x, y) v(y) dy + W_l v(x)$$

where $\kappa_l$ is a learnable kernel function, $\Omega$ is the domain, and $W_l$ is a local linear transformation.

### 2.2 Scale-Adaptive Attention Mechanism

To identify relevant features across different scales, we introduce a scale-adaptive attention mechanism that dynamically focuses on important scales and spatial regions. This mechanism is inspired by transformer architectures but adapted to the multiscale context.

The scale-adaptive attention operates across both spatial and scale dimensions:

$$\textrm{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \textrm{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

where $Q$, $K$, and $V$ are query, key, and value matrices derived from the input features. To incorporate scale information, we modify the attention mechanism to include scale-dependent embeddings:

$$Q_s = W_Q^s f_s, \quad K_s = W_K^s f_s, \quad V_s = W_V^s f_s$$

where $f_s$ represents features at scale $s$, and $W_Q^s$, $W_K^s$, and $W_V^s$ are scale-specific projection matrices.

The cross-scale attention is computed as:

$$\textrm{CrossScaleAttention}(s_i, s_j) = \textrm{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_{s_i}K_{s_j}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V_{s_j}$$

This allows information to flow between different scales, enabling the model to capture multiscale interactions. The total scale-adaptive attention output is:

$$\textrm{ScaleAdaptiveAttention}(f) = \sum_{s_i} w_{s_i} \sum_{s_j} \textrm{CrossScaleAttention}(s_i, s_j)$$

where $w_{s_i}$ are learnable scale weights that determine the importance of each scale in the final output.

### 2.3 Physics-Informed Regularization

To ensure that the learned operators respect physical laws across scales, we implement physics-informed regularization that enforces conservation principles and symmetries. The regularization consists of two components:

1. **PDE Constraints**: For systems governed by known differential equations, we incorporate these equations as soft constraints in the loss function:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{PDE}} = \lambda_{\textrm{PDE}} \left\| \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{G}(u)) \right\|^2$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ is the differential operator representing the physical law, and $\lambda_{\textrm{PDE}}$ is a weighting parameter.

2. **Conservation Laws**: For quantities that should be conserved across scales (e.g., mass, energy, momentum), we add conservation constraints:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{cons}} = \lambda_{\textrm{cons}} \sum_i \left| \int_{\Omega} \phi_i(\mathcal{G}(u)) dx - \int_{\Omega} \phi_i(u) dx \right|$$

where $\phi_i$ represents a conserved quantity, and $\lambda_{\textrm{cons}}$ is a weighting parameter.

3. **Symmetry Preservation**: For systems with known symmetries, we enforce equivariance properties:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{sym}} = \lambda_{\textrm{sym}} \left\| \mathcal{G}(T(u)) - T'(\mathcal{G}(u)) \right\|^2$$

where $T$ and $T'$ are transformations representing symmetries at different scales, and $\lambda_{\textrm{sym}}$ is a weighting parameter.

The total physics-informed regularization term is:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{physics}} = \mathcal{L}_{\textrm{PDE}} + \mathcal{L}_{\textrm{cons}} + \mathcal{L}_{\textrm{sym}}$$

### 2.4 Uncertainty-Aware Coarse-Graining

A critical aspect of multiscale modeling is quantifying information loss during scale transitions. We develop an uncertainty-aware coarse-graining approach that estimates the uncertainty introduced by scale transitions and propagates it through the model.

The coarse-graining operation is defined as:

$$u_{\textrm{coarse}} = \mathcal{C}(u_{\textrm{fine}})$$

where $\mathcal{C}$ is a coarse-graining operator that maps from a fine scale to a coarser scale. To quantify uncertainty, we model the coarse-grained representation as a probabilistic distribution:

$$p(u_{\textrm{coarse}} | u_{\textrm{fine}}) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_{\mathcal{C}}(u_{\textrm{fine}}), \Sigma_{\mathcal{C}}(u_{\textrm{fine}}))$$

where $\mu_{\mathcal{C}}$ and $\Sigma_{\mathcal{C}}$ are learned mean and covariance functions. This allows us to quantify the information loss during coarse-graining and propagate uncertainty through the model.

The reverse operation, fine-graining, is similarly modeled:

$$p(u_{\textrm{fine}} | u_{\textrm{coarse}}) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_{\mathcal{F}}(u_{\textrm{coarse}}), \Sigma_{\mathcal{F}}(u_{\textrm{coarse}}))$$

This probabilistic formulation enables us to sample multiple fine-scale realizations consistent with a given coarse-scale state, capturing the inherent uncertainty in scale transitions.

### 2.5 Training Procedure

The overall training procedure combines supervised learning from multiscale simulation data with physics-informed regularization. The loss function includes:

1. **Prediction Loss**: Measures the discrepancy between the predicted and ground truth outputs at various scales:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{pred}} = \sum_s w_s \left\| \mathcal{G}_s(u) - v_s \right\|^2$$

where $\mathcal{G}_s$ is the operator at scale $s$, $v_s$ is the ground truth at that scale, and $w_s$ are scale-dependent weights.

2. **Physics Loss**: The physics-informed regularization term described earlier:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{physics}} = \mathcal{L}_{\textrm{PDE}} + \mathcal{L}_{\textrm{cons}} + \mathcal{L}_{\textrm{sym}}$$

3. **Uncertainty Loss**: A term based on negative log-likelihood to calibrate uncertainty estimates:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{uncert}} = -\log p(v | u)$$

The total loss function is:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\textrm{pred}} + \lambda_{\textrm{physics}} \mathcal{L}_{\textrm{physics}} + \lambda_{\textrm{uncert}} \mathcal{L}_{\textrm{uncert}}$$

where $\lambda_{\textrm{physics}}$ and $\lambda_{\textrm{uncert}}$ are hyperparameters controlling the relative importance of each term.

### 2.6 Experimental Design and Validation

To validate the NeuroScale framework, we will conduct experiments on benchmark problems spanning multiple scientific domains:

1. **Fluid Dynamics**: Modeling turbulent flows with a focus on capturing both small-scale eddies and large-scale flow patterns. We will use the Navier-Stokes equations at different Reynolds numbers and validate against direct numerical simulation (DNS) data.

4. **Quantum Chemistry**: Modeling molecular dynamics by bridging quantum and classical descriptions. We will validate against ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and experimental reaction rates.

For each domain, we will assess the following metrics:

1. **Prediction Accuracy**: Mean squared error (MSE) and relative L2 error compared to high-fidelity simulations or experimental data.

2. **Physical Consistency**: Measurement of conservation law violations and symmetry preservation across scales.

3. **Computational Efficiency**: Speedup ratio compared to traditional multiscale modeling approaches and direct high-fidelity simulations.

4. **Uncertainty Calibration**: Reliability diagrams and calibration metrics to assess the quality of uncertainty estimates.

5. **Generalization**: Performance on out-of-distribution examples to test the robustness of the learned operators.
