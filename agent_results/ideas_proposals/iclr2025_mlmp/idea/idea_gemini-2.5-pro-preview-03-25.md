**Title:** Learning Effective Hamiltonians in Latent Space using Neural Operators

**Motivation:** Simulating complex physical systems across scales is hindered by the computational cost of resolving micro-level dynamics. While coarse-graining methods exist, they often struggle to preserve fundamental physical structures like energy conservation or symmetries inherent in the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics.

**Main Idea:** We propose a novel approach combining autoencoders, neural operators, and Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs). An autoencoder first maps high-dimensional micro-state data (e.g., particle positions/momenta) onto a low-dimensional latent manifold. Concurrently, a neural operator (e.g., FNO, DeepONet) learns the evolution operator directly within this latent space. Crucially, the learned operator incorporates an HNN structure, ensuring the latent dynamics implicitly follow an *effective* Hamiltonian, thus preserving physical consistency. Training minimizes reconstruction loss and prediction error in the latent space, using data from expensive micro-scale simulations. This yields a fast, physically-constrained surrogate model for simulating emergent macro-scale behavior from micro-level rules.
