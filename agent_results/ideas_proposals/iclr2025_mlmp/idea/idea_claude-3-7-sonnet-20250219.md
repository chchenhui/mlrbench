# NeuroScale: Adaptive Neural Operators for Multiscale Modeling

## Motivation
Modeling complex systems like climate or chemical reactions requires bridging vast spatial and temporal scales. Traditional approaches either oversimplify complex phenomena or require prohibitive computational resources. The fundamental barrier is the inability to systematically transition between scales while preserving critical physics. Multiscale modeling remains largely problem-specific rather than generalizable, limiting scientific progress in high-impact areas like superconductivity, fusion energy, and weather prediction.

## Main Idea
NeuroScale introduces a framework for learning scale-bridging neural operators that adaptively identify and preserve essential physics across scales. The approach combines three key innovations: (1) Scale-adaptive attention mechanisms that automatically identify relevant features at different resolutions; (2) Physics-informed regularization that enforces conservation laws and symmetries across scales; and (3) Uncertainty-aware coarse-graining that quantifies information loss during scale transitions. The framework learns directly from high-fidelity but expensive simulations to create computationally efficient surrogate models that maintain accuracy at larger scales. By framing multiscale modeling as a machine learning problem with physical constraints, NeuroScale could enable generalizable scale transitions applicable across disciplines, potentially transforming computational approaches to previously intractable problems in materials science, fusion research, and climate modeling.
