### Title: **Multiscale Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Complex System Modeling**

### Motivation:
The ability to model complex systems on a useful time scale is crucial for addressing pressing scientific challenges such as high-temperature superconductivity and climate prediction. Current computational methods are often impractical due to the immense scale and complexity of these systems. By developing a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach, we can bridge the gap between low-level theoretical models and high-level system dynamics, enabling more efficient and accurate simulations.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research will focus on developing a multiscale physics-informed neural network that can effectively integrate low-level quantum mechanics and high-level system dynamics. The methodology involves:

1. **Data Preparation**: Collecting and preprocessing experimental and simulation data across multiple scales.
2. **Model Architecture**: Designing a neural network architecture that incorporates both low-level physics equations and high-level system dynamics. This will include embedding physical laws as constraints within the neural network.
3. **Training**: Utilizing physics-informed loss functions that penalize deviations from known physical laws. The network will be trained using a combination of gradient-based optimization and experimental data.
4. **Validation**: Testing the model on various benchmarks and datasets to ensure its accuracy and efficiency in modeling complex systems.

Expected outcomes include a novel PINN framework that can handle multiscale physics, improved computational efficiency, and more accurate predictions for high-impact scientific problems. The impact of this research will be significant in enabling in silico solutions for complex systems, thereby advancing scientific discovery and technological innovation.
