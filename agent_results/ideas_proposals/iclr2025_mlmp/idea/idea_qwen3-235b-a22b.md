**Title:** Adaptive Hybrid AI for Multiscale Modeling via Reinforcement Learning and Symbolic Reasoning  

**Motivation:**  
Modeling complex systems across scales (e.g., quantum to macroscopic) remains a grand challenge due to computational intractability of low-level theories like quantum mechanics. Existing methods (e.g., DFT, MD) are accurate but computationally prohibitive for large systems. Developing universal AI-driven frameworks to automate scale transitions could unlock breakthroughs in materials science, climate modeling, and biophysics, where computational bottlenecks hinder progress.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a hybrid AI framework combining **reinforcement learning (RL)** and **symbolic regression** to dynamically select optimal approximations during simulations. The RL agent learns to switch between high-fidelity (e.g., quantum) and coarse-grained models (e.g., classical force fields) based on system states, minimizing computational cost while preserving accuracy. Symbolic regression ensures learned approximations respect physical laws (e.g., conservation laws), enhancing generalization. The framework is trained on diverse multiscale datasets (e.g., QM/MM simulations) and validated on high-impact tasks like protein folding and catalyst design. Expected outcomes include 10–100× speedups over conventional methods without sacrificing predictive accuracy. This approach addresses the workshop’s goal of universal AI-driven scale transitions, enabling *in silico* exploration of previously intractable systems, such as high-temperature superconductors or whole-cell simulations. Open-source implementation will foster cross-disciplinary adoption.  

**Impact:**  
Bridges AI, physics, and computational science by automating model selection while preserving interpretability. Enables real-time adaptive simulations for grand challenges in energy, health, and climate.
