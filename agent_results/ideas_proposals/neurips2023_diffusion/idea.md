1. **Title**: *Injective Neural ODE-based Conditional Diffusion Models for Scalable Inversion and Precise Image Editing*  

2. **Motivation**:  
Diffusion models struggle with exact inversion of corrupted observations (e.g., recovering original images from partial inputs like blurred regions), often requiring iterative, approximation-based optimization. This limits their use in critical applications like medical imaging or forensic reconstruction, where fidelity and determinism matter. Existing methods lack theoretical guarantees for exact inversion when using learned latent representations. Addressing this could unify generative modeling and inverse problem-solving while enabling precise, controllable edits to images through deterministic reconstruction pathways.  

3. **Main Idea**:  
We propose designing an invertible diffusion architecture via injective neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) that preserve information during the forward process. By structuring the diffusion chain as a deterministic, injective Neural ODE with a Lipschitz-regularized score network, we ensure exact inversion from corrupted observations without optimization heuristics. The model is trained on a conditional denoising objective, where the Neural ODE maps corrupted inputs to noise, and inversion involves reversing the ODE trajectory. For image editing, localized edits (e.g., inscribing text, recoloring objects) update hidden diffusion states in targeted latent regions, enabling geometrically coherent reconstructions. Expected outcomes include precise inversion of diverse corruption types (hollow gaps, noise masks) with theoretical guarantees of injectivity, and scalable applications to medical imaging and computer-aided design. This bridges the gap between variational inference and deterministic inversion in diffusion models.
