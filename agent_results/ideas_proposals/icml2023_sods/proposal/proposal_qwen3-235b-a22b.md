# Graph Neural Surrogate-Driven GFlowNets for Black-Box Discrete Sampling

## Introduction

### Background  
Sampling and optimization in discrete spaces are foundational challenges in machine learning, physics, and combinatorial optimization. Modern applications such as protein design, neural architecture search, and large language model (LLM) inference demand efficient exploration of high-dimensional discrete spaces with complex, long-range dependencies. However, black-box objectives—where gradient information is inaccessible and function evaluations are computationally expensive—pose significant barriers. Traditional methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and evolutionary algorithms often suffer from slow convergence and poor scalability in such settings. Recent advances in gradient-based discrete sampling (e.g., GFlowNets) and continuous-space embedding techniques have shown promise but struggle with black-box objectives that lack analytic gradients or exhibit high-order correlations.

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop **Graph Neural Surrogate-Driven GFlowNets (GNS-GFN)**, an iterative framework that combines:  
1. A **graph neural network (GNN) surrogate** to approximate the black-box objective and provide pseudo-gradients.  
2. A **GFlowNet sampler** to generate diverse, high-reward discrete configurations guided by the surrogate.  
3. **Active learning** to refine the surrogate using strategically selected proposals.  
4. **Reward calibration** to correct surrogate bias during training.  

The framework will minimize true-objective evaluations while capturing complex interactions in discrete spaces, enabling efficient sampling and optimization for applications like LLM posterior sampling and protein engineering.

### Significance  
By decoupling exploration from expensive function evaluations, GNS-GFN will address critical limitations of existing methods:  
- **Reduced computational cost**: Surrogate-driven gradients reduce reliance on true-objective queries.  
- **Modeling high-order correlations**: GNNs inherently capture dependencies in structured data (e.g., protein sequences, molecular graphs).  
- **Scalability**: The iterative design enables application to large-scale problems like device placement in distributed training or combinatorial optimization.  

This work will advance AI-driven scientific discovery in domains where discrete optimization bottlenecks hinder progress.

## Methodology

### Framework Overview  
The GNS-GFN framework iterates between four stages (Fig. 1):  
1. **Surrogate Initialization**: Train a GNN on a small seed dataset of discrete configurations and their true objective values.  
2. **GFlowNet Sampling**: Use the GNN surrogate to guide GFlowNet proposals via pseudo-gradients.  
3. **Active Learning**: Select high-uncertainty proposals for true-objective evaluation.  
4. **Surrogate & Reward Update**: Fine-tune the GNN and recalibrate GFlowNet rewards using new data.  

This cycle continues until convergence or budget exhaustion.

### Component Details  

#### 1. GNN Surrogate Model  
**Architecture**: A message-passing GNN $f_\theta: \mathcal{G} \to \mathbb{R}$ maps discrete configurations (represented as graphs) to scalar energy estimates. For a graph $G = (V, E)$ with node features $x_i$ and edge features $e_{ij}$:  
$$
h_i^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left( \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \text{MLP}\left(h_i^{(l)}, h_j^{(l)}, e_{ij}\right) \right)
$$
Final node embeddings are pooled into a graph-level representation $h_G$, and the surrogate energy is $f_\theta(G) = \text{MLP}_{\text{out}}(h_G)$.  

**Training Objective**: Minimize mean squared error (MSE) on true objective values $y$:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{surrogate}} = \mathbb{E}_{(G, y) \sim \mathcal{D}}\left[ (f_\theta(G) - y)^2 \right] + \lambda \|\theta\|_2^2
$$
where $\mathcal{D}$ is the dataset of evaluated configurations and $\lambda$ regularizes overfitting.

#### 2. GFlowNet Sampler  
GFlowNets model discrete configurations as trajectories $\tau = (s_0 \to s_1 \to \dots \to s_T)$ in a Markov decision process (MDP), where states $s_t$ represent partial configurations. The GFlowNet learns a forward policy $\pi_\phi(a|s)$ to sample high-reward configurations by satisfying the **flow matching condition**:  
$$
F(s) = \sum_{s' \in \text{Parents}(s)} F(s') \pi_\phi(s|s') + \mathbb{I}_{s = s_0}
$$
where $F(s)$ is the flow assigned to state $s$, and rewards $R(\tau) \propto \exp(f_\theta(G))$ are derived from the GNN surrogate.  

**Training**: Use the trajectory balance objective:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{GFlowNet}} = \left( \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \log \pi_\phi(a_t|s_t) + \log Z - f_\theta(G) \right)^2
$$
where $Z$ is a learnable partition function.

#### 3. Active Learning Strategy  
To prioritize informative proposals, we select samples with high surrogate uncertainty:  
- **Uncertainty Metric**: For a configuration $G$, compute the entropy of edge-wise GNN predictions or use Monte Carlo dropout.  
- **Selection**: Rank proposals by uncertainty and evaluate the top-$k$ samples on the true objective.  

This focuses exploration on regions where the surrogate is least confident, accelerating model improvement.

#### 4. Reward Calibration  
Surrogate bias is mitigated via importance weighting:  
$$
R_{\text{calibrated}}(G) = R(G) \cdot \frac{p_{\text{true}}(G)}{p_{\theta}(G)} \approx R(G) \cdot \exp\left( -\beta (f_\theta(G) - y) \right)
$$
where $\beta$ controls the temperature of the correction. Calibration ensures the GFlowNet converges to the true posterior despite surrogate inaccuracies.

### Experimental Design  

#### Datasets & Tasks  
1. **Synthetic**: NK-landscapes with tunable ruggedness and long-range interactions.  
2. **Protein Design**: Optimize amino acid sequences for stability using a black-box energy function.  
3. **Combinatorial Optimization**: Max-Cut on large graphs (vs. baselines like Tabu Search).  

#### Baselines  
- **MCMC**: Parallel tempering with GNN-informed proposals.  
- **Standard GFlowNet**: No surrogate, direct reward optimization.  
- **Bayesian Optimization (BO)**: With graph kernels or GNN-based acquisition functions.  

#### Evaluation Metrics  
1. **Effective Sample Size (ESS)**: Diversity of generated samples.  
2. **Convergence Speed**: Iterations to reach 90% of optimal reward.  
3. **Regret**: $(R^* - R)/R^*$ where $R^*$ is the best-known reward.  
4. **Computational Cost**: True-objective evaluations required.  

#### Implementation Details  
- **GNN**: 4-layer GraphSAGE with ReLU activations.  
- **GFlowNet**: Transformer-based policy network with 8 attention heads.  
- **Training**: AdamW optimizer, batch size 256, early stopping on validation loss.
