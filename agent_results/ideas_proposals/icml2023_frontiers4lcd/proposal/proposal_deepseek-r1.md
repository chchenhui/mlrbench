# Optimal Transport-Driven Neural ODEs for Robust Control Policies  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Modern control systems face critical challenges in adapting to real-world complexities, including distribution shifts, stochastic disturbances, and model uncertainties. Traditional control methods often rely on rigid assumptions about system dynamics or environmental conditions, limiting their applicability in scenarios such as robotic manipulation under variable friction or autonomous systems operating in dynamic environments. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling continuous-time dynamics, enabling the learning of flexible state transition laws [10]. Concurrently, Optimal Transport (OT) provides a geometric framework to quantify discrepancies between probability distributions, naturally aligning with control objectives that aim to steer systems from initial to target states [8].  

Recent work has begun bridging these domains: Scagliotti et al. (2023) used Neural ODEs to approximate OT maps for normalizing flows, while Pooladian et al. (2024) formalized Neural OT with Lagrangian costs. However, integrating OT-driven objectives into Neural ODE-based control policies remains underexplored, particularly in addressing robustness challenges highlighted by Blanchet et al. (2023) in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO).  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal addresses the following objectives:  
1. **Framework Development**: Unify Neural ODEs and OT into a cohesive control paradigm where system dynamics are governed by learnable ODEs, and policies are optimized via OT metrics (e.g., Wasserstein distance).  
2. **Robustness Integration**: Incorporate Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) principles through adversarial training and ambiguity sets [5, 9] to ensure robustness against perturbations.  
3. **Theoretical and Empirical Validation**: Establish convergence guarantees and validate the framework on tasks requiring robustness to distribution shifts, such as robotic manipulation and supply-chain optimization.  

### Significance  
By fusing OT’s geometric insights with Neural ODEs’ expressivity, this work will:  
- **Advance Control Theory**: Provide a data-driven, theoretically grounded framework for handling non-stationary environments.  
- **Improve Robustness**: Enable controllers that adapt to uncertainties by minimizing distributional discrepancies.  
- **Unify Disciplines**: Strengthen connections between machine learning (e.g., diffusion models [7]) and control theory (e.g., Lyapunov stability [3]).

## 2. Methodology  

### Framework Overview  
The proposed framework consists of three core components:  
1. **Neural ODE Dynamics**: A parameterized vector field $f_\theta(h(t), t, u(t))$ governs system evolution:  
   $$
   \frac{dh(t)}{dt} = f_\theta(h(t), t, u(t)), \quad h(0) \sim p_0
   $$  
   where $h(t) \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the system state, $u(t)$ is the control input, and $\theta$ are learnable parameters.  

2. **OT-Driven Loss Function**: The objective minimizes the Wasserstein-2 distance $W_2$ between the terminal state distribution $p_T$ and a target distribution $p_{\text{target}}$, regularized by control effort:  
   $$
   \mathcal{L}(\theta) = W_2(p_T, p_{\text{target}}) + \lambda \int_0^T \|u(t)\|^2 dt
   $$  
   Here, $\lambda$ balances trajectory optimality and control cost.  

3. **Adversarial Robustness**: To handle model uncertainties, adversarial perturbations $\delta(t)$ are introduced during training, leading to a min-max optimization:  
   $$
   \min_\theta \max_{\delta \in \Delta} \mathbb{E}\left[W_2(p_T^{\delta}, p_{\text{target}}) + \lambda \int_0^T \|u(t)\|^2 dt \right]
   $$  
   where $\Delta$ represents an OT ambiguity set [5] constraining plausible perturbations.  

### Algorithmic Design  
**Step 1: Data Collection and Simulation**  
- **Robotic Manipulation**: Train in MuJoCo simulations with randomized friction coefficients and object masses.  
- **Supply-Chain Optimization**: Use historical demand datasets with injected stochastic disturbances.  

**Step 2: Neural ODE Training with OT Regularization**  
- Compute $W_2$ via the Sinkhorn algorithm [8], leveraging its differentiable approximation for gradient-based learning:  
  $$
  W_2(p_T, p_{\text{target}}) \approx \min_{\mathbf{P} \in \Pi(p_T, p_{\text{target}})} \langle \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{P} \rangle - \epsilon H(\mathbf{P}),
  $$  
  where $\mathbf{C}$ is the cost matrix and $H$ is entropy.  
- Backpropagate through the ODE solver using adjoint sensitivity methods [10].  

**Step 3: Adversarial Training for Robustness**  
- Perturb initial states and dynamics parameters within OT ambiguity sets [5] to simulate worst-case scenarios.  
- Solve the inner maximization via projected gradient ascent.  

**Step 4: Stability and Safety Constraints**  
Incorporate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) [3] as differentiable layers to enforce safety:  
$$
\text{If } B(h(t)) \geq 0, \quad \text{then } \frac{dB}{dt} \geq -\alpha B(h(t)),
$$  
where $B$ is a CBF and $\alpha > 0$ ensures forward invariance.  

### Experimental Design  
**Tasks**  
1. **Robotic Arm Manipulation**: Lift objects with variable mass/friction.  
2. **Supply-Chain Inventory Management**: Optimize stock levels under stochastic demands.  

**Baselines**  
- **Traditional Control**: Model Predictive Control (MPC), LQG.  
- **Learning-Based**: Vanilla Neural ODEs [10], Opt-ODENet [3].  
- **OT-Based**: OT-Flow [8], DRO [4].  

**Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Performance**: Wasserstein distance to target, cumulative control cost.  
- **Robustness**: Performance degradation under adversarial perturbations.  
- **Efficiency**: Training time, sample complexity.
