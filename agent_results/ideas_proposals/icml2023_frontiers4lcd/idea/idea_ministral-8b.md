### Title: "Enhancing Reinforcement Learning with Stochastic Optimal Control"

### Motivation
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in decision-making tasks, but its performance can be significantly improved by incorporating principles from stochastic optimal control. Traditional RL methods struggle with high-dimensional and stochastic environments, while stochastic optimal control offers a framework to handle uncertainty and optimize long-term rewards. By integrating these two fields, we can develop more robust and efficient RL algorithms, ultimately enhancing their practical applicability.

### Main Idea
This research aims to develop a novel RL framework that leverages stochastic optimal control to handle uncertainty and improve learning efficiency. The proposed methodology involves the following steps:
1. **Modeling Uncertainty**: Represent the environment as a stochastic dynamical system using stochastic differential equations (SDEs).
2. **Optimal Control Policy**: Formulate the RL problem as a stochastic optimal control problem, where the goal is to minimize the expected cumulative cost over time.
3. **Policy Learning**: Use a deep learning approach to approximate the optimal policy, combining neural networks with control theory techniques to handle the high-dimensional state-action space.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the proposed method through extensive simulations and comparisons with existing RL algorithms on various benchmarks.

The expected outcomes include an improved RL algorithm that can handle high-dimensional and stochastic environments more effectively. The potential impact is a significant advancement in the field of reinforcement learning, enabling more robust and efficient decision-making systems in real-world applications.
