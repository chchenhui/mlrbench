# Neural-Symbolic Theorem Generation with Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Mathematical Discovery

## 1. Introduction

Mathematics serves as the foundation for scientific inquiry, technological advancement, and human understanding of the world. The development of new mathematical theorems has historically been driven by human creativity and intuition, requiring years of specialized education and expertise. As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, there is growing interest in leveraging computational methods to assist in the discovery of novel mathematical knowledge.

Automated theorem generation represents a significant challenge at the intersection of artificial intelligence and mathematics. While recent advances in machine learning, particularly deep neural networks, have shown promise in learning mathematical patterns and structures, they still struggle with generating mathematically sound theorems that are both novel and formally valid. Current approaches typically fall short in one of two ways: either producing statements that lack formal correctness or generating trivial variations of known results without meaningful innovation.

The limitations of existing methods stem from several factors. Neural approaches excel at pattern recognition but often lack the logical rigor necessary for formal mathematics. Conversely, purely symbolic methods maintain logical consistency but frequently miss creative connections that might lead to novel discoveries. Additionally, the evaluation and verification of generated theorems remain challenging, as they require both formal verification and assessment of mathematical significance.

This research proposes a novel neural-symbolic framework enhanced by reinforcement learning to address these challenges. Our approach integrates the pattern recognition capabilities of neural networks with the formal rigor of symbolic reasoning, guided by reinforcement learning to optimize for both correctness and novelty. By leveraging recent advances in neural theorem proving, knowledge representation, and reinforcement learning techniques, we aim to create a system capable of generating mathematically sound theorems that contribute meaningfully to mathematical knowledge.

The primary objectives of this research are:

1. To develop a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture capable of generating syntactically and semantically valid mathematical theorems
2. To implement a reinforcement learning mechanism that guides the exploration of the theorem space toward both correctness and novelty
3. To create a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses generated theorems based on formal validity, originality, and potential utility
4. To demonstrate the system's capability to discover non-trivial mathematical relationships that complement human research efforts

The significance of this work extends beyond artificial intelligence research. Success in automated theorem generation could accelerate mathematical discovery, provide new insights into mathematical structures, and support human mathematicians in exploring complex domains. Furthermore, the techniques developed may find applications in related fields such as formal verification, software engineering, and scientific hypothesis generation.

## 2. Methodology

Our research methodology integrates neural networks, symbolic reasoning, and reinforcement learning in a comprehensive framework for theorem generation. The approach consists of four primary components: (1) a neural theorem generator, (2) a symbolic verification module, (3) a reinforcement learning framework, and (4) a knowledge graph for guiding theorem novelty and relevance.

### 2.1 Neural Theorem Generator

The foundation of our system is a transformer-based neural network trained on formal mathematics corpora. We will utilize datasets from formal proof assistants such as Lean, Coq, and Isabelle/HOL, which contain a wide range of mathematical theorems across various domains.

The neural generator can be formalized as follows:

$$P(t|\mathcal{C}) = \text{Transformer}(\mathcal{C})$$

where $t$ represents a candidate theorem and $\mathcal{C}$ represents the context, which includes relevant mathematical definitions, axioms, and previously established theorems. The model will be initially trained using a masked language modeling objective:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{MLM}} = -\mathbb{E}_{t \sim \mathcal{D}} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{M}} \log P(t_i|t_{\backslash \mathcal{M}})$$

where $\mathcal{D}$ is the training dataset of formal theorems, $\mathcal{M}$ is a set of masked tokens, and $t_{\backslash \mathcal{M}}$ represents the theorem with masked tokens.

To enhance the model's ability to generate coherent mathematical statements, we will implement a two-stage training process. First, the model will be pre-trained on a large corpus of mathematical text to learn the structure and patterns of mathematical language. Then, it will be fine-tuned specifically on formal theorems to learn the syntax and semantics of theorem statements.

### 2.2 Symbolic Verification Module

To ensure the logical validity of generated theorems, we will integrate an automated theorem prover (ATP) as a verification mechanism. The verification module will translate the neural-generated theorems into formal logic representations compatible with existing ATPs such as E, Vampire, or Z3.

The verification process can be represented as:

$$V(t) = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if ATP can prove } t \text{ given context } \mathcal{C} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

To address the computational complexity of theorem proving, we will implement a staged verification approach:

1. Syntax checking: Ensure the theorem follows the formal grammar of mathematical language
2. Type checking: Verify that mathematical objects are used correctly according to their types
3. Consistency checking: Confirm the theorem does not contradict established knowledge
4. Full verification: Attempt to construct a formal proof using automated theorem provers

For efficiency, we will terminate the verification process at the earliest stage of failure, providing specific feedback that can be used to refine the generation process.

### 2.3 Reinforcement Learning Framework

We formulate the theorem generation task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where:
- The state $s$ represents the current context $\mathcal{C}$ and partially generated theorem
- Actions $a$ correspond to token-level or subtree-level operations in the theorem construction
- The transition function $P(s'|s,a)$ represents the deterministic update of the state after taking action $a$
- The reward function $R(s,a,s')$ provides feedback on the quality of the generated theorem

The reward function is defined as a weighted combination of multiple factors:

$$R(s,a,s') = \lambda_1 R_{\text{validity}}(s') + \lambda_2 R_{\text{novelty}}(s') + \lambda_3 R_{\text{relevance}}(s')$$

where:
- $R_{\text{validity}}(s')$ is based on the outcome of the symbolic verification module
- $R_{\text{novelty}}(s')$ measures how different the theorem is from existing knowledge
- $R_{\text{relevance}}(s')$ assesses the theorem's connection to the target mathematical domain
- $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ are hyperparameters controlling the balance between these objectives

To address the sparse reward problem inherent in theorem generation, we will implement a curriculum learning approach and intermediate rewards based on partial verification steps. This approach is inspired by recent work in proof synthesis such as QEDCartographer, which has shown success in formal verification tasks.

The policy gradient method will be used to optimize the neural generator's parameters $\theta$:

$$\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t) \cdot G_t \right]$$

where $G_t = \sum_{k=t}^{T} \gamma^{k-t} R(s_k, a_k, s_{k+1})$ is the discounted return from time step $t$, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor.

### 2.4 Knowledge Graph for Guiding Theorem Generation

To enhance the relevance and novelty of generated theorems, we will construct a knowledge graph $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ representing mathematical concepts and their relationships. Each vertex $v \in \mathcal{V}$ represents a mathematical concept, definition, or theorem, while edges $e \in \mathcal{E}$ represent relationships such as "depends on," "generalizes," or "is related to."

The knowledge graph will be initialized using existing mathematical knowledge bases and will be dynamically updated as new theorems are generated and verified. This graph will serve multiple purposes:

1. Identifying unexplored or underexplored connections between mathematical concepts
2. Guiding the theorem generation process toward promising areas
3. Evaluating the novelty of generated theorems by measuring their structural and semantic distance from existing knowledge

We will implement a graph attention mechanism to incorporate knowledge graph information into the neural generator:

$$\alpha_{v,u} = \frac{\exp(\text{LeakyReLU}(W[h_v \| h_u]))}{\sum_{u' \in \mathcal{N}(v)} \exp(\text{LeakyReLU}(W[h_v \| h_{u'}]))}$$

$$h_v' = \sigma\left(\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} \alpha_{v,u} W h_u\right)$$

where $h_v$ represents the feature vector of vertex $v$, $\mathcal{N}(v)$ denotes the neighbors of $v$, and $W$ is a learnable weight matrix. This attention mechanism will allow the model to focus on relevant concepts when generating theorems.

### 2.5 Experimental Design and Evaluation

We will conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our theorem generation system across multiple mathematical domains, including abstract algebra, real analysis, and combinatorics.

#### 2.5.1 Datasets

We will use the following datasets for training and evaluation:
- Formal mathematics libraries: Lean's mathlib, Coq's Mathematical Components, and Isabelle/HOL's Archive of Formal Proofs
- Mathematical textbooks and research papers converted to formal representations
- Synthetic datasets of theorems generated by systematically applying inference rules to axioms

#### 2.5.2 Evaluation Metrics

We will evaluate generated theorems using the following metrics:

1. **Formal Validity Rate (FVR)**: The percentage of generated theorems that pass formal verification
   $$\text{FVR} = \frac{\text{Number of verified theorems}}{\text{Total number of generated theorems}}$$

2. **Novelty Score (NS)**: A measure of how different a theorem is from existing theorems in the knowledge base
   $$\text{NS}(t) = 1 - \max_{t' \in \mathcal{KB}} \text{Sim}(t, t')$$
   where $\text{Sim}(t, t')$ is a similarity function based on semantic and structural features

3. **Complexity Score (CS)**: An assessment of the theorem's depth and complexity
   $$\text{CS}(t) = f(\text{length}(t), \text{depth}(t), \text{concepts}(t))$$
   where $f$ is a function combining metrics of length, proof depth, and number of concepts

4. **Human Evaluation Score (HES)**: Expert mathematicians will rate a subset of generated theorems on a scale from 1 to 5 for correctness, novelty, and potential significance

5. **Theorem Usefulness Score (TUS)**: A measure of how useful a generated theorem is for proving other theorems
   $$\text{TUS}(t) = \frac{\text{Number of proofs using }t}{\text{Total number of proofs attempted with }t\text{ available}}$$

#### 2.5.3 Experimental Protocol

Our experimental protocol will consist of the following steps:

1. Train the neural theorem generator on the formal mathematics corpus
2. Implement the symbolic verification module and knowledge graph
3. Train the reinforcement learning framework to optimize theorem generation
4. Generate theorems across different mathematical domains
5. Evaluate generated theorems using the metrics defined above
6. Compare our approach against baseline methods:
   - Pure neural generation without symbolic verification
   - Rule-based theorem generation systems
   - Random exploration of the theorem space with verification

We will conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component to the system's performance:
- Neural generator without knowledge graph guidance
- Reinforcement learning without the novelty reward component
- System without the staged verification approach

To ensure reproducibility, all experiments will be repeated multiple times with different random seeds, and statistical significance tests will be applied to the results.
