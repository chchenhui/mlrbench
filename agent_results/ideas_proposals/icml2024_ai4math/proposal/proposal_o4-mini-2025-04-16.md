Title  
Neural-Symbolic Theorem Generation with Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Mathematical Discovery  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Mathematical theorem generation is a frontier in AI-driven mathematical reasoning that promises to accelerate hypothesis formation, guide proof exploration, and ultimately foster novel discoveries. Traditional automatic theorem provers focus on verifying or finding proofs for existing conjectures, while recent advances in deep learning have enabled neural models to propose statements resembling human conjectures. However, purely neural approaches often struggle with logical correctness, and symbolic methods alone lack scalability and creative generalization. A hybrid neural-symbolic framework augmented by reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to combine the pattern‐recognition power of deep networks with the rigorous certainty of symbolic logic.

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a neural-symbolic RL system, NSThGen, capable of generating mathematically novel and formally valid theorems in first-order and higher-order logics. Our specific objectives are:  
1. To design a transformer‐based neural policy that proposes theorem statements conditioned on a knowledge graph of existing definitions and theorems.  
2. To integrate symbolic constraints via a context‐free grammar and an automated theorem prover (ATP) feedback loop to enforce logical validity.  
3. To formulate a reinforcement learning reward that balances correctness, novelty, and complexity, and to train the system in a self‐supervised RL regime.  
4. To evaluate the system on large formal corpora (Lean, Coq, Mizar) against state‐of‐the‐art baselines, using both automated metrics and expert human assessment.

Significance  
NSThGen will address key challenges in AI for mathematics by ensuring generated theorems are not only syntactically well‐formed but also semantically valid and non‐trivial. Successful completion will:  
- Enhance human–AI collaboration by supplying researchers with high‐quality conjectures.  
- Provide insights into integrating symbolic reasoning and deep learning under RL.  
- Establish robust evaluation metrics for theorem novelty and utility.

2. Methodology  
Overview  
Our approach consists of four stages: (A) Data Collection and Preprocessing, (B) Neural Policy Pretraining, (C) Reinforcement Learning with Symbolic Validation, and (D) Experimental Evaluation.  

A. Data Collection and Preprocessing  
1. Corpora Acquisition  
   • Lean Mathlib (≈ 30k theorems/proofs)  
   • Coq Standard Library (≈ 12k entries)  
   • Mizar Library (≈ 15k entries)  
2. Knowledge Graph Construction  
   • Nodes: definitions, lemmas, theorems  
   • Edges: “uses,” “extends,” “implies,” extracted via proof‐dependency analysis  
   • Represent each concept via embedding $e_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$ using a graph neural network (GNN)  
3. Tokenization and Grammar  
   • Define a context‐free grammar $G=(V,\Sigma,R,S)$ for logical formulas  
   • Apply Byte‐Pair Encoding (BPE) on proof token streams, preserving logical symbols as atomic tokens  

B. Neural Policy Architecture  
1. Transformer Policy $\pi_\theta$  
   • Input: sequence of token embeddings and aggregated context embedding $c$ from GNN  
   • Transformer encoder–decoder with $L$ layers, hidden size $H$, attention heads $h$  
   • Output: probability distribution $\pi_\theta(a_t\mid s_t)$ over grammar‐constrained next tokens  
2. Context Embedding  
   • For a partial theorem $T_t$, retrieve adjacent nodes in the knowledge graph  
   • Compute  
     $$ c_t = \mathrm{GNN}\bigl(\{e_i | i\in\mathcal{N}(T_t)\}\bigr) $$
   • Inject $c_t$ into the transformer's cross‐attention at each decoding step  

C. Reinforcement Learning Formulation  
1. Markov Decision Process  
   • State $s_t$: partial token sequence plus context embedding $c_t$  
   • Action $a_t$: next token sampled under grammar rules  
   • Episode: sequence of tokens forming a candidate theorem $T$  
   • Terminal state when a special “END” token is generated or length exceeds $L_{\max}$  
2. Reward Design  
   We define a composite reward  
     $$ R(T) = \alpha\,r_{\mathrm{valid}}(T) + \beta\,r_{\mathrm{novel}}(T) + \gamma\,r_{\mathrm{comp}}(T) $$
   where  
   • $r_{\mathrm{valid}}(T)\in\{0,1\}$ from ATP verification (e.g., Lean or E-prover succeed)  
   • $r_{\mathrm{novel}}(T)=1 - \max_{T'\in\mathcal{D}}\mathrm{sim}(T,T')$, with similarity measured by embedding cosine  
   • $r_{\mathrm{comp}}(T)=\tfrac{\ell(T)}{\ell_{\max}}$ encourages non‐trivial complexity  
   Coefficients $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ tuned via grid search.  
3. Policy Optimization  
   • Use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with advantage estimation  
   • Objective:  
     $$ J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau\sim\pi_\theta}\left[\sum_{t=0}^T A_t\,\log\pi_\theta(a_t\mid s_t)\right] $$
   • Advantage $A_t = \sum_{t'=t}^T\gamma^{t'-t}R_{t'} - V_\phi(s_t)$ learned via critic network $V_\phi$  
4. Symbolic Refinement  
   After generation, apply a symbolic constraint solver to prune ill‐formed proofs. Any candidate failing CFG rules or proof‐dependency consistency is discarded before ATP reward.

D. Algorithmic Steps  
1. Pretraining (Supervised)  
   a. Train transformer $\pi_\theta$ on (theorem statement)$\to$(token sequence) with cross‐entropy loss  
2. Knowledge Graph Embedding  
   a. Train GNN on link prediction among theorems/definitions  
3. Reinforcement Learning  
   a. Initialize policy $\pi_\theta$, critic $V_\phi$ from pretraining  
   b. For each RL iteration:  
      i. Sample $N$ episodes: generate candidate theorems via grammar‐constrained decoding  
      ii. For each $T_i$, invoke ATP to obtain $r_{\mathrm{valid}}$, compute novelty and complexity rewards  
      iii. Compute advantages $A_t$, update $(\theta,\phi)$ via PPO  
      iv. Apply symbolic refinement to update grammar constraints if systematic violations occur  
4. Memory and Exploration  
   • Use prioritized experience replay buffer to reuse high‐reward trajectories  
   • Inject entropy bonus in PPO to maintain exploration  

E. Experimental Design  
1. Baselines  
   • Pure transformer generation (no RL, no ATP feedback)  
   • Neural‐symbolic generation (Green & White 2024)  
   • QEDCartographer (Sanchez‐Stern et al. 2024) adapted for generation  
2. Datasets and Splits  
   • Formal corpora split: 70% training theorems, 15% validation, 15% hold‐out  
   • Hold‐out theorems and their statements removed from knowledge graph to test novelty  
3. Evaluation Metrics  
   • Validity: percentage of $T$ with $r_{\mathrm{valid}}=1$  
   • Novelty: average $r_{\mathrm{novel}}$ over valid $T$  
   • Complexity: average $r_{\mathrm{comp}}$  
   • Diversity: distinctness ratio among generated theorems  
   • Human Evaluation: mathematicians rate 100 samples on a 5‐point scale for non‐triviality and potential utility  
4. Statistical Analysis  
   • Perform paired $t$-tests between NSThGen and each baseline on all automated metrics  
   • Report confidence intervals (95%) for human scores  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate NSThGen will outperform baselines across validity, novelty, and diversity. Specifically:  
1. Validity above 85%, matching or exceeding current theorem‐proving systems.  
2. Novelty scores substantially higher (≥20% improvement) due to knowledge‐graph‐guided exploration.  
3. Human evaluators will rate at least 60% of generated theorems as non‐trivial and potentially publishable conjectures.  

Impact on the Field  
• AI–Mathematics Collaboration: By supplying automatically generated but rigorously verified conjectures, NSThGen can become an “idea engine” for mathematicians, accelerating the cycle of conjecture–proof–refinement.  
• Methodological Advancement: Our integration of grammar constraints, ATP feedback, and RL will serve as a blueprint for other domains requiring structured sequence generation under strict validity constraints (e.g., program synthesis, formal verification).  
• Open Resources: We will release code, trained models, and evaluation scripts, as well as a leaderboard for theorem‐generation challenges.  
• Future Directions:  
   – Extending to proof‐skeleton generation, where partial proofs guide full proof search.  
   – Incorporating human‐in‐the‐loop feedback to refine reward functions.  
   – Adapting the framework to educational settings, generating practice problems with varying difficulty.

In summary, NSThGen promises to bridge the gap between raw neural creativity and symbolic rigor, bringing us closer to AI systems that can autonomously contribute to mathematical knowledge.
