# Neural Autoformalization with Feedback Loops

## Motivation
Autoformalization—translating natural language mathematics to formal representations—remains a critical challenge in AI. Current approaches often fail to maintain semantic precision across the translation, limiting their practical use in proof systems. This challenge arises because natural mathematical language contains ambiguities and contextual subtleties that formal systems cannot tolerate. Improving autoformalization would unlock significant benefits for automated theorem proving, formalized mathematics, and education by bridging the gap between human mathematical thinking and formal verification systems.

## Main Idea
I propose a neural autoformalization system built around explicit feedback loops. The approach employs a dual-model architecture: a translation model that converts natural language to formal mathematics, and a verification model that checks the semantic preservation and correctness of the formalization. When errors are detected, the verification model provides specific, structured feedback about the nature of the error (type mismatch, semantic drift, incomplete translation, etc.). This feedback is then used to guide refinement of the translation. The system would be trained using a novel dataset of natural-formal pairs augmented with common error corrections, allowing it to learn from human-like revision processes. By incorporating both human feedback and automated consistency checks, this approach could achieve higher precision than existing end-to-end models while providing interpretable explanations for its formalizations.
