**Title:** Neural-Symbolic Theorem Generation with Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Mathematical Discovery  

**Motivation:** Automated theorem generation remains a critical challenge in AI-driven mathematics, as neural models often struggle to synthesize logically valid and novel theorems. Current approaches lack robustness in ensuring correctness while fostering creativity, hindering human-AI collaboration in mathematical research. Developing methods to generate reliable, nontrivial theorems could accelerate hypothesis generation and bridge gaps between computational reasoning and theoretical advancements.  

**Main Idea:**  
This research proposes a hybrid neural-symbolic framework enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL) to generate formally valid theorems. A self-supervised neural architecture (e.g., transformer-based model) is trained on formal mathematics corpora (e.g., Lean, Coq) to learn syntactic-semantic patterns. The model generates theorem candidates, which are validated using an automated theorem prover (ATP) acting as a reward signal in RL. Symbolic logic constraints refine outputs, ensuring compositional consistency, while a knowledge graph of mathematical concepts steers novelty. To evaluate, we introduce metrics for logical validity, originality, and applicability, benchmarked against human expert assessments.  

**Outcome:** A system capable of producing high-quality, never-before-seen theorems, validated for correctness and utility. This work advances AIâ€™s role in collaborative mathematics by enabling scalable, automated hypothesis creation and offering novel insights into the interplay between machine creativity and formal rigor.
