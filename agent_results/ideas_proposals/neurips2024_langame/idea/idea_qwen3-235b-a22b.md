**Title:** Interactive Language Learning through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Frameworks  

**Motivation:** Current LLMs are trained via static supervised or preference-based objectives, limiting their planning, reasoning, and personalization capabilities. Human language acquisition thrives on dynamic interaction, as highlighted by Wittgensteinâ€™s "language games" and game theory experiments. Bridging this gap requires scalable interactive training paradigms that mimic the social, iterative nature of language evolution.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where LLMs engage in structured language games (e.g., negotiation, collaborative problem-solving) to develop grounded language understanding. Agents will learn through self-play loops, receiving rewards for successful communication and task completion. The framework will integrate: (1) **Dynamic role assignment** (e.g., speaker/listener, collaborator/adversary) to simulate diverse social contexts; (2) **Emergent communication protocols** via RL-driven adaptation to novel tasks; and (3) **Transfer to real-world tasks** by distilling game-acquired skills into single-agent LLMs. Methodology includes designing games with quantifiable objectives (e.g., referential success, strategic coordination) and leveraging RL algorithms like PPO to optimize agent policies. Expected outcomes include improved contextual reasoning, personalized interaction styles, and emergent compositional language structures. This work could redefine LLM training by grounding language in interactive, goal-driven social dynamics, advancing applications in embodied AI and adaptive dialogue systems.
