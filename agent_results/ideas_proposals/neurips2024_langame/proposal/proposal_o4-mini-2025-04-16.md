Title  
Planning via Persuasion: Adversarial Language Games for Enhancing Multi-Step Planning and Reasoning in Large Language Models  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at pattern recognition and one-shot generation, but their ability to plan coherently over multiple steps and to justify decisions remains limited. This shortcoming stems in part from static, offline training paradigms (e.g., supervised learning on text corpora or reward modeling via preference data) that do not engage LLMs in rich, goal-oriented interactions. Meanwhile, cognitive science and language-emergence research (Wittgenstein, 1953; Steels, 2012) emphasize that language and reasoning crystallize through social “games”—interactive loops where agents negotiate meaning, goals, and proofs. Recent simulation work (Son et al., 2025; Shi et al., 2024) and game-theoretic studies demonstrate that self-play and adversarial dialogue can accelerate the emergence of complex behaviors.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal explores a novel finetuning paradigm—an adversarial “Persuasion Game”—in which a Planner LLM must construct a multi-step plan to achieve a given goal and, through dialogue, persuade a Skeptic LLM of its correctness and feasibility. The core objectives are:  
•   To design an interactive Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) environment that frames planning as a turn-based adversarial dialogue game.  
•   To develop reward structures and training algorithms that incentivize the Planner to improve both logical coherence and persuasiveness.  
•   To empirically validate that adversarial self-play yields superior planning performance compared to static and cooperative RL baselines.  

Significance  
By embedding LLMs in adversarial language games, we aim to:  
•   Ground planning capabilities in social interaction rather than passive imitation.  
•   Enhance reasoning transparency via justifications demanded by a Skeptic.  
•   Provide a scalable, self-supervised framework for continuous interactive finetuning (“language gamification”) that complements existing RLHF and supervised methods.  

2. Methodology  

2.1 Task Formulation  
We define a finite‐horizon, turn‐based Markov game between two agents: a Planner $\pi_\theta$ and a Skeptic $\sigma_\phi$. At the start of each episode, a task specification $g$ (e.g., “plan a three-course dinner with dietary constraints”) is sampled from a distribution $\mathcal{G}$. The dialogue unfolds over $T$ rounds:  
•   At round $t$, the Planner issues action $a_t$—an incremental plan step or supporting argument—given state $s_t$ (the dialogue history plus task).  
•   The Skeptic responds with a query or challenge $q_t$, updating the state for the next Planner turn.  

2.2 Model Architecture  
Both Planner and Skeptic are initialized from a pretrained LLM (e.g., GPT-style transformer). We add lightweight policy heads: a linear projection to parameterize $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ for the Planner, and similarly $\sigma_\phi(q|s,a)$ for the Skeptic.  

2.3 Reinforcement Learning Objective  
Planner Objective: Maximize expected cumulative reward  
$$J(\theta)\;=\;\mathbb{E}_{g\sim\mathcal{G},\tau\sim\pi_\theta,\sigma_\phi}\Bigl[\sum_{t=1}^T r_t\Bigr]$$  
where $r_t$ is the per-turn reward. We adopt a policy-gradient algorithm (e.g., PPO) with gradient  
$$\nabla_\theta J(\theta)\;=\;\mathbb{E}\Bigl[\sum_{t=1}^T \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)\,A_t\Bigr]$$  
and advantage estimates $A_t$ computed via Generalized Advantage Estimation.  

Skeptic Objective: To maintain adversarial pressure, we explore two modes:  
1.   Fixed Skeptic: $\phi$ is pretrained on a corpus of incredulity or critical‐thinking prompts (Johnson & Brown, 2023).  
2.   Co-trained Skeptic: Optimize $\phi$ to maximize discrepancy between Planner’s plan quality $q(\tau)$ and acceptance. This encourages a dynamic curriculum of critiques.  

2.4 Reward Design  
The reward $r_t$ for the Planner blends:  
•   Persuasion Reward $r_t^{\mathrm{pers}}$: +1 if Skeptic accepts a plan step or justification, –1 for invalid or contradictory steps.  
•   Coherence Reward $r_t^{\mathrm{coh}}$: +$\alpha$ times a language-model scoring metric (e.g., next-token log-probability under a reference proof).  
•   Efficiency Penalty $r_t^{\mathrm{len}}$: –$\beta$ per turn to encourage conciseness.  
Total reward:  
$$r_t = r_t^{\mathrm{pers}} + \alpha\,r_t^{\mathrm{coh}} - \beta$$  
Hyperparameters $\alpha,\beta$ are tuned in preliminary experiments.  

2.5 Algorithmic Steps (Planner Training)  
Algorithm 1: Adversarial RL for Planner

   Sample $a_t \sim \pi_\theta(\cdot|s_t)$.  
   Sample $q_t \sim \sigma_\phi(\cdot\,|\,s_t,a_t)$.  
   Compute reward $r_t$ and update $s_{t+1} \leftarrow s_t\cup\{a_t,q_t\}$.

end for  

2.6 Experimental Design  

Datasets and Tasks  
•   Synthetic logic puzzles (e.g., Tower of Hanoi variants, scheduling tasks).  
•   Real-world planning: recipe generation with constraints, itinerary planning.  
•   Human‐annotated persuasion scripts from debate transcripts (for pretraining Skeptic).  

Baselines  
1.   Supervised fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought annotations.  
2.   RLHF: reward model trained on human preferences for plan quality.  
3.   Cooperative Self-Play: positive-only dialogue games without adversarial skeptic.  
4.   In-Context RL planning (DICP; Son et al., 2025).  

Evaluation Metrics  
•   Planning Success Rate: fraction of tasks where the final plan meets all constraints and is validated by an oracle.  
•   Skeptic Acceptance Rate: percentage of plan steps accepted without further queries.  
•   Logical Consistency Score: using an external verifier (e.g., automated theorem prover or constraint checker).  
•   Dialogue Efficiency: average number of turns to consensus.  
•   Human Evaluation: rating on persuasiveness, clarity, and technical soundness (via crowdsourcing).  

Ablation Studies  
•   Reward components ($\alpha$ vs. $\beta$).  
•   Fixed vs. co-trained Skeptic.  
•   Varying horizon $T$ and task difficulty.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

Anticipated Findings  
•   Adversarial Persuasion yields higher planning success rates (≥10–20% improvement) and more robust justifications compared to static RLHF and cooperative self-play.  
•   Co-training the Skeptic produces a dynamic curriculum that accelerates Planner learning on hard tasks.  
•   The Planner develops concise, logically coherent argument chains, reducing dialogue length by 15–30%.  

Broader Impact  
This research will:  
•   Advance interactive finetuning (“language gamification”) as a third paradigm alongside supervised learning and RLHF.  
•   Provide insights into how adversarial dialogue shapes reasoning skills, bridging cognitive science theories of language games with large-scale neural models.  
•   Enable more reliable LLM deployments in domains requiring multi-step planning, such as robotics, automated tutoring, and strategic decision support.  

Risks and Mitigations  
•   Overfitting to adversarial tricks—mitigated via curriculum diversity and human‐in‐the-loop audits.  
•   Computational cost—addressed by transfer learning from preliminary lightweight environments before scaling to full-sized LLMs.  

Conclusion  
By embedding LLMs in an adversarial “Persuasion Game,” we anticipate a leap forward in automatic planning, justification, and interactive reasoning. This project lays the groundwork for a general, scalable language-gamification framework that can be extended to multi-agent cooperation, embodiment scenarios, and real-world decision‐making systems.
