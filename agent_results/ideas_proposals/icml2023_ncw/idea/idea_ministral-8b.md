### Title: "Dynamic Compression for Adaptive Neural Networks"

### Motivation:
As neural networks grow increasingly complex, the efficiency of training and inference becomes a critical bottleneck. Existing compression techniques often lack adaptability, leading to suboptimal performance in dynamic environments. This research aims to address these challenges by developing a dynamic compression strategy that adapts to the changing data distribution and model complexity.

### Main Idea:
The proposed research idea focuses on developing a dynamic compression framework for neural networks that can adaptively adjust its compression level based on the current data and model requirements. The methodology involves training a meta-controller that learns to balance compression and decompression rates in real-time. This controller uses reinforcement learning to optimize for both accuracy and computational efficiency. The expected outcomes include a more efficient training process, reduced inference latency, and improved generalization on new data. The potential impact of this research is significant, as it promises to enhance the scalability and efficiency of neural networks, making them more practical for real-world applications.
