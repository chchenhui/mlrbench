### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Modern neural compression methods leverage deep generative models to achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion (RD) performance. However, traditional approaches rely on discrete quantization, which introduces non-differentiability, complicates theoretical analysis, and limits optimization flexibility. Recent advances in normalizing flows (NFs) and information-theoretic principles, such as the Information Bottleneck (IB), offer promising alternatives. NFs enable invertible mappings between complex data distributions and tractable latent spaces, while the IB framework provides a principled way to balance compression and reconstruction fidelity. Despite progress, key challenges persist: (1) reconciling computational efficiency with theoretical guarantees, (2) eliminating quantization-induced performance bottlenecks, and (3) extending neural compressors to handle noisy channels and emerging data modalities.

**Research Objectives**  
This project aims to:  
1. Develop **FlowCodec**, a fully differentiable encoder-decoder architecture based on NFs, replacing quantization with continuous latent representations and explicit IB constraints.  
2. Establish theoretical guarantees on RD performance by linking variational bounds to the IB Lagrangian.  
3. Validate FlowCodec’s superiority over vector quantization (VQ)-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality, inference speed, and robustness.  
4. Extend the framework to joint source–channel coding by integrating channel noise into the flow-based latent space.  

**Significance**  
FlowCodec addresses critical gaps in neural compression by unifying information-theoretic principles with modern generative models. Its differentiable design enables end-to-end optimization, while provable RD bounds enhance interpretability. Applications span high-fidelity media compression, efficient model distillation, and robust communication systems. By bridging theory and practice, this work advances scalable, efficient information processing in resource-constrained environments.

### 3. **Methodology**  
**Research Design**  
The methodology integrates three components:  
1. **Continuous-Flow Encoder-Decoder Architecture**  
2. **Information-Bottleneck Regularization**  
3. **Theoretical Analysis and Experimental Validation**  

**Data Collection**  
Experiments will use standard image/video datasets (e.g., Kodak, CLIC, UVG) and multimodal benchmarks (e.g., LAION-5B for text-image pairs). Synthetic datasets with controlled noise will test robustness in joint source–channel coding scenarios.

**Algorithmic Framework**  
**Step 1: Encoder-Decoder Design**  
- **Encoder**: A normalizing flow $f_\theta$ maps input $x$ to a continuous latent $z = f_\theta(x)$, with tractable density $q(z|x)$.  
- **Dequantization**: Inject Gaussian noise $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2I)$ to $z$, yielding $\tilde{z} = z + \epsilon$.  
- **Decoder**: An inverse flow $f_\theta^{-1}$ reconstructs $\hat{x} = f_\theta^{-1}(\tilde{z})$.  

**Step 2: Information-Bottleneck Training**  
The loss function combines distortion and rate terms via a Lagrangian:  
$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{\text{data}}} \left[ \underbrace{D\left(x, \hat{x}\right)}_{\text{Distortion}} \right] + \beta \cdot \underbrace{\text{KL}\left(q(z|x) \parallel p(z)\right)}_{\text{Rate}},  
$$  
where $p(z)$ is a flexible flow prior (e.g., Gaussian mixture), and $\beta$ controls the RD trade-off.  

**Step 3: Rate-Distortion Analysis**  
Using variational $f$-divergence bounds, we derive theoretical limits on the achievable rate $R$:  
$$
R \leq \mathbb{E}_{x} \left[ \log \frac{q(z|x)}{p(z)} \right] + C,  
$$  
where $C$ is a constant dependent on the dequantization noise variance $\sigma^2$.  

**Step 4: Joint Source–Channel Coding Extension**  
Channel noise $\eta$ (e.g., AWGN) is modeled as an additional flow transformation:  
$$
\tilde{z}_{\text{channel}} = f_\phi(\tilde{z} + \eta),  
$$  
where $f_\phi$ is a noise-adaptive flow layer trained to preserve reconstruction quality under channel impairments.

**Experimental Validation**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against VQ-VAE, HiFiC, and integer-only discrete flows (IODF).  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Distortion**: PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS.  
  - **Rate**: Bits per pixel (bpp) or bits per dimension.  
  - **Efficiency**: Inference latency (ms), GPU memory usage.  
  - **Robustness**: Performance under varying channel SNR levels.  
- **Ablation Studies**: Analyze the impact of flow depth, prior flexibility, and $\beta$ scheduling.  

**Implementation Details**  
- **Architecture**: Use Glow-like multi-scale flows with affine coupling layers.  
- **Training**: Adam optimizer, learning rate $10^{-4}$, batch size 32.  
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Superior RD Performance**: FlowCodec is expected to outperform VQ-based methods by 1.5–2 dB in PSNR at equivalent bitrates, particularly preserving high-frequency details in images/videos.  
2. **Faster Inference**: Elimination of quantization lookup tables and integer operations will reduce latency by ~30% compared to IODF.  
3. **Theoretical Guarantees**: Proofs linking $\beta$ to RD bounds and channel noise resilience.  
4. **Generalization**: Demonstrated effectiveness across modalities (e.g., 3D medical imaging, LiDAR point clouds).  

**Impact**  
- **Practical Applications**: Deployable in edge devices for real-time video streaming, federated learning via compressed model updates, and low-latency telemedicine.  
- **Theoretical Advancements**: A unified IB-NF framework for analyzing neural compressors, enabling future work on optimal transport-driven compression.  
- **Sustainability**: Reduced energy consumption in data centers via efficient compression.
