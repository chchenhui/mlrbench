Title: SecEx-Health: Secure and Explainable Federated Multimodal Medical Foundation Model

Motivation:  
Medical foundation models promise to revolutionize diagnostics but are stalled by privacy concerns and opaque decision processes. SecEx-Health addresses these barriers by integrating federated learning with explainability, enabling safe, transparent AI assistance—especially in underserved and high-sensitivity clinical environments.

Main Idea:  
We design a transformer‐based multimodal foundation model that learns from decentralized CT scans, lab results, and clinical notes without ever moving raw data off‐site. Each hospital trains a local model update protected by differential privacy (ε≤1) and secure aggregation. A cross‐modal fusion backbone ingests heterogeneous inputs, while an attention‐driven explanation module produces saliency heatmaps and concept activation vectors to highlight critical symptoms and image regions. We will benchmark on multi‐center datasets, evaluating diagnostic accuracy (target ≥95% of centralized baseline), privacy leakage metrics, and clinician trust via structured user studies. SecEx‐Health aims to deliver robust, privacy‐preserving diagnostics and clinician‐friendly explanations, fostering broader adoption of trustworthy AI in healthcare.
