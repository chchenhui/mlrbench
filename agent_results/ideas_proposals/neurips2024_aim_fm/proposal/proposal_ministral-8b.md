# Causal Reasoning Meets Explainable Medical Foundation Models

## Introduction

Medical foundation models (MFMs) have shown significant promise in transforming healthcare by providing advanced decision support, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations. However, the widespread adoption of these models in clinical settings is hindered by their "black-box" nature, which makes it difficult for healthcare professionals to understand and trust the underlying decision-making processes. This lack of transparency is particularly problematic in high-stakes scenarios where patient outcomes are directly influenced by the AI's recommendations.

To address this challenge, this research proposal introduces **Causal-MFM**, a novel framework that integrates causal reasoning into MFMs to provide interpretable, action-aware explanations. By focusing on causal mechanisms rather than correlation, Causal-MFM aims to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of AI systems in healthcare. This work is motivated by the need for explainable AI that can be seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows, ensuring that medical professionals can make informed decisions based on clear and actionable insights.

### Research Objectives

1. **Causal Discovery**: Develop methods to learn causal graphs from multimodal medical data, enabling the identification of underlying causal relationships.
2. **Explainable AI Architecture**: Embed causal reasoning into the MFM architecture to generate interpretable explanations that reflect the causal mechanisms driving the model's decisions.
3. **Evaluation and Validation**: Collaborate with clinicians to validate the clarity, faithfulness, and context-specific utility of the causal explanations in tasks such as radiology report generation and electronic health record (EHR)-based prognosis.

### Significance

The proposed Causal-MFM framework addresses the critical need for explainable AI in healthcare, ensuring that medical professionals can trust and understand the AI's recommendations. By focusing on causal relationships, Causal-MFM enhances the interpretability of MFMs, making them more reliable and actionable in clinical settings. This work has the potential to improve patient outcomes, streamline clinical workflows, and advance the integration of AI in healthcare.

## Methodology

### Causal Discovery

The first step in the Causal-MFM framework is to discover causal relationships in multimodal medical data. This involves learning causal graphs that represent the underlying causal mechanisms governing the data. We propose the following methodology for causal discovery:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the multimodal medical data, handling missing values, noise, and biases to ensure data quality.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the multimodal data, including imaging features (e.g., from MRI or CT scans), textual features (e.g., from clinical notes), and sensor signal features (e.g., from wearable devices).
3. **Causal Graph Learning**: Use domain-specific constraints and causal discovery algorithms to learn causal graphs from the preprocessed data. Examples of causal discovery algorithms include:
   - **PC (Peter and Clark) Algorithm**: A constraint-based algorithm that identifies causal structures by leveraging conditional independence tests.
   - **FCI (Fast Causal Inference) Algorithm**: A score-based algorithm that estimates causal structures by maximizing a score function based on conditional independence tests.
   - **GES (Greedy Equivalence Search) Algorithm**: A search-based algorithm that iteratively adds edges to the causal graph to maximize a scoring function.

### Causal Explanation Module

Once the causal graphs have been learned, the next step is to embed the causal reasoning into the MFM architecture to generate interpretable explanations. We propose the following methodology for the causal explanation module:

1. **Explanation Generation**: For a given input, generate explanations that reflect the causal mechanisms driving the model's decisions. This can be done by:
   - **Counterfactual Analysis**: Construct hypothetical scenarios that alter specific input features and observe the changes in the model's output. This provides insights into the causal relationships between the input features and the model's predictions.
   - **Causal Bayesian Networks**: Use causal Bayesian networks to model the probabilistic relationships between the input features and the model's predictions. This enables the generation of explanations that reflect the underlying causal structures.
2. **Action-Awareness**: Incorporate action-awareness into the explanations by specifying the actions that should be taken based on the causal mechanisms identified. This can be done by:
   - **Recommending Treatments**: Based on the causal relationships between symptoms and treatments, recommend appropriate treatments for the patient.
   - **Identifying Risk Factors**: Identify risk factors that contribute to the patient's condition and suggest interventions to mitigate these risks.

### Evaluation and Validation

To validate the effectiveness and clinical utility of the Causal-MFM framework, we propose the following evaluation and validation methodology:

1. **Clinician Feedback**: Collaborate with healthcare professionals to evaluate the clarity, faithfulness, and context-specific utility of the causal explanations. This can be done through:
   - **Surveys and Interviews**: Conduct surveys and interviews with clinicians to gather feedback on the interpretability and actionability of the explanations.
   - **Case Studies**: Present the causal explanations to clinicians in the context of real-world clinical cases and assess their ability to inform decision-making.
2. **Ablation Tests**: Perform ablation tests to evaluate the impact of causal reasoning on the model's performance. This can be done by:
   - **Baseline Comparison**: Compare the performance of the Causal-MFM framework with baseline models that do not incorporate causal reasoning.
   - **Counterfactual Analysis**: Analyze the changes in the model's performance when specific causal relationships are altered or removed.
3. **Benchmarking**: Evaluate the performance of the Causal-MFM framework on benchmark datasets and tasks, such as radiology report generation and EHR-based prognosis. This can be done by:
   - **Accuracy and F1-Score**: Measure the accuracy and F1-score of the model's predictions compared to ground truth labels.
   - **Explanation Relevance**: Evaluate the relevance of the causal explanations by comparing them to ground truth causal relationships.
