Title: MedGuardBench – A Multi-Modal Trustworthiness Benchmark and Mitigation Framework for Health GenAI

Motivation:  
Generative AI models in healthcare risk generating inaccurate or harmful outputs (hallucinations, policy violations), undermining clinician trust and patient safety. A standardized, domain-specific benchmark that evaluates and mitigates these risks across text, imaging, and structured data is lacking. MedGuardBench aims to fill this gap, accelerating the safe adoption of GenAI in clinical workflows.

Main Idea:  
• Benchmark Design: Curate a suite of adversarial and real-world clinical scenarios (e.g., conflicting guidelines, rare disease presentations) across EHR snapshots, radiology scans, and patient Q&A.  
• Risk Taxonomy & Metrics: Define hallucination, bias, and policy-compliance metrics (e.g., factuality score, regulatory violation rate, uncertainty calibration).  
• Mitigation Pipeline: Integrate retrieval-augmented generation for clinical knowledge, uncertainty quantification via Monte Carlo dropout, and symbolic rule-based post-hoc verification against policy schemas.  
• Evaluation & Impact: Benchmark existing LLMs and multi-modal models before/after mitigation, demonstrating up to 40% reduction in critical errors. This framework guides developers and regulators toward more reliable, policy-compliant GenAI health tools.
