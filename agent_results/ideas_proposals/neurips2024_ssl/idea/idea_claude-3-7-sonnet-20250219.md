# Self-Supervised Counterfactual Learning for Robust Representation

## Motivation
Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated impressive empirical performance, yet theoretical frameworks explaining why certain auxiliary tasks outperform others remain limited. A critical gap exists in understanding how SSL methods acquire invariant representations that generalize across domains and tasks. By addressing the theoretical underpinnings of representational robustness in SSL, we can develop more principled approaches that maintain performance across distribution shifts and require less data for adaptation—a crucial advancement for real-world applications where labeled data is scarce or expensive.

## Main Idea
This research proposes a counterfactual information-theoretic framework for analyzing and designing SSL auxiliary tasks. The core insight is that effective SSL methods implicitly learn causal features by maximizing mutual information between representations of counterfactual views. We formally characterize the relationship between the invariance properties of learned representations and their ability to capture causal mechanisms underlying the data. By formulating this as a constrained optimization problem—maximizing task-relevant information while minimizing spurious correlations—we derive theoretical bounds on the sample complexity required for robust representation learning. The framework provides actionable design principles for constructing auxiliary tasks that explicitly promote learning of invariant features. We validate these principles through experiments across multiple domains, demonstrating that theoretically-motivated counterfactual SSL tasks require significantly fewer samples to achieve robust performance under distribution shifts compared to conventional approaches.
