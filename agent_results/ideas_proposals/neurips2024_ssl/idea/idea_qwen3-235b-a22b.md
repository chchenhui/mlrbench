1. **Title**: Information Bottleneck-Driven Self-Supervised Learning: Bridging Theory and Practice via Mutual Information Optimization  

2. **Motivation**: Despite SSL's empirical success, the lack of theoretical principles for designing auxiliary tasks and understanding representations hampers further progress. Existing methods like contrastive learning or masked modeling lack formal guarantees on what information their pretrained representations retain. This gap limits SSL’s applicability in critical domains (e.g., healthcare, neuroscience) where trust in learned representations is paramount.  

3. **Main Idea**: We propose framing SSL as an *information bottleneck* (IB) problem: learn compressed input representations that preserve task-relevant information while discarding irrelevant details. By formalizing SSL objectives through mutual information (MI) terms—e.g., maximizing $I(\text{representation}; \text{context})$ while minimizing $I(\text{representation}; \text{input})$—we aim to derive theoretical bounds for SSL sample complexity and auxiliary task design. Methodologically, we will: (1) analyze existing SSL methods under this IB framework to quantify their implicit MI trade-offs; (2) design novel augmentation-agnostic auxiliary tasks explicitly optimizing these bounds using tractable MI estimators; (3) validate theoretical insights on diverse modalities (images, text, time-series) and compare performance against empirical baselines. Expected outcomes include a unified theoretical lens for diagnosing SSL methods and a practical algorithm that improves representation efficiency for downstream tasks. This work aims to reduce reliance on heuristic task design and enable principled SSL development in data-scarce or high-stakes domains.
