## 1. Title

**Principled Design of Auxiliary Tasks via Information Disentanglement in Self-Supervised Learning**

## 2. Introduction

**Background:**
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm in representation learning, achieving remarkable success across diverse domains like computer vision (He et al., 2022; Caron et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2020a; Grill et al., 2020), natural language processing (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023), and speech processing (Baevski et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2023). By leveraging unlabeled data through ingeniously designed auxiliary tasks—such as contrastive learning (Chen et al., 2020a; He et al., 2020), masked autoencoding (He et al., 2022; Devlin et al., 2019), or instance discrimination (Wu et al., 2018)—SSL methods learn powerful representations that often match or exceed those learned with full supervision, particularly when labeled data is scarce. The scalability of SSL, particularly evident in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), underscores its transformative potential.

However, as highlighted by the workshop theme, a significant gap persists between the empirical triumphs of SSL and its theoretical foundations. Many state-of-the-art auxiliary tasks are designed based on heuristics and empirical intuition rather than rigorous theoretical principles. Key questions remain unanswered: Why do certain tasks yield better representations than others? What properties of the data distribution and task design lead to effective learning? How much unlabeled data is truly necessary? How do architectural choices interact with SSL objectives? Addressing these questions is crucial for moving beyond incremental empirical improvements and unlocking the full potential of SSL, enabling the design of more robust, efficient, and tailored representation learning algorithms.

**Problem Statement:**
The current reliance on heuristic design for SSL auxiliary tasks presents several limitations. Firstly, it hinders our fundamental understanding of *why* and *how* SSL works. Without a theoretical grounding, it is difficult to predict the performance of a given task on new data modalities or under different constraints. Secondly, heuristic approaches make it challenging to systematically design tasks optimized for specific downstream requirements, such as robustness to out-of-distribution samples, fairness across demographic groups, or disentanglement of specific factors of variation. Existing popular methods, like contrastive learning (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo) or non-contrastive methods (e.g., BYOL, SimSiam), primarily focus on ensuring invariance to predefined augmentations, but the precise information captured and discarded lacks formal characterization. While some works have begun exploring information-theoretic perspectives (e.g., [5, 7, 8, 9] in the provided review) or disentanglement ([1, 2, 3, 6, 10]), a comprehensive framework that uses information disentanglement as a *generative principle* for designing diverse SSL tasks is still missing. This gap is particularly relevant given the challenges identified in the literature review, such as the difficulty in achieving effective disentanglement and balancing multiple information-theoretic objectives.

**Proposed Solution:**
This research proposes a principled, theory-driven framework for designing SSL auxiliary tasks based on the concept of **information disentanglement**. The core hypothesis is that effective SSL representations should primarily capture the stable, **invariant** semantic content shared across different augmented views of the same data point, while actively discarding unstable, **variant** information arising from the augmentation process itself or other nuisance factors specific to each view.

We propose to formalize this principle using mutual information (MI). Specifically, we aim to design auxiliary tasks that:
1.  **Maximize Mutual Information between representations of different views** ($z_1, z_2$) of the same input ($x$). This encourages the representations to capture the shared, invariant information ($I_{inv}$) essential for downstream tasks. $I(Z_1; Z_2)$ serves as a proxy for this shared information.
2.  **Minimize Mutual Information between the representation of a view** ($z_i$) **and variables representing view-specific nuisance information** ($V_i$). This explicitly encourages the representation to discard irrelevant, variant details ($I_{var}$) introduced by the augmentation process or other sources of unwanted variation.

By formulating SSL objectives that jointly optimize these two MI goals, we aim to derive novel, theoretically grounded loss functions that promote the learning of robust and transferable representations with desired invariance properties. This framework offers a systematic way to move beyond heuristic task design.

**Research Objectives:**
The primary objectives of this research are:

1.  **Formalize the Information Disentanglement Framework:** Develop a rigorous mathematical framework for SSL based on maximizing invariant information and minimizing variant information using mutual information objectives. This includes defining the invariant ($I_{inv}$) and variant ($I_{var}$) information components in the context of common data augmentations.
2.  **Derive Novel Auxiliary Tasks:** Instantiate the framework to derive concrete contrastive and non-contrastive loss functions. This involves specifying suitable MI estimators and defining the nuisance variables ($V_i$) associated with augmentations.
3.  **Empirical Validation:** Implement the proposed tasks and rigorously evaluate their performance against established heuristic-based SSL methods (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, MAE) on standard benchmark datasets across different modalities (initially focusing on vision).
4.  **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Assess the quality of learned representations using multiple criteria:
    *   Downstream Task Performance (linear probing, fine-tuning).
    *   Transferability to related tasks and datasets.
    *   Robustness to natural corruptions, adversarial attacks, and domain shifts.
    *   Quantifiable metrics of disentanglement concerning augmentation parameters.
    *   Sample efficiency compared to baseline methods.
5.  **Theoretical Analysis:** Analyze the properties of the proposed framework and loss functions, potentially establishing connections between the MI objectives, the degree of disentanglement achieved, and observed empirical performance (e.g., robustness).

**Significance:**
This research holds significant potential for advancing the field of Self-Supervised Learning. By providing a principled framework for auxiliary task design grounded in information theory, it addresses a critical gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding, directly responding to the core theme of the workshop. Success in this project would yield:

*   **Deeper Theoretical Understanding:** Offering insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying effective SSL and the role of information flow D disentanglement.
*   **Improved SSL Methods:** Potentially leading to SSL algorithms that learn more robust, transferable, and semantically meaningful representations compared to existing heuristic approaches.
*   **Systematic Task Design:** Enabling researchers and practitioners to design SSL tasks tailored for specific requirements (e.g., enhanced robustness, fairness, specific invariances) rather than relying solely on trial-and-error.
*   **Bridging Theory and Practice:** Providing concrete algorithms derived from theoretical principles and validating them empirically, fostering the dialogue encouraged by the workshop.
*   **Foundation for Future Work:** The framework could be extended to more complex data modalities (graphs, time-series, multimodal data) and incorporate other constraints or inductive biases.

## 3. Methodology

This section details the proposed research design, including the theoretical formulation, algorithmic steps, data, experimental setup, and evaluation metrics.

**3.1 Theoretical Framework: Information Disentanglement Objective**

Let $x$ be an input data point from a distribution $P_X$. Let $T$ be a stochastic data augmentation process that generates pairs of augmented views $(x_1, x_2) \sim T(x)$. Let $f_\theta: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Z}$ be a neural network encoder (parameterized by $\theta$) that maps an input view $x_i$ to a representation $z_i = f_\theta(x_i)$. We posit that each view $x_i$ contains underlying semantic information shared with $x$ (and thus $x_j$ for $j \neq i$), along with view-specific nuisance information introduced by the augmentation $T$. Let $V_i$ denote the random variables capturing this nuisance information specific to view $x_i$. For instance, if $T$ involves random cropping and color jitter, $V_i$ could represent the specific crop coordinates and jitter parameters applied to generate $x_i$.

Our goal is to learn an encoder $f_\theta$ such that the representation $Z_i$ captures the shared information between views while being invariant to the nuisance $V_i$. We formalize this using mutual information (MI):

1.  **Maximize Shared Information:** We want $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ to share as much information as possible, implying they both capture the underlying semantics of $x$. This is achieved by maximizing the mutual information $I(Z_1; Z_2)$.
2.  **Minimize Nuisance Information:** We want $Z_i$ to contain minimal information about the specific augmentation $V_i$ that generated $x_i$. This is achieved by minimizing the mutual information $I(Z_i; V_i)$ for $i=1, 2$.

Combining these, we propose a general objective function for information-disentangled SSL:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{ID-SSL}(\theta) = - \alpha I(Z_1; Z_2) + \beta \sum_{i=1}^{2} I(Z_i; V_i) \quad (*)
$$

where $Z_1 = f_\theta(X_1)$, $Z_2 = f_\theta(X_2)$, $(X_1, X_2) \sim T(X)$, and $X \sim P_X$. The variables $V_i$ represent the specific parameters of the transformation applied to $X$ to get $X_i$. $\alpha > 0$ and $\beta > 0$ are hyperparameters balancing the two objectives. Minimizing $\mathcal{L}_{ID-SSL}$ corresponds to maximizing shared information and minimizing nuisance information.

**3.2 Estimating Mutual Information**

Directly optimizing MI based on Equation (*) is challenging as MI is notoriously hard to compute, especially in high dimensions. We will leverage existing and potentially develop new MI estimators suitable for deep learning:

*   **Estimating $I(Z_1; Z_2)$:**
    *   **InfoNCE:** For contrastive settings, the widely used InfoNCE loss provides a lower bound on MI (Oord et al., 2018; Poole et al., 2019).
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{InfoNCE} = - \mathbb{E} \left[ \log \frac{\exp(z_1^T z_2 / \tau)}{\exp(z_1^T z_2 / \tau) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \exp(z_1^T z_{k}^- / \tau)} \right] $$
    Maximizing this term maximizes the lower bound on $I(Z_1; Z_2)$. Here $z_k^-$ are representations of negative samples, and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.
    *   **Other Estimators:** We may explore alternative estimators like MINE (Belghazi et al., 2018) or methods used in non-contrastive SSL that implicitly maximize similarity.

*   **Estimating $I(Z_i; V_i)$:**
    *   **Variational Upper Bounds:** We can use variational methods to obtain an upper bound on $I(Z_i; V_i)$ and minimize this bound. For instance, the CLUB estimator (Cheng et al., 2020) provides a tractable upper bound:
    $$ I(Z_i; V_i) \leq \mathbb{E}_{p(z_i, v_i)}[\log q_\phi(v_i | z_i)] - \mathbb{E}_{p(z_i)p(v_i)}[\log q_\phi(v_i | z_i)] $$
    where $q_\phi(v_i | z_i)$ is a variational approximation (e.g., a neural network) to the true conditional $p(v_i | z_i)$. Minimizing this upper bound serves as a proxy for minimizing $I(Z_i; V_i)$. This aligns with ideas from learning disentangled representations ([3, 10]).
    *   **Adversarial/Predictive Methods:** An alternative is to train an auxiliary predictor network to predict $V_i$ from $Z_i$. The main encoder $f_\theta$ is then trained to make this prediction task harder (e.g., via gradient reversal or minimizing prediction accuracy), implicitly minimizing the information $Z_i$ contains about $V_i$.

**3.3 Proposed Auxiliary Tasks**

Based on Equation (*) and the MI estimators, we will derive concrete loss functions:

1.  **Information-Disentangled Contrastive Learning (ID-CL):**
    We combine InfoNCE with an MI minimization term for nuisance variables:
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{ID-CL} = \mathcal{L}_{InfoNCE}(Z_1, Z_2) + \beta \sum_{i=1}^{2} \hat{I}_{upper}(Z_i; V_i) $$
    where $\hat{I}_{upper}(Z_i; V_i)$ is a tractable upper bound estimator like CLUB, potentially requiring an auxiliary network $q_\phi$. $V_i$ will represent the parameters of the augmentation used for $x_i$.

2.  **Information-Disentangled Non-Contrastive Learning (ID-NCL):**
    We adapt non-contrastive methods like BYOL or SimSiam, which typically use a similarity loss (e.g., MSE) between projected representations, often with stop-gradients and predictor heads. We add the MI minimization term:
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{ID-NCL} = \mathcal{L}_{Sim}(p(Z_1), sg(Z_2)) + \mathcal{L}_{Sim}(p(Z_2), sg(Z_1)) + \beta \sum_{i=1}^{2} \hat{I}_{upper}(Z_i; V_i) $$
    where $\mathcal{L}_{Sim}$ is a similarity loss (e.g., negative cosine similarity), $p$ is a predictor head, and $sg$ denotes stop-gradient. The $\hat{I}_{upper}$ term encourages disentanglement from augmentation details.

**3.4 Model Architecture**

We will use standard backbone architectures appropriate for the chosen domain.
*   **Vision:** ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016) for experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR.
*   **Encoder:** $ f_\theta $ will be the backbone network.
*   **Projection Head:** Following standard SSL practice (Chen et al., 2020a), a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) projection head $g(\cdot)$ will map the backbone output to the space where the MI maximization objective ($I(Z_1; Z_2)$ or similarity loss) is computed. $z_i = g(f_\theta(x_i))$.
*   **MI Minimization Head (if needed):** For estimators like CLUB, an auxiliary network $q_\phi(v_i | z_i)$ will be implemented, taking $z_i$ (or potentially the backbone output) as input and predicting the distribution of $V_i$.

Crucially, the nuisance variables $V_i$ need to be explicitly defined and accessible during training. For standard image augmentations (crop, flip, color jitter, grayscale, blur), $V_i$ will be a vector containing the parameters specifying the exact transformation applied (e.g., crop bounding box coordinates, jitter magnitudes, blur kernel size).

**3.5 Data Collection and Datasets**

We will primarily focus on established image datasets for rigorous comparison with existing methods:
*   **CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100:** Smaller datasets for rapid prototyping and ablation studies.
*   **ImageNet (ILSVRC-2012):** The standard large-scale benchmark for SSL pre-training in vision. We will use the 1.28 million image unlabeled training set for pre-training.
*   **Tiny ImageNet:** A subset of ImageNet, useful for faster experimentation cycles.
*   **Synthetic Data (Optional):** We may use controlled synthetic datasets (e.g., dSprites, Shapes3D) where ground-truth factors of variation are known, allowing for more precise evaluation of disentanglement if needed.

**3.6 Experimental Design**

1.  **Baseline Comparisons:** We will compare our proposed methods (ID-CL, ID-NCL) against strong SSL baselines:
    *   Contrastive: SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020a), MoCo v2/v3 (Chen et al., 2020b; He et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021).
    *   Non-Contrastive: BYOL (Grill et al., 2020), SimSiam (Chen & He, 2021).
    *   Masked Image Modeling: MAE (He et al., 2022).
    We will ensure fair comparisons by using the same encoder architecture, pre-training data, compute budget (e.g., epochs), and optimizer settings where possible.

2.  **Ablation Studies:**
    *   Analyze the impact of the disentanglement coefficient $\beta$.
    *   Compare different MI estimators for $I(Z_i; V_i)$.
    *   Investigate the effect of different augmentation strategies and the definition of $V_i$.
    *   Compare the contrastive (ID-CL) vs. non-contrastive (ID-NCL) instantiations.
    *   Evaluate the contribution of each component of the loss function.

3.  **Training Protocol:**
    *   **Pre-training:** Train models using the proposed and baseline SSL objectives on the unlabeled training set (e.g., ImageNet) for a standard number of epochs (e.g., 100, 200, or 800 epochs, depending on the baseline comparison). We will use standard optimizers like AdamW or LARS with appropriate learning rate schedules and batch sizes.
    *   **Downstream Evaluation:** After pre-training, the encoder $f_\theta$ is frozen, and its representations are evaluated on various downstream tasks.

**3.7 Evaluation Metrics**

We will evaluate the learned representations using a comprehensive set of metrics:

1.  **Linear Probing:** Train a linear classifier on top of the frozen representations from $f_\theta$ (or a specific layer) for image classification tasks (e.g., ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100). Report top-1 accuracy. This measures the linear separability of the learned features.
2.  **Fine-tuning:** Fine-tune the entire pre-trained encoder $f_\theta$ on downstream tasks (e.g., smaller classification datasets like CUB-200, Flowers-102, or object detection/segmentation tasks if resources permit) using a smaller learning rate. Report task-specific metrics (accuracy, mAP). This measures the transferability of the features.
3.  **Robustness:** Evaluate the performance of the linear probing model (or fine-tuned model) on benchmark datasets designed to test robustness:
    *   **Natural Corruptions:** ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019). Report mean Corruption Error (mCE).
    *   **Adversarial Attacks:** Evaluate robustness against standard attacks like PGD (Madry et al., 2018). Report accuracy under attack.
    *   **Domain Shift:** Evaluate on datasets like ImageNet-R (Rendition), ImageNet-Sketch, or ObjectNet. Report accuracy.
    We hypothesize that explicit disentanglement of augmentation nuisance $V_i$ may lead to improved robustness.
4.  **Disentanglement Quantification:** Measure the degree to which information about the augmentation parameters $V_i$ is encoded in the representation $Z_i$. This can be measured by the performance of the auxiliary network $q_\phi(v_i | z_i)$ used in the CLUB estimator (lower performance implies better disentanglement), or by training a separate MLP probe to predict $V_i$ from frozen $Z_i$. Report prediction accuracy or R-squared. Compare against baselines where $I(Z_i; V_i)$ is not explicitly minimized.
5.  **Sample Efficiency:** Train models using different fractions of the pre-training data (e.g., 1%, 10%, 100% of ImageNet) and evaluate downstream performance (linear probing). Compare performance curves to assess how quickly each method learns useful representations.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact

**Expected Outcomes:**

1.  **A Novel Information-Theoretic Framework:** A well-defined theoretical framework for designing SSL auxiliary tasks based on maximizing shared information ($I(Z_1; Z_2)$) and minimizing nuisance information ($I(Z_i; V_i)$).

6.  **Open Source Code:** Publicly released codebase containing implementations of the proposed methods, evaluation scripts, and pre-trained models to facilitate reproducibility and future research.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Scientific Advancement:** This research will contribute to a deeper, more principled understanding of SSL, moving the field beyond heuristic task design. It bridges information theory and practical deep learning, addressing a key challenge highlighted in the SSL community and the workshop call. The framework could unify or provide theoretical justification for existing methods and inspire new directions.
*   **Improved Representation Learning:** The derived algorithms have the potential to outperform existing methods, particularly in terms of robustness and transferability, by explicitly optimizing for disentanglement from nuisance factors. This could lead to more reliable AI systems deployed in real-world scenarios with potential distribution shifts or corruptions.
*   **Tailored SSL Design:** The framework provides a methodology for designing SSL tasks tailored to specific needs. For instance, by carefully defining the nuisance variables $V_i$ to include factors related to bias (e.g., demographic attributes if available non-semantically) or specific environmental conditions, one could potentially train models with enhanced fairness or robustness to those specific factors.
*   **Informing Future Research:** The findings could influence the design of future SSL algorithms, including those for LLMs or multimodal learning, where principled understanding and control over learned representations are increasingly important. The insights might also connect to cognitive science theories about how humans learn invariant representations.
*   **Fostering Theory-Practice Dialogue:** By developing theoretically motivated algorithms and validating them through rigorous empirical evaluation, this work directly contributes to the dialogue between SSL theory and practice, a central aim of the workshop.
