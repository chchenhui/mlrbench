#### **Title**  
**Principled Design of Auxiliary Tasks via Information Disentanglement in Self-Supervised Learning**

---

### **1. Introduction**

#### **Background**  
Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for representation learning, enabling models to learn semantic features from unlabeled data through auxiliary tasks. Contrastive methods (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo) and non-contrastive approaches (e.g., BYOL, MAE) have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving supervised-level performance across vision, language, and speech. Despite these empirical advances, the design of auxiliary tasks remains largely heuristic, with limited theoretical insights into **why** certain tasks yield superior representations. This gap hinders the development of domain-specific SSL frameworks and limits adaptability to downstream tasks requiring robustness, fairness, or interpretability.

#### **Research Objectives**  
This work proposes a **theory-driven framework** for auxiliary task design by formalizing SSL as an information disentanglement problem. The objectives are:  
1. **Theoretical**: Derive a principled objective to disentangle invariant (shared across data views) and variant (view-specific) information using mutual information (MI).  
2. **Algorithmic**: Develop novel contrastive and non-contrastive loss functions grounded in this theory.  
3. **Empirical**: Validate the framework across vision, language, and multimodal benchmarks, assessing transferability, robustness, and disentanglement quality.

#### **Significance**  
By linking SSL theory to practice through information-theoretic principles, this work will:  
- Provide actionable guidelines for task design in resource-constrained or domain-specific scenarios.  
- Enhance model generalization by explicitly separating nuisance factors (e.g., lighting, text style).  
- Bridge the divide between theoretical analysis (e.g., MI bounds, representation sufficiency) and empirical SSL advances.  

#### **Relation to Existing Work**  
The proposal builds on recent literature (e.g., DisentangledSSL [2024], InfoNCE-based losses [2023]) but introduces two key innovations:  
1. A **unified MI objective** that jointly maximizes shared information and suppresses view-specific biases.  
2. **Modality-agnostic** formulations enabling application to images, text, time-series, and graphs.

### **2. Methodology**

#### **2.1 Theoretical Framework**  
Let $ \mathcal{X} $ denote the input space (e.g., images, sequences) and $ T: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X} $ a stochastic augmentation to generate two correlated views $ x_1, x_2 $ of the same instance. The encoder network $ f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Z} $ maps inputs to representations $ z_1 = f(x_1) $, $ z_2 = f(x_2) $. Our objective is to disentangle invariant $ s \in \mathcal{S} $ and variant $ v \in \mathcal{V} $ components:  
- **Shared invariant features** ($ s $): Capture information invariant to augmentations.  
- **View-specific variant features** ($ v $): Encode nuisances like lighting, cropping, or style.  

This disentanglement is formalized via the following **mutual information objectives**:  
1. **Maximize MI between shared features**:  
   $$  
   \max_{f} \ I(s_1; s_2)  
   $$  
   where $ s_1 = \pi(z_1) $, $ s_2 = \pi(z_2) $ projects representations into a shared subspace (e.g., via a linear head).  
2. **Minimize MI between variant features**:  
   $$  
   \min_{f} \ I(v_1; v_2)  
   $$  
   where $ v_1 = z_1 - \text{Proj}(z_1 | s_1) $, and $ \text{Proj} $ denotes projection to isolate components orthogonal to $ s $.  

This dual objective ensures representations focus on task-relevant invariance while discarding distractors.  

#### **2.2 Algorithmic Implementation**  

**Model Architecture**  
The encoder $ f $ is parameterized as a deep network (e.g., Vision Transformer for images, BERT for text). We define two heads:  
- A **shared projection head** $ \pi $, mapping $ z $ to a normalized unit vector $ s $.  
- A **variant projection head** $ \rho $, mapping $ z $ to $ v $.  

**Contrastive Loss with Disentanglement (DCL)**  
We extend InfoNCE by decoupling shared and variant components:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{DCL}} = -\mathbb{E}_{x_1, x_2} \left[ \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(s_1, s_2)/\tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^{N}\exp(\text{sim}(s_1, s_k)/\tau)} + \lambda \cdot \text{sim}(v_1, v_2)^2 \right]  
$$  
Here, $ \text{sim}(a, b) $ denotes cosine similarity, $ \tau $ is a temperature hyperparameter, and $ \lambda $ balances the terms. The first term aligns shared features via contrastive learning, while the regularization penalizes alignment of variant features.  

**Non-Contrastive Loss with Redundancy Reduction (NC-Disentangled)**  
We adapt Barlow Twins by enforcing cross-correlation matrix structure:  
$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{NC-Disentangled}} = \| \mathcal{C}(s_1, s_2) - I \|_{F}^2 + \| \mathcal{C}(v_1, v_2) \|_{F}^2  
$$  
Here, $ \mathcal{C}(a, b) $ is the empirical cross-correlation matrix, and the first term maximizes shared feature alignment. The second term suppresses variant feature redundancy.
