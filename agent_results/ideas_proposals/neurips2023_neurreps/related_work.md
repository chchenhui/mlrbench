   - **Authors**: Ming Lei, Christophe Baehr
   - **Summary**: This work establishes a unified framework integrating geometric flows with deep learning through three key innovations: a thermodynamically coupled Ricci flow that adapts parameter space geometry to loss landscape topology, explicit phase transition thresholds and critical learning rates derived through curvature blowup analysis, and an AdS/CFT-type holographic duality between neural networks and conformal field theories. The framework demonstrates accelerated convergence and topological simplification while maintaining computational efficiency, outperforming Riemannian baselines in few-shot accuracy.

   - **Authors**: David R. Wessels, David M. Knigge, Samuele Papa, Riccardo Valperga, Sharvaree Vadgama, Efstratios Gavves, Erik J. Bekkers
   - **Summary**: This paper proposes Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs), a novel conditional neural field architecture that incorporates geometric information through a geometry-informed cross-attention mechanism. By conditioning the neural field on a latent point cloud of features, ENFs achieve equivariant decoding from latent space to field, ensuring that both field and latent representations transform consistently under geometric transformations. This approach enables faithful representation of geometric patterns and efficient learning across datasets of fields, leading to improved performance in tasks such as classification, segmentation, forecasting, reconstruction, and generative modeling.
