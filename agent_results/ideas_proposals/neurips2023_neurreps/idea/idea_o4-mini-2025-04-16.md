Title: Fiber Bundleâ€“Equivariant Latent Dynamics for Motor Cortex

Motivation:  
Neural activity in motor cortex evolves on low-dimensional manifolds with intrinsic symmetry (e.g., rotational invariance of limb configurations). Existing latent-dynamics models ignore this geometric structure, limiting robustness, interpretability, and generalization to novel postures or perturbations.

Main Idea:  
We propose to model population activity as sections of a principal fiber bundle over a Lie group representing body-frame transformations (e.g., SE(3)). An encoder maps neural spikes to bundle coordinates, enforcing equivariance via gauge-equivariant convolutions on the base manifold. A geometric-integrator RNN propagates latent states along learned connections, yielding dynamics constrained to respect group symmetries. A decoder reconstructs observed firing rates by pulling back bundle sections. Training minimizes reconstruction loss plus a curvature regularizer to promote smooth connections. We will validate on monkey-reach datasets, demonstrating superior decoding accuracy, robustness to unseen postural transformations, and interpretable geodesic trajectories corresponding to muscle synergies. This framework bridges geometric deep learning and neuroscience, revealing how symmetry shapes cortical control.
