# Neural Geometry Preservation: A Unified Framework for Geometric Stability in Biological and Artificial Neural Systems

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Neural systems, both biological and artificial, demonstrate a remarkable capability to preserve the geometric and topological structure of the data they process. This preservation is evident across diverse neural architectures, from the head direction cells in flies to grid cells in mammals, and from convolutional neural networks to geometric deep learning models. Recent research has shown that neural circuits often mirror the geometric and topological structure of the systems they represent, either through their synaptic connectivity or in the manifold structure generated by their activity patterns (Bronstein et al., 2023; Monti et al., 2023).

The preservation of geometric structure appears to be a fundamental computational strategy employed by neural systems to maintain critical information throughout processing stages. In biological systems, this is exemplified by grid cells that form hexagonal firing patterns representing navigational space, and head direction cells that maintain a topology isomorphic to a circle. Similarly, in artificial neural networks, approaches like equivariant neural networks (Ben-Hamu et al., 2023) and geometric deep learning (Bronstein et al., 2023) deliberately incorporate geometric priors to preserve the structure of input data, resulting in demonstrable improvements in computational efficiency, robustness, and generalization performance.

Despite the growing evidence for geometric preservation as a core principle in neural computation, current research lacks a unified theoretical framework that can explain why and how this preservation emerges across different neural substrates. The convergence of findings between neuroscience and deep learning suggests the existence of deeper, substrate-agnostic principles for information processing that remain to be fully articulated.

### Research Objectives

This research proposes to develop a formal framework called Neural Geometry Preservation (NGP) that quantifies and characterizes how well neural systems—both biological and artificial—maintain the geometric structure of their inputs across processing stages. The specific objectives are:

1. To develop rigorous mathematical metrics that quantify geometric distortion in neural representations across processing stages.

2. To derive theoretical proofs for optimal geometric preservation strategies under different computational constraints.

3. To establish experimental protocols for testing the NGP framework across diverse biological neural circuits and artificial neural networks.

4. To identify common principles governing effective neural representations across different substrates.

5. To apply the NGP framework to design novel neural network architectures with improved generalization, robustness, and sample efficiency.

### Significance

The development of a unified framework for neural geometric preservation holds significant implications for both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. By identifying and formalizing the principles governing geometric preservation in neural representations, this research could:

1. Provide a deeper theoretical understanding of why certain neural coding strategies have evolved in biological systems.

2. Inform the design of more efficient and robust artificial neural networks based on principles derived from both biological systems and mathematical theory.

3. Bridge the gap between neuroscience and deep learning, fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration and innovation.

4. Contribute to the development of more interpretable AI systems by making explicit the geometric transformations occurring within neural networks.

5. Advance our understanding of how the brain forms useful representations of the world, potentially informing treatments for neurological disorders characterized by distorted representations.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Theoretical Framework Development

#### 2.1.1 Geometric Distortion Metrics

We will develop a suite of mathematically rigorous metrics to quantify how well neural systems preserve geometric and topological properties across processing stages. These metrics will be designed to capture different aspects of geometric distortion:

**Local Distortion Metric (LDM)**: To measure the preservation of local geometric relationships, we define a metric that quantifies how well a neural representation preserves distances between nearby points:

$$\text{LDM}(f) = \frac{1}{|S|} \sum_{(x,y) \in S} \left| \frac{d_Y(f(x), f(y))}{d_X(x, y)} - 1 \right|$$

where $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is the neural mapping function, $S$ is a set of pairs of nearby points, $d_X$ and $d_Y$ are distance metrics in the input and representation spaces, respectively.

**Global Structure Preservation Index (GSPI)**: To assess how well global structures are preserved, we will employ a metric based on persistent homology:

$$\text{GSPI}(f) = 1 - \frac{W_p(D_X, D_Y)}{\max(D_X, D_Y)}$$

where $W_p$ is the $p$-Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams $D_X$ and $D_Y$ derived from the input and output spaces, respectively.

**Equivariance Error Measure (EEM)**: To quantify how well neural representations maintain equivariance with respect to relevant transformation groups:

$$\text{EEM}(f, G) = \mathbb{E}_{x \in X, g \in G} \left[ \|f(g \cdot x) - \rho(g) \cdot f(x)\|^2 \right]$$

where $G$ is a transformation group, $g \cdot x$ denotes the action of transformation $g$ on input $x$, and $\rho(g)$ is the corresponding transformation in the representation space.

#### 2.1.2 Theoretical Proofs for Optimal Preservation

We will establish mathematical proofs for optimal geometric preservation strategies under different computational constraints. Our approach will:

1. Define a class of neural architectures parameterized by $\theta \in \Theta$.

2. For each architecture, define a geometric preservation score $P(\theta)$ based on our distortion metrics.

3. Establish resource constraints $R(\theta) \leq c$ (e.g., computational complexity, memory usage).

4. Solve the constrained optimization problem:

$$\theta^* = \arg\max_{\theta \in \Theta} P(\theta) \text{ subject to } R(\theta) \leq c$$

We will develop proofs for specific cases, such as:

- Optimal linear projections that preserve pairwise distances
- Network architectures that minimize equivariance error for specific transformation groups
- Topological constraints on neural architectures to guarantee structure preservation

### 2.2 Computational Implementation

4. **Visualization Module**: Provides interactive visualizations of geometry distortion across network layers or brain regions.

#### 2.2.2 NGP-Enhanced Neural Network Framework

We will implement a neural network framework that incorporates geometric preservation principles:

1. **NGP Regularization**: Add regularization terms based on our distortion metrics to standard neural network training objectives:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda_{\text{LDM}} \cdot \text{LDM}(f) + \lambda_{\text{GSPI}} \cdot (1 - \text{GSPI}(f)) + \lambda_{\text{EEM}} \cdot \text{EEM}(f, G)$$

2. **Geometry-Preserving Layers**: Develop specialized neural network layers that guarantee certain forms of geometric preservation, inspired by approaches such as:
   - Group equivariant convolutional networks (Cohen & Welling, 2016)
   - Neural forms on simplicial complexes (Maggs et al., 2023)
   - Equivariant neural fields (Wessels et al., 2024)
