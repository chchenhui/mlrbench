**Title:** Asynchronous Layer-wise Dynamic Routing for Real-Time Edge Learning  

**Motivation:** Global end-to-end learning struggles with scalability and real-time adaptability on resource-constrained edge devices, which require low-latency, decentralized updates. Current methods rely on synchronized training, which is infeasible for applications like autonomous drones or IoT sensors processing dynamic, high-velocity data streams.  

**Main Idea:** Propose a localized learning framework where edge devices independently train disjoint subsets of model layers using on-device data, guided by layer-specific local objectives (e.g., reconstruction error or contrastive signals). To enable coordination, incorporate dynamic input routing: lightweight controllers on each device direct data to relevant layers based on input characteristics, triggering asynchronous layer updates. A lightweight consensus protocol periodically aligns layer parameters across devices via constrained averaging, avoiding global synchronization. Expected outcomes include (1) reduced per-device memory footprint by distributing layer ownership, (2) near-real-time updates by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (3) improved robustness via layer-specific adaptation to localized data distributions. Evaluations will focus on video stream adaptation and federated scenarios, measuring latency, accuracy retention, and communication overhead. If successful, this could enable scalable, low-cost learning for distributed edge systems.
