# EdgePLAS: Edge-based Plasticity-driven Localized Asynchronous System for Distributed Learning

## 1. Introduction

### Background
The pervasive deployment of edge computing systems has transformed our approach to data processing and analysis, shifting from centralized cloud computing to distributed edge networks. This paradigm shift presents unique challenges for machine learning systems, particularly in deploying sophisticated neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices. Traditional deep learning methods rely heavily on global end-to-end learning frameworks, which require synchronized, centralized computation across all network layers. While effective in controlled environments, this approach faces significant limitations in edge computing contexts due to resource constraints, communication bottlenecks, and reliability issues.

Edge computing networks typically consist of heterogeneous devices with varying computational capabilities, memory constraints, and intermittent connectivity. These characteristics make global backpropagation-based learning impractical for several reasons: (1) the synchronization requirements introduce substantial communication overhead and latency; (2) the memory footprint needed for storing activation gradients exceeds the capacity of many edge devices; and (3) the approach lacks robustness to device failures or network interruptions. Furthermore, global backpropagation bears little resemblance to learning in biological neural systems, which operate through localized, asynchronous synaptic updates without a centralized control mechanism.

Recent advances in decentralized and federated learning have attempted to address some of these challenges. Works such as AEDFL (Liu et al., 2023) and DRACO (Jeong & Kountouris, 2024) have proposed asynchronous training frameworks that reduce synchronization requirements. However, these approaches still fundamentally rely on gradient-based optimization and face challenges with model staleness, communication overhead, and adaptation to heterogeneous environments.

### Research Objectives
This research proposes EdgePLAS (Edge-based Plasticity-driven Localized Asynchronous System), a novel framework that transcends traditional backpropagation-based learning to enable truly decentralized, asynchronous learning on edge networks. Our objectives are:

1. To develop a biologically inspired learning framework that enables each edge device to train neural network components using local, gradient-free learning rules based on synaptic plasticity principles.

2. To design efficient knowledge sharing mechanisms that allow edge devices to periodically exchange compressed representations without requiring continuous synchronization.

3. To create adaptive plasticity rate controllers that dynamically balance local adaptation and global consistency using reinforcement learning principles.

4. To evaluate the framework's effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness in real-world streaming video analytics scenarios on heterogeneous edge devices.

### Significance
The significance of this research extends across theoretical and practical dimensions. From a theoretical perspective, our work bridges the gap between computational neuroscience and distributed machine learning, introducing biologically plausible learning rules to edge computing. This approach challenges the dominance of backpropagation and opens new avenues for investigating alternative learning paradigms.

From a practical standpoint, EdgePLAS addresses critical limitations in deploying AI systems on edge networks. By enabling truly asynchronous, localized learning with reduced communication requirements and memory footprint, our framework can significantly improve scalability, energy efficiency, and fault tolerance in edge AI applications. This breakthrough could enable sophisticated AI capabilities in scenarios where they were previously infeasible, such as autonomous vehicles, smart infrastructure, and real-time environmental monitoring systems.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 System Architecture

EdgePLAS consists of three main components: (1) a network of edge devices with heterogeneous capabilities, each running a subnetwork with local learning rules; (2) a knowledge aggregation server that periodically receives and integrates insights from edge devices; and (3) a reinforcement learning-based controller that dynamically adjusts plasticity rates based on performance metrics.

![System Architecture Diagram]

The overall flow of the system operates as follows:

1. Each edge device processes local data streams using its subnetwork
2. Learning occurs through local plasticity-based weight updates
3. Periodically, devices share compressed representations with the aggregation server
4. The server integrates these insights and broadcasts updated priors
5. The RL controller adjusts plasticity rates based on performance metrics

### 2.2 Biologically Inspired Local Learning Rules

The core innovation of EdgePLAS is replacing gradient-based backpropagation with biologically plausible local learning rules. We propose a hybrid Hebbian-STDP (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) learning rule that updates synaptic weights based on local activity patterns without requiring gradient propagation through the entire network.

For a neural unit with input activations $\mathbf{x}$ and output activation $y$, the weight update follows:

$$\Delta \mathbf{w} = \eta \cdot (H(\mathbf{x}, y) + S(\mathbf{x}, y) + R(\mathbf{x}, y))$$

where:
- $\eta$ is the plasticity rate (learning rate)
- $H(\mathbf{x}, y)$ is the Hebbian component
- $S(\mathbf{x}, y)$ is the STDP component
- $R(\mathbf{x}, y)$ is a regularization term

The Hebbian component implements the principle that "neurons that fire together, wire together":

$$H(\mathbf{x}, y) = y \cdot \mathbf{x} - \alpha \cdot y^2 \cdot \mathbf{w}$$

where $\alpha$ is a weight decay parameter that prevents unbounded weight growth.

The STDP component captures temporal relationships between pre- and post-synaptic activity:

$$S(\mathbf{x}, y) = \sum_{t'<t} A_+ \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{t-t'}{\tau_+}\right) \cdot \mathbf{x}(t') \cdot y(t) - \sum_{t'>t} A_- \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{t'-t}{\tau_-}\right) \cdot \mathbf{x}(t') \cdot y(t)$$

where:
- $A_+$ and $A_-$ are the magnitudes of potentiation and depression
- $\tau_+$ and $\tau_-$ are the temporal windows for potentiation and depression
- $t$ represents the current time step

The regularization term ensures weight stability and implements homeostatic plasticity:

$$R(\mathbf{x}, y) = \beta \cdot (c - \bar{y}) \cdot \mathbf{x}$$

where:
- $\beta$ is the regularization strength
- $c$ is the target average activation
- $\bar{y}$ is the moving average of the output activation

### 2.3 Network Architecture and Layer-wise Training

Each edge device implements a modular neural network architecture where each layer is trained using local objectives. For vision tasks, we employ a hierarchical structure:

1. **Feature Extraction Layers**: Convolutional layers with local receptive fields
2. **Representation Layers**: Self-supervised encoding layers
3. **Task-Specific Layers**: Specialized layers for classification, detection, etc.

Each layer $l$ minimizes a local loss function:

$$\mathcal{L}_l = \mathcal{L}_{recon}(\mathbf{x}_l, \hat{\mathbf{x}}_l) + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{info}(\mathbf{x}_l, \mathbf{y}_l) + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{task}(\mathbf{y}_l, \mathbf{t})$$

where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{recon}$ is a reconstruction loss ensuring the layer preserves input information
- $\mathcal{L}_{info}$ is an information maximization term promoting useful representations
- $\mathcal{L}_{task}$ is a task-specific loss (when labels $\mathbf{t}$ are available)
- $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are weighting coefficients

### 2.4 Knowledge Sharing and Aggregation

To enable collaboration while minimizing communication overhead, EdgePLAS implements a periodic knowledge sharing mechanism:

1. **Local Representation Compression**: Each device compresses its learned representations using a knowledge distillation approach:

$$\mathbf{z}_i = E_i(\mathbf{x}_i)$$

where $E_i$ is an encoder that distills the device's knowledge into a compact representation $\mathbf{z}_i$.

2. **Asynchronous Communication**: Devices communicate these compressed representations to the aggregation server at intervals determined by their capabilities and conditions:

$$\mathcal{T}_i = f(C_i, B_i, P_i)$$

where $\mathcal{T}_i$ is the communication interval for device $i$, dependent on computational capacity $C_i$, bandwidth $B_i$, and performance $P_i$.

3. **Knowledge Aggregation**: The server aggregates representations using a weighted combination based on freshness and reliability:

$$\mathbf{Z} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \cdot \mathbf{z}_i$$

where $w_i$ is the weight assigned to device $i$, calculated as:

$$w_i = \frac{\exp(-\gamma \cdot s_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(-\gamma \cdot s_j)}$$

with $s_i$ representing the staleness of device $i$'s update and $\gamma$ controlling the staleness penalty.

4. **Prior Distribution**: The server broadcasts the aggregated knowledge as a prior to guide individual device learning:

$$\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{w}) = g(\mathbf{Z})$$

where $g$ transforms the aggregated representation into a prior distribution over model weights.

### 2.5 Adaptive Plasticity Control via Reinforcement Learning

A key innovation of EdgePLAS is the dynamic adjustment of plasticity rates using reinforcement learning. This approach allows the system to balance local adaptation and global consistency based on performance feedback.

We formulate this as a Markov Decision Process:
- **State**: $s_t = [\mathbf{p}_t, \mathbf{m}_t, \mathbf{c}_t]$, where $\mathbf{p}_t$ represents performance metrics, $\mathbf{m}_t$ represents model state, and $\mathbf{c}_t$ represents communication statistics
- **Action**: $a_t = \eta_t$, the plasticity rate
- **Reward**: $r_t = \alpha_1 P_t - \alpha_2 C_t - \alpha_3 D_t$, where $P_t$ is performance, $C_t$ is communication cost, and $D_t$ is divergence from the global model
- **Transition**: $s_{t+1} = h(s_t, a_t)$, determined by the learning dynamics

We employ a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to learn an optimal policy $\pi(a|s)$ that maximizes the expected cumulative reward:

$$J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t r_t\right]$$

where $\theta$ represents the policy parameters and $\gamma$ is a discount factor.
