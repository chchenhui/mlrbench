# Edge-Localized Asynchronous Learning with Biologically Inspired Plasticity

## 1. Introduction  
**Background**  
Modern machine learning relies heavily on global end-to-end training through backpropagation, which suffers from critical limitations in distributed and resource-constrained environments. Centralized synchronization incurs prohibitive communication overhead, while memory-intensive operations hinder deployment on edge devices with limited computational resources. Furthermore, the biological implausibility of backpropagation—a process requiring non-local gradient computations—motivates the exploration of alternative learning paradigms.  

Localized learning, inspired by synaptic plasticity mechanisms in biological neural systems, offers a promising alternative. By enabling asynchronous, decentralized updates based on local objectives, such methods avoid synchronization bottlenecks and reduce hardware constraints. Recent studies in federated learning (AEDFL [1], DRACO [2]) and biologically plausible rules (STDP [5,10]) highlight progress, but challenges remain in balancing communication efficiency, model consistency, and resource heterogeneity.  

**Research Objectives**  
This work aims to:  
1. Design a fully asynchronous, edge-localized learning framework using hybrid Hebbian-STDP rules that eliminate global gradient synchronization.  
2. Develop adaptive plasticity rate control via reinforcement learning to manage staleness and device heterogeneity.  
3. Validate the framework’s ability to achieve real-time inference on streaming video tasks while reducing communication overhead by 30–50% compared to federated baselines.  

**Significance**  
If successful, this approach will enable scalable learning on unreliable edge networks (e.g., autonomous drones, smart sensors) with minimal dependency on centralized infrastructure. By combining neurobiological principles with modern edge computing constraints, the work bridges a critical gap in adaptive, real-time AI systems.

## 2. Methodology  
### 2.1 System Architecture  
The proposed framework consists of **edge devices** training decentralized subnetworks and a **central server** for periodic knowledge aggregation:  
1. **Edge Devices**: Each device trains a lightweight spiking neural network (SNN) using local data streams. Weight updates follow hybrid Hebbian-STDP rules computed from spiking activity.  
2. **Aggregation Server**: Receives compressed latent representations from devices, distills them into global priors, and broadcasts updated priors using dynamic importance weighting.  

### 2.2 Local Learning Rules  
**Hybrid Hebbian-STDP Update**  
For a synapse connecting neuron $i$ (pre-synaptic) and $j$ (post-synaptic), the weight $w_{ij}$ is updated as:  
$$
\Delta w_{ij} = \eta \left[ \alpha \cdot \text{STDP}(t_i, t_j) + (1 - \alpha) \cdot x_i x_j \right] - \beta w_{ij}
$$  
where:  
- $\eta$ is the learning rate, $\alpha$ balances STDP and Hebbian terms, and $\beta$ is a decay factor.  
- $\text{STDP}(t_i, t_j)$ follows a temporal dependency:  
  $$
  \text{STDP}(t_i, t_j) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  e^{-\frac{|t_i - t_j|}{\tau_+}} & \text{if } t_i \leq t_j \\
  -e^{-\frac{|t_i - t_j|}{\tau_-}} & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$  
  with time constants $\tau_+$, $\tau_-$ controlling potentiation and depression windows.  

**Reinforcement Learning for Plasticity Rates**  
A lightweight policy network on each device adjusts $\eta$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ to maximize a reward $R$ balancing local accuracy ($A$), staleness ($S$), and energy cost ($E$):  
$$
R = \lambda_1 A - \lambda_2 S - \lambda_3 E
$$  
The policy is trained via proximal policy optimization (PPO), with gradients estimated as:  
$$
\nabla J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[ \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) \cdot (R - V(s)) \right]
$$  
where $V(s)$ is a value function approximator.  

### 2.3 Knowledge Distillation and Aggregation  
1. **Compressed Representation**: Edge devices extract latent features $z = f_\phi(x)$ and transmit them to the server. Transmission frequency is governed by an entropy threshold $H(z) > \gamma$.  
2. **Distillation Loss**: The server trains a global prior $g_\psi$ to minimize:  
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}} = \mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{Z}} \left[ \text{KL}(g_\psi(z) \, \| \, \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^N f_{\phi_k}(z)) \right]
   $$  
3. **Dynamic Weighting**: Devices receive $g_\psi$ with a staleness-aware weight $\omega_k = \exp(-\mu \Delta t_k)$, where $\Delta t_k$ is the time since their last update.  

### 2.4 Experimental Design  
**Datasets & Tasks**  
- **Streaming Video Analytics**: Evaluate on the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, simulating a real-time action recognition pipeline with 50 ms latency constraints.  
- **Network Simulation**: Emulate unreliable edge networks with devices varying in compute (1–4 TFLOPS), bandwidth (10–100 Mbps), and failure rates (0–20% downtime).
