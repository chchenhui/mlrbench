Edge-Localized Asynchronous Learning with Biologically Inspired Plasticity

## 2. Introduction

### Background

Edge computing networks are becoming increasingly important due to their ability to process data locally, reducing latency and bandwidth usage. However, traditional global end-to-end learning methods face several challenges when applied to edge computing. These include centralized computation requirements, high memory footprint, synchronization costs, and latency issues. Biological neural networks, on the other hand, learn through local, asynchronous synaptic updates, making them a promising alternative for edge computing.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop an asynchronous, decentralized training framework for edge devices that replaces global backpropagation with biologically plausible local learning rules. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Replace global backpropagation with biologically inspired local learning rules, such as Hebbian and STDP.
2. Design a hybrid Hebbian-STDP rule that updates weights based on local pre/post-synaptic activity without gradient propagation.
3. Develop a dynamic plasticity rate adjustment mechanism using reinforcement learning to balance local adaptation and global consistency.
4. Evaluate the proposed framework on streaming video analytics tasks, comparing accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency against synchronized baselines.

### Significance

This research is significant because it addresses the key limitations of global end-to-end learning in edge computing networks. By leveraging biologically inspired local learning rules, the proposed framework can enable scalable, adaptive edge AI for applications such as autonomous systems and streaming analytics. Furthermore, the framework's ability to operate in a decentralized, asynchronous manner can improve robustness to device failure and reduce communication overhead.

## 3. Methodology

### Research Design

The proposed research will follow a systematic approach to develop and evaluate the Edge-Localized Asynchronous Learning framework. The methodology consists of the following steps:

1. **Biologically Inspired Learning Rule Design**: Develop a hybrid Hebbian-STDP rule that updates weights based on local pre/post-synaptic activity without gradient propagation.
2. **Dynamic Plasticity Rate Adjustment**: Implement a reinforcement learning-based mechanism to dynamically adjust plasticity rates, balancing local adaptation and global consistency.
3. **Knowledge Distillation**: Develop a method for devices to share compressed representations (e.g., via knowledge distillation) with a central server, which aggregates and broadcasts updated priors.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the proposed framework on streaming video analytics tasks, comparing accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency against synchronized baselines.

### Data Collection

The data for evaluation will consist of streaming video analytics datasets, such as the Kinetics dataset or the HumanEva dataset. These datasets will be used to train and test the proposed framework on various edge devices.

### Algorithmic Steps and Mathematical Formulas

#### Hybrid Hebbian-STDP Rule

The hybrid Hebbian-STDP rule updates weights based on local pre/post-synaptic activity. The weight update can be represented as:

\[ \Delta w_{ij} = \eta \left[ \alpha \frac{\partial y_i}{\partial w_{ij}} + \beta \frac{\partial y_j}{\partial w_{ij}} \right] \]

where \( \eta \) is the learning rate, \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are scaling factors, and \( \frac{\partial y_i}{\partial w_{ij}} \) and \( \frac{\partial y_j}{\partial w_{ij}} \) are the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic activity, respectively.

#### Dynamic Plasticity Rate Adjustment

The dynamic plasticity rate adjustment mechanism uses reinforcement learning to balance local adaptation and global consistency. The plasticity rate \( \eta \) can be updated based on the reward signal:

\[ \eta_{t+1} = \eta_{t} + \alpha \left[ r_{t} - \eta_{t} \right] \]

where \( \alpha \) is the learning rate for the plasticity adjustment, and \( r_{t} \) is the reward signal at time \( t \).

#### Knowledge Distillation

Devices share compressed representations with a central server using knowledge distillation. The compressed representation can be obtained by applying a temperature scaling factor \( T \) to the softmax output of the network:

\[ \hat{y}_i = \frac{\exp(z_i / T)}{\sum_j \exp(z_j / T)} \]

where \( z_i \) is the logit output of the network, and \( \hat{y}_i \) is the compressed representation.

### Experimental Design

The experimental design will involve training the proposed framework on streaming video analytics tasks using various edge devices. The evaluation metrics will include:

1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions made by the model.
2. **Latency**: The time taken for the model to make a prediction.
3. **Energy Efficiency**: The amount of energy consumed by the model during training and inference.

The framework will be compared against synchronized baselines, such as global end-to-end learning and other decentralized learning methods.

### Expected Outcomes

The expected outcomes of this research include:

1. **Reduced Communication Overhead**: The proposed framework is expected to reduce communication overhead by 30â€“50% compared to synchronized baselines.

3. **Real-Time Performance**: The framework is expected to achieve real-time performance on edge hardware, making it suitable for streaming video analytics applications.
4. **Biologically Plausible Learning**: The implementation of biologically inspired local learning rules is expected to provide a more biologically plausible learning mechanism.

This research is expected to have a significant impact on the field of edge computing and distributed learning. The proposed framework could redefine scalable, bio-inspired learning for distributed systems, enabling more efficient and adaptive edge AI for a wide range of applications. Furthermore, the research could contribute to the development of new biologically inspired learning rules and techniques for edge computing.
