**Title:** Edge-Localized Asynchronous Learning with Biologically Inspired Plasticity  

**Motivation:**  
Edge computing networks demand efficient, real-time learning on resource-constrained, unreliable devices. Global backpropagation is infeasible due to synchronization costs, memory demands, and latency. Biological neural networks, however, learn via local, asynchronous synaptic updates. Bridging this gap could enable scalable, adaptive edge AI for applications like autonomous systems and streaming analytics.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose an asynchronous, decentralized training framework for edge devices that replaces global backpropagation with biologically plausible local learning rules. Each device trains a subnetwork using a hybrid Hebbian-STDP (spike-timing-dependent plasticity) rule, which updates weights based on local pre/post-synaptic activity without gradient propagation. Devices periodically share compressed representations (e.g., via knowledge distillation) to a central server, which aggregates and broadcasts updated priors. To address staleness and heterogeneity, we introduce dynamic plasticity rates adjusted via reinforcement learning, balancing local adaptation and global consistency. We evaluate on streaming video analytics tasks, comparing accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency against synchronized baselines. Expected outcomes include a 30â€“50% reduction in communication overhead, improved robustness to device failure, and real-time performance on edge hardware. This work could redefine scalable, bio-inspired learning for distributed systems.
