**Dynamic Resource-Aware Adaptive Data Preprocessing for Scalable Neural Network Training**  

---

### 1. Introduction  

#### Background  
The rapid growth of neural network scale—exemplified by large language models (LLMs), vision transformers, and generative AI—has intensified the computational demands of training. Despite advancements in hardware and distributed computing, data preprocessing and loading remain critical bottlenecks. Current pipelines often employ static configurations that fail to adapt to fluctuating resource availability (e.g., CPU-GPU utilization imbalances), resulting in idle hardware, prolonged training times, and energy waste. This inefficiency disproportionately impacts smaller research teams and applications in domains like healthcare or climate science, where resources are constrained.  

#### Research Objectives  
This project aims to address these challenges by designing a **dynamic, resource-aware data preprocessing system** that optimizes input pipeline efficiency across heterogeneous hardware setups. Key objectives include:  
1. Developing a lightweight **reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduler** to dynamically allocate preprocessing tasks (e.g., augmentation, tokenization) to CPU/GPU resources based on real-time telemetry.  
2. Integrating **adaptive data compression** (e.g., learned neural codecs) to reduce I/O latency while preserving data fidelity.  
3. Designing **prioritized prefetching** mechanisms to align data preparation with batch requirements.  
4. Creating a **plug-and-play library** compatible with PyTorch/TensorFlow for seamless adoption.  

#### Significance  
By decoupling preprocessing from model execution and dynamically balancing workloads, this system will reduce data loading latency by 30–50%, lower energy consumption, and democratize efficient training for resource-constrained teams. The outcomes will directly address scalability challenges in domains requiring large-scale data processing, such as AI for healthcare and climate modeling.

### 2. Methodology  

#### System Overview  
The proposed system comprises four interconnected modules (Fig. 1):  
1. **Hardware Telemetry Monitor**: Collects real-time metrics (CPU/GPU utilization, memory, storage bandwidth).  
2. **Resource-Aware Scheduler**: RL agent that assigns preprocessing tasks to hardware resources.  
3. **Adaptive Preprocessing Engine**: Implements compression, augmentation, and tokenization with learned codecs.  
4. **Prioritized Prefetching Manager**: Predicts batch demand to prioritize data loading.

#### Component Details  

**A. Hardware Telemetry Monitor**  
- **Metrics Tracked**: GPU memory utilization (%) $m_g$, CPU cores idle (%) $c_i$, disk read speed (MB/s) $s_d$, network bandwidth (Gbps) $b_n$.  
- **State Representation**: At time $t$, the state $S_t$ is a vector:  
  $$S_t = [m_g, c_i, s_d, b_n, \text{queue\_length}]$$  

**B. Reinforcement Learning-Based Scheduler**  
- **Markov Decision Process (MDP) Formulation**:  
  - **State Space**: $S_t$ (hardware telemetry + preprocessing queue status).  
  - **Action Space**: Assign task $k$ to CPU ($a=0$) or GPU ($a=1$).  
  - **Reward Function**: Minimize latency while balancing resource use:  
    $$  
    R_t = \alpha \cdot (1 - \text{latency}_t) + \beta \cdot \left(1 - |u_c - u_g|\right) - \gamma \cdot \text{overflow\_penalty}  
    $$  
    where $u_c$ and $u_g$ are CPU/GPU utilization, $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are tunable weights.  
- **Algorithm**: A Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) trains the scheduler using prioritized experience replay to handle sparse rewards.  

**C. Adaptive Data Compression**  
- **Learned Codec Architecture**: An autoencoder compresses data batches $x$ via encoder $f_\theta$ and decoder $g_\phi$. The loss function balances reconstruction quality and compression speed:  
  $$  
  \mathcal{L} = \|x - g_\phi(f_\theta(x))\|^2 + \lambda \cdot \text{size}(f_\theta(x))  
  $$  
- **Adaptation Strategy**: A controller dynamically selects compression levels (e.g., 8-bit vs. 16-bit) based on current GPU memory pressure.  

**D. Prioritized Prefetching**  
- **Scoring Function**: For each batch $i$, compute priority score $s_i$:  
  $$  
  s_i = \frac{\exp(z_i)}{\sum_j \exp(z_j)}, \quad z_i = \text{MLP}(h_{i-1}, \Delta t)  
  $$  
  where $h_{i-1}$ is the hidden state of a recurrent network predicting batch demand.  

**E. Integration with DL Frameworks**  
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow Compatibility**: Implement custom iterators that wrap native DataLoader APIs, intercept preprocessing calls, and route tasks via the scheduler.

  2. NVIDIA DALI (optimized GPU preprocessing)  
  3. Static pipeline with manual CPU/GPU partitioning

4. **Compression Efficiency**: Ratio of original-to-compressed size vs. reconstruction error (PSNR/SSIM).  
5. **Energy Consumption**: Watts/hour (measured via hardware APIs).  

**Validation Protocol**  
1. **A/B Testing**: Compare end-to-end training time for ResNet-152 on ImageNet under fixed vs. dynamic preprocessing.  
2. **Resource-Constrained Simulation**: Limit CPU cores/GPU memory to mimic under-resourced environments.  
3. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Evaluate on NLP (BERT on C4) and climate models (U-Net on ClimateNet).
