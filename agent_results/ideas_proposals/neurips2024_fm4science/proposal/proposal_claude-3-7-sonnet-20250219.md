# BaySciUQ: A Bayesian Framework for Uncertainty Quantification in Scientific Foundation Models

## 1. Introduction

### Background
The emergence of foundation models has revolutionized artificial intelligence across multiple domains, demonstrating unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing, computer vision, and increasingly, scientific applications. These models, trained on vast and diverse datasets, provide versatile pre-trained bases that can be adapted to various tasks. As foundation models begin to penetrate scientific domains, from astrophysics to biomedicine, materials science to quantum mechanics, they promise to accelerate discovery and transform scientific methodology.

However, a critical gap exists in the application of foundation models to scientific problems: reliable uncertainty quantification. Unlike traditional AI applications where errors might lead to inconvenience, scientific applications often involve high-stakes decisions where the reliability of predictions is paramount. Scientists need to know not merely what a model predicts, but how confident that prediction is and whether it should be trusted. Current foundation models excel at producing answers but often fail to provide reliable uncertainty estimates, leading to potentially misleading conclusions when applied to scientific problems that require rigorous validation.

The scientific method fundamentally relies on understanding the limits of knowledge and quantifying uncertainty in measurements and predictions. As foundation models become increasingly integrated into the scientific workflow, bridging this gap becomes essential. Recent works have begun addressing uncertainty quantification in scientific machine learning (Psaros et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2023), but these approaches have not been specifically designed for or scaled to the complexity of foundation models in scientific applications.

### Research Objectives
This research proposal aims to develop BaySciUQ, a comprehensive Bayesian framework specifically designed for quantifying uncertainty in scientific foundation models. The objectives are:

1. To develop scalable Bayesian inference techniques that can be applied to large foundation models used in scientific applications, providing principled uncertainty estimates.

2. To create methods for incorporating domain-specific scientific knowledge as Bayesian priors, ensuring that uncertainty estimates respect fundamental scientific constraints.

3. To establish calibration metrics and evaluation methodologies specifically designed for assessing uncertainty in scientific predictions.

4. To design interpretable visualization tools that enable scientists without machine learning expertise to understand and utilize uncertainty estimates in their research.

5. To validate the framework across multiple scientific domains, demonstrating its versatility and reliability in real-world scientific applications.

### Significance
The significance of this research lies in its potential to bridge the gap between the powerful capabilities of foundation models and the rigorous uncertainty quantification required in scientific discovery. By providing reliable uncertainty estimates, BaySciUQ will:

- Enable scientists to appropriately weight model predictions in their work, distinguishing between confident predictions and those requiring further investigation.
- Improve the trustworthiness of AI systems in scientific domains, facilitating their integration into established scientific workflows.
- Allow for the identification of knowledge gaps where models are highly uncertain, potentially guiding future data collection and research efforts.
- Enhance scientific reproducibility by explicitly accounting for model uncertainty alongside experimental uncertainty.
- Accelerate scientific discovery by providing a principled framework for integrating foundation model predictions with traditional scientific methods.

This research directly addresses a key challenge identified in the foundation models for science community: "How to quantify the scientific uncertainty of foundation models?" By developing a comprehensive solution to this challenge, BaySciUQ will contribute to the responsible and effective application of foundation models across scientific domains.

## 2. Methodology

The proposed methodology for BaySciUQ consists of four core components: (1) scalable Bayesian inference for foundation models, (2) integration of scientific knowledge as Bayesian priors, (3) calibration and evaluation of uncertainty estimates, and (4) visualization and interpretation tools. Each component is detailed below.

### 2.1 Scalable Bayesian Inference for Foundation Models

We propose a variational inference approach that scales to the size of foundation models. For a foundation model parameterized by weights $\theta$, we seek to approximate the posterior distribution $p(\theta|D)$ given training data $D$, which allows us to quantify weight uncertainty.

The key challenge is scaleâ€”foundation models often contain billions of parameters, making traditional Bayesian methods computationally infeasible. We address this through:

1. **Matrix-Variate Gaussian Approximations**: Instead of modeling the full covariance matrix of weights, we will use matrix-variate Gaussian distributions to capture parameter correlations efficiently:

$$q(\theta) = \mathcal{MN}(\mathbf{M}, \mathbf{U}, \mathbf{V})$$

where $\mathbf{M}$ is the mean matrix, and $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are row and column covariance matrices. This reduces the number of parameters from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of model parameters.

2. **Rank-Constrained Approximations**: We further reduce computational complexity by using low-rank approximations for the covariance structures:

$$\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{D}_U + \mathbf{P}_U\mathbf{P}_U^T, \quad \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{D}_V + \mathbf{P}_V\mathbf{P}_V^T$$

where $\mathbf{D}_U$ and $\mathbf{D}_V$ are diagonal matrices, and $\mathbf{P}_U$ and $\mathbf{P}_V$ are low-rank factors.

3. **Stochastic Variational Inference**: We optimize the variational parameters using stochastic gradient estimates of the evidence lower bound (ELBO):

$$\mathcal{L}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\theta)} [\log p(D|\theta)] - \text{KL}[q_\phi(\theta) || p(\theta)]$$

where $\phi$ represents the variational parameters.

4. **Layer-wise Uncertainty Quantification**: For extremely large models, we will implement layer-wise uncertainty quantification, focusing computational resources on layers that contribute most to predictive uncertainty.

5. **Monte Carlo Dropout as Approximate Bayesian Inference**: For even larger models where full Bayesian treatment remains intractable, we will implement MC dropout with calibrated dropout rates that approximate Bayesian inference:

$$p(y|x, D) \approx \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T p(y|x, \hat{\theta}_t)$$

where $\hat{\theta}_t$ represents parameters with dropout applied.

### 2.2 Integration of Scientific Knowledge as Bayesian Priors

A key innovation of BaySciUQ is the incorporation of scientific domain knowledge into the Bayesian framework through carefully designed priors. We propose:

1. **Physics-Informed Priors**: For models dealing with physical systems, we design priors that encode physical laws. For instance, in fluid dynamics applications, we might use priors that favor weight configurations that satisfy conservation laws:

$$p(\theta) \propto \exp\left(-\lambda \int_\Omega \left\| \mathcal{P}[f_\theta](x) \right\|^2 dx\right)$$

where $\mathcal{P}$ is a differential operator representing physical constraints, and $f_\theta$ is the model with parameters $\theta$.

2. **Structure-Preserving Priors**: For domains like molecular modeling or materials science, we develop priors that respect the structural properties of the systems being modeled:

$$p(\theta) \propto \exp\left(-\sum_i \alpha_i \Phi_i(\theta)\right)$$

where $\Phi_i$ are potential functions encoding structural constraints, and $\alpha_i$ are strength parameters.

3. **Multi-Fidelity Priors**: We incorporate information from different fidelity sources, including theoretical models, simulations, and experimental data:

$$p(\theta) = \int p(\theta|\eta)p(\eta|D_{\text{low}}, D_{\text{high}})d\eta$$

where $\eta$ represents latent variables linking different fidelity levels, and $D_{\text{low}}$ and $D_{\text{high}}$ represent low and high fidelity data.

4. **Expert-Elicited Priors**: For domains where formal mathematical constraints are difficult to specify, we develop methods to elicit priors from domain experts:

$$p(\theta) = \int p(\theta|z)p(z|\mathcal{E})dz$$

where $z$ represents latent variables and $\mathcal{E}$ represents expert knowledge.

### 2.3 Calibration and Evaluation of Uncertainty Estimates

We will develop rigorous methods to evaluate and calibrate uncertainty estimates for scientific applications:

1. **Domain-Specific Calibration**: We propose calibration metrics tailored to specific scientific domains. For example, in chemical property prediction, we might use:

$$\text{ECE}_{\text{chem}} = \sum_{m=1}^M \frac{|B_m|}{n} \left| \text{acc}(B_m) - \text{conf}(B_m) \right| \cdot w(\text{imp}_m)$$

where $B_m$ are bins of predictions, $\text{acc}(B_m)$ and $\text{conf}(B_m)$ are accuracy and confidence in bin $m$, and $w(\text{imp}_m)$ weights bins by their importance in the chemical context.

2. **Credible Interval Coverage**: For regression tasks, we evaluate whether predicted credible intervals achieve their expected coverage:

$$\text{Coverage}(\alpha) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}[y_i \in \text{CI}_\alpha(x_i)]$$

where $\text{CI}_\alpha(x_i)$ is the $\alpha$-level credible interval for input $x_i$.

3. **Adversarial Uncertainty Evaluation**: We develop adversarial testing procedures to identify cases where the model might be confidently wrong:

$$\max_{x' \in \mathcal{B}(x, \epsilon)} \left\{\text{confidence}(x') - \text{accuracy}(x')\right\}$$

where $\mathcal{B}(x, \epsilon)$ represents a neighborhood around input $x$.

4. **Out-of-Distribution Detection**: We evaluate the model's ability to recognize inputs that fall outside its domain of applicability:

$$\text{AUROC}_{\text{OOD}} = \text{AUROC}(\{\text{uncertainty}(x_i)\}_{i \in \text{in-dist}}, \{\text{uncertainty}(x_j)\}_{j \in \text{OOD}})$$

5. **Posterior Predictive Checks**: We implement scientific consistency checks based on posterior predictive distributions:

$$p(y_{\text{check}}|x_{\text{check}}, D) = \int p(y_{\text{check}}|x_{\text{check}}, \theta)p(\theta|D)d\theta$$

### 2.4 Visualization and Interpretation Tools

We will develop visualization tools to help scientists interpret uncertainty estimates:

1. **Uncertainty Decomposition Visualizations**: Tools to visualize the different sources of uncertainty (e.g., parameter uncertainty, data uncertainty, model misspecification):

$$\text{Var}[y|x, D] = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{\theta|D}[\text{Var}[y|x, \theta]]}_{\text{Aleatoric}} + \underbrace{\text{Var}_{\theta|D}[\mathbb{E}[y|x, \theta]]}_{\text{Epistemic}}$$

2. **Sensitivity Maps**: Visualizations that show which input features contribute most to uncertainty:

$$S_i(x) = \frac{\partial \text{Var}[y|x, D]}{\partial x_i}$$

3. **Uncertainty Propagation Diagrams**: For multi-step predictions, tools to visualize how uncertainty propagates through the prediction pipeline.

4. **Comparison with Experimental Uncertainty**: Tools to compare model uncertainty with experimental uncertainty, helping scientists contextualize model predictions.

5. **Interactive Exploration**: Development of interactive dashboards that allow scientists to explore model predictions and associated uncertainties across parameter spaces relevant to their domain.

### 2.5 Experimental Design and Validation

To validate BaySciUQ, we will conduct experiments across multiple scientific domains:

1. **Materials Science**: Predicting material properties with uncertainty quantification, validated against experimental measurements. We will use the Materials Project dataset, containing DFT-calculated properties for over 130,000 inorganic compounds.

2. **Molecular Modeling**: Predicting molecular properties and interactions with uncertainty estimates, using the QM9 dataset with 134,000 molecules.

3. **Climate Science**: Quantifying uncertainty in climate predictions, using historical climate data and evaluating against held-out test regions.

4. **Protein Structure Prediction**: Estimating uncertainty in predicted protein structures, using the CASP dataset for validation.

For each domain, we will evaluate against the following metrics:

- **Predictive Performance**: RMSE, MAE, RÂ² for regression tasks; Accuracy, F1-score for classification tasks.
- **Uncertainty Quality**: Calibration error, proper scoring rules (e.g., negative log-likelihood, continuous ranked probability score), sharpness metrics.
- **Out-of-Distribution Detection**: AUROC, AUPR for detecting samples outside the training distribution.
- **Computational Efficiency**: Training time, inference time, memory requirements.
- **User Studies**: Qualitative evaluation of visualization tools with domain scientists.

We will compare BaySciUQ against:
- Non-Bayesian foundation models with heuristic uncertainty estimates
- Ensemble methods (Deep Ensembles)
- Existing Bayesian approaches (when scalable to the problem)
- Domain-specific uncertainty quantification methods
