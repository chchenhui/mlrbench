# Adaptive KV Cache Pruning for Long Context Understanding

## Motivation
As language models handle increasingly lengthy contexts, the KV cache grows linearly with sequence length, creating severe memory bottlenecks during inference. This problem is particularly acute in applications requiring real-time processing of long documents, streaming data, or extended conversations. Current approaches sacrifice either context length or model performance, forcing unacceptable trade-offs in production environments. An efficient solution for KV cache management is critical for making long-context understanding practical in resource-constrained settings.

## Main Idea
I propose a dynamic KV cache pruning framework that adaptively determines which key-value pairs to retain based on their contextual importance. The system employs a lightweight "importance predictor" network that runs in parallel with the main model to score each token's relevance to the current generation task. This predictor learns from attention patterns across layers to identify tokens that can be safely discarded without compromising output quality. The framework implements a hierarchical caching strategy where the most important tokens remain in GPU memory, moderately important tokens are stored in CPU memory for potential retrieval, and low-importance tokens are discarded entirely. This approach maintains the full expressiveness of transformer architectures while dramatically reducing memory requirements, enabling practical deployment of long-context models on standard hardware with minimal performance degradation.
