1. Title  
Dynamic Context Windows for Efficient Instruction Following over Long Documents  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Recent breakthroughs in instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Bard have dramatically improved their ability to interpret and execute open-ended language commands. By fine-tuning on massive instruction–response pairs and leveraging human feedback, these models can follow complex, multi‐step instructions across diverse domains. However, when instructions refer to very long documents (e.g., legal contracts, scientific articles, technical manuals), standard self‐attention mechanisms incur quadratically growing compute and memory costs, and performance often degrades due to diluted attention over irrelevant context.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a novel “Dynamic Context Windows” (DCW) framework that:  
  • Automatically segments a long document into hierarchical relevance zones based on instruction semantics.  
  • Allocates denser attention to critical segments and sparser attention elsewhere via a two‐phase lightweight classifier + fine‐tuned LLM architecture.  
  • Demonstrates both improved end-task performance (e.g., summarization, question answering, analysis) and substantial compute savings over uniform full‐context processing.  

Significance  
By strategically focusing model capacity on instruction‐relevant text while preserving connectivity to the remaining context, DCW promises to:  
  • Enable LLMs to process documents of length >100k tokens at practical cost.  
  • Improve accuracy on long-document tasks by up to 5–10% relative to existing sparse‐attention methods (e.g., LongLoRA, BigBird).  
  • Facilitate new applications in legal analysis, multi‐document summarization, and scientific literature review where maintaining large context is crucial.  
  • Contribute open-source tools and datasets to the community for reproducible research in long-text instruction following.  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Overview  
DCW comprises two primary modules:  
  1. Context Relevance Classifier (CRC): a lightweight encoder that predicts a relevance score for each text segment given the instruction.  
  2. Dynamic‐Attention LLM (DA‐LLM): an instruction-tuned transformer model whose attention patterns adapt per segment based on the CRC scores.  

3.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
  • Instruction–Document Pairs: Curate and combine existing benchmarks:  
    – GovReport (legal summaries)  
    – Qasper (question answering over scientific papers)  
    – MultiDoc2Dial (multi‐document dialogue)  
  • Synthetic Long-Text Dataset: Generate documents up to 100k tokens by concatenating related scientific abstracts or legal sections with simulated instructions (e.g., “Summarize the main argument of Section 3”).  
  • Segmentation: Split documents into non‐overlapping segments of fixed length $L_s$ (e.g., 512 tokens).  

3.3 Context Relevance Classifier (CRC)  
  • Architecture: A lightweight BERT‐style encoder that takes as input  
    – Instruction embedding $h_{\mathrm{inst}} \in \mathbb{R}^d$  
    – Segment embedding $h_{\mathrm{seg}}^i \in \mathbb{R}^d$  
  • Relevance Score Computation:  
    $$ r_i = \sigma\bigl(W_r[h_{\mathrm{inst}}; h_{\mathrm{seg}}^i] + b_r\bigr), $$  
    where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid activation, and $[\cdot;\cdot]$ denotes concatenation.  
  • Training Objective: Binary cross‐entropy on human‐annotated relevance labels or silver labels derived via exact‐match heuristics.  

3.4 Dynamic Attention Mechanism  
  • For each token position $p$ in segment $i$ and token position $q$ in segment $j$, define an attention‐mask scalar $M_{ij}$:  
    $$  
      M_{ij} =  
      \begin{cases}  
        1, & \text{if } r_j \ge \tau_{\mathrm{high}} \\  
        \alpha, & \text{if } \tau_{\mathrm{low}} \le r_j < \tau_{\mathrm{high}} \\  
        \beta, & \text{otherwise}  
      \end{cases}  
    $$  
    with $1 \ge \alpha > \beta \ge 0$ and thresholds $\tau_{\mathrm{high}},\tau_{\mathrm{low}}$.  
  • Attention Computation in DA‐LLM: Modify the standard scaled dot‐product attention:  
    $$  
      \mathrm{Attn}(Q,K,V) = \mathrm{softmax}\Bigl(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} + \log M\Bigr)V,  
    $$  
    where $M$ is the block‐wise matrix with entries $M_{ij}$.  

3.5 Model Architecture and Fine‐Tuning  
  • Base LLM: Llama2‐7B or similar pre‐trained transformer.  
  • LoRA Adapters: Employ Low‐Rank Adaptation to fine‐tune only a small subset of parameters, reducing GPU memory footprint.  
  • Joint Training: Alternate between:  
    1. CRC training step (update $W_r,b_r$) on relevance labels.  
    2. DA‐LLM fine‐tuning step (update LoRA adapters) on instruction-response pairs using the DCW attention masks.  
  • Loss Function for DA‐LLM: Standard next‐token prediction cross‐entropy.  

3.6 Algorithmic Steps (Pseudocode)  
  1. Input: Document $\mathcal{D}$, Instruction $\mathcal{I}$.  
  2. Segment $\mathcal{D}$ into $\{S_1,\dots, S_N\}$.  
  3. Compute $h_{\mathrm{inst}} \leftarrow \mathrm{InstEncoder}(\mathcal{I})$.  
  4. For each $i\in\{1..N\}$:  
       a. $h_{\mathrm{seg}}^i \leftarrow \mathrm{SegEncoder}(S_i)$.  
       b. Compute relevance $r_i$.  
  5. Build attention mask matrix $M$ via the $M_{ij}$ formula.  
  6. Feed tokens through DA‐LLM with mask $M$, generate output.

  • New Applications: Enables legal tech firms to automate contract review, research labs to conduct large‐scale literature surveys, and education platforms to generate comprehensive study guides over textbook-length materials.  
  • Safety & Oversight: By isolating the relevance classifier, it is easier to audit which document segments the model focuses on, improving interpretability and guardrail enforcement.  
  • Community Contribution: Open-source release of DCW modules and benchmarks will foster further research on dynamic attention and instruction following in ultra-long contexts.
