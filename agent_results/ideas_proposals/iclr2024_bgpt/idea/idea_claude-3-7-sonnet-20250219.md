# Understanding Implicit Bias in Gradient-Based Optimizers for Deep Learning

## Motivation
Despite extensive empirical successes, we lack a comprehensive theoretical understanding of why gradient-based optimizers find solutions that generalize well in overparameterized deep neural networks. Classical learning theory predicts that overparameterized models should overfit, yet they often generalize remarkably well in practice. This discrepancy suggests that optimizers exhibit an implicit bias toward specific types of solutions. Understanding this bias is crucial for designing more efficient training algorithms and predicting generalization performance without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

## Main Idea
I propose a framework for characterizing the implicit bias of gradient-based optimizers by analyzing the trajectory of parameters in weight space during training. The key insight is to decompose the parameter space into functionally relevant subspaces using techniques from information geometry and dynamical systems theory. By tracking how different optimizers (SGD, Adam, etc.) navigate these subspaces, we can identify which solution characteristics each optimizer implicitly favors. Our approach will connect these trajectories to generalization metrics and empirically test the predictions across various architectures and datasets. The expected outcome is a predictive theory of which optimizer is most suitable for specific model-data combinations, based on the alignment between the optimizer's implicit bias and the problem structure, potentially revolutionizing how we select optimization strategies for deep learning.
