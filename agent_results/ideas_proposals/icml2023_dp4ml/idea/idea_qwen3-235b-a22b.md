**Title**: *Lagrange Interpretation for Deep Learning: Sensitivity Analysis via Duality in Model Explanation*  

**Motivation**:  
Model explanations are critical for ensuring trustworthy and debuggable AI systems, yet existing methods often lack formal guarantees or principled sensitivity measures. Lagrange duality, which quantifies how constraints affect optimal solutions, offers a mathematically rigorous pathway to identify input features that most strongly influence model predictions. Leveraging this underexplored duality principle in nonconvex deep learning could bridge the gap between empirical model behavior and interpretable, sensitivity-grounded explanations.  

**Main Idea**:  
We propose a framework that reformulates a neural network’s prediction task as a constrained optimization problem, where constraints encode prior knowledge (e.g., feature thresholds). By solving the Lagrange dual problem, we obtain dual variables (multipliers) that measure the sensitivity of the prediction to each constraint. These sensitivity scores—interpretable as the marginal impact of relaxing a constraint—are then propagated back to input features to generate instance-specific explanations. Methodologically, we (1) design convex constraints aligned with network layers (e.g., activation bounds), (2) derive dual variables via implicit differentiation of the optimization problem, and (3) aggregate multipliers into importance maps (e.g., for image saliency or tabular feature attribution). Expected outcomes include a duality-based explanation framework that is both theoretically grounded (via formal sensitivity guarantees) and practical (scalable to large models). This approach could advance model interpretation by explicitly connecting input perturbations to prediction stability, with applications in fairness audits, adversarial robustness, and robust decision-making systems.
