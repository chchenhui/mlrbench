### Title: "Temporal Convolutional Networks for High-Resolution Tactile Data Processing"

### Motivation:
The advancement of high-resolution tactile sensors has significantly increased the volume of data available for processing. However, traditional neural network models struggle to effectively handle the unique temporal and spatial characteristics of tactile data. This research aims to bridge this gap by developing a novel computational approach that can process high-resolution tactile data efficiently and accurately.

### Main Idea:
We propose the use of Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for the processing of high-resolution tactile data. TCNs, known for their ability to handle sequential data, are particularly suitable for touch sensing due to its temporal and local nature. Our approach involves designing a TCN architecture that can capture both the temporal dynamics and the spatial features of tactile data. The network will consist of multiple layers of temporal convolutions, followed by spatial convolutions to extract local features. We will also incorporate skip connections to maintain the temporal context and prevent information loss.

The expected outcomes include improved accuracy in tactile data classification and regression tasks, as well as the ability to handle longer sequences of tactile data. Additionally, we anticipate that this approach will reduce the computational complexity compared to traditional recurrent neural networks, making it more practical for real-time applications.

The potential impact of this research is significant, as it will provide a robust framework for processing high-resolution tactile data, enabling advancements in various fields such as robotic applications, prosthetics, and augmented reality. By lowering the computational barriers, this research will facilitate the integration of touch processing into more widespread applications, fostering innovation and collaboration in the intersection of touch sensing and AI/ML.
