## **1. Title:** Active Temporal Tactile Representation Learning via Self-Supervised Contrastive Exploration

---

## **2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**

Touch is a fundamental sensory modality, providing rich information about object properties (texture, shape, stiffness) and interaction dynamics (slip, contact force). For robots operating in complex, unstructured environments, the ability to interpret tactile information is crucial for tasks ranging from dexterous manipulation and safe human-robot interaction to object identification and surface analysis [Workshop Call]. The increasing availability of high-resolution, cost-effective tactile sensors, such as vision-based tactile sensors (e.g., GelSight, TacTip) and distributed tactile skins, has spurred significant interest in developing computational methods for touch processing [Workshop Call].

However, making sense of touch data presents unique challenges distinct from other modalities like vision. Tactile data is intrinsically spatio-temporal; understanding an object often requires active exploration over time, involving sequences of contact events. Unlike static images, the information content in a tactile frame heavily depends on the preceding and succeeding frames and the interaction dynamics (e.g., pressure, shear, velocity) [Workshop Call]. Furthermore, tactile sensing is typically local, providing high-resolution data only within a small contact patch, necessitating exploratory procedures to build a holistic understanding [Workshop Call]. Compounding these issues are the high dimensionality and potential noise inherent in modern tactile sensor outputs [Lit Review Challenge 2], and the significant scarcity of large-scale, labeled tactile datasets [Lit Review Challenge 1]. This data scarcity severely limits the applicability of traditional supervised learning methods.

To overcome the reliance on labeled data, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm. SSL methods leverage inherent structures or relationships within the data itself to learn meaningful representations without manual annotations. Recent works have explored SSL for tactile perception, often using contrastive learning approaches that learn embeddings by distinguishing similar data points from dissimilar ones [2, 4, 7]. Some methods focus on leveraging temporal coherence in passive tactile sequences [5, 8] or integrating touch with other modalities like vision [3, 4]. Concurrently, research in active tactile exploration, often employing reinforcement learning (RL), aims to develop strategies for robots to intelligently interact with objects to maximize information gain for specific tasks like shape reconstruction [1] or texture recognition [6, 10]. These active approaches acknowledge that touch is not passive but an interactive process [Workshop Call].

**2.2 Research Gap and Problem Statement**

Despite progress in both SSL for tactile representation learning and RL for active tactile exploration, these two areas have largely been investigated separately. Existing SSL methods often assume passively collected datasets, potentially missing the rich information generated through deliberate, task-driven exploration. Conversely, active exploration methods typically focus on optimizing policies for a specific downstream task (e.g., classification accuracy, reconstruction quality) often using supervised signals or task-specific rewards, without explicitly learning general-purpose, temporal-aware representations from the interaction data itself in a self-supervised manner.

There is a compelling need for a unified framework that integrates the representation learning power of SSL with the information-seeking behaviour of active exploration. Such a framework should learn robust tactile representations that capture the crucial temporal dynamics of interaction, driven purely by self-supervised signals generated through an active exploration process optimized to gather informative data.

Therefore, the central research problem we address is: **How can we develop a self-supervised learning framework that jointly learns temporal-aware tactile representations and optimal active exploration policies, leveraging the synergy between contrastive learning on interaction sequences and reinforcement learning for information acquisition, without relying on manual annotations?**

**2.3 Research Objectives**

This research aims to develop and validate a novel self-supervised framework, termed Active Temporal Tactile Contrastive Exploration (AT-TCE), to address the identified gap. Our specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop the AT-TCE Framework:** Design and implement a novel framework that integrates:
    *   A **Temporal Contrastive Learning Module (TCLM)** that learns tactile representations by leveraging temporal coherence within actively collected interaction sequences.
    *   An **Active Exploration Module (AEM)** based on reinforcement learning that learns an exploration policy to maximize information gain, guided by self-supervised signals derived from the TCLM.
2.  **Create a Large-Scale Active Tactile Dataset:** Collect a new, diverse, large-scale tactile dataset featuring various materials and objects explored using controlled, active interaction strategies (e.g., varying speeds, pressures, trajectories). This dataset will be crucial for training and evaluating the AT-TCE framework.
3.  **Implement and Validate the Framework:** Train the AT-TCE framework on the newly collected dataset. Evaluate the quality of the learned representations on various downstream benchmark tasks relevant to tactile perception, such as texture classification, material identification, and slip detection.
4.  **Benchmark Performance:** Compare the performance of AT-TCE against relevant baselines, including:
    *   Supervised learning methods (trained on a labeled subset of the data).
    *   Passive SSL methods (e.g., contrastive learning on pre-recorded, non-active data).
    *   Active exploration methods using traditional reward functions.
    *   State-of-the-art tactile representation learning techniques [2, 5, 7].
5.  **Disseminate Resources:** Release the collected dataset and the source code implementation of the AT-TCE framework to the research community to promote reproducibility and further research [Workshop Call].

**2.4 Significance**

This research holds significant potential for advancing the field of touch processing and its applications. By developing a method that learns robust representations through self-supervised active exploration, we aim to:

*   **Reduce Reliance on Labeled Data:** Address a major bottleneck [Lit Review Challenge 1] by enabling effective learning from unlabeled tactile interaction data.
*   **Improve Tactile Understanding:** Learn representations that explicitly capture the crucial temporal dynamics [Lit Review Challenge 3] and active nature of touch, leading to better performance on downstream tasks compared to static or passive approaches.
*   **Enhance Robotic Capabilities:** Enable robots to autonomously explore and understand novel objects and environments through touch, improving capabilities in manipulation, interaction, and inspection, particularly in unstructured settings like agriculture or logistics [Workshop Call].
*   **Advance Related Fields:** Provide insights and tools applicable to prosthetics (sensory feedback) and AR/VR (realistic haptic rendering) [Workshop Call].
*   **Contribute Foundational Knowledge:** Offer a new perspective on integrating active perception and self-supervised representation learning, contributing to the foundations of computational touch processing [Workshop Call].
*   **Foster Community Growth:** Provide valuable open-source tools (dataset, code) to lower the entry barrier for AI researchers interested in touch processing [Workshop Call].

## **3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework: AT-TCE**

The proposed Active Temporal Tactile Contrastive Exploration (AT-TCE) framework consists of two core, interconnected modules operating within a closed loop: the Temporal Contrastive Learning Module (TCLM) and the Active Exploration Module (AEM).

1.  **AEM (RL Agent):** Interacts with the environment (an object surface) by executing actions (e.g., moving the sensor, applying pressure).
2.  **Tactile Sensor:** Captures sequences of high-resolution tactile readings during the interaction.
3.  **TCLM (SSL Module):** Processes these tactile sequences to learn robust, temporal-aware representations using a contrastive objective.
4.  **Self-Supervised Reward:** The TCLM provides signals (e.g., based on representation quality or change) used to compute a reward for the AEM.
5.  **Policy Update:** The AEM uses this reward signal to update its exploration policy, aiming to generate interactions that are maximally informative for the TCLM.

This loop allows the representation learning and exploration policy to co-adapt and improve synergistically.

**3.2 Data Collection**

To train and evaluate AT-TCE, we will collect a new Large-scale Active Tactile Interaction Dataset (LATID).

*   **Hardware:** We will utilize a standard robotic arm (e.g., Franka Emika Panda or UR5) equipped with a high-resolution vision-based tactile sensor (e.g., GelSight Mini or TacTip). Using a common platform facilitates reproducibility.
*   **Materials & Objects:** The dataset will include a diverse range of materials (~50-100 types) varying in texture (smooth, rough, patterned), compliance (soft, rigid), and shape (flat, curved, edged). We will use standardized material samples and potentially objects from common robotics datasets (e.g., YCB objects [1]).
*   **Interaction Primitives:** The AEM will learn to combine basic interaction primitives, but initial data collection might involve scripted motions like:
    *   Sliding/Stroking: Varying speeds, pressures, and directions.
    *   Pressing/Indentation: Varying forces and locations.
    *   Tapping: Varying frequencies and forces.
    *   Rolling: For exploring curved surfaces.
*   **Data Recorded:** For each interaction sequence, we will record:
    *   Raw tactile sensor data (e.g., sequence of tactile images or sensor readings) at a high frame rate (e.g., 30-60 Hz).
    *   Robot end-effector pose (position and orientation) and velocity.
    *   Applied force/torque readings (if available from the robot or sensor).
    *   Interaction parameters commanded by the policy (e.g., target velocity, force).
    *   Timestamp information.
    *   Metadata: Ground truth material/object ID (for evaluation only), environmental conditions.
*   **Scale:** We aim for thousands of interaction sequences across all materials, resulting in millions of tactile frames, comparable to or exceeding existing datasets [9].
*   **Accessibility:** The dataset will be structured, documented, and released publicly with tools for easy loading and processing.

**3.3 Temporal Contrastive Learning Module (TCLM)**

The TCLM learns representations from sequences of tactile data $X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_T\}$, where $x_t$ is the tactile reading at time $t$.

*   **Preprocessing:** Raw tactile data ($x_t$) will be preprocessed (e.g., normalization, background subtraction, potentially spatial filtering for noise reduction [Lit Review Challenge 2]).
*   **Encoder Architecture ($f_{enc}$):** To capture spatio-temporal dynamics [Lit Review Challenge 3], we will employ an encoder architecture suitable for sequential data. Candidates include:
    *   **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN):** Effective for capturing temporal dependencies with a fixed receptive field.
    *   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):** LSTM or GRU variants to model long-range dependencies.
    *   **3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN):** Treats the sequence as a spatio-temporal volume.
    The encoder maps an input sequence (or a sub-sequence) $X_{t:t+k}$ to a dense embedding vector $z = f_{enc}(X_{t:t+k})$.
*   **Contrastive Learning Objective:** We will use a temporal contrastive loss, inspired by InfoNCE [2, 4, 7], to enforce temporal coherence. The core idea is that representations of tactile patches close in time during a *continuous interaction* should be similar, while representations from distant times or different interactions should be dissimilar.
    *   **Positive Pairs:** For an anchor sequence ending at time $t$ with representation $z_t$, positive examples $z_p$ can be representations of overlapping sequences ending shortly after $t$ (e.g., $t+ \delta t$) from the *same* interaction trajectory. Data augmentation (e.g., small spatial distortions, noise injection) can also be used to generate positive pairs.
    *   **Negative Pairs:** Negative examples $z_{n_k}$ will be representations from:
        *   Sequences far removed in time within the same interaction.
        *   Sequences from entirely different interaction trajectories or different materials.
        *   Representations stored in a memory bank from past batches.
    *   **Loss Function:** The InfoNCE loss for an anchor $z_i$ is:
        $$ \mathcal{L}_{NCE} = - \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_p) / \tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_p) / \tau) + \sum_{k=1}^{N} \exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_{n_k}) / \tau)} $$
        where $\text{sim}(u, v) = u^T v / (\|u\| \|v\|)$ is the cosine similarity, $\tau$ is a temperature hyperparameter, $z_p$ is the positive sample embedding, and $\{z_{n_k}\}_{k=1}^N$ are the $N$ negative sample embeddings. The overall TCLM loss $\mathcal{L}_{TCLM}$ is the average $\mathcal{L}_{NCE}$ over all anchors in a batch.

**3.4 Active Exploration Module (AEM)**

The AEM uses RL to learn an optimal policy $\pi(a_t | s_t)$ for interacting with the environment to generate data that improves the TCLM representations.

*   **RL Framework:** We will use a model-free RL algorithm suitable for continuous state and action spaces, such as Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
*   **State Space ($S$):** The state $s_t$ provided to the RL agent should encapsulate relevant information for deciding the next action. It can include:
    *   The current tactile reading $x_t$.
    *   A short history of recent tactile readings $\{x_{t-h}, ..., x_t\}$.
    *   The learned tactile representation $z_t$ (or a recent history $z_{t-h:t}$) from the TCLM.
    *   Robot state information (e.g., end-effector pose, velocity).
*   **Action Space ($A$):** The action $a_t$ represents the control parameters for the tactile interaction. This could be:
    *   Target end-effector velocity vector $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^3$.
    *   Target applied normal force $p \in \mathbb{R}^+$.
    *   Duration of the action $\Delta t$.
    The action space will be defined based on the capabilities of the robot and sensor, with appropriate bounds.
*   **Policy ($\pi(a|s)$):** The policy will be represented by a neural network (e.g., MLP or a network incorporating convolutional/recurrent layers if the state includes raw tactile data) that outputs parameters of a distribution over actions (e.g., mean and variance for a Gaussian policy in SAC).
*   **Reward Function ($R_t$):** This is critical for self-supervised active exploration [Lit Review Challenge 4]. The reward should encourage the agent to explore in ways that generate informative data for the TCLM. We propose an intrinsic reward based on the principle of maximizing information gain, approximated by:
    *   **Representation Change/Novelty:** Encourage actions leading to significant changes or variance in the learned tactile representation $z_t$. A large change suggests new information is being acquired. $R_{novelty} = \| z_t - z_{t-1} \|^2$ or variance over a short window.
    *   **Contrastive Loss Maximization:** Encourage actions that lead to data points which are hard for the current contrastive model to discriminate (i.e., result in higher $\mathcal{L}_{NCE}$), thereby pushing the representation learning forward. $R_{loss} = \mathcal{L}_{NCE}(X_{t:t+k})$.
    *   **Exploration Bonus:** Add terms to encourage visiting diverse states or trying diverse actions (e.g., based on state visitation counts or action entropy).
    *   **Regularization/Cost:** Penalize overly aggressive actions (e.g., excessive force, high speeds) to ensure safety and realistic interactions. $R_{cost} = - c_1 \| \vec{v} \|^2 - c_2 p^2$.
    The final reward will be a weighted combination: $R_t = w_1 R_{novelty/loss} + w_2 R_{bonus} + w_3 R_{cost}$. The weights ($w_i$) will be tuned hyperparameters.

**3.5 Joint Training Procedure**

The TCLM and AEM will be trained iteratively or in an alternating fashion:

1.  **Initialization:** Initialize the TCLM encoder ($f_{enc}$) and the AEM policy ($\pi$) networks. Collect some initial data using random or simple scripted exploration policies.
2.  **Representation Learning:** Train the TCLM encoder $f_{enc}$ using the contrastive loss $\mathcal{L}_{TCLM}$ on batches of interaction sequences collected using the current AEM policy $\pi$.
3.  **Policy Learning:** Train the AEM policy $\pi$ using the chosen RL algorithm (e.g., SAC). The rewards $R_t$ are computed based on the representations $z_t$ generated by the *current* TCLM encoder $f_{enc}$ and the defined self-supervised reward function. The agent interacts with the environment (or a simulator, if available) to collect new trajectories.
4.  **Iteration:** Repeat steps 2 and 3. The improving representations from TCLM provide better state information and more meaningful reward signals for AEM, while the improving policy from AEM collects more informative data for TCLM.

**3.6 Experimental Design and Validation**

*   **Evaluation Tasks:** We will evaluate the quality of the learned representations ($z = f_{enc}(X)$) by freezing the encoder after self-supervised training and training simple downstream classifiers/regressors on top, or by fine-tuning the encoder. Target tasks include:
    *   **Texture/Material Classification:** Using LATID labels (held-out).
    *   **(Optional) Object Identification:** If distinct objects are used in LATID.
    *   **(Optional) Slip Detection:** Requires specific interaction data simulating slip.
    *   We will also potentially evaluate on existing public tactile datasets (e.g., for texture) to assess generalization, possibly requiring adaptation strategies if sensor types differ [2, Lit Review Challenge 5].
*   **Baselines for Comparison:**
    1.  **Supervised Baseline:** Train the same encoder architecture ($f_{enc}$) end-to-end on a labeled subset of LATID for the downstream tasks.
    2.  **Passive SSL Baseline:** Train the TCLM using the same contrastive loss but on passively collected data (e.g., random or fixed exploration patterns) without the AEM.
    3.  **Standard RL Baseline:** Train the AEM with a task-specific reward (e.g., classification accuracy on a validation set) instead of the self-supervised intrinsic reward.
    4.  **State-of-the-Art Methods:** Implement and compare against relevant methods from the literature, such as purely contrastive touch methods [2, 7] or potentially multimodal methods adapted for touch-only [3, 4].
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Downstream Task Performance:** Accuracy, F1-Score, AUC for classification tasks. Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks.
    *   **Data Efficiency:** Performance on downstream tasks as a function of the amount of unlabeled interaction data used during self-supervised training.
    *   **Exploration Efficiency:** Evaluate the AEM policy in terms of how quickly it enables the TCLM to learn good representations or how well it performs on a task requiring exploration (e.g., finding a specific feature on an object).
    *   **Representation Quality:** Use metrics like K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification accuracy in the embedding space, or linear probe accuracy.
