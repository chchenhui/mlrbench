**Title:** Unbalanced Optimal Transport for Robust Domain Adaptation in Heterogeneous Data  

**Motivation:** Domain adaptation (DA) often fails when source and target datasets exhibit mass imbalance (e.g., differing sample sizes or class distributions), as standard OT requires equal mass. Real-world applications like medical imaging or cross-sensor data fusion face this challenge, leading to biased alignment. This research addresses mass heterogeneity in DA by leveraging unbalanced OT to enable robust transfers.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a DA framework integrating unbalanced OT, which relaxes mass conservation constraints. The method jointly learns domain-invariant features and computes transport plans between unequal masses using divergence-based penalties (e.g., Kullback-Leibler) instead of strict marginal constraints. A neural network will minimize a hybrid loss combining classification error, feature alignment via unbalanced OT, and semantic regularization. Experiments on imbalanced benchmarks (e.g., medical imaging with varying patient cohorts, skewed class ratios) will validate improved transfer accuracy over balanced OT baselines. Expected outcomes include theoretical guarantees on alignment stability under mass shifts and scalable solvers for high-dimensional data. Impact: Enables DA in previously intractable scenarios like long-tailed distributions or resource-constrained data collection.
