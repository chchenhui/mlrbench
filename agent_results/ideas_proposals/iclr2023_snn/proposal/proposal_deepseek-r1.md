**Research Proposal: Adaptive Compute Fabric for Hardware-Software Co-Designed Sparse Neural Network Training**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

**Background**  
Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains, but their computational and environmental costs are unsustainable. Training billion-parameter models requires massive energy consumption, carbon emissions, and specialized hardware that quickly becomes obsolete. While sparsity—pruning redundant weights during training—has emerged as a promising solution to reduce computational overhead, existing hardware (e.g., GPUs) struggles to exploit sparsity efficiently. Current accelerators are optimized for dense matrix operations, leading to underutilization when processing irregular sparse patterns. This mismatch limits both the practical speedups of sparse training algorithms and their adoption in real-world applications.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research proposes an **Adaptive Compute Fabric (ACF)**, a hardware-software co-designed system tailored for sparse neural network training. The objectives are:  
1. Design a reconfigurable hardware architecture that dynamically adapts to irregular sparsity patterns during training.  
2. Co-develop sparse training algorithms (e.g., structured pruning) optimized for the ACF’s capabilities.  
3. Validate the system’s efficiency gains in training time, energy consumption, and scalability while maintaining model accuracy.  

**Significance**  
By bridging the gap between sparse algorithms and hardware, the ACF will enable sustainable training of large models with reduced resource requirements. This work addresses critical challenges in hardware design, sparsity-aware optimization, and environmental impact, directly contributing to the machine learning community’s push toward efficient and scalable AI systems.

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### **2.1 Hardware Architecture Design**  
The ACF comprises three key components:  

**A. Sparse Compute Units (SCUs)**  
SCUs dynamically bypass zero-operand multiplications and accumulations (MACs) using a **Sparse Operand Gating Unit (SOGU)**. For a weight matrix $W$ and activation vector $a$, the SOGU identifies non-zero pairs $(W_{ij}, a_j)$ and processes only those via MAC units. The gating logic is implemented as:  
$$
\text{Output}_i = \sum_{j \in \{k \,|\, W_{ik} \neq 0 \land a_k \neq 0\}} W_{ik} \cdot a_k
$$  
This reduces FLOPs proportionally to the sparsity level.  

**B. Sparsity-Aware Memory Controllers**  
Non-zero weights and activations are stored in compressed formats (e.g., CSR, CSC) to minimize memory bandwidth. A **Sparse Index Cache** prefetches indices of non-zero elements, while a **Load Balancer** distributes irregular workloads across SCUs to avoid idle cycles.  

**C. Reconfigurable Interconnect**  
A network-on-chip (NoC) dynamically routes data between SCUs and memory based on sparsity patterns. The interconnect uses a hybrid of mesh and tree topologies to balance locality and scalability.  

#### **2.2 Algorithm-Hardware Co-Design**  

**Structured Sparsity Constraints**  
To maximize ACF utilization, we propose **Tile-Wise Magnitude Pruning** with hardware-aware constraints. Weights are partitioned into tiles of size $T \times T$, and tiles with the lowest $L_1$-norm are pruned:  
$$
\text{Prune tile } \mathcal{T} \text{ if } \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{T}} |W_{ij}| < \theta \cdot \max_{\mathcal{T'}}\left(\sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{T'}} |W_{ij}|\right)
$$  
where $\theta$ is a threshold tuned to match the ACF’s memory burst size. This balances irregularity (for accuracy) and regularity (for hardware efficiency).  

**Dynamic Sparsity Adaptation**  
During training, a **Sparsity Monitor** tracks layer-wise sparsity and adjusts the pruning rate $\theta$ to maintain a target hardware utilization (e.g., 80% of SCUs active per cycle).  

#### **2.3 Experimental Design**  

**Benchmarks and Baselines**  
- **Models**: ResNet-50, Transformer, and a sparse variant of GPT-2.  
- **Datasets**: ImageNet, WikiText-103.  
- **Baselines**: NVIDIA A100 GPU, TPU v4, and state-of-the-art sparse accelerators (Procrustes, TensorDash).  

**Evaluation Metrics**  
1. **Training Efficiency**: Time per epoch (seconds), energy consumption (Joules).  
2. **Hardware Utilization**: SCU activity rate, memory bandwidth usage.  
3. **Model Performance**: Top-1 accuracy (vision), perplexity (language), sparsity level (%).  
4. **Scalability**: Training speedup vs. model size (up to 10B parameters).  

**Validation Workflow**  
1. **Simulation**: Use Gem5-Aladdin for cycle-accurate simulation of the ACF.  
2. **FPGA Prototyping**: Deploy a scaled-down ACF on Xilinx Versal FPGAs to measure power and latency.  
3. **Algorithm Testing**: Compare tile-wise pruning against unstructured and block sparsity on PyTorch.

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. A 3–5× reduction in training time and energy consumption compared to GPUs for models with 80–95% sparsity.  
2. ACF hardware utilization exceeding 75% across varying sparsity patterns, outperforming Procrustes (65%) and TensorDash (60%).  
3. No accuracy degradation relative to dense models at iso-parameter count, validated on ImageNet (within 0.5% top-1 drop) and WikiText-103 (perplexity difference < 1.0).  

**Broader Impact**  
- **Sustainability**: Lower carbon footprint per training run, enabling greener AI.  
- **Democratization**: Reduced hardware costs could make large-model training accessible to smaller organizations.  
- **Hardware Innovation**: ACF’s reconfigurable design may inspire future architectures for sparse computation in domains like robotics and reinforcement learning.

The project’s outcomes will provide both theoretical insights into sparsity optimization and practical tools for deploying eco-friendly machine learning systems.
