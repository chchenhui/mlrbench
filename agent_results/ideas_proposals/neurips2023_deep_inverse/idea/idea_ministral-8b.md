### Title: Enhancing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning-Based Inverse Problems

### Motivation:
Model uncertainty is a critical challenge in deep learning-based inverse problems, particularly when the forward model is only partially known or when the system's behavior is complex. Existing solutions often assume simple models of distortion and rely heavily on accurate forward models, which may not hold in real-world scenarios. Addressing model uncertainty can lead to more robust and reliable inverse problem solutions, with significant implications for applications in medical imaging, seismic analysis, and computational photography.

### Main Idea:
This research aims to develop novel algorithms and analysis techniques to handle model uncertainty in deep learning-based inverse problems. By leveraging probabilistic approaches and robust optimization methods, we propose to enhance the resilience of inverse problem solvers to incomplete or inaccurate forward models. The key methodology involves:
1. **Probabilistic Deep Learning**: Incorporating Bayesian deep learning techniques to model and propagate uncertainty in the inverse problem solutions.
2. **Robust Optimization**: Employing robust optimization methods to ensure that the inverse problem solutions are not overly sensitive to small perturbations in the forward model.
3. **Data-Driven Model Uncertainty**: Using data-driven approaches to estimate and incorporate uncertainty in the forward model, even when partial information is available.

Expected outcomes include:
- Improved accuracy and robustness of inverse problem solutions in scenarios with incomplete or uncertain forward models.
- Development of new theoretical frameworks and algorithms for handling model uncertainty in deep learning-based inverse problems.
- Potential applications in medical tomography, seismic imaging, and computational photography, where model uncertainty is a significant challenge.

Potential impact:
- Enhanced reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning-based inverse problem solutions.
- Broader applicability of machine learning techniques to real-world inverse problems with complex and uncertain forward models.
- Facilitation of new collaborations between mathematicians, computer scientists, physicists, and biologists to address model uncertainty in inverse problems.
