# Modular Compositional Adapters for Robust Generalization in Foundation Models

## Motivation
Despite the impressive capabilities of foundation models, they often struggle with compositional generalization outside their training distribution. Modular learning approaches like adapters offer a potential solution but the relationship between modularity and compositional generalization remains unclear. This research addresses the critical question: does architectural modularity guarantee compositional generalization, and what specific modular structures best support compositional capabilities? Understanding this relationship is vital for developing models that can reliably combine learned components in novel ways across diverse tasks.

## Main Idea
We propose a systematic investigation of the correlation between modular structures and compositional generalization in foundation models. Our approach involves developing a taxonomy of adapter architectures with varying degrees of parameter sharing, routing mechanisms, and compositional interfaces. We will evaluate these designs on carefully constructed benchmarks requiring different forms of compositional generalization (systematic, productive, substitutional). The research will produce: (1) empirical evidence revealing which modular structures best support different types of compositional generalization, (2) a theoretical framework explaining why certain modular designs succeed or fail in compositional tasks, and (3) practical design principles for "compositional adapters" that can be plugged into existing foundation models to enhance their ability to generalize compositionally with minimal additional training.
