---

### 1. Introduction  

**Background**  
Digital computing faces fundamental limitations in scalability, performance, and sustainability, exacerbated by the explosive compute demands of generative AI. Emerging non-traditional computing paradigms—such as analog, neuromorphic, and optical systems—offer energy-efficient alternatives but struggle with inherent noise, limited precision, and device mismatch. Deep equilibrium models (DEQs), which compute outputs as fixed points of iterative dynamical systems, align naturally with the dynamics of physical hardware. Co-designing DEQs with analog systems presents a unique opportunity to leverage hardware-native convergence for energy-efficient inference and training while addressing hardware imperfections through algorithmic robustness.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research aims to:  
1. Develop a **hybrid analog-digital DEQ framework** where analog hardware natively computes equilibrium states, while digital layers parameterize system dynamics.  
2. Integrate **physics-aware training** to simulate analog noise and constraints during backpropagation, ensuring model robustness.  
3. Validate the framework on tasks requiring iterative convergence (e.g., control systems, physics simulations) and benchmark its energy efficiency, scalability, and accuracy against traditional DEQs and digital analogs.  

**Significance**  
By bridging DEQs and analog hardware, this work could:  
- Reduce energy consumption and latency by orders of magnitude for equilibrium-based tasks.  
- Enable scalable deployment of energy-based models on edge devices (e.g., robotics, IoT).  
- Establish a blueprint for co-designing ML models with non-traditional hardware, advancing sustainable AI.

### 2. Methodology  

#### 2.1 Research Design  
The framework combines analog hardware for equilibrium computation and digital layers for parameterization, trained via physics-aware backpropagation.  

**2.1.1 Hybrid Analog-Digital DEQ Architecture**  
- **Analog Block**: Implements the fixed-point iteration $z_{t+1} = f_\theta(z_t, x)$, where $f_\theta$ is realized via analog circuits (e.g., resistive crossbars for matrix operations). The analog system naturally converges to $z^*$ satisfying $z^* = f_\theta(z^*, x)$.  
- **Digital Block**: Parameterizes the input injection $x$ and feedback terms using low-precision digital layers to guide the analog dynamics.  

**2.1.2 Physics-Aware Training**  
To account for analog hardware imperfections (noise, low bit-depth), training employs a **differentiable proxy** that simulates hardware behavior during backpropagation:  
1. **Forward Pass**: Solve $z^* = f_\theta(z^*, x)$ using a numerical solver (e.g., Anderson acceleration) with injected noise $\eta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ and quantized weights.  
2. **Backward Pass**: Compute gradients via the adjoint sensitivity method, which avoids storing intermediate states:  
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta} = -\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z^*} \left( I - \frac{\partial f_\theta}{\partial z^*} \right)^{-1} \frac{\partial f_\theta}{\partial \theta}.
$$  
3. **Physics-Informed Regularization**: Augment the task loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$ with a physics-based term $\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}$ to enforce hardware-compatible dynamics (e.g., sparsity in feedback connections):  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}.
$$  

**2.1.3 Data Collection & Tasks**  
- **Datasets**: ImageNet-32 (classification), PDE-based simulation datasets (e.g., fluid dynamics), and control system benchmarks (e.g., pendulum swing-up).  
- **Baselines**: Compare against digital DEQs, analog neural networks, and ff-EBMs from recent literature.  

**2.1.4 Experimental Design**  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Energy Efficiency**: Measured in joules per inference (J/inf) using hardware simulators (e.g., SPICE for analog components).  
  - **Convergence Time**: Iterations to reach equilibrium (compared to digital solvers).  
  - **Robustness**: Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and accuracy under varying noise levels.  
  - **Task Performance**: Classification accuracy (ImageNet), simulation error (PDE tasks).  
- **Ablation Studies**:  
  - Impact of physics-aware training vs. standard backpropagation.  
  - Sensitivity to analog bit-depth (4–8 bits) and noise levels ($\sigma = 0.01$–$0.1$).

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Energy and Latency Reduction**: The hybrid framework is expected to reduce energy consumption by 10–100× and convergence time by 5–20× compared to digital DEQs, validated on control and PDE tasks.  
2. **Robustness to Hardware Noise**: Physics-aware training will maintain >90% baseline accuracy under 8-bit analog precision and SNR ≥ 20 dB.  
3. **Scalability**: Demonstration of the framework on ImageNet-32 with ≤5% accuracy drop compared to digital ff-EBMs.  

**Broader Impact**  
- **Sustainable AI**: By exploiting analog hardware’s energy efficiency, this work could mitigate the environmental footprint of large-scale ML.  
- **Edge Computing**: Enable real-time inference for robotics and IoT devices with limited power budgets.  
- **Co-Design Paradigms**: Establish methodologies for integrating physical system dynamics into ML training, advancing hardware-algorithm synergy.
