# Title: Physics-Informed Deep Equilibrium Models for Analog Hardware Co-Design

## 1. Introduction

### Background

The field of machine learning (ML) has witnessed remarkable advancements, but it is increasingly constrained by the limitations of traditional digital computing. Digital computing, while highly reliable and versatile, faces challenges in terms of scalability, performance, and sustainability. Generative AI, in particular, is fueling an explosion in compute demand, making it imperative to explore new compute paradigms. Analog and neuromorphic hardware offer promising alternatives, with the potential for energy-efficient computation. However, these hardware technologies suffer from inherent noise, device mismatch, and limited precision, which hinder their effective deployment in ML tasks.

Deep equilibrium networks (DEQs), which compute outputs as fixed points of iterative dynamical systems, provide a natural convergence mechanism that can be exploited by analog hardware. By co-designing DEQs with analog hardware, we can leverage the hardware's inherent dynamics to accelerate equilibrium-based inference and training, bypassing the bottlenecks of traditional architectures. This synergy could lead to significant reductions in energy and time for tasks requiring sequential state convergence, such as control systems and physics simulations.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop a hybrid analog-digital DEQ framework that combines the strengths of digital and analog computing to improve the efficiency and sustainability of machine learning at scale. Specifically, the research aims to:

1. **Propose a hybrid analog-digital DEQ framework**: Develop a framework where analog circuits natively implement the dynamical system's convergence phase, while digital layers parameterize the system's input and feedback terms.
2. **Simulate analog behavior during training**: Use a physics-aware differentiable proxy to simulate analog behavior (noise, low precision) during backpropagation, ensuring robustness to hardware imperfections.
3. **Evaluate the framework**: Assess the performance of the proposed framework on tasks requiring sequential state convergence, comparing it with traditional digital architectures.

### Significance

The successful development of this hybrid framework could catalyze sustainable, scalable analog-ML systems for applications like edge robotics and real-time optimization. By redefining ML-model/hardware co-design, this research has the potential to significantly advance the field of machine learning and contribute to the development of more energy-efficient and scalable computing systems.

### Research Design

The proposed research will follow a systematic approach to develop and evaluate the hybrid analog-digital DEQ framework. The methodology can be broken down into several key steps:

1. **Framework Design**: Develop the hybrid analog-digital DEQ framework, where analog circuits implement the convergence phase and digital layers parameterize the system's input and feedback terms.
2. **Physics-Aware Training**: Implement a physics-aware differentiable proxy to simulate analog behavior during training, enabling robust backpropagation through the hybrid framework.
3. **Experimental Validation**: Evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on tasks requiring sequential state convergence, comparing it with traditional digital architectures.
4. **Optimization and Scaling**: Optimize the framework for energy efficiency and scalability, addressing the key challenges of hardware imperfections, scalability, and integration of physical priors.

### Data Collection

The data collection process will involve:

1. **Simulated Data**: Generate synthetic data to simulate the behavior of analog hardware, including noise and low precision.
2. **Real-World Data**: Collect real-world datasets that require sequential state convergence, such as control systems and physics simulations.
3. **Benchmark Datasets**: Utilize benchmark datasets from existing literature to compare the performance of the proposed framework with traditional digital architectures.

### Algorithmic Steps

The algorithmic steps for the proposed hybrid analog-digital DEQ framework are as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the parameters of the digital layers and the initial state of the analog circuits.
2. **Forward Pass**:
   - Compute the input and feedback terms using the digital layers.
   - Pass the input and feedback terms to the analog circuits to compute the equilibrium state.
   - Combine the digital and analog outputs to obtain the final prediction.
3. **Loss Calculation**: Calculate the loss between the predicted output and the ground truth.
4. **Backpropagation**:
   - Compute the gradients of the digital layers using standard backpropagation.
   - Simulate the analog behavior during backpropagation using a physics-aware differentiable proxy.
   - Update the parameters of the digital layers using the computed gradients.
5. **Iteration**: Repeat steps 2-4 for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence.

### Mathematical Formulation

The equilibrium state \( \mathbf{x}^* \) of the dynamical system can be computed as the fixed point of the iterative process:
\[ \mathbf{x}^* = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}) \]
where \( \mathbf{f} \) is the dynamical system function, \( \mathbf{x} \) is the state, and \( \mathbf{u} \) is the input. The digital layers parameterize the input and feedback terms, while the analog circuits implement the convergence phase.

The loss function \( L \) can be defined as:
\[ L = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \hat{y}_i - y_i \right)^2 \]
where \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted output and \( y_i \) is the ground truth for the \( i \)-th sample.

The gradients of the digital layers can be computed using standard backpropagation:
\[ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{w}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial \mathbf{w}} \]
where \( \mathbf{w} \) represents the parameters of the digital layers.
