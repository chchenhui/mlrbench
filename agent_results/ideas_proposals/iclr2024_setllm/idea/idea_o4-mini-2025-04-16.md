Title: Retrieval-Calibrated Fact Validator for Reducing LLM Hallucinations

Motivation:  
Large language models often generate plausible-sounding but incorrect statements (“hallucinations”), undermining trust in applications like question answering and summarization. Existing retrieval-augmented methods still suffer when retrieved documents are noisy or spurious. This research aims to build a dynamic verification layer that calibrates LLM outputs against evidence, reducing ungrounded content.

Main Idea:  
We propose a multi-stage pipeline combining retrieval, generation, and contrastive verification. First, a retriever fetches top-k candidate passages from a trusted knowledge base. Second, an LLM generates responses grounded on these passages. Third, a lightweight verifier—trained with contrastive learning on true versus decoy citations—assigns a veracity score and identifies unsupported claims. During training, the generator and verifier share representations and are optimized jointly: the generator learns to maximize verifier confidence, while the verifier sharpens its margin between correct and hallucinated claims. At inference, the system outputs an answer, linked evidence snippets, and a confidence score. Experiments on FEVER and Truthful-QA benchmarks are expected to show a significant drop in hallucination rates (≥15%) and improved interpretability, enabling more trustworthy LLM deployments.
