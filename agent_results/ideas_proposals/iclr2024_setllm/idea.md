**Title:** Proactive Detection of Hallucinations via Internal Confidence Calibration

**Motivation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate convincing yet factually incorrect statements (hallucinations), eroding trust and limiting their reliable use. Post-hoc fact-checking is often insufficient or slow. This research aims to develop methods for LLMs to proactively identify and signal potential hallucinations *during* generation based on their internal states.

**Main Idea:** We propose training LLMs to calibrate their internal confidence scores with actual factual accuracy. The core idea is to fine-tune LLMs using contrastive learning on datasets containing both factual statements and generated hallucinations. The model will learn to associate lower internal confidence metrics (e.g., entropy of the predicted token distribution, activation patterns in specific layers) with hallucinated content and higher confidence with factual content. During inference, if the internal confidence for a generated statement falls below a learned threshold, the LLM can flag it as potentially unreliable or preface it with uncertainty markers. This approach aims for inherent hallucination awareness, improving LLM trustworthiness without solely relying on external verification tools.
