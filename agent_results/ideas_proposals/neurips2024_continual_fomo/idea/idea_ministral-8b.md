### Title: Scalable Continual Learning with Incremental Knowledge Graph Embeddings

### Motivation
As foundation models (FMs) become increasingly large and complex, the need for continual learning (CL) to adapt to new data and knowledge is paramount. Current CL methods struggle with the scale and diversity of real-world data, leading to issues like catastrophic forgetting and inefficient resource utilization. This research aims to address these challenges by integrating CL with knowledge graphs (KGs), enabling scalable and efficient updates to FMs.

### Main Idea
The proposed research focuses on developing a scalable CL framework that leverages incremental knowledge graph embeddings. The methodology involves:
1. **Knowledge Graph Embeddings**: Representing FM knowledge as embeddings within a KG, allowing for incremental updates.
2. **Continual Learning with Graph Convolutions**: Utilizing graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to update FM embeddings in a continual manner, preserving knowledge while adapting to new data.
3. **Domain Shift Mitigation**: Employing meta-learning techniques to adapt to domain shifts and long-tailed data distributions.

The expected outcomes include:
- **Efficient CL**: Reduced computational resources and time for updating FMs.
- **Preserved Knowledge**: Mitigation of catastrophic forgetting through incremental updates.
- **Scalability**: Handling large-scale real-world datasets with diverse distributions.

The potential impact is significant, as this approach could revolutionize the way FMs are trained and updated, making them more adaptable and efficient in dynamic real-world scenarios.
