**Dynamic Knowledge-Graph-Infused Adapters for Scalable Continual Learning in Lifelong Foundation Models**

### 2. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly central to artificial intelligence, yet their static training paradigms struggle to capture evolving real-world knowledge. Retraining these models on new data is computationally prohibitive, and even fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting—where prior knowledge is overwritten. Continual learning (CL) offers a pathway to lifelong adaptation, but existing methods fail to scale efficiently for modern FMs. Meanwhile, structured knowledge graphs (KGs) have proven effective for encoding relational information in domains like language and vision, but their integration with CL frameworks remains underexplored.  

**Research Objectives**  
This proposal aims to develop a scalable CL framework that combines lightweight neural adapters with dynamic knowledge graphs to enable efficient lifelong learning in FMs. Specifically, we address:  
1. **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Mitigation via structured KG-guided parameter updates.  
2. **Scalability**: Sparse retrieval of KG subgraphs and low-rank adapters to minimize compute.  
3. **Domain Adaptation**: Robust handling of long-tailed data and domain shifts through knowledge fusion.  
4. **Evaluation**: Benchmarking across multimodal tasks with standardized metrics.  

**Significance**  
By integrating dynamic KGs with parameter-efficient adapters, this work seeks to transform how FMs adapt to evolving data. The proposed framework will reduce reliance on repeated fine-tuning, lower computational costs, and improve model versatility in real-world scenarios with shifting domains and data scarcity. This directly addresses critical challenges outlined in the workshop, including scalable CL strategies and the role of structured knowledge in lifelong learning.

### 3. **Methodology**  
**3.1 Overview**  
The framework consists of three components:  
1. **Dynamic Knowledge Graph**: Incrementally constructs subgraphs for new tasks and consolidates them periodically.  
2. **KG-Infused Adapters**: Lightweight modules that retrieve task-relevant KG embeddings via cross-attention.  
3. **Sparse Retrieval Engine**: Efficiently loads subgraphs during inference to minimize memory overhead.  

**3.2 Dynamic Knowledge Graph Construction**  
- **Subgraph Creation**: For each task $t$, extract entities and relations from data to form a subgraph $G_t = (V_t, E_t)$, where $V_t$ are nodes (e.g., objects in images, entities in text) and $E_t$ are edges (relations).  
- **Graph Consolidation**: Periodically merge overlapping subgraphs to control growth. Let $G_c$ be the consolidated graph at iteration $k$:  
  $$G_c = \bigcup_{i=1}^k G_i \setminus \{(v, r, v') \mid \text{redundant or conflicting}\}.$$  
  Redundancy is determined via semantic similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity of entity embeddings).  

**3.3 Adapter Architecture**  
Each adapter $A_t$ for task $t$ includes:  
- **Input Projection**: Maps FM output $h \in \mathbb{R}^d$ to query $q = W_q h$, where $W_q \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$.  
- **Cross-Attention KG Retrieval**: Compute attention scores between $q$ and KG entity embeddings $K \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$:  
  $$\alpha_i = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{q K_i^T}{\sqrt{d}}\right), \quad \text{output: } o = \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i K_i.$$  
- **Output Fusion**: Combine retrieved knowledge $o$ with $h$ via a gating mechanism:  
  $$h' = h + \sigma(W_g [h; o]) \cdot (W_o o),$$  
  where $W_g, W_o$ are trainable weights and $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.  

**3.4 Training Protocol**  
1. **Task-Specific Training**: For task $t$, freeze the FM and train $A_t$ using a hybrid loss:  
   $$\mathcal{L}_t = \mathcal{L}_\text{task}(y, \hat{y}) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_\text{kg}(o, G_t),$$  
   where $\mathcal{L}_\text{kg}$ ensures alignment between $o$ and ground-truth KG facts.  
2. **Graph Consolidation**: After every $N$ tasks, merge subgraphs and retrain affected adapters with distillation loss to preserve old knowledge:  
   $$\mathcal{L}_\text{distill} = \text{KL}\left(p_\text{old}(x) \Vert p_\text{new}(x)\right).$$  

**3.5 Experimental Design**  
- **Datasets**:  
  - **CLiMB** [1]: A multimodal benchmark for evaluating continual learning with vision-language tasks.  
  - **K-LongTail**: A custom dataset simulating long-tailed distributions across 10 domains (e.g., medical imaging, low-resource languages).  
- **Baselines**: Compare against full fine-tuning, K-Adapter [4], Linked Adapters [1], and Incremental LoRA [2].  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Average Accuracy (AA)**: Across all tasks.  
  - **Forgetting Measure (FM)**: $\frac{1}{T-1}\sum_{t=1}^{T-1} a_{t,\text{max}} - a_{t,\text{final}}$.  
  - **Training Time/GPU Memory**: Relative to baseline methods.  

**3.6 Implementation Details**  
- Base Model: Pre-trained Vision-Language FM (e.g., CLIP).  
- Adapter Rank: Rank $r=8$ for LoRA-style weight matrices.  
- KG Embeddings: Initialized with TransE [2] and fineuned end-to-end.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  
**Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Improved Knowledge Retention**: The KG-infused adapters will outperform baselines by 15–20% on FM and AA metrics, particularly in long-tailed and domain-shift scenarios.  
2. **Reduced Compute**: Sparse retrieval and low-rank adapters will cut training time by 40% and memory use by 30% compared to full fine-tuning.  
3. **Generalization**: The framework will demonstrate consistent performance across modalities (text, vision) and tasks (classification, generation).  

**Broader Impact**  
- **Sustainable AI**: By minimizing retraining, the method reduces the carbon footprint of maintaining FMs.  
- **Real-World Adaptability**: Enables FMs to handle evolving domains like healthcare and climate science, where data distribution shifts are common.  
- **Benchmarking Standards**: The proposed evaluation protocols will provide a foundation for future CL research.

### 5. **Conclusion**  
This proposal addresses a critical gap in scalable continual learning by integrating dynamic knowledge graphs with parameter-efficient adapters. The framework offers a principled approach to lifelong FM adaptation, balancing computational efficiency with robust knowledge preservation. Successful execution will advance the development of truly dynamic, general-purpose AI systems.
