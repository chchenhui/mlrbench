Title  
Dynamic Knowledge-Graph-Infused Adapters for Scalable Continual Learning in Foundation Models  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Foundation models (FMs) such as large‐scale transformers have ushered in breakthroughs across language, vision, and multimodal tasks.  However, the static pretraining paradigm that underlies most FMs cannot accommodate ever‐changing real‐world data.  Continual learning (CL) offers a framework for updating models on a stream of tasks or domains, but existing CL methods (e.g., replay buffers, weight regularization, standalone adapters) struggle at FM scale.  They either suffer catastrophic forgetting when absorbing new knowledge or incur prohibitive compute and memory costs when fine‐tuning massive parameters.  
Meanwhile, structured knowledge sources—knowledge graphs (KGs), ontologies, relational databases—encode rich, symbolic, and long‐term facts that remain more stable than raw data distributions.  Prior work (K‐Adapter, incremental LoRA KG embeddings) shows that injecting structured knowledge via adapters can improve single‐task performance, but has not been fully leveraged in a truly scalable, continual learning regime for FMs.  

Objectives  
We propose to develop Dynamic Knowledge‐Graph‐Infused Adapters (DKG‐Adapters), a novel, lightweight CL framework that:  
1.  Maintains an evolving KG encoding entities and relations encountered over a lifelong stream of data distributions.  
2.  Inserts small adapter modules augmented with cross‐attention to the KG at each transformer layer, so new information is grounded in structured facts and parameter drift is minimized.  
3.  Employs sparse subgraph retrieval to load only relevant KG fragments per input, ensuring computational efficiency.  
4.  Periodically consolidates redundant KG nodes and prunes low‐utility facts to keep KG size in check.  

Significance  
By marrying structured knowledge with parameter‐light adapters, DKG‐Adapters aim to:  
• Preserve long‐term knowledge and mitigate catastrophic forgetting without full‐model retraining.  
• Drastically reduce the compute and data requirements of FM updates.  
• Handle domain shifts and long‐tailed distributions encountered in real‐world CL.  
• Provide an extensible blueprint for combining KGs with multimodal and multilingual foundation models.  

2. Methodology  
2.1 System Overview  
At each task step _t_, we receive a new dataset Dₜ drawn from a potentially shifted distribution (e.g., a new domain in language, a new class set in vision, or a new modality).  Our system jointly updates:  
• The KG Gₜ = (Vₜ, Eₜ), embedding entities and relations seen so far.  
• A set of adapter weights Θₜ = {W_down^l, W_up^l, W_Q^l, W_V^l, W_K^l}_ {l=1…L} inserted into the FM’s L transformer layers.  

Crucially, the FM’s pretrained parameters remain frozen; only the adapters and KG embeddings are updated.  

2.2 Knowledge Graph Construction and Maintenance  
Entity & Relation Extraction  
We apply state‐of‐the‐art pipelines (e.g., spaCy, Stanford OpenIE, scene graph parsers) to detect entities and relations in Dₜ:  
• For text: named‐entity recognition (NER) and relation classification yield a subgraph Sₜ = (V^new, E^new).  
• For images: object detectors plus scene‐graph extraction (e.g., MOTIFS) produce visual triples.  
• For multimodal: vision‐language grounding networks associate text spans with image regions, yielding aligned facts.  

Graph Update  
We define the global KG at time _t_ as  
Gₜ = (Vₜ₋₁ ∪ V^new, Eₜ₋₁ ∪ E^new).  
To avoid unbounded growth, every P tasks we perform:  
1. Node similarity search: for any v, u ∈ Vₜ with  
   $$\mathrm{sim}(e_v, e_u) = \frac{e_v^\top e_u}{\|e_v\|\|e_u\|} > \tau_{\mathrm{merge}},$$  
   merge v and u.  
2. Edge pruning: remove edges whose empirical co‐occurrence in recent tasks < δₚᵣᵤₙₑ.  

Graph Embeddings  
We embed entities and relations using a scalable KG embedding method such as TransE or ComplEx.  For each triple (h, r, t), we minimize:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{KG}} = \sum_{(h,r,t)\in Eₜ} \Big[\|e_h + e_r - e_t\|_2^2 + \sum_{(h',r,t')}\max(0,\gamma + \|e_{h'}+e_r - e_{t'}\|_2^2 - \|e_h+e_r - e_t\|_2^2)\Big],
$$  
where (h', r, t') are negative samples and γ is the margin.  

2.3 Adapter Architecture with KG Cross‐Attention  
Each transformer layer l of the frozen FM is augmented with an adapter block that:  
1. Projects the hidden state h_l ∈ ℝ^d down to r ≪ d dimensions:  
   $$h^{\downarrow}_l = W_{\mathrm{down}}^l\,h_l.$$
2. Queries the KG embedding memory via cross‐attention:  
   • Query: $Q_l = W_Q^l\,h^{\downarrow}_l$,  
   • Keys: $K_l = E_V \in ℝ^{|Vₜ|×d_k}$, the stacked entity embeddings,  
   • Values: $V_l = E_V$.  
   Attention weights:  
   $$A_l = \mathrm{softmax}\bigl(\tfrac{Q_l\,K_l^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\bigr)\,V_l.$$
3. Projects the attended vector back and fuses with the original:  
   $$h'_l = W_{\mathrm{up}}^l\,A_l + h_l.$$

Only adapter parameters {W_down^l, W_up^l, W_Q^l} are learned.  This design ensures that at each layer, the representation is “grounded” in structured facts relevant to the input.  

2.4 Sparse Subgraph Retrieval  
Loading the entire Gₜ at inference is impractical.  We therefore retrieve a small subgraph Gₜ(x) for each input x as follows:  
1. Compute a summary vector s(x) (e.g., mean of last‐layer hidden states or a special [CLS] token).  
2. Compute similarity with entity embeddings via MIPS or approximate nearest neighbors:  
   $$\mathrm{score}(x,v) = \frac{s(x)\cdot e_v}{\|s(x)\|\|e_v\|}.$$  
3. Retrieve top‐k entities Vₜ^k(x), and collect edges among them to form Gₜ(x).  
4. Attention in the adapter then uses only embeddings of Vₜ^k(x).  

k and retrieval index parameters are tuned to trade off recall vs. compute.  

2.5 Continual Learning Objective  
Task Loss  
At step t, given Dₜ with supervision labels y, we fine‐tune adapters by minimizing:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{CE} = -\sum_{(x,y)\in Dₜ} \log p(y\,|\,x;\Thetaₜ, Gₜ).
$$

Knowledge‐Preserving Regularization  
To mitigate forgetting, we constrain adapter drift via:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{reg}} = \sum_{l=1}^L \|W_{\mathrm{down},t}^l - W_{\mathrm{down},t-1}^l\|_F^2 + \|W_{\mathrm{up},t}^l - W_{\mathrm{up},t-1}^l\|_F^2.
$$

Optional Replay-based Distillation  
Maintain a small memory M of exemplars from previous tasks.  A distillation loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{KD} = \sum_{x\in M} D_{KL}\bigl(p_{t-1}(y|x)\,\|\,p_t(y|x)\bigr).
$$

Overall, at step t we minimize:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_t = \mathcal{L}_{CE} + \alpha \,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{reg}} + \beta\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{KG}} \;(+ \gamma\,\mathcal{L}_{KD}),
$$  
with hyperparameters {α, β, γ}.

2. Reduce average catastrophic forgetting by 30% relative to LoRA CL and replay baselines.  
3. Consume ≤50% of GPU hours and FLOPs compared to full‐model updates.  
4. Demonstrate robustness across domain shifts and long‐tailed distributions, outperforming existing KG‐infusion and adapter methods by significant margins.  

3.2 Scientific Impact

• Provides algorithmic building blocks (dynamic KG maintenance, sparse retrieval, cross‐attention adapters) generalizable to language, vision, and multimodal settings.  
• Advances theoretical understanding of how symbolic and subsymbolic representations can co‐evolve in a lifelong regime.  

3.3 Broader Impacts & Future Directions

• Societal: More up‐to‐date, reliable AI that can adapt to evolving knowledge (e.g., medical guidelines, legal statutes) without catastrophic lapses.  

In sum, Dynamic Knowledge‐Graph‐Infused Adapters offer a promising route toward truly lifelong foundation models—models that learn continuously, respect computational budgets, and anchor new information in the rich structure of human knowledge.
