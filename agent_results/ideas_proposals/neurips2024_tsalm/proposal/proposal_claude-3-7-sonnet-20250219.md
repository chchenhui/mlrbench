# DynamicFusion: Adaptive Cross-Modal Attention Framework for Enhanced Time Series Forecasting

## Introduction

Time series forecasting is a critical component in numerous domains, including finance, healthcare, energy, and logistics. Traditional time series forecasting models primarily rely on historical numerical data, applying statistical or machine learning algorithms to predict future values. However, these approaches often fail to capture the complex dynamics of real-world systems, particularly during anomalous events, regime changes, or when external factors significantly influence the time series behavior.

In recent years, foundation models have revolutionized machine learning across various domains, particularly in natural language processing and computer vision. These models, pre-trained on vast amounts of diverse data, have demonstrated remarkable abilities to generalize across tasks and domains. This transformation has begun to influence time series analysis, with researchers developing time series foundation models or leveraging pre-trained models from other modalities for forecasting tasks.

While these advancements show promise, a significant gap remains in effectively integrating multimodal information—combining numerical time series data with contextual information from text, images, or categorical metadata—to enhance forecasting accuracy. Real-world time series are often influenced by external events that may be documented in news articles, social media posts, or visual data. For example, consumer spending patterns might be affected by news of economic policy changes, energy consumption could be influenced by weather events visible in satellite imagery, and patient health metrics might correlate with clinical notes or medical images.

Current multimodal approaches face several challenges. The Modality-aware Transformer for Financial Time Series Forecasting (Emami et al., 2023) introduced feature-level attention for integrating categorical text and numerical data but was limited to financial applications. Time-VLM (Zhong et al., 2025) leveraged pre-trained Vision-Language Models but primarily focused on visual-textual integration without fully addressing the dynamic nature of modality importance. MST-GAT (Ding et al., 2023) employed graph attention networks for anomaly detection but did not fully explore forecasting capabilities. The Multi-Modal Forecaster (Kim et al., 2024) attempted joint prediction of time series and text but struggled to outperform existing baselines.

This research proposes DynamicFusion, a novel adaptive cross-modal attention framework that dynamically integrates information from multiple modalities to enhance time series forecasting. Our framework addresses the limitations of existing approaches by introducing:

1. An adaptive modality importance mechanism that dynamically adjusts the influence of each modality based on the forecasting context
2. A hierarchical cross-modal attention architecture that captures both fine-grained feature-level interactions and high-level modality relationships
3. A conditional computation approach that selectively activates relevant components of the model based on data quality and relevance

The objectives of this research are to:
1. Develop a flexible multimodal forecasting architecture that effectively integrates numerical time series with textual, visual, and categorical information
2. Design attention mechanisms capable of dynamically weighting modality importance based on forecasting scenarios
3. Create robust evaluation methodologies that assess performance across standard forecasting conditions and during anomalous events
4. Demonstrate significant performance improvements over unimodal approaches, particularly during regime changes and external shocks

The significance of this research lies in its potential to transform time series forecasting by leveraging the contextual richness provided by multiple modalities. By dynamically fusing information sources, our approach promises more accurate and robust forecasts in complex real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the adaptive nature of our model addresses the challenge of varying data quality and relevance across modalities, a critical consideration in practical applications.

## Methodology

### Overview

The DynamicFusion framework consists of four main components: (1) modality-specific encoders, (2) a hierarchical cross-modal attention module, (3) an adaptive modality importance mechanism, and (4) a time series decoder. Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of our proposed framework.

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

We will collect multimodal time series datasets from three domains:
1. **Financial forecasting**: Stock price data paired with financial news articles and social media sentiment
2. **Energy consumption**: Electricity load data paired with weather reports, satellite imagery, and event calendars
3. **Healthcare monitoring**: Patient vital signs paired with clinical notes and medical test results

For each dataset, we will ensure temporal alignment between the time series and associated multimodal data. Preprocessing steps include:

1. **Time series data**: Normalization, missing value imputation, and temporal feature extraction
2. **Text data**: Tokenization, filtering, and embedding generation using pre-trained language models
3. **Image data**: Resizing, normalization, and feature extraction using pre-trained vision models
4. **Categorical data**: One-hot encoding or embedding generation

### Modality-Specific Encoders

Each modality is processed by a specialized encoder:

1. **Time Series Encoder**: A temporal convolutional network (TCN) combined with a transformer encoder captures both local and global temporal patterns.

$$E_{ts} = \text{Transformer}(\text{TCN}(X_{ts}))$$

Where $X_{ts} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times F}$ represents the time series input with $T$ time steps and $F$ features.

2. **Text Encoder**: We leverage a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to encode textual information.

$$E_{text} = \text{TextEncoder}(X_{text})$$

Where $X_{text}$ represents the textual input associated with the time series.

3. **Image Encoder**: A pre-trained vision model (e.g., ViT, ResNet) extracts features from image data.

$$E_{img} = \text{ImageEncoder}(X_{img})$$

Where $X_{img}$ represents the image input associated with the time series.

4. **Categorical Encoder**: An embedding layer converts categorical features into dense representations.

$$E_{cat} = \text{Embedding}(X_{cat})$$

Where $X_{cat}$ represents categorical features associated with the time series.

### Hierarchical Cross-Modal Attention Module

The hierarchical cross-modal attention module operates at two levels:

1. **Feature-Level Cross-Attention**: This captures fine-grained interactions between features across modalities. For each pair of modalities $(i, j)$, we compute:

$$A_{ij} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_i K_j^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)$$
$$Z_{ij} = A_{ij} V_j$$

Where $Q_i = E_i W_i^Q$, $K_j = E_j W_j^K$, and $V_j = E_j W_j^V$ are the query, key, and value projections for modalities $i$ and $j$, respectively.

2. **Modality-Level Attention**: This captures high-level relationships between modalities. We compute:

$$\alpha = \text{softmax}(W_{\alpha} \cdot [E_{ts}, E_{text}, E_{img}, E_{cat}] + b_{\alpha})$$

Where $\alpha$ represents the importance weights for each modality, and $[E_{ts}, E_{text}, E_{img}, E_{cat}]$ denotes the concatenation of modality embeddings.

### Adaptive Modality Importance Mechanism

The core innovation of our approach is the adaptive modality importance mechanism that dynamically adjusts the influence of each modality based on the forecasting context. This mechanism consists of:

1. **Context-Aware Importance Estimator**: This component analyzes the current time series context to estimate the potential importance of each modality.

$$C_t = \text{ContextEncoder}(X_{ts}[t-k:t])$$
$$I_t = \sigma(W_I \cdot C_t + b_I)$$

Where $C_t$ represents the encoded context at time $t$, and $I_t \in \mathbb{R}^M$ represents the estimated importance of each of the $M$ modalities.

2. **Data Quality Assessor**: This component evaluates the quality and reliability of data from each modality.

$$Q_t = [q_{ts}, q_{text}, q_{img}, q_{cat}]$$

Where $q_i$ represents the quality score for modality $i$, computed based on completeness, recency, and reliability metrics.

3. **Dynamic Weight Computation**: The final modality weights are computed by combining the context-based importance and data quality scores.

$$w_t = \text{softmax}(I_t \odot Q_t)$$

Where $\odot$ represents element-wise multiplication.

### Time Series Decoder

The decoder fuses the multimodal representations and generates the forecast:

1. **Multimodal Fusion**: The modality-specific representations are combined using the dynamic weights.

$$Z_t = \sum_{i=1}^M w_{t,i} \cdot Z_i$$

Where $Z_i$ represents the representation of modality $i$ after the cross-attention module.

2. **Forecast Generation**: The fused representation is fed into a decoder to generate the forecast.

$$\hat{y}_{t+1:t+h} = \text{Decoder}(Z_t)$$

Where $\hat{y}_{t+1:t+h}$ represents the predicted time series values for the next $h$ time steps.

### Training and Optimization

We employ a multi-task learning approach with the following loss function:

$$\mathcal{L} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{forecast} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{reconstruct} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{reg}$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{forecast}$ is the forecasting loss, typically mean squared error (MSE) or quantile loss for probabilistic forecasting
- $\mathcal{L}_{reconstruct}$ is a reconstruction loss that encourages the model to preserve information from each modality
- $\mathcal{L}_{reg}$ is a regularization term that promotes sparsity in the attention weights

The model is trained end-to-end using the Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling. We employ gradient clipping to stabilize training and dropout for regularization.

### Experimental Design

We will conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of our DynamicFusion framework across three dimensions:

1. **Forecasting Accuracy**: We compare our approach against both traditional time series models (ARIMA, Prophet, DeepAR) and recent multimodal approaches (Modality-aware Transformer, Time-VLM, Multi-Modal Forecaster).

2. **Robustness to Anomalies**: We evaluate performance during anomalous periods and regime changes, using both real-world events and synthetic anomalies injected into the test data.

3. **Ablation Studies**: We analyze the contribution of each component by systematically removing or simplifying parts of the architecture.

#### Evaluation Metrics

We will employ the following metrics to assess forecasting performance:

1. **Point Forecast Accuracy**:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

2. **Probabilistic Forecast Accuracy**:
   - Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)
   - Interval Coverage Rate
   - Prediction Interval Width

3. **Anomaly Detection Performance**:
   - F1 Score for detecting anomalous periods
   - Lead Time (how early the model can detect upcoming anomalies)

4. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - Training time
   - Inference time
   - Memory usage

#### Experimental Protocol

1. **Dataset Splitting**: For each dataset, we will use a 70%/15%/15% split for training, validation, and testing, ensuring that the test set includes periods with known anomalies or regime changes.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: We will use Bayesian optimization to tune hyperparameters on the validation set.

3. **Statistical Significance**: We will conduct statistical significance tests (paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) to verify that improvements over baseline models are statistically significant.

4. **Model Interpretability Analysis**: We will analyze the learned attention weights to understand how the model integrates information from different modalities and how these weights change during different forecasting scenarios.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Enhanced Forecasting Accuracy**: We expect DynamicFusion to demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to unimodal approaches and existing multimodal methods, particularly during anomalous periods and regime changes. We anticipate a 15-20% reduction in forecasting error metrics (MAE, RMSE) during normal periods and a 30-40% reduction during anomalous periods.

2. **Dynamic Modality Utilization**: Our framework will automatically adjust the influence of each modality based on the forecasting context, data quality, and relevance. We expect to observe patterns in modality importance that align with domain knowledge, such as increased reliance on news text during financial market volatility or greater weight on weather imagery during seasonal transitions in energy consumption.

3. **Improved Anomaly Detection**: By leveraging multimodal information, our approach should improve the detection of upcoming anomalies, providing earlier warnings and more accurate characterizations of anomalous behavior. We anticipate improvements in both the F1 score for anomaly detection and the lead time for early warnings.

4. **Interpretable Forecasting**: The attention mechanisms in our framework will provide insights into which modalities and features contribute most to specific forecasts, enhancing model interpretability and trustworthiness.

5. **Generalizable Architecture**: We expect our framework to demonstrate strong performance across multiple domains, showcasing its flexibility and adaptability to different types of time series and auxiliary information.

### Impact

3. **Methodological Contribution**: Our hierarchical cross-modal attention architecture and adaptive modality importance mechanism provide a blueprint for developing more flexible and context-aware multimodal models. These methodological innovations could be applied to other time series tasks beyond forecasting, such as classification, anomaly detection, and causal analysis.

4. **Foundation Model Integration**: By demonstrating effective ways to leverage pre-trained foundation models for time series tasks, our research contributes to the growing body of work exploring cross-modal transfer learning. This aligns with the broader trend toward developing versatile foundation models that can be adapted to diverse downstream tasks.
