**1. Title:** **Adaptive Multimodal Attention Fusion (AMAF) for Enhanced Robustness and Interpretability in Time Series Forecasting**

**2. Introduction**

*   **Background:**
    Time series forecasting is a critical task across numerous domains, including finance, energy, healthcare, and climate science. Traditional forecasting models, ranging from statistical methods (ARIMA, ETS) to modern deep learning approaches (RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers), predominantly rely on historical numerical sequences. While effective under stable conditions, these models often falter during periods of high volatility, regime shifts, or anomalous events (e.g., market crashes triggered by news, energy demand spikes due to weather events reported online, patient health deterioration indicated by clinical notes). This limitation stems from their inability to incorporate rich contextual information available in other modalities, such as text (news articles, social media posts, reports), images (satellite imagery, medical scans), or structured metadata (product categories, event logs). Such external information often contains leading indicators or explanatory factors crucial for understanding and anticipating shifts in time series dynamics.

    The recent success of foundation models in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), exemplified by large pre-trained transformers like BERT, GPT, and Vision Transformers (ViT), presents a transformative opportunity for time series analysis. These models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in extracting meaningful representations from vast, unstructured data. Leveraging these advancements, the time series community is increasingly exploring how to integrate multimodal information and adapt pre-trained models to enhance forecasting performance [2, 4]. Early efforts have shown promise in using text or visual data alongside numerical sequences [1, 2], but significant challenges remain. Effectively fusing heterogeneous data streams, designing attention mechanisms that dynamically prioritize informative modalities [3], ensuring robustness, maintaining interpretability [3], and managing computational costs [5] are active areas of research. Specifically, existing multimodal approaches often use static fusion strategies or basic attention mechanisms that may not optimally adapt to dynamically changing data relevance or quality, particularly during critical events.

*   **Research Objectives:**
    This research aims to develop and evaluate a novel multimodal time series forecasting framework, Adaptive Multimodal Attention Fusion (AMAF), designed to systematically integrate numerical time series data with relevant contextual information from textual and potentially other modalities (e.g., categorical metadata). The primary goal is to significantly improve forecasting accuracy and robustness, particularly during periods influenced by external factors, while providing insights into the interplay between different modalities.

    The specific objectives are:
    1.  **Develop Modality-Specific Encoders:** Design and implement robust encoders for each data modality, leveraging pre-trained foundation models where appropriate (e.g., time series transformers for numerical data, BERT/RoBERTa for text) to capture rich intra-modal representations.
    2.  **Design a Novel Cross-Modal Attention Fusion Mechanism:** Create a sophisticated cross-modal attention module that enables bidirectional information flow between modalities, allowing the model to learn context-aware inter-modal dependencies.
    3.  **Implement an Adaptive Modality Weighting Scheme:** Develop a dynamic gating or weighting mechanism that automatically adjusts the influence of each modality's representation based on its predicted relevance and reliability for the current forecasting step or context.
    4.  **Comprehensive Empirical Validation:** Rigorously evaluate AMAF's performance against state-of-the-art unimodal and existing multimodal forecasting baselines on diverse benchmark datasets, focusing on both overall accuracy and performance during identified events or regime shifts.
    5.  **Analyze Model Interpretability and Robustness:** Investigate the model's behavior through attention visualization and ablation studies to understand how different modalities contribute to predictions, particularly during critical periods, and assess its robustness to noisy or missing modal inputs.

*   **Significance:**
    This research directly addresses several key topics highlighted by the "Workshop on Time Series in the Age of Large Models," including building multimodal time series models, leveraging pretrained models from other modalities, analyzing model behavior, and real-world applications. By proposing a sophisticated fusion mechanism with adaptive weighting, AMAF aims to overcome limitations of existing approaches, such as static fusion or simpler attention schemes [1, 4]. Improved forecasting accuracy, especially during critical events, has significant practical implications in domains like finance (risk management), energy (grid stability), retail (demand planning), and healthcare (patient monitoring). Furthermore, the investigation into adaptive weighting and attention patterns will contribute to a better understanding of how multimodal information interacts in complex systems, addressing the challenge of interpretability in large time series models [3]. Successfully developing AMAF would provide a powerful and potentially more reliable framework for time series forecasting in complex, real-world scenarios characterized by heterogeneous data streams and dynamic environments, pushing the frontier of time series research in the era of large models.

**3. Methodology**

This section outlines the proposed research design, including data collection and preprocessing, the AMAF model architecture with its core components, the training procedure, and the experimental validation plan.

*   **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
    We will utilize publicly available datasets and potentially create semi-synthetic benchmarks to ensure comprehensive evaluation. Suitable datasets should ideally contain time-aligned numerical time series and corresponding contextual data (primarily text, potentially categorical metadata).
    1.  **Candidate Datasets:**
        *   **Financial:** Stock prices (e.g., S&P 500 components) aligned with financial news headlines (e.g., from Reuters, Bloomberg) or sentiment scores derived from social media (e.g., Twitter). Datasets like the one used in [1] could be considered.
        *   **Energy:** Electricity load or renewable energy generation data aligned with weather reports (textual summaries) or significant events (e.g., policy changes, grid failures) reported in news.
        *   **Retail:** Sales data for specific products aligned with marketing campaigns (metadata), social media trends (text), or competitor actions (news).
        *   **Healthcare:** Patient vital signs (numerical TS) aligned with clinical notes (text) or documented interventions (categorical). The TimeText Corpus (TTC) [4] could be a valuable resource if accessible and suitable.
        *   **Synthetic/Semi-Synthetic:** If suitable real-world aligned data is scarce, particularly data with clear event markers, we will explore generating semi-synthetic datasets. This could involve using existing time series benchmarks (e.g., ETT, Weather, M4/M5) and injecting realistic anomalies or regime shifts correlated with synthetically generated or real-world text snippets describing hypothetical events.
    2.  **Preprocessing:**
        *   **Numerical Data:** Standard scaling (e.g., Z-score normalization) or min-max scaling will be applied per time series. Techniques like patching [As in PatchTST] might be used to create input tokens.
        *   **Textual Data:** Text will be tokenized using appropriate tokenizers (e.g., WordPiece for BERT). Input sequences will be padded or truncated to a fixed maximum length. Pre-trained embeddings or fine-tuned embeddings from models like BERT or RoBERTa will be generated.
        *   **Categorical Data:** Categorical metadata (if used) will be converted into learnable embeddings.
        *   **Alignment:** Ensuring proper temporal alignment between the numerical time series points and the corresponding contextual data (e.g., news published within a relevant time window before the forecast point) is crucial. We will define clear alignment protocols based on timestamps or event occurrences. Missing data across modalities will be handled using appropriate imputation techniques (e.g., forward fill for TS, special tokens for text) or by designing the model to be robust to missing modalities (potentially informed by the adaptive weighting).

*   **Model Architecture: Adaptive Multimodal Attention Fusion (AMAF):**
    The AMAF model consists of three main stages: Modality-Specific Encoding, Cross-Modal Attention Fusion with Adaptive Weighting, and a Forecasting Head.

    1.  **Modality-Specific Encoders:**
        *   **Numerical Encoder ($E_{num}$):** We will employ a state-of-the-art time series Transformer architecture, such as PatchTST, which patches the input time series and uses a standard Transformer encoder. Input: $X_{num} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times D_{num}}$ (L: lookback window, $D_{num}$: number of numerical variates). Output: $H_{num} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_p \times d_{model}}$ ( $N_p$: number of patches, $d_{model}$: embedding dimension).
            $$ H^{l}_{num} = \text{TransformerEncoderLayer}(H^{l-1}_{num}) $$
            where $H^0_{num}$ are the initial patch embeddings.
        *   **Text Encoder ($E_{text}$):** We will utilize a pre-trained Transformer-based language model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Depending on computational constraints and performance trade-offs, we might use frozen embeddings from the last layer or fine-tune the entire model. Input: $X_{text}$ (tokenized text sequences). Output: $H_{text} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_t \times d_{model}}$ ( $N_t$: number of text tokens, $d_{model}$: embedding dimension, potentially using the [CLS] token representation or mean-pooling over token embeddings).
            $$ H_{text} = \text{PreTrainedLM}(X_{text}) $$
        *   **Categorical Encoder ($E_{cat}$ - Optional):** If relevant categorical metadata $X_{cat}$ is available, simple embedding layers will be used. Output: $H_{cat} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_c \times d_{model}}$ ( $N_c$: number of categorical features).

    2.  **Cross-Modal Attention Fusion and Adaptive Weighting:** This is the core innovation. It aims to dynamically integrate information from the different modalities.
        *   **Cross-Modal Attention:** We propose using multiple layers of multi-head cross-attention. For instance, to allow the numerical representation to incorporate textual context, we compute:
            $$ \tilde{H}_{num} = \text{LayerNorm}(H_{num} + \text{MultiHeadCrossAttn}(Q=H_{num}, K=H_{text}, V=H_{text})) $$
            Similarly, textual representation can be enriched with numerical context:
            $$ \tilde{H}_{text} = \text{LayerNorm}(H_{text} + \text{MultiHeadCrossAttn}(Q=H_{text}, K=H_{num}, V=H_{num})) $$
            where $\text{MultiHeadCrossAttn}(Q, K, V)$ follows the standard definition using scaled dot-product attention. Multiple such layers can be stacked, potentially followed by modality-specific feed-forward networks.
        *   **Adaptive Modality Weighting:** After cross-modal interactions (producing refined representations $\tilde{H}_{num}, \tilde{H}_{text}, ...$), we introduce an adaptive mechanism to weigh their importance before final fusion. We propose a gating mechanism conditioned on the representations themselves. For example, using a shared representation (e.g., mean-pooled $\tilde{H}_{num}$ and $\tilde{H}_{text}$ [CLS] token) passed through a small neural network with a softmax output to generate weights $\alpha_{num}, \alpha_{text}, ...$ such that $\sum \alpha_i = 1$.
            $$ [\text{pooled}(\tilde{H}_{num}); \text{pooled}(\tilde{H}_{text})] \rightarrow \text{MLP} \rightarrow [\alpha_{num}, \alpha_{text}] = \text{softmax}(z) $$
            Alternatively, feature-level gating could be explored. These weights determine the contribution of each modality to the final fused representation.
        *   **Final Fusion:** The adaptively weighted representations are combined. A simple concatenation followed by a linear layer, or a weighted sum based on the computed $\alpha$ values:
            $$ H_{fused} = \text{Combine}([\alpha_{num} \cdot f_{num}(\tilde{H}_{num}), \alpha_{text} \cdot f_{text}(\tilde{H}_{text}), ...]) $$
            where $f(\cdot)$ might be a pooling or reshaping function to ensure compatible dimensions for combination (e.g., taking the first token/patch embedding or mean pooling).

    3.  **Forecasting Head ($F_{head}$):** A simple feed-forward neural network (e.g., a 2-layer MLP with ReLU activation) takes the fused representation $H_{fused}$ and projects it to the desired forecast horizon H.
        $$ \hat{Y} = \text{MLP}(H_{fused}) \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times D_{target}} $$
        where $D_{target}$ is the number of target variables to forecast.

*   **Training Procedure:**
    *   **Loss Function:** Primarily Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for point forecasting.
        $$ \mathcal{L}_{MSE} = \frac{1}{H \cdot D_{target}} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \sum_{d=1}^{D_{target}} (Y_{h,d} - \hat{Y}_{h,d})^2 $$
        We may also explore probabilistic forecasting by modifying the head to output distribution parameters (e.g., mean and variance for a Gaussian distribution) and using appropriate losses like Negative Log-Likelihood or Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS).
    *   **Optimization:** AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule (e.g., cosine annealing with warmup).
    *   **Regularization:** Dropout within MLP layers and attention mechanisms, potentially weight decay. Early stopping based on validation loss will be used.
    *   **Training Strategy:** End-to-end training is preferred. However, if computationally challenging, a staged approach could be considered (e.g., pre-train/fine-tune encoders first, then train the fusion module and head). Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., LoRA) might be applied to the pre-trained LM encoder to reduce computational burden.

*   **Experimental Design and Evaluation:**
    1.  **Baselines:** We will compare AMAF against:
        *   *Unimodal SOTA:* PatchTST, DLinear, N-BEATS (using only numerical data).
        *   *Simple Multimodal:* Concatenation of embeddings from modality-specific encoders fed into a standard forecasting model (e.g., Transformer or MLP).
        *   *Existing Multimodal Models:* Implementations or reported results of relevant models from the literature, such as concepts from the Modality-aware Transformer [1] or Time-VLM [2] if feasible within the scope.
    2.  **Datasets:** Evaluation will be performed on the collected datasets (financial, energy, retail, etc.). We will specifically identify subsets or time periods within these datasets that correspond to known external events, anomalies, or regime shifts to allow for targeted evaluation of robustness.
    3.  **Evaluation Metrics:**
        *   *Standard Accuracy:* MAE, MSE, Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).
        *   *Robustness Metrics:* Performance metrics calculated specifically during event periods vs. normal periods. We might define custom metrics like "Event Performance Ratio" (accuracy during event / accuracy during normal).
        *   *Probabilistic Metrics (if applicable):* CRPS, Pinball Loss for quantile forecasts.
        *   *Computational Cost:* Training time, inference latency, model parameter count.
    4.  **Ablation Studies:** To validate the contribution of each component:
        *   *Modality Contribution:* Train AMAF using only numerical data, only text data (if meaningful), and combinations to quantify the benefit of multimodality.
        *   *Fusion Mechanism:* Compare the proposed cross-modal attention + adaptive weighting against simpler fusion methods (concatenation, simple averaging, cross-attention without adaptive weights, adaptive weights without cross-attention).
        *   *Encoder Choice:* Compare the effect of using pre-trained vs. randomly initialized encoders (especially for text).
        *   *Adaptive Weighting Analysis:* Analyze the learned weights ($\alpha_i$) over time, especially around events, to understand if the model dynamically adjusts modality importance as expected.
    5.  **Interpretability Analysis:** Visualize cross-modal attention weights to understand which parts of the text/metadata are attended to when forecasting specific numerical patterns. Analyze the adaptive modality weights ($\alpha_i$) to see which modality is deemed more important under different conditions (e.g., stable vs. volatile periods).

**4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**

*   **Expected Outcomes:**
    1.  **Superior Forecasting Performance:** We expect AMAF to outperform state-of-the-art unimodal and existing multimodal baselines in terms of standard forecasting accuracy metrics (MAE, MSE) across diverse datasets.
    2.  **Enhanced Robustness:** A key anticipated outcome is significantly improved performance during periods marked by external events, anomalies, or regime shifts, demonstrating the value of contextual multimodal information fused adaptively. This will be validated through targeted evaluation on specific data segments.
    3.  **Effective Fusion Mechanism:** Ablation studies are expected to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed cross-modal attention and adaptive weighting scheme compared to simpler fusion approaches.
    4.  **Interpretability Insights:** Analysis of attention weights and adaptive modality weights ($\alpha_i$) will provide valuable insights into how the model leverages different modalities and how their perceived importance changes dynamically, contributing to understanding the "black box" nature of large models in this context.
    5.  **Open-Source Contribution:** We plan to release the code implementation of AMAF and potentially curated multimodal benchmark splits to facilitate reproducibility and further research by the community.

    This research has the potential to make significant contributions to the field of time series analysis in the age of large models:
    1.  **Advancement of Multimodal Time Series:** Provides a novel, robust, and adaptive architecture for integrating diverse data sources, pushing the capabilities of multimodal forecasting beyond existing methods.
    2.  **Improved Real-World Applications:** Offers a practical tool for enhancing forecasting accuracy and reliability in critical domains (finance, energy, healthcare, etc.) where external context is crucial but often underutilized. This directly addresses the workshop's interest in real-world applications.
    3.  **Understanding Large Model Integration:** Contributes to understanding how to effectively leverage large pre-trained models (like LLMs) for time series tasks and how to design mechanisms for intelligent fusion of information from different modalities.
    4.  **Addressing Key Challenges:** Directly tackles highlighted challenges such as modality integration complexity, attention mechanism design, and model interpretability in the context of large time series models.
