# Calibrated Pseudo-Ensembles: Efficient Uncertainty Quantification for Foundation Models

## Motivation
Large language models frequently produce incorrect information with high confidence, creating significant risk in high-stakes applications. Current uncertainty quantification methods often require multiple forward passes or model ensembles, making them computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter foundation models. We need scalable uncertainty estimation methods that can reliably flag potential hallucinations without sacrificing the computational efficiency necessary for practical deployment in real-world systems.

## Main Idea
We propose Calibrated Pseudo-Ensembles (CPE), a lightweight approach for uncertainty quantification in foundation models that approximates the behavior of model ensembles without their computational burden. The method involves adding a specialized uncertainty head to the model that is trained to predict the variance in outputs that would be observed across an ensemble. During training, we create synthetic ensemble variability through techniques like dropout, data augmentation, and parameter perturbation. This variability is calibrated against actual ensemble disagreement on a subset of examples. At inference time, CPE produces both the standard model output and an uncertainty score with minimal computational overhead. The approach can be applied to existing deployed models through a parameter-efficient fine-tuning process, making it practical for immediate implementation in production environments while providing reliable signals to distinguish between factual responses and potential hallucinations.
