## 1. Title: Proactive Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models via Uncertainty-Aware Decoding

## 2. Introduction

**Background:** Large Language Models (LLMs) and other foundation models represent a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning across diverse domains (Brown et al., 2020). Their increasing integration into critical applications such as healthcare diagnostics (Thirunavukarasu et al., 2023), legal analysis (Choi et al., 2023), and financial forecasting (Wu et al., 2023) underscores their potential societal impact. However, the widespread adoption of these powerful models is significantly hampered by inherent reliability issues, most notably their propensity to "hallucinate" – generating fluent, confident-sounding text that is factually incorrect, nonsensical, or untethered to the provided context (Ji et al., 2023). These hallucinations erode user trust and pose substantial risks, particularly in high-stakes scenarios where misinformation can lead to detrimental consequences.

The challenge of ensuring the reliability of foundation models motivates the critical need for robust Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques. As highlighted by the workshop "Quantify Uncertainty and Hallucination in Foundation Models: The Next Frontier in Reliable AI," UQ provides a necessary measure of a model's confidence in its own outputs. This allows users, developers, and decision-making systems to discern when an LLM's generation is likely trustworthy and when caution or human intervention is required. While various UQ methods, such as those based on model ensembles or Bayesian approximations like Monte Carlo (MC) dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016), have been explored, their application to the scale and autoregressive nature of modern LLMs presents unique challenges. Furthermore, much existing work focuses on post-hoc detection of potential issues (Manakul et al., 2023), which fails to prevent the generation of erroneous content in the first place.

**Problem Statement:** Current approaches to mitigating hallucinations in LLMs often rely on external fact-checking mechanisms applied *after* generation or complex fine-tuning strategies requiring substantial annotated data (Tian et al., 2023). While valuable, post-hoc methods are reactive, computationally expensive, and may not scale effectively. Fine-tuning, while potentially improving factual accuracy on specific tasks, can be brittle and may not generalize well, potentially diminishing the models' general capabilities or requiring constant updates. There is a pressing need for methods that can proactively identify and mitigate the risk of hallucination *during* the text generation process itself, leveraging the model's intrinsic signals of uncertainty.

**Proposed Solution:** This research proposes an **Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD)** framework designed to be integrated directly into the autoregressive generation loop of LLMs. The core idea is to monitor token-level uncertainty at each decoding step using computationally viable UQ metrics. When the uncertainty associated with potential next tokens or sequences surpasses a dynamically calibrated threshold – signaling an increased likelihood of deviating from factual grounding or coherent reasoning – the UAD module actively intervenes in the decoding process. These interventions are designed to steer the generation towards more reliable outputs, potentially by constraining the sampling space, re-ranking token probabilities based on uncertainty, or explicitly signaling low confidence.

**Research Objectives:** This research aims to achieve the following objectives:
1.  **Develop and Implement the UAD Framework:** Formalize and implement the UAD framework, integrating various token-level UQ estimation techniques (e.g., predictive entropy, MC dropout variance, lightweight ensemble disagreement) within the decoding loop of pre-trained LLMs.
2.  **Investigate Intervention Strategies:** Design, implement, and evaluate different intervention mechanisms triggered by high uncertainty, including:
    *   Constraining token sampling based on retrieved factual evidence.
    *   Re-ranking candidate tokens to prioritize lower-uncertainty options.
    *   Injecting specific tokens to signal potential unreliability to the user or downstream systems.
3.  **Evaluate Effectiveness on Factual Tasks:** Quantitatively assess the ability of UAD to mitigate hallucinations on benchmark datasets focused on factual accuracy (e.g., question answering, fact-based summarization). Measure the reduction in hallucination rates compared to standard decoding baselines.
4.  **Analyze Trade-offs:** Evaluate the impact of UAD on generation quality (fluency, coherence, relevance), computational overhead (latency, memory), and uncertainty calibration. Analyze the trade-off between hallucination reduction and potential impacts on creativity or task performance.
5.  **Explore Threshold Calibration:** Investigate methods for setting and dynamically adjusting the uncertainty threshold for intervention, aiming to optimize the balance between safety and utility.

**Significance:** This research directly addresses the critical challenge of hallucination and reliability in LLMs, a key bottleneck for their trustworthy deployment. By developing a proactive, *in-process* mitigation strategy, UAD offers a potentially more efficient and effective alternative to purely post-hoc methods. Successful development and validation of UAD would:
*   Enhance the factual reliability and trustworthiness of LLM outputs.
*   Provide a mechanism for safer deployment in high-stakes domains by flagging or correcting potentially erroneous generations.
*   Contribute novel insights into UQ methods specifically tailored for large-scale autoregressive models.
*   Offer practical guidance on balancing uncertainty mitigation with generation quality and efficiency, addressing key challenges identified in the literature (e.g., computational overhead, threshold calibration, evaluation metrics).
*   Provide a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners seeking to build more dependable AI systems.

## 3. Methodology

This section details the proposed research design, including UQ techniques, the UAD algorithm, data, experimental setup, and evaluation metrics.

**3.1 Foundational Concepts: Uncertainty Quantification Metrics**

We will focus on token-level uncertainty estimation during autoregressive generation. At each timestep $t$, given the input prompt $x$ and the previously generated sequence $y_{<t}$, the LLM outputs a probability distribution $P(y_t | y_{<t}, x)$ over the next token vocabulary $W$. We will investigate several computationally feasible UQ metrics to quantify the uncertainty in this prediction:

1.  **Predictive Entropy:** Measures the diffuseness of the probability distribution over the next token. Higher entropy indicates greater uncertainty.
    $$ H(P(y_t | y_{<t}, x)) = - \sum_{w_i \in W} P(y_t=w_i | y_{<t}, x) \log_2 P(y_t=w_i | y_{<t}, x) $$
2.  **Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout Variance:** Treats dropout as a Bayesian approximation (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016). We perform $K$ stochastic forward passes with dropout enabled at inference time to obtain $K$ predictive distributions $\{P_k(y_t | y_{<t}, x)\}_{k=1}^K$. Uncertainty can be estimated as the variance of probabilities for high-likelihood tokens or the variance of the logits across these passes. For a specific token $w_i$:
    $$ \text{Var}_{\text{MC}}(P(y_t=w_i)) \approx \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K (P_k(y_t=w_i) - \bar{P}(y_t=w_i))^2 $$
    where $\bar{P}(y_t=w_i) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K P_k(y_t=w_i)$. This requires multiple forward passes, increasing computation, so efficiency trade-offs will be key.
3.  **Lightweight Ensemble Disagreement:** Instead of full model ensembling, we explore computationally cheaper alternatives. This could involve ensembling only the final layers, using snapshot ensembles, or techniques like Multi-Head Attention dropout patterns to simulate diverse models. Disagreement can be measured using metrics like the variance of token probabilities across ensemble members or the average Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between member distributions and the mean distribution.
    $$ D_{\text{KL}}(\{P_k\}_{k=1}^M || \bar{P}) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{k=1}^M KL(P_k(y_t | y_{<t}, x) || \bar{P}(y_t | y_{<t}, x)) $$
    where $M$ is the number of ensemble members and $\bar{P}$ is the average predictive distribution.

**3.2 Proposed Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD) Framework**

The UAD framework modifies the standard autoregressive decoding process (e.g., greedy search, nucleus sampling, top-k sampling).

**Algorithm Outline:**

1.  **Initialization:** Given an input prompt $x$, select a base LLM $M$, a UQ estimation method $U$, an intervention strategy $I$, and an uncertainty threshold $\tau$ (potentially dynamic). Initialize the generated sequence $y = []$.
2.  **Autoregressive Loop:** For $t = 1$ to $T_{max}$ (max sequence length):
    a.  **Predict Next Token Distribution:** Obtain the probability distribution $P_t = P(y_t | y_{<t}, x)$ from model $M$.
    b.  **Estimate Uncertainty:** Calculate the uncertainty score $u_t = U(P_t)$ using the chosen UQ method (e.g., entropy, MC variance, ensemble disagreement).
    c.  **Threshold Check:** Compare $u_t$ with the threshold $\tau_t$. The threshold $\tau_t$ may be fixed or dynamically adjusted (e.g., based on recent uncertainty levels, position in sequence, or external context).
    d.  **Apply Intervention (if $u_t > \tau_t$):**
        i.  Execute the chosen intervention strategy $I$. This modifies the decoding process for the current step $t$. Options include:
            *   **Constraint via Retrieval (If Applicable):** Retrieve relevant factual snippets $F$ based on $x$ and $y_{<t}$. Modify $P_t$ to strongly favor tokens $w_i$ consistent with $F$, potentially masking inconsistent tokens. Requires an external knowledge source and retriever.
            *   **Uncertainty-Based Re-ranking:** Adjust the logits or probabilities in $P_t$ to penalize high-uncertainty options or favour lower-uncertainty ones within the candidate set (e.g., top-k or nucleus set). A simple heuristic could be: $logit'(w_i) = logit(w_i) - \lambda \cdot U(w_i)$, where $U(w_i)$ might be token-specific uncertainty if available (e.g., variance from MC dropout for that token) and $\lambda$ is a scaling factor.
            *   **Inject Warning Token:** If a reliable token cannot be selected, insert a special token (e.g., `[POTENTIALLY_UNCERTAIN]` or `[FACT_CHECK_NEEDED]`) into the sequence $y$, potentially altering $P_t$ to favour this token, and proceed to the next step or pause generation.
    e.  **Sample Next Token:** Apply the base decoding strategy (e.g., nucleus sampling, greedy) to the (potentially modified) distribution $P_t$ to select the next token $y_t$.
    f.  **Append Token:** Append $y_t$ to the sequence $y$.
    g.  **Check Termination:** If $y_t$ is an end-of-sequence token, break the loop.
3.  **Output:** Return the generated sequence $y$.

**3.3 Data Collection and Datasets**

We will evaluate UAD primarily on tasks where factual accuracy is paramount and hallucinations are problematic. We will utilize established benchmarks:

*   **Question Answering (QA):**
    *   **Natural Questions (NQ)** (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019): Requires answering questions based on Wikipedia articles. Focus on abstractive QA settings.
    *   **TruthfulQA** (Lin et al., 2022): Designed specifically to measure truthfulness and susceptibility to generating imitative falsehoods.
*   **Fact-Based Summarization:**
    *   **XSum** (Narayan et al., 2018): Requires generating highly abstractive single-sentence summaries from news articles. Prone to factual inconsistencies.
    *   **CNN/Daily Mail (CNN/DM)** (Hermann et al., 2015): Abstractive summarization requiring faithfulness to the source article.
*   **Knowledge-Intensive Generation:** Tasks requiring generation grounded in specific knowledge, potentially using datasets like ELI5 (Explain Like I'm Five) (Fan et al., 2019).

For evaluation, we will need the source documents/contexts alongside reference answers/summaries to assess factual consistency. The implementation of the "Constraint via Retrieval" intervention will require setting up a retrieval pipeline (e.g., using Dense Passage Retrieval - Karpukhin et al., 2020) over the relevant knowledge corpus (e.g., Wikipedia for NQ).

**3.4 Experimental Design**

Our experiments will be designed to rigorously evaluate UAD and compare different configurations.

*   **Models:** We will use publicly available pre-trained LLMs of varying sizes (e.g., Llama 2 family - Touvron et al., 2023; Mistral models - Jiang et al., 2023) to assess the scalability and generalizability of UAD.
*   **Baselines:** We will compare UAD against:
    *   Standard decoding methods: Greedy search, Nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020), Top-k sampling.
    *   Post-hoc filtering: Generating candidates and filtering them based on uncertainty scores or external fact-checkers.
    *   Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) without UAD (Lewis et al., 2020) for relevant comparisons.
*   **Comparative Analyses:**
    *   **UQ Methods:** We will implement UAD with different UQ estimators (Entropy, MC Dropout, Ensembles) and compare their effectiveness in triggering useful interventions vs. their computational cost.
    *   **Intervention Strategies:** We will compare the performance of the different intervention mechanisms (Constraint, Re-ranking, Warning Token) in terms of hallucination reduction and impact on generation quality.
    *   **Threshold Sensitivity:** We will systematically vary the uncertainty threshold $\tau$ (both fixed values and dynamic strategies based on percentile validation or running statistics) and analyze its impact on the trade-off between hallucination mitigation and text quality/utility.
*   **Ablation Studies:** We will perform ablation studies by removing components of the UAD framework (e.g., remove intervention but keep monitoring, use only retrieval without uncertainty) to understand the contribution of each part.

**3.5 Evaluation Metrics**

We will use a combination of automatic and human evaluation metrics:

*   **Hallucination / Factual Consistency:**
    *   **Automatic Fact-Checking:** Use tools like FactScore (Min et al., 2023) or QA-based metrics (e.g., QAFactEval - Fabbri et al., 2022) that verify generated statements against source documents or reference facts. Report metrics like precision, recall, F1-score of factual statements.
    *   **NLI-based Metrics:** Use Natural Language Inference models to assess entailment/contradiction between generated text and source context (Honovich et al., 2022).
    *   **Human Evaluation:** Conduct evaluations where human annotators rate the factual accuracy and identify specific hallucinations in generated outputs (using Likert scales or binary judgments).
*   **Generation Quality:**
    *   **Fluency/Coherence:** Automatic metrics (e.g., Perplexity if applicable, though less reliable for comparing different decoding strategies) and human judgments.
    *   **Relevance/Task Success:** Task-specific metrics (e.g., ROUGE for summarization, Exact Match/F1 for QA) against reference outputs. Assess if interventions negatively impact task completion.
    *   **Diversity:** Measure n-gram diversity if relevant to assess impact on creativity/variability.
*   **Computational Cost:**
    *   **Latency:** Measure the average time taken to generate a sequence.
    *   **Throughput:** Measure sequences generated per second.
    *   **Memory Usage:** Track peak GPU/CPU memory consumption during inference.
*   **Uncertainty Calibration:**
    *   **Expected Calibration Error (ECE):** Assess if the uncertainty scores reflect the true likelihood of errors (Guo et al., 2017). Bin predictions by confidence and measure the difference between average confidence and accuracy within bins.
    *   **Correlation Analysis:** Correlate uncertainty scores with factual errors identified via human evaluation or automatic metrics.
