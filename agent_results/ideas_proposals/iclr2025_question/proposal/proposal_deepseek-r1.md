**Research Proposal: Uncertainty-Aware Decoding: A Proactive Framework for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models**  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  
**Background**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized NLP tasks, yet their tendency to "hallucinate"—generate plausible but factually incorrect content—poses severe risks in applications like healthcare and legal analysis. Existing solutions often employ post-hoc fact-checking or fine-tuning, but these methods are computationally expensive and fail to address hallucinations *during* generation. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a critical tool for identifying unreliable predictions in LLMs. However, integrating UQ directly into the decoding process remains underexplored, offering a promising pathway to mitigate hallucinations in real time.  

**Research Objectives**  
This research aims to:  
1. Design an **Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD)** framework that detects and mitigates hallucinations during text generation by leveraging token-level uncertainty metrics.  
2. Quantify the trade-offs between hallucination reduction, generation quality, and computational efficiency.  
3. Establish robust benchmarks and evaluation protocols for uncertainty-aware generation.  

**Significance**  
By intervening *proactively* during decoding, UAD could significantly enhance the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains. This work bridges the gap between uncertainty estimation and real-time decision-making in generative AI, complementing rather than replacing existing safety mechanisms.

### 2. **Methodology**  

#### **Research Design**  
The methodology integrates uncertainty estimation into the autoregressive generation loop using three components:  

**2.1 Data Collection**  
- **Base Models**: Test on GPT-3, LLaMA-2, and open-source alternatives (e.g., Mistral) to ensure generalizability.  
- **Evaluation Datasets**:  
  - **Factual QA**: TruthfulQA, Natural Questions.  
  - **Summarization**: XSum, CNN/DM (annotated for factual consistency).  
  - **Dialogue**: Wizard of Wikipedia (hallucination-prone conversational tasks).  

**2.2 Uncertainty Estimation**  
At each decoding step $t$, compute uncertainty metrics for candidate token $y_t$:  
1. **Predictive Entropy**:  
   $$ H(y_t) = -\sum_{k=1}^V p(y_t = w_k | \mathbf{y}_{<t}) \log p(y_t = w_k | \mathbf{y}_{<t}), $$  
   where $V$ is the vocabulary size.  
2. **MC Dropout Variance**:  
   $$ \text{Var}(y_t) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (p_i(y_t) - \bar{p}(y_t))^2, $$  
   where $N$ forward passes are performed with dropout enabled.  
3. **Ensemble Disagreement**:  
   Use lightweight submodels (e.g., adapters) to generate $K$ predictions and compute token-level variance.  

**2.3 Dynamic Intervention Thresholds**  
Threshold $\tau_t$ adapts based on historical uncertainty:  
$$ \tau_t = \alpha \tau_{t-1} + (1-\alpha) \cdot \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T H(y_{t-i}), $$  
where $\alpha$ controls the smoothing factor, and $T$ is the context window length.  

**2.4 Mitigation Strategies**  
If $H(y_t) \geq \tau_t$, trigger one of three interventions:  
1. **Evidence-Constrained Sampling**:  
   Query a retrieval system (e.g., DPR) for documents relevant to the context $\mathbf{y}_{<t}$, then restrict sampling to tokens appearing in retrieved evidence.  
2. **Uncertainty-Based Re-ranking**:  
   For $n$ candidate tokens, compute weighted scores:  
   $$ s(y_t) = \lambda \cdot p(y_t | \mathbf{y}_{<t}) + (1-\lambda) \cdot (1 - H(y_t)), $$  
   where $\lambda$ balances likelihood and uncertainty.  
3. **Unreliability Tagging**:  
   Insert a special token (e.g., `[UNRELIABLE]`) and trigger fallback mechanisms (e.g., prompt shortening or human-in-the-loop verification).  

**2.5 Experimental Design**  
- **Baselines**: Compare against greedy/beam search, nucleus sampling, and post-hoc methods (e.g., Post-Hoc Fact Checker).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Hallucination Rate**: Use FEVER, BARTScore, and human annotations.  
  - **Generation Quality**: Perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE-L.  
  - **Computational Overhead**: Latency (tokens/sec), memory usage.  
- **Ablation Studies**: Test individual components (e.g., effect of retrieval vs. re-ranking).

### 3. **Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

**Expected Outcomes**  
1. A 20–40% reduction in hallucination rates across benchmarks compared to standard decoding, with minimal degradation in generation quality.  
2. Empirical validation of lightweight ensembles as a compute-efficient alternative to MC dropout.  
3. Open-source implementation of UAD, including preconfigured thresholds for common tasks.  

**Impact**  
- **Technical**: Advances real-time uncertainty-aware decoding, providing a blueprint for safe LLM deployment.  
- **Societal**: Reduces risks of misinformation in medical, legal, and educational applications.  
- **Research**: Establishes benchmarks and evaluation protocols for future work on hallucination mitigation.  

**Challenges & Mitigations**  
- **Computational Overhead**: Optimize ensemble size and retrieval speed through distillation and caching.  
- **Threshold Calibration**: Use reinforcement learning to adapt $\tau_t$ dynamically across domains.  
- **Evaluation Subjectivity**: Partner with domain experts for task-specific hallucination annotation.

### 4. **Conclusion**  
This proposal tackles the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation by integrating uncertainty quantification directly into LLM decoding. By dynamically adjusting generation based on token-level confidence signals, UAD offers a scalable path toward trustworthy AI systems. Successful implementation will enable safer deployment of LLMs while preserving their generative versatility.
