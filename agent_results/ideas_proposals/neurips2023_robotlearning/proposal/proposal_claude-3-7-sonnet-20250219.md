# Safe Adapter-Based Fine-Tuning for Vision-Language Models in Robotics with Safety-Constrained Exploration

## 1. Introduction

The robotics field stands at a pivotal juncture with the rise of large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) that offer unprecedented semantic understanding capabilities. These models, trained on extensive internet-scale datasets, demonstrate remarkable abilities in comprehending visual scenes, understanding natural language instructions, and reasoning about object affordances and physical interactions. Such capabilities are particularly valuable for high-level robotic planning and decision-making tasks that require rich semantic understanding of the environment and the ability to generalize across contexts.

However, deploying these powerful large models in real-world robotic systems presents several significant challenges. First, the computational resources required for full fine-tuning of these models—which often contain billions of parameters—exceed the capabilities of most robotics laboratories and deployment scenarios. Second, robots operate in physical environments where unsafe actions can lead to damage to the robot, surrounding objects, or even pose risks to humans, making safe exploration during learning crucial. Third, the gap between the internet-scale data these models are pre-trained on and the specific embodied contexts robots operate in necessitates targeted adaptation strategies.

Recent work has explored partial fine-tuning approaches like adapters—small, trainable modules inserted between layers of a frozen pre-trained model—to address the computational challenge. Concurrently, the safe reinforcement learning literature has developed methods to constrain exploration within safe boundaries. However, these research directions have largely progressed independently, leaving a critical gap in methodologies that both efficiently adapt large VLMs to robotic tasks and ensure safety during the adaptation process.

This research aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel framework called Safety-Guided Adapters for Robotic Intelligence (SAFARI). SAFARI combines parameter-efficient adapter-based fine-tuning of VLMs with safety-constrained reinforcement learning to enable rapid, compute-efficient, and safe adaptation of large models to specific robotic tasks. Our approach introduces specialized "safety adapters" that are fine-tuned with a constraint-based reinforcement learning objective, enabling the system to learn task-specific behaviors while maintaining strict safety guarantees.

The significance of this research is threefold. First, it democratizes the use of large VLMs in robotics by dramatically reducing the computational resources required for adaptation. Second, it addresses the critical safety concerns that have limited the real-world deployment of learning-based robotic systems. Third, it provides a unified framework for multimodal reasoning that leverages the semantic understanding of pre-trained models while adapting them to embodied contexts.

## 2. Methodology

Our SAFARI framework consists of three main components: (1) the architecture design with safety-guided adapters, (2) the pre-training procedure to align these adapters with robotic state-action pairs, and (3) the fine-tuning procedure with safety-constrained reinforcement learning. We detail each component below.

### 2.1 Architecture: Safety-Guided Adapters

We build upon a large pre-trained vision-language model (such as CLIP, Flamingo, or similar) as our frozen backbone. The key innovation in our architecture is the introduction of two types of specialized adapter modules:

1. **Task Adapters (TA)**: Small feed-forward neural networks inserted after attention layers in the VLM to enable task-specific adaptation.

2. **Safety Adapters (SA)**: Specialized modules that learn to identify and avoid unsafe actions by modeling constraint violations.

For a pre-trained VLM with $L$ layers, we denote the hidden state at layer $l$ as $h^l$. The standard adapter transformation is given by:

$$A(h^l) = h^l + f_{\text{down}}(g(f_{\text{up}}(h^l)))$$

where $f_{\text{down}}$ and $f_{\text{up}}$ are linear projections that down-project to a bottleneck dimension $d << h^l$ and up-project back to the original dimension, respectively, and $g$ is a non-linear activation function.

Our safety adapters extend this formulation with a safety-oriented transformation:

$$SA(h^l) = h^l + f_{\text{down}}(g(f_{\text{up}}(h^l))) \odot \sigma(f_{\text{safety}}(h^l))$$

where $f_{\text{safety}}$ is a learnable projection that outputs a scalar safety score, $\sigma$ is the sigmoid activation function, and $\odot$ represents element-wise multiplication. This formulation allows the safety adapter to attenuate feature activations that might lead to unsafe actions.

The overall model architecture processes inputs as follows:

1. Vision and language inputs are encoded through the frozen backbone VLM.
2. Task and safety adapters modulate the hidden representations at strategic layers.
3. The final output is decoded to produce:
   - An action distribution $\pi(a|s)$ for task execution
   - A constraint violation predictor $C(s,a)$ that estimates the probability of safety constraint violations

The total number of trainable parameters in our adapter modules is typically less than 5% of the parameters in the frozen backbone, making this approach highly parameter-efficient.

### 2.2 Pre-Training: Multimodal Alignment

We pre-train our adapters on a diverse dataset of robot experiences $\mathcal{D} = \{(o_i, a_i, r_i, c_i)\}_{i=1}^N$, where $o_i$ represents multimodal observations (RGB images, depth, proprioception), $a_i$ represents robot actions, $r_i$ represents task rewards, and $c_i$ indicates constraint violations (1 if unsafe, 0 if safe).

The pre-training objective combines three components:

1. **Contrastive State-Action Alignment**: We align the adapted visual-language embeddings with robot state-action pairs using a contrastive learning objective:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{align}} = -\mathbb{E}_{(o,a) \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \log \frac{\exp(f_{\theta}(o, a) / \tau)}{\sum_{a' \in \mathcal{A}} \exp(f_{\theta}(o, a') / \tau)} \right]$$

where $f_{\theta}$ represents the similarity score between observation $o$ and action $a$ computed using our adapter-augmented model, and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.

2. **Safety Prediction**: We train the safety adapters to predict constraint violations:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{safety}} = \mathbb{E}_{(o,a,c) \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ -c \log C(o, a) - (1-c) \log (1 - C(o, a)) \right]$$

3. **Behavioral Cloning**: We use supervised learning on successful trajectories to initialize the policy:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{BC}} = \mathbb{E}_{(o,a) \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{success}}} \left[ -\log \pi(a|o) \right]$$

The overall pre-training loss is a weighted combination:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{pre-train}} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{align}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{safety}} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{BC}}$$

where $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, and $\lambda_3$ are hyperparameters controlling the relative importance of each component.

### 2.3 Fine-Tuning: Safety-Constrained Reinforcement Learning

After pre-training, we fine-tune the adapters using a safety-constrained reinforcement learning approach on target hardware. The key innovation is our Safety-Constrained Adapter Policy Optimization (SCAPO) algorithm, which extends the concept of constrained policy optimization to the adapter fine-tuning setting.

The objective of SCAPO is to find adapter parameters $\theta$ that maximize expected return while satisfying safety constraints:

$$\max_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_{\theta}} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t r_t \right]$$

$$\text{subject to } \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_{\theta}} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t c_t \right] \leq \delta$$

where $\tau$ represents trajectories, $\gamma$ is a discount factor, $r_t$ is the reward at time $t$, $c_t$ is a constraint cost (1 if constraint violated, 0 otherwise), and $\delta$ is a threshold on acceptable constraint violations.

Our SCAPO algorithm comprises several key components:

1. **Safety Shield**: We implement a safety critic $V_C(s)$ that estimates the expected cumulative constraint violations from a state. Actions are filtered through a safety shield that prevents actions with high estimated constraint violation:

$$a_{\text{filtered}} = \begin{cases}
a \sim \pi_{\theta}(·|s) & \text{if } C(s, a) < \tau_{\text{safe}} \\
a_{\text{safe}} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

where $a_{\text{safe}}$ is a backup safe action (e.g., stopping or returning to a safe pose).

2. **Conservative Q-Learning**: To ensure safety during the learning process, we use Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) which penalizes overestimation of Q-values for unseen state-action pairs:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{CQL}}(\theta) = \alpha \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \log \sum_{a} \exp(Q_{\theta}(s, a)) - \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \mathcal{D}(·|s)}[Q_{\theta}(s, a)] \right] + \mathcal{L}_{\text{TD}}(\theta)$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{TD}}(\theta)$ is the standard TD error, and $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter controlling the conservatism.

3. **Lagrangian Relaxation**: We convert the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one using Lagrangian relaxation:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{SCAPO}}(\theta, \lambda) = -\mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_{\theta}} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t r_t \right] + \lambda \left( \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_{\theta}} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t c_t \right] - \delta \right)$$

where $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier that is updated according to:

$$\lambda_{t+1} = \left[ \lambda_t + \eta_{\lambda} \left( \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_{\theta}} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t c_t \right] - \delta \right) \right]_+$$

4. **Trust Region Updates**: To ensure stable learning, we constrain policy updates to be within a trust region:

$$\mathbb{D}_{\text{KL}}(\pi_{\theta_{\text{new}}}(·|s) || \pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(·|s)) \leq \epsilon$$

The adapter parameters $\theta$ are updated using the gradients of the Lagrangian objective while respecting the trust region constraint.

### 2.4 Experimental Design

We will evaluate SAFARI on three robotics domains of increasing complexity:

1. **Tabletop Manipulation**: Object grasping and placement tasks with a 7-DOF robot arm, using RGB-D cameras as input.

2. **Mobile Manipulation**: Navigation and manipulation tasks with a mobile robot in cluttered environments.

3. **Human-Robot Interaction**: Collaborative tasks requiring safe interaction with humans and understanding of natural language instructions.

For each domain, we will compare SAFARI against the following baselines:

1. Full fine-tuning of the VLM (when computationally feasible)
2. Standard adapter fine-tuning without safety constraints
3. Safe reinforcement learning methods without vision-language model integration
4. Zero-shot VLM application without adaptation

The evaluation metrics will include:

1. **Task Success Rate**: Percentage of successfully completed tasks
2. **Safety Violations**: Number of constraint violations during learning and deployment
3. **Sample Efficiency**: Number of real-world interactions required to achieve a target performance
4. **Compute Efficiency**: GPU hours and memory requirements for training
5. **Generalization Performance**: Success rate on novel objects, environments, and instructions

We will also conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component:
- Comparing different adapter architectures
- Varying safety constraint thresholds
- Evaluating alternative safety critic designs
