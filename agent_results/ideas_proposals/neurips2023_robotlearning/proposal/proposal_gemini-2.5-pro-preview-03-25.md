**1. Title:** **Safe PALA: Parameter-Efficient and Safety-Aware Adaptation of Vision-Language Models for Robotic Control via Lightweight Adapters**

---

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
The integration of large pre-trained models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), marks a significant paradigm shift in robotics research. Models like PaLM-E (Driess et al., 2023), RT-2 (Brohan et al., 2023), and others have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in interpreting complex scenes, understanding natural language instructions, and generating high-level plans for robotic tasks. This progress stems from their pre-training on vast, diverse datasets encompassing text, images, and potentially videos or robot interactions, enabling them to acquire rich semantic priors about the world. These priors hold immense promise for enhancing robot autonomy, allowing robots to operate more flexibly in unstructured environments and respond intelligently to human commands.

However, deploying these colossal models directly onto robotic systems presents considerable challenges. Firstly, full fine-tuning of models with billions of parameters demands substantial computational resources (multiple high-end GPUs, extensive training time) and large amounts of task-specific robot data, which are often scarce or expensive to collect. This limits the accessibility and scalability of VLM deployment, particularly for labs or applications with constrained resources. Secondly, the direct application of policies derived from large pre-trained models in the physical world carries inherent safety risks. Pre-training data may lack the specific safety constraints relevant to a particular robot or environment, and fine-tuning procedures, especially those involving reinforcement learning (RL), can lead to unsafe exploration behaviours (e.g., collisions, excessive force application) that could damage the robot or its surroundings. While standard RL aims to maximize reward, ensuring safety (avoiding catastrophic failures) is often a prerequisite for real-world robotic deployment.

Recent advances in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2023), offer a promising direction to mitigate the computational burden. Adapters are small, task-specific modules inserted into a frozen pre-trained backbone, allowing adaptation by tuning only a minuscule fraction (<5%) of the total parameters. This drastically reduces compute and memory requirements. Concurrently, the field of Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) has developed various techniques to constrain agent behaviour during learning and execution, using methods like safety critics, constrained optimization (Liu et al., 2023; Kim & Oh, 2023), control barrier functions (Du et al., 2023), and shielding mechanisms (Kim et al., 2024).

Despite progress in these individual areas, a critical gap remains in integrating parameter-efficient adaptation with robust safety guarantees specifically for deploying large VLMs in robotics. Current adapter methods often focus solely on task performance and efficiency (Sharma et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024), while Safe RL methods typically assume full model access or do not explicitly leverage the power of pre-trained VLMs in a parameter-efficient manner.

**2.2 Research Objectives**
This research aims to bridge this gap by introducing **Safe PALA (Parameter-efficient and Safety-Aware Lighthouse Adapters)**, a novel framework for adapting large pre-trained VLMs to specific robotic tasks efficiently and safely. The core idea is to leverage lightweight "safety-aware" adapters that are first aligned with robot state-action semantics using offline data, and then fine-tuned on the target robot using a safety-constrained RL process, keeping the large VLM backbone frozen.

The specific objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop the Safety-Aware Adapter Architecture:** Design lightweight, modular adapter layers specifically suited for insertion into VLM architectures (e.g., within transformer blocks) to modulate the model's output for robotic control, while incorporating mechanisms amenable to safety signal integration.
2.  **Design a Two-Stage Training Protocol:**
    *   **Stage 1 (Offline Pre-training):** Develop a contrastive learning objective to pre-train only the adapter parameters using large-scale, offline multi-modal robotic datasets (e.g., RGB-D images, proprioceptive states, action sequences, language annotations). This stage aims to align the adapter outputs with meaningful robot state-action representations without requiring online interaction.
    *   **Stage 2 (Online Safe Fine-tuning):** Formulate a Safe RL algorithm (e.g., based on shielded policy updates or conservative Q-learning) that updates *only* the adapter parameters and a dedicated safety module (e.g., safety critic or shield) using limited interaction data from the target robot. This ensures task adaptation while strictly enforcing safety constraints.
3.  **Implement and Validate a Robust Safety Mechanism:** Integrate a learned safety critic or shield within the fine-tuning loop. This component will predict the safety of potential actions generated by the adapted VLM policy and intervene (e.g., veto or modify actions) to prevent constraint violations during exploration and deployment.
4.  **Evaluate Extensively:** Empirically validate the Safe PALA framework in both simulation and real-world robotic experiments (e.g., manipulation tasks guided by language instructions). The evaluation will focus on:
    *   **Parameter Efficiency:** Measure the percentage of trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.
    *   **Computational Efficiency:** Quantify fine-tuning time and data requirements.
    *   **Task Performance:** Assess success rates and learning speed compared to baselines.
    *   **Safety:** Measure the frequency and severity of safety constraint violations during fine-tuning and deployment.
    *   **Generalization:** Evaluate the adapted model's ability to handle variations in objects, environments, and instructions.

**2.3 Significance**
This research holds significant potential for advancing the practical application of large models in robotics. By enabling **safe, efficient, and effective** adaptation of powerful VLMs, Safe PALA addresses several key challenges highlighted in the workshop call and recent literature:

*   **Democratization:** It lowers the barrier for deploying state-of-the-art VLMs on robots with limited computational budgets and data availability, making these powerful tools accessible to a wider research community and industry applications.
*   **Safety Assurance:** It directly tackles the critical issue of safety in robot learning, providing a structured way to incorporate safety constraints during the adaptation of large pre-trained models, moving towards more reliable real-world deployment (addressing challenges raised by Liu et al., 2023; GÃ¼nster et al., 2024).
*   **Efficiency:** It offers a parameter- and sample-efficient fine-tuning solution, crucial for rapid adaptation to new tasks, embodiments, or environments, aligning with the goals of efficient adaptation mechanisms sought by the workshop.
*   **Bridging Modalities:** It leverages the strengths of VLMs in combining vision and language for semantic understanding while grounding them safely in physical action through specialized adapters and Safe RL.
*   **Modular Adaptation:** The proposed adapter-based approach maintains the integrity of the pre-trained VLM (Sharma et al., 2023) while allowing specialized adaptation, addressing the challenge of balancing adaptation and model integrity.

Ultimately, this work contributes to the development of trustworthy AI systems capable of interacting safely and effectively with the physical world, a crucial step towards realizing the full potential of large models in robotics.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Overall Framework**
The Safe PALA framework operates in two main stages: (1) Offline Pre-training of safety-aware adapters using large-scale diverse robotic data, and (2) Online Safe Fine-tuning on the specific target task and robot using limited interaction data and a Safe RL objective. The core VLM backbone remains frozen throughout both stages.

**3.2 Model Architecture**
We assume a standard VLM architecture, consisting of a vision encoder $f_{vis}$ (e.g., ViT), a language encoder $f_{lang}$ (e.g., T5, Llama), and a fusion mechanism (e.g., cross-attention) that produces a multi-modal representation $z = f_{VLM}(o_t, l_t)$, where $o_t$ is the visual observation (RGB-D image) and $l_t$ is the language instruction/goal at time $t$.

**Safety-Aware Adapters:** We will design lightweight adapter modules, denoted $f_{adapter}(\cdot; \theta_{adapter})$, parameterized by $\theta_{adapter}$. These adapters will be inserted into the VLM, potentially after specific layers (e.g., attention or feed-forward blocks) within the fusion mechanism or a subsequent policy head. A potential architecture involves small Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with bottleneck structures and non-linear activations. The key distinction of "safety-aware" adapters lies in their design being potentially influenced by or co-trained with safety-critical information during pre-training (depending on data availability) and being the sole target of safety-constrained updates during fine-tuning. The final output of the adapted model will be a robot action $a_t = \pi(z_t', p_t; \theta_{adapter})$, where $z_t' = f_{adapter}(z_t; \theta_{adapter})$ is the adapter-modified representation, and $p_t$ is the robot's proprioceptive state. The number of parameters in $\theta_{adapter}$ will be kept small, targeting <5% of the total VLM parameters.

**Safety Module:** A separate safety module, $S(s_t, a_t; \phi_{safe})$, parameterized by $\phi_{safe}$, will be implemented. This module takes the current state $s_t = (o_t, l_t, p_t)$ and a candidate action $a_t$ and predicts a safety score or classification (e.g., probability of constraint violation). This could be a Q-function $Q_{safe}$ estimating the expected safety cost (negative reward associated with violations) or a binary classifier $C_{safe}$ trained on violation data.

**3.3 Data Requirements**
*   **Offline Pre-training Data:** We will leverage large, diverse, multi-modal offline datasets like Open X-Embodiment (Open X-Embodiment Collaboration, 2023) or similar collections. These datasets contain sequences of (RGB-D image, proprioceptive state, action, language instruction/goal) triplets from various robots and tasks.
*   **Online Fine-tuning Data:** For each target task, we will collect a limited amount of interaction data ($< 1$ hour or a few thousand timesteps) directly on the target robot platform (simulated or real). This data will include observations, actions taken, task rewards, and safety constraint violation signals (e.g., collision detection, joint limit breaches, force/torque thresholds).

**3.4 Stage 1: Offline Adapter Pre-training**
*   **Goal:** Initialize the adapter parameters $\theta_{adapter}$ such that their outputs $z_t'$ are aligned with meaningful state-action representations relevant for control, leveraging the semantic understanding of the frozen VLM backbone $f_{VLM}$.
*   **Method:** We will employ a contrastive learning approach. Given a batch of transitions $(s_i, a_i, s_{i+1})$ from the offline dataset, where $s_i = (o_i, l_i, p_i)$, we compute the VLM representation $z_i = f_{VLM}(o_i, l_i)$ and pass it through the adapter $z'_i = f_{adapter}(z_i; \theta_{adapter})$. We also need an embedding for the action $a_i$, possibly obtained via a small learned projection head $g(a_i)$.
*   **Contrastive Objective:** We aim to make the adapter output $z'_i$ predictive of the corresponding action $a_i$. Using the InfoNCE loss, we maximize the similarity between $(z'_i, g(a_i))$ pairs while minimizing similarity with negative pairs $(z'_i, g(a_j))$ where $j \neq i$:
    $$
    \mathcal{L}_{contrastive}(\theta_{adapter}) = - \mathbb{E}_{(s_i, a_i) \sim \mathcal{D}_{offline}} \left[ \log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z'_i, g(a_i)) / \tau)}{\sum_{a_j \in \mathcal{A}_{batch}} \exp(\text{sim}(z'_i, g(a_j)) / \tau)} \right]
    $$
    Here, $\text{sim}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity), $\tau$ is a temperature hyperparameter, and $\mathcal{A}_{batch}$ includes the positive action $a_i$ and several negative actions $a_j$ from other transitions in the batch. Only $\theta_{adapter}$ and parameters of $g$ are updated. This step aligns the adapter with the action space conditioned on the VLM's rich state representation.

**3.5 Stage 2: Online Safe Fine-tuning**
*   **Goal:** Adapt the pre-trained adapters $\theta_{adapter}$ to the specific target task and robot dynamics using minimal online interaction, while ensuring safety constraints are met throughout the process.
*   **Method:** We will use a Safe RL algorithm. We formulate the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), maximizing the expected task reward $R_{task}$ subject to constraints on expected safety costs $C_{safety}$ (e.g., probability of collision per episode $\leq \delta$).
    $$
    \max_{\theta_{adapter}} \mathbb{E}_{\pi(\cdot | s; \theta_{adapter})} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t R_{task}(s_t, a_t) \right] \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \mathbb{E}_{\pi(\cdot | s; \theta_{adapter})} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t C_{safety}(s_t, a_t) \right] \leq C_{max
    }
    $$
*   **Safety Mechanism Integration:** We will primarily explore a **shielding** approach based on the safety module $S(s, a; \phi_{safe})$, referencing Kim et al. (2024).
    1.  Train the safety module $S$ concurrently with the policy. $S$ can be trained supervisedly if violation labels are available, or via estimating a safety value function (e.g., Q-function for safety cost).
    2.  At each timestep $t$, the policy $\pi(\cdot | s_t; \theta_{adapter})$ proposes an action $a_{prop}$.
    3.  The shield queries the safety module: $safe = S(s_t, a_{prop}; \phi_{safe})$.
    4.  If $S$ predicts $a_{prop}$ is safe (e.g., $C_{safe}(s_t, a_{prop}) < \epsilon$ or $Q_{safe}(s_t, a_{prop}) < Q_{thresh}$), execute $a_t = a_{prop}$.
    5.  If $S$ predicts $a_{prop}$ is unsafe, replace it with a minimally invasive safe fallback action $a_{safe}$. $a_{safe}$ could be a default safe action (e.g., stop), or computed by solving a small optimization problem to find the closest safe action to $a_{prop}$.
*   **Parameter Updates:** Crucially, the RL updates (e.g., policy gradient for the actor, TD-learning for the task critic) are applied *only* to the adapter parameters $\theta_{adapter}$ and potentially the task-specific critic parameters. The safety module parameters $\phi_{safe}$ are updated based on observed safety signals. The VLM backbone parameters $\theta_{VLM}$ remain frozen. Example policy update (simplified PPO style):
    $$
    \theta_{adapter} \leftarrow \theta_{adapter} + \eta \nabla_{\theta_{adapter}} \mathcal{L}_{RL}(\theta_{adapter})
    $$
    The safety shield ensures constraint satisfaction during execution, decoupling the primary task optimization from direct safety constraint handling within the RL objective, although using Lagrangian methods (as in Liu et al., 2023 or Kim & Oh, 2023) as an alternative or complement will also be considered.

**3.6 Experimental Design**
*   **Platforms:**
    *   Simulation: MuJoCo environments (e.g., Robosuite), Isaac Gym, or Habitat 2.0 for realistic physics and rendering.
    *   Real-world: Franka Emika Panda or Universal Robots UR5e arm.
*   **Tasks:** Language-conditioned manipulation tasks of increasing complexity:

    *   Simple tool use ("Use the sponge to wipe the table").
    *   Navigation and interaction ("Go to the kitchen counter and open the microwave").
*   **Baselines:**
    1.  **Full Fine-tuning (if feasible):** Fine-tune the entire VLM using standard RL (e.g., PPO/SAC) and Safe RL (e.g., Lagrangian PPO).
    2.  **Standard Adapters + RL:** Use adapters (Sharma et al., 2023) fine-tuned with standard RL (no safety constraints).
    3.  **Standard Adapters + Safe RL:** Use standard adapters fine-tuned with the same Safe RL method as Safe PALA. This isolates the benefit of the adapter pre-training stage.
    4.  **RL from Scratch:** Train a policy (potentially with the same architecture size as the adapters + policy head) using Safe RL without any VLM pre-training.
    5.  **Frozen VLM + RL Head:** Freeze the VLM and train only a randomly initialized policy head using Safe RL.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Performance:** Episodic Success Rate (%); Learning Curves (Success Rate vs. Environment Steps/Wall-clock Time); Sample Efficiency (Number of steps to reach target success rate).
    *   **Safety:** Number of Constraint Violations (e.g., collisions, joint limits, force limits) per episode during training and evaluation; Cumulative Safety Cost.
    *   **Efficiency:** Number of Trainable Parameters; Fine-tuning Time (hours on specified GPU); Inference Latency (ms).
    *   **Generalization:** Evaluate performance and safety on variations not seen during fine-tuning: novel objects (different shape/color), novel positions, slightly modified language instructions, minor environmental changes (lighting, distractors).
*   **Ablation Studies:**
    *   Effectiveness of adapter pre-training (compare Safe PALA with Baseline 3).
    *   Impact of the safety mechanism (compare Safe PALA with Baseline 2).
    *   Sensitivity to adapter architecture and size.
    *   Robustness to varying amounts of fine-tuning data.

**4.1 Expected Outcomes**
We anticipate the following outcomes from this research:

1.  **Demonstration of Parameter-Efficient Safe Adaptation:** We expect Safe PALA to successfully adapt large VLMs to complex, language-conditioned robotic tasks using significantly fewer trainable parameters (<5% of the VLM) compared to full fine-tuning.
2.  **Rapid Fine-tuning:** The fine-tuning process is expected to be substantially faster (<1 hour on a single standard GPU for typical manipulation tasks) and require significantly less task-specific data compared to training from scratch or full fine-tuning, achieving competitive task performance.
3.  **Robust Safety Guarantees:** We expect Safe PALA to demonstrate a significant reduction (potentially near-zero) in safety violations during both the fine-tuning phase and deployment on unseen test scenarios, compared to baselines without explicit safety mechanisms or those applying safety constraints to the full model inefficiently. The safety shield should effectively prevent catastrophic failures.
4.  **Effective Task Performance:** Despite the parameter efficiency and safety constraints, we anticipate that Safe PALA will achieve high task success rates, potentially comparable to or even exceeding standard adapter fine-tuning (due to safer exploration) and approaching the performance of full fine-tuning in data-limited regimes.
5.  **Validation of Modularity:** The results should validate the hypothesis that semantic understanding (from the frozen VLM) can be effectively decoupled from low-level, safety-critical control adaptation (handled by the adapters and safety module), showcasing a modular approach to building complex robotic systems.
6.  **Generalization Capabilities:** We expect the combination of the powerful VLM prior and targeted adapter tuning to yield policies that generalize reasonably well to moderate variations in objects, instructions, and environments, while maintaining safety.
