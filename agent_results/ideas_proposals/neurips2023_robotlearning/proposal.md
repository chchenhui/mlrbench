**"Safety-Critical Adapters: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Vision–Language Models for High-Stakes Robotic Deployment"**

### **2. Introduction**  

#### **Background**  
Large vision–language models (VLMs) like CLIP and Flamingo have revolutionized semantic scene understanding and high-level planning in robotics. However, deploying these models on physical robots requires adaptation to specific tasks and safety-critical constraints, which is computationally expensive and risks destabilizing pre-trained knowledge. Traditional fine-tuning of all parameters is infeasible for resource-limited robotic systems, and unsafe exploration during reinforcement learning (RL) can lead to catastrophic failures. Recent advances in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as adapters, offer a path to modular adaptation. However, existing methods do not explicitly integrate safety guarantees or robustly address dynamic environments.  

#### **Research Objectives**  
This research proposes a framework for **safety-critical adapter-based fine-tuning** of VLMs in robotics. Key objectives include:  
1. Develop lightweight "safety adapters"—parameter-efficient modules inserted into a frozen VLM backbone—for task-specific robot control.  
2. Pre-train adapters via contrastive alignment between vision–language embeddings and robot state-action pairs using offline multi-modal data.  
3. Fine-tune adapters with a safety-constrained RL algorithm that enforces risk-aware exploration and guarantees safe policy updates.  
4. Validate the framework on robotic manipulation and navigation tasks, demonstrating rapid adaptation (<1 hour on a single GPU) and zero-shot generalization.  

#### **Significance**  
By decoupling semantic reasoning (via frozen VLMs) from safe control adaptation (via adapters), this work addresses three critical challenges in robot learning:  
- **Efficiency**: Adapters reduce fine-tuning parameters by 95%, lowering compute and data requirements.  
- **Safety**: A shielding mechanism ensures exploration remains within pre-defined risk thresholds.  
- **Generalization**: Contrastive pre-training aligns multi-modal embeddings to generalize across tasks.  
This framework democratizes access to large models for real-world robots, enabling safe, sample-efficient deployment in homes, hospitals, and industrial settings.

### **3. Methodology**  

#### **Research Design**  
The framework consists of two phases: *pre-training adapters on offline data* and *safety-constrained RL fine-tuning*.  

---

##### **Phase 1: Contrastive Pre-Training of Safety Adapters**  

**Data Collection**  
- **Source**: Multi-modal logs from prior robotic deployments or human demonstrations, containing RGB-D frames, natural language task descriptions, and state-action trajectories $\{(I_t, D_t, s_t, a_t)\}_{t=1}^T$.  
- **Preprocessing**: Extract vision–language embeddings $(v_t, l_t)$ from a frozen VLM backbone (e.g., CLIP) for each frame $I_t$ and language command $D_t$.  

**Adapter Architecture**  
- Insert trainable adapter layers $\mathcal{A}$ after transformer blocks in the frozen VLM (Fig. 1). For a layer output $h$, the adapted feature is:  
  $$h' = h + \mathcal{A}(h)$$  
  where $\mathcal{A}$ is a two-layer MLP with bottleneck dimension $d \ll \text{dim}(h)$.  

**Contrastive Alignment Objective**  
Align vision–language embeddings $(v_t, l_t)$ with robot state-action pairs $(s_t, a_t)$:  
- Project $(s_t, a_t)$ to a shared latent space via MLP $g_\theta$: $z_t = g_\theta([s_t; a_t])$.  
- Maximize mutual information between $(v_t, l_t)$ and $z_t$ using a noise-contrastive loss:  
  $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{align}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(v_t, z_t)/\tau)}{\sum_{j=1}^N \exp(\text{sim}(v_t, z_j)/\tau)}$$  
  where $\text{sim}(\cdot)$ is cosine similarity, $\tau$ is temperature, and $N$ is the batch size.  

---

##### **Phase 2: Safety-Constrained RL Fine-Tuning**  

**RL Formulation**  
- **State**: Adapter-augmented VLM embeddings $h'$.  
- **Action**: Robot control $a_t$.  
- **Reward**: Task reward $r_t + \lambda \cdot r_{\text{safe}}$, where $r_{\text{safe}}$ penalizes unsafe states.  

**Shielded Policy Optimization**  
- **Policy Network**: $\pi_\phi(a_t | h')$ (adapters + MLP head), with parameters $\phi$ updated via proximal policy optimization (PPO).  
- **Safety Critic**: A risk-aware Q-network $Q_\psi(h', a_t)$ trained to estimate the cumulative risk of action $a_t$:  
  $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{critic}} = \mathbb{E}[(Q_\psi(h', a_t) - (\hat{\mathcal{R}} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_\psi'(h'_{t+1}, a')))^2]$$  
  where $\hat{\mathcal{R}}$ is the observed risk (e.g., proximity to obstacles).  
- **Shielded Update**: Before executing $a_t$, the safety critic vetoes actions exceeding a risk threshold $\epsilon$:  
  $$a_t' = \begin{cases} 
  a_t & \text{if } Q_\psi(h', a_t) < \epsilon \\
  a_{\text{safe}} & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}$$  
  where $a_{\text{safe}}$ is a backup policy or null action.  

**Algorithm**  
1. Initialize adapters $\mathcal{A}$ with contrastive pre-training.  
2. For each RL iteration:  
   - Collect rollouts using $\pi_\phi$ and shielded actions $a_t'$.  
   - Update $\pi_\phi$ via PPO, clipping gradients to stay near the safe policy.  
   - Update $Q_\psi$ using conservative Q-learning (CQL) to prevent overestimation:  
     $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{CQL}} = \alpha \cdot \mathbb{E}[\log \sum_a \exp(Q_\psi(h', a))] + \mathcal{L}_{\text{critic}}$$

##### **Experimental Design**  

**Tasks**  
- **Manipulation**: Object stacking with novel geometries (simulated via RLBench).  
- **Navigation**: Avoid dynamic obstacles in Habitat-Matterport environments.  

**Baselines**  
1. Full fine-tuning of VLM.  
2. Existing adapter methods (e.g., KALIE, Skip Tuning).  
3. Safe RL without adapters (e.g., TRC, Control Barrier Functions).  

**Metrics**  
- **Safety**: Number of collisions/unsafe actions per episode.  
- **Performance**: Task success rate, reward.  
- **Efficiency**: Training time, GPU memory usage, % of tuned parameters.  

**Statistical Validation**  
- Compare mean task success and safety metrics across 10 seeds using ANOVA.

### **4. Expected Outcomes & Impact**  

#### **Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Efficient Adaptation**: Adapters fine-tuned in <1 hour on a single GPU, with <5% of VLM parameters updated.  
2. **Provable Safety**: At least 95% reduction in unsafe actions compared to unshielded baselines.  
3. **Generalization**: >80% success rate on zero-shot tasks using pre-trained alignment.  

#### **Broader Impact**  
- **Democratization**: Enables small labs/researchers to deploy VLMs on low-cost robots.  
- **Safety Standards**: Establishes a framework for certifiable safe RL in physical systems.  
- **Cross-Domain Applications**: Adaptable to medical robots, autonomous vehicles, and human-robot collaboration.  

This work bridges the gap between large-scale VLMs and safe, efficient robotics, paving the way for trustworthy human-centric AI systems.
