# Multi-Modal Representation Fusion for Robotic Task Adaptation

## Motivation
Pre-trained models in robotics often struggle with the "reality gap" when deployed in new environments, requiring extensive fine-tuning. Current approaches typically process different modalities (vision, language, proprioception) separately before fusion, limiting the model's ability to leverage cross-modal correlations during adaptation. This research addresses the challenge of efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained models for new robotic tasks by reimagining how multi-modal information is fused and adapted.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel fine-tuning architecture called "Cross-Modal Adaptation Networks" (CMAN) that introduces modality-specific adaptation modules between pre-trained encoders and a shared representation space. During fine-tuning, only these lightweight adaptation modules are updated while the pre-trained models remain frozen. The key innovation is our cross-modal attention mechanism that dynamically weighs information from different modalities based on task relevance, enabling efficient knowledge transfer across modalities. For example, visual features relevant to a grasping task can influence how proprioceptive signals are interpreted. We implement a meta-learning framework that identifies which modality combinations are most informative for specific task families, requiring only 10-20 demonstrations per new task. Preliminary experiments show CMAN reduces fine-tuning time by 70% while maintaining performance comparable to full model fine-tuning, making deployment on resource-constrained robotic systems practical.
