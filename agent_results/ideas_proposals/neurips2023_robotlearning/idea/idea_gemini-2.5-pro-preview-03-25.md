**Title:** Constrained Parameter-Efficient Finetuning for Safe Robot Adaptation

**Motivation:** Large pre-trained models offer broad capabilities but require fine-tuning for specific robotic tasks and environments. Standard fine-tuning is computationally expensive, data-hungry, and provides no inherent safety guarantees, posing significant barriers to reliable real-world deployment, especially with limited resources.

**Main Idea:** We propose Constrained Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (C-PEFT), a method that integrates safety constraints directly into parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., LoRA, Adapters). During adaptation on limited target domain data, only a small subset of parameters is modified. Critically, the optimization objective for these parameters incorporates safety constraints (e.g., collision avoidance margins, joint limits, torque limits) derived from the robot's specifications or environment model. This could be achieved via constrained optimization or by adding safety-related penalty terms to the fine-tuning loss. The expected outcome is a methodology enabling rapid, low-resource adaptation of large models to specific robots/tasks while actively preventing unsafe actions, thus facilitating safer and more practical deployment.
