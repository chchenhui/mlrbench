### Title: Dynamic Human-AI Interaction Models for Adaptive Alignment

### Motivation
The rapid evolution of AI systems necessitates a more dynamic and interactive approach to alignment. Traditional unidirectional methods are insufficient to capture the complex, evolving nature of human-AI interactions. By focusing on bidirectional human-AI alignment, we aim to enhance AI's adaptability, ensuring that it aligns with human values and behaviors while preserving human agency.

### Main Idea
This research will develop a novel framework for dynamic human-AI interaction models that facilitate adaptive alignment. The framework will incorporate two main components:

1. **AI-Centered Perspective**: This component will focus on integrating human specifications into AI systems through continuous feedback loops. We will explore reinforcement learning with human feedback to enable AI systems to adapt to changing human preferences and values. Additionally, we will investigate methods for customizing and monitoring AI systems to ensure they remain aligned with human goals.

2. **Human-Centered Perspective**: This component will empower humans to critically evaluate, explain, and collaborate with AI systems. We will develop user-centered design principles and interaction mechanisms that enhance human-AI collaboration. This will include creating intuitive interfaces that allow users to provide feedback and understand AI decisions, promoting transparency and trust.

The methodology will involve:

- **Surveys and Interviews**: Gathering insights from domain experts and end-users to understand their needs and preferences.
- **Prototyping and Testing**: Developing prototypes of the proposed models and conducting user studies to evaluate their effectiveness.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously refining the models based on user feedback and performance metrics.

Expected outcomes include:

- Improved AI adaptability and alignment with human values.
- Enhanced human-AI collaboration and trust.
- A comprehensive framework for dynamic human-AI interaction models.

Potential impact:

- This research will contribute to the development of more ethical and effective AI systems.
- It will foster interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in AI alignment.
- It will create a platform for exchange and innovation, promoting a more inclusive human-AI alignment ecosystem.
