# Skill Library Scaffolding for Reincarnating RL

## Motivation
Reincarnating RL struggles with the challenge of effectively transferring knowledge across different environments or iterations of an agent. Current approaches often face difficulties when the quality or relevance of prior computational work varies. This research addresses the critical need for a structured approach to reusing learned skills that can adapt to different levels of prior knowledge quality, enabling more accessible and efficient RL development for researchers with limited computational resources.

## Main Idea
I propose a hierarchical skill library framework that organizes previously learned policies as modular skills with associated metadata about their performance characteristics, domains of applicability, and compatibility metrics. The system implements a "scaffolding" mechanism that evaluates incoming prior knowledge and strategically deploys it at different levels of abstraction. High-quality skills are used directly, while lower-quality ones are either decomposed into usable sub-components or used as exploration guides rather than action generators. The framework includes an automatic skill quality assessor that determines how each skill should be incorporated into new learning tasks without requiring manual annotation. This approach would enable researchers to leverage even imperfect prior computation by extracting maximum value according to quality level, significantly accelerating training across design iterations while being robust to varying levels of suboptimality in the original computation.
