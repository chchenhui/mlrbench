\section*{Retroactive Policy Correction in Reincarnating Reinforcement Learning via Suboptimal Data Distillation}

\subsection*{Introduction}
\subsubsection*{Background}
Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in solving complex tasks, yet the dominant paradigm remains learning \textit{tabula rasa}—starting from scratch. While effective in controlled settings, this approach struggles with scalability and computational inefficiency, especially as agents evolve through iterative design cycles. The emerging paradigm of \textit{reincarnating RL} seeks to address this by reusing prior computational artifacts (e.g., policies, datasets, models) to accelerate training, democratize access to large-scale problems, and enable iterative agent refinement. However, a critical challenge persists: prior work is often \textit{suboptimal}, containing outdated strategies, biased data, or partial observability. Naively incorporating such artifacts risks propagating errors and limiting final performance. For reincarnating RL to reach its full potential, methods must retroactively correct these imperfections while preserving trustworthy prior knowledge.

\subsubsection*{Research Objectives}
1. **Develop a Framework for Suboptimal Prior Data Distillation**: Propose a method that identifies unreliable regions in prior data (e.g., policies or datasets) using uncertainty-aware action-value estimation.  
2. **Mitigate Error Propagation**: Design a policy training objective that downweights updates in high-uncertainty regions while preserving reliable prior knowledge.  
3. **Empirical Validation**: Demonstrate improved robustness and sample efficiency over baselines in environments with synthetic suboptimality (e.g., stale policies, partial observability).  
4. **Generalization Analysis**: Evaluate the framework’s adaptability across discrete (Atari) and continuous (MuJoCo) control tasks.  

\subsubsection*{Significance}
This work addresses a critical gap in reincarnating RL by enabling safe reuse of imperfect prior computation, which is ubiquitous in real-world settings. By quantifying uncertainty in prior artifacts, the framework reduces reliance on resource-intensive retraining, lowering entry barriers for researchers with limited compute. It also advances the theoretical understanding of error propagation mitigation in iterative RL, fostering practical applications in robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems where prior computational work is rarely pristine.

\subsection*{Methodology}
\subsubsection*{Data Collection and Preprocessing}
- **Prior Data Sources**: Offline datasets (e.g., replay buffers from legacy policies), pretrained policies (suboptimal or partially observable), and synthetic noisy trajectories.  
- **Suboptimality Injection**: Introduce controlled artifacts into prior data:  
  - \textit{Stale Policies}: Train initial policies with limited exploration (e.g., reduced $\epsilon$-greedy decay).  
  - \textit{Partial Observability}: Mask a subset of state dimensions in offline trajectories.  
  - \textit{Biased Action Distributions}: Skew action frequencies in historical data.  

\subsubsection*{Algorithm Design}
The framework operates in two stages: \textit{Uncertainty Estimation} and \textit{Policy Distillation}.

\textbf{Stage 1: Ensemble Q-Network Training}  
Train an ensemble of $N$ Q-networks $\{Q_{\theta_i}\}_{i=1}^N$ on prior data $\mathcal{D}_{\text{prior}}$ using Double DQN loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{DQN}}(\theta_i) = \mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s') \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{prior}}} \left[ \left( Q_{\theta_i}(s,a) - \left( r + \gamma Q_{\theta^-_i}(s', \arg\max_{a'} Q_{\theta_i}(s', a')) \right) \right)^2 \right]
$$  
Uncertainty $\sigma^2(s,a)$ is estimated as the variance across ensemble predictions:  
$$
\sigma^2(s,a) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( Q_{\theta_i}(s,a) - \bar{Q}(s,a) \right)^2, \quad \bar{Q}(s,a) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N Q_{\theta_i}(s,a)
$$

\textbf{Stage 2: Uncertainty-Aware Policy Distillation}  
Train policy $\pi_{\phi}$ via offline RL (e.g., CQL) with a modified loss:  
$$
\mathcal{L}(\phi) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{CQL}}(\phi) + \lambda \mathbb{E}_{(s,a) \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{prior}}} \left[ w(s,a) \cdot \text{KL}\left( \pi_{\phi}(a|s) \| \pi_{\text{prior}}(a|s) \right) \right]
$$  
where $w(s,a) = \exp(-\beta \cdot \sigma^2(s,a))$ downweights uncertain regions, $\lambda$ balances RL and distillation objectives, and $\beta$ adjusts uncertainty sensitivity.

\subsubsection*{Experimental Design}
- **Environments**: Atari (Pong, Breakout) and MuJoCo (HalfCheetah, Hopper) with suboptimality injections.  
- **Baselines**:  
  - Standard fine-tuning (behavioral cloning + online RL).  
  - Offline RL (CQL, BCQ) without uncertainty weighting.  
  - Ensemble Q-learning without distillation.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - Final Performance: Normalized task rewards compared to optimal policies.  
  - Sample Efficiency: Training iterations required to surpass prior policy performance.  
  - Robustness: Performance variance under differing prior suboptimality levels.  
- **Statistical Validation**: Mann-Whitney U-tests for significance across 10 seeds.

\subsection*{Expected Outcomes}
1. **Superior Robustness**: The framework will outperform baselines by $\geq 15\%$ in scenarios with severe suboptimality (e.g., 50\% masked states), as quantified by normalized reward metrics.  
2. **Efficient Error Mitigation**: Uncertainty-aware distillation will reduce error propagation by $\geq 30\%$, measured by the ratio of corrected vs. uncorrected actions in trajectories.  
3. **Broad Generalizability**: Performance gains will be consistent across discrete and continuous tasks, with $\leq 10\%$ degradation in worst-case suboptimality levels.  
4. **Computational Tractability**: Training time will remain within $1.2\times$ of standard offline RL, ensuring scalability.  

\subsection*{Impact}
This research will directly address the democratization goals of reincarnating RL by enabling practitioners to iteratively refine agents without prohibitive compute. By formalizing uncertainty-aware distillation, it will provide a theoretical foundation for safe prior reuse, reducing redundant computation in industrial RL pipelines. The released code and benchmarks will facilitate community-wide adoption, while the insights on error propagation will inform future work in transfer learning and lifelong RL. Ultimately, the framework’s ability to salvage value from imperfect prior work will accelerate RL deployment in real-world systems where data quality is inherently noisy.
