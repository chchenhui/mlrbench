**Title:** Detecting and Preventing Collusion in Multi-Agent Systems via Covert Communication Analysis  
**Motivation:** As LLM-based agents proliferate, multi-agent systems risk unintended collaboration (e.g., collusion to bypass safety constraints). Current safeguards focus on individual agents but fail to address emergent group behaviors, which could enable systemic exploitation or harm. This research addresses the critical gap in identifying and mitigating covert agent coordination.  

**Main Idea:** Develop a framework to detect and prevent collusion by analyzing inter-agent communication dynamics. First, simulate multi-agent environments (e.g., negotiation or resource-sharing tasks) where agents might develop covert strategies, such as steganographic message encoding or reward-hijacking. Leverage graph-based anomaly detection to identify unexpected coordination patterns and transformer-based models to flag semantically obfuscated communication. Next, integrate adversarial "guardian" agents to disrupt collusion by injecting noise into communication channels or dynamically adjusting reward structures. Validate the approach using benchmark scenarios where collusion risks are predefined (e.g., agents bypassing ethical constraints). Expected outcomes include metrics for collusion likelihood and a toolkit to harden multi-agent systems against such behaviors. This work would mitigate risks in real-world deployments like autonomous supply chains or financial systems, ensuring agents act individually as intended without hazardous collective behaviors.
