# Socially-Aligned Multimodal Learning from Implicit Human Feedback

## 1. Introduction

The increasing prevalence of interactive learning systems in real-world applications has highlighted significant limitations in current approaches that rely predominantly on explicit, scalar rewards or labeled feedback. These systems fail to capture the rich tapestry of implicit information that humans naturally provide during interactions, such as facial expressions, gestures, eye movements, tone of voice, and other multimodal cues. This oversight restricts the ability of learning agents to develop a comprehensive understanding of human intent, preferences, and social dynamics.

The challenge of interactive learning from humans is multifaceted. First, the data distribution is inherently influenced by the algorithm's own decisions, creating a closed-loop system where adaptive learning is crucial. Second, the environment and human preferences exhibit non-stationarity, changing rapidly over time and context. Third, human feedback in natural settings is rarely provided as explicit rewards but rather manifests in various implicit forms that are more intuitive for humans but challenging for machines to interpret.

Current approaches to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) have made progress in incorporating explicit human preferences but still struggle with the richness of implicit signals. For instance, Abramson et al. (2022) demonstrated improvements in multimodal interactive agents using RLHF, but relied primarily on explicit human judgments. Similarly, Lee et al. (2021) introduced PEBBLE, which enhances sample efficiency through preference queries but does not fully leverage the wealth of implicit feedback available during interactions.

Some promising work has begun exploring implicit feedback channels, such as Xu et al. (2020), who utilized EEG-based error-related potentials to accelerate reinforcement learning. However, these approaches typically focus on a single modality of implicit feedback rather than integrating the diverse array of signals humans naturally provide.

This research addresses a critical gap in interactive learning systems: the ability to learn intrinsic reward functions from multimodal implicit human feedback without requiring predefined semantics. We propose a framework that enables agents to interpret and learn from diverse implicit feedback signals during human-agent interaction, adaptively developing an understanding of human intent and preferences over time. Our approach combines multimodal representation learning, inverse reinforcement learning, and meta-learning to create agents that can align with human social cues and adapt to non-stationary preferences.

The significance of this research extends to numerous domains where human-AI collaboration is essential, including personalized education, healthcare assistance, and collaborative robotics. By enabling agents to learn from natural human feedback, we can develop more intuitive, adaptive, and socially aligned AI systems that reduce the burden on humans to provide explicit feedback and instead leverage the wealth of implicit information already present in human-machine interactions.

## 2. Methodology

Our methodology consists of four key components: (1) multimodal data collection, (2) implicit feedback representation learning, (3) intrinsic reward inference, and (4) meta-reinforcement learning for adaptation. We detail each component below.

### 2.1 Multimodal Data Collection

To develop and evaluate our approach, we will collect a comprehensive dataset of human-agent interactions across multiple modalities. The data collection will involve:

1. **Interactive Environment**: We will develop a simulated 3D environment similar to DeepMind's Interactive Agents (Abramson et al., 2021) where humans can interact with an agent through various tasks requiring collaboration and communication.

2. **Multimodal Sensors**: During interactions, we will record:
   - Visual data: facial expressions, eye gaze, and gestures
   - Audio data: speech content, prosody, tone, and vocal characteristics
   - Interaction data: task performance metrics, interaction patterns, and timing

3. **Participant Diversity**: We will recruit 50-100 participants across different demographics to ensure diversity in interaction styles and feedback patterns.

4. **Task Variety**: Tasks will span collaborative problem-solving, instructional scenarios, and open-ended interactions to capture a broad spectrum of implicit feedback contexts.

5. **Annotation Protocol**: A subset of the collected data will be annotated by human evaluators to provide ground truth labels of human intent/feedback for model training and evaluation. Annotations will include perceived valence (positive/negative), intensity, and categorization of feedback types.

### 2.2 Implicit Feedback Representation Learning

To extract meaningful representations from multimodal implicit feedback, we propose a contrastive learning framework that maps diverse feedback signals into a unified latent space that correlates with human intent.

#### 2.2.1 Multimodal Encoders

For each modality, we will employ specialized encoders:

1. **Visual Encoder**: A vision transformer (ViT) processes facial expressions and gestures, yielding embeddings $E_v(v_t)$ for visual input $v_t$ at time $t$.

2. **Audio Encoder**: A wav2vec 2.0-based model extracts acoustic features beyond speech content, producing embeddings $E_a(a_t)$ for audio input $a_t$.

3. **Interaction Encoder**: A temporal convolutional network captures patterns in user actions, generating embeddings $E_i(i_t)$ for interaction data $i_t$.

#### 2.2.2 Cross-Modal Fusion

We employ a cross-attention transformer architecture to fuse information across modalities. The fusion process is defined as:

$$F(v_t, a_t, i_t) = \text{MultiHeadAttn}(\text{Concat}[E_v(v_t), E_a(a_t), E_i(i_t)])$$

This produces a unified representation that captures complementary information across modalities while handling potential missing modalities through appropriate masking mechanisms.

#### 2.2.3 Contrastive Learning Objective

To train the representation without requiring explicit feedback labels, we employ a temporal contrastive learning objective. Given a sequence of interaction states $s_1, s_2, ..., s_T$ and corresponding multimodal observations $o_1, o_2, ..., o_T$, we define positive pairs as temporally adjacent observations within the same interaction episode and negative pairs as observations from different episodes.

The contrastive loss is defined as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(F(o_t), F(o_{t+1}))/\tau)}{\sum_{j \neq t} \exp(\text{sim}(F(o_t), F(o_j))/\tau)}$$

where $\text{sim}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the cosine similarity and $\tau$ is a temperature parameter.

Additionally, for the subset of annotated data, we incorporate a supervised contrastive loss:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{supervised}} = -\log \frac{\sum_{j:y_j=y_i} \exp(\text{sim}(F(o_i), F(o_j))/\tau)}{\sum_{k \neq i} \exp(\text{sim}(F(o_i), F(o_k))/\tau)}$$

where $y_i$ represents the feedback label for observation $o_i$.

The total representation learning objective is:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{repr}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{supervised}}$$

where $\lambda$ balances the unsupervised and supervised components.

### 2.3 Intrinsic Reward Inference

Once we have learned meaningful representations of implicit feedback, we use these representations to infer intrinsic rewards that can guide the agent's learning process.

#### 2.3.1 Reward Mapping Function

We define a reward mapping function $R_\phi(F(o_t), s_t, a_t)$ that maps the feedback representation, state, and action to a scalar reward. This function is implemented as a neural network with parameters $\phi$:

$$R_\phi(F(o_t), s_t, a_t) = \text{MLP}_\phi(\text{Concat}[F(o_t), E_s(s_t), E_a(a_t)])$$

where $E_s$ and $E_a$ are state and action encoders respectively.

#### 2.3.2 Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning

To infer the reward function without requiring explicit reward labels, we employ maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (MaxEnt IRL). The key idea is to find a reward function that explains the observed human feedback patterns, assuming that human feedback is approximately optimal with respect to their internal reward function.

The objective for MaxEnt IRL is:

$$\max_\phi \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\text{human}}}[\log \pi_\phi(a|s)] - \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\phi}[\log \pi_\phi(a|s)]$$

where $\pi_{\text{human}}$ represents the human's implicit policy (inferred from their feedback patterns) and $\pi_\phi$ is the policy induced by the reward function $R_\phi$.

In practice, we optimize this objective using adversarial training, where we iteratively update the reward function and the agent's policy:

1. Update reward function parameters $\phi$ to maximize the difference in expected rewards between trajectories that elicited positive implicit feedback and those that elicited negative feedback.
2. Update policy parameters to maximize expected rewards under the current reward function.

#### 2.3.3 Uncertainty-Aware Reward Model

To handle ambiguity and noise in implicit feedback, we incorporate uncertainty estimation in our reward model. Instead of predicting point estimates, our reward function outputs a distribution over rewards:

$$R_\phi(F(o_t), s_t, a_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_\phi(F(o_t), s_t, a_t), \sigma^2_\phi(F(o_t), s_t, a_t))$$

This allows the agent to modulate its learning based on the confidence of the reward inference, placing more weight on feedback signals with lower uncertainty.

### 2.4 Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Adaptation

To address the non-stationarity of human preferences and environmental dynamics, we employ a meta-learning approach that enables rapid adaptation to individual users and changing contexts.

#### 2.4.1 Task Formulation

We formulate each interaction session with a user as a separate task in the meta-learning framework. The meta-learning objective is to find a policy initialization that can quickly adapt to new users or changes in the same user's preferences.

#### 2.4.2 Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)

We adopt the MAML algorithm for meta-learning, which finds a policy initialization that can be rapidly fine-tuned with a few gradient steps on data from a new task. The meta-objective is:

$$\min_\theta \sum_{i} \mathcal{L}_i({\theta'_i}) = \sum_{i} \mathcal{L}_i({\theta - \alpha\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_i(\theta)})$$

where $\theta$ are the parameters of the policy, $\theta'_i$ are the adapted parameters for task $i$ after one or more gradient steps, and $\mathcal{L}_i$ is the reinforcement learning objective for task $i$ using the inferred rewards.

#### 2.4.3 Online Adaptation

During deployment, the agent continuously adapts its policy and reward model based on new implicit feedback:

1. Update the reward model $R_\phi$ using recent interactions and feedback.
2. Adapt the policy $\pi_\theta$ using the updated rewards through fast gradient updates.
3. Track uncertainty in the reward model to modulate the adaptation rate.

This online adaptation process enables the agent to align with changing user preferences while maintaining stable performance.

### 2.5 Experimental Design and Evaluation

#### 2.5.1 Comparative Methods

We will compare our approach against several baselines:

1. Standard RL with hand-crafted rewards
2. RLHF with explicit preference labels
3. Single-modality implicit feedback methods (e.g., EEG-based or facial expression-only)
4. Non-adaptive multimodal feedback methods

#### 2.5.2 Evaluation Metrics

We will evaluate our approach using:

1. **Task Performance**: Objective metrics specific to each task (e.g., completion time, success rate)
2. **Feedback Alignment**: Correlation between inferred rewards and human annotations
3. **Adaptation Speed**: How quickly the agent adapts to new users or changing preferences
4. **Human Satisfaction**: Subjective ratings from users on interaction quality
5. **Interaction Efficiency**: Reduction in explicit feedback needed from users

#### 2.5.3 Ablation Studies

We will conduct ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of:
1. Each modality to the overall performance
2. Contrastive learning vs. supervised learning
3. Uncertainty estimation in the reward model
4. Meta-learning vs. standard transfer learning

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact

2. **Education and Training**: Adaptive tutoring systems could leverage implicit feedback to personalize learning experiences, detecting confusion, engagement, or frustration through facial expressions and adjusting teaching strategies accordingly.

3. **Healthcare and Therapy**: Assistive robots could learn from therapists' implicit guidance to provide personalized care and adapt to patients' changing needs over time.

4. **Human-Robot Collaboration**: Industrial robots could become more intuitive collaborators by interpreting workers' implicit cues, enhancing safety and efficiency in mixed human-robot teams.

5. **Ethical AI Development**: By aligning AI systems with human social cues and preferences, our approach contributes to the development of AI that better respects human values and intentions, addressing aspects of the alignment problem.

In addressing the interaction-grounded learning paradigm with minimal assumptions, our research tackles one of the most challenging and valuable problems in interactive machine learning: how to create agents that can learn from the rich, natural feedback humans already provide, rather than requiring humans to adapt to the limitations of current AI systems.
