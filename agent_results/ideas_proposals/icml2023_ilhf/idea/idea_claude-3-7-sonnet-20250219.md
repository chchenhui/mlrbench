# Decoding Facial Expressions for Interactive Reinforcement Learning

## Motivation
Current interactive learning systems predominantly rely on explicit human feedback like scalar rewards or demonstrations, missing out on the rich implicit signals humans naturally provide. Facial expressions represent one of the most accessible and information-rich channels of human feedback, yet they remain underutilized in reinforcement learning frameworks. As interactive systems become more prevalent in everyday applications, developing algorithms that can interpret these natural human responses would create more intuitive human-machine interactions and significantly reduce the feedback burden on users.

## Main Idea
We propose a novel framework that integrates real-time facial expression recognition into reinforcement learning systems without requiring pre-labeled meaning for expressions. The system employs a three-stage approach: 1) An unsupervised representation learning phase that clusters facial expressions into distinct patterns; 2) A correlation mechanism that associates these patterns with environmental states and agent actions to infer reward signals; and 3) An adaptive interpretation component that continuously refines the meaning of expressions based on interaction context and consistency. By grounding the meaning of expressions through repeated interactions, the system gradually builds a personalized model of the user's feedback style. We'll evaluate this approach in both virtual assistant tasks and robotic learning scenarios, measuring how quickly the system adapts to individual users and how effectively it translates facial feedback into improved performance compared to traditional explicit feedback methods.
