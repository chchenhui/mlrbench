**1. Title**  
**Dynamical Insights into Edge of Stability Optimization for Large-Scale Deep Learning**

**2. Motivation**  
Modern deep learning optimizers often use large learning rates and gradient noise to train massive models, yet classical convergence theory fails to explain their success. The Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon—where training hovers near an unstable regime while minimizing loss—remains poorly understood, leading to inefficient trial-and-error practices for large models. Developing a theoretical framework to harness EoS dynamics could drastically reduce computational costs in the era of billion-parameter models.

**3. Main Idea**  
We propose a hybrid theoretical-empirical approach to characterize the EoS regime via continuous approximations of gradient dynamics (e.g., stochastic differential equations) that explicitly model gradient noise and curvature. By analyzing how oscillations and stability boundaries interact with non-convex landscapes, we aim to design an adaptive optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts learning rates and noise schedules to operate at EoS without diverging. The algorithm will incorporate curvature estimates from low-cost Hessian approximations to modulate updates, enabling stable convergence with accelerated training. Expected outcomes include improved convergence guarantees for modern architectures (e.g., vision/language models) and open-source implementations demonstrating 2–3x speedups in training large-scale models. This work bridges optimization theory with practical needs, offering actionable guidelines to reduce energy and time costs in foundation model training.
