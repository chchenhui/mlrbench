**1. Title: Dynamical Insights into Edge of Stability Optimization for Large-Scale Deep Learning**

**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Background**
Deep learning has become the cornerstone of modern artificial intelligence, achieving remarkable success across diverse domains, from natural language processing and computer vision to scientific discovery (LeCun et al., 2015). This progress has been fueled by the development of increasingly large and complex models, often referred to as foundation models, with parameter counts reaching billions or even trillions (Brown et al., 2020). However, training these massive models presents significant challenges. The computational cost and time required are immense, often demanding vast resources accessible only to a few large organizations. Furthermore, the optimization process underlying deep learning remains poorly understood from a theoretical standpoint. Classical optimization theory, largely developed for convex or smooth non-convex settings, often fails to capture the complex dynamics observed in practice, particularly when using techniques common in modern deep learning like large learning rates, stochastic gradients, and adaptive methods (Goodfellow et al., 2016). This disconnect between theory and practice hinders the principled design of efficient and reliable training procedures, forcing practitioners to rely heavily on heuristics and extensive, costly trial-and-error hyperparameter tuning. As model scale continues to grow, the need for a robust mathematical understanding of deep learning optimization becomes ever more critical to guide practice and democratize access to state-of-the-art AI.

**2.2 Motivation and Problem Statement**
A key phenomenon exemplifying the gap between theory and practice is the "Edge of Stability" (EoS) (Cohen et al., 2021). Empirical studies have revealed that standard optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum, when tuned for optimal performance, often operate in a regime where the learning rate $\eta$ pushes the dynamics to the brink of instability. Specifically, the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss function, $\lambda_{\max}(\nabla^2 L(x))$, often satisfies $\eta \lambda_{\max} \approx 2$, the theoretical stability limit for gradient descent with learning rate $\eta$ on a quadratic objective. In this regime, the training loss exhibits non-monotonic behavior over short timescales (oscillations or temporary increases) but achieves faster convergence and better generalization over longer timescales compared to training strictly within the stable regime ($\eta \lambda_{\max} < 2$).

Current theoretical frameworks struggle to fully explain why operating at the EoS is beneficial or how stability is maintained despite flirting with divergence. While some initial analyses suggest implicit regularization mechanisms (Arora et al., 2022), a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics, particularly considering the interplay of large learning rates, stochastic gradient noise, complex non-convex loss landscapes, and adaptive components, is lacking. This lack of understanding translates directly into practical difficulties: tuning optimizers to effectively exploit the EoS regime without causing divergence is challenging and often relies on ad-hoc strategies like learning rate warmup and decay schedules, demanding extensive experimentation. For billion-parameter models, this "guesswork" approach leads to prohibitive computational costs and energy consumption.

This research is motivated by the urgent need to develop a principled understanding of EoS dynamics and leverage this understanding to design more efficient optimization algorithms for large-scale deep learning. By characterizing the behavior of optimizers near this stability boundary, potentially using tools from dynamical systems and continuous-time approximations, we aim to develop methods that can actively target and operate within the EoS regime, unlocking faster convergence while maintaining stability.

**2.3 Research Objectives**
The primary goal of this research is to develop a deeper theoretical understanding of Edge of Stability dynamics and translate these insights into a practical, adaptive optimization algorithm that accelerates the training of large-scale deep learning models. Our specific objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Theoretical Framework for EoS Dynamics:** Characterize the behavior of SGD and its variants (e.g., SGD with momentum) near the EoS boundary ($\eta \lambda_{\max} \approx 2$) in the context of deep learning loss landscapes. Analyze the role of gradient noise, curvature interaction, and potential implicit regularization effects using a combination of discrete dynamics analysis and continuous approximations (e.g., Stochastic Differential Equations - SDEs).
2.  **Design an Adaptive EoS Optimization Algorithm:** Propose a novel optimization algorithm that explicitly estimates the proximity to the EoS boundary during training and dynamically adjusts its parameters (primarily the learning rate) to operate near this boundary for optimal acceleration without divergence.
3.  **Incorporate Efficient Curvature Estimation:** Integrate low-computation-cost methods for estimating the relevant curvature information (specifically, approximations of $\lambda_{\max}(\nabla^2 L)$) into the adaptive optimizer, ensuring the overhead is minimal compared to the potential gains in convergence speed.
4.  **Provide Theoretical Analysis:** Analyze the stability and convergence properties of the proposed adaptive algorithm, aiming to provide guarantees (potentially under simplifying assumptions) that explain its effectiveness in navigating the EoS regime.
5.  **Empirical Validation on Large-Scale Tasks:** Rigorously evaluate the proposed algorithm on challenging, large-scale deep learning benchmarks, including vision transformers and language models, demonstrating its effectiveness in terms of convergence speed (wall-clock time, iterations), final model performance, and stability compared to standard optimizers like AdamW and SGD with momentum.

**2.4 Significance and Contribution**
This research addresses fundamental questions at the intersection of optimization theory and deep learning practice, directly aligning with the goals of the "Mathematics of Modern Machine Learning" community. Its potential contributions are significant:

*   **Theoretical Advancement:** It promises to deepen our understanding of the complex optimization dynamics prevalent in modern deep learning, particularly the EoS phenomenon, potentially reconciling observations from practice with theoretical models. The use and adaptation of continuous-time methods (SDEs) for analysing EoS dynamics would provide new analytical tools.
*   **Algorithmic Innovation:** The proposed adaptive EoS optimizer represents a novel approach to algorithm design, moving beyond fixed schedules or heuristics towards dynamic control based on the local geometry of the loss landscape and stability considerations.
*   **Practical Impact:** If successful, the algorithm could lead to substantial reductions (targeting 2-3x speedups as per the initial idea) in the time and computational resources required to train large-scale models. This would not only benefit large research labs but also make state-of-the-art AI more accessible to the broader academic community and industry, fostering innovation. It also contributes to "Green AI" by potentially reducing the energy footprint of training massive models.
*   **Bridging Theory and Practice:** This work directly tackles the challenge of creating theory that informs practice, providing both fundamental insights and a readily usable algorithm with open-source implementation, offering actionable guidelines for practitioners.

**3. Methodology**

Our research methodology combines theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and empirical validation in a synergistic loop.

**3.1 Phase 1: Theoretical Characterization of EoS Dynamics**

*   **Discrete Dynamics Analysis:** We will begin by analyzing the discrete update rule of SGD and SGD with momentum near the EoS boundary. For SGD, the update is $x_{k+1} = x_k - \eta \nabla L(x_k)$. Local stability depends on the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of this map, $I - \eta \nabla^2 L(x)$. Instability occurs when an eigenvalue has magnitude > 1, which for the eigenvalue corresponding to $\lambda_{\max}$ happens when $|1 - \eta \lambda_{\max}| > 1$, implying $\eta \lambda_{\max} > 2$ (assuming $\eta, \lambda_{\max} > 0$). We will analyze the behavior exactly at or slightly beyond this threshold, considering the non-linear effects and the impact of gradient noise $\hat{g}_k = \nabla L(x_k) + \xi_k$. We will investigate how oscillations emerge and whether they play a role in exploring the landscape or escaping sharp minima, potentially linking to the implicit bias observed by Arora et al. (2022).
*   **Continuous Approximations (SDEs):** To capture the average behavior and the role of stochasticity, we will explore SDE approximations. While standard SDE limits of SGD, like $$dX_t = -\nabla L(X_t) dt + \sqrt{2\eta/\beta} dW_t$$ (where $\beta$ is batch size and temperature $T=1$), might not fully capture the oscillatory EoS dynamics directly (as noted by Cohen et al., 2021), they can provide insights into the influence of noise structure and landscape geometry on the long-term trajectory. We may need to consider modified SDEs or analyze the SDE framework's limitations in this high-learning-rate regime. We will build upon existing work on continuous-time SGD (Wang & Sirignano, 2022; Lugosi & Nualart, 2024) but focus specifically on the EoS context, potentially analyzing second-moment dynamics or stability conditions of related stochastic processes. The goal is to understand average stability properties and the interplay between drift ($-\nabla L$) and diffusion ($\sqrt{2\eta T} dW_t$) modulated by the large $\eta$ and local curvature.

**3.2 Phase 2: Design of the Adaptive EoS Optimizer (AdaEoS)**

Based on the theoretical insights, we propose an adaptive optimization algorithm, tentatively named "AdaEoS".

*   **Core Mechanism:** AdaEoS will dynamically adjust the learning rate $\eta_k$ at each step $k$ (or periodically) to maintain the stability indicator $\sigma_k = \eta_k \hat{\lambda}_{\max, k}$ close to the target EoS value, typically $\sigma_{target} = 2$. Here, $\hat{\lambda}_{\max, k}$ is an estimate of the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian $\nabla^2 L(x_k)$.
*   **Efficient Curvature Estimation:** Estimating $\lambda_{\max}$ accurately and efficiently is crucial. We will employ low-cost iterative methods based on Hessian-vector products ($Hv$). The vector $v$ can be chosen stochastically or as the current gradient/momentum direction. The power iteration method, applied to the Hessian (approximated using mini-batches), can estimate the dominant eigenvalue.
    *   *Hessian-Vector Product:* Computed efficiently using finite differences or automatic differentiation (Pearlmutter, 1994): $H v \approx [\nabla L(x + \epsilon v) - \nabla L(x - \epsilon v)] / (2\epsilon)$. This requires two extra gradient computations per iteration of the power method.
    *   *Power Iteration:* Initialize a random vector $v_0$. Iterate $v_{j+1} = H v_j / \| H v_j \|$ for a small number of steps $J$. Then $\hat{\lambda}_{\max} \approx v_J^T H v_J$. We will investigate using very few iterations ($J=1$ or $J=2$) and potentially use stochastic mini-batches for computing $H$ to minimize overhead.
*   **Learning Rate Adaptation Rule:** The learning rate $\eta_{k+1}$ will be updated based on the current estimate $\hat{\lambda}_{\max, k}$ and the current learning rate $\eta_k$. A potential rule is:
    $$\eta_{k+1} = \eta_k \times \left( \frac{\sigma_{target}}{\eta_k \hat{\lambda}_{\max, k}} \right)^\gamma$$
    where $\sigma_{target} \approx 2$ is the target stability level, and $\gamma \in (0, 1]$ is a damping factor (e.g., $\gamma=0.1$) to prevent overly aggressive changes. We might also incorporate clipping or smoothing for $\hat{\lambda}_{\max, k}$ and the resulting $\eta_{k+1}$.
*   **Integration with Momentum:** The adaptation rule will be integrated into standard optimizers like SGD with momentum:
    1.  Compute gradient estimate $g_k$.
    2.  Update momentum buffer: $m_{k+1} = \beta m_k + (1-\beta) g_k$.
    3.  Estimate $\hat{\lambda}_{\max, k}$ (periodically, e.g., every $N$ steps, or adaptively based on loss behavior).
    4.  Update $\eta_{k+1}$ using the rule above based on $\eta_k$ and $\hat{\lambda}_{\max, k}$.
    5.  Update parameters: $x_{k+1} = x_k - \eta_{k+1} m_{k+1}$.
*   **Noise Adaptation (Optional):** We may explore adapting injected noise (if any beyond inherent gradient stochasticity) based on the stability regime, potentially increasing exploration when stable and reducing it when near instability.

**3.3 Phase 3: Theoretical Analysis of AdaEoS**

We will analyze the properties of AdaEoS. This is challenging due to the adaptive learning rate and the non-convex nature of $L$.
*   **Stability Analysis:** We will analyze conditions under which the algorithm avoids divergence, potentially using Lyapunov function techniques adapted for stochastic, adaptive systems or by analyzing the expected behavior of the stability indicator $\sigma_k$.
*   **Convergence Analysis:** We aim to prove convergence (e.g., to a stationary point where $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla L(x)\|^2]$ is small) under suitable assumptions (e.g., smoothness, bounded noise variance, properties of $\lambda_{\max}$ estimation). The analysis will focus on demonstrating how maintaining $\sigma_k \approx 2$ leads to faster convergence compared to $\sigma_k \ll 2$. We might need to leverage techniques from adaptive gradient methods or stochastic approximation theory.

**3.4 Phase 4: Experimental Validation**

*   **Benchmarks:**
    *   *Vision:* ImageNet (or ImageNet-1k) classification using standard architectures like ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer (ViT-Base).
    *   *Language:* Language modeling on standard datasets like WikiText-103 or C4 using Transformer architectures (e.g., GPT-2 style models of varying sizes).
    *   *(Optional) Synthetic:* Controlled experiments on synthetic non-convex functions where EoS behavior can be studied more precisely.
*   **Baselines:**
    *   SGD with momentum (tuned optimal constant LR, and standard LR schedules like cosine decay).
    *   Adam / AdamW (tuned hyperparameters $\beta_1, \beta_2, \epsilon$, and LR schedule).
    *   Other relevant adaptive methods if applicable.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   *Primary:* Wall-clock time and number of training epochs/iterations to reach a target validation accuracy/perplexity.
    *   *Secondary:* Final validation accuracy/perplexity after a fixed compute budget (e.g., fixed time or epochs). Training loss curves.
    *   *Diagnostics:* Track $\eta_k$, estimated $\hat{\lambda}_{\max, k}$, the product $\sigma_k = \eta_k \hat{\lambda}_{\max, k}$, gradient norm $\|g_k\|$, and loss values $L(x_k)$ throughout training to verify the algorithm's behavior and stability. Measure the computational overhead per step due to $\hat{\lambda}_{\max, k}$ estimation.
*   **Implementation:** We will implement AdaEoS using a standard deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch) and release the code as open-source to facilitate reproducibility and adoption.
*   **Analysis:** We will carefully analyze the results, correlating the performance gains with the algorithm's ability to track the EoS boundary. We will investigate sensitivity to hyperparameters (e.g., $\gamma$, frequency of $\lambda_{\max}$ estimation, number of power iterations $J$). We aim to demonstrate the target 2-3x speedup in wall-clock time for large models.
