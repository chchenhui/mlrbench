# Research Proposal: Dynamical Insights into Edge of Stability Optimization for Large-Scale Deep Learning  

---

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in artificial intelligence, yet its practical implementation remains heavily reliant on empirical tuning rather than principled design. A critical gap persists between classical optimization theory and modern deep learning practice. Traditional convergence analyses assume idealized conditions (e.g., small learning rates, convex loss landscapes) that starkly contrast with the large learning rates, stochastic gradients, and non-convex objectives prevalent in real-world training pipelines. The **Edge of Stability (EoS)** phenomenon—where training dynamics oscillate near the boundary of stability while still minimizing loss—epitomizes this disconnect. Empirical studies (Cohen et al., 2021; Arora et al., 2022) reveal that neural network optimizers like gradient descent inherently operate in this regime, challenging classical stability assumptions. As deep learning enters the era of trillion-parameter models, understanding and leveraging EoS dynamics is critical to reducing the exorbitant computational costs of trial-and-error experimentation.  

### Research Objectives  
1. **Theoretical Analysis**: Characterize the interaction between gradient noise, curvature, and learning rate in the EoS regime through a continuous-time dynamical systems framework.  
2. **Algorithm Design**: Develop an adaptive optimization algorithm that dynamically balances stability and convergence speed by exploiting EoS dynamics.  
3. **Empirical Validation**: Demonstrate accelerated training for large-scale vision and language models while maintaining stable convergence.  

### Significance  
This work addresses a foundational question in modern machine learning: *How can we reconcile optimization theory with the empirical success of large learning rates and noisy gradients?* By bridging stochastic gradient dynamics, curvature analysis, and adaptive control, the proposed framework will provide mechanistic insights into EoS behavior. The resulting algorithm has the potential to reduce the computational burden of training foundation models by 2–3x, directly impacting the energy efficiency and accessibility of large-scale AI systems.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Dynamical Systems Modeling of EoS  

We model discrete-time gradient updates as a continuous-time stochastic process to analyze EoS dynamics. Let $\theta_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$ denote the model parameters at time $t$, and let $L(\theta)$ be the training loss. The gradient descent dynamics with learning rate $\eta$ and gradient noise $\xi_t$ can be approximated by the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE):  

$$
d\theta_t = -\eta \nabla L(\theta_t) dt + \sqrt{\eta \Sigma(\theta_t)} dW_t,  
$$  

where $W_t$ is a Wiener process, and $\Sigma(\theta_t)$ captures the covariance of gradient noise. The **maximum Hessian eigenvalue** $\lambda_{\text{max}}(\theta_t)$ determines local curvature. In the EoS regime, $\eta \lambda_{\text{max}}(\theta_t) \approx 2$ (Cohen et al., 2021), implying oscillatory dynamics near stability boundaries.  

**Analytical Approach**:  
1. **Phase-Plane Analysis**: Study the coupled dynamics of $\theta_t$ and $\lambda_{\text{max}}(\theta_t)$ under the SDE to derive conditions for stable oscillation.  
2. **Lyapunov Analysis**: Identify quasi-stationary distributions where oscillations around EoS do not compromise long-term convergence.  

### 2.2 Efficient Curvature Estimation  

Computing the full Hessian $\nabla^2 L(\theta_t)$ is infeasible for large models. We adopt a **randomized Neumann series approximation** (Xu et al., 2020) to estimate $\lambda_{\text{max}}(\theta_t)$:  

$$
\lambda_{\text{max}} \approx \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k v_i^\top \nabla^2 L(\theta_t) v_i,  
$$  

where $v_i$ are random vectors sampled from a Gaussian distribution. This reduces the computational cost from $O(d^2)$ to $O(kd)$ per iteration, where $k \ll d$.  

### 2.3 Adaptive Optimization Algorithm  

We propose the **Edge of Stability Adaptive Optimizer (EoS-Ada)**, which dynamically adjusts the learning rate $\eta_t$ and gradient noise scale $\sigma_t$ based on curvature feedback:  

1. **Learning Rate Adaptation**:  
   $$
   \eta_t = \frac{\alpha}{\lambda_{\text{max}}(\theta_t) + \epsilon},  
   $$  
   where $\alpha$ is a stability coefficient (initialized near 2 to encourage EoS) and $\epsilon$ prevents divergence.  

2. **Noise Modulation**: Scale gradient noise inversely with curvature to dampen oscillations:  
   $$
   \sigma_t = \beta \cdot \exp\left(-\gamma \lambda_{\text{max}}(\theta_t)\right),  
   $$  
   where $\beta, \gamma$ control exploration-exploitation balance.  

**Update Rule**:  
$$
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta_t \nabla L(\theta_t) + \sigma_t \xi_t, \quad \xi_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I).  
$$  

### 2.4 Experimental Design  

**Baselines**: Adam, SGD, and EoS-aware optimizers (e.g., StableAdam (Arora et al., 2022)).  

**Datasets & Models**:  
- Vision: ResNet-152 on ImageNet, ViT-Large on CIFAR-100.  
- Language: GPT-3 (125M) on Wikitext-103, BERT-base on GLUE.  

**Metrics**:  
1. **Training Dynamics**: Loss convergence speed, oscillatory behavior (measured via spectral analysis of loss trajectories).  
2. **Generalization**: Test accuracy, calibration error.  
3. **Efficiency**: Wall-clock time to target accuracy, memory/FLOPs overhead.  

**Statistical Validation**:  
- Run 5 trials with different seeds to assess variance.  
- Ablation studies on noise modulation and curvature estimation.
