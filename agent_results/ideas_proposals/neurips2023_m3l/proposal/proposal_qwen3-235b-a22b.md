# Dynamical Insights into Edge of Stability Optimization for Large-Scale Deep Learning  

## 1. Introduction  

### Background  
Deep Learning (DL) has achieved transformative successes in computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning (RL), yet its practical deployment remains highly empirical. Classical optimization theory, rooted in convex analysis and Lipschitz-smoothness assumptions (e.g., [3]), fails to explain critical phenomena such as the robust convergence of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with large learning rates or the mysterious generalization of overparametrized models. Modern DL trainings routinely exploit the Edge of Stability (EoS) regime ([1]), where gradient updates hover near numerical instability thresholds while minimizing non-convex losses—a behavior that defies traditional analysis. For instance, in EoS, the maximum Hessian eigenvalue $ \lambda_{\text{max}} $ of the loss landscape satisfies $ \eta \lambda_{\text{max}} \approx 2 $ (where $ \eta $ is the learning rate), leading to non-monotonic loss trajectories ([1]). However, theoretical tools to predict or control this regime remain nascent, resulting in computationally expensive hyperparameter tuning for billion-scale models.  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal addresses two core challenges in the mathematics of modern ML:  
1. **Theoretical Characterization**: Develop a continuous-time stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework to formalize the interaction between gradient noise, curvature, and EoS dynamics.  
2. **Algorithmic Innovation**: Design an adaptive optimization algorithm that stabilizes EoS training via curvature-informed updates, enabling faster convergence for large-scale models.  

### Significance  
1. **Reduction of Computational Waste**: Large-scale models (e.g., LLMs) require exascale compute for hyperparameter search. A principled understanding of EoS could eliminate reliance on trial-and-error, saving energy and costs.  
2. **Bridging Theory-Practice Divide**: By unifying geometric optimization theory (e.g., implicit bias [2]) with practical tools (e.g., Hessian estimation [4]), this work will provide guarantees for discrete flows near instability.  
3. **Scalability**: The proposed algorithm will be rigorously benchmarked on multimodal and vision/language tasks, directly tackling the scaling-laws challenge outlined in the workshop call.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Research Design  
This work bridges three threads: (1) Continuous approximation of discrete gradient dynamics via SDEs, (2) Curvature-aware stabilization, and (3) Empirical validation across modalities and scales.  

#### Continuous SDE Model for EoS Dynamics  
We model training as a stochastic process governed by:  
$$
d\theta_t = -\nabla L(\theta_t)dt + \epsilon(\theta_t) \, dW_t\,,
$$
where $ \theta_t \in \mathbb{R}^d $ is the parameter vector, $ W_t $ is Brownian motion modeling gradient noise, and $ \epsilon(\theta_t) $ captures the state-dependent noise intensity ([3]). To analyze EoS, we derive **effective potential landscapes** via Fokker-Planck equations ([3]). Key analytical steps include:  
1. Extending the linear-response approximation in [4] to non-convex $ L(\theta) $:  
   $$
   \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \left(\rho \nabla L + \frac{\epsilon^2}{2} \nabla \rho\right)\,,
   $$
   where $ \rho(\theta, t) $ is the parameter density.  
2. Identifying **stochastic stability thresholds** by analyzing the top eigenpair of the Fokker-Planck operator. Our hypothesis is that EoS corresponds to a metastable regime where gradient updates oscillate near saddle points of $ L(\theta) $.  

#### 2.2 Adaptive Optimization Algorithm  
We propose **Curvature-Adaptive Edge Optimization (CAEO)**, a dynamic learning rate schedule that modulates $ \eta_t $ via low-cost Hessian approximations:  

**Algorithm 1: Curvature-Adaptive Edge Optimization (CAEO)**  
1. At iteration $ t $, compute stochastic gradient:  
   $$
   g_t = \nabla L(\theta_t) + \xi_t\,,
   $$
   where $ \xi_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2) $.  
2. Estimate the curvature $ \lambda_t^{\text{max}} $ (detailed below) and update $ \eta_t $:  
   $$
   \eta_t = \min\left(\eta_{\text{base}}, \frac{2 - \delta}{\lambda_t^{\text{max}}} \right)\,,
   $$
   where $ \delta > 0 $ enforces a margin for numerical stability.  
3. Apply update:  
   $$
   \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta_t g_t\,.
   $$  

**Curvature Estimation**:  
- **Power Method for Dominant Eigenvalues**: Use Hessian-vector products with random test vectors $ v $:  
  $$
  \lambda_t^{\text{max}} \approx \max\{\mu_i: \mu_i = v^\top H_t v\}\,,
  $$
  where $ H_t = \nabla^2 L(\theta_t) $ and vectors $ v $ are drawn from rotation-invariant distributions.  
- **Efficient Implementation**:  
  For a model with 10M parameters, Hessian approximations exploit KFAC ([4]) or Hutchinson’s trace estimator ([2]) to reduce complexity from $ \mathcal{O}(d^2) $ to $ \mathcal{O}(d) $.  

#### 2.3 Experimental Design  

##### Datasets and Models  
1. **Small-Scale Benchmark**: CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50 (Vision) and Shakespeare-LM ([1]) with Transformer (Language).  
2. **Large-Scale Evaluation**: IN-1K with ViT-H/14 ([1]) and Pubmed with BERT-XXL (Language).  

##### Baselines and Metrics  
| Method                | Coverage                  |  
|-----------------------|---------------------------|  
| SGD + Momentum        | Standard practice         |  
| AdamW (default)       | Adaptive baseline         |  
| L4 ([4])              | Curvature-aware baseline  |  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
1. **Convergence Rate**: Epochs to reach 1% validation loss in classification, 8-bit perplexity in language modeling.  
2. **Stability**: Measured via $ \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \text{Var}(L(\theta_t)) $ over training.  
3. **Generalization**: Test accuracy and calibration scores.  
4. **Scalability**: Wall-clock time and FLOPs per sample.  

##### Ablation Studies  
1. **Curvature Estimation**: Compare KFAC vs. Hutchinson variants.  
2. **Stability Margin $ \delta $**: Sweep $ \delta \in [0.1, 0.5, 1.0] $.  
3. **Task Transfer**: Fine-tune chars74k ([1]) and ImageNet-21K with CAEO-pretrained weights.

## 3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Theoretical Contributions  
1. **SDE-Based EoS Theory**: Formalize conditions under which discrete SGD remains “metastable” in non-convex landscapes.  
2. **Implicit Bias Analysis**: Extend [2] to show how EoS dynamics select minima with flat Hessian spectra, improving generalization.  
3. **Deterministic-Stochastic Hybrid Flows**: Prove finite-time convergence for CAEO under non-convex $ L(\theta) $.  

### Practical Innovations  
1. **Open-Source Algorithm**: Release CAEO implementations with TensorFlow and JAX backends, targeting TPU and GPU clusters.  
2. **Reproducible Scaling**: Document 1.5–3.5× speedups over baselines for ViT-H and BERT-XL on standard hardware ([1]).  

### Broader Impact  
1. **Sustainability**: By reducing training iterations for large models, CAEO could cut carbon emissions by up to 40% compared to naive hyperparameter tuning.  
2. **Deployment Equity**: Empowers researchers in resource-limited settings to train complex models.  
3. **Theoretical Foundation**: Address workshop topics like “Scaling Laws” (via improved convergence analysis) and “Emergent Phenomena” (via stability-bound generalization).
