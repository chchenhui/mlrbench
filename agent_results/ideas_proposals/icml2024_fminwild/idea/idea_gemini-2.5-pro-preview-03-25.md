**Title:** Context-Adaptive Parameter Allocation for Efficient Foundation Model Deployment

**Motivation:** Deploying large foundation models (FMs) in real-world scenarios is often hindered by prohibitive computational costs and latency, especially on resource-constrained devices or under fluctuating workloads. Static compression or distillation methods lack adaptability to varying input complexities or system resources.

**Main Idea:** We propose a dynamic parameter allocation framework where only a contextually relevant subset of an FM's parameters is activated for each inference request. This involves developing a lightweight gating mechanism, trained concurrently or post-hoc, that predicts the importance of different model components (e.g., layers, attention heads, expert modules in MoE) based on the input query and current system constraints (e.g., latency budget, available memory). The system would route computation primarily through the selected components, significantly reducing FLOPs and latency for simpler queries while retaining the capacity for complex ones. Expected outcomes include drastically reduced average inference costs and improved responsiveness, making FMs more practical for diverse, resource-aware deployments without extensive model retraining.
