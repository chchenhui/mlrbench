Title: Dynamic Knowledge-Graph Grounding for Reliable Clinical Foundation Models

Motivation:  
In high-stakes domains like healthcare, foundation models (FMs) often hallucinate or propose unsafe recommendations when operating outside their training distribution. Embedding real-time domain knowledge into FMs can dramatically reduce errors and bolster clinician trust, yet existing methods struggle with latency, scalability, and traceability.

Main Idea:  
We propose a retrieval-augmented framework that dynamically grounds a pre-trained language FM to a continually updated clinical knowledge graph (KG). At inference time, a graph-neural-network module identifies the most relevant subgraph given the user prompt, encodes its entities and relations as attention biases, and feeds them back to the FM. We then fine-tune this system via a two-stage process: (1) supervised retrieval-augmented generation on curated clinical question–answer pairs, and (2) reinforcement learning from human feedback to penalize hallucinations and unsafe outputs.  
Expected outcomes include a significant reduction in factual errors (measured on MedQA and emrQA benchmarks), sub‐second response times, and end‐to‐end provenance for every generated statement. By ensuring reliability and transparency, this approach paves the way for safer, deployable clinical decision support tools.
