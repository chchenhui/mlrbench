**Title**: Lyapunov-Stable Reinforcement Learning for Robust Control Policies  

**Motivation**: Reinforcement learning (RL) lacks formal stability guarantees, limiting its adoption in safety-critical control systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, industrial automation). Bridging control theory’s stability frameworks with RL’s adaptability can enable reliable, high-performance policies for dynamic environments.  

**Main Idea**: Integrate Lyapunov stability theory into RL by jointly training policies and Lyapunov functions via neural networks. The policy network optimizes rewards while adhering to constraints derived from a learned Lyapunov function, ensuring state trajectories decrease the Lyapunov value (a stability certificate). Methodologically, employ constrained policy optimization, where the Lyapunov condition is enforced via a penalty or Lagrangian dual formulation. The Lyapunov network is trained concurrently to satisfy stability conditions across sampled states.  

**Expected Outcomes**: Provably stable RL policies for nonlinear systems, validated on control benchmarks (e.g., pendulum, robotics simulators). The framework would achieve comparable performance to unconstrained RL while guaranteeing bounded state deviations and robustness to perturbations.  

**Potential Impact**: Enables RL deployment in high-stakes control tasks by combining adaptability with formal safety guarantees, fostering trust in learned controllers. This synergy could redefine industrial automation and autonomous systems design.
