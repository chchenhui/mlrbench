### Title: "Theoretical Foundations of Neural Reinforcement Learning in Control Systems: Stability and Robustness"

### Motivation:
The integration of neural networks with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in solving complex control problems, but the lack of theoretical guarantees poses a significant challenge. This research aims to develop a robust theoretical framework that ensures the stability and robustness of neural RL algorithms in control systems, addressing the critical issue of applicability in high-stake domains such as industrial automation and adaptive transportation systems.

### Main Idea:
This research proposes a novel theoretical framework that combines the strengths of control theory and neural RL to provide stability and robustness guarantees. The methodology involves:
1. **Stability Analysis**: Extending Lyapunov-based stability analysis to neural RL algorithms, ensuring that the system's state remains within a predefined bound.
2. **Robustness Guarantees**: Developing robust control strategies that can handle perturbations and uncertainties, leveraging techniques from control theory such as model predictive control (MPC) and robust optimization.
3. **Data-Driven Modeling**: Utilizing data-driven approaches to model the system dynamics, allowing the algorithm to adapt to changing environments.
4. **Simulation and Empirical Validation**: Conducting extensive simulations and empirical studies to validate the theoretical guarantees in various control scenarios, including autonomous vehicles and industrial automation.

Expected outcomes include:
- A comprehensive theoretical framework that guarantees the stability and robustness of neural RL algorithms in control systems.
- Practical algorithms and control strategies that can be applied to real-world problems with high-stake implications.
- A deeper understanding of the interplay between control theory and neural RL, fostering collaborative research and development in this interdisciplinary field.

Potential impact:
- Enhanced reliability and safety in high-stake applications, such as autonomous vehicles, industrial processes, and adaptive transportation systems.
- New paradigms for integrating data-driven approaches with traditional control theory, leading to more efficient and adaptable control systems.
- A foundation for future research in developing more sophisticated and theoretically grounded neural RL algorithms for complex control problems.
