# Lyapunov-Stable Reinforcement Learning for Robust Control Policies  

## Introduction  

### Background  
Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in complex control tasks, from robotics to autonomous systems. However, its adoption in safety-critical domains—such as industrial automation, aerospace systems, and medical robotics—remains limited due to the lack of formal stability guarantees. Traditional control theory, in contrast, provides rigorous frameworks for ensuring system stability via Lyapunov functions, which mathematically certify that a system’s state converges to a desired equilibrium. Bridging these two paradigms—RL’s adaptability and control theory’s safety guarantees—represents a pivotal challenge in modern decision-making systems.  

Recent advances in neural Lyapunov function approximation (e.g., McCutcheon et al., 2025) and Lyapunov-constrained RL (e.g., Sun et al., 2023) have shown promise in integrating stability certificates into learning pipelines. However, existing methods often struggle with scalability to high-dimensional systems, computational efficiency, and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. For instance, while SAC-CLF (Chen et al., 2025) improves stability for nonlinear systems, its reliance on handcrafted Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) limits generalization. Similarly, distributed Lyapunov-based RL (Yao et al., 2024) addresses subsystem interactions but incurs communication overhead.  

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a unified framework for **Lyapunov-stable RL** that jointly learns control policies and Lyapunov functions through neural networks. The core objectives are:  
1. **Stability Guarantees**: Enforce Lyapunov stability conditions during policy optimization to ensure bounded state trajectories.  
2. **Adaptability**: Maintain RL’s capacity for reward maximization in dynamic environments while adhering to safety constraints.  
3. **Scalability**: Design computationally efficient algorithms for high-dimensional continuous-state and action spaces.  
4. **Robustness**: Validate performance under perturbations and model uncertainties, critical for real-world deployment.  

### Significance  
By merging RL’s data-driven optimization with control theory’s formal guarantees, this work addresses a critical barrier to deploying learned controllers in high-stakes applications. Success would enable:  
- **Safe Autonomous Systems**: Reliable operation of drones, self-driving cars, and industrial robots in unpredictable environments.  
- **Adaptive Industrial Control**: Real-time optimization of energy systems, chemical processes, and supply chains without compromising stability.  
- **Theoretical Synergy**: A foundational framework for cross-pollination between RL and control theory, advancing both fields.

## Methodology  

### Neural Architecture and Lyapunov Function Design  
We propose a dual-network architecture:  
1. **Policy Network**: A deep neural network $\pi_\theta: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{A}$ maps states $s_t \in \mathcal{S}$ to actions $a_t \in \mathcal{A}$.  
2. **Lyapunov Network**: A neural network $V_\phi: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ approximates the Lyapunov function, parameterized to satisfy $V_\phi(s) \geq 0$ and $V_\phi(s^*) = 0$ at the equilibrium $s^*$.  

**Lyapunov Constraint**: For discrete-time systems, stability requires:  
$$
V_\phi(s_{t+1}) - V_\phi(s_t) \leq -\gamma V_\phi(s_t), \quad \gamma \in (0, 1).
$$  
This ensures exponential decrease in the Lyapunov function, guaranteeing asymptotic stability.  

### Constrained Policy Optimization  
We frame policy learning as a constrained optimization problem:  
$$
\begin{aligned}
\max_{\theta} \quad & \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma_{\text{RL}}^t r(s_t, a_t)\right] \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \mathbb{E}\left[V_\phi(s_{t+1}) - (1 - \gamma)V_\phi(s_t)\right] \leq 0 \quad \forall t,
\end{aligned}
$$  
where $\gamma_{\text{RL}}$ is the RL discount factor. To enforce constraints, we employ a Lagrangian relaxation:  
$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi, \lambda) = \mathcal{J}_{\text{RL}}(\theta) + \lambda \cdot \mathbb{E}\left[V_\phi(s_{t+1}) - (1 - \gamma)V_\phi(s_t)\right] + \frac{1}{2}\mu \lambda^2,
$$  
where $\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier and $\mu$ a penalty coefficient.  

### Data Collection and Model-Based Acceleration  
To improve sample efficiency, we integrate a learned dynamics model $f_\psi: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{S}$, trained via supervised learning on collected transitions $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$. This model generates synthetic trajectories for:  
- **Imaginary Rollouts**: Accelerating Lyapunov constraint evaluation without real-world interaction.  
- **Adversarial Training**: Stress-testing policies under perturbed dynamics to enhance robustness.  

### Training Algorithm  
The algorithm alternates between policy updates and Lyapunov function refinement:  
1. **Initialize** $\theta, \phi, \psi, \lambda$.  
2. **For each iteration**:  
   a. Collect trajectories using $\pi_\theta$; update dynamics model $f_\psi$.  
   b. Compute policy gradients $\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}$ and Lyapunov gradients $\nabla_\phi \mathcal{L}$.  
   c. Update $\theta \leftarrow \theta + \eta_\theta \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}$, $\phi \leftarrow \phi - \eta_\phi \nabla_\phi \mathcal{L}$.  
   d. Update $\lambda \leftarrow \lambda + \eta_\lambda \cdot \text{constraint violation}$.  

### Experimental Design  
**Benchmarks**:  
- **Classic Control**: Pendulum swing-up, Cartpole, and Dubins vehicle.  
- **Robotics**: Quadrupedal locomotion (MuJoCo), robotic arm manipulation.  
- **Industrial Systems**: Chemical reactor control, power grid stabilization.  

**Baselines**:  
- Unconstrained RL (PPO, SAC).  
- Prior safe RL methods (SAC-CLF, Lyapunov MPC).  

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
1. **Stability**: Boundedness of states, Lyapunov function decay rate.  
2. **Performance**: Cumulative reward, task success rate.  
3. **Robustness**: Performance under sensor noise, actuator delays, and unmodeled dynamics.  
4. **Sample Efficiency**: Number of environment interactions to convergence.
