**Title:** Enhancing NLP Model Explainability through Theory of Mind-Driven Belief Tracking  

**Motivation:** Current NLP models often produce outputs without transparently reasoning about user intentions or knowledge states, limiting their trustworthiness and social alignment. Integrating Theory of Mind (ToM) can address this by enabling models to infer and adapt to users' mental states, improving both explanatory depth and task performance in human-AI interactions.  

**Main Idea:** This research proposes a ToM-aware language model that explicitly tracks user beliefs and intentions during dialogue or text generation. The framework employs recursive neural networks with hierarchical attention mechanisms to simulate belief updates, trained on conversation datasets annotated with speaker/listener mental states (e.g., intention, uncertainty). A reinforcement learning component rewards the model for generating explanations that resolve inferred user misunderstandings. Experiments will evaluate performance on goal-oriented dialogue and question-answering tasks, measuring explanation coherence via user studies and task success rates. Expected outcomes include models that proactively adjust outputs based on predicted user knowledge gaps, leading to more context-sensitive explanations and reduced communicative errors. If successful, this work could advance value-aligned AI by bridging ToM principles with interpretable NLP systems.
