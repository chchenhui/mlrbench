## **1. Title: Meta-Theory: A Meta-Learning Framework for Few-Shot Theory of Mind Adaptation in Conversational Agents**

---

## **2. Introduction**

### 2.1. Background

The quest for artificial intelligence (AI) that can interact naturally and effectively with humans is a central theme in contemporary research. Conversational agents, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, are increasingly integrated into daily life, serving roles in customer service, education, companionship, and information access. However, a significant limitation of current systems is their inability to understand and adapt to the nuanced mental states of individual human users – their beliefs, desires, intentions, knowledge, and emotions. This lack of sophisticated social reasoning, often referred to as Theory of Mind (ToM), results in interactions that can feel generic, impersonal, and sometimes frustratingly misaligned with the user's context or needs (Jafari et al., 2025).

Theory of Mind, the cognitive capacity to attribute mental states to oneself and others and to understand that others have mental states different from one's own, is fundamental to human social interaction, enabling empathy, prediction of behavior, and effective communication. Integrating computational ToM into AI, particularly conversational agents, holds immense promise for creating machines that are not just responsive but genuinely understanding and collaborative partners (Doe & Smith, 2024; Blue & Red, 2025).

Recent research has explored various avenues for equipping AI, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), with ToM capabilities. Approaches range from fine-tuning LLMs on ToM-specific data (Jafari et al., 2025), developing explicit symbolic reasoning modules (Sclar et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023), to designing agent architectures incorporating ToM for strategic interaction (Cross et al., 2024). These efforts underscore the growing recognition of ToM's importance. However, a critical challenge remains: enabling AI agents to *rapidly* and *efficiently* adapt their understanding to *new, unseen* users based on limited interaction data. Human social intelligence is characterized by this remarkable adaptability; we quickly form models of new acquaintances. Current AI systems typically require extensive user-specific data or fall back on population-level assumptions, hindering true personalization. The ability for few-shot adaptation of ToM is crucial for deploying socially intelligent agents in dynamic, real-world scenarios where they encounter diverse individuals.

### 2.2. Research Objectives

This research aims to address the challenge of rapid user adaptation by developing and evaluating **Meta-Theory**, a novel meta-learning framework designed to endow conversational agents with adaptable ToM capabilities. Our primary objectives are:

1.  **Develop a Meta-Learning Framework for Adaptive ToM:** Design and implement a framework comprising a lightweight ToM module integrated with a conversational agent, specifically utilizing Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) (Finn et al., 2017) to train the ToM module for fast adaptation.
2.  **Enable Few-Shot User Adaptation:** Demonstrate that the proposed Meta-Theory framework allows the conversational agent's ToM module to effectively infer and adapt to a new user's likely mental states (e.g., beliefs, goals, knowledge levels) after observing only a small number of conversational turns (few-shot learning).
3.  **Improve Dialogue Quality and Personalization:** Evaluate whether the adaptive ToM capabilities lead to measurable improvements in dialogue quality, specifically focusing on personalization, perceived empathy, contextual appropriateness, and task success in user interactions.
4.  **Establish Rigorous Evaluation Protocols:** Develop and apply a comprehensive evaluation methodology, combining simulated benchmarks and human user studies, to assess the performance of the Meta-Theory framework, drawing upon emerging standards for evaluating ToM in dialogue systems (White & Brown, 2023).

### 2.3. Significance

This research holds significant potential contributions to several fields, aligning strongly with the themes of the Workshop on Theory of Mind in Communicating Agents:

*   **Advancing Computational ToM:** It introduces a novel approach (meta-learning) specifically tailored for the challenge of *adapting* ToM models, complementing existing work focused on building foundational ToM capabilities (Sclar et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023). This addresses the critical need for models that generalize and personalize effectively (Johnson & Lee, 2024; Purple & Orange, 2023).
*   **Enhancing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):** By enabling agents to rapidly model user mental states, Meta-Theory can lead to more natural, empathetic, and personalized human-AI interactions. This improves user satisfaction, trust, and the overall quality of collaboration (Blue & Red, 2025).
*   **Improving NLP and Machine Learning Models:** The research provides a concrete methodology for integrating adaptive social reasoning into downstream NLP tasks like dialogue generation. It explores the synergy between ToM inference and language generation, potentially leading to more contextually aware and human-like language models.
*   **Foundation for Socially Aware AI:** Developing agents capable of few-shot ToM adaptation is a step towards creating more socially intelligent AI systems that can navigate complex social dynamics responsibly. While acknowledging ethical considerations (Literature Review Challenge 5), this research lays groundwork for AI that better understands human perspectives.
*   **Addressing Key Challenges:** This work directly tackles the challenges of generalization across users (Challenge 2) and balancing adaptation speed with stability (Challenge 3) by leveraging the strengths of meta-learning. While synthetic data is used initially, the focus on fast adaptation aims to reduce reliance on extensive, potentially biased, annotated data (Challenge 1) for *new* users. The emphasis on rigorous evaluation contributes to addressing the need for better metrics and benchmarks (Challenge 4).

By focusing on few-shot adaptation through meta-learning, this proposal explores a promising direction for making ToM practical and effective in real-world conversational AI applications.

## **3. Methodology**

Our research methodology comprises five interconnected phases: Data Generation and Annotation, ToM Module Pretraining, Meta-Learning for Adaptation, Deployment and Joint Optimization, and Experimental Evaluation.

### 3.1. Research Design Overview

We will adopt a multi-stage approach:
1.  **Simulated Environment:** Develop a method to generate synthetic dialogue data annotated with ground-truth latent mental states. This provides controlled data for initial training and evaluation.
2.  **Model Development:** Design and implement the Meta-Theory framework, including the ToM module and its integration with a dialogue generation model.
3.  **Training:** Pretrain the ToM module on the synthetic corpus, followed by meta-training using MAML to optimize for few-shot adaptation.
4.  **Evaluation:** Conduct rigorous experiments using both simulated benchmarks (controlled conditions, objective metrics) and human user studies (real-world interaction, subjective metrics).

### 3.2. Phase 1: Synthetic Dialogue Generation and Annotation

Addressing the challenge of obtaining large-scale dialogue data annotated with fine-grained mental states (Challenge 1), we will initially focus on synthetic data generation.

*   **Dialogue Simulation:** We will design simulation scenarios representing common conversational contexts (e.g., collaborative problem-solving, information seeking, pedagogical interactions). We will define simulated agents (users and system) with internal states, including:
    *   **Beliefs:** Propositions held to be true (potentially incorrect or incomplete). Represented possibly as knowledge graphs or sets of predicates.
    *   **Goals:** Desired end-states for the interaction or specific tasks.
    *   **Knowledge:** Domain-specific information possessed by the agent, including awareness of the other agent's likely knowledge (or lack thereof).
*   **Generation Process:** Dialogues will be generated based on agents pursuing their goals according to their beliefs, potentially using rule-based systems or by prompting large language models conditioned on agent profiles and goals. Crucially, the generation process will explicitly track the evolution of each agent's mental state turn-by-turn based on the dialogue context.
*   **Annotation:** The simulator will automatically output multi-turn dialogues paired with time-step annotations of the "user" agent's mental state (beliefs $B_t$, goals $G_t$, knowledge $K_t$ at turn $t$). This provides the ground truth for training the ToM module. We aim to generate a diverse corpus covering various user profiles and interaction dynamics.

### 3.3. Phase 2: ToM Module Pretraining

*   **Architecture:** The ToM module will be designed as a neural network, likely based on a Transformer encoder architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) like LSTM.
    *   **Input:** Dialogue history $H_t = (u_1, r_1, u_2, r_2, ..., u_t)$, where $u_i$ are user utterances and $r_i$ are system responses.
    *   **Output:** A latent representation $z_t^{ToM}$ intended to capture the user's inferred mental state at turn $t$. This representation will then be mapped to predict specific aspects of the annotated mental state (e.g., key beliefs, current goal).
*   **Pretraining Objective:** The ToM module will be pretrained on the large synthetic corpus generated in Phase 1. The objective will be to minimize a loss function comparing the module's predictions with the ground-truth annotations. For example, using cross-entropy loss for categorical goals or belief states, or a similarity loss for belief representations.
    $$ \mathcal{L}_{pretrain} = \mathbb{E}_{(H_t, M_t) \sim \mathcal{D}_{synth}} [\text{Loss}(f_{ToM}(H_t; \theta), M_t)] $$
    where $f_{ToM}$ is the ToM module parameterized by $\theta$, $M_t = (B_t, G_t, K_t)$ represents the ground-truth mental state annotation from the synthetic dataset $\mathcal{D}_{synth}$.

### 3.4. Phase 3: Meta-Learning for Adaptation (MAML)

This phase applies Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) (Finn et al., 2017) to the pretrained ToM module parameters $\theta$ to learn an initialization that is highly adaptable to new users with few examples. MAML aligns well with our goal of few-shot adaptation (Johnson & Lee, 2024; Purple & Orange, 2023; Green & Black, 2024).

*   **Meta-Learning Setup:**
    *   **Tasks:** During meta-training, a "task" $\mathcal{T}_i$ corresponds to learning the ToM for a specific simulated user $i$. Each task $\mathcal{T}_i$ has a small support set $D_i^{supp}$ (K-shot examples, e.g., first $K$ turns of dialogues with user $i$) and a query set $D_i^{query}$ (subsequent turns from the same user $i$).
    *   **MAML Objective:** The goal is to find initial parameters $\theta$ such that a few gradient steps on the support set $D_i^{supp}$ of a new task $\mathcal{T}_i$ lead to parameters $\phi_i$ that perform well on the query set $D_i^{query}$.

*   **MAML Algorithm:**
    1.  Sample a batch of tasks $\{\mathcal{T}_i\}$.
    2.  For each task $\mathcal{T}_i$:
        a.  Initialize adapted parameters $\phi_i = \theta$.
        b.  Compute the task-specific loss $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(\phi_i)$ on the support set $D_i^{supp}$.
        c.  Perform one or more gradient descent steps (inner loop) to update the parameters for this specific task:
            $$ \phi'_i = \phi_i - \alpha \nabla_{\phi_i} \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}( \phi_i, D_i^{supp}) $$
            (Potentially multiple inner steps)
    3.  Update the meta-parameters $\theta$ (outer loop) based on the performance of the adapted parameters $\phi'_i$ on the query sets $D_i^{query}$:
        $$ \theta \leftarrow \theta - \beta \nabla_{\theta} \sum_{\mathcal{T}_i} \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(\phi'_i, D_i^{query}) $$
    Here, $\alpha$ is the inner loop learning rate, and $\beta$ is the outer loop (meta) learning rate. The loss $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}$ is the same ToM prediction loss used during pretraining, but calculated on the specific task's data.

### 3.5. Phase 4: Deployment and Joint Optimization

*   **Integration with Dialogue Generation:** The adapted ToM module $f_{ToM}(H_t; \phi_i)$ (with user-specific parameters $\phi_i$ obtained via MAML adaptation) needs to influence the dialogue generation process. We will explore several integration strategies:
    *   **Conditional Generation:** Use the ToM state representation $z_t^{ToM}$ as additional input/context to the dialogue generation model (e.g., a pretrained LLM like GPT or LLaMA, potentially fine-tuned). The generator predicts the next response $r_t$ conditioned on both dialogue history $H_t$ and the inferred user mental state $z_t^{ToM}$: $P(r_t | H_t, z_t^{ToM})$.
    *   **Response Ranking/Modification:** Use the ToM inference to re-rank candidate responses generated by a base model or to modify generation parameters (e.g., adjusting politeness, simplifying explanations if low user knowledge is inferred).
*   **Online Adaptation:** During interaction with a *new* user, the system starts with the meta-learned parameters $\theta$. After the first few ($K$) turns, it performs the MAML inner-loop update using these $K$ turns as the support set to obtain adapted parameters $\phi_{new\_user}$. This adaptation process can potentially be repeated periodically as the conversation progresses.
*   **Joint Objective (Optional Fine-tuning):** Explore fine-tuning the dialogue generator and/or the ToM adaptation process jointly using reinforcement learning, where rewards are given for task success, user satisfaction signals (if available), or consistency between ToM predictions and subsequent user actions/responses.

### 3.6. Phase 5: Experimental Design and Evaluation

We will employ a mixed-methods evaluation approach, combining automated metrics on simulated data with human judgments from user studies.

*   **Simulated Benchmarks:**
    *   **Setup:** Create test sets of simulated users/dialogues distinct from the training/meta-training sets.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **ToM Inference Accuracy:** Measure the accuracy of the adapted ToM module in predicting held-out ground-truth mental states (beliefs, goals) from the simulation.
        *   **Adaptation Speed:** Quantify how many interaction turns ($K$) are needed for the Meta-Theory agent's ToM accuracy and downstream task performance to reach a certain threshold or saturate. Compare against baselines requiring more data.
        *   **Task Success Rate:** For task-oriented dialogues, measure the rate of successful task completion.
        *   **Dialogue Quality Metrics:** Use standard NLP metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, Perplexity for generated responses, acknowledging their limitations for evaluating nuanced aspects like empathy.
*   **Human User Studies:**
    *   **Setup:** Recruit human participants to interact with different versions of the conversational agent in controlled tasks (e.g., collaborative puzzle solving, personalized recommendations, empathetic support scenario). A within-subjects or between-subjects design will be used.
    *   **Conditions:** Compare the full Meta-Theory agent (with few-shot adapted ToM) against baseline conditions:
        1.  **No ToM:** A strong dialogue model baseline without any explicit ToM module.
        2.  **Static ToM:** Agent with the pretrained ToM module but *without* MAML-based adaptation (uses average/prior parameters $\theta$).
        3.  **Standard Fine-tuning:** An agent where the ToM module is fine-tuned conventionally on the initial turns (requires more data or slower adaptation than MAML).
    *   **Metrics (following White & Brown, 2023 where applicable):**
        *   **Subjective User Ratings (Likert Scales):** Perceived Personalization, Empathy, Understanding, Trustworthiness, Naturalness, Overall Satisfaction.
        *   **Task-based Metrics:** Task Completion Rate, Time to Completion, Efficiency (e.g., number of turns).
        *   **Qualitative Analysis:** Analyze dialogue transcripts for instances of successful/failed adaptation, empathetic responses, misunderstandings, and user strategies. Coder agreement will be assessed.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** Appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) will be used to compare the performance across different conditions and assess the significance of findings.

### 4.1. Expected Outcomes

1.  **A Functional Meta-Theory Framework:** The primary outcome will be a working implementation of the Meta-Theory framework, including the synthetic data generator, the pretrained ToM module, the MAML adaptation mechanism, and its integration with a dialogue generation model. The codebase will be made available to the research community.
2.  **Empirical Validation of Few-Shot ToM Adaptation:** We expect experimental results demonstrating that the Meta-Theory agent significantly outperforms baselines in terms of adaptation speed and accuracy in inferring new users' mental states based on limited interaction data (K < 10 turns).
3.  **Demonstrated Improvements in Dialogue Quality:** We anticipate that human evaluation studies will show statistically significant improvements for the Meta-Theory agent compared to baselines regarding perceived personalization, empathy, user satisfaction, and potentially task success rates in interactive scenarios.
4.  **Insights into Meta-Learning for Social Reasoning:** The research will provide valuable insights into the applicability and effectiveness of meta-learning paradigms, specifically MAML, for complex social reasoning tasks like ToM adaptation in AI agents.
5.  **Refined Evaluation Methodology:** Contribution of a structured evaluation protocol combining simulated and human-centric metrics for assessing adaptive ToM capabilities in conversational agents, building upon existing work (White & Brown, 2023).

### 4.2. Impact

*   **Scientific Impact:** This research will advance the state-of-the-art in computational Theory of Mind, particularly addressing the underexplored area of rapid adaptation. It will contribute novel techniques to the fields of meta-learning, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction. By demonstrating a viable method for few-shot ToM, it opens avenues for future research into more sophisticated and dynamic social reasoning in AI. It directly addresses core themes of the ToM 2025 workshop, including leveraging ToM for NLP/ML applications and ToM for HCI/Human-AI collaboration.
*   **Practical Impact:** The Meta-Theory framework has the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities of practical conversational AI systems. Applications include:
    *   **Personalized Customer Service:** Agents that quickly understand customer history and frustration levels.
    *   **Adaptive Educational Tutors:** systems that infer student knowledge gaps and misconceptions from dialogue.
    *   **Empathetic Healthcare Companions:** Virtual agents that adapt to patients' emotional states and beliefs.
    *   **Improved Human-AI Teaming:** AI collaborators that better anticipate human teammates' intentions and needs.
*   **Social Impact:** By fostering AI that is more attuned to human mental states, this research contributes to the development of more positive and beneficial human-AI relationships (Blue & Red, 2025). Agents capable of rapid empathy and understanding could have positive social impacts, particularly in areas like mental health support and education. However, we also recognize the importance of responsible development. The ability to infer user states necessitates careful consideration of privacy and potential misuse (Challenge 5). Our evaluation will include qualitative analysis pertinent to these ethical dimensions, and future work should focus on developing safeguards alongside capabilities.

In conclusion, the proposed Meta-Theory framework offers a principled and promising approach to instill conversational agents with the crucial ability to rapidly adapt their understanding of diverse human users, paving the way for more personalized, effective, and socially intelligent AI systems.
