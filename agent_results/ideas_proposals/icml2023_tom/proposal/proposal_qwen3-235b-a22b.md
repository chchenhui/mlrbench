# Meta-Theory: A Meta-Learning Framework for ToM in Conversational AI

## Introduction

### Background  
Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer and track the mental states of agents, remains a critical but underdeveloped capability in conversational AI. Despite the advent of large language models (LLMs) with linguistic fluency, dialogue systems often fail to dynamically adapt to users' latent beliefs, intentions, or knowledge gaps, resulting in repetitive or contextually irrelevant responses [1]. For instance, while architectures like MindDial [4] demonstrate ToM-enhanced neural dialogue generation, they rely on static belief representations unsuitable for real-time adaptation. Similarly, "Hypothetical Minds" [2] excels in multi-agent settings but struggles to scale to personalized human-AI interactions. This gap is exacerbated in low-resource scenarios where users cannot provide extensive training data to condition responses on their unique mental models.

### Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to address these limitations through **Meta-Theory**, a meta-learning framework that rapidly adapts ToM capabilities to individual users. Specifically, we will:  
1. Develop a synthetic dialogue generation pipeline with precise annotations of latent mental states (belief, goal, knowledge).  
2. Train a lightweight ToM module using Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to enable few-shot adaptation.  
3. Integrate the ToM module with a dialogue model via reinforcement learning (RL), rewarding responses that align with users' inferred mental states.  
4. Evaluate the framework on both simulated benchmarks and live user studies, focusing on adaptation speed, empathy metrics, and task success.  

### Significance  
Our work directly aligns with the ToM 2025 workshop's themes:  
- **Cognitive Foundations**: Advances in structured ToM modeling (e.g., "SymbolicToM" [3]) inspire our knowledge graph-based mental state tracking.  
- **HCI Applications**: Personalization through rapid ToM adaptation enhances human-AI collaboration [6].  
- **Social Impact**: Improved empathetic responses support applications in education and mental health [9].  
By addressing data, technical, and ethical challenges (~\nameref{sec:challenges}), Meta-Theory could set a foundation for socially aware AI capable of dynamic human-centric interactions.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing  

#### Synthetic Dialogue Construction  
To overcome the labor-intensive nature of manual ToM annotation [1], we employ a **teacher-agent paradigm** to generate a synthetic corpus:  
1. **Knowledge Graph Agents**: Two reinforcement learners simulate speakers and listeners with distinct, structured mental states. The speaker's knowledge graph $ G_s = (V, E_s) $ encodes facts known only to them (e.g., "meeting location is Building A"), while the listener's graph $ G_l = (V, E_l) $ avoids $ E_l \ni F_{exclusive} $ in task-relevant contexts.  
2. **Dialogue Policies**: The teacher agent samples from dialogue policies that prioritize clarity, deception, or ambiguity to maximize diversity in mental state reasoning. For example:  
   - **Deception Policy**: The speaker withholds $ G_s $ details, forcing the listener to infer missing knowledge.  
   - **Clarity Policy**: Explicit updates to $ G_l $ via statements like "I’ve moved the meeting to 3 PM."  
3. **Annotation Protocol**: Trajectories are annotated with:  
   - Ground-truth belief gaps: $ \|G_s \oplus G_l\|_1 $ (graph symmetric difference norm).  
   - Goal misalignments: $ \min_t \|g_l^{(t)} - g_s^{(t')}\| $ between episode steps $ t, t' $.  
   - Language conventions: Part-of-speech tagged edits to standardize expression variability.  

### Model Architecture  

#### Meta-Learning Framework  
The Meta-Theory pipeline comprises three components (Figure 1):  

1. **ToM Inference Module**:  
   - A graph neural network (GNN) predicts latent states $ z_i $ for each interlocutor:  
     $$z_i = \text{GNN}(\text{History}_{1:i}, \text{EntityGraph}_{1:i})$$  
     where $ \text{EntityGraph} $ stores dynamic attributes like ownership or emotional valence.  
   - A recurrent neural network (RNN) models belief propagation:  
     $$b_{i+1} = \text{RNN}(b_i, z_{i+1}, \text{Action}_i)$$  

2. **Dialogue Model**:  
   - A pre-trained LLM (e.g., LLaRA) generates responses $ r_t \sim p_\theta(r | b_{t-1}, \text{Query}_t) $.  

3. **Meta-Controller**:  
   - Parametrized by $ \theta $, this module performs rapid adaptation via MAML [10]:  
     $$\theta' = \theta - \beta \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_\text{adaptation}(\theta)$$  
     where $ \mathcal{L}_\text{adaptation} $ is task-specific (e.g., belief error or task completion reward).  

#### Training Procedure  

1. **Pretraining on Synthetic Data**:  
   - Jointly train the ToM module and LLM on the synthetic corpus using a multi-task loss:  
     $$\mathcal{L}_\text{total} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_\text{language} + (1-\alpha)\mathcal{L}_\text{ToM}$$  
     where $ \alpha \in [0,1] $.  

2. **MAML Meta-Training**:  
   - Sample tasks $ T_i $ from diverse domains (cooperative, deceptive, instructional).  
   - Inner loop: Adapt $ \theta $ to $ T_i $ via gradient updates using $ \log p(r_i | T_i, \theta) $.  
   - Outer loop: Update meta-parameters to minimize hold-out loss:  
     $$\theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \nabla_\theta \sum_{T_i} \mathcal{L}_{T_i}(f_{\theta_i'})$$  

3. **Deployment Adaptation**:  
   - For a new user $ u $, initialize $ \theta_u = \theta $, then update $ \theta_u $ using $ O(5) $ user interactions.

### Experimental Design  

#### Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks  
We assess Meta-Theory on:  

1. **Synthetic Benchmarks**:  
   - **ToM-Accuracy**: Proportion of belief/knowledge gaps correctly inferred.  
   - **Task Success Rate**: Defined per domain (e.g., object manipulation, task completion).  

2. **Natural Language Benchmarks**:  
   - **ToMi**: Zero-shot ToM reasoning on the ToMi benchmark [3].  
   - **MultiwozToM**: A novel adaptation of Multiwoz with annotated user belief states.  

3. **User Studies**:  
   - **Perceived Empathy**: 5-point Likert scale (1=fed up, 5=understood).  
   - **Recall Flows**: Measure if users share more personal details over time.  

#### Baseline Comparisons  
Compare against:  
- **MindDial**: Specializes in belief tracking but lacks adaptation mechanisms [4].  
- **Hypothetical Minds**: Strong multi-agent ToM but static population assumptions [2].  
- **MAML-Only**: LLM fine-tuned via MAML without explicit ToM supervision.

## Expected Outcomes & Impact  

### Technical Contributions  
1. **Meta-Theoretic Adaptation**: We anticipate demonstrating that $ O(10) $ interactions suffice for the ToM module to infer user mental states with $ \geq 90\% $ accuracy on synthetic benchmarks.  
2. **Human-Centric Gains**: User studies will confirm a $ \geq 30\% $ increase in perceived empathy relative to baselines, alongside $ \geq 40\% $ higher task success rates.  
3. **Framework Innovation**: The hybrid GNN-to-LLM modular design will enable easy transfer to third-party conversational agents, connecting symbolic ToM [3] with neural architectures.  

### Societal Impact  
Meta-Theory’s ability to rapidly adapt to individual users has dual-use implications:  
- **Positive Applications**: Mental health chatbots [9] could personalize strategies via real-time inference of user emotional states. For example, detecting frustration $ b_\text{user}(\text{anxiety}) > \tau $ and adapting dialogue to employ de-escalation techniques.  
- **Ethical Safeguards**: To mitigate manipulation risks [10], we propose transparency interfaces showing inferred beliefs (e.g., "I noticed you mentioned anxiety four times—would you like to discuss?").  

### Research Directions  
1. **Domain Transfer**: Extend Meta-Theory to multi-turn reasoning in embodied environments (e.g., robotics).  
2. **Privacy-Preserving Adaptation**: Integrate federated learning or differential privacy during MAML phase.  
3. **Clinical Validation**: Collaborate with psychologists to assess therapeutic efficacy metrics like the PHQ-9 depression scale.  

By bridging meta-learning and ToM, this work could advance personalized human-AI interaction paradigms, answering the workshop’s call for tools that "explain NLP and ML models" and "leverage ToM for positive social impact" [original task].
