**Title:** Uncertainty-Aware Decoding for Mitigating Hallucinations in LLMs

**Motivation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect statements (hallucinations), critically limiting their reliability. We need methods to identify and mitigate these hallucinations *during* the generation process, rather than relying solely on post-hoc checks.

**Main Idea:** We propose an "Uncertainty-Aware Decoding" (UAD) mechanism integrated into the LLM's generation loop. UAD monitors token-level uncertainty metrics (e.g., predictive entropy, variance via MC dropout, or disagreement within a lightweight ensemble) at each decoding step. When uncertainty for a potential next token or sequence surpasses a dynamically adjusted threshold, suggesting a high risk of hallucination, the UAD module intervenes. Interventions could include: 1) Constraining the sampling distribution to tokens consistent with retrieved factual evidence, 2) Re-ranking candidate tokens to favor lower-uncertainty options, or 3) Injecting a special token indicating potential unreliability. We will evaluate UAD on factual benchmarks (e.g., QA, summarization), measuring reductions in hallucination rates against baseline decoding methods, while assessing impacts on generation quality and computational overhead. This approach aims to proactively reduce factual errors by leveraging the model's own uncertainty signals.
