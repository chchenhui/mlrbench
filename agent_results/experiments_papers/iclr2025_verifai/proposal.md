## 1. Title
LLM-Guided Tactic Autogeneration for Interactive Theorem Provers

## 2. Introduction

### Background
Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP) is a cornerstone of formal verification, enabling the rigorous proof of mathematical properties and software correctness. However, the manual process of tactic engineering, which involves the creation and application of proof strategies, is labor-intensive and time-consuming. This bottleneck hinders the adoption of formal methods in large-scale software development and mathematical libraries.

### Research Objectives
The primary objective of this research is to develop a framework, LLM-TAC, that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation and refinement of proof tactics for ITP systems such as Coq or Lean. The specific goals include:
1. **Contextual Encoding**: Accurately encode the proof state, including goals, hypotheses, and relevant libraries, using a retrieval-augmented transformer.
2. **Tactic Generation & Verification**: Generate candidate tactic sequences, execute them within the prover, and log successful sequences as training data while generating counterexamples from failures.
3. **Reinforcement Loop**: Apply reinforcement learning (RL) from proof feedback to iteratively improve the accuracy of tactic generation.

### Significance
Automating tactic discovery can dramatically accelerate proof development, reduce the burden on human experts, and broaden the adoption of formal methods. By fusing probabilistic generation with formal verification checks, LLM-TAC can substantially lower the barrier to ITP, paving the way toward scalable, AI-driven proof engineering.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Contextual Encoding
For each proof obligation, we encode the goal state, local hypotheses, and project libraries using a retrieval-augmented transformer. This involves:
1. **Goal State Encoding**: Represent the current proof state, including the main goal and intermediate subgoals.
2. **Hypotheses Encoding**: Encode the local hypotheses and assumptions available in the current proof context.
3. **Library Encoding**: Retrieve relevant theorems and lemmas from the project libraries that are potentially useful for the current proof.

The encoding process can be formalized as follows:
\[ \text{Goal State} = f(G, S) \]
where \( G \) is the main goal and \( S \) is the set of subgoals. The hypotheses and library encoding can be represented similarly.

### 3.2 Tactic Generation & Verification
The LLM proposes candidate tactic sequences, which are mechanically executed inside the prover. This process involves:
1. **Tactic Generation**: The LLM generates a sequence of tactics based on the encoded proof state.
2. **Execution**: Each tactic in the sequence is executed within the prover to attempt to close subgoals.
3. **Verification**: The success of each tactic sequence is evaluated by checking if it successfully closes subgoals. Successful sequences are logged as new training data, while failing ones generate counterexamples.

The process can be represented as:
\[ \text{Tactic Sequence} = g(\text{Goal State}) \]
where \( g \) is the LLM's generation function. The verification step can be formalized as:
\[ \text{Success} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if subgoals are closed} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \]

### 3.3 Reinforcement Loop
We apply reinforcement learning from proof feedback to iteratively improve the accuracy of tactic generation. This involves:
1. **Reward Function**: Define a reward function that assigns a positive reward for successful tactic sequences and a negative reward for failures.
2. **Policy Update**: Update the LLM's policy based on the feedback received from the prover. This can be done using techniques such as policy gradient methods or Q-learning.

The reinforcement loop can be formalized as:
\[ \pi_{\theta} \leftarrow \pi_{\theta} + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) \]
where \( \pi_{\theta} \) is the current policy, \( \alpha \) is the learning rate, and \( J(\theta) \) is the expected return.

### 3.4 Experimental Design
To validate the method, we will use standard Coq benchmarks such as mathcomp and stdlib. The evaluation metrics include:
1. **Tactic Generation Accuracy**: The percentage of generated tactics that are syntactically correct and semantically meaningful.
2. **Proof Completion Time**: The time taken to complete proofs using the generated tactics compared to manual tactics.
3. **Reduction in Manual Tactic Writing**: The percentage reduction in manual tactic writing on standard benchmarks.

## 4. Expected Outcomes & Impact

### Expected Outcomes
1. **50% Reduction in Manual Tactic Writing**: Achieve a significant reduction in the amount of manual tactic writing required on standard Coq benchmarks (mathcomp, stdlib).
2. **Public Release of Trained Models and Scripts**: Make the trained models and scripts available for integration into existing ITP systems.

### Potential Impact
By fusing probabilistic generation with formal verification checks, LLM-TAC can substantially lower the barrier to ITP, paving the way toward scalable, AI-driven proof engineering. This can lead to:
1. **Broadened Adoption**: Increase the adoption of formal methods in large-scale software development and mathematical libraries by reducing the manual effort required.
2. **Improved Efficiency**: Enhance the efficiency of proof development by automating tactic discovery and refinement.
3. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Facilitate better collaboration between human experts and AI systems in formal proof development.

## Conclusion
The LLM-TAC framework represents a significant step towards automating the generation and refinement of proof tactics in interactive theorem provers. By leveraging the power of LLMs and reinforcement learning, we aim to reduce the manual effort required in ITP and enhance the scalability and efficiency of formal verification processes.
