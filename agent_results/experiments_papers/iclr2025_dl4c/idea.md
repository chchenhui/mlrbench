Title: Human-AI Co-Adaptation Loops for Personalized Code Assistants

Motivation:  
While large language models demonstrate impressive code generation abilities, current systems often fail to adapt to individual developer workflows, preferences, or coding habits. This limitation reduces developer productivity and can lead to friction in human-AI code collaboration. Enabling AI code assistants to continuously learn from and adapt to unique users—while allowing developers to influence and refine model behavior—remains an open challenge at the intersection of deep learning, HCI, and software engineering.

Main Idea:  
We propose a research framework for “human-AI co-adaptation loops” in code assistants. Our approach incorporates lightweight, in-situ multi-modal user feedback (e.g., code edits, voice commands, explicit UI controls) during everyday coding. We employ online and meta-learning techniques to personalize model responses in real time, while enabling users to directly shape model behavior through interventions. The methodology involves (1) designing plug-ins for popular IDEs to collect rich feedback, (2) developing algorithms for rapid model updates based on streaming user data, and (3) evaluating productivity and user satisfaction through controlled studies and real-world deployment. Anticipated outcomes include measurable gains in code correctness, development speed, and user perceived alignment—along with insights into responsible, privacy-preserving adaptation. This paradigm has the potential to set new standards for human-AI collaboration in programming.
