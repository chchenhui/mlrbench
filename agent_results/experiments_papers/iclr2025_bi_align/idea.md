**Title:** **Dynamic Human-AI Co-Adaptation via Real-Time Feedback-Driven Alignment**  

**Motivation:**  
Traditional AI alignment methods treat alignment as a static, one-way process, where AI systems are trained offline using fixed human preferences. However, real-world human-AI interactions are inherently dynamic: user preferences evolve, contextual conditions shift, and bidirectional adaptation is critical for sustained trust and effectiveness. Failing to address this leaves AI systems misaligned over time, risking user disengagement or harmful outcomes. This research tackles the challenge of *real-time, bidirectional alignment* to enable AI systems that adapt to evolving human needs while empowering users to actively shape AI behavior.  

**Main Idea:**  
We propose a framework combining **online reinforcement learning (RL) with interpretable human feedback loops** to enable continuous co-adaptation. The system incrementally updates its policy in real time as users interact with it, leveraging multimodal feedback (e.g., natural language corrections, implicit behavioral cues). Simultaneously, it generates human-centric explanations of how specific feedback influences AI decisions, fostering user awareness and control. To address non-stationarity, we will design a hybrid RL-imitation learning architecture that balances adaptation to new data with retention of prior alignment objectives. Evaluation will involve longitudinal user studies in dynamic task domains (e.g., collaborative robotics, personalized recommendation systems) to measure alignment persistence, user trust, and system adaptability. By harmonizing AI-centered learning with human-centered transparency, this work aims to establish a blueprint for resilient, context-aware bidirectional alignment frameworks, directly advancing applications in health, education, and ethical AI deployment.
