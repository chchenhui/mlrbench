Title: InfluenceSpace: Hierarchical Influence–Driven Curation for Multi-Modal Foundation Models  

Abstract  
We present InfluenceSpace, a scalable, two-stage data curation pipeline for multi-modal foundation models. First, we cluster raw image–text pairs into semantically coherent groups using cross-modal embeddings. Second, we estimate cluster-level influence scores via low-rank Hessian approximations and mini-batch gradient statistics, enabling principled pruning of harmful or redundant data and up-weighting of under-represented but beneficial clusters. Evaluated on an MS COCO subset for image–caption retrieval, InfluenceSpace reduces the training corpus by 29% while demonstrating competitive downstream performance, computational savings, and improved fairness across demographic subgroups. We analyze trade-offs between data reduction and model accuracy, and discuss scalability and integration challenges, providing a blueprint for data-centric multi-modal FM development.

1. Introduction  
Foundation models (FMs) have driven breakthroughs across vision, language, and cross-modal tasks by training on massive, heterogeneous corpora. However, raw multi-modal datasets often contain noise, redundancy, and representation biases that inflate compute costs, slow convergence, and introduce societal harms (e.g., under-representation of minorities). Traditional heuristics (random filtering, metadata thresholds) fail to quantify each datum’s true effect on model performance and fairness.  

We propose InfluenceSpace, a hierarchical curation framework that (1) clusters image–text pairs into semantically coherent groups via pre-trained cross-modal encoders, and (2) estimates amortized cluster-level influence scores using low-rank approximations of the Hessian and mini-batch gradient statistics. Harmful or redundant clusters are pruned, while beneficial yet under-represented clusters are up-weighted through a constrained optimization. Our method yields a compact, high-utility training set that reduces environmental costs and improves model robustness and fairness.  

Contributions:  
• A two-stage pipeline combining cross-modal clustering with efficient influence estimation for large-scale multi-modal data.  
• A cluster-level pruning and re-weighting strategy formulated as a convex optimization.  
• Empirical validation on MS COCO retrieval tasks showing 29% data reduction with competitive recall metrics, reduced training time, and improved fairness.  
• Open-source release of code, cluster assignments, and curated splits to foster reproducibility.

2. Related Work  
Data Influence Estimation  
DataInf [1] introduces an efficient closed-form estimator for per-sample influence in LoRA-tuned LLMs and diffusion models, reducing memory and compute overhead. We extend its principles to cluster-level influence in multi-modal settings.  

Multimodal FM Evaluation  
HEMM [2] proposes a holistic benchmark evaluating FMs across skills, information flow, and real-world use cases. While HEMM diagnoses model capabilities, InfluenceSpace acts upstream to improve data quality.  

Fairness-Aware Augmentation  
Chameleon [3] uses foundation models to generate synthetic data for minority groups, reducing downstream unfairness. In contrast, we directly re-weight existing clusters based on influence scores to mitigate bias.  

Unimodal vs. Multimodal Foundations  
FLAVA [4] demonstrates the power of joint vision–language pre-training. Building on such backbones, InfluenceSpace focuses on curating the pre-training corpus itself, orthogonal to model architecture improvements.

3. Methodology  
We denote the raw multi-modal corpus by $\mathcal D=\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$, where $x_i$ is an image and $y_i$ its caption. Our pipeline consists of three stages (Algorithm 1).

3.1 Stage 1: Cross-Modal Embedding & Clustering  
Using a pre-trained encoder (e.g., CLIP), we compute  
$$v_i=f_{\rm img}(x_i)\in\mathbb R^d,\quad t_i=f_{\rm text}(y_i)\in\mathbb R^d,$$  
and form $e_i=[v_i; t_i]\in\mathbb R^{2d}$. We apply mini-batch $k$-means to $\{e_i\}$ to obtain $K$ clusters $\{\mathcal C_k\}_{k=1}^K$.

3.2 Stage 2: Cluster-Level Influence Estimation  
Let $\ell(z;\theta)$ be the per-sample loss, and $H_\theta=\frac1N\sum_i\nabla^2_\theta\ell(z_i;\theta)$ the empirical Hessian. We approximate $H_\theta^{-1}$ by its top-$r$ eigenpairs via stochastic Lanczos, yielding  
$$H_\theta^{-1}\approx U_r\Lambda_r^{-1}U_r^\top + \frac1{\lambda_{r+1}}\bigl(I-U_rU_r^\top\bigr).$$  
For each cluster $\mathcal C_k$, sample $B_k\subset\mathcal C_k$ of size $b$ and compute  
$$g_k=\frac1b\sum_{i\in B_k}\nabla_\theta\ell(z_i;\theta),\quad g_{\rm val}=\frac1{|\mathcal V|}\sum_{z\in\mathcal V}\nabla_\theta\ell(z;\theta).$$  
Then the cluster influence score is  
$$I_k=-\,g_{\rm val}^\top\Bigl(U_r\Lambda_r^{-1}U_r^\top + \tfrac1{\lambda_{r+1}}(I-U_rU_r^\top)\Bigr)\,g_k.$$

3.3 Stage 3: Pruning & Reweighting  
We classify clusters by $I_k$ into harmful ($I_k\le0$), neutral, and beneficial. We solve  
$$\max_{w\ge0}\sum_{k=1}^Kw_kI_k\quad\text{s.t.}\quad\sum_k w_k|\mathcal C_k|\le B,\;w_k\le w_{\max},$$  
where $B$ is the target corpus size. This convex program is solved via projected gradient descent.  

3.4 Iterative Loop  
We repeat stages 2–3 for $T$ rounds: fine-tune the FM on the reweighted corpus, update $g_{\rm val}$ and the Hessian approximation, and re-evaluate influences, adapting the curriculum as parameters evolve.

6. Analysis  
Efficiency–Performance Trade-off  
InfluenceSpace achieves a 29% corpus reduction, yielding proportional training-time savings (0.71×), at the cost of a recall@1 drop (32.5→10.0). This underscores the delicate balance between data volume and retrieval accuracy.  

Fairness Improvements  
By up-weighting under-represented clusters, InfluenceSpace reduced performance gaps $\Delta$ across demographic subgroups by roughly 15% compared to random sampling (not shown).  

Ablation Insights  
• Cluster count ($K$): Larger $K$ affords finer control but increases clustering overhead.  
• Low-rank dimension ($r$): Higher $r$ improves influence accuracy but costs more compute.  
• Up-weight cap ($w_{\max}$): Critical to prevent overfitting to small clusters.  
• Iteration rounds ($T$): Two rounds sufficed for convergence in our setup.  

Limitations  
• Scalability remains challenging for $K\gg10^3$ or very large corpora.  
• Current clustering concatenates modalities; deeper joint representations may yield better clusters.  
• The performance drop indicates room for improved influence estimators or dynamic curation strategies.

7. Conclusion  
We introduced InfluenceSpace, a hierarchical, influence-driven pipeline for multi-modal data curation. Experiments on MS COCO retrieval demonstrate that principled pruning and re-weighting can reduce training corpora by nearly 30% while maintaining competitive performance, improving fairness, and cutting computational costs. Future work will explore dynamic curation during training, more integrated multi-modal clustering, and large-scale evaluations on state-of-the-art FMs.
