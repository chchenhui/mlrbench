# Dynamic Sparse Retrieval-Augmented Sub-Quadratic Models for Efficient Long Context Adaptation

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks. However, these models face significant challenges when processing long contextual information while maintaining inference efficiency. Traditional transformer-based models suffer from quadratic complexity in attention mechanisms as sequence length increases, making them computationally expensive and memory-intensive for long-context applications. This limitation is particularly problematic in real-time scenarios requiring adaptation to evolving contexts, such as news analysis, legal document processing, or scientific literature review.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance model performance by incorporating relevant external knowledge. However, current RAG implementations typically append retrieved data directly to the input, exacerbating the quadratic complexity problem and increasing computational overhead. As noted by Xu et al. (2023), while RAG improves model relevance and factuality, it comes at the cost of inflated context windows and processing requirements.

Recent research, such as AttentionRAG (Fang et al., 2025) and Grouped Cross Attention (Hu et al., 2024), has begun exploring more efficient ways to integrate retrieved information. Concurrently, KV cache compression techniques like RazorAttention (Tang et al., 2024) and PyramidKV (Cai et al., 2024) address memory constraints during inference. However, these approaches often tackle either the retrieval efficiency or the memory footprint separately, without a unified framework for end-to-end optimization.

### Research Objectives

This research proposes to develop a novel sub-quadratic architecture that integrates dynamic sparse retrieval with compressive KV caching to enable efficient long-context adaptation. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Design a reinforcement learning-trained retriever module that selectively fetches only the most relevant context tokens for a given query, minimizing redundant prefill operations.

2. Develop a sparse attention mechanism that processes only the retrieved tokens, reducing the computational complexity from quadratic to sub-quadratic.

3. Implement a rotating compressive KV cache that compresses historical context into fixed-size latent states using low-rank projections, preventing unbounded memory growth during extended sequences.

4. Formulate an end-to-end training framework that co-optimizes the retriever and attention mechanisms using a hybrid loss function balancing task accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Significance

The significance of this research lies in its potential to overcome the fundamental limitations of current foundation models in processing long contextual information. By developing a unified framework that addresses both computational complexity and memory constraints, we can enable models to handle extended contexts efficiently without sacrificing performance.

This work directly addresses the growing demand for models that can dynamically adapt to streaming data, such as real-time news analysis, continuous customer support, or monitoring of social media trends. The proposed approach would maintain constant memory usage and sub-quadratic compute requirements even as context length increases, significantly improving throughput for long-context tasks.

Moreover, by creating a balanced tradeoff between retrieval precision and computational efficiency, our approach could make foundation models more accessible in resource-constrained environments, expanding their applicability across diverse domains and deployment scenarios.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 System Architecture Overview

Our proposed system consists of four key components that work together to enable efficient long-context processing:

1. **Dynamic Sparse Retriever (DSR)**: A lightweight module that selects the most relevant tokens from a context window based on the current query.

2. **Sub-Quadratic Sparse Attention (SQA)**: An attention mechanism that operates only on retrieved tokens, reducing computational complexity.

3. **Rotating Compressive KV Cache (RCKV)**: A memory-efficient mechanism that maintains fixed-size latent representations of historical context.

4. **Hybrid Optimization Framework (HOF)**: An end-to-end training approach that jointly optimizes the above components.

Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of our proposed system:

```

### 2.2 Dynamic Sparse Retriever (DSR)

The Dynamic Sparse Retriever is designed to identify and select only the most relevant tokens from the context window, significantly reducing the computational load for subsequent processing.

#### 2.2.1 Retriever Architecture

The DSR consists of a bi-encoder architecture that computes relevance scores between the query and context tokens:

$$\text{score}(q, c_i) = \frac{E_q(q) \cdot E_c(c_i)}{\|E_q(q)\| \cdot \|E_c(c_i)\|}$$

where $E_q$ and $E_c$ are lightweight encoders for the query and context respectively, and $c_i$ represents the $i$-th context token.

To minimize computational overhead, we implement $E_q$ and $E_c$ as reduced-dimension projections of the base model's embeddings:

$$E_q(q) = W_q \cdot \text{Embed}(q)$$
$$E_c(c_i) = W_c \cdot \text{Embed}(c_i)$$

where $W_q, W_c \in \mathbb{R}^{d_r \times d_m}$ are projection matrices mapping from the model embedding dimension $d_m$ to a reduced dimension $d_r$ (where $d_r \ll d_m$).

#### 2.2.2 Token Selection Strategy

Rather than using a fixed threshold for token selection, we employ a dynamic budget approach that adapts to query complexity:

$$\text{budget}(q) = \text{base\_budget} \cdot (1 + \alpha \cdot \text{complexity}(q))$$

where $\text{complexity}(q)$ is estimated by a lightweight query analyzer, and $\alpha$ is a tunable parameter controlling adaptation sensitivity.

The token selection process then becomes:

$$\text{Selected}(q, C) = \text{TopK}(\{\text{score}(q, c_i) | c_i \in C\}, \text{budget}(q))$$

where $C$ is the full context window and $\text{TopK}$ selects the top-K tokens based on relevance scores.

#### 2.2.3 Reinforcement Learning Optimization

To optimize the retriever without direct supervision signals, we employ a reinforcement learning approach. The retriever policy $\pi_\theta$ is trained to maximize expected reward:

$$J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{c_i \sim \pi_\theta(c|q)}[R(q, c_i)]$$

The reward function balances task performance with computational efficiency:

$$R(q, c_i) = \lambda_1 \cdot \text{TaskScore}(q, c_i) - \lambda_2 \cdot \text{TokenCount}(c_i)$$

where $\text{TaskScore}$ evaluates downstream task performance, $\text{TokenCount}$ penalizes excessive token selection, and $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ are balancing hyperparameters.

We optimize this objective using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with an entropy bonus to encourage exploration:

$$L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t[\min(r_t(\theta)\hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)\hat{A}_t)] + \beta S[\pi_\theta](s_t)$$

where $r_t(\theta)$ is the probability ratio, $\hat{A}_t$ is the advantage estimate, $\epsilon$ is the clipping parameter, and $S[\pi_\theta]$ is the entropy bonus with coefficient $\beta$.

### 2.3 Sub-Quadratic Sparse Attention (SQA)

The SQA component processes only the tokens selected by the DSR, dramatically reducing the computational complexity compared to standard attention mechanisms.

#### 2.3.1 Sparse Attention Formulation

Traditional attention computes similarity scores between all query and key pairs, resulting in quadratic complexity. Our sparse attention formulation operates only on the subset of tokens selected by the DSR:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

where $Q, K, V$ are derived only from the selected tokens, resulting in matrices of dimensions $\mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k}$ where $n \ll N$ (the original sequence length).

#### 2.3.2 Cluster-Based Attention Sparsification

To further reduce complexity, we implement cluster-based attention sparsification:

1. Cluster the key-value pairs into $m$ clusters using a lightweight clustering algorithm:

$$C = \{\text{cluster}_1, \text{cluster}_2, ..., \text{cluster}_m\}$$

2. For each query token, compute attention only with cluster centroids:

$$\text{scores}_i = Q_i \cdot [c_1, c_2, ..., c_m]^T$$

3. Select top-k clusters based on these scores and compute full attention only within those clusters:

$$\text{Attention}_{\text{sparse}}(Q_i) = \sum_{j \in \text{TopK}(\text{scores}_i)} \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_i K_j^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V_j$$

This approach reduces complexity from $O(n^2)$ to approximately $O(n \log n)$.

### 2.4 Rotating Compressive KV Cache (RCKV)

The RCKV component addresses the memory constraints in processing long contexts by maintaining a fixed-size representation of historical information.

#### 2.4.1 Low-Rank Projection

We compress the KV cache using low-rank projections that capture the essential information while reducing dimensionality:

$$K_{\text{compressed}} = P_k K_{\text{full}}$$
$$V_{\text{compressed}} = P_v V_{\text{full}}$$

where $P_k, P_v \in \mathbb{R}^{d_c \times d_k}$ are projection matrices, and $d_c < d_k$ is the compressed dimension.

#### 2.4.2 Rotating Buffer Mechanism

To maintain a fixed memory footprint, we implement a rotating buffer mechanism:

1. Maintain a fixed-size buffer $B$ of size $L$ for compressed KV pairs.
2. When new tokens arrive, update the buffer using importance-weighted rotation:

$$w_i = \text{Importance}(kv_i)$$
$$p_i = \frac{\exp(w_i)}{\sum_j \exp(w_j)}$$

3. Probabilistically replace buffer elements based on these weights:

$$B_{\text{new}} = \text{Replace}(B_{\text{old}}, KV_{\text{new}}, p)$$

The importance function estimates the information value of each KV pair using metrics such as attention entropy and frequency of retrieval.

#### 2.4.3 Reconstruction Process

During inference, we reconstruct the full representations when needed:

$$K_{\text{reconstructed}} = P_k^+ K_{\text{compressed}}$$
$$V_{\text{reconstructed}} = P_v^+ V_{\text{compressed}}$$

where $P_k^+, P_v^+$ are pseudo-inverse matrices of the projection matrices.

To minimize reconstruction error, we employ an orthogonal initialization for projection matrices and fine-tune them during training to preserve the most relevant dimensions.

### 2.5 Hybrid Optimization Framework (HOF)

The HOF component ensures that all system elements are optimized together to balance performance and efficiency.

#### 2.5.1 Multi-Objective Loss Function

We define a hybrid loss function that balances several objectives:

$$L_{\text{total}} = \lambda_1 L_{\text{task}} + \lambda_2 L_{\text{retrieval}} + \lambda_3 L_{\text{compression}} + \lambda_4 L_{\text{compute}}$$

where:
- $L_{\text{task}}$ is the primary task loss (e.g., next token prediction for language models)
- $L_{\text{retrieval}}$ measures the quality of token selection by the DSR
- $L_{\text{compression}}$ quantifies the information loss in the RCKV
- $L_{\text{compute}}$ penalizes computational complexity

Each loss component is defined as follows:

$$L_{\text{task}} = \text{CrossEntropy}(y_{\text{pred}}, y_{\text{true}})$$

$$L_{\text{retrieval}} = -\frac{1}{|S|}\sum_{i \in S} \log p(i \in \text{Selected}|q)$$

where $S$ is the set of tokens that most contribute to correct task predictions.

$$L_{\text{compression}} = \|K_{\text{full}} - P_k^+ P_k K_{\text{full}}\|_F^2 + \|V_{\text{full}} - P_v^+ P_v V_{\text{full}}\|_F^2$$

$$L_{\text{compute}} = \beta_1 |\text{Selected}(q, C)| + \beta_2 \sum_{\text{layer}} |\text{Clusters}_{\text{active}}|$$

#### 2.5.2 Curriculum Learning Strategy

To facilitate stable training, we implement a curriculum learning approach:

1. Initial phase: Train with shorter contexts and relaxed efficiency constraints
2. Intermediate phase: Gradually increase context length and tighten efficiency constraints
3. Final phase: Train with full-length contexts and strict efficiency targets

This progression is controlled by a schedule function:

$$\lambda_i(t) = \lambda_i^{\text{final}} \cdot \min\left(1, \frac{t}{T_{\text{ramp}}}\right)$$

where $t$ is the current training step and $T_{\text{ramp}}$ is the ramp-up period.
