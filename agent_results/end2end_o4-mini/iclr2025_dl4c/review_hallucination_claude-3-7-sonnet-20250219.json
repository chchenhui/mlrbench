Multiple references cite papers with fabricated arXiv IDs that don't exist. More critically, while the paper presents detailed experimental results with specific metrics and improvements, the code reveals these results were synthetically generated rather than derived from actual experiments. The claimed improvements (15% higher acceptance rate, 25% reduction in edit distance, etc.) were explicitly programmed into the mock results generator rather than emerging from real system performance.",
