Title:
Adaptive Code Assistant via Implicit Developer Feedback and Reinforcement Learning

Introduction:
Background  
Deep learning models for code generation—such as CodeT5+, GPT-based code samplers, and specialized transformers—have achieved remarkable gains in tasks like completion, summarization, and repair. However, off-the-shelf code suggestions often lack alignment with individual developers’ coding styles, project conventions, and real-time task contexts. Generic suggestions force developers to edit or reject recommendations, leading to context switches, cognitive load, and lost productivity. Recent work on post-training alignment for code (e.g., FALCON’s meta-RL architecture) and personalization (e.g., user-specific language models) demonstrates that human feedback signals can guide model adaptation. Yet most systems rely on explicit feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down) or manual annotations, which interrupt workflow and scale poorly.

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a fully automated, real-time adaptive code assistant that:  
1. Captures implicit feedback signals—such as edit distance, acceptance/rejection patterns, cursor dwell times, and inline comment modifications—without intrusive prompts.  
2. Represents developer preferences and project context via a dynamic user-profile embedding updated on the fly.  
3. Formulates the code suggestion task as a Markov decision process (MDP) and applies proximal policy optimization (PPO) to post-train a pre-trained transformer model.  
4. Validates the approach in controlled experiments with professional developers and open-source projects, measuring editing overhead, acceptance rates, task completion time, code quality, and subjective satisfaction.

Significance  
By seamlessly integrating reinforcement learning from implicit feedback within the IDE, this work addresses key challenges in deep learning for code:  
• Agentic methods for programming tasks—enabling the model to adapt its “policy” toward successful, context-aware code suggestions.  
• Post-training and alignment for code—leveraging human-in-the-loop signals at scale without explicit labeling.  
• Developer productivity and HCI—reducing friction and cognitive load in human–AI collaboration.  
• Open science and responsible AI—releasing the plugin, code, and anonymized interaction logs under an open license.  
• Benchmarking and evaluation—defining standardized metrics for personalized code assistants.

Methodology:
1. System Overview  
We propose an IDE plugin (“Adaptive Assistant”) that continuously monitors developer interactions and communicates with a back-end RL module. The workflow per suggestion request:  
  a. Capture the local code context $c_t$ (e.g., preceding 100 tokens).  
  b. Retrieve the current user profile embedding $u_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$ summarizing past implicit feedback.  
  c. Query a transformer-based policy network $\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)$ to generate a suggestion $a_t$.  
  d. Present $a_t$ to the developer; collect implicit signals during subsequent edits.  
  e. Compute reward $r_t$ from signals; update $u_{t+1}$ and store transition $(s_t,a_t,r_t,s_{t+1})$ in buffer.  
  f. Periodically fine-tune $\theta$ using PPO on the accumulated transitions.

2. Markov Decision Process Formulation  
State space $S$: each state $s_t=(c_t,u_t)$ combines  
  – Context embedding $c_t$: obtained via the transformer’s encoder for the preceding code window.  
  – Profile embedding $u_t$: a learned vector capturing developer style, initialized to zero and updated via exponentially weighted moving average of past gradients.

Action space $A$: token sequences proposed by the model, truncated to a maximum length $L$.

Reward function $r_t$: a scalar combining normalized implicit signals:  
$$
r_t = \alpha_1 \cdot \mathrm{accept}_t + \alpha_2 \cdot \bigl(1 - \frac{\mathrm{editDist}(a_t,a^*_t)}{L}\bigr) + \alpha_3 \cdot \mathrm{dwellNorm}_t + \alpha_4 \cdot \mathrm{commentChange}_t
$$  
where  
  – $\mathrm{accept}_t\in\{0,1\}$ indicates whether the suggestion was accepted without deletion.  
  – $\mathrm{editDist}(a_t,a^*_t)$ is the Levenshtein distance to the edited final code $a^*_t$, normalized by length $L$.  
  – $\mathrm{dwellNorm}_t$ is the normalized cursor dwell time on the suggestion.  
  – $\mathrm{commentChange}_t$ captures inline comment modifications (higher when developer adds explanatory comments).  
Hyperparameters $\alpha_i$ control trade-offs; tuned via grid search on a validation set.

3. Policy Optimization via PPO  
We fine-tune a pre-trained transformer policy with objective:  
$$
L^{\mathrm{CLIP}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \Bigl[ \min\bigl(r_t(\theta)\,\hat{A}_t,\, \mathrm{clip}(r_t(\theta),1-\epsilon,1+\epsilon)\,\hat{A}_t\bigr)\Bigr]
$$  
where  
  – $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\mathrm{old}}}(a_t|s_t)}$ is the probability ratio.  
  – $\hat{A}_t$ is the advantage estimate via generalized advantage estimation (GAE).  
  – $\epsilon$ is the PPO clipping hyperparameter.  
Algorithmic steps per update epoch:  
  1. Sample mini-batches from the interaction buffer.  
  2. Compute advantages $\hat{A}_t$ and returns $G_t$.  
  3. Update $\theta$ by ascending the clipped surrogate objective.  
  4. Apply value‐function loss and entropy bonus to encourage exploration.

4. Data Collection and User Profile Initialization  
– Bootstrapping: deploy plugin to an initial group of 10 open-source contributors for two weeks to collect bootstrapping data (~50K transitions).  
– User privacy: all logged data is anonymized, encrypted at rest, and participation is opt-in.  
– Profile update rule:  
$$
u_{t+1} = \beta\,u_t + (1-\beta)\,\phi(c_t,a_t,r_t)
$$  
where $\phi(\cdot)$ projects the triple into $\mathbb{R}^d$.

5. Experimental Design  
Participants & Tasks  
– Recruit 30 professional developers with diverse backgrounds.  
– Each performs 12 coding tasks drawn from real GitHub issues (e.g., implementing API endpoints, refactoring modules) under two conditions: our adaptive assistant vs. baseline (static CodeT5+).  
Within-subject design with counterbalancing; each participant uses both systems on separate tasks.

Evaluation Metrics  
– Suggestion acceptance rate (% of suggestions kept without major edits).  
– Average edit distance per suggestion.  
– Task completion time (seconds).  
– Code correctness (pass rates on unit tests).  
– Code quality: cyclomatic complexity and lint error counts.  
– Subjective satisfaction: post-task Likert surveys on perceived helpfulness, cognitive load (NASA TLX).

Statistical Analysis  
Use paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare conditions. Report effect sizes (Cohen’s d). Perform ANOVA to assess interaction effects between developer experience level and system condition.

Implementation Details  
– Base model: CodeT5+ checkpoint.  
– Training: learning rate $3\mathrm{e}{-5}$, PPO epochs=4, batch size=32.  
– Infrastructure: GPU cluster (NVIDIA A100), latency budget <200 ms per suggestion.  
– Open-source release: plugin code, RL framework, anonymized interaction logs, and model weights under an MIT license.

Expected Outcomes & Impact:
1. Quantitative Gains  
We anticipate that the adaptive assistant will:  
– Increase suggestion acceptance rates by at least 15% over the static baseline.  
– Reduce average edit distances by 20–30%.  
– Shorten task completion times by 10–20%.  
– Maintain or improve code correctness and quality metrics.

2. Qualitative Benefits  
Developers should report:  
– Lower cognitive load and fewer context switches.  
– Greater trust in AI suggestions due to improved alignment with personal style.  
– Enhanced collaboration with the tool as a “pair programmer.”

3. Scientific Contributions  
– A novel formulation of code suggestion as an MDP with implicit feedback rewards.  
– A scalable, privacy-preserving pipeline for real-time reinforcement learning in IDEs.  
– Empirical insights into the trade-offs between adaptability and stability in personalized code assistants.

4. Broader Impact  
This work advances deep learning for code by demonstrating a practical path toward personalized, context-aware AI partners. It aligns with workshop themes—agentic programming methods, post-training alignment, developer productivity and HCI, open science, and benchmarking. By releasing our artifacts openly, we foster reproducibility and pave the way for community-driven extensions (e.g., multi-language support, richer feedback channels). Ultimately, personalized code assistants can democratize expert-level coding support and accelerate software development across domains.
