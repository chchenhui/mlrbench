A script named `generate_mock_results.py` was found in the codebase, which uses hardcoded statistical distributions and improvement multipliers to generate the exact mean values and improvement percentages reported in the paper. For instance, the baseline acceptance rate is generated from a beta distribution with a mean of ~0.417, and the adaptive rate is calculated by multiplying the baseline by 1.15, fabricating the 15% improvement.",
            "evidence": "From `generate_mock_results.py`:\n```python\n# 15% improvement in acceptance rate\nadaptive_acceptance_rates = baseline_acceptance_rates * 1.15\n\n# 25% improvement in edit distance\nadaptive_edit_distances = baseline_edit_distances * 1.25\n\n# 15% improvement (reduction) in task completion times\nadaptive_times.append(time * 0.85 * random.uniform(0.85, 1.15))\n\n# 10% improvement in code quality\nadaptive_quality.append(quality * 1.1 * random.uniform(0.9, 1.1))\n```\nThis directly corresponds to the values in Table 1 of the paper, such as 'Acceptance Rate' showing a '+15.0 %' improvement and 'Edit Distance' showing a '+25.0 %' improvement."

However, the implementation in `models/adaptive.py` uses a vastly simplified and incorrect version of PPO. It replaces the GAE advantage estimate (`\\hat{A}_t`) with a simple reward-minus-value calculation (`advantages = rewards - old_values.detach()`), which is not GAE. Furthermore, the policy ratio is calculated incorrectly based only on the last token of the input, not the generated action sequence, which is fundamentally incorrect for a sequence generation task.",

The adaptive model's score (0.752) is presented as a 25% improvement over the baseline (0.601). The value 0.752 is almost exactly 1.25 times 0.601, which reveals the result was fabricated by simple multiplication rather than being an aggregated metric from experimental trials. It is statistically impossible for an averaged normalized Levenshtein distance across a dataset to scale by a precise multiplicative factor.",

The experimental results are demonstrably fabricated, as evidenced by a mock data generation script in the codebase that perfectly reproduces the paper's tables.
