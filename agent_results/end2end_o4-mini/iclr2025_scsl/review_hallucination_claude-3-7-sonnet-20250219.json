    "overall_assessment": "The paper contains two significant hallucinations. First, it cites nonexistent papers from the future (2025). Second, it claims to have implemented and evaluated three additional robustification methods (Group-DRO, Adversarial Feature Debiasing, and Contrastive Augmentation) beyond ERM and IRM, but the code and logs show that only ERM and IRM were actually tested. While the code does contain implementations for these additional methods, they were not used in the experiments reported in the paper.",
