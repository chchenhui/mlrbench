The references section lists several papers with fictional authors and invalid arXiv IDs. More critically, the experimental results appear to be completely fabricated, as evidenced by the 'run_minimal.py' script that generates mock data rather than running actual experiments. The log file confirms that the real experiment script failed to execute properly, yet the paper presents these mock results as if they were genuine experimental findings.",
