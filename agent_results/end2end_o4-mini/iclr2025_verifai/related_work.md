**2. Key Challenges**

1. **Specification Ambiguity**: Translating natural language requirements into precise formal specifications is inherently challenging due to ambiguities and variations in human language.

2. **Model Limitations**: LLMs may lack the depth of understanding required for complex formal reasoning, leading to potential inaccuracies in generated code or proofs.

3. **Verification Scalability**: Integrating formal verification with LLM-generated code can be computationally intensive, especially for large or complex programs, affecting scalability.

4. **Error Propagation**: Errors in initial specifications or generated code can propagate through the verification process, complicating debugging and refinement cycles.

5. **Tool Integration**: Seamlessly integrating LLMs with existing formal verification tools and workflows poses technical and compatibility challenges.
