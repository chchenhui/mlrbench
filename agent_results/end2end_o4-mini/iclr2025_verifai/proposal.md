Title  
ContractGPT: A Closed-Loop Formal Specification-Guided LLM Code Synthesis Framework  

1. Introduction  
1.1 Background  
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Codex, GPT-4, and PaLM have revolutionized software development by generating code from natural-language prompts at scale. However, because LLMs are trained on large, noisy corpora and operate probabilistically, their outputs often fail to satisfy precise functional requirements—leading to silent bugs, specification drift, and high downstream maintenance costs. In contrast, formal methods (theorem provers, SMT solvers, static analyzers) offer correctness-by-construction guarantees but struggle to scale to complex domains or require expert intervention to write proofs and invariants.  

Recent systems (e.g., VeCoGen, SpecGen, VeriGen) have begun to integrate LLM code generation with formal verification in a one-shot or semi-manual manner, yet they either demand heavyweight specifications (e.g., full ACSL annotations) or do not close the loop when verification fails. There is an urgent need for a scalable, automated pipeline that synergistically combines the adaptability of LLMs with the rigor of formal methods in an iterative “spec–generate–verify–refine” cycle.  

1.2 Research Objectives  
We propose ContractGPT, a closed-loop framework that:  
•  Allows developers to supply lightweight, function-level pre-/post-conditions in a domain-specific language (DSL).  
•  Employs an LLM to generate candidate implementations annotated with inferred assertions.  
•  Uses a static analyzer + SMT solver to formally check whether the candidate meets the DSL specification.  
•  Converts counterexamples into natural-language feedback and appends it to the next prompt.  
•  Iterates until the solver discharges all verification conditions.  

Our objectives are:  
1. Design a minimal DSL for expressing function contracts (pre-/post-conditions) that balances expressiveness and learnability by LLMs.  
2. Develop an end-to-end algorithm (“spec–generate–verify–refine”) that integrates LLM prompting, static analysis, SMT solving, and feedback translation.  
3. Empirically evaluate ContractGPT on algorithmic (sorting, graph algorithms) and systems-level (file I/O, memory management) benchmarks across multiple languages (C, Python, Rust).  
4. Quantify gains in bug-rate reduction, convergence speed, and specification complexity relative to state-of-the-art baselines (LLM-only, VeCoGen, LLM4Code).  

1.3 Significance  
ContractGPT addresses a major gap in trustworthy AI–driven software engineering by providing strong correctness guarantees while retaining LLM flexibility. It has the potential to:  
•  Reduce latent bugs and maintenance overhead by construction.  
•  Lower the barrier to formal specification by adopting a lightweight DSL.  
•  Generalize to low-resource languages where formal ecosystems are immature.  
•  Advance the state of the art in AI verification by demonstrating a scalable, iterative pipeline.  

2. Methodology  
2.1 DSL for Function Contracts  
We define a simple declarative DSL for preconditions and postconditions over scalar values, arrays, and user-defined data types. A contract for function $f: X\to Y$ consists of:  
•  Precondition $\phi_{\text{pre}}(x)$: a quantifier-free formula over input variables $x\in X$.  
•  Postcondition $\phi_{\text{post}}(x,y)$: a quantifier-free formula relating inputs $x$ and output $y\in Y$.  

Syntax (BNF sketch):  
   <Contract> ::= “requires” <BoolExpr> “ensures” <BoolExpr>  
   <BoolExpr> ::= <ArithExpr> (“==”|“<=”|“…”) <ArithExpr> | <BoolExpr> “&&” <BoolExpr> | <BoolExpr> “||” <BoolExpr> | “forall” <VarDecl> “.” <BoolExpr> | “exists” <VarDecl> “.” <BoolExpr>  
   <ArithExpr> ::= <Var> | <Const> | <ArithExpr> “+” <ArithExpr> | <ArithExpr> “*” <ArithExpr> | “sum(” <Var> “,” <Range> “)”  

Example (sorting):  
   requires length(a) == n && n >= 0  
   ensures forall i,j. 0 <= i < j < n ⇒ a[i] <= a[j]  
   ensures multiset(a_out) == multiset(a_in)  

2.2 Closed-Loop Synthesis Algorithm  
We formalize the iterative pipeline in Algorithm 1.  

Algorithm 1: ContractGPT(specification $S$, max_iters $N$)  
Input: DSL specification $S = (\phi_{\text{pre}},\phi_{\text{post}})$, LLM model $M$, static analyzer + SMT solver $\mathcal{V}$, maximum iterations $N$.  
Output: Verified implementation $c^*$ or failure.  

1. for $t=1$ to $N$ do  
2.   Prompt $M$ with: “Given specification $S$, generate a candidate implementation in [target language] with inline assertions reflecting $\phi_{\text{pre}}$, $\phi_{\text{post}}$.”  
3.   Receive candidate code $c_t$ from $M$.  
4.   Run static analyzer to extract verification conditions $\{VC_i\}$ from $c_t$ and map them to SMT queries.  
5.   for each $VC_i$ do  
6.     $\text{res}_i,\;cex_i \leftarrow \mathcal{V}(VC_i)$  // $\text{res}_i\in\{\textsf{VALID},\textsf{INVALID}\}$  
7.     if $\text{res}_i = \textsf{INVALID}$ then collect counterexample $cex_i$.  
8.   if all $\text{res}_i=\textsf{VALID}$ then return $c_t$ as $c^*$.  
9.   else  
10.     Aggregate $\{cex_i\}$ into natural-language feedback $F_t$.  
11.     Augment prompt with “Counterexamples: $F_t$; please refine your implementation.”  
12. return FAIL // exceeded $N$ without verification  

2.3 Specification Verification  
Each verification condition has the form:  
   $$VC: \quad \forall x.\;\phi_{\text{pre}}(x)\;\Longrightarrow\;\phi_{\text{post}}(x,f(x))\,. $$  
For loop-based code, we generate inductive invariants $I_k$ at loop heads and check:  
   1. $I_k$ holds on entry: $\forall x.\;\phi_{\text{pre}}(x)\implies I_k(x)$.  
   2. $I_k$ preserved: $\forall x,s.\;I_k(x,s)\wedge G(s)\implies I_k(x,s')$.  
   3. Postcondition from invariant: $\forall x,s.\;I_k(x,s)\wedge\lnot G(s)\implies \phi_{\text{post}}(x,\text{result}(s))\,. $

We leverage an off-the-shelf static analyzer (e.g., Frama-C for C, MyPy with contracts for Python) to produce $\{VC_i\}$. The SMT solver (Z3) either discharges each $VC_i$ or returns a model $cex_i$ witnessing a violation.  

2.4 Counterexample-to-Feedback Translation  
We implement a translator $T: \text{Model}\to\text{NL}$ that maps SMT counterexamples (variable assignments) to concise English:  
  “At input x=5, the postcondition a_out sorted fails because a_out[2]=7 but a_out[1]=8.”  
We then append $T(cex_i)$ to the next LLM prompt, guiding it to correct the specific flaw.  

2.5 Experimental Design  
Datasets and Benchmarks:  
•  Algorithmic suite: Sorting (bubble, quicksort), search (binary search), graph (BFS, Dijkstra).  
•  Systems suite: File read/write buffers, memory pool allocators, basic HTTP request parsers.  
•  Languages: C (ANSI C99 + ACSL-style DSL), Python (type-annotated), Rust (contract macros).  

Baselines:  
1. LLM-only: prompt LLM with natural language spec, no verification loop.  
2. VeCoGen: one-shot ACSL + LLM + iterative repair but no NL feedback.  
3. LLM4Code: LLM conditioned on spec, one-shot.  

Metrics:  
•  Success Rate $S = \frac{|$benchmarks verified$|}{|$benchmarks total$|}$.  
•  Mean Iterations $\bar{I} = \frac{1}{|B|}\sum_{b\in B} t_b$, where $t_b$ is the iteration at success.  
•  Bug Rate $\beta = 1 - S_{\text{LLM-only}} / S_{\text{ContractGPT}}$.  
•  Verification Time $T_v$ and Generation Time $T_g$.  
•  Specification Complexity $C_{\text{spec}}$: number of clauses in DSL spec.  
•  Human Effort E: Number of (manual) spec changes made after initial DSL. (We expect E≈0.)  

Procedure:  
1. For each benchmark $b$, author a minimal DSL spec $S_b$.  
2. Run each method with budget $N=5$ iterations and record $S, \bar{I}, T_v, T_g$.  
3. Perform statistical analysis (paired t-tests) across methods on $S$ and $\bar{I}$.  
4. Conduct a small user study (10 developers) to gauge learnability of the DSL and satisfaction.  

2.6 Theoretical Analysis  
We quantify worst-case iteration bound: if each iteration eliminates at least one unique counterexample type, then  
   $$N_{\max} \le \sum_{i=1}^{|B|} |\mathsf{CE}_i|\,, $$  
where $\mathsf{CE}_i$ is the finite set of distinct counterexample categories per benchmark. While this bound is large, in practice LLM generalization reduces $t_b\ll N_{\max}$.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
We anticipate that ContractGPT will:  
1. Achieve a verification success rate $S\ge 90\%$ on algorithmic benchmarks, outperforming LLM-only ($S\approx60\%$) and VeCoGen ($S\approx75\%$).  
2. Converge in $\bar{I}\le 3$ iterations on average, demonstrating efficient feedback integration.  
3. Reduce bug rates $\beta$ by $>50\%$ compared to baselines.  
4. Scale across languages (C, Python, Rust) with minimal DSL overhead (avg.\ spec length $C_{\text{spec}}\le 10$ clauses).  
5. Show negligible manual effort $E\approx0$ in spec maintenance across iterations.  
6. Yield positive developer feedback on DSL learnability (≥80\% rated “easy” or “moderate” to use).  

Impact  
ContractGPT will:  
•  Provide a practical, generalizable pipeline for embedding formal guarantees into AI-driven code synthesis.  
•  Lower barriers to adoption of formal methods by offering a lightweight, iterative interface.  
•  Enable safer code generation for critical domains (embedded systems, finance, healthcare).  
•  Stimulate further research on probabilistic verification loops and human–AI collaboration in formal analysis.  

By releasing our DSL, dataset of benchmarks + specs, and open-source implementation of ContractGPT, we aim to catalyze a community around AI-assisted formal software engineering, fulfilling the VerifAI vision of “AI Verification in the Wild.”
