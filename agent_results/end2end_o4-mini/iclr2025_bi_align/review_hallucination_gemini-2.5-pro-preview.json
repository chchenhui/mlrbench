The implementation in the code avoids this error by using a different formulation, but this makes the paper's mathematical description incorrect and misleading.",

The citations are nonexistent, the core methodology and mathematical framework described in the paper are both logically flawed and inconsistent with the provided source code, and the quantitative results presented in the tables are clearly fabricated, as they contradict the data visualized in the plots. The paper is fundamentally unreliable and does not accurately represent the accompanying code or a valid scientific experiment.",
