It cites nonexistent academic papers, presents experimental results that go beyond what was actually implemented in the code, and describes a comprehensive framework with features that weren't fully implemented or tested in the provided code. While the basic concept and some code structure exists, the paper presents a much more developed system than what is actually demonstrated in the code.",
