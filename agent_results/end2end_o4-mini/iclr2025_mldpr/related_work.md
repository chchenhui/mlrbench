   - **Authors**: Yanli Li, Jehad Ibrahim, Huaming Chen, Dong Yuan, Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces Holistic Evaluation Metrics (HEM) for federated learning, emphasizing the need for comprehensive evaluation beyond single metrics like accuracy. HEM considers various aspects such as accuracy, convergence, computational efficiency, fairness, and personalization, tailored to specific use cases like IoT, smart devices, and institutions.

   - **Authors**: Christopher Fifty, Dennis Duan, Ronald G. Junkins, Ehsan Amid, Jure Leskovec, Christopher Re, Sebastian Thrun
   - **Summary**: This work proposes a meta-learning algorithm that enables visual models to learn new concepts during inference without fine-tuning, akin to the capabilities of large language models. By leveraging a frozen pre-trained feature extractor and recasting visual meta-learning as sequence modeling over labeled and unlabeled data points, the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple meta-learning benchmarks without prior meta-training or fine-tuning.

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Overemphasis on Single Metrics**: Traditional benchmarking often focuses on singular performance metrics like accuracy, neglecting other critical factors such as fairness, robustness, and environmental impact. This narrow focus can lead to models that excel in specific tasks but fail to generalize or perform ethically in real-world applications.

2. **Lack of Contextual Awareness**: Current evaluation frameworks frequently overlook the context in which models operate, including domain-specific requirements, data provenance, and ethical considerations. This absence of context-aware evaluation can result in models that are ill-suited for particular applications or that inadvertently perpetuate biases.

3. **Dataset Overuse and Benchmark Gaming**: The repeated use of a limited set of benchmark datasets can lead to models that are overfitted to these specific datasets, reducing their generalizability. Additionally, this practice can encourage benchmark gaming, where models are optimized to perform well on benchmarks rather than addressing real-world challenges.

4. **Insufficient Evaluation of Model Trade-offs**: Many existing benchmarks fail to assess the trade-offs between different performance dimensions, such as accuracy versus computational efficiency or fairness versus robustness. Without a holistic evaluation, it is challenging to understand the strengths and weaknesses of models comprehensively.

5. **Dynamic Task Configurations**: Adapting evaluation criteria and test splits based on user-specified deployment contexts is complex and often unsupported in current benchmarking frameworks. This limitation hinders the ability to assess model performance in diverse and evolving real-world scenarios.
