Title: ContextBench – A Holistic, Context-Aware Benchmarking Framework

Motivation:  
Standard ML benchmarks focus narrowly on single metrics (e.g., accuracy) and overuse a few datasets, leading to models that overfit tasks without understanding real‐world trade-offs. There is a critical need for a benchmarking paradigm that embeds context—domain, data provenance, ethical considerations, and multi-dimensional metrics—to drive robust, fair, and practically useful model development.

Main Idea:  
ContextBench integrates three components:  
1. Contextual Metadata Schema – A standardized ontology capturing dataset provenance, collection methods, demographic distributions, licensing, and deprecation status.  
2. Multi-Metric Evaluation Suite – Beyond performance, it measures fairness (e.g., subgroup parity), robustness (adversarial/shift resilience), environmental impact (compute/energy), and interpretability (feature attribution stability).  
3. Dynamic Task Configurations – Workflows that adapt test splits and evaluation criteria based on user-specified deployment contexts (e.g., healthcare vs. finance).  

Researchers submit models via API to receive a “Context Profile” report highlighting strengths and weaknesses across dimensions. Public leaderboards are partitioned by context, discouraging overfitting to a single task. Expected outcomes include richer insights into model trade-offs, reduced benchmark gaming, and a cultural shift toward responsible, context-aware ML development.
