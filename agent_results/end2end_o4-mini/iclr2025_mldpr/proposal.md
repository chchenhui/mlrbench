1. Title  
ContextBench: A Holistic, Context-Aware Benchmarking Framework for Responsible Machine Learning  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Machine learning research and practice have historically relied on a small set of benchmark datasets and single‐number metrics (e.g. accuracy, F1) to compare methods. While these benchmarks have driven rapid progress, they have also led to several problems: overfitting to popular datasets, benchmark gaming, neglect of ethical and domain-specific requirements, and insufficient evaluation of trade-offs such as fairness versus efficiency or robustness versus interpretability. Recent works—HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) [3], HEM (Holistic Evaluation Metrics for Federated Learning) [1], GAIA [10]—demonstrate the value of multi-dimensional evaluation, but they focus on specific domains (e.g., NLP) or settings (e.g., federated learning). There remains no unifying framework that (a) captures rich contextual metadata, (b) evaluates models across a balanced suite of metrics, and (c) dynamically tailors evaluation to user-specified deployment contexts.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to design, implement, and validate ContextBench, a novel, open-source, context-aware benchmarking framework that:  
• Defines a standardized metadata ontology for dataset provenance, demographics, licensing, and deprecation status.  
• Supplies a multi-metric evaluation suite covering performance, fairness, robustness, environmental impact, and interpretability.  
• Supports dynamic task configurations driven by user-provided deployment context (e.g. healthcare, finance, vision).  
• Provides an API and context-partitioned leaderboards to discourage overfitting to a single metric or dataset.  

Significance  
By integrating metadata, metrics, and contextual workflows, ContextBench will shift the community toward more responsible and practically relevant model development. It will reduce dataset overuse, foster transparent citations, and surface trade-offs that single metrics obscure. The framework is designed for extensibility—new contexts, metrics, and datasets can be added by repository administrators (e.g. OpenML, HuggingFace Datasets) or researchers.  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Overview  
ContextBench consists of three core modules:  
  A. Contextual Metadata Schema (CMS)  
  B. Multi-Metric Evaluation Suite (MES)  
  C. Dynamic Task Configuration Engine (DTCE)  
Researchers submit model artifacts via a REST API; the system automatically retrieves both data and metadata, runs the MES under the user’s chosen context, and returns a “Context Profile” report.  

3.2 Contextual Metadata Schema  
We adopt an RDF-inspired data model: each dataset \(D\) is associated with a metadata record \(M(D)\). Let  
  • \(P = \{p_1,\dots,p_k\}\) be metadata predicates (e.g. provenance, demographics).  
  • \(O = \{o_1,\dots,o_m\}\) be objects (e.g. “United States,” “2021”).  
We define a triple store \(T = \{(D,p,o)\}\). For example:  
  (ImageNet, hasProvenance, “ILSVRC 2012”),  
  (MIMIC-III, hasDemographicInfo, “Critical Care Patients, Age 16+”).  

Metadata Ontology  
  • DatasetID: unique identifier  
  • Provenance: source, collection date  
  • Demographics: distributions over sensitive attributes \(A\) (e.g. age, gender)  
  • Licensing: license type (e.g. CC-BY-SA)  
  • DeprecationStatus: boolean + rationale  
  • DomainTags: ontology terms (e.g. “healthcare,” “finance”)  

We provide a JSON-LD serialization and a validation schema (JSON-Schema) to ensure uniformity.  

3.3 Multi-Metric Evaluation Suite  
Let \(\mathcal{M} = \{M_1,\dots,M_q\}\) be the metric set, where  
  \(M_1\) = Accuracy (or domain-appropriate performance)  
  \(M_2\) = Fairness (e.g. demographic parity difference)  
  \(M_3\) = Robustness (adversarial and shift resilience)  
  \(M_4\) = Environmental Impact (energy \(E\) measured in kWh)  
  \(M_5\) = Interpretability (attribution stability)  

3.3.1 Fairness  
We adopt subgroup parity: for classification label set \(\mathcal{Y}\) and sensitive groups \(G = \{g_1,\dots,g_r\}\),  
  
  $$ \Delta_{\text{fair}} = \max_{i,j} \bigl|\Pr(\hat Y = y \mid G=g_i) - \Pr(\hat Y = y \mid G=g_j)\bigr|, $$  

averaged over \(y\in\mathcal{Y}\).  

3.3.2 Robustness  
We evaluate \(\ell_{\infty}\) adversarial accuracy and natural shift resilience. For an adversary with budget \(\epsilon\), we measure:  
  
  $$ \text{AdvAcc}(\epsilon) = \Pr\bigl(\hat Y(x+\delta)=Y(x)\bigr),\ \|\delta\|_\infty \le \epsilon. $$  

For domain shift (e.g. train/test from different hospitals), we compute relative drop:  
  
  $$ \text{ShiftDrop} = 1 - \frac{\text{Acc}_{\text{shifted}}}{\text{Acc}_{\text{orig}}}. $$  

3.3.3 Environmental Impact  
We log GPU time \(t\) and energy \(E = P\times t\) (where \(P\) is average power draw) and report  
  $$ E_{\text{norm}} = \frac{E}{\text{num\_samples}}. $$  

3.3.4 Interpretability  
Using SHAP [Lundberg & Lee ’17], we compute attribution vectors \(a_i\) for sample \(i\). We define stability as  
  $$ \text{Stability} = 1 - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\|a_i - a_i'\|_1}{\|a_i\|_1}, $$  
where \(a_i'\) is computed on a perturbed input.  

3.4 Dynamic Task Configuration Engine  
Each context \(C\) is specified by a tuple \((D,\omega)\), where \(D\) is the dataset and \(\omega\) is a context vector containing domain constraints (e.g. “max false positive rate ≤ 5%,” regulatory constraints). DTCE transforms the original test set \(T\) into a context-specific split \(T_C\).  

Algorithm 1: Contextual Test Split  
Input: dataset \(D\), metadata \(M(D)\), context \(\omega\)  
Output: test split \(T_C\)  
1. Parse \(\omega\) to extract constraints (subgroup weights \(\alpha_i\), performance thresholds)  
2. Reweight instances in \(T\): for each \(x_j\in T\), assign weight \(w_j = f(M(D),\omega)\)  
3. Sample \(T_C\) of size \(|T|\) with probability \(\propto w_j\)  
4. Return \(T_C\)  

This allows users in healthcare to emphasize rare diseases, or finance teams to penalize FPR more heavily.  

3.5 Implementation & API  
We implement ContextBench as a microservice architecture:  
  • Metadata Registry: MongoDB storing \(T\).  
  • Evaluation Engine: Dockerized scripts for each metric.  
  • DTCE: Python module using pandas and scikit-learn.  
  • REST API: endpoints for dataset registration, model submission, context specification, and result retrieval.  

3.6 Experimental Design  
Datasets & Contexts  
  • Healthcare: MIMIC-III (risk prediction)  
  • Finance: LendingClub (default prediction)  
  • Vision: ImageNet (classification)  
  • NLP: GLUE tasks (e.g. MNLI, QQP)  

Baselines  
  • Standard leaderboard (accuracy / F1)  
  • HELM framework [3] for language tasks  
  • GAIA for AI assistants [10]  

Experiments  
  1. Model Suite: ResNet-50, EfficientNet, BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2 finetuned.  
  2. Evaluate each model under three contexts per domain.  
  3. Record metric vector \(\mathbf{m}=(M_1,\dots,M_5)\).  
  4. Compute Spearman correlation between single‐metric ranks and multi‐metric ranks.  
  5. Conduct ablation: remove CMS or DTCE or MES components to quantify their contribution.  

Evaluation Metrics  
  • Kendall’s τ between standard leaderboard and ContextBench ranking.  
  • Reduction in benchmark overfitting: measure performance drop on unseen contexts.  
  • User study: survey 30 ML practitioners on interpretability of Context Profile vs. standard leaderboard.  

4. Expected Outcomes  
  • Open-source ContextBench platform with full documentation.  
  • Standardized metadata ontology (JSON-LD + JSON-Schema).  
  • Multi-metric evaluation suite integrated into a continuous evaluation pipeline.  
  • Dynamic leaderboards partitioned by context, discouraging overfitting to any one metric or dataset.  
  • Peer‐reviewed publications demonstrating (a) improved transparency, (b) richer insight into trade-offs, and (c) reduced single‐metric gaming.  

5. Impact  
Community Adoption  
ContextBench will be released under an MIT license and promoted through major dataset repositories (OpenML, HuggingFace Datasets, UCI). Early adopters can extend contexts, add new metrics, and contribute new datasets.  

Cultural Shift  
By surfacing contextual metadata and multi-dimensional performance, ContextBench encourages researchers and practitioners to think beyond “winner‐takes‐all” leaderboards. We anticipate wider adoption of dataset deprecation flags, explicit licensing records, and fairness-driven development.  

Long-Term Vision  
We envisage a future ML ecosystem in which every dataset carries rich provenance, every model is evaluated in relevant real-world contexts, and multi-metric trade-offs are the norm. ContextBench is a first step toward that vision, aligning technical progress with ethical and practical requirements.
