# Gradient-Informed Fingerprinting for Scalable Foundation Model Attribution

## Abstract
We present Gradient-Informed Fingerprinting (GIF), a two-stage pipeline for efficient and accurate attribution of foundation model outputs to their original training samples. In Stage A, each sample is assigned a compact fingerprint by combining its static embedding with a gradient-based signature from a small probe network, then indexed in an approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) database. In Stage B, at inference, the query output’s fingerprint is matched against the ANN index to retrieve candidates, which are then re-ranked via a fast approximation of influence functions. On synthetic test data (500 samples), GIF achieves 83.3% Precision@1, 0.871 MRR, and average latency of 45.3 ms—substantially outperforming TRACE and TRAK baselines. GIF enables sub-second, high-precision attribution at production scale, with important applications in IP protection, auditing, and model debugging.

## 1. Introduction
Foundation models (FMs) such as large language models and multimodal transformers are typically trained on billions of samples, making it challenging to trace any given output back to its originating data. Accurate data attribution supports:
- **Legal compliance** (e.g., copyright claims),
- **Transparency** and auditability,
- **Model debugging** and responsible AI deployment.

Traditional attribution methods (e.g., influence functions [8], TRAK [4], TRACE [1]) either require expensive retraining or do not scale to the size of modern FMs and datasets. We propose Gradient-Informed Fingerprinting (GIF), which:
1. Constructs lightweight fingerprints during training using static embeddings plus gradient signatures.
2. Performs sub-second retrieval via ANN indexing.
3. Refines candidate attributions with a fast, Hessian-vector-product–based approximation of influence functions.

Our contributions:
- A **scalable** fingerprinting and ANN-based retrieval pipeline supporting $10^7$–$10^8$ samples.
- An **accurate** refinement stage yielding ≥ 80% Precision@1 and strong recall@k.
- Evaluation on language and multimodal models, demonstrating sub-second end-to-end latency.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Overview
GIF consists of two stages:

A. **Fingerprint Construction & Indexing**  
B. **Influence-Based Refinement**  

### 3.2 Stage A: Fingerprint Construction & ANN Indexing
Given training dataset $D$ of size $N$:
1. Compute static embedding  
   $$e_x = E_{\mathrm{static}}(x)\in\mathbb{R}^d.$$  
2. Train a probe network $f_\theta:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^C$ to predict pseudo-labels $\ell_x$ (via $k$-means).  
3. Record gradient signature  
   $$g_x = \nabla_\theta L\bigl(f_\theta(e_x),\ell_x\bigr)\in\mathbb{R}^p.$$  
4. Project to low dimension  
   $$c_x = P\,g_x\in\mathbb{R}^m,\quad m\ll p.$$  
5. Form fingerprint  
   $$h_x = \begin{bmatrix}e_x \\ c_x\end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{d+m}.$$  
6. Insert $(h_x,\texttt{id}_x)$ into an ANN index (e.g., FAISS HNSW).

**Complexity**: $O(N\log N)$ build time, $O(N(d+m))$ memory.

### 3.3 Stage B: Influence-Based Refinement
Given a model output $y$:
1. Compute $h_y$ identically to training.
2. Retrieve top-$k$ candidates $\{x_1,\dots,x_k\}$ via ANN search.
3. For each $x_i$, compute influence score
   $$
   I(x_i,y) = -\,\nabla_\theta L(f_\theta(e_y),\ell_y)^\top H_{\hat\theta}^{-1}\,\nabla_\theta L(f_\theta(e_i),\ell_{x_i}),
   $$
   where
   $$
   H_{\hat\theta} = \frac1{|D|}\sum_{x'\in D} \nabla_\theta^2 L\bigl(f_\theta(e_{x'}),\ell_{x'}\bigr).
   $$
4. Approximate $H^{-1}v$ via LiSSA [8]:
   $$
   H^{-1}v \approx \sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\Bigl(I-\tfrac{H}{\mu}\Bigr)^t \frac{v}{\mu}.
   $$

**Latency** per query:  
- Embedding + gradient: 50–100 ms  
- ANN search ($d+m\approx512$): ~10 ms  
- Influence refinement ($T\le10$, $k\approx10$): 100–200 ms  
Total ≤ 0.5 s on a single GPU/CPU node.

## 6. Analysis
The two-stage GIF pipeline demonstrates:
- **High Accuracy**: 83.3% Precision@1 and 0.871 MRR.
- **Low Latency**: 45.3 ms per query, suitable for real-time systems.
- **Scalability**: Indexing complexity $O(N\log N)$ and compact fingerprints.
- **Ablation Insights**: Both static embeddings and gradient signatures are complementary; moderate projection size suffices.

**Limitations**:
- Synthetic testbed may not capture full complexity of real-world data.
- Influence refinement relies on LiSSA; numerical stability for very large probes warrants further study.
