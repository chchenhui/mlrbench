1. Title  
Gradient-Informed Fingerprinting for Scalable Foundation Model Attribution  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Foundation models (FMs) such as large language models and multimodal transformers are revolutionizing AI applications across industries. Yet as these models grow in size—often trained on billions of data samples—the ability to trace any particular model output back to its originating training examples becomes increasingly challenging. Accurate data attribution supports legal compliance (e.g., copyright claims), transparency, model debugging, and robust audit trails. Traditional attribution techniques (e.g., influence functions [Fast Approximation of Influence Functions 2023], TRAK [Park et al., 2023], TRACE [Wang et al., 2024]) either require expensive retraining or do not scale to modern FMs and massive datasets.  

Research Objectives  
We propose a two-stage pipeline, called Gradient-Informed Fingerprinting (GIF), that (1) assigns each training sample a compact, searchable fingerprint combining static embeddings and gradient-based signatures, and (2) refines candidate attributions via a fast approximation of influence functions. Our goals are:  
• Scalability: Achieve sub-second attribution queries over datasets of 10⁷–10⁸ samples.  
• Accuracy: Reach ≥ 80% precision@1 and strong recall@k in retrieving true origin samples.  
• Generality: Support both language and multimodal FMs with minimal adaptation.  

Significance  
GIF will enable real-time, fine-grained tracing of FM outputs to training data, empowering intellectual-property protection, regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI Act), and responsible AI deployment. By combining lightweight fingerprinting with principled influence-based refinement, GIF bridges a critical gap between attribution accuracy and query latency in large-scale FMs.  

3. Methodology  
Our pipeline consists of two stages: (A) Fingerprint Construction & Indexing and (B) Influence-Based Refinement. We describe data sources, algorithmic steps with formulas, and experimental design.  

3.1 Data Collection & Preprocessing  
• Datasets: We will pilot on open corpora—The Pile (800 GB text), C4 (750 GB), LAION-400M (CLIP-text pairs)—and emulate a production-scale FM training set by sampling up to 50 million text or image-text examples.  
• Tokenization & Embeddings:  
  – For text: apply a standard tokenizer (e.g., BPE) and embed each sample $x$ via a frozen pretrained encoder $E_{\mathrm{static}}$, yielding $e_x\in\mathbb R^d$.  
  – For multimodal: use CLIP’s image encoder for images and text encoder for captions, then concatenate or project into a shared $d$-dimensional space.  
• Clustering for Pseudo-Labels: Partition the embedding space into $C$ clusters via $k$-means on a random 1 M subsample; assign cluster ID $\ell_x\in\{1\dots C\}$ to each $e_x$. These serve as pseudo-labels for probe training.  

3.2 Stage A: Fingerprint Construction & ANN Indexing  
We train a small probe network $f_\theta:\mathbb R^d\to\mathbb R^C$ (an MLP with two hidden layers of width $h$) to classify $e_x$ into cluster $\ell_x$. During training on the full dataset $D$, we record for each sample $x$:  
  1. Static embedding: $e_x = E_{\mathrm{static}}(x)$.  
  2. Gradient signature:  
     $$g_x = \nabla_\theta \,L\bigl(f_\theta(e_x),\ell_x\bigr)\,\in\mathbb R^p,$$  
     where $L$ is cross-entropy loss and $p=|\theta|$.  
  3. Dimensionality reduction: project $g_x$ via a random matrix $P\in\mathbb R^{m\times p}$ to obtain $c_x = P\,g_x\in\mathbb R^m$ (with $m\ll p$).  
  4. Fingerprint vector:  
     $$h_x = \begin{bmatrix}e_x \\ c_x\end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb R^{d+m}.$$  
  5. Indexing: insert $(h_x,\texttt{id}_x)$ into an approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) index (e.g., FAISS HNSW).  

Complexity & Storage  
– Embedding cost per sample: one forward pass of $E_{\mathrm{static}}$.  
– Gradient cost: one backward pass on $f_\theta$ (negligible compared to FM).  
– Index build: $O(N\log N)$ time, $O(N(d+m))$ memory.  

3.3 Stage B: Influence-Based Refinement  
At inference, given a model output $y$, we:  
  1. Compute $e_y, g_y, c_y, h_y$ identically to training.  
  2. Query the ANN index with $h_y$ to retrieve top-$k$ candidate IDs $\{x_1,\dots,x_k\}$.  
  3. For each candidate $x_i$, compute an influence score  
     $$I(x_i,y)\;=\;-\,\nabla_\theta L(f_\theta(e_y),\ell_y)^\top\;H_{\hat\theta}^{-1}\;\nabla_\theta L(f_\theta(e_i),\ell_{x_i}),$$  
     where  
     $$H_{\hat\theta}=\frac1{|D|}\sum_{x'\in D}\nabla_\theta^2L\bigl(f_\theta(e_{x'}),\ell_{x'}\bigr)$$  
     is the Hessian of the probe’s loss at convergence $\hat\theta$.  
  4. Approximate $H^{-1}v$ via LiSSA [Fast Approximation of Influence Functions, 2023]:  
     $$H^{-1}v\approx\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\Bigl(I-\frac{H}{\mu}\Bigr)^t\frac{v}{\mu},$$  
     with small $T$ and damping $\mu>0$, each term computed by Hessian–vector products.  
  5. Return candidates ranked by $I(x_i,y)$ as final attributions.  

Latency Analysis  
– Fingerprint creation (embed + grad) per query: $\sim$50–100 ms.  
– ANN search (HNSW, $d+m\approx512$): $\sim$10 ms.  
– Influence refinement ($k$ Hessian–vector products, $T\le10$): $\sim$100–200 ms.  
Total per query: $\le$ 0.5 s on a single GPU/CPU node.
