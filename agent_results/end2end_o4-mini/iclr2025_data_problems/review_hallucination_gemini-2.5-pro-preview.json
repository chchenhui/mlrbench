A script named `generate_placeholder_figures.py` was found in the codebase, which contains hardcoded values that perfectly match all the metrics reported in the paper's Table 1 and are used to generate the corresponding figures. This indicates the experiments were not actually performed and the results were invented. Furthermore, the execution logs show that the experiment scripts fail with critical errors, confirming that the code could not have been run to produce the reported results.",

However, the code that corresponds to this experiment (`run_simplified_experiment.py` with `config_simplified.json`) only implements a comparison against the TRACE baseline. The TRAK baseline is not included or executed in this script. Therefore, the reported results for the TRAK method are based on a hallucinated experimental procedure that was never implemented in the provided code for this specific experiment.",

The experimental results are entirely fabricated, as proven by a script that hardcodes the reported numbers and by buggy code that cannot be executed.
