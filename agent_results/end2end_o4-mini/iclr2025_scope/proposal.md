1. Title  
Adaptive Attention‐Guided KV Cache Compression for Long‐Context Sub‐Quadratic Inference  

2. Introduction  
Background  
Foundation models based on the Transformer architecture excel at a wide range of tasks in language, vision and multi-modal settings, but their inference cost grows quadratically with context length due to the maintenance of full key–value (KV) caches. As applications demand longer contexts for tasks such as document understanding, dialogue, and retrieval-augmented generation, the quadratic memory footprint and compute overhead of naïve KV caching become prohibitive. Recent works (e.g., ZACK, DynamicKV, RazorAttention, UNComp) have explored adaptive compression, uncertainty-aware pruning, and head-specific optimization, yet striking the right balance between memory savings, computational efficiency, and performance preservation remains an open challenge.

Research Objectives  
This project aims to develop a novel, on-the-fly KV cache compression scheme that:  
• Leverages the model’s own attention scores to identify and prune low-information tokens.  
• Clusters and summarizes retained KV pairs into a low-rank representation via an online k-means procedure.  
• Fine-tunes the entire system with a distillation objective to align compressed inference with the full-cache baseline.  

The specific objectives are:  
1. Define a token importance scoring mechanism based on multi-head attention weights and cumulative layer contributions.  
2. Design an efficient, single-pass algorithm to prune and cluster KV entries, bounding memory growth to a fixed budget $B$.  
3. Integrate a distillation loss during fine-tuning to minimize degradation in perplexity and downstream task metrics.  
4. Evaluate the proposed method on a suite of long-context benchmarks, comparing against state-of-the-art baselines in terms of speed, memory, and accuracy.  

Significance  
By reducing per-token inference complexity from $O(T^2)$ to near $O(T\log T)$ or linear for long sequences, our approach will:  
• Enable real-time, resource-constrained deployment of foundation models on longer contexts (e.g., $T\ge 16$K tokens).  
• Facilitate integration of retrieval-augmented generation systems with up-to-date knowledge while bounding KV cache sizes.  
• Provide a unified framework adaptable across model sizes, modalities, and downstream tasks.  

3. Methodology  
3.1 Preliminaries  
Given a pre-trained Transformer with $L$ layers and $H$ attention heads per layer, at inference time the model maintains history via KV caches of dimension $(T\times d)$, where $T$ is the current context length and $d$ the head dimension. Naïvely, each new token requires computing attention scores against all past $T$ keys, yielding $O(T^2d)$ compute and $O(Td)$ memory per token.  

3.2 Token Importance Scoring  
We assign each historical token $i$ an importance score $I_i$ by aggregating attention contributions across layers and heads. Let $A^{(l,h)}\in\mathbb{R}^{t\times t}$ be the attention matrix at time $t$ in layer $l$ and head $h$, with entries $A^{(l,h)}_{j,i}$ denoting attention from query position $j$ to key position $i$. We define:  
$$I_i \;=\;\sum_{l=1}^L \sum_{h=1}^H \sum_{j=m}^{t} A^{(l,h)}_{j,i},$$  
where $m=\max(1,t-\Delta+1)$ restricts summation to the last $\Delta$ positions (e.g., $\Delta=256$) to emphasize recent dynamics. This cumulative score reflects how often and how strongly token $i$ is attended to in recent layers.

3.3 Pruning Strategy  
We set a target cache budget $B$ (in number of KV pairs) much smaller than $T$. At each pruning interval (every $P$ new tokens), we:  
1. Compute $\{I_i\}_{i=1}^T$.  
2. Rank tokens by $I_i$ and retain the top $B$ indices $\mathcal{S}$.  
3. Discard all KV pairs for $i\notin\mathcal{S}$.  

This reduces the cache to size $B$ while ensuring that the most informative tokens remain.  

3.4 Low-Rank Summarization via Online Clustering  
To further compress the retained $B$ pairs into a fixed set of $K\ll B$ summaries, we apply an online k-means algorithm in the key space. Let $\{k_i\}_{i\in\mathcal{S}}$ be the set of retained $d$-dimensional key vectors. We maintain $K$ centroids $\{\mu_k\}_{k=1}^K$. Each new key vector $k_i$ is assigned to its nearest centroid $\mu_{c_i}$ and the centroid is updated by:  
$$\mu_{c_i} \leftarrow (1-\eta)\,\mu_{c_i} + \eta\,k_i,$$  
where $\eta$ is a small learning rate. The corresponding value vectors $\{v_i\}$ in each cluster are similarly summarized by maintaining cluster means. At the end of each interval, we replace the $B$ KV pairs with the $K$ centroids and their associated summarized value vectors, yielding a compact, low-rank sketch of past context.  

3.5 Fine-Tuning with Distillation  
To mitigate performance loss from compression, we fine-tune the model parameters $\theta$ on a mixed objective: the standard maximum likelihood loss $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{MLE}}$ plus a distillation loss $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{dist}}$ that aligns the student (compressed) logits with the teacher (full-cache) logits. Given teacher logits $z^{\mathrm{T}}$ and student logits $z^{\mathrm{S}}$ for the next token, we define:  
$$\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{dist}} = \mathrm{KL}\bigl(\mathrm{softmax}(z^{\mathrm{T}}/T)\,\Vert\,\mathrm{softmax}(z^{\mathrm{S}}/T)\bigr)$$  
with temperature $T>1$. The combined loss is  
$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{MLE}} + \lambda\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{dist}}.$$  
Hyperparameter $\lambda$ balances fidelity to the teacher and the generation objective.

3.6 Algorithm Summary  
At inference time, for each incoming token:  
1. Append query to compute attention against current KV cache.  
2. After every $P$ tokens, compute $I_i$ for $i=1,\dots,T$.  
3. Retain top $B$ tokens, prune others.  
4. Update $K$ cluster centroids via online k-means for retained keys and values.  
5. Replace cache with $K$ summarized KV pairs.  
6. Continue decoding with compressed cache.  

This ensures the per-token cost after compression is $O(Bd + Kd)$ rather than $O(Td)$, with $B,K\ll T$.

3.7 Complexity Analysis  
Let $T$ be the original context length, $B$ the retention budget, and $K$ the number of clusters. The worst-case per-step compute is:  
• $O(P\,H\,d\,B)$ to compute scores every $P$ steps.  
• $O(B\log B)$ for ranking tokens.  
• $O(B\,d)$ to update centroids.  
Thus, the average per-token complexity asymptotically approaches $O(B\,d)$, which is effectively linear when $B$ is fixed.

2. Memory reduction of 80–90% for KV caches, enabling inference on constrained hardware (e.g., single A100 with 40 GB).  
3. Minimal performance degradation: <1% increase in perplexity, <1 ROUGE point drop on summarization tasks.  
4. Demonstration of adaptive behavior across diverse tasks, with ablations showing the complementary benefits of attention-guided pruning and clustering.
