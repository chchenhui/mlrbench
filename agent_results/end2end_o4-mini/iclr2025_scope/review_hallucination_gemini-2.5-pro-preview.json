The provided execution log (`log.txt`) shows that the main evaluation script (`evaluate.py`) failed to run due to an error in loading the dataset (`datasets.exceptions.DatasetNotFoundError`). The results, figures, and specific numerical claims in the paper (e.g., 5.31x speedup, 65.75% memory reduction) were not generated from actual experiments on the claimed datasets (PG19, WikiText-103, etc.). Instead, they were produced by a separate script (`simulated_results.py`) that generates artificial data designed to look plausible. The numbers in the paper perfectly match the output of this simulation script, confirming the fabrication.",

All citations are nonexistent, and the entire experimental results section is fabricated, with data generated from a simulation script rather than actual experiments. While the proposed methodology appears sound and is implemented in the provided code, the complete lack of valid experimental evidence renders the paper's performance claims entirely unsupported and misleading.",
