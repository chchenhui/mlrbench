However, the experiment uses the Claude API model, and the provided code for API-based models (`APIGuidedDecoder` in `models/guided_decoding.py`) does not implement this. Instead, it generates multiple candidate responses and selects the one with the lowest overall uncertainty. The claimed methodology of modifying token probabilities at each step is not what was actually implemented for the reported experiment.",

Generate sample responses... 2. Analyze uncertainty... 3. Select the response with lowest overall uncertainty\""

    "overall_assessment": "The paper is severely compromised by multiple, significant hallucinations. Key citations are nonexistent, the core methodology for guided decoding is misrepresented, and the experimental results are entirely fabricated. The provided code confirms these issues, containing scripts that generate the paper's plots from hardcoded data and logs showing that experiments were run on trivial, synthetic datasets. The work as presented is not credible.",
