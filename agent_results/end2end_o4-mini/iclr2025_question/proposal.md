Title  
Self-Consistency–Evidence Calibration for Hallucination-Aware Uncertainty in Large Language Models  

1. Introduction  
Background  
Foundation models—particularly large language models (LLMs) and multimodal systems—are rapidly finding their way into high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and autonomous decision-making. While these models often output text with seemingly high confidence, they are prone to “hallucinations”—plausible-looking but incorrect or unverifiable statements. In critical applications, unrecognized hallucinations can have severe consequences, from diagnostic errors in medicine to legal misunderstandings. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) offers a principled way to estimate how much trust we should place in a model’s outputs, enabling systems to defer to human experts when confidence is low.  

State of the Art and Gaps  
Existing UQ methods for LLMs fall broadly into two camps: (1) ensemble- and Bayesian-based approaches that approximate predictive distributions at great computational cost, and (2) single-pass diagnostics such as entropy probes or metamorphic relations that may miss subtle fabrications. Recent work (e.g., Dey et al., 2025; Kossen et al., 2024; Fadeeva et al., 2024) has advanced both efficiency and detection accuracy, but critical challenges remain:  
• Computational Efficiency: Ensembles and Monte Carlo methods do not scale to models with hundreds of billions of parameters.  
• Detection Accuracy: Hallucinations can be contextually plausible, making them hard to flag with simple confidence metrics.  
• Scalability: Multi-pass or external-resource-heavy methods struggle under real-time inference constraints.  
• Interpretability: Black-box uncertainty scores fail to provide actionable insights to users.  
• Balancing Creativity and Accuracy: Over-penalizing uncertainty risks stifling a model’s generative richness.  

Research Objectives  
This proposal aims to develop a lightweight, interpretable UQ mechanism that simultaneously quantifies uncertainty and detects hallucinations in LLM outputs without requiring weight updates or expensive ensembling. We will build a two-stage inference pipeline—self-consistency sampling followed by evidence calibration—and integrate token- and segment-level uncertainty into the decoding process. Our objectives are:  
1. Design a scalable self-consistency sampling mechanism to capture inter-chain variance in chain-of-thought outputs.  
2. Develop an evidence retrieval and alignment module that assesses factual support for each sampled chain.  
3. Define interpretable token-level uncertainty metrics combining semantic variance and evidence agreement.  
4. Incorporate dynamic hallucination penalties into autoregressive decoding to guide the model away from high-uncertainty tokens without overly dampening creativity.  
5. Validate the approach on open-domain QA and abstractive summarization benchmarks, evaluating calibration, hallucination reduction, and diversity preservation.  

Significance  
Our method—Self-Consistency–Evidence Calibration (SCEC)—will fill a pressing need for reliable, real-time UQ in foundation models. By providing both global confidence scores and localized uncertainty alerts, SCEC can support human-in-the-loop workflows in sensitive domains. The approach balances computational efficiency, detection accuracy, and interpretability, making it practical for deployment at scale.  

2. Methodology  
Overview  
SCEC operates in three main stages: (A) self-consistency sampling, (B) evidence retrieval and agreement scoring, and (C) uncertainty-guided decoding. Figure 1 (conceptual) illustrates the pipeline.  

2.1 Data Collection and Benchmarks  
We will evaluate on two task types:  
• Open-domain question answering (QA): Datasets include Natural Questions, TriviaQA, and WebQuestions.  
• Abstractive summarization: Datasets include XSum, CNN/DailyMail, and PubMed summarization.  

For each dataset, we will use the publicly available split for training prompts (fine-tuning when applicable), with held-out test sets for evaluation.  

2.2 Self-Consistency Sampling  
Inspired by Wang et al. (2023) and Sedova et al. (2024), we generate $k$ diverse chain-of-thought samples per input prompt by running the LLM with different random seeds or temperature settings. Let $\{y^{(i)}_{1:T}\}_{i=1}^k$ be the $k$ token sequences of length $T$ produced for a prompt $x$. We record the model’s per-token probability distributions $p^{(i)}_t(w)\;=\;P_\theta\bigl(w \mid x,y^{(i)}_{1:t-1}\bigr)$.  

Token-level variability captures model indecision:  
$$u^{\text{var}}_t \;=\;\mathrm{Var}\Bigl(\{p^{(i)}_t(y^{(i)}_t)\}_{i=1}^k\Bigr)\,. $$  

We also compute segment-level divergence by comparing the full sequence distributions, e.g., using KL divergence or JS divergence between each pair of chains.  

2.3 Evidence Retrieval and Agreement Scoring  
For each chain $y^{(i)}$, we identify factual claims or key segments via heuristics (e.g., noun-phrases, named entities). We query an external knowledge store (e.g., Wikipedia index or proprietary domain database) with a dense retriever (e.g., DPR) to obtain top-$m$ supporting passages $\{e^{(i)}_j\}_{j=1}^m$.  

Semantic alignment score between chain claims and retrieved evidence is measured via a pretrained entailment model $f_{\mathrm{ent}}(c,e)$, yielding entailment probabilities. For each token $y^{(i)}_t$ belonging to a claim segment $c^{(i)}_r\,$, let  
$$s^{(i)}_t \;=\;\max_{j=1\ldots m}\;f_{\mathrm{ent}}\bigl(c^{(i)}_r,e^{(i)}_j\bigr)\,. $$  

We then normalize $s^{(i)}_t$ across $i$ to obtain an evidence agreement vector.  

2.4 Combined Uncertainty Score  
We propose a composite uncertainty metric at token $t$:  
$$u_t \;=\;\alpha\,u^{\text{var}}_t\;+\;(1-\alpha)\,\bigl[1 - \tfrac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k s^{(i)}_t\bigr]\,, $$  
where $\alpha\in[0,1]$ balances variance and evidence misalignment. High $u_t$ implies either divergent model beliefs or poor external support.  

2.5 Dynamic Hallucination Penalty in Decoding  
We integrate $u_t$ into beam search or sampling-based decoding by penalizing high-uncertainty tokens. At each time step of inference on a new prompt, after computing $p_t(w)$ from the base LLM, we adjust:  
$$\tilde p_t(w)\;\propto\;p_t(w)\;\exp\bigl(-\beta\,u_t(w)\bigr)\,, $$  
where $u_t(w)$ is the estimated uncertainty if the model selects token $w$ (approximated via interpolation among sampled chains), and $\beta>0$ is a temperature-like coefficient controlling penalty strength. This encourages the model to prefer lower-uncertainty tokens while still allowing creative outputs in low-risk contexts.  

2.6 Experimental Design  
We will compare SCEC against the following baselines:  
• Vanilla LLM decoding (no UQ)  
• Semantic Entropy Probes (Kossen et al., 2024)  
• Ensemble-based UAF (Dey et al., 2025)  
• Claim Conditioned Probability (Fadeeva et al., 2024)  
• MetaQA (Yang et al., 2025)  

Evaluation Metrics  
1. Calibration: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier score to measure alignment between uncertainty scores and true error rates.  
2. Hallucination Detection: Precision, recall, and F1 on a manually annotated subset of outputs indicating factual errors.  
3. Task Performance:  
   – QA: Exact Match (EM), F1 score  
   – Summarization: ROUGE-1/2/L, BERTScore  
4. Diversity: Distinct-n and Self-BLEU to assess the impact on generative variety.  
5. Efficiency: Wall-clock inference overhead vs. vanilla decoding, measured across $k$ samples with $k\in\{5,10,20\}$.  

Ablation Studies  
We will run controlled experiments to isolate the contributions of:  
• Self-consistency variance alone ($\alpha=1$)  
• Evidence calibration alone ($\alpha=0$)  
• Penalty strength $\beta$ variants  
• Retrieval depth $m$ and quality of the entailment model  

2.7 Theoretical Analysis  
We will derive formal guarantees on the relationship between inter-chain variance and model predictive uncertainty, drawing on statistical decision theory (Wang et al., 2023) and convex hull analysis (Discover AI, 2024). Under mild assumptions, we will show that $u_t$ upper bounds the model’s Bayes risk under posterior sampling approximations.  

3. Expected Outcomes & Impact  
Anticipated Technical Contributions  
• A novel two-stage inference framework (SCEC) combining self-consistency sampling with external evidence calibration for UQ and hallucination detection.  
• Token- and segment-level uncertainty metrics that are interpretable and actionable.

Broader Impact  
1. Trustworthy AI in High-Stakes Domains  
By providing reliable uncertainty estimates and hallucination flags, SCEC can help clinicians, lawyers, and policy-makers gauge when to trust AI outputs and when to seek human verification.  

2. Human-in-the-Loop Workflows  
Localized uncertainty alerts allow systems to highlight specific tokens or segments for review, making human oversight more efficient and targeted.  

3. Responsible Deployment
