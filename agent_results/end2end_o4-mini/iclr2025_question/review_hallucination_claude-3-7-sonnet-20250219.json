    "overall_assessment": "The paper contains significant hallucinations, primarily in the form of nonexistent citations from the future (2025), fabricated experimental results, and claims about methodology implementation that wasn't actually completed. While the code repository appears comprehensive at first glance, closer inspection reveals that only minimal experiments were run with 3 examples, and the figures presented in the paper were artificially generated with hardcoded values rather than derived from actual experimental results. These hallucinations substantially undermine the paper's credibility and scientific validity.",
