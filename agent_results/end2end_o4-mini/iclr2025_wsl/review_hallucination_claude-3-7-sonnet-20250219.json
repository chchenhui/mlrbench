However, in the code, we see: 'zoo_manager = ModelZooManager(args.data_dir); models = zoo_manager.generate_synthetic_model_zoo(num_models=args.num_models)' which indicates synthetic model generation rather than using real pre-trained models."

These hallucinations substantially undermine the credibility of the research claims.",
