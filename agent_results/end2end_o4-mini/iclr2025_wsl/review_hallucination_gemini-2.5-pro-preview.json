However, the provided code reveals that the experiments were conducted on a small, synthetically generated model zoo. This fundamentally misrepresents the experimental setup and the validity of the results.",

In contrast, the training script `scripts/train.py` contains the following code: `zoo_manager = ModelZooManager(args.data_dir)` and `models = zoo_manager.generate_synthetic_model_zoo(num_models=args.num_models)`."

The paper reports specific accuracy improvements and reduction in fine-tuning epochs from this experiment. The code, however, contains an explicit placeholder implementation that generates fake accuracy values using a sine function, with comments admitting that this is not a real experiment.",

This directly contradicts the paper's claim in Section 6: 'Embedding‐Based Merging: Best interpolation at α=0.5 achieves accuracy 0.80, outperforming both parents at 0.70 and reducing fine-tuning epochs by ~25%.'"

The formula `W_i^{\\ell,+} = P^\\ell W_i^\\ell S^\\ell` does not correctly represent the transformation of a weight matrix when permuting the output neurons of layer `l-1` (inputs to layer `l`) and scaling the output neurons of layer `l`.",

For a layer transformation `y = Wx + b`, permuting the output neurons with `P` and scaling the input neurons with `S` would result in `W' = P W S`, not `P W S` where S is a scaling matrix applied to the input space."

The code includes scripts specifically designed to generate placeholder figures and results, confirming the fabrication. Additionally, the paper contains at least one nonexistent citation and a mathematically incorrect formulation in its methodology. These findings render the paper's conclusions entirely unreliable.",
